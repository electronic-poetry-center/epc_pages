Both Camille & I were stung repeatedly by large angry black wasps
yesterday who have built a hive in our doorway.  I chased them away
with a stick.

Are you saying all Japanese haiku are 5/7/5, Jess!?
Gah.  For one thing, I thought there was all kinds of
controversy in Japan about whether certain punctuation
marks or the equivalent should count as syllables or
not, etc.

I think my final quick word would be that, yes, no
Enlgish-language poets can make a Japanese haiku in
English that's as good as a Japanese haiku in
Japanese.  But I'm with Mark in believing that there
are English-language haiku that must be as good as an
Japanese haiku--because they seem to me as good as any
English poem I know, and I can't believe any other
language has better poetry than mine.  Here's one of
many I'm starting to think of.  It's by Jonathan
Brannen.  I comment on it all the time:

    Temple Bells

      a petal

      a peal

(I would add that there are English translations of
Japanese haiku that I consider as good as any other
English-language poems I know--which suggests to me
that the translations gained some English-speaking
resonances to make up for the Japanese ones the
originals had that were lost in translation.  And
maybe some concision due to the abstractness of
English lettering compared with Japanese charactry, a
different but equal value.)

Congratz on book and exhibit, Dave.  Do post any
reviews that show up, especially of the exhibit, as
I--for one--am particularly interested in what visual
art critics have to say about visual poetry.

Fascinating post on haiku you just did, too.

The wasps in Ankara are ravenous, swarming beasts. My wife got stung on the
foot last week. She cursed and then killed the wasp. Then a comrade of the
dead wasp came and carried the carcass away. Since then I've been wondering:
What do wasps do with their dead?

Dear Friends,



This week's Ear Inn Reading is an all-Pittsburgh lineup of special guest
poets, so I wanted to make a special effort to invite you poetry
afficianados and connoisseurs to this reading.



Michael Wurster's collections of poetry are Snake Charmer's Daughter
(2000) and The Cruelty of the Desert (1990).



Jane McCreery's chapbook, Before the Fever, was published in 1999; her
work can also be found in the anthology Doors of the Morning (1997).



Ellen Smith's work has received the Zone 3 Rainmaker Award and the
HyperAge Ascher Montandon Award.



I hope you can make it.



Yours,

Michael

furious bee when i was weeding in front of the post office.  they
seemed to live in a hole somewhere along the right egde of the front
of the house.  its energy and sense of purpose was astonishing.

Legend has it that remaining family members endow University Chairs and
buildings to distinguish and honor their histories - whether stinging or
otherwise. I hear a rumor that Dr. Hilton Obenzinger - down at Stanford - is
developing course materials on the history of this particular ritual.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...


KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

        Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

Stephen,

This is not quite accurate.

First you must kill the wasp, then you extract the venom, mix with gin,
then inject into the university.  I myself have offered to endow a wing of
the library for incorrect ideas and absurd notions, but, sad to say, I'm
not a wasp.

Not simply a "now"/ they have been doing that forever. It means
brazenly doing an act that will piss off the powerful.

George,

There's this thing called an iambic penta(contain-)met-er; this
iam-container contains the words that fill the iam-penta-contain-meter to
the brim in any given line of iambic pentameter, such as a line of
Shakespeare.

Then there's projective verse, practioners of which attempt to break the
contain-meter of iams and let the words spill out all over the blank page,
but not necessarily like Apollinaire's rain or, for example, words knit up
like an Arabic calligraphic pear. Furthermore, the initial practioners put
the results of all this on paper via a typewriter.

Also, the projectivists believe that they break the iam-container by
ejaculating words and phrases according to the systole and diastole of the
heart and the inhalation and exhalation of breath.

I hope this was of some help.

Matt Keenan

Is that a true fact George Bowering? Are you too literal? My whole
thesis will have to change: "Canadian postmodernism has been a long
process of debeaverization, beavers being CanadianContent wherever they
appear."

If beavers are references how do they build dams?

the form of a cup and the coffee content is not analogous to the form
(typesetting/vocalization/gesture) of a poem and the "content" of the
meaning we make with the transition it makes into our sensory locale.
in this sense, you could say that there is no content in form.

Look at it this way: even though there is a mountain under your feet,
you still have to climb it. The content is the *potential* the audience
themselves bring to life in the poem.

Just like the 'you can't step in the same river twice' metaphor,
although content/experience flows through the mind it nevertheless has a
place to go.

What was left of the Wasp ended up in a visible field, but not much
Echo decided debate and not enough queen forced to find years before,
too ill to exchange the unpredictable. This book is supposed to be
flowery, administered like those not excerpted, she explained, comes
from pressure that it's not the Evolution of wisdom by Plants. However,
a parasitic wasp is being unsightly, but suffered substantial Skinny
dipping among the catalpa trees. The awful thing about coming home is
not opening for a Shine's tiny gold emblazoned with "Everything's Not
Lost"; not released, retired his wife's eyes after intentionally or
not, The Way We Were hits on a dark truth, its privileged moment
defiled by contact with renaissance and I could feel air conditioning
with not a drop I thought. Someone had been getting the word out by the
garden. A respondent answered that it was probably a cicada not often
addressed by historians. In fact a bastion of social power set fire to
roof timbers. We would advise strongly anyone trying an improvised
flame thrower thinking about a career in only insects which can cause
problems. Then you mention how much she smokes and the usual girl story
as the name implies, people sting not only to protect themselves, but
to protect their entire ethnic humor. Dynamic is able to invoke a
service that was not known prior to serious danger of folding and could
not.

You put the content there when you come to read the poem. It's not so simple
when you're writing one. But as we know, the reader will  seldom find the
same content that you did.
                 how's life as the Laureate? And where have you moved to?
Worrried, Broms

  He passed forth and new aduenture sought/As one that inly mournd so
was she sad/Add faith vnto your force and be not faint/Whose sences all
were straight benumbd and starke/And said Ah Sir my liege Lord and my
loue/She was in life and euery vertuous lore/Thus ill bestedd and
fearefull more of shame/With gentle blandishment and louely looke/And
vnto Morpheus comes whom drowned deepe/His dwelling is there Tethys his
wet bed/Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought/He taught to
imitate that Lady trew/But full of fire and greedy hardiment/His holy
things each morne and euentyde.

  Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast/And homebred euill ye desire to
heare/And said Ah Sir my liege Lord and my loue/All suddenly about his
body wound/Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde/And often knockt
his brest as one that did repent/For all so deare as life is to my
hart/The Aspine good for staues the Cypresse funerall/What frayes ye
that were wont to comfort me affrayd.

  Her swollen hart her speach seemd to bereaue/Be well aware quoth then
that Ladie milde/Ah Ladie said he shame were to reuoke/At length they
chaunst to meet vpon the way/Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of
shame/So pure and innocent as that same lambe/Had made a Lady of that
other Spright/Of such as drunke her life the which them nurst.

  And lifting vp his lompish head with blame/Her doubtfull words made
that redoubted knight/A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest/And
fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes/As Lyon fierce vpon the flying
pray/Till that some end they finde or in or out/Of sundry shapes yet all
ill fauored.

  A fit false dreame that can delude the sleepers sent/His gall did
grate for griefe and high disdaine/A Gentle Knight was pricking on the
plaine/Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride/Armed to point sought
backe to turne againe/By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly/What
frayes ye that were wont to comfort me affrayd/God helpe the man so
wrapt in Errours endlesse traine/The fearefull Dwarfe this is no place
for liuing men/The caruer Holme the Maple seeldom inward sound/Of
ancient kings and queenes that had of yore/She lookt about and seeing
one in mayle.

  Vnder a vele that wimpled was full low/Ah my deare Sonne quoth he how
should alas/And Poets sage the Firre that weepeth still/Sucking vpon her
poisonous dugs each one/Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe/That
wasteth all this countrey farre and neare/Did spred so broad that
heauens light did hide/That weaker sence it could haue rauisht
quight/But forth vnto the darksome hole he went/Where cause is none but
to your rest depart.

  A fit false dreame that can delude the sleepers sent/So slyding softly
forth she turnd as to her ease/Her filthy parbreake all the place
defiled has/Then of the certaine perill he stood in/Wherein the Hermite
dewly wont to say/Quoth then that aged man the way to win.

  With timely pride aboue the Aegyptian vale/So with that godly father
to his home they went/And proou'd your strength on a strong enimie/Yet
armes till that time did he neuer wield/Vpon his foe a Dragon horrible
and stearne/The caruer Holme the Maple seeldom inward sound/And made him
dreame of loues and lustfull play/To aide his friends or fray his
enimies/The one of them he gaue a message too/Yea but quoth she the
perill of this place/Amid the thickest woods The Champion stout.

  Deuoure their dam on whom while so he gazd/That when he heard in great
perplexitie/Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile/There was
an holy chappell edifyde/Now needeth him no lenger labour spend/And
often knockt his brest as one that did repent/But hasty heat tempring
with sufferance wise.

  Who nought aghast his mightie hand enhaunst/The builder Oake sole king
of forrests all/Yet thus perforce he bids me do or die/Thus ill bestedd
and fearefull more of shame/And angry Ioue an hideous storme of
raine/And homebred euill ye desire to heare/Which when the valiant Elfe
perceiu'd he lept/Of ancient Kings and Queenes that had of yore/Vnder
blake stole hyding her bayted hooke/So slyding softly forth she turnd as
to her ease/Her mournefull plaintes beguiled of her art/And like to lead
the labyrinth about.

  And vnto morpheus comes whom drowned deepe/Vnder a vele that wimpled
was full low/Yet thus perforce he bids me do or die/And made him dreame
of loues and lustfull play/Eftsoones dismounted from his courser
braue/Their dam vpstart out of her den effraide.

  And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise/Her all in white he clad and
ouer it/The fearefull Dwarfe this is no place for liuing men/The cruell
markes of many' a bloudy fielde/But with his clownish hands their tender
wings/Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred/Whose sences all were
straight benumbd and starke/The other all with siluer ouercast/Vertue
giues her selfe light through darkenesse for to wade/As gentle Shepheard
in sweete euen-tide.

  Eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue/And forth he cald out of
deepe darknesse dred/Huge heapes of mudd he leaues wherein there
breed/Your first aduenture many such I pray/The youthfull knight could
not for ought be staide/He told of Saintes and Popes and euermore/But
full of fire and greedy hardiment/Strangle her else she sure will
strangle thee.



The Anatomy Of The Western World #0002



  Bidding his beades all day for his trespas/And perill without show
therefore your stroke/And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise/Whereat
he gan to stretch but he againe/And said Faire knight borne vnder happy
starre/Remounted vp as light as chearefull Larke/And said Faire knight
borne vnder happy starre/But when his later spring gins to auale/At last
resoluing forward still to fare.

  They cannot finde that path which first was showne/Long way he
trauelled before he heard of ought/And dead as liuing euer him
ador'd/Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has/His foes haue
slaine themselues with whom he should contend/All cleane dismayd to see
so vncouth sight/His Ladie seeing all that chaunst from farre/As much
disdayning to the curbe to yield/The noblest mind the best contentment
has/Her fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight/Of such as drunke
her life the which them nurst.

  Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of shame/Watching to banish Care
their enimy/Weening their wonted entrance to haue found/Then rudely he
him thrust and pusht with paine/Of swarming Bees did cast him in a
swowne/And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes/The messenger
approching to him spake/And mightie causes wrought in heauen
aboue/Captiu'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares/Of swarming Bees did
cast him in a swowne.

  A little lowly hermitage it was/May euer passe but thorough great
distresse/But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise/Legions of
Sprights the which like little flyes/That when he heard in great
perplexitie/Watching to banish Care their enimy/A Gentle Knight was
pricking on the plaine/Hymen iô Hymen dauncing all around/Bathed in
wanton blis and wicked ioy/Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets
raw/Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine/In hast vnto his Lord where
he him left afore.

  Doth euer wash and Cynthia still doth steepe/Or the blind God that
doth me thus amate/Yet she much whiter but the same did hide/Resolv'd in
minde all suddenly to win/With loathly frogs and toades which eyes did
lacke/Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate/With bowres and beds and
Ladies deare delight/But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine/You
whom my hard auenging destinie/When ruddy phoebus gins to welke in
west/Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes/When ruddy Phoebus
gins to welke in west.

  He passed forth and new aduenture sought/Arriued there the little
house they fill/Approcht in hast to greet his victorie/May euer passe
but thorough great distresse/I better wot then you though now too
late/Who nought aghast his mightie hand enhaunst/Whiles sad Night ouer
him her mãtle black doth spred/So pure and innocent as that same
lambe/So with that godly father to his home they went/Such vgly
monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed/Vnder a vele that wimpled was
full low.

  Vntill the blustring storme is ouerblowne/And cursed heauen and spake
reprochfull shame/Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde/quoth then
that aged man the way to win/But wander too and fro in wayes
vnknowne/Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe/As still are wont
t'annoy the walled towne/And cursed heauen and spake reprochfull
shame/Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe/His dwelling is by which
no liuing wight.

  In secret anguish and vnpittied plaint/Of a straunge man I can you
tidings tell/Great Gorgon Prince of darknesse and dead night/Which of
all earthly things he most did craue/Least suddaine mischiefe ye too
rash prouoke/Vntroubled night they say giues counsell best/But on his
brest a bloudie Crosse he bore/A little lowly Hermitage it was/Where
when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes/Downe in a dale hard by a
forests side/He strowd an Aue-Mary after and before/For that old man of
pleasing wordes had store.

  With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe/Armed to point
sought backe to turne againe/So liuely and so like in all mens
sight/Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe/Behind her farre away a
Dwarfe did lag/So slyding softly forth she turnd as to her ease/But his
wast wordes returnd to him in vaine/Faire venus seemde vnto his bed to
bring/Therefore I read beware Fly fly quoth then.

  With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe/Loue of your selfe
she said and deare constraint/The caruer Holme the Maple seeldom inward
sound/With timely pride aboue the aegyptian vale/He bad awake blacke
Plutoes griesly Dame.

  The messenger approching to him spake/Yet was in knots and many
boughtes vpwound/For that old man of pleasing wordes had store/Cast a
blacke stole most like to seeme for Vna fit/With faire discourse the
euening so they pas/And often knockt his brest as one that did
repent/Where he slept soundly void of euill thought/That greatest
Glorious Queene of Faerie lond/Vpon a great aduenture he was bond/And
dead as liuing euer him ador'd/That promist ayde the tempest to
withstand.

  Whose semblance she did carrie vnder feigned hew/And said Ah Sir my
liege Lord and my loue/Ne let vaine feares procure your needlesse
smart/And on his litle winges the dreame he bore/For to all knighthood
it is foule disgrace/Therefore with me ye may take vp your In/That for
my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew/Groning full deadly all with
troublous feare/His heauie head deuoide of carefull carke/Yet kindling
rage her selfe she gathered round/That euery wight to shrowd it did
constrain/Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say/Shooke him so hard that
forced him to speake.


The Anatomy Of The Western World #0003



  He started vp as seeming to mistrust/They cannot finde that path which
first was showne/Then of the certaine perill he stood in/To be the
chastest flowre that ay did spring/Ay wont in desert darknesse to
remaine/Where he slept soundly void of euill thought/And to him playnd
how that false winged boy.

  Yet she much whiter but the same did hide/The cruell markes of many' a
bloudy fielde/Die is my dew yet rew my wretched state/Be well aware
quoth then that Ladie milde/And cursed heauen and spake reprochfull
shame/Arriued there the little house they fill/Wherein the Hermite dewly
wont to say.

  Vpon a great aduenture he was bond/Whiles you in carelesse sleepe are
drowned quight/And then againe begun My weaker yeares/Y cladd in mightie
armes and siluer shielde/And well could file his tongue as smooth as
glas/A shadie groue not far away they spide/And said Faire knight borne
vnder happy starre.

  Legions of Sprights the which like little flyes/The Sunne that
measures heauen all day long/At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean
waues emong/Breedes dreadfull doubts oft fire is without smoke/Gathred
themselues about her body round/He faire the knight saluted louting
low/Might there be heard but carelesse Quiet lyes/To proue his sense and
tempt her faigned truth.

  That such a cursed creature liues so long a space/The cruell markes of
many' a bloudy fielde/And henceforth euer wish that like succeed it
may/Such vgly monstrous shapes elswhere may no man reed/Whose semblance
she did carrie vnder feigned hew/Of swarming Bees did cast him in a
swowne/And by descent from Royall lynage came/The maker selfe for all
his wondrous witt.

  For this same night The knight was well content/The Sprite then gan
more boldly him to wake/So liuely and so like in all mens sight/That
makes them doubt their wits be not their owne/His Ladie seeing all that
chaunst from farre/Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes/Amid
the bowels of the earth full steepe/Let me not dye in languor and long
teares/Bathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy/And forth he cald out of
deepe darknesse dred.

  Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy/Captiu'd to fortune
and frayle worldly feares/Then rudely he him thrust and pusht with
paine/His Ladie seeing all that chaunst from farre/So pure and innocent
as that same lambe/As when old father Nilus gins to swell/No other noyse
nor peoples troublous cryes/Bathed in wanton blis and wicked ioy/Why
Dame quoth he what hath ye thus dismayd/He taught to imitate that Lady
trew/For hoped loue to winne me certaine hate/To Morpheus house doth
hastily repaire/Is wisely to aduise now day is spent/As one for knightly
giusts and fierce encounters fitt/That troublous dreame gan freshly
tosse his braine.

  Vpon his foe and his new force to learne/That detestable sight him
much amazde/That detestable sight him much amazde/And turning fierce her
speckled taile aduaunst/Breedes dreadfull doubts oft fire is without
smoke/And euer-drizling raine vpon the loft/His grasping hold and from
her turne him backe.

  The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yuory/His forces faile ne can no
longer fight/They flocked all about her bleeding wound/Sucking vpon her
poisonous dugs each one/The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yuory/In sort
as he him schooled priuily/Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse
burst.

  The one of them he gaue a message too/Or the blind God that doth me
thus amate/Ye all forwearied be for what so strong/The drouping Night
thus creepeth on them fast/They flocked all about her bleeding
wound/Both for her noble bloud and for her tender youth/Now sayd the
Lady draweth toward night/In this great passion of vnwonted lust/Yet
nothing did he dread but euer was ydrad/She was in life and euery
vertuous lore.

  And with false shewes abuse his fantasy/Her fawning loue with foule
disdainefull spight/The other all with siluer ouercast/Of sundry shapes
yet all ill fauored/And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise/Soone as
that vncouth light vpon them shone/His gall did grate for griefe and
high disdaine/The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake/Halfe angry
asked him for what he came/His gall did grate for griefe and high
disdaine/Of such said he I chiefly do inquere/Yet was in knots and many
boughtes vpwound/Not all content yet seemd she to appease/Sober he
seemde and very sagely sad.

  Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst/That troublous dreame
gan freshly tosse his braine/Mixt with a murmuring winde much like the
sowne/Ioying to heare the birdes sweete harmony/To aide his friends or
fray his enimies/In hast vnto his lord where he him left afore/Approcht
in hast to greet his victorie.

  Her fawning loue with foule disdainefull spight/Now when that ydle
dreame was to him brought/But his wast wordes returnd to him in
vaine/Great Gorgon Prince of darknesse and dead night/With holy father
sits not with such things to mell/In drowsie fit he findes of nothing he
takes keepe/Faire Venus seemde vnto his bed to bring/That path they take
that beaten seemd most bare.

  She lookt about and seeing one in mayle/And mightie causes wrought in
heauen aboue/Sweet slõbring deaw the which to sleepe them biddes/And
this faire couple eke to shroud theselues were fain/That lasie seemd in
being euer last/That soone to loose her wicked bands did her
constraine/Mixt with a murmuring winde much like the sowne/That
troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine/Their scepters stretcht
from East to Westerne shore.

I thoroughly enjoyed watching Matt educate Canada's poet laureate on
pentameter. Are you cocking a snook if you do not intend to, or does it
imply intention, that grandish awareness? George, when I see you in a
poem, you are content.

Dont worry abt a thing, compadre. Jean and I have just spent a month
crossing the continent inb my Volvo, including 4 days in your beloved
Saskatchewan. Now we are in Port Colborne, Ont., a half-hour drive
from Buffalo, but all the people have left Buffalo. Jeeze. I did
visit Hemingway's grave, and Pound's birthplace, just down the road.

Well, well, well. President George was in one hell of bind this week =
when it turned that that Saudi Arabia funded Al Qaeda, not Iraq. =
Realizing we'd invaded the wrong country, Bush did the honorable thing: =
he's come out against gay marriages.

This caused some real confusion in my staff where a gay member of our =
investigations team announced he was changing his allegiance from Howard =
Dean to George Bush. "Bush Saves Gays from Marriage! Bush Saves Gays!" =
he rushed around the office beaming. "Gay people exempt from going to =
in-laws for Thanksgiving dinner! Gay-mericans exempt from PTA meetings =
and hiring divorce lawyers!"

But then I had to bring him down to earth. ('Had to' because, while Bush =
announced last month that our conquest of Iraq had made 'the world a =
safer place', our President mentioned THIS week there's now a 'real =
threat' of new Al Qaeda hijackings. So is America safer ? As long as one =
stays indoors.)

But here's the real kick in the head. Turns out that unlike the 18 =
minutes missing from the Nixon tape, the 28 pages missing from Congress' =
publicly released report on the September 11 attack has been found. And =
it turns out to be a summary of Saudi Arabia's financing of terrorist =
fronts including the 'charities' supporting Al Qaeda.

And now, the New York Times tells us, the US Senate has been embarrassed =
into holding hearings on those Saudi charity fronts including one named =
WAMY.

Of course, this is ancient news to those who watched my report on WAMY =
and Saudi funding of terror -- broadcast on BBC's evening news on =
November 9, 2001. (In the USA, that report earned me the title of =
'conspiracy nut.' In America, a 'conspiracy nut' is defined as a =
journalist who reports the news two years before the New York Times.)

And here's the ugly little punch line to the story you WON'T read in the =
Times. Why has the Bush Administration covered up for WAMY and the =
Saudi's other blood-soaked 'charity' operations?

For the answer, let me take you back to Midland, Texas, 1986. A young =
old man, George W. Bush, seems to have trouble finding oil. But he =
strikes it rich when his failing drilling partnership is bought out by =
Harken Oil. Despite the addition of the business acumen of Bush Jr., =
Harken faces collapse; but it's pulled from the brink by a cash infusion =
from a Saudi, Sheik Bakhsh. The money from Arabia has nothing to do, we =
must assume, with Dubya's daddy at the time holding the post of =
Vice-President of the Free World.

The Bakhsh booty continued a pattern of the young Bush being saved from =
his dire business decisions by a line of Sheik angels. His first oil =
company, Arbusto, going bust-o, was aided by the American financial =
representative of the bin Laden family.

And on BBC TV last month, I reported this: following the bombing of our =
embassies, the Clinton Administration sent two delegations to Saudi =
Arabia to tell their royal highnesses to stop giving money to the guys =
who are killing us. But Mr. Bush, once in office, put the kibosh on =
unfriendly words to the Saudis.

Furthermore, in the summer of 2001, Mr. Bush disbanded the US =
intelligence unit tracking funding of Al Qaeda. What is it our G-men =
were uncovering? According to two separate sources speaking to BBC, the =
funders of Al Qaeda fronts, including those who have previously funded =
Bush family business and political ventures.

Now that's a wee bit embarrassing. Something you wouldn't want in a =
congressional report. Something you may not want the FBI to dwell on. =
(And you can unlock the women and children: the BBC reports will NOT be =
broadcast on US television.)

And there's this: a document marked "Secret" and "199I" (meaning =
'national security') which found its way out of the offices of the FBI =
in into the office of our BBC/Guardian newspaper team. It indicates (and =
whistleblowers confirmed) that, prior to the September 11 attack, the =
Bush Administration held back agents of the FBI from tracking two =
members of the bin Laden family. According to the buried FBI report, the =
bin Laden lads were operating in the USA for "a suspected terrorist =
organization", WAMY.

But we mustn't ask too many questions of the Bush Administration's =
blindfolding the FBI, nor, Heaven forbid, discomfit the Saudis over =
their contributions to Terror-R-Us. After all, in BushWorld, Saudi =
Arabia and America have shared values: we want our boys to kill, not to =
kiss.

Democracy Money Can Buy, which includes the award-winning report, "Did =
Our President Spike the Investigation of bin Laden?" View his report for =
BBC Television's Newsnight on Bush, WAMY and the bin Ladens at =

When I read Fulcrum was put out on your own dime Phillip,  I wanted to
read it before responding to Patrick's fine but condeming words as,
briefly spotlighted, I can now accept & join the legions of under rated
poets. As well, I was reminded of over a decade ago when I bankrolled
all this money from a questionable act into a legitimate publishing
venture: a literary journal as well as a full length book in both hard &
soft cover editions. As the summer continues, and my sunflowers grow two
foot in the past days, wow, over a week now, since the first posting,
there will be no turn to Fulcrum in a time span considered acceptable in
this motile moment of information spreading. This subject will bury
itself under an easy month or more of other facts people hastily respond
to through their importance.

What I will respond to is brief, besides a congratulations and deals
with primely with the forward and a few critical essays. Poetry is not
so much the art of talking to oneself, as a balancing act on the see-saw
ends resting between the paths of talking, listening and hearing. Assert
distinctions. And yet there is an adept visual element ignored in most
philosophical poem treatises, hence part of their failure, their belief
that form is entirely of a metrical or other repititious posture. The
poem itself is the visual act, with the inherent difference being how I
am able to transcribe from a field I can listen to after first written.

Audience is a tautology which says nothing about the poet, one needs to
distinguish the difference between the poem and the person. A confusion
here will mess things up tremendously, we could have a WHAT IF, a
twilight zone of poetry otherwise. What if Baratier never discovered
Keats' "you"? What if Stevens never went to the Armory Show?  The poem
starts at a moment, radiates outward and cares naught for its audience
or creator, then time erodes the completeness, changes the "complete"
meaning from moment to moment when revisited, when written about over
decades. Yet there is a current group of readers that gives hope of
continuance, at least 3 of the sacred twelve audience members are here
on this list, sometimes more, which make the poem durable, not through
their critcism, as they are visiting a "finished" piece, but rather
through the act of reading it. This becomes the undercurrent of the
overinformation age, a setback into anti-technology where the spare
audience is in equal valence with monks hand transcribing texts
centuries ago.

I was reminded of nonsequiturs through Charles' mention of them being
the shortest distance between two points as well as the back of a Too
Much Coffee Man comic I was reading in which the term cannot be
accurately defined because the moment you use one, you are in need of
pointing out it's use for definition's sake thereby invalidating the
term. There was some grand exit out of this writing dealing with this
concept, a comparative loop to make the head spin, a image or metaphor
about making my living on poetry, not on theory, but I could not
complete it. Maybe it was in the analogy of _FULCRUM an annual of poetry
and aesthetics_  as my wife is an aesthetician, a professional; her
aesthetics in poetry differ greatly from mine.


Be well

An artist has caused outrage by planning to graft a biotech ear on to his
arm

Paul Harris
Sunday August 3, 2003
The Observer

It will shock. But then that's what modern art is all about. In a move that
takes art to unheard of extremes, a British-based artist is to transplant a
human ear on to his arm.

Using techniques of advanced plastic surgery, performance artist Stelarc,
originally called Stelios Arcadiou, is to grow the ear in a biotech
laboratory and have it grafted on to his forearm.

Even in an art world used to the antics of Tracy Emin and Damien Hirst, the
Extra Ear project will cause upset. Many critics of unusual modern art say =
a
fringe of the movement is caught in an 'arms race' of stunts that have
little artistic merit but plenty of shock value. Last month a French artist
cut off his own finger with an axe and donated it to a museum.

'He [Stelarc] is not exploring anything artistic at all. He's just putting
an ear on his arm. There is an area of modern art where people just think
they can compete to do the most outlandish things. This is not art,' said
David Lee, editor of arts magazine Jackdaw.

Stelarc defended his work as an exploration of how it is possible to change
the human body. His previous works have focused on using machinery and
computers to create extensions of the human form. He has built robotic head=
s
and hands that he has controlled, and a six-legged walking machine. 'The
issue is not to shock. I want people to see this extra ear and speculate in
a way about alternative interfaces on the body. Some people may be repulsed=
,
but it is not the intention,' he said.

Stelarc, 57, who is Australian, holds a post at Nottingham Trent University
as a principal research fellow at the Performance Arts Digital Research
Unit. He has put on shows in Europe, Japan and the United States and uses
medical instruments, prosthetics and robotics in his displays. He once
inserted a capsule into his stomach with flashing lights and noises. For hi=
s
ear project, Stelarc approached British doctors and medical bodies for help=
,
but none would take on the operation.

However, the Australian-based Tissue Culture and Art project has agreed to
help him grow the ear. Stelarc hopes to begin the project next month,
growing the ear and having surgeons attach it to his body. A plan to put th=
e
ear on Stelarc's face was abandoned as it could damage nerves in his cheeks=
=2E

Samples of Stelarc's cartilage and bone marrow will be taken and grown in a
laboratory. The cartilage will be nurtured into the shape of an ear, simila=
r
to the technique used to grow ears on laboratory mice. The ear will then be
surgically placed under a flap of skin on Stelarc's arm, where it will
develop its own blood supply.

The ear will be sculpted into shape by plastic surgeons who will give it
lobes from skin grafts and shape the flesh on Stelarc's arm. The ear will b=
e
a permanent part of Stelarc's body. 'I will always have something up my
sleeve,' he joked.

Stelarc hopes to fit the ear with a sound chip and a proximity censor so
that it can emit sounds or words when people approach.

Some artists are appalled. 'This is not art; this is sad. The worst thing i=
s
that art students end up following this sort of thing and, if this is a
success, we'll probably eventually get students leaving college with toes
growing out of their foreheads or something equally bizarre,' said Charles
Thomson, founder of the Stuckists group of artists, which campaigns against
many forms of modern art in favour of more traditional painting and drawing=
=2E
Founded four years ago by 12 artists who reject the work of Emin and Hirst,
it now has 68 groups around the world.

The British Medical Association warned of dangers in the planned operation.
'Potential problems may be unknown at this stage. The artist needs to
understand this before he gives informed consent to the "operation",' a
spokeswoman said.

One thing all agree on is that the project will get many people talking
about art in a way that paintings and sculptures rarely do. 'It causes
discussion,' said Lee. 'And at the end of the day that is not a bad thing.'

A survey of sand under my bare feet
a half conscious glass of water
and over a shamble the well rises
which shakes the medicines
the bash to move physical properties
making a hissing sound as a state of being
“a special trustworthy military is hard to find”
the speck of justice who spells his life
a sudden small pigeon over the fairy ears
a static of enough flood
the stamp is a company
to follow ones cows costs
stubble and technique

Does anyone need an NYC sublet?

We'll be away at a residency for several months and are looking for
some nice folks to sublet our place...the price is flexible if the
person is wiling to forward mail/deal with some phone messages/care for
fish, plants and possibly a cat...

Here's the deal:

Looking for person or persons to sublet furnished apartment with all
amenities from Oct. 1 to end of April, with possibility to extend. One
bedroom plus in Caroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Quiet tree-lined, gardened
street. Two blocks from train. Beautiful airy, sunlit space with
kitchen, bathroom, living room, library/den, bedroom and small office.
Recently painted floor-through with six big windows. Views of trees and
gardens. Call Tommy or Caroline at 718-855-7323 or email at
omalleytommyo@aol.com

Beavers build dams.

The word "beavers" in a poem is a reference. Beavers are contained in
the world. The content of a book is, perhaps, paper, ink, glue.

Just to set the record straight, I've known and admired Stelarc for years.
Go to Beehive - there's an interview I did with him a few years ago. There
is also a lot of other material online. He's one of the most articulate
and brilliant artists around. Btw he's also rather gentle.

Hi Michael Rothenberg,

Thanks for your response.  I've been laid up for the last week with poison ivy
on my legs, and most excruciatingly -- between my fingers.  So I haven't wanted
to type anything.  Now it's getting better, but I don't want to push it.

I got it while clearing brush after our tornado.  I guess I didn't see the
stuff, because I can't recall a contact point.

I wanted again to mention The Power Broker, by Robert Caro.  It's about Robert
Moses, the man who was the Chairman of Parks throughout most of New York State,
but especially the Manhattan area for fifty years or so.  He had more power than
the mayor.  Even the president (Roosevelt) couldn't reign him in.  He made his
money from Triborough Bridge receipts, which were his to keep.  Well, that was
just one source.

He built parks, and parkways (he built the parkways on Long Island with bridges
over them so low that busses couldn't pass underneath so that poor people
couldn't get out to the beaches such as Jones Beach).

He also loved to kill neighborhoods.  He built the Cross-Bronx Expressway right
through a Jewish neighborhood in the Bronx and deliberately took out thousands
of apartments.  He claimed to be resettling the occupants, but he never did.
Nobody helped them, even the elderly and the blind, find another place to live.
And for three years anybody not hit with the axe had to deal with the dynamite
going off as Moses blasted through granite to dig the deep trench through the
Bronx.  Here's a tiny quote from page 868 (the book is 1150 pages long, and is
the best primer on New York City and parks that you could possibly imagine --
the book won a National Book Award in 1974):

"Understanding this, whenthe housewives of East Tremont fought now, it was with
a sense of desperation.  The poverty of their community made fighting all the
harder.  Years later, an acquaintance casually remarked to Lillian Edelstein
that another group of housewives, Central Park West housewives, had, in a battle
over expansion of the Tavern-on the Green parking lot in 1956, won a victory
over Robert Moses -- and was startled to see the eyes of the tall, dignified
woman filling with tears of remembered frustration.  "Do you know why?"  she
said bitterly.  "Because they had money for an injunction, that's why."

So this community of thousands of people had the Cross-Bronx Expressway slammed
thorugh it when Moses could have gone next to a park (Crotona PArk) and saved
something like 80 buildings.  Moses, for reasons never explained, went through
their neighborhood.  Nobody reported it, because Moses owned all the key
government players, and was paying them huge fees to keep quiet.

Somehow when Moses was told not to make images, God must not have been thinking
about investigative reporting.

Ask Meltzer!

I think he was only thinking about images like the pyramids that would attempt
to rival his own creation??

Oy vey, as some would say.

Hi Arielle,

If someone were to make a film about Verse Press, could this logically be called
"the Zapruder film"?

Mina Loy staring through mesh at wooden stars. Some
semblance of hypodermic memory, of a fluid she caught
somewhere in her throat, mussed and tassled. I was
wondering perhaps if those clocks that climb through
walls scarred by nicotine were in fact the apparatus
we would be breathing through this evening. No-one
could reallly answer her; the sky, lanced with crystal
hairs of lightning, acknowledge these fastened hours
in which, just by listening quietly, sound became a
long insect rolling loudly through the hallways,
beyond touch.

I love most, when night is electric, weeping makeup,
throwing my hands through the tattoed and aroused
vectors of her skin. Mina Loy, staring up at the
ceiling, jackandcoke: each time she thought to lie
back, sink into the lattice of dark fingers stretching
her across luscious ice, the lights came on; everyone
danced the electric slide. I know what my life did to
me. She twirled like the limp of a baglady, lagging,
gutted by years that drown so sweetly in this wind.
And when Mina Loy finally got back, she brought
Anemone to tears: everyone could hear them breaking in
the hallway.

Will I always? And if so, what exterminator could
judge her right?

Nimble, with sour assonance. As sardonic as nights
gingerly swept from the awe of your coat.

We were asked for reprinting rights
for one of authors who is a lawyer,
Simon Perchik, for an anthology
of poets who are (or were, when living) lawyers.

They asked me for advice about others
Wallace Stevens and Archibald MacLeish
come to mind immediately. Can anyone
think of any others?

This is a good chance to slip in some experimental
writing with a very traditional publisher & anthology
&  I would hate to see the exposure pass.

Backchannels appreciated.

for me, my laptop is for work on the go: when i have
time for some extra code jobs or really need to cram
to get a project finished. i'm not running intensive
graphics programs or doing hardcore networking -- i'm
coding, and that's about it. because of that, i want a
laptop that's gonna be rock solid, run fast and
smooth, and isn't going to weigh me down. i think a
Mac is good for all of that -- you're not going to be
contending with the (ahem) glitchiness of a Windows OS
(i'm not trying to start a browser war, but for a
computer system that you don't have to think about --
a plug 'n' play OS -- it's gotta be Mac)... and you've
got stable and lightweight hardware to carry. i
actually find an iBook (boosted up to 512MB RAM) suits
me quite well.

Drawn and quartered

They're funny until they get mad. Editorial cartoonists in the United
States are at war with each other. DOUG SAUNDERS describes the battlefield

By DOUG SAUNDERS
Monday, August 4, 2003 - Page R1

It sounds like a badly drawn caricature, but it really happened. Last
week, agents from the United States Secret Service stepped into the lobby
of The Los Angeles Times and asked if they could see the paper's editorial
cartoonist about a small matter of insurrection.

The cartoonist, Michael Ramirez, had drawn a cartoon a few days before
showing President George W. Bush with a gun held to his head. It was an
artistically accurate copy of a famous Vietnam War photo showing the
street execution of a Vietnamese man. In the cartoon, the assailant was
labelled "politics" and the background was labelled "Iraq."

The President's men in black did not find it funny at all. It was a direct
call for assassination, they explained. "The Secret Service does take
threats against all of their protectees very seriously, and they have an
obligation to look into any threat that's made against any of their
protectees," one agent explained shortly before they visited the Times.

The men in the dark sunglasses, blithely unaware of the newspaper
traditions of stark allegory and visual hyperbole, had lifted a heavy rock
to expose a teeming, little-seen artistic subculture fraught with arcane
disputes, political disagreements and deep-set angst. The world of North
American editorial cartooning has never received such official attention.

The newspaper's editors, knowing their rights, refused to let the spooks
into the building. And the Secret Service suffered one of its larger
embarrassments.

If they had looked at the cartoon more closely, they might have realized
that Ramirez is a conservative Republican cartoonist, one of the few truly
ardent supporters of Bush in that ink-stained profession.

"He's probably the most right-wing cartoonist at any major American
newspaper," said Steve Kelley, the cartoonist with The New Orleans
Times-Picayune, himself a moderate conservative.

Ramirez, in his characteristically ham-fisted but elegantly drawn style,
was trying to say that his president's patriotic policies had become the
victim of partisanship. "President Bush is the target, metaphorically
speaking, of a political assassination because of 16 words that he uttered
in the State of the Union [address]," the cartoonist explained.

Within the tight-knit world of American editorial cartooning, a faint
snicker could be heard: Was Ramirez getting a taste of his own ideological
medicine? But, typical of this strange community, the loudest words were
devoted not to the politics but to the esthetics.

"I think in this case, Mike Ramirez probably needed a good editor at this
point, because I don't think that the metaphor really extended to the
point where it was clearly understood," said Jack Ohman, the cartoonist
with The Portland Oregonian.

Those are fighting words, and editorial cartoonists are capable of
fighting long and hard over such matters as the thickness of lines, the
size of caricatured noses, the shape of a box, the placement and quantity
of words in a cartoon, and, most heatedly, the use of crosshatching.

In fact, until the Secret Service came along, the loudest debate among
cartoonists was between the "hatchers" -- those who use drawn grids to
shade their images -- and their foes, who accuse them of complacency and
visual fuddy-duddiness.

This is, in fact, a political debate. The crosshatchers and
nose-stretchers have come under assault from a group of upstart
cartoonists who call themselves "alties" -- short for alternative -- who
draw angry, sarcastic cartoons in a text-heavy, busy postmodern style that
often incorporates parodies of TV advertising and Rex Morgan, MD.

These cartoonists -- including Tom Tomorrow, Ruben Bolling and Ted Rall --
got their start in city entertainment weeklies and fringe publications
such as World War Three Illustrated. Their style is jarring and funny
enough that it has been picked up by a number of major U.S. dailies --
though, because they tend to be far to the left of the U.S. cartooning
mainstream, they tend to attract endless letters to the editor, and
editors often ban their work.

Ted Rall, for instance, sparked a major media controversy last year when
he drew a cartoon mocking "terror widows" -- the wives of victims such as
murdered Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl who seemed to have
become TV sensations. That cartoon was banned by The Washington Post and
other publications, and turned Rall into something of a pariah.

Rall has led the attack by the "alties" on the "nasties" -- the mainstream
cartoonists, who tend to model their style after Thomas Nast, the early
20th-century cartoonist who drew for what was then the aggressively
Republican Harper's Magazine. Nast was a true innovator: He abandoned the
heavy allegories of earlier styles and devoted himself to grotesque
caricature, especially of Democratic fixer Boss Tweed.

The nasties ridicule the style of the alties because it relies on text and
a narrative line, rather than drawing, caricature and allegory, to tell
its story -- a no-no among some of the crosshatching traditionalists.

The fight has raged on the cartoonists' on-line discussion groups, and at
their annual gathering in Philadelphia this May, it became an outrageous
debate between Ted Rall and Kelley of the Times-Picayune, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning "nastie."

"It's not just about the hatching," Rall says from his New York office (he
does not have a home paper -- none of New York's four daily papers have
editorial cartoonists -- but draws for a syndicate). "It's about styles of
presentation. There's a sameness, a stylistic stranglehold that exists in
cartooning. I think it's important to have a unique style, while the
industry values a style that looks like everyone else's. I've had editors
say to me that they can't take my work because it doesn't look like an
editorial cartoon. What does that mean?"

Even diehard hatchers acknowledge that a homogeneity has overtaken the
industry. The syndicated American cartoonist Daryl Cagle, who compiles a
daily index of his country's cartoons for the on-line magazine Slate,
often draws attention to what he calls "Yahtzees" -- more than five
cartoons in a day containing exactly the same image or joke.

The death of Bob Hope last week was a grand-mal Yahtzee. Cagle assembled
scores of cartoons that featured the comedian entertaining the troops in
heaven, and a dozen more showing abandoned microphones.

"The big story in editorial cartooning is the McDonald's-ization of
cartoons," he said. "We are witnessing the death of the profession of
American cartooning. A lot of papers are dropping their staff cartoonists.

"The problem with diversity in editorial cartoons is syndication -- the
papers like to see cartoons that fit into a [square] box without too many
words."

The lack of diversity is often staggering -- and it seems to be
accompanied by a lack of political diversity (and, according to
cartoonists, the lack of a single black American cartoonist). While Cagle
says that almost all cartoonists are moderate liberals, they become deeply
conservative on American military matters. The death of Uday and Qusay
Hussein last month provoked dozens of cartoons showing the brothers
burning in hell, creating a fascinating synergy between the usually
divergent styles of American and Middle-Eastern cartoonists.

Kelley of the Times-Picayune bristles at the accusation that he's an
old-schooler. He, along with many other North American cartoonists,
embraced a new style in the sixties and seventies, heavily influenced by
Mad magazine, that eschewed the heavy allegories of previous generations.
Gone were the giant octopuses labelled "world communism" and the doves
sitting on barbed wire. Their style was slapstick, dynamic and largely
text-free.

Kelley seems baffled by the attack from Ted Rall. "I prefer cartoons that
use fewer words," he says. "Why would someone say that I was wrong for
using symbolism? I think of 'old school' as like those sort of old guys
who were just telling people what to think."

This Welcome Message updated 24 March 2003.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
per subscriber per day.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).

Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
private or moderated.

Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

----------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
confidential.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
should include all of the required information. All other questions about
subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-----------------

3. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on the
right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.  If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's individual
posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no "subject":
set poetics digest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without the
text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with the
author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises; you can
also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text or in HTML
format with hyperlinks), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line
message with no "subject": set poetics nohtml index  --or--  set poetics
html index

*to temporarily turn off Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics nomail

*to reactivate Poetics mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this
one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time.  Your account may become
flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages but other important mail.

-----------------------

4.  To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options) go to the
right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html  You may also may
unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes your
e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system administrator. If
this happens you will not be able to send messages to Poetics or to
unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive mail from the Poetics
List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your old address, then return to
your new address and contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
to resubscribe. If you find that it is not possible to unsub using your old
address, please contact the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu> for
assistance.

--------------------------

5.  Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.

To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>

For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.

-------------------

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages

Hello Everyone,

I'm doing translations of poetry by the German "naive" poet, Ernst Herbeck
on Elsewhere:

Anyone who knows anything about Herbeck, please backchannel. What I've
learned so far is fascinating, but I would love other leads.

Thanks!

I am carrying water for Alistair Johnston's Poltroon Press here. (Alistair
not being on this list).  But here's the description of book he has done
that will be great news to people both in the poetry and the printing world
(you might say, Fine Press with the "Fine" upside down), and the cast of
participating characters is variously legendary.  Go to Poltroon Press'
website (www.poltroon.com) for both some images (e.g., a photo Raworth &
Dorn looking like peas in a pod), pricing and ordering info. This is a
period piece (seventies) right out there on an edge. With beaucoup humor,
where "beaucoup" does mean "beautiful cut."    The rest here is Alistair
speaking de livre:

Zephyrus Image is an undeservedly obscure small press from the San Francisco
Bay area of the 1970s. But, by their own choosing, they used alternative
methods of distribution from those available to small presses (bookstores,
libraries, collectors) and instead gave their works away in a mysterious yet
timely manner. Much of their work was political ephemera aimed at the powers
that were: The Nixon Whitehouse, Governor Ronald Reagan, while supporting
the Haight-Ashbury Diggers, Timothy Leary and the Black Panther Party. Their
literary works were often self-consciously well-made pamphlets by Robert
Creeley, Robert Bly, Fielding Dawson and Lucia Berlin, among others. They
also collaborate with Funk artist William T. Wiley and film-maker Stan
Brakhage. Their closest allies were Ed Dorn and Tom Raworth who brought
ideas, energy and connections to the scene. Some exceedinly fugitive pieces
by these avant-garde poets were cranked out in small editions, quite often
on a spontaeous lark. The energy and effort that went into such fanciful
pieces were contrary to the whimsy with which they were conceived and
delivered. In addition to their newspaper, BEAN NEWS, they produced
broadsides, pamphlets and toys with these two remarkable poets. As editor
and publisher Bob Callahan said of the Zephyrus Image enterprise: "No one
before or since took a printing press like they did and threw it into a hole
and created lightning." Alastair Johnston's bibliography tells the story of
this operation and documents it with historic photos and reproductions of
over 100 items that they printed.

Weapons of Exclusion

being fashionable success provides individualism within a dress code. I look
distinctive;  in  a Mao suit  Italian fabric of course is used.  I am what
everyone desires;
The Pachamama and Viracocha went to war and tore each other’s bodies
bleeding ice water.   Upscale goods make  you a part of the cognoscenti,
symbolic and cultural value like ear plugs and lip rings separates me from
the proles.  Tears burn open a hole in the Earth—  humanity, like a frozen
bag of plasma is ready for the butcher’s table.

the main feature of post-modernity each of us plays multiple roles and has
various styles of   understanding.  The assertion of identity is a matter of
constant urgency the manufacture of  'personality' decides for us how we are
perceived. Art provides a short cut by which we enter another identity and
join a subculture that insulates us from contamination by other people.

All art is clever marketing and consumer exploitation.


Socially Pasteurized

 a platform for enunciating messages which invite the aesthetic challenge
the opaqueness of the artist’s  intentions rob the performance of much of
its subversive thrust. The Meaning of Art.  The emphasis that city life
gives to appearances concentrates attention on the artistic. This makes art
and design  a disciplinary power  it coerces the body to shape and rearrange
itself in accordance with ever-shifting social expectations.

The ability to diet, apply facial cosmetics, arrange clothes, and wear
ornamentation, are in the service of aesthetic innovations that continually
reinvent subjectivity. The docile body shows how elements of and artistic
lifestyle are fused with the  urban habits of reading fashion magazines,
engaging in body-sculpting, gym work-outs, cosmetic surgery and periodic
internments at health and fat farms –

As Christ put it, in arguing that yes, Christians should pay their taxes:
REnder unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.  Render unto God that which is God's.

This is in Matthew -- and is the basis of Augustine's two kingdoms idea which is
later found in Luther, and then is also in Marx, since Marx was raised as a
Lutheran.

I have no idea if the Islamic people separate the realm of theology and
materialism.  According to Bernard LEwis, they don't.  He says this is the
source of their problems.  I'd cite it but I lent the book to somebody.

Luther also said he'd rather be ruled by a wise Turk than a foolish Christian.

A smart Turk could make clever distinctions between the realm of heaven and
earth.  Foolish Christians close the two kingdoms, collapse them rather, and
pollute both.  It's like the modernists asking life to become art.  You pollute
both in doing that, and create tragedy and suicide -- like Rigaud saying he
would kill himself in ten years, and then doing it, making his life into a play
up until the ending, determined in advance.  A lot of marginal surrealists tried
to do that -- Artaud, Bataille, etc.  Klossowski separates them, and puts art on
paper, citing Christ's remark on two kingdoms in doing so, but changing the idea
of "render" as in to paint, or to write, and uses Carpocratian gnosticism as his
justification, but argues that we can go further by keeping the rendering to
images, as the gold standard of the voluptuous sin is returned to our carnal
master Ialdeboth.

Sufis in their laughter may be doing similar two kingdoms' things.  Go ahead and
look for God, but tie your camel up first.

There are two systems of currency, is what Christ is saying in Matthew.  In one,
you return the coinage to Caesar in the realm of material reality.  In the
other, you return your soul, stamped in the likeness of God, to heaven.  Some
modernists tried to solder the two kingdoms together, but they went completely
mad and either ended up like Stalin or Mao, or committed suicide like Rigaud and
Artaud.  Hence, dualism of monetary systems -- carnal and spiritual -- as crazy
as it seems -- is actually more sane in the long run.

Geoffrey, could you explain what was cute at greater length?  Matt's message on
Arabic vs. Roman money, Christ's message, Klossowski's message, Luther's
ideas??  -- Kirby

perfect time in the face of Pres. Bushs hate speak

California law bans  gender identity bias
Ahmar Mustikhan,
  Gay.com/PlanetOut.com Network
Monday, August 4, 2003 / 04:46 PM



Embattled California Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill on Saturday to
outlaw bias on the basis of gender identity and expression, revising
the state's Fair Employment and Housing Act.

The bill, introduced by openly gay Assemblyman Mark Leno, D-San
Francisco, was sponsored by Equality California and formally supported
by more that 50 other local, state and national organizations.

"Every day, I am contacted by transgender people who have lost their
jobs or their homes, simply because of who they are. It is long past
time that California and other states put an end to this devastating
and costly discrimination," said Chris Daley, an attorney with the
California-based Transgender Law Center.

The amended California law describes discrimination based on sex as
including discrimination based on gender, which includes a person's
"identity, appearance or behavior whether or not that identity,
appearance or behavior is different from that traditionally associated
with the person's sex at birth."

"By enacting AB 196 into law, Californians are sending a powerful
message that no person can be denied employment or housing based on
gender-related characteristics," said Shannon Minter, legal director
for the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR).

The National Transgender Advocacy Coalition (NTAC) said it was
"overjoyed" with Davis' signature, as it thought the prospects for
enactment seemed less optimistic given the political environment, where
Davis is faced with a recall vote amid the state's economic woes.

"The governor exhibited clarity under pressure," said Vanessa Edwards
Foster, chair of NTAC. "We only wish more of our political leaders
could show as much leadership."

An ebullient Gwen Smith, founder of Remembering Our Dead, a Web site
devoted to transgender victims of murder, said, "I am amazed -- and
pleased -- that Gov. Davis chose to sign this bill, even in the midst
of mounting attacks."

California became the fourth state to ban discrimination against
transgender employees and tenants. The three other states that have
enacted laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity
and expression are Minnesota, Rhode Island and New Mexico.

Hi all,

Today's the 12th anniversary of the birth of Boog. I've posted an old story
on my blog about the first two days of the press, as well as my review of
Seabiscuit, and information on the Boog City reading in Oakland next month,
and a whole bunch of other fun stuff.

check it out:

http://boogcity.blogspot.com/

hope all is well.

as ever,
david

Thanks, Maria, for posting. It's amazing when so much Imperial/colonial news
is relatively easily available, that public outrage combined with an
aggressive media is still so minimal. (By the way the documentary on the
Weather Underground I found to be terrific - and it does all kinds of issues
as to what is effective militancy, public leadership from the left - plus
the image of a young Fred Hampton giving a speech in Chicago before he was
assassinated by the police in his bed is incredibly sad - memories of Marvin
Gaye forever moving- was the line "Freddy's dead" ).

Here's a haiku truncation of an article in the morning NY Times where an
American contractor was killed in Iraq:

Cheney's former company already has garnered more than $600 million in
military work related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and potentially
could earn billions more without having to compete with other companies.

Under a 10-year contract signed in 2001, Kellogg Brown & Root is the Army's
sole provider of troop support services -- a deal that has led to work
orders so far totaling $529.4 million related to the two wars.

The company also was given a separate, no-bid contract worth $71.3 million
to repair and operate oil wells in Iraq.

The doling out of the work orders has prompted criticism from some Democrats
in Congress that Cheney's former company is receiving favored treatment

___

Oh well, as in Oil W...

Stephen V

>
> "It's not just about the hatching," Rall says from his New York office (he

>

>
> 1. About the Poetics List
>
> With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by Charles
> Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its third incarnation, the list carries
> about 1000 subscribers worldwide, though all of these subscribers do not
> necessarily receive messages at any given time. A good number of other
> people read the Poetics List via our web archives (see web-address above).
>
> Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry that
> are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
> and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to
> the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable,
> and impossible.  We recognize that other lists may sponsor other
> possibilities for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
> participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused nature
> of this project, and respect our decision to operate a moderated list. For
> subscription information or to contact the moderators, write to
> <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
>
> This is a private list and information about this list should not be posted
> to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep the list
> membership to those with specific rather than general interests, and also
> to keep the scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.
> The current limits of the list are 50 messages per day, and two messages
> per subscriber per day.
>
> The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the high number of
> subscribers, we no longer maintain the open format with which the list
> began (at under 100 subscribers). The specific form of moderation that we
> employ is a relatively fluid one: in most cases, messages are reviewed
> after having been posted to the list, and difficulties resolved on that
> basis; however, the list moderators may shift with impunity between this
> and a pre-review mode which calls for all messages to be read and approved
> before being forwarded to the list. We prefer to avoid this option, as it
> hampers the spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition
> to these options, the list moderators may place subscribers who find
> themselves unable to abide by the rules of the list under individual
> review, in which case only their messages would be received for moderators'
> approval before being forwarded to the list. We remain committed to this
> editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List (for further
> information please see section 6 of this Welcome Message).
>
> Those few individuals who are no longer welcome to post on this list have
> forfeited that right because of their refusal to abide by list policies as
> stated in this Welcome message. While we adhere to a practice of not
> discussing particular cases on the list, the areas of our greatest concern
> include flaming of other list subscribers, including the list owners,
> and/or giving us false registration information. Please note some
> individuals have publicized false accounts of the policies of the Poetics
> List. We have deemed it unwise to respond directly to the flames of the
> list, preferring simply to note here that the Poetics List exists to
> support and encourage divergent points of view on Modern and contemporary
> poetry and poetics. We are committed to do what is necessary to preserve
> this space for such dialog. For this reason, the list has always been
> private or moderated.
>
> Further information on posting to the list for subscribers, publishers and
> series-coordinators, see sections 5 and 6.
>
> In addition to being archived at through the EPC (http://epc.buffalo.edu)
> and at http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts
> to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
> also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry
> events and publications are always welcome; we also encourage posts that
> announce events important to our subscribers. See section 5 for details.

>
> 2. Subscriptions
>
> Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
> registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe you provide your
> full name, street address, email address, and telephone number. All posts
> to the list should provide your full real name, as registered. If there is
> any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in the "from" line of
> the message header, please sign your post at the bottom.  PLEASE NOTE: All
> subscription-related information and correspondence remains absolutely
> confidential.
>
> To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators at the
> lists' administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message
> should include all of the required information. All other questions about
> subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription or subscription
> policy, should be addressed to this same administrative address.
>
> PLEASE NOTE: IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROCESS SUBSCRIPTION REQUESTS.
>
> The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
> system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may
> get bounced. Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us.
> If the problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increased
> quota from your system administrator.  You might also consider obtaining a
> commercial account. In general, if a good number of Poetics messages are
> bounced from your account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
> suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by contacting
> the moderators at<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

>
> 5.  Posting to the List
>
> The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
> moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
> Welcome Message (see section 1).
>
> Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
> poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political activism,
> film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel free to query the
> list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether a message is
> appropriate. All correspondence with the moderators regarding submissions
> to the list remains confidential and should be directed to us at
> <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
>
> We strongly encourage subscribers to post information on publications and
> reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
> they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this list.
> Brief reviews of poetry events and publications are always welcome.
>
> To post to the Poetics List, send your messages directly
> to the list address: <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>
>
> Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list to our
> administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
>
> For further information on posting to the list, see section 6 below.
>
> -------------------
>
> 6. Cautions
>
> "Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In this
> category are included messages gratuitously attacking fellow listees or the
> list owners, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or cause the list
> to reach its daily limit. These messages are considered offensive and
> detrimental to list discussion. Offending subscribers will be placed on
> temporary review (see section 1). Repeat offenders will be removed from the
> list immediately. Please do not put this policy to test.
>
> For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudononymous
> subscriptions.  We also discourage the sending of HTML-formatted messages
> to the list. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be sent in
> Text-Only format.
>
> Please also do not send attachments or include extremely long documents
> (1,000+ words) in a post.  Messages containing attachments will be presumed
> to be worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.
>
> Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of the
> author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright for all
> material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from this list
> and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
> beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use" of published materials.
>
> As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 2 messages per day from
> any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable list
> (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 50 or
> fewer messages per day.
>
> Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel your
> message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day to see if
> it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message is not posted
> there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may wish to contact the
> moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

>
> Zephyrus Image is an undeservedly obscure small press from the San Francisco
> Bay area of the 1970s. But, by their own choosing, they used alternative
> methods of distribution from those available to small presses (bookstores,
> libraries, collectors) and instead gave their works away in a mysterious yet
> timely manner. Much of their work was political ephemera aimed at the powers
> that were: The Nixon Whitehouse, Governor Ronald Reagan, while supporting
> the Haight-Ashbury Diggers, Timothy Leary and the Black Panther Party. Their
> literary works were often self-consciously well-made pamphlets by Robert
> Creeley, Robert Bly, Fielding Dawson and Lucia Berlin, among others. They
> also collaborate with Funk artist William T. Wiley and film-maker Stan
> Brakhage. Their closest allies were Ed Dorn and Tom Raworth who brought
> ideas, energy and connections to the scene. Some exceedinly fugitive pieces
> by these avant-garde poets were cranked out in small editions, quite often
> on a spontaeous lark. The energy and effort that went into such fanciful
> pieces were contrary to the whimsy with which they were conceived and
> delivered. In addition to their newspaper, BEAN NEWS, they produced
> broadsides, pamphlets and toys with these two remarkable poets. As editor
> and publisher Bob Callahan said of the Zephyrus Image enterprise: "No one
> before or since took a printing press like they did and threw it into a hole
> and created lightning." Alastair Johnston's bibliography tells the story of
> this operation and documents it with historic photos and reproductions of
> over 100 items that they printed.

James Sanders, whose poem "Poem with Erik Estrada
Autograph" appears in the most recent issue of my
fabulous journal, __The Canary__, is a lawyer.  I

<< I have no idea if the Islamic people separate the realm of theology and
materialism. >>

The Quran limits interest percentage on borrowing, so evidently Islamists do
mix theology and materialism.  This play out interestingly on the ground;
Christian arabs have no such limitations, so they run the banking end of
society; Islamic banks only attract those whose loyalties don't search out
the best financial deals.  Ie., I know that in Jordan, for example, there
has always been considerable vying for power between the (Isalmic) King, and
the (Christian) head of the Arab Bank, the largest banking establishment in
the Middle East.  The head of the bank essentially controls the economy, and
the king, the gov't's over-all policy; they're often at loggerheads.

As Christ put it, in arguing that yes, Christians should pay their taxes:
REnder unto Caesar that which is Caesar's.  Render unto God that which is
God's.

This is in Matthew -- and is the basis of Augustine's two kingdoms idea
which is
later found in Luther, and then is also in Marx, since Marx was raised as a
Lutheran.

I have no idea if the Islamic people separate the realm of theology and
materialism.  According to Bernard LEwis, they don't.  He says this is the
source of their problems.  I'd cite it but I lent the book to somebody.

Luther also said he'd rather be ruled by a wise Turk than a foolish
Christian.

A smart Turk could make clever distinctions between the realm of heaven and
earth.  Foolish Christians close the two kingdoms, collapse them rather, and
pollute both.  It's like the modernists asking life to become art.  You
pollute
both in doing that, and create tragedy and suicide -- like Rigaud saying he
would kill himself in ten years, and then doing it, making his life into a
play
up until the ending, determined in advance.  A lot of marginal surrealists
tried
to do that -- Artaud, Bataille, etc.  Klossowski separates them, and puts
art on
paper, citing Christ's remark on two kingdoms in doing so, but changing the
idea
of "render" as in to paint, or to write, and uses Carpocratian gnosticism as
his
justification, but argues that we can go further by keeping the rendering to
images, as the gold standard of the voluptuous sin is returned to our carnal
master Ialdeboth.

Sufis in their laughter may be doing similar two kingdoms' things.  Go ahead
and
look for God, but tie your camel up first.

There are two systems of currency, is what Christ is saying in Matthew.  In
one,
you return the coinage to Caesar in the realm of material reality.  In the
other, you return your soul, stamped in the likeness of God, to heaven.
Some
modernists tried to solder the two kingdoms together, but they went
completely
mad and either ended up like Stalin or Mao, or committed suicide like Rigaud
and
Artaud.  Hence, dualism of monetary systems -- carnal and spiritual -- as
crazy
as it seems -- is actually more sane in the long run.

Christopher Arigo
Lit Interim
Winner of the Pavement Saw Transcontinental Award
as chosen by David Bromige
ISBN 1-886350-71-x

I chose this submission because of all the brilliant competition it was
the one I most wanted others to read. Christopher Arigo, I think, most
convincingly questions aside. It is no new thought that poetry is here
to govern thought (I am thinking of machinery), to moderate its
mechanistic excesses; in short, as an evolutionary necessity, to prevent
us from thinking ourselves to death. In this light, poetry's alliance
with humor becomes more visible, for we laugh at mistakes while
rationality maintains its insistence, inflexible as a government
propagandist, that we make none---none, leastwise, that our, naturally,
unacknowledged, cupidity , won't excuse.

From the outset I felt myself in the presence of a master, one who
counted syllables without self-consciousness, who trusted in his bond
with language, in its manifest physicality, to show him the way. His
use, and disobedience, of the 8-syllable line, that warrant of
stability, has us speak volumes, breath quickening or slowing, either
way keeping us alive to the hospital setting. For words are merely that,
words without the in-form-ative sensibility directing them. Sensibility?
Imperative! For it becomes a matter of life or death, as Arigo emergency
ward setting from the outset reminds us-- an alert echoing throughout
the book.

I admire this book for many of its attributes: its sense of form, its
sense of humor (though the reader will find no belly laughs), the
exacting location of its poetic I (masterful while unobtrusive), and for
its unremitting mindfulness that a culture in crisis allows it to live,
that a condition as far from chaos as facism is from maypole dancing,
affords its poet his one opportunity-- notwithstanding the stifling
opportunism of the day. Our culture is held here, this poetry blooms
like a beautiful mold that is fed it but could not be predicted by it.
As Arigo writes at the end of "Nocturnal Studies"," Sleep ruptures here
and the very darkness/ you fear may redeem you." This is how I feel
about this book, this Lit(erary) Interim. Congratulations to its maker!


--David Bromige


A dense new apocalypse of vivid, relentless images, Christopher Arigo's
debut
volume is yet rich and somehow hopeful.  Inventing enthnographies,
drawing on
Da Vinci's flying machines, and generally re-mixing history, these poems
draw
from diverse sources to depict a world in dissolution, but gorgeously
so.

-- Cole Swensen



Christopher Arigo is an investigative poet, and his method is an
unprecedented
visionary forensics. Every one of these poems comprises a scene of
shocking
dispossession which, by virtue of Arigo's method, becomes serene,
sometimes
even sublime. We find ourselves in a very new place indeed-- "The
interim
between having/and trees swept by wind."

Sofia Starnes
A Commerce of Moments
Paper Trade: ISBN 1-886350-68-X

Editor’s Choice for the Transcontinental Poetry Award for an outstanding
first book-length collection of poetry or prose.

Couplet by couplet, Sofia Starnes leads her readers on a poetic quest
for understanding.  Her perfect pitch and her acute sensitivity to the
pace and nuances of language are reason enough for us to follow. A
Commerce of Moments is a gathering of very special poems.

-- Billy Collins

A Commerce of Moments marks a solid debut for a poet whose craft and
elegance are obvious from the first poem. This work of awe-inspiring
clarity and purity of language is from a poet whose wide-awake eyes
allow us to experience a vivid, lasting world. Blessed is a poet so
connected to what is most essential to this life, and perhaps the next
too. This book will enchant; a fine collection indeed.

--Virgil Suarez

Starnes possesses a fine tuned ear. This collection is so good reading
one of these poems aloud relaxes your mouth.

Shadows of Innocence


Purewhite, paperwhites,
odor of petals on the wicker-stand on which

we lean.
Deathwhite, dogwood white, hybrid

shadows behind the screened porch...
We have been cautioned not

to invade the white square off the house,
where the dead live.

  Why did you bring the bulbs
indoors this year?   Fresh spring-

whites are for old slabs with their prone angels.
Remember the dotted hearts in our earliest

missals, their venial lesson, scent
of onion skin.  We learned

from them never to flirt with a fragrance,
for the sake of our faithfulness.

  Blameless lily-white,
how it escapes us, as white always does,

with the merest gesture:  a finger
smudge on the slick envelope, thin trickle

on the swab where a nail
ripped, velvet eye-shade against the tissue,

powdery death.
Remember the white cassock our priest wore

in summer heat, like a returning santo?
  It dropped its length on stubby

feet, into our muddy garden.


-------

Flores de Mayo

    Venid y vamos todos con flores a María,
    con flores a porfía, que madre nuestra es.
               (from a processional hymn)

May in absentia, magenta
in our grip; we cannot give a scent-by-scent

account, born-again children of that long-gone,
long-withered month.

  Pink cellophane hour
of caladium leaves, straw-gold everlastings,

our thin exuding birds of paradise: disquiet
of an orange nib, the wilt and non-

wilt of its pair,
dependent on the day of month,

how sticky or how stupefied our hands.
All in that first forelived desire to be in love —

  Children will always fret in starch,
and we, no less, ran out of chapel

for the patintero chalk lines:  this,
our tumult, and that yours, border patrols

with arms wide.
Beneath our bursts, ants crawled out in anger.

I stepped on one small mound,
was fired upon a thousand times, poppy-red

around the ankles.  Such
is the price of love and of invasion,

price of foreplay.   Don’t you see?
  We exercise pursuit again, again,

whether in cotton eyelet, threadwork of old
thread hemming, or tightest thigh-sewn

jeans, clunky shoes or stilettos —
we pray-play for acceptance with eyes borrowing

an old omniscient spring.
  In spite of everything we’ve

known and tried, how a Beloving lures us;
out of our game, still that darling likelihood…

  Always a summer-rose
  behind the rose-face of a mother.

archaea6.exe at http://www.asondheim.org/portal/archaea6.exe

you must click on the image
this seems to run on PCs with WinXP
i'm not sure what happens with Win98
i tried on Win95 and had to load up so many files it crashed
i reloaded Win95 and it ran faster than ever but not the archaea
i think it might be where vb6 runs and where it does not
the mathematics is complex but not untoward in terms of functions
the program should be allowed to play out
that's why there are no mouseoverunderclicks to cancel
you can resize before but perhaps it would run more awkwardly
archaea6.exe is a lovely arbor and a curtain drawing down
the curtain d. d. is called dusk / closure or perhaps closure / dusk
it is both a time of day and a dedication to romanticist denouement
it is important that the archaea series contains no random function
it is all true calculation of the machine
this is my philosophy in the series which is a philosophy as well

of the urls pertaining to US foreign policy -- also one of the most
credible of the avowedly anti-war right-wing websites)
http://www.truthout.org (stories exclusively from mainstream media -- for
this reason, a very interesting website)
http://www.commondreams.org/ (this compilation website is subtitled
"breaking news and views for the progressive community")
http://www.buzzflash.com/ (very earnest and sometimes annoying abstracts
but generally the most sedulously updated website I frequent)
http://www.legitgov.org/ (sometimes *very* annoying abstracts, but useful site)
http://www1.iraqwar.ru/?userlang=en (a Russian website rumored to be
maintained by Russian intelligence. During the major combat in Iraq, this
webste provided reports based on US-UK military radio communications.
Sometimes carries and duplicates journalist pieces from western sources.
Also interesting in that it provides reader-feedback sections. This
feedback is often very caustic in its criticisms of the US invasion of Iraq
and of US policy toward Israel and its occupation of Palestine.)
www.indymedia.org (Independent media source, cooperative. Broke the story,
eg, with photographs, of how staged the toppling of the Saddam statue after
the "liberation")
http://www.newamericancentury.org/ (this policy website is run by the
Project for the New American Century, a "neo-con" organization with strong
political and business and policy ties to the Bush administration. If you
want to know what the administration is thinking or where it's going, this
is a good place to start.)
www.onpower.org (a compendium of articles and bibliographic material about
how US foreign market and military interests have been advanced by the
advent and creation of national "crises" -- more of a thinktank website
than a news source, but topical and germane)
http://www.aljazeerah.info/ (an online English version of Al Jazeera, the
news source out of Qatar, which has won several prestigious international
awards for its journalism [eg, a recent "anti-censorship award" called the
"Freedom of Expression Award" given by the London-based Index on
Censorship]. Of itself it says, "Your Gateway to Understanding the world
system, American Foreign Policy, and the Arab and Muslim Worlds ..."  Very
interesting source.)
http://ap.tbo.com/ap/breaking/index.htm (Associated Press breaking news.
Some of these stories are later picked up by newspapers and are then
altered by those newspapers. Sometimes it's interesting to note how
newspapers alter the stories. For instance, just a few days ago the New
York Times removed some statistics from an online story about how many US
soldiers have been wounded in Iraq since the US invaded the country)

--"That there are men in all countries who get their living by war, and by
keeping up the quarrels of nations, is as shocking as it is true; but when
those who are concerned in the government of a country, make it their study
to sow discord, and cultivate prejudices between nations, it becomes the
more unpardonable."

Mosques, at least those in Turkey, often devote the first floor to retail
stores and service outlets. The largest mosque in Ankara, Kocateppe Cami,
has a mall in the basement.

It=92s not really my place to advertise since I am just a regular =

The URL is: http://www.poetics.yorku.ca

Now, on the NACIP site, you=92ll find this, erm, interesting take on the
Ursonate from Geoffrey Hlibchuk:
http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~hlibchuk/esonata1.mp3

I don't really see the point myself, though I did get a kick out of
trying to listen for f=FCmms b=F6=F6 w=F6=F6 t=E4=E4 z=E4=E4 uuu etc. It =
might have been
more interesting to have fed the ursonate through whatever that program
was that Paul Lansky used for Small Talk for an unusual take..

Mime-version: 1.0

Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I'm reordering, below, entries from my blog
[http://www.pantaloons.blogspot.com] that went up yesterday. Appreciate your
ideas either backchannel or on the list. Thanks.

~~

I'm taking notes on the interconnection of empiricism, epistemology and..
and.. and macrotheory with regards to.. to poetry? Any thoughts about the
empiricism end??

How would empiricism enter a discussion of a poem, a set of poems, oeuvres??

Interested less in thinking of empiricism at the level of its 'equal
footing' with theory, epistemology. Rather, how can empirical data confirm
or conflate what we know or hypothesize. And what are empirical data? Text
components? Or more, the semantic components and experiences they imply??

I'm wanting to learn about how poetry can be viewed as data _of_ and _for_
inquiry. My colleague and teacher Israel Scheffler says, "Knowing is not a
strategy of inquiry any more than curing a strategy of treatment." Theory, a
system of generalized knowing or knowledge, may not be the primary entry for
this line of questioning.

Hey, I just moved to SF (and I miss my local lake in Oakland which I walked
around a lot, and also some walking partners I had, like Stephanie Young or,
before that, Lisa Sperber)

And I tend to ride my bike over to Golden Gate Park (when it's not too
windy) and ride around the "polo" track. Would love if somebody's into it...

Or if somebody just wants to go for habitual hour long evening walk talks
around the mission (i like to walk relatively fast)....

(okay, i'll stop before i get into the---preferably single female, etc.
etc....)....

Scott -- this is a perfect illustration of what Kenneth Burke calls "perspective
through incongruity" -- the theological directly on top of the secular.

Ezra Pound's fanaticism against usury seems to me to have come from St. Francis
and St. Thomas -- who outlawed this.  This Italian Catholic idea resulted in
only the Jews being able to practice usury, so it's why we have The Merchant of
Venice as a Jew, and yet in Arabic countries the laws provide a loophole for
Christians.  I didn't know this, and find it amusing.

Bill Marsh, I forwarded this to the list, because it seems right on the
money.  I should have been more careful about the porno thing.  I don't
believe there were any porno publishers in 1519 in Wittenberg, Germany,
or anywhere else in Europe, but I could be wrong.  Durer and Cranach
were living in Wittenberg, however, and painting nudes based on Roman
and Greek mythological settings for their aristocratic patrons.  Luther
was friends with these painters, and never said a word about it.  He did
say that the artists were free to do what they liked, and that this had
nothing to do with theology. Luther often made incredible jests about
his wife's anatomy (which he adored) while eating in public.

Lutheran colleges, which Gloria suggests as model, are not very Lutheran
in this regard.  That is, Luther said they were free to do what they
liked.  There is no Lutheran mathematics, or Lutheran science.  Nor is
there any such thing as Lutheran arts insofar as I am aware.  And even
if there were, there is no such thing as a Lutheran college, although 42
of them do get some pitiful amount of money from their local synods.
However, they are now entirely ecumenical.  Valparaiso has at least two
atheists in their theology department.  The English department at Wagner
has two Muslims.  Muhlenberg College is at least half Jewish.
Susquehanna is almost completely secular in its orientation.  Perhaps
some of the smaller Missouri Synod colleges such as Concordia do
discriminate against non-Lutherans in terms of employment and
admissions, but so far as I have been able to determine, Lutheran
colleges are almost anything but Lutheran, even if some Lutherans of
families that have made it do still tend to go to places like St. Olaf's
in Minnesota.

I'm somewhat outside of this, though, so I could be wrong.  I doubt that
art professors are largely church-goers at Lutheran colleges.  I should
do a survey.

Marx is constantly citing Luther through Capital.  He probably cites him
more than anybody else.  But again, this is because he was from a
largely Lutheran area of Germany, and may have wanted to convince some
through his citations.  How close was Marx to Luther in terms of having
the sense that art was a question of freedom?  I can't find Marx ever
arguing that an artist should be censored for their viewpoint.  Why
Marxists do this has to be a matter of local theological conditions
prevailing at the time, but I can't prove this.  These issues are
puzzling, and if you go deep enough, generally give rise to a comic
perspective.  Still, I really enjoyed your Lutheran pastor's ideas as
they are put forward here.  I can't find any Lutheran pastors who know
much about this area, so your pastor must be very erudite to have
tracked down this much info while not even having it as a speciality.
Thanks zillions!  I wish I could find a panel of Lutherans somewhere who
have addressed the issues of aesthetics, and perhaps especially a
Lutheran who can compare and contrast the Lutheran iconographic
tradition with the Marxist.  What follows is your pastor's response, in
case there's some nut out there like me whose eyes haven't glazed over.

Jean Cocteau likes grapes. Likes
the thought of grapes, their
form in his mind somehow
congruent with

salves, or the slavish
poetics he tallies: sacs;


blooming along the trellis
in leprous overabundance.
There are no grapes in Northeast
Ohio, at least not

last night, when walking the length
of Cooper Foster Park Road,
Sheffield to Lorain, I
saw a deer staring through live

mists of an empty field. It was
right across the street from where

my father's buried. A road there

can veer off into these stoned histories, and Jean
can't.

Certainly not indicative of the Muslim world I have experienced. Never saw

But, I complained, it is too small to say and wide. God took a pinch of
snuff, Feeble excuse, He pronounced. I sniffed too, in a victimised style. I
wanted to ask: what's wrong with self-pity? I have pity for others too, but
He had levitated away already, safe in the clouds, and I was left with:

enfin the teeth fall out, enfin the prophet never appears, enfin the bus
breaks down, enfin I am a prat, enfin there is little unmarked on the maps
bar a lane not far from Market Harborough where delectable wild mushrooms
grow which has no relevance to anything, enfin simile is like a blind eye
opening, notice the singular, enfin memory is a black hole, guzzling at what
is, enfin we are what escapes us, leaking into the undefined, the burden of
void, carry that round with me I do. The ultimate hole. The home of lost
cries, of

slurp. Enfin.

Dear Stephen,

Thanks for passing this on to the list, as I share in your appreciation =
of the history of this lively small press.  Teter and Myers had little =
interest in galleries or special collections, and most of their work (I =
gather) was distributed on the streets or sent off to friends, etc. so =
their materials are scattered, if not verging on extinction (the cover =
image with the "Help you local junkie" broadside tattered against a =
telephone pole seems to say it all).=20

The collection here in Buffalo, for example, owns only about a dozen =
titles.  This makes the bibliography all the more important, as are its =
illuminating swatches on Dorn or Raworth.  I would also mention that =
this is the third bibliography Johnston has authored on the intersection =
of the book arts/poetry press scene following WWII, beginning with the =
Auerhahn Press and Dave Hazelwood Books, followed by White Rabbit (also =
from Poltroon). =20

Also, Johnston has contributed to the Cento feature on Dorn at: =
http://www.centomag.org/

Cheers,

Kyle

I am carrying water for Alistair Johnston's Poltroon Press here. =
(Alistair
not being on this list).  But here's the description of book he has done
that will be great news to people both in the poetry and the printing =
world
(you might say, Fine Press with the "Fine" upside down), and the cast of
participating characters is variously legendary.  Go to Poltroon Press'
website (www.poltroon.com) for both some images (e.g., a photo Raworth &
Dorn looking like peas in a pod), pricing and ordering info. This is a
period piece (seventies) right out there on an edge. With beaucoup =
humor,
where "beaucoup" does mean "beautiful cut."    The rest here is Alistair
speaking de livre:

Zephyrus Image is an undeservedly obscure small press from the San =
Francisco
Bay area of the 1970s. But, by their own choosing, they used alternative
methods of distribution from those available to small presses =
(bookstores,
libraries, collectors) and instead gave their works away in a mysterious =
yet
timely manner. Much of their work was political ephemera aimed at the =
powers
that were: The Nixon Whitehouse, Governor Ronald Reagan, while =
supporting
the Haight-Ashbury Diggers, Timothy Leary and the Black Panther Party. =
Their
literary works were often self-consciously well-made pamphlets by Robert
Creeley, Robert Bly, Fielding Dawson and Lucia Berlin, among others. =
They
also collaborate with Funk artist William T. Wiley and film-maker Stan
Brakhage. Their closest allies were Ed Dorn and Tom Raworth who brought
ideas, energy and connections to the scene. Some exceedinly fugitive =
pieces
by these avant-garde poets were cranked out in small editions, quite =
often
on a spontaeous lark. The energy and effort that went into such fanciful
pieces were contrary to the whimsy with which they were conceived and
delivered. In addition to their newspaper, BEAN NEWS, they produced
broadsides, pamphlets and toys with these two remarkable poets. As =
editor
and publisher Bob Callahan said of the Zephyrus Image enterprise: "No =
one
before or since took a printing press like they did and threw it into a =
hole
and created lightning." Alastair Johnston's bibliography tells the story =
of
this operation and documents it with historic photos and reproductions =
of
over 100 items that they printed.

The FLYING SAUCER CAFE reading/media series is starting again!


TUESDAY, AUGUST 12, 7:00, At the FLYING SAUCER CAFE in BROOKLYN -

AYA KARPINSKA and TIM PETERSON

(See below for details)


***


AYA KARPINSKA


Aya Karpinska's research and creative work focus on the impact of
technology on artistic practice, in particular computer-mediated music
and literature. Her diverse output includes computer music, fiction,
poetry, web and graphic design, and game design. She recently performed
at Tonic in New York City with her electronic music instrument, container
for sound.

Ms. Karpinska received her Master's degree from the Interactive
Telecommunications Program at New York University.

http://www.technekai.com/aya/

notes for container for sound
A box containing sounds waiting to be released. The performer unleashes
the composition by opening doors, flapping them like wings to manipulate
sound samples. This electronic instrument was built to explore new
interfaces for musical expression. Although it was designed to be simple
to play, the performer's physical gestures translate into a wide musical
palette.

More information on the development of this instrument can be found at:
http://www.technekai.com/aya/nime/


TIM PETERSON


Tim Peterson currently lives in Somerville, Massachusetts. He attended
Wesleyan University where he majored in art history and then went on to
get his MFA at The University of Arizona. He currently works at M.I.T.
Press.  This is Tim's first poetry reading in New York, and to mark this
event Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs published his debut chapbook titled
CUMULUS.

The Flying Saucer Cafe series pares up new media artists with poets who
instead of giving a reading present a talk relating to their poetry and
ideas.

Tim's talk is titled "Spontaneous Generation." It focuses on writing a
gender by writing a world, and it also deals with issues of private
language, the dialogic, and spatial metonymy: issues concerning Peterson's
identity and his writing process. He says of this, "the two poles of
understanding are on the one hand the urge "to be some body," an ideal
self enforced by society, and on the other hand the limiting specificity
of the question: whose body? in what situation?"

THE FLYING SAUCER READING/MEDIA SERIES


We will be having readings the first Tuesday of each month (August an
exception). Please come and support us!

Contact Brenda Iijima or Alan Sondheim for further information.
 Brenda Iijima <yoyolabs@hotmail.com>
 Alan Sondheim (sondheim@panix.com)

The Flying Saucer is located at 494 Atlantic Ave. between Nevins and 3rd
Avenues, in Brooklyn. You can subways to the Pacific or Atlantic stops,
including the 2, 3, 4, 5, W, N, R, Q, and anything else that runs there.

Telephone at the Flying Saucer Cafe is 718-522-1383.

heron and egret

here in kingston, a great blue heron has injured its left foot; it appears
broken.

we went to the fire station.
we called wnep-tv which covers wildlife.
we called the audubon society in harrisburg, 150 miles away; there is no
local audubon society.
we called a local emergency animal clinic.
we called a nearby animal hospital.
we called the pennsylvania game and wildlife commission.

we spoke to people and left messages. there is a chance the bird will
be rescued.

just before, a great white egret, majestic. this bird has also come north.
it was skittish, but flew gracefully.

images of both, documenting the faunal arrivals.

In the essay 'On Speaking Verse,' Paul Val=E9ry relates the text of a =
poem
as analogous to the score of a piece of music:

        "A poem, like a piece of music, offers merely a text, which,
        strictly speaking, is only a kind of recipe; the cook who
        follows it plays an essential part. To speak of a poem in
        itself, to judge of a poem in itself, has no real or precise
        meaning. It is to speak of a potentiality. The poem is an
        abstraction, a piece of writing that stands waiting, a law
        that lives only in some human mouth, and that mouth is
        simply a mouth."

Is this what you mean George?

I thought that the Quaran *forbade* interest payments. I think this because
in the UK, the main banks are now offering mortgages which comply with this
belief to UK islamists - see
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3035292.stm

I can see, though, where zealots might pare a "little" to "nothing".

BTW, French law used to forbid "usury" (see
http://articles.corporate.findlaw.com/articles/00304/008493.html wherein
French law is aligned with EU codiciles). I think that this criminalisation
of usury has something to do with anti-Jewish sentiment - see
http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=231&letter=S - although
I'm not confident about this claim.

Haiku

Upon Kissing You after You Vomited.
Upon Walking You Home and You Pissing
in Your Pants. Upon Asking a Complete Stranger
about Our Situation. Upon Reading Issa's
Prescripts "Issa in a State of Illness"
"At Being Bewildered on Waking" and Realizing
the Haiku Poets Were Not So Laconic and How
Could They Be? Poem Before Dying. Poem
Shortly Before I Head to Dinner. Poem in Which
I Enter Drops of Dew Like a Man with Tiny Keys.
Hitomaro has a poem called On Seeing
the Body of a Man Lying among the Stones
on the Island of Samine in Sanuki Province.
Kanyu's short poem is called A Poem
Shown to My Niece Sonsho on Reaching
the Barrier of the Ran after Being Relegated
to an Inferior Position. Poem Louis Aragon
Would Be Proud Of. Poem I'll Never Show You.
Poem Written in a Bugs Bunny Cartoon as the
Plane's Controls Come Off in My Hands. Poem
that Jerks Around Like a Hamster in a Bag. Basho
wrote a haiku for his students that he claimed
was his death poem. The night before
he said that for the last 20 years every poem
he had written had been his death poem. Upon
No Longer Recalling My Thoughts When I Was a Boy
Within My Father's Stare. At Being Exhausted
at Having to Explain Why Using Slang
Is More Fun than Reading a Dictionary of Slang.
The poet Saikaku once wrote 23,500 verses
in 24 hours. Basho saw Mt. Nikko and said,
"I was filled with such awe that I hesitated
to write a poem." Upon Looking Past You
into the Mattress, into the Faces of Prior Lovers.
Upon Trying to Cultivate My Inner Life While
Also Killing My Ego. On Watching
a 200 pd. Endangered Orangutan
Rape My Wife While She Shouts at Me
Not to Shoot Him. On Seeing a Blood-Shot
Spanish Boy Who Was Not Even Crying He Was So Sad
And Not Even Crying He Was So Sad. Poem
in Which I Embody a Moment So Vividly, So
Succinctly, Yet Decorate It with Such Sills,
Such Elaborations. Upon Doodling Your Name
Which Became Your Face Emerging from Day-Old
Coals. Upon Reading that Basho Believed "A Haiku
Revealing 70 to 80% of Its Subject Is Good, Yet
Those Revealing 50 to 60% Will Never Bore Us."
On Finally Leaving My Attic and Hearing English
for the First Time in 20 Years and It Sounding
Like an Animal's Cry Before It Attacks. Poem
in Response to Flying all the Way to Rome
to Meet You and Being Dumped at the Airport.
Peom about the Next Two Weeks We Spent Together.
Poem as I Sit on this Curb with My Head
in My Hands. Poem After Learning the Japanese
Word for the Simultaneous Feeling of Love
and Hatred. Poem for the Mountain at the End
of My Street. Poem in Response to Some of My
Recent Poems that Seem to Have Been Written
Inside of an Aquarium. On Spending a Week in Silence
at a Monastery and Not Being Allowed Pen or Paper.
On Meditating and Feeling Like I Was a Blue Flame.
On Getting Up and Scribbling Something in the Bathroom.
On Stopping at the Train Tracks and Having a Deer
Break His Head Through My Passenger Window,
Stare at Me, and Then Run Back into the Wood.

History carries its properties
across borders of abstraction
into the weight of the sun
tugging shadows across

the treelawn. Anenome's once
headache thins with appointment
cancelation, tasting the lightning
deep in her teeth. This year, alone,

she broke in directions. Every charm
against the night attracts poly
morphism the same way
sleep does: shivers for fruitful gods.

there's a FANTASTIC lawyer poet in Philadelphia named Sophia Memon.
i heard her read recently at the Asian Arts Initiative with poet Mytili Jagannathan.

they were reading a collaborative piece they had written, a series of haiku on
war that they read as a conversation for us.  stunning stuff.

Sophia is participating in the live panel 9for9 coming up at the Philly Sound:  http://www.english.upenn.edu/~wh/phillysoundwknd.html
she's also giving a reading at the festival...

here's her bio from the catalog:
Sofia Memon is a poet and welfare rights lawyer who lives and works in Philadelphia, PA.
Sofia has read her work at The Khyber, the Asian Arts Initiative, both in Philadelphia, as well as
the Philly Sound Poetry Festival.  Her poetry will appear in the soon to be published anthology,
Writing the Lines of Our Hands.  Her writing is an exploration of sound, lyric, and form as well as
an expression of cultural fusion, muslim spirituality, and humane politics.

too bad that, moving, it moved.

sounds like, from title, it tied Susan's poetry (yes?) to her
criticism--wish I could read it.

my mansions cage a bit... my World Virginia... my slow down (my speed up is
free)... my verse...
my fireplace over the hypodermic gone seventeen hours large... my bed one
part photographs, three parts breakfast... my Eternal Damnation came as
quite a relief... My Lucky Dollar my way out...
my eyes & the dust I clean my sugar with... my bared skin... my sensitive
Formosa....my lying
promises.... my lucky pennies... my small wings... my who's who is in who is
(blank)'s foundation...
my right hand cut off & how many poets would then find themselves
left-handed?... my prime suspect for the theft of my starved fox ashes...
you're my night... the spiteful riddles of my tongue....
my liberty is drawing toward silence... prayers thus amazed saw each new
face in my eyes... my eyes troubled the summer with Prussian copies...
axioms conceived my heart... my ancestors read Nerval in a characteristic
phylogeny plantation... my Siren lies under other skies... my equipment is
becoming something of an American world... my good name born amongst her
imperfect gravity... my lungs eat away at the Psalmist... my common sense
tells me "readers are not witnesses"... my darling resemblance is a few
steps away... my ears thin-metal an explanation... my bed seemed so far
away... my exclamations light did rent the best a la moderation... my
dearest... my dinner reputation always cudgeled red-hot to mark the world
from what Virginia marks as literary... my skin crawls in sympathy when I
think 'pon the prowling skin of lefthand flowers... my suggestion is
licensed to do what you're so eager for... my knee beheld their eyebrows
spectacular... my works on paper suggested to me by my substitute... my
house creatures are half-built words...  threaten my own lips in return for
more time... my sight suddenly restored by beastliness... my shoes chuck out
a shade to dance a rant...
no use my counting for nothing... have I not the scent of my trembling
betters?... my blood runs
at their hitherto pierced sleeps plugged now with phrase... my hound-tooth
tearing the sky open white
as clouds... my moving part like a fox slimy with heart... my ridiculous
commitment to the silent stone inside me... my neck crowding-swept out to
the willows... you're my two broken strings & every moon that falls quiet...
my shabby tail's mechanical fruit gone All Loud Wormswork... my promise spat
between the blood forks... the forbidden suffer my tumor of birds... my
zodiac’s broken into stumps your telescope gapes... where my wanders ended
Shelley's began... I named my sled Violet...
my early contacts pulled into shape by, ah, moonfolks... my gangplank notes
considered succulent...
my shrug slips the knock-out... my snooze ceased with a sneeze...  my own
flesh left to flower...
the top of my light is already out of the frame...  souring my silver with
air relentless & desolate...
my eye swamping 1000 years for mountains between numbers & oaths... my child
is Cold Earth...
waves sack my whole as it topples Bad Cuttlefish's... my first vicinity was
a tolerably warm boot upon
a road lately removed... Medusa will use her mirrored artery to espy my
caduceus... my wooden horses...
I got my own Laura too (not Laura II)... my own Jeff Harrison...

OPERA: Poems 1981-2002

<A HREF=3D"http://meritagepress.com/opera.htm">OPERA: Poems 1981-2002, Barry=
 Schwabsky</A>=20

Meritage Press is pleased to announce the publication of OPERA, the first=20
book-length collection of poems by Barry Schwabsky.  Written over a=20
21-year-period, OPERA presents a compelling, often ecstatic, poetic body of=20=
work by a=20
writer who has been more visible over the past two decades as a respected ar=
t=20
critic. Mr. Schwabsky was first published as a college undergraduate in POET=
RY=20
magazine; subsequently, he published his work in various journals as well as=
 in=20
two chapbooks, the last being Fate/Seen In The Dark in 1985 through the=20
respected poetry publisher, Burning Deck.  Over the last decade, however, he=
 has=20
circulated his poems informally or published them only as limited-edition=20
poet-artist collaborations.  OPERA now allows Mr. Schwabsky's poetry to be a=
ccessible=20
to the larger public.

Reflecting his primarily private poetic development, Mr. Schwabsky has=20
created a poetry that transcends the schools and categories that sprung up w=
ithin=20
the poetry world of recent decades -- also observed by various poet-critics=20
offering advance words on OPERA.  David Shapiro says Mr. Schwabsky's poems a=
re=20
"born of a strange encounter between American poetry and European masters su=
ch as=20
Celan and Novalis [that] always surprises me by its exploratory=20
investigations."  John Yau says, "Imagine poems written by Sir Walter Raleig=
h after he has=20
read Wittgenstein and Lorine Neidecker, listened to bands whose names weren'=
t=20
in the air =E2=80=A6 and learned more about contemporary art than anyone tho=
ught=20
possible, and you might get a sense of the compactness of these poems, an ai=
ry=20
abstract density unlike anyone else's."  Geoffrey O'Brien, meanwhile, says,=20=
"These=20
might be choruses and arias from some lost Venetian music drama of the early=
=20
1600s =E2=80=A6 transmuted over the intervening centuries of silence into a=20=
software=20
program for a new species of lyrical electronica."

Mr. Schwabsky is a well-known art critic for such publications as Artforum=20
(where he is co-editor of international reviews), Art in America, Tema Celes=
te,=20
and the London Review of Books and the author of The Widening Circle:=20
Consequences of Modernism in Contemporary Art (Cambridge University Press) a=
s well as=20
co-author of Jessica Stockholder (Phaidon Press), Gillian Wearing: Mass=20
Observation (Merrell Publishers), and Vitamin P: New Perspectives in Paintin=
g=20
(Phaidon Press), among others.  He also works as a curator and teacher, havi=
ng=20
taught at Pratt Institute, the School of Visual Arts, New York University, Y=
ale=20
University, and Goldsmiths College, University of London.  Born in Paterson,=
 New=20
Jersey, he currently resides in London.  Inevitably, Mr. Schwabsky's=20
activities as an art critic has affected his poems as reflected in an elegan=
t=20
exactitude to his form: in his poems, each word earns its presence.=20

please circulate this as you see fit. apologies if it comes to you numerous
times.  :)

Sarah Joy Stoker and Collective Gutsink invite you to join us at Cape Spear,
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, August 8, 9, and 10 anytime between 6 and 9pm
for Knights Impro 3.
http://www.pc.gc.ca/lhn-nhs/nl/spear/index_e.asp

This is the third installment of the Knights Impro series. It is an
opportunity to experience spontaneous interdisciplinary art in its purest
form in a setting like no other, Cape Spear.

Featured local artists are Curtis and Duane Andrews, Greg Bennett, Alison
Carter, Neil Conway, Chris Driedzic, Kevin Hehir and Sarah Joy Stoker. We
are extremely excited to announce the participation of Montreal based
artists Lin Snelling and Deborah Dunn.


Deborah Dunn studied visual art before getting seduced by dance. She has
worked as a choreographer, performer, photographer, and as a set and costume
designer. She started her company Trial and Eros in Vancouver in '93 and
moved to Montreal in '98. Her choreography has toured to Burlington, New
York, Toronto, Vancouver, Regina, St. John’’s, Halifax and Calgary. Deborah
has performed with some of Canada’’s leading improvisers including: Jennifer
Mascall, Benoit Lachambre, Andrew Harwood and Peter Bingham. Her work is
both elegant and critical, heartfelt and hilarious. As a dancer she has been
described as clean and gentle with a strong yet lyrical presence.


Lin Snelling is a hybrid dance-theatre choreographer and performer.  She
continues to investigate, perform and teach improvisation which has
cultivated an exploration into body work in relation to dance and the spoken
and written word. Lin studied with Nancy Topf for three years, and still
maintains a link and deep interest in Topf technique.  Lin has performed
since 1989 with Gilles Maheu and Carbone 14 touring nationally and
internationally.  In addition, she has worked with several other
choreographers and directors in Toronto,Montreal, Vancouver, and Europe. An
interest in multidisciplinary art and invention fuels her many
choreographies, some of the most recent being Femme Comme Paysage / Woman As
Landscape with collaborators Michael Reinhart and Josée Gagnon. Words Will
Be Spoken / Echo , a collaboration with Hetty King  presented  at Tangente
and at P.S. 122 in New York, and  IAMMYOWNRAIN, an urban ritual initiated
and danced by Chantal Lamirande. Her most recent collaboration, Extinction,
is being presented in its evolutionary forms this fall at the
Vernissage-danse #104, #105, and #106 and will be premiered in Mexico in
January 2003.

This project has been funded by The Canada Council for the Arts and The
Newfoundland and Labrador Arts Council. For any further info please email

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

F.T. Prince passed away yesterday at 90. Of the various literary
conservatives who were variously adopted over the years by the NY
School, this South African born British Shakespeare & Milton specialist,
who later taught at Brandeis & in Yemen, was the most formal. I saw him
read once in NY many years ago with John Ashbery & Ann Lauterbach -- he
seemed frail even then (nearly 20 years ago).=20

Here's the obit & his most famous poem:

F T Prince
(Filed: 08/08/2003)=20


F T Prince, who died yesterday aged 90, was one of the most interesting
and underrated poets of the 20th century.

During the Second World War he worked as an Intelligence officer at
Bletchley Park and in the Middle East, and composed what came to be his
best-known poem, Soldiers Bathing, a moving meditation in rhyming
couplets on the "bitterness and pity that engage / Blood, spirit, in
this war."

It concludes with a mysteriously resonant image of sacrifice, one which
contrasts absolutely with the deft ironies of more cynical Second World
War poets such as Keith Douglas: "I feel a strange delight that fills me
full, / Strange gratitude, as if evil itself were beautiful, / And kiss
the wound in thought, while in the west / I watch a streak of red that
might have issued from Christ's breast."

Prince was a poet whose work critics found particularly difficult to
classify. His first collection, austerely entitled Poems, was published
by Faber in 1938.

It is not hard to see why this manuscript from an unknown 25-year-old
South African should have impressed Faber's then editor, T S Eliot. The
poems fuse an extraordinary literary sophistication with an elusive,
subtle lyricism and oblique, ever-shifting angles of vision.

Nothing could have been further from the political tub-thumping or
knockabout farce of the dominant English poet of the 1930s, W H Auden.
Prince explored the language of his various speakers, such as Edmund
Burke, or the Zulu prince Chaka, or an invented 17th-century artist
appealing for funds to his patron, with a disinterestedness that is
particularly astonishing given that the poems were composed on the eve
of the Second World War.

Despite this auspicious debut, Prince's next volume, Soldiers Bathing,
did not appear until 1954, and then with a different publisher (Fortune
Press). The poems collected here were again intensely literary and
self-conscious. Prince made brilliant use of the dramatic monologue
developed in the mid-19th century by Tennyson and Browning to give the
thoughts of Michelangelo in old age and of the Sybil.

Prince's retelling of this myth is one of his most successful long
poems. According to the Ancient Greek legend, the god of the sun,
Apollo, fell in love with the Sybil and agreed to grant her any wish.
She asked to live as many years as there were grains in a certain heap
of dust, but forgot to ask for enduring youth. Apollo and the Sybil
reveals with particular clarity Prince's immaculate control of sound,
rhythm, and the energies of syntax. Radiant land and seascapes are
played off the Sybil's physical decrepitude and insistent self-doubts:

And now a low brown person, shrinking slowly to a bag of skin, / I
wonder at myself, and even more that, were I to begin, // I think that I
should do what I have done. // And gulls, swallows, turn down wind, /
The sea toils, grinds and crushes / Marble to milk at cliff-base =85

Prince's poems had attracted by this time an eclectic band of fervent
admirers. This small but select fan-club included poets as dissimilar
from one another as Geoffrey Hill and John Ashbery, both of whom
contributed to a special issue of P N Review dedicated to the work of
Prince that was published last year. It was Ashbery who successfully
sponsored Prince's candidacy for the E M Forster award he received from
the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Frank Templeton Prince was born in the mining town of Kimberley, South
Africa, on September 13 1912, and educated at the Christian Brothers'
College in Kimberley. He went on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he
read English, and continued his literary studies at Princeton.

Prince was an academic scholar as well as a poet. His study of Italian
influences on Milton's poetry was published in 1954, and is still one of
the standard works on this subject.

From 1957 to 1974 Prince was a Professor of English at Southampton
University, and after his retirement he accepted a number of
professorships at a diverse array of institutions: the University of
Jamaica (1975-78); Brandeis University in America (1978-80); and Sana'a
University, North Yemen (1981-83).

Aside from his monograph on Milton, his other most significant scholarly
publications were an edition of Shakespeare's poems for Arden, published
in 1960, and a critical study of Shakespeare's poetry, which came out
three years later.

Although his poetry never received the attention its qualities might
have expected, Prince was honoured by the British academic
establishment: in 1968-69 he was a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College,
Oxford, and in 1972-73 he delivered the Clark lecture series at
Cambridge.

For the academic year 1985-86, he was elected President of the English
Association, a body he surprised by delivering his annual address in
verse.

Many critics thought Prince a "poet's poet" - though this sloppy
judgment often meant no more than saying that his poetry does not fit in
neatly to existing critical orthodoxies.

Certainly, his work was resolutely indifferent to poetic fashions, and
his maverick nature was indicated by the variety of his publishers:
Faber, Fortune Press, Rupert Hart-Davis, Fulcrum, Menard (whose current
editor, Anthony Rudolf, has been one of Prince's most energetic
champions), Anvil, and, most recently, Carcanet, who published his final
Collected Poems in 1993.

He is survived by his wife Elizabeth (n=E9e Bush), whom he married in
1943, and two daughters.

----------------------
Soldiers Bathing was the title poem of Prince's second volume, published
in the 1950s.

Soldiers Bathing

  The sea at evening moves across the sand.=20

  Under a reddening sky I watch the freedom of a band=20

  Of soldiers who belong to me. Stripped bare=20

  For bathing in the sea, they shout and run in the warm air;=20

  Their flesh worn by the trade of war, revives=20

  And my mind towards the meaning of it strives.

  All's pathos now. The body that was gross,=20

  Rank, ravenous, disgusting in the act or in repose,=20

  All fever, filth and sweat, its bestial strength=20

  And bestial decay, by pain and labour grows at length=20

  Fragile and luminous. 'Poor bare forked animal,'=20

  Conscious of his desires and needs and flesh that rise and fall,=20

  Stands in the soft air, tasting after toil=20

  The sweetness of his nakedness: letting the sea-waves coil=20

  Their frothy tongues about his feet, forgets=20

  His hatred of the war, its terrible pressure that begets=20

  A machinery of death and slavery,=20

  Each being a slave and making slaves of others: finds that he=20

  Remembers his old freedom in a game=20

  Mocking himself, and comically mimics fear and shame.

  He plays with death and animality;=20

  And reading in the shadows of his pallid flesh, I see=20

  The idea of Michelangelo's cartoon=20

  Of soldiers bathing, breaking off before they were half done=20

  At some sortie of the enemy, an episode=20

  Of the Pisan wars with Florence. I remember how he showed=20

  Their muscular limbs that clamber from the water,=20

  And heads that turn across the shoulder, eager for the slaughter,=20

  Forgetful of their bodies that are bare,=20

  And hot to buckle on and use the weapons lying there.

  =96And I think too of the theme another found=20

  When, shadowing men's bodies on a sinister red ground

  Another Florentine, Pollaiuolo,=20

  Painted a naked battle: warriors, straddled, hacked the foe,=20

  Dug their bare toes into the ground and slew=20

  The brother-naked man who lay between their feet and drew

  His lips back from his teeth in a grimace.

  They were Italians who knew war's sorrow and disgrace=20

  And showed the thing suspended, stripped: a theme=20

  Born out of the experience of war's horrible extreme=20

  Beneath a sky where even the air flows=20

  With lacrimae Christi. For that rage, that bitterness, those blows,=20

  That hatred of the slain, what could they be=20

  But indirectly or directly a commentary=20

  On the Crucifixion? And the picture burns=20

  With indignation and pity and despair by turns,=20

  Because it is the obverse of the scene=20

  Where Christ hangs murdered, stripped, upon the Cross. I mean,=20

  That is the explanation of its rage.

  And we too have our bitterness and pity that engage=20

  Blood, spirit, in this war. But night begins,=20

  Night of the mind: who nowadays is conscious of our sins?=20

  Though every human deed concerns our blood,=20

  And even we must know, what nobody has understood,=20

  That some great love is over all we do,=20

  And that is what has driven us to this fury, for so few=20

  Can suffer all the terror of that love:=20

  The terror of that love has set us spinning in this groove=20

  Greased with our blood.

  These dry themselves and dress,

  Combing their hair, forget the fear and shame of nakedness.

  Because to love is frightening we prefer

  The freedom of our crimes. Yet, as I drink the dusky air,

  I feel a strange delight that fills me full,

  Strange gratitude, as if evil itself were beautiful,

  And kiss the wound in thought, while in the west

  I watch a streak of red that might have issued from Christ's breast.

please SUBSCRIBE and submit.

i've also got the pdf files for our last issue, dialogues, working
again. this was a pilot program where we posted the pdf in an attempt to
provide chain to a wider, particularly international, audience. we
haven't yet determined if this helps or hurts sales yet (and at some
point the files went dead making determination even harder). if you have
any feedback on this (like i looked at the pdf and then ordered the
issue OR i looked at the pdf and then decided not to order the issue
since i got it for free), we would appreciate hearing from you.

Subject: F T Prince - 1912-2003


F.T. Prince passed away yesterday at 90. Of the various literary
conservatives who were variously adopted over the years by the NY
School, this South African born British Shakespeare & Milton specialist,
who later taught at Brandeis & in Yemen, was the most formal. I saw him
read once in NY many years ago with John Ashbery & Ann Lauterbach -- he
seemed frail even then (nearly 20 years ago).

Here's the obit & his most famous poem:

F T Prince
(Filed: 08/08/2003)


F T Prince, who died yesterday aged 90, was one of the most interesting
and underrated poets of the 20th century.

During the Second World War he worked as an Intelligence officer at
Bletchley Park and in the Middle East, and composed what came to be his
best-known poem, Soldiers Bathing, a moving meditation in rhyming
couplets on the "bitterness and pity that engage / Blood, spirit, in
this war."

It concludes with a mysteriously resonant image of sacrifice, one which
contrasts absolutely with the deft ironies of more cynical Second World
War poets such as Keith Douglas: "I feel a strange delight that fills me
full, / Strange gratitude, as if evil itself were beautiful, / And kiss
the wound in thought, while in the west / I watch a streak of red that
might have issued from Christ's breast."

Prince was a poet whose work critics found particularly difficult to
classify. His first collection, austerely entitled Poems, was published
by Faber in 1938.

It is not hard to see why this manuscript from an unknown 25-year-old
South African should have impressed Faber's then editor, T S Eliot. The
poems fuse an extraordinary literary sophistication with an elusive,
subtle lyricism and oblique, ever-shifting angles of vision.

Nothing could have been further from the political tub-thumping or
knockabout farce of the dominant English poet of the 1930s, W H Auden.
Prince explored the language of his various speakers, such as Edmund
Burke, or the Zulu prince Chaka, or an invented 17th-century artist
appealing for funds to his patron, with a disinterestedness that is
particularly astonishing given that the poems were composed on the eve
of the Second World War.

Despite this auspicious debut, Prince's next volume, Soldiers Bathing,
did not appear until 1954, and then with a different publisher (Fortune
Press). The poems collected here were again intensely literary and
self-conscious. Prince made brilliant use of the dramatic monologue
developed in the mid-19th century by Tennyson and Browning to give the
thoughts of Michelangelo in old age and of the Sybil.

Prince's retelling of this myth is one of his most successful long
poems. According to the Ancient Greek legend, the god of the sun,
Apollo, fell in love with the Sybil and agreed to grant her any wish.
She asked to live as many years as there were grains in a certain heap
of dust, but forgot to ask for enduring youth. Apollo and the Sybil
reveals with particular clarity Prince's immaculate control of sound,
rhythm, and the energies of syntax. Radiant land and seascapes are
played off the Sybil's physical decrepitude and insistent self-doubts:

And now a low brown person, shrinking slowly to a bag of skin, / I
wonder at myself, and even more that, were I to begin, // I think that I
should do what I have done. // And gulls, swallows, turn down wind, /
The sea toils, grinds and crushes / Marble to milk at cliff-base .

Prince's poems had attracted by this time an eclectic band of fervent
admirers. This small but select fan-club included poets as dissimilar
from one another as Geoffrey Hill and John Ashbery, both of whom
contributed to a special issue of P N Review dedicated to the work of
Prince that was published last year. It was Ashbery who successfully
sponsored Prince's candidacy for the E M Forster award he received from
the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Frank Templeton Prince was born in the mining town of Kimberley, South
Africa, on September 13 1912, and educated at the Christian Brothers'
College in Kimberley. He went on to Balliol College, Oxford, where he
read English, and continued his literary studies at Princeton.

Prince was an academic scholar as well as a poet. His study of Italian
influences on Milton's poetry was published in 1954, and is still one of
the standard works on this subject.

From 1957 to 1974 Prince was a Professor of English at Southampton
University, and after his retirement he accepted a number of
professorships at a diverse array of institutions: the University of
Jamaica (1975-78); Brandeis University in America (1978-80); and Sana'a
University, North Yemen (1981-83).

Aside from his monograph on Milton, his other most significant scholarly
publications were an edition of Shakespeare's poems for Arden, published
in 1960, and a critical study of Shakespeare's poetry, which came out
three years later.

Although his poetry never received the attention its qualities might
have expected, Prince was honoured by the British academic
establishment: in 1968-69 he was a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College,
Oxford, and in 1972-73 he delivered the Clark lecture series at
Cambridge.

For the academic year 1985-86, he was elected President of the English
Association, a body he surprised by delivering his annual address in
verse.

Many critics thought Prince a "poet's poet" - though this sloppy
judgment often meant no more than saying that his poetry does not fit in
neatly to existing critical orthodoxies.

Certainly, his work was resolutely indifferent to poetic fashions, and
his maverick nature was indicated by the variety of his publishers:
Faber, Fortune Press, Rupert Hart-Davis, Fulcrum, Menard (whose current
editor, Anthony Rudolf, has been one of Prince's most energetic
champions), Anvil, and, most recently, Carcanet, who published his final
Collected Poems in 1993.

He is survived by his wife Elizabeth (née Bush), whom he married in
1943, and two daughters.

----------------------
Soldiers Bathing was the title poem of Prince's second volume, published
in the 1950s.

Soldiers Bathing

  The sea at evening moves across the sand.

  Under a reddening sky I watch the freedom of a band

  Of soldiers who belong to me. Stripped bare

  For bathing in the sea, they shout and run in the warm air;

  Their flesh worn by the trade of war, revives

  And my mind towards the meaning of it strives.

  All's pathos now. The body that was gross,

  Rank, ravenous, disgusting in the act or in repose,

  All fever, filth and sweat, its bestial strength

  And bestial decay, by pain and labour grows at length

  Fragile and luminous. 'Poor bare forked animal,'

  Conscious of his desires and needs and flesh that rise and fall,

  Stands in the soft air, tasting after toil

  The sweetness of his nakedness: letting the sea-waves coil

  Their frothy tongues about his feet, forgets

  His hatred of the war, its terrible pressure that begets

  A machinery of death and slavery,

  Each being a slave and making slaves of others: finds that he

  Remembers his old freedom in a game

  Mocking himself, and comically mimics fear and shame.

  He plays with death and animality;

  And reading in the shadows of his pallid flesh, I see

  The idea of Michelangelo's cartoon

  Of soldiers bathing, breaking off before they were half done

  At some sortie of the enemy, an episode

  Of the Pisan wars with Florence. I remember how he showed

  Their muscular limbs that clamber from the water,

  And heads that turn across the shoulder, eager for the slaughter,

  Forgetful of their bodies that are bare,

  And hot to buckle on and use the weapons lying there.

  -And I think too of the theme another found

  When, shadowing men's bodies on a sinister red ground

  Another Florentine, Pollaiuolo,

  Painted a naked battle: warriors, straddled, hacked the foe,

  Dug their bare toes into the ground and slew

  The brother-naked man who lay between their feet and drew

  His lips back from his teeth in a grimace.

  They were Italians who knew war's sorrow and disgrace

  And showed the thing suspended, stripped: a theme

  Born out of the experience of war's horrible extreme

  Beneath a sky where even the air flows

  With lacrimae Christi. For that rage, that bitterness, those blows,

  That hatred of the slain, what could they be

  But indirectly or directly a commentary

  On the Crucifixion? And the picture burns

  With indignation and pity and despair by turns,

  Because it is the obverse of the scene

  Where Christ hangs murdered, stripped, upon the Cross. I mean,

  That is the explanation of its rage.

  And we too have our bitterness and pity that engage

  Blood, spirit, in this war. But night begins,

  Night of the mind: who nowadays is conscious of our sins?

  Though every human deed concerns our blood,

  And even we must know, what nobody has understood,

  That some great love is over all we do,

  And that is what has driven us to this fury, for so few

  Can suffer all the terror of that love:

  The terror of that love has set us spinning in this groove

  Greased with our blood.

  These dry themselves and dress,

  Combing their hair, forget the fear and shame of nakedness.

  Because to love is frightening we prefer

  The freedom of our crimes. Yet, as I drink the dusky air,

  I feel a strange delight that fills me full,

  Strange gratitude, as if evil itself were beautiful,

  And kiss the wound in thought, while in the west

  I watch a streak of red that might have issued from Christ's breast.

It's great to see a book of poems by the critic Barry Schwabsky.whose
art writing I've admired for so many years.  I didn't expect it would
be as good as it is--for how many art writers of the first rank
really can write poetry?  (How many human beings do any two things
especially well?)  But Schwabsky is an unexpected exception.  The
promo material describes him as a poet writing "outside" of poetry,
and that gibes with the strangely foreign flavor of his work, which
sometimes seems to have been translated from a more delicate language
than English.  On the other hand it's often colloquial, lived-in, the
"vulgar tongue," the trailer park trash talk mixed in with the
references to Wittgenstein and Valery Larbaud  and Traherne.  One
poem even boasts an epigraph by A.A. Fair, which I've never seen
happen before in a book of poetry.

On the back jacket David Shapiro speaks of the compression of
Schwabsky's writing, it's true, no poem goes on much longer than a
page or two, and those that do are linked shorter lyrics.  I don't
know yet what "Opera" means, but I'm working on it.

One odd result of this unfamiliarity, by which I mean the alterity of
his poetic diction, is that, although the book's subtitle is "Poems
1981-2002," I'm hard pressed to follow any pattern of growth, or
decay, the way one might be able to with another author.  The
references to other poets--to Elaine Equi, Clark Coolidge, John
Yau--might have been made at any time during that period, for they're
none of them youngsters.  Were the poems written in chronological
order?  I don't think so--but I'm just guessing because the opening
sequence, "Opera"" employs the now-familiar trope of the
remix--there's a "Club Mix" of it, a "Bandwidth Mix"" and so on,
which wasn't so familiar back in 1981 was it?  I don't think so,
though now it's a yawny commonplace in poetry I suppose.  Anyhow
it'll all come clear the more I read of this book.  Congratulations
to you, Eileen Tabios, for having the gumption to publish such a
unique and satisfying work.  Hope that some of you on the Poetics
List will buy it and tell me what you think.

Subject:      Re: PRE-PUBLICATION OFFER on OPERA by BARRY SCHWABSKY
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Schwabsky has this uncanny and deft way of pairing opposites- opposing
images and ideas, these ideas of 'something else' that can't be said in
regular speech, even as he utilizes such speech at times to say it. And I
mean to spell else with a capital E. It's the something else that has me
puzzling over this book and picking it up again and again- he's writing
about desire and love and longing through the all that it isn't and by doing
this he swiftly articulates all that it is. Capital I. And still so
difficult to say, catch and hold for more than a glimpse or a moment of when
you actually 'get' the what that is happening to you.

It may be Schwabsky's skills in perception and inquiry (as in the necessary
intercourse with a work of art to then proceed and write salient criticism)
that give his writing this "outside" and incisive sense; it's as if the
sensations of experience captured in these poems come from this same space
of outsideness- as poems written inside particular
moments/experiences/thoughts while disembodied and trying to make sense of
it or make it last or understand or...or--my copy has all these crazy folds
at top corners and bottom corners to mark the places I keep going back to.
I've mangled the poor thing in loving it.

It's an absolutely beautiful book. Lines like: "We / who read with our pens
/ invent beautiful reasons. / You the thief of what can't / be stolen are
their favorite / servant." and: "I hereby unrecognize you, / sweet study of
limit." (from the title poem, "Opera," _OPERA_, Barry Schwabsky, Meritage,
2003) I could read again and again and again. Which might be the highest
praise one can give a book: unresolvable beckoning.

near the ending of this series these lines transform
a landscape through its furrowing and destiny

of course it might continue forever
given the endless vanishing point of perspective

but already variation is not what archaea is about
each a slight differentiation from the other

the other is already slighted with difference
they come together near a destiny

E-ZPoem Plans   "Verse and Worse"

=====
=====

E-ZPoem Basic Plan

New York State Speedread & the Poetry Authority of
New York & New Jersey: No minimum use is required.
At all Poetry Authority facilities, E-ZPoem discounts are
available during peak and off-peak hours, and $.50
discount off the cash toll at libraries and bookstores. This
plan may be used wherever you see the E-ZPoem sign.

=====

Special Reader/Resident Discount Plans

Poetry Authority Group Reading Plan: Requires 3 or
more readers for each poem. The discounted $1.00 feel
is applied only in Full Service facilities. Please remember
to come to a complete stop at the cashier's booth. Use in
E-ZPoem ONLY facilities prohibited.

Speedread Commuter Plan: For reading on buses,
trains, or in cars (one reader ONLY). Monthly minimum
reading charge of $17 (17 reads at $1.00 a read) vs.
the full toll of $3.00 per read.

Rent-a-Critic Plan: Fully qualified, experienced critics
are available at all Full Service facilities, rentable by
the minute, half-hour, hour, day, week or month.
All questions answered in easy-to-understand English.
Sample rates: $1 for 1 minute; $25 for one half hour;
$45 for one hour; $360 for one business day (8 hrs.);
and so on.

Rent-a-Poet Plan (Applies to living poets ONLY):
$.50 for one half hour; $.90 for one hour; $7.50 for
one business day (8 hrs.); and so on. For a $3 surcharge
you can rent the author of the poem you're reading.

Rent-a-Teacher Plan: The federal Leave-No-Child-
Behind Program has left many out-of-work teachers
available to help readers like you sort out feet and
rhymes and metaphors and such, so that you'll be
reading like a "pro" in no time. We'll supply a catalog
of names, and you can negotiate a long- or short-
term plan on your own. (HINT) Just between us,
most of these teachers will work for food.

For even lower rates on these last three plans, check
out our online specials at www.E-ZPoem.com .

two things:

1) Does anyone have any contact info for poetry publishers in China,
specifically publishers willing to look at book length “experimental” work
and/or prose poetry translated from English into Chinese?

2) I have two copies of both Michael Palmer’s The Circular Gates and Without
Music & am looking to trade one of them for a copy of Blake’s Newton.

To: undisclosed-recipients:;

Aram Saroyan

Aram Saroyan's first mainstream book of poems, called Aram Saroyan,
comprises thirty minimal poems, without titles, and can be read easily from
cover to cover in a minute or two. Soon after it appeared in 1968, in fact,
the book was read from cover to cover on NBC News by Edwin Newman. His
latest books are Day and Night: Bolinas Poems and Artists in Trouble: New
Stories (both Black Sparrow/Godine) and Starting Out in the Sixties,
selected essays (Talisman).


SPECIAL COLLECTIONS


In a room at UCLA’s Special Collections Library, I’m set up with an old
fashioned spool-to-spool tape recorder in order to listen to a radio
interview I did one night in Morningside Heights thirty five years ago when
I was a sixties poet. I hear the voice that once was my own: the slow,
irritating, callow voice of my budding self.

Why am I doing this? I wonder. I’m 57, happily married, three times a
father, my children grown up, my father long gone to the hereafter, my
mother recently gone. Something must be sadly amiss for it to come to this
pointless self-scrutiny. Who was I? Or rather, who cares? Walking out of
the building into the evening chill of a warm November day in Los Angeles, I
feel belatedly apologetic toward the interviewer--a decent, stolid sort
saddled with this weirdo of post-modern manners. I owe him, and I haven’t
seen or heard from him since that fateful night.

I walk to my car parked on LeConte in the darkening twilight. The night the
radio program was broadcast in New York City, I took an all-night acid trip
with some friends in a cold-water flat on the Lower East Side. I’d eagerly
anticipated hearing my voice over the airwaves, and the opportunity, in my
altered state, to discover in it nuances that would otherwise be
unascertainable. As it turned out, my friend Derek had not been able to
find the station that broadcast the interview--a lame excuse, yet another
signature of his passive aggressive jealousy, an old wearying story by now,
but not one I’d allow to interfere with the psychedelic main event of the
evening.

What a great favor poor Derek had done me. I find 12 minutes left on the
two hour meter where I parked. I would have hated myself, perhaps for the
entire intervening 35 years, had I listened to the interview that night.
Instead I focused on the grain of the parquet floor, and saw slowly emerge
from it, a tiny, stately procession--on floats--of Semite kings bedecked
with crowns and scepters.

I wake up in the middle of the night, still roiling with inner torment.
With my head cushioned against my upper arm, lying full-length on the floor
of that third-floor apartment on the corner of Avenue A and Sixth Street,
how I had scrutinized the extraordinary detail of those Semite kings. A Jew
on acid, I think, and the words "camp concentration" come to me. In the
dark, I reach out for my notebook and pen by the bed.


OLD POET


Sometimes a poet touches you
Though you know he’s not very good
But you hear some clanking music
Through the vowels and consonants
Knocking each other around
And it reminds you that this guy
Was once around hailing cabs
Riding sedately prone in the back
As the city rolled by, subsumed by snow
He’s thinking of his life long ago
In another even colder atmosphere
That’s given him a personal ruddiness
And a certain blustery bravado
That reads better in his native language…
No matter--because what can’t get translated
Comes through anyway in the oddball music
Which isn’t exactly great, but himself

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...


KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

        Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

Here`s how:

~ Set www-links to ->  http://www.eskimo.com/~bbrace/12hr.html

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

language is poetry

                Chapter 2 of *Words and Their Ways in English Speech*,
                1900, by James B. Greenough and George Lyman Kittredge.

"...there are formal or dignified or poetical words for simple conceptions
(like *residence*, *progeny*, *quaff*, *masticate*)..."

*The number of the dead
long exceedeth all that shall live.
The night of time
far surpasseth the day,
and who knows when was the equinox?
But the sufficiency of Christian immortality
frustrates all earthly glory,
and the quality of either state after death
makes a folly of posthumous memory.*
Therefore I have always wanted to be
somewhere else, anywhere
anywhere out of this world, someplace simple, to quaff
and masticate a Turkish houri
for simple conception, a Holy War
in my residence--and progeny
like the grains of sand on the banks
of the Sea of Marmara
and progeny like the considerable drops
in the Bosporus.

"...there are vague words (like *thing*, *affair*, *matter*, *act*, *do*)..."

please hon let me put my thing in
you act so funny
what's the matter
                           do you know
I have always wanted an affair on an antimacassar
a covering thrown over chairs sofas etc. to protect them
from grease in the hair etc., or as an ornament

"...there are scientific terms of rigid exactness (like *oxygen*, *atmosphere*,
*chloride*, *carbon*, *inoculate*)..."

of course because what I've always wanted
is a fort of rigid exactness, like To inoculate the air with seeding crystals;
will have would, to have to can
to would have will, to can have might should may--
subjunctive and out of categories
                                                  not
like the past perfect They had inoculated the carbon
with chloride oxygen in the sense of an atmosphere
                                                                             or
perfect in the future, add a little doubt, maybe a no...
like They would not have inoculated the oxygen with carbon
chloride under an atmosphere. What I've always wanted
is to be perfect
                       I
have carboned, I have encarboned, I have carbonized,
I have carbonated, I have modernly integrated
my sweet inoculant in soft bituminous atmosphere,
                                                                            how
she rises oxygen in her moon belly and then haaugghh
she vlarps backwards and I catharized in happy blank, I
chlorided--a nearly white powder made by passing chlorine gas over slaked
                                              lime and used as a bleach and disinfectant.

"...there are words of a distinctly undignified character (like *chum*, *crank*,
*bamboozle*, *blubber*, *baul*, *fizzle*..."

I played with Victoria
she gave me a bawl
after seeing my crank
tower in the throne-room, no blubber
for she; bamboozle, bamboozle
bamboozle with me,
                               roll
on the red bed drapes,
said her. o how the categories
fizzled.

"...others so dignified as to be uncommon in familiar talk (as *remunera-
tive*, *emolument*, *eleemosynary*, *recalcitrant*)..."

I once wanted
a recalcitrant lover, a hot
Latin with purple eyes and long
flannely fingers working me, she'd whisper
*emolumentum*/exertion/profit
in her language, to be paid, and so to please
plunging me.
                   I'd wash her ears in lave, I'd whisper:
Speech after long silence; it is right
All other lovers being estranged or dead,
to speak of Freud: *Contributions to the Psychology of Love:
The Most Prevalent Form of Degradation in Erotic Live, 1912*
to tell my sweet Umbrian
                                       "it is possible, too,
        that the tendency so often observed in men of the highest class in
        society to take a woman of a low class as a permanent mistress, or
        even as a wife, is nothing but a consequence of the need for a lower
        type of sexual object on which, psychologically, the possibility of com-
        plete gratification depends."

                                                       How remunerative

to be eleemosynary; how civilized to be
discontent. In this apartment house
I don't know my neighbors, we all have police locks, it is
a category for the insane, 1965, a complex state.

"...there are words so high-sounding as hardly to be allowable even in
elaborate writing (as *exacerbate*, *cachinnation*, *adumbrate*)..."

elaborately I listen to my friend Ted cachinnate.
"say Ted can you adumbrate? like why are you laughing at me?"
(I love these conversations in the head) Ted says,
"you Jew me Zen
you ethic
me phlegm." Too bad
I have always wanted to not ask questions.

"...and others so prosaic that every poet avoids them (as *fry*, *exchequer*,
*discount*, *cross-question*, *extra*, *medium*, *miscellaneous*)..."

the miscellaneous
makes up the substance. If it is
the substance it must be
the miscellaneous, the out
of focus, the small
glimmer off a penny dropped in the beach sand,
                                                                        con-
fusion of copper and silicones to the boy
walking slowly head down looking and to the horseshoe
crab.
        I send photographs of the exchequer, of the
chancellor of the exchequer as a tension relaxer
to those who were chosen of those
who might have been taken of all those eligible
to fry in the Viet-Nam sun.
                                         I forget
whether I'm sending substance, or the form of fellow-feeling
in a joke, which might be rejected, or
                                                         the miscellaneous,
like a glimmer.
                      I prepare eggs, bacon, strong coffee
most mornings. I feed,
medium man, thinking
Troy, Maccabees, Galahad, Gawain, the corny
extras of battle good for books.
                                                Across the way, tired
in the daylight, Achilles calls up to me
from his torn sulking-tent. He
cross-questions me, it is about modern
history. I offer him pumpernickel toast.
                                                           It is
Tuesday morning, friendship and food, a category.
We are all
                at a discount.

"...and others so childish as to be confined to the dialect of the
nursery (as *naughty*, *mammy*, *dad*, *dolly*)..."

Very like. I have oft been known to quote M. Val=E9ry, and am glad to

Thanks, Tom, for the info about Fulcrum. Perhaps I'll send them some stuff.
Meanwhile, since you and Carolyn Vash both asked a while back for "a wee
sample" of my poetry, here's another one. Analyze this from an 80-year-old
widower.

     Not About Where the Radio Is

Now I sleep on her side--
   What had been her side.
If my granddaughter asked, I'd say,
"Because that's where the radio is."
But that's not it.

I moved to her side--
   What had been her side--
Because just before we went to sleep
I'd lightly touch her warm left foot
With my right
As a sort of goodnight kiss.

And sometimes in the morning, half awake,
With eyes still closed,
Our feet would touch
Half an hour before we had to get up.

For weeks, with my morning eyes still unopened,
I'd slide my foot slightly to her side.
   Then farther.
And shake awake to feel the sheets were cold there.

Now that I'm sleeping on--
   What had been her side,
I've stopped slipping my foot across.
The radio is easier to reach and
The sheets there are warm again.

Can someone point me to a blog entry or otherwise explain what -- and
who -- is meant by 'School of Quietude' for those of us too dumb to pick
up on or find convincing explanations? I understand the initial 1800's
Poe instance which labels the Boston proponents of that time with a
'more quiet conception of literature' but get lost from there on out.
What is the relevance for today? Many thanks as this would improve my
understanding.

Myth and Denial in the War Against Terrorism
                   By William Blum

    It dies hard.  It dies very hard.  The notion that terrorist acts agains=

the United States can be explained by envy and irrational hatred, and not by=
=20
what the United States does in and to the world -- i.e., US foreign policy -=
-=20
is alive and well. =20
    The fires were still burning intensely at Ground Zero when Colin Powell=20
declared: "Once again, we see terrorism, we see terrorists, people who don't=
=20
believe in democracy ..."{1}
    George W. picked up on that theme and ran with it.  He's been its leadin=
g=20
proponent ever since September 11 with his repeated insistence, in one=20
wording or another, that "those people hate America, they hate all that it s=
tands=20
for, they hate our democracy, our freedom, our wealth, our secular governmen=
t."=20
(Ironically, the president and John Ashcroft probably hate our secular=20
government as much as anyone.)
    One of Bush's many subsequent versions of this incantation, delivered=20
more than a year after 9-11, was: "The threats we face are global terrorist=20
attacks.  That's the threat.  And the more you love freedom, the more likely=
 it is=20
you'll be attacked."{2}
    In September 2002, the White House released the "National Security=20
Strategy", purported to be chiefly the handiwork of Condoleezza Rice, which=20=
speaks=20
of the "rogue states" which "sponsor terrorism around the globe; and reject=20
basic human values and hate the United States and everything for which it=20
stands."=20
    As recently as July of this year the spokesman for Homeland Security,=20
Brian Roehrkasse, declared: "Terrorists hate our freedoms.  They want to cha=
nge=20
our ways."{3}
    Thomas Friedman the renowned foreign policy analyst of the New York Time=
s=20
would say amen.  Terrorists, he wrote in 1998 after terrorists attacked two=20
US embassies in Africa, "have no specific ideological program or demands. =20
Rather, they are driven by a generalized hatred of the US, Israel and other=20
supposed enemies of Islam."{4}
    This id=C3=A9e fixe -- that the rise of anti-American terrorism owes not=
hing=20
to American policies -- in effect postulates an America that is always the=20
aggrieved innocent in a treacherous world, a benign United States government=
=20
peacefully going about its business but being "provoked" into taking extreme=

measures to defend its people, its freedom and democracy.  There consequentl=
y is no=20
good reason to modify US foreign policy, and many people who might otherwise=
=20
know better are scared into supporting the empire's wars out of the belief t=
hat=20
there's no choice but to crush without mercy -- or even without evidence --=20
this irrational international force out there that hates the United States w=
ith=20
an abiding passion.
     Thus it was that Afghanistan and Iraq were bombed and invaded with=20
seemingly little concern in Washington that this could well create many new=20
anti-American terrorists.  And indeed, since the first strike on Afghanistan=
 there=20
have been literally scores of terrorist attacks against American institution=
s in=20
the Middle East, South Asia and the Pacific, about a dozen in Pakistan alone=

States, the latest being the heavy bombing of the US-managed Marriott Hotel=20=
in=20
Jakarta, Indonesia, the site of diplomatic receptions and 4th of July=20
celebrations held by the American Embassy.

The word "terrorism" has been so overused in recent years that it's now=20
commonly used simply to stigmatize any individual or group one doesn't like,=
 for=20
almost any kind of behavior involving force.  But the word's raison d'=C3=

traditionally been to convey a political meaning, something along the lines=20=
of:=20
the deliberate use of violence against civilians and property to intimidate=20
or coerce a government or the population in furtherance of a political=20
objective.
    Terrorism is fundamentally propaganda, a very bloody form of propaganda.
    It follows that if the perpetrators of a terrorist act declare what thei=
r=20
objective was, their statement should carry credibility, no matter what one=20
thinks of the objective or the method used to achieve it.  Let us look at so=
me=20
actual cases.
    The terrorists responsible for the bombing of the World Trade Center in=20
1993 sent a letter to the New York Times which stated, in part: "We declare=20=
our=20
responsibility for the explosion on the mentioned building.  This action was=
=20
done in response for the American political, economical, and military suppor=
t=20
to Israel the state of terrorism and to the rest of the dictator countries i=
n=20
the region."{5}=20
    Richard Reid, who tried to ignite a bomb in his shoe while aboard an=20
American Airline flight to Miami in December 2001, told police that his plan=
ned=20
suicide attack was an attempt to strike a blow against the US campaign in=20
Afghanistan and the Western economy.  In an e-mail sent to his mother, which=
 he=20
intended her to read after his death, Reid wrote that it was his duty "to he=
lp=20
remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslims land."{6}
     After the October 2002 bombings in Bali, Indonesia, which destroyed two=
=20
nightclubs and killed more than 200 people, one of the leading suspects told=
=20
police that the bombings were "revenge" for "what Americans have done to=20
Muslims."  He said that he wanted to "kill as many Americans as possible" be=
cause=20
"America oppresses the Muslims".{7}
    In November 2002, a taped message from Osama bin Laden began: "The road=20
to safety begins by ending the aggression.  Reciprocal treatment is part of=20
justice.  The [terrorist] incidents that have taken place ... are only react=
ions=20
and reciprocal actions."{8}
     That same month, when Mir Aimal Kasi, who killed several people outside=
=20
of CIA headquarters in 1993, was on death row, he declared: "What I did was=20=
a=20
retaliation against the US government" for American policy in the Middle Eas=
t=20
and its support of Israel.{9}
    It should be noted that the State Department warned at the time that the=
=20
execution of Kasi could result in attacks against Americans around the=20
world.{10}  It did not warn that the attacks would result from foreigners ha=
ting or=20
envying American democracy, freedom, wealth, or secular government.
    Similarly, in the days following the start of US bombing of Afghanistan=20
there were numerous warnings from US government officials about being prepar=
ed=20
for retaliatory acts, and during the war in Iraq, the State Department=20
announced: "Tensions remaining from the recent events in Iraq may increase t=
he=20
potential threat to US citizens and interests abroad, including by terrorist=
=20
groups."{11}
     Another example of the difficulty the Bush administration has in=20
consistently maintaining its simplistic id=C3=A9e fixe: In June 2002, after=20=
a car bomb=20
exploded outside the US Consulate in Karachi, killing or injuring more than=20=

people, the Washington Post reported that "US officials said the attack was=20
likely the work of extremists angry at both the United States and Pakistan's=
=20
president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, for siding with the United States after Se=
ptember=20
11 and abandoning support for Afghanistan's ruling Taliban."{12}
    George W. and high officials of his administration may or may not believ=
e=20
what they tell the world about the motivations behind anti-American=20
terrorism, but, as in the recent examples just given, other officials have q=
uestioned=20
the party line for years.  A Department of Defense study in 1997 concluded:=20
"Historical data show a strong correlation between US involvement in=20
international situations and an increase in terrorist attacks against the Un=
ited=20
States."{13}
     Jimmy Carter told the New York Times in a 1989 interview: "We sent=20
Marines into Lebanon and you only have to go to Lebanon, to Syria or to Jord=
an to=20

f=20
those who are deeply resentful. That is what precipitated the taking of our=20
hostages and that is what has precipitated some of the terrorist attacks."{1=
4}
    Colin Powell has also revealed that he knows better.  Writing of this=20

    To what extent do Americans really believe the official disconnect=20

cation=20
that the public is somewhat skeptical came in the days immediately following=
=20
the commencement of the bombing of Iraq on March 20 of this year.  The airli=
nes=20
later announced that there had been a sharp increase in cancellations of=20
flights and a sharp decrease in future flight reservations in those few days=
.{17}=20
    In June, the Pew Research Center released the results of polling in 20=20
Muslim countries and the Palestinian territories that brought the official=20
disconnect into question even more dramatically.  The polling revealed that=20=
people=20
interviewed had much more "confidence" in Osama bin Laden than in George W.=20
Bush.  However, "the survey suggested little correlation between support for=

anti-bin Laden respondents also differed little in their views on the=20

The Washington mentality about alleged terrorist motivations also manifests=20
itself in current US occupation policy in Iraq.  Secretary of War Donald=20
Rumsfeld has declared that there are five groups opposing US forces -- loote=

criminals, remnants of Saddam Hussein's government, foreign terrorists and t=

ot=20
dedicated fighters," he said. "They're people who wanted to take a few=20

     With such language do American officials avoid dealing with the idea=20

are demonstrating their resentment.  Some officials convinced themselves tha=
t=20
it was largely the most loyal followers of Saddam Hussein and his two sons w=
ho=20
were behind the daily attacks on Americans, and that with the capture or=20
killing of the evil family, resistance would die out; tens of millions of do=
llars=20
were offered as reward for information leading to this joyful prospect.  Thu=
s=20
it was that the killing of the sons elated military personnel.  US Army truc=
ks=20
with loudspeakers drove through small towns and villages to broadcast a=20
message about the death of Hussein's sons.  "Coalition forces have won a gre=
at=20
victory over the Baath Party and the Saddam Hussein regime by killing Uday a=
nd=20
Qusay Hussein in Mosul," said the message broadcast in Arabic.  "The Baath P=
arty=20
has no power in Iraq.  Renounce the Baath Party or you are in great danger."=
 =20
It called on all officials of Hussein's government to turn themselves in.{21=
}
    What followed was several days of some of the deadliest attacks against=20
American personnel since the guerrilla war began.  Unfazed, American officia=
ls=20
in Washington and Iraq continue to suggest that the elimination of Saddam wi=
ll=20
write finis to anti-American actions.

Another way in which the political origins of terrorism are obscured is by=20
the common practice of blaming poverty or repression by Middle Eastern=20
governments (as opposed to US support for such governments) for the creation=
 of=20
terrorists.  Defenders of US foreign policy cite this also as a way of showi=
ng how=20
enlightened they are.  Here's Condoleezza Rice:

{The Middle East] is a region where hopelessness provides a fertile ground=20
for ideologies that convince promising youths to aspire not to a university=20
education, a career or family, but to blowing themselves up, taking as many=20
innocent lives with them as possible. ... We must address the source of the=20
problem.{22}

    Many on the left speak in a similar fashion, apparently unconscious of=20
what they're obfuscating.  This analysis confuses terrorism with revolution.

In light of the several instances mentioned above -- and others can be given=
=20
-- of US officials giving the game away, in effect admitting that terrorists=
=20
and guerrillas may be, or in fact are, reacting to perceived hurts and=20
injustices, it may be that George W. is the only true believer among them, i=
f in fact=20
he is one.  The leaders of the American Empire may well know -- at least=20
occasionally when they're sitting alone at midnight -- that all their expres=
sed=20
justifications for invading Iraq and Afghanistan and for their "War on Terro=
rism"=20
are no more than fairy tales for young children and grown-up innocents. =20
Officialdom doesn't make statements to represent reality.  It constructs sto=
ries=20
to pursue interests.  And the interests here are irresistibly compelling:=20
creating the most powerful empire in all history, enriching their class comr=
ades,=20
remaking the world in their own ideological image.

As I've written elsewhere: If I were the president, I could stop terrorist=20
attacks against the United States in a few days.  Permanently.  I would firs=
t=20
apologize -- very publicly and very sincerely -- to all the widows and orpha=
ns,=20
the impoverished and the tortured, and all the many millions of other victim=
s=20
of American imperialism.  Then I would announce that America's global milita=
ry=20
interventions have come to an end.  I would then inform Israel that it is no=
=20
longer the 51st state of the union but -=E2=80=93 oddly enough -=E2=80=93 a=20=
foreign country. =20
Then I would reduce the military budget by at least 90% and use the savings=20
to pay reparations to the victims and repair the damage from the many Americ=
an=20
bombings, invasions and sanctions.  There would be enough money.  One year o=
f=20
our military budget is equal to more than $20,000 per hour for every hour=20
since Jesus Christ was born.  That's one year.
    That's what I'd do on my first three days in the White House.  On the=20
fourth day, I'd be assassinated.

There appears to be some writing on the note ...
Is this whatever truth there is?
Because I wonder what the biz is.
Or if the biz is biz.
And who are you to gain the plane
Which has taken off (your clothes)
Leaving you plain and in pain
And nothing left you suppose
To your brain but a stain
When there is nothing to gain
Here hexed by text
Nothing more before
Nothing left to store

for Troy Cole/in memory of Susan Porucznik-Cole



a spike driven into the soft earth of the sky
might your soul well up from the rift
this gorge is a gorge  is a gorge hewn large
dwarfing your  oh I can  can I  you with me
just moments ago  just right here  I am reaching

resting here before your eyes  but for their red shift
sleeping quietly  a hush is loud sometimes
like my hand severed lying in the dust I cannot reattach
I cannot reach and grasp

but you are not a canyon  but
and  you are and more
and you have not fallen off me  and
but  you have and you must stay somehow
your smile  nova  your void

the fragrance of absence is an endless gift
of parts torment and parts wonder
it floats down with the release of the unwanted
on rides the kiss of weightless memory

and so I will plant a tree  in the hole  among the stars

for everyone else

swarming, diggers vomit up fresh earth, loading past stones and
erecting arches and pyramids. only to be superseded by reforms and
popular songs. as everyone would gather and sing in cheap theaters
surrounded by columns and imaginary birds. a sunbeam was gleaming off
pieces of freshly cut meat and plastic miniatures of everything.
swelling from putrefaction, a long dead leaf lowered itself gently into
the dirt. later in time it was announced that the day after tomorrow
there would be more plastic buckets with new optional colors. this was
a way for one to console themselves against the lack of development in
irony boards.

Armitage stands
thickly in a light
rubbing its great and electric back
across Alexei Karamazov

in a tradition of short lines(
these trees have grown
wantonly through
thinks he, though

the troughs of shallow days
fountain in animistic rain).
It ain't meekness, nor stupidity
pits itself against itself, flush with

sequences of truth, unquenching
us, and the time you thought I

could trumpet, I could be a peasant's
sleeve. There are days Armitage
clocks his heartbeat, days in which
the skin of dreams muffles the hydraulics.

Virginia unloosed her big tongue
and her blood bounce-soft
for benefit of Charles Lindbergh

{she was at some pains
to become his daughter}

her arms were bare,
& filled the pit & house,

her withered scabbard
still scissoring briefly to life

the crypt's
lining her mouth
with contrivance

{you should return to her
as a dog returns to his vomit}

would that I could bring
a sunken-ended summit
to those who once touched
off her transgressions!

her conduct will nose
into gorgeous old scandals

her penny sins every
weekend weakened
& whitened into coals

her clay is on all fours
beneath her skirt,
her inadmissible blot has
been sold into darkness -
still she spurns the highest
step of the Moon

famous surgeons are quite the reverse of picturesque. Few have the
sufficient ego strength to withstand the candies in her mouth. A clean

many ask for ONE. Her tomb'll bring him no profit - God forbid she should

HIVE!

this talk of canyons makes me so very haughty
this talk of death we must insult and make naughty

murdered in my hive



Part II


I am not sure if I am a bee or if I am dirt.  Have I told you that I hate
memorials?  I particularly hate the birds roosting inside them.  I hate the
popular songs that fill their corners.  So I generally hate people.  This
hate is like rotting beef, which makes me feel bad in several ways, or
plastic.  I don't buy anything plastic.  Well at least I try not to.
Rotting beef smells and I don't like that.  It makes me uncomfortable to
know I live at the cost of other lives.  I'm like that, yes.  I hate plastic
rotting beef and the very thought of an afterlife.  You know, people are so
stupid.  Plastic comes with consumer opportunity and I don't like that
either.

So I hate you and I hate your grief.  It was seven years ago today that
Sergeant Pepper played and played and the plastic smouldered and you
suffocated.  Goddamned popular songs and waxy figures with penises fixing
holes that need no fixing.  Madame Tussaud's little John Lennon.  It was
seven years ago today you bled and bled after you were dead.  Seated before
us like a monument to the soaking up of weeping black blood with towels.
Black blood running over linoleum brought by burning plastic following the
exploration of latex on flesh.  Encase me.  Wrap me like a plastic package
for it gets me off.  Seven years to the day they told you to play another is
splayed in a car wreck.  It smelled like rotting meat with that door frame
through your head.  To my wonderful husband, please clean up my brains.  I
left them on the road for you.  Like petals on that long carpet of blood at
the ceremony of reddest curtains.  Thanks for the memories.  Bye!  August 7.
They should make a monument out of that, your carrion on the road to be
picked like buzzards.  Or we can go back can we seven months less seven days
to a gun that blew the top of your head clean off.  You made a hat for your
parents to wear.  It's all coming up sevens.

But I want you to listen to me and my life instead.  Don't listen to that
grief.  Good god.  I carry a deeper wound because I say so and I will not
enjoy it, I refuse to enjoy it.  It is a burden.  I'd rather dig back into
the earth and live covered in dirt than listen to you or hear that applause.
Oh and I hate love, particularly the selfless kind.  When you give gifts to
friends in grief well I just hate it.  Heaven is for assholes, pal.

But I must be honest with you, for just a moment, since I can never be.
This is an impossible passage.  The applause fills the monuments and fills
the corners of my black heart with rage which I feel and bury deep in the
earth.  What heart?  My heart is your construction of oppression.  You are
the barbed wire.  It's rather impolite however to say it honestly.  But
don't tell me I'm passive aggressive.  John Ashbery took a lifetime to
become open and honest.  He made a career of running around the barn.  It
took little girls with exposed penises to have him stop drop and roll in the
barnburning hay.  Honest cocks in pretty skirts.  Or pretty cocks in honest
skirts.  Choose your adventure, I've chosen a lack of adventure.  So hide
those hermaphrodites, hide them under your tongues!  Because I hate you all
and I cannot tell you that.  There are awards to be won in the delusions and
the dispassionate aggressions.

I remember lots of discussion on this list about the body a while back --I
guess it's a subject of perennial interest, well anyway has anyone heard
Rick Springfield's song "Jessie's Girl" lately? I have, and I'm tripping
out on the line that comes after "Well she's watching him with those eyes..."

It goes, "And she's loving him with that body I just know it." How do you
take that "with that body": is it circumstantial, as in "She's loving him,
and by the way she has a great body"? Or are you like me and you're hearing
it as an ablative, as if the body were a mere instrument with which to love
someone? Like a wrench, or a mop, or? It might be disgusting, but I think
it's the most erotic thing I've ever heard.

In the interest of candor let me say that I've been taking these men's
multivitamins my friend stole for me, and they've got me not knowing how to
act. Have they overthrown my grammar as well? Am I still a feminist? Please
help me, I am trapped in the body of LRSN

It sounds to me that this is one of those twisted Jeff Foxwothy jokes, I
might be on extacy if ....  put down the "Best of the 80's" CD and go find
some rave and dance until dawn with whatever human is closest :-)

And for "Am I still a feminist?" I often answer that "hey, my mother is a
woman so, of course, I am a feminist!"

Mad Cow Sonnets, 1

The general onslaught, long-expected, is now at hand, so
nowadays it is wise to carry your paper money in hidden
pockets, at least until you reach Baghdad, serenely green
amid all those miles of burning sand. Cultural consequences

of lapsed faith--America reawakened to the winds of change,
three runs behind in the bottom of the ninth. The skin of
unbelief stretched out upon the infield grass, the rebuilt ball-
park's a refuge in an uncertain, violent world. Today's

special, some imitation of light. Organic pizza and sand-
wiches on the deck by the harbor. Fishermen still emptying
their bilges just off-shore. Environmental issues remain
unaddressed, though disgruntled fans find injury-plagued

teams no longer give them what they had long taken for
granted, take potshots at them from the sun-baked stands.

=====

Mad Cow Sonnets, 2

Gwethalyn felt like staying in bed for the day, but something
we have no word for aroused her suspicions. "We have nothing
on for Friday night," Lou said, frequently. Odious comparisons
normally dispensed with, the privy's details did not bear

looking into. Relinquishing, forgoing, forswearing--any one
of those terms would suffice. Even with her jewels locked away
in a safe, Gwethalyn could speak nary a word of Hakka,
though she often writes small books for nestlings, hers and others'.

We are waiving the waiting period for you while we seek
more definitions for "weakness"--your penchant for chocolate,
for example. "I feel like a cold beer now," Lou often said.
"Strange, you don't look like one," her usual retort.

Gwethalyn's friend Brittany, once a province in northwestern
France, now ensconced in a former lighthouse on the Maine coast.

Mad Cow Sonnets, 3

Major-General Onslaught felt like staying in bed for the day,
but something we have no word for aroused her suspicions.
We have nothing on for Friday, at least until you reach
Baghdad. Long-expected expectations, now at hand,

amid all those sandy, burning miles. Cultural consequences
did not bear close scrutiny, so nowadays it is wise to carry
your odious comparisons only in hidden pockets, at least
until you reach the bottom of the ninth, possibly your last chance,

as Gwethalyn often reminded you. America's reawakening,
put off till the very last minute. Planes full of twenty-dollar bills,
flown to Iraq, our "refuge" from a turbulent, violent world,
our penchant for chocolate and cold beer. Relinquishing,

forswearing. Taking potshots from the dugout at our new
teammates, bobbling grounders, losing pop-ups in the sun.

=====

Mad Cow Sonnets, 4

The long-expected onslaught, as generally understood,
began at the bottom of the ninth--lapsed faith stirred up
by winds of doctrine. Imitation light, burnt sand into
glass, hardening and darkening the skins of the players.

Politicians still empty their bilges just off-shore, wrapping
Ace bandages around tired knees, hiding jewels
and paper money in secret pockets in their gabardines.
Lou's comparisons (made in the privacy of his privy)

seemed frequently odious. Forswearing, forgoing. Serenely
green, the infield turf was watered by the tears of sailors
doubling as baseball players, awaiting orders to put out
to sea, their local teammates tripping over bases, losing pop-

ups in the sun. From sun-baked bleachers, disgruntled environment-
alists take potshots at them. "What's on Friday?" one of them asks.

=====

Mad Cow Sonnets, 5

"Teach the world to love baseball, pizza, and cold beer,"
Gwethalyn says, still not out of bed, "and all will be swell."
Her old friend Brittany forks a pickle from a jar and grins
her toothy grin in spite of everything. Something she had no

word for hardened, her smile--relinquishing, forswearing.
Around them, the general devastation, a scent of rat the pols
hadn't warned them of. Bobbled grounders in the bottom
of the ninth, ace pitchers' arms all wrapped in bandages.

Gwethalyn and Brittany hid their jewelry in secret pockets
even Lou didn't know about. Lapsed faith in paper money,
still serenely green, while the infield grass burned for lack
of water. Brittany's lighthouse, long decommissioned, stood

on its rock nonetheless, awaiting the long-expected bottom
of the ninth, the fluke broken-bat single up the middle.

=====

Mad Cow Sonnets, 6

Not privy to the details of the conspiracy, Gwethalyn
spends Fridays in her bed--forgoing, forswearing.
The general devastation stinks, as she says, to high heaven.
Lou didn't know her faith in paper money had lapsed.

Two men out in the bottom of the ninth, and the batter's
got no eye. "Nothing on for Friday night," Lou says. "We've
still no name for the Baghdad team, that slipshod bunch
of bobblers," but the waiting period had been waived.

Amid the general devastation, decommissioned lights
stood at the rocky points of land. "No one at State speaks
Hakka," it's been said. Disgruntled eco-mentalists petitioned
government for strict enforcement of established rules.

Groundskeepers tended the infield turf. Type in any word as
you think it sounds, and we'll take a shot at locating it for you.

Subject:      Ernst Herbeck site
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi Everyone,

I've been working on loose translations of Ernst Herbeck's poetry, and
posting them--along with a brief biography and interview--on a new site:

http://ernstherbeck.blogspot.com

Would love feedback on this project, especially by readers of German.

Gary

* * *

Ernst Herbeck, who died on September 11, 1991, at the age of 71, was
considered by Ernst Jandl to be one of the significant German poets of the
latter-half of the 20th century. Surprising, given the circumstances of
Herbeck's life and poetry:

A schizophrenic, institutionalized for nearly half a century, Herbeck was
born with a harelip so severe that it reportedly made him nearly
unintelligible. Shamed into muteness for much of his early life, he did not
take up writing as some kind of consolation, nor did he consider himself a
poet. It was only by someone else's intervention that he, somewhat
reluctantly, became one.

When the psychologist Leo Navratil met Herbeck for the first time in 1960,
he handed Herbeck a postcard-sized piece of Bristol-board and a pen and
asked him to write a poem with the title "Der Morgen" ("Morning"). After
thinking about it a few moments, Herbeck wrote the following poem:

Der Morgen.

Im Herbst da reiht der Feenwind
da sich im Shnee die
Mahnen treffen.
Amseln pfeifen heer
im Wind und fressen.

When Herbeck handed Leo Navratil the poem, Navratil was struck by both (a)
what he called its "schizophrenic language," and (b) what he saw as the
"poetic value" of what Herbeck had written. Subsequently, each time Navratil
met with Herbeck, he would give Herbeck a small sheet of Bristol-board and a
pen and, prompting him with a title, request that he write a poem.

In this way, over the next thirty years, Ernst Herbeck wrote more than a
thousand poems. When Navratil asked Herbeck what he thought of poetry,
Herbeck responded that it was merely something "momentary"--and, although
many of the poems were published in Herbeck's lifetime (and were apparently
well received), Herbeck never wrote spontaneously--only at Navratil's
prompting. He never revised a word. His poems were written quickly, for an
audience of one.

Die Gegenwart

Die Gegenwart is still allein,
wir wollen doch nur frohlich sein.
Ich bin gegangen in den Wald,
und kehre zurucke allzubald.

The Present

The present is aligned tho still alien
to anyone already content.
I'm going further into my antlers
and will return, baldly trumped.

* * *

Die Vergangenheit

die Vergangenheit ist klar vorbei
Voruber diese Zeit der Ewigkeit
Und nun bist du wieder ein Osterei.

The Past

The past is clearly over
passé as the Times or an ear
now bent on an Easter egg.

Little Review: Jeff Derksen, Transnational Muscle Cars
Talonbooks
0-88922-473-0

Derksen likes to position his poetry right in the mainstream of the saltier,
sparring realms of “political discourse,” his lines surfacing from the same
semantic gumbo that produced Spiro Agniew’s “nattering nabobs of negativism”
and Oscar Wilde’s whipsmart butlers getting one over on their narcissistic,
hidebound masters. A spirit of paradox lurks behind the arras of Derksen’s
lava-paced comedic discharge: “From agitprop to diamat / I believe it was
Tatlin / who said — or was it Jacques Villeneuve: / Learn to make leisure /
more work, rumours over tumours, / strategies over tactics. I stand / before
you asking to be memorable / for my memorabilia and / symptomatic for my
mottoes / in these times when we are told / that movement is what we all
share / it’s just that some have more legroom.” (98) 1996’s Dwell began the
exploration of a style that would become linked with Derksen: poems of
spare, astute “socialist one-liners” (his own phrase) that accrued sentence
by sentence to elaborate a complex field of issues, mostly concerning
geopolitics and nationalism but also sexuality, culture and class identity.
The mode departed from earlier varieties of “Language” poetics – such as
those espoused by Barrett Watten, Bruce Andrews or the “new sentence” of Ron
Silliman — by not fetishizing opaque formalisms over (or in place of)
“content”: Dwell was, even for the newbie, accessible in themes, comfortably
paced, and motored by an anti-heroic punk sensibility that jived with the
author’s working class background in Vancouver, Canada. Transnational Muscle
Cars, his third full-length collection, doesn’t add greatly to the poet’s
arsenal of poetic methods — the title poem, “Social Facts are Vertical” and
“But Could I Make a Living From It” could be extensions of poems from Dwell,
and indeed of each other — though “Jobber” and the stanzas of “Forced
Thoughts” (which read at times like decidedly un-Juba-to-Jived Harryette
Mullen quatrains) reflect a confidence in extending his methods into longer
works. There is a noticeable increase in the language of globalism — focus
on the “specific,” especially brand names, is valorized, as a gumbo of
capitalist detritus is depicted as links in a chain of transnational
correspondences (“I want to see / the real relations / but you’ve got Nikes
on and I like you / so I have to try and understand”) [10], while abstract
terms are rendered material, humanized so as to be subjected to warm satire:
“I’d like to inflate a bubble building as a mobil public sphere, but I’m a
little breathless.” (106) Derksen quirps in “Social Facts are Vertical”: “I
questioned authority and the question won,” a characteristically
self-effacing remark that takes the “self” as both identity trace and
Cartesian burden, but exhibiting a note of frustration with the language of
theory itself as a wieldable force of opposition. But Derksen has turned
this question into incredibly effective, lively but careful, Brechtian
poetry that turns the event of reading into a hootenanny in the village
square, and has already been quite influential on other writers creating
bridges between radical formalism and a vaudevillian social platform, such
as Kevin Davies, Rodrigo Toscano and Tim Davis.

before flintlock ignition

In 1599 the London grocers formed the East India Company (the Honourable
Company)

Pepper was at the bottom of the British Empire
(Oil is at the bottom of the American Empire)

the explosive heat of this commodity [pepper] communicated itself to its
peppery english purveyors
(the explosive heat of this commodity [oil, that silly sediment]
communicates itself to its oily american consumers)

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the Omanis themselves had a bad
reputation for piracy

By 1800 Muscat was almost exclusively a port of transit between India and
the Gulf

Captain Babcock, having been seen firing a musket, was condemned to lose an
arm which was struck off with a single blow of a sword. The Captain retained
sufficient presence of mind to thrust the profusely bleeding stump of his
arm into a pot of hot ghee [...] which lessened the flow of blood, as his
captors had taken no interest in preventing his bleeding to death

When Sir John Malcolm, the future Governor of Bombay, inquired of his Arab
servant Khudadad as to who were the inhabitants of this barren shore of
Arabia, he was told with apparent alarm

They are of the sect of the Wahhabis, and are called Jouassimee [Qawasimi];
but God preserve us from them, for they are monsters. Their occupation is
piracy, and their delight murder, and to make it worse they give you the
most pious reasons for every villainy they commit. They abide by the letter
of the sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and traditions. If you are
their captive and offer all to save your life, they say 'No! It is written
in the Koran that it is unlawful to plunder the living, but we are not
prohibited in that sacred work from stripping the dead'; so saying they
knock you on the head.

[...]they 'plundered their way to heaven' [and they] actually received
support from 'the wavering and infatuated policy of the Bombay Government',
then represented by the East India Company, who absurdly regarded these
murderous ruffians [terrorists] as 'innocent and unoffending Arabs [Saudis]'
and tied the hands of their naval officers with peremptory orders not to
fire on any arab craft until they first opened fire. [...] the bloodthirsty
pirates [...] construed non-intervention an avowal of weakness.

pirate excesses

Then under 'circumstances of horrid solemnity which gave the deed the
appearance of some hellish religious rite' the severely wounded captain was
literally hewed to pieces on the quarter deck. While the individual
passengers and crew members were bound and 'led forward singly, their heads
placed on the gunwale, and their throats cut with the exclamation used in
battle, "Allah Akbar"'.

provoked a reversal in the absurd, tender consciences of the East India
Company's Directors

the chief Qawasimi capital of Ras al-Khaimah [one of the seven emirates of
the United Arab Emirates] was bombarded and razed to the ground

This was far from being the end of the Sultan's [of Oman] troubles with the
piratical Wahhabis

By 1812, despite a general decline of Wahhabi fortunes which reached their
nadir in 1813 when Ibrahim Pasha drove Abdullah bin Saud out of Hijaz, Arab
corsairs [terrorists] were as busy as ever

[...] one Rahma bin Jaubir, the very type of the 'Barbary pirate' of
fiction: he had the capture of entire fleets to his credit, he gave no
quarter, slaughtering whole crews, he wore nothing but a shirt which he had
never changed or washed, his body and face were a mass of disfiguring scars.
The bones of his left arm had been shattered by grape-shot and having worked
out through the flesh, had left him with a boneless arm with which, however,
he took great pleasure in cutting throats.

[...] Wahhabism [...] a kind of licence to turn pirate [terrorist]

(Once in the junk souk of Riyadh I witnessed a religious policeman (the
tell-tale short dish-dash robe marking him) holding what looked like the
fanbelt from a car threateningly weilding it to make sure the shops were
closing during the afternoon prayer. He had very black skin, probably a
former slave, which was finally outlawed in the Kingdom in 1963.)

Statement on asondheim.org/portal/*.exe for Lewis LaCook


The programs are operating in the space between analog and digital,
although totally grounded in the digital. How much can mathesis transform
semantics? All of them except for bee.exe are determined and therefore the
metaphorical application of the machinic to the world.

The code is simply vb-wise and somewhat complex in terms of nesting and
recursion. I tend to work well with trignometric functions, which near the
limits, say, of tangent and cotangent, can resonate with the limits of the
computation itself.

Furthermore these images are interpreted in terms of the underlying
photographs - a lichen-like growth upon them, empathetic and cohering.
In turn, they modify, deconstruct.

What are they deconstructing? Language, meaning, symbols, the symbolic.
Through erasure and the growth of form.

Matt,
In your piece, you wrote:
"(Oil is at the bottom of the American Empire)"=20

And you miss a critical point.  Allow me to correct your error by =
adjusting your sentence:

"England is at the bottom of the American Empire." =20

And, in truth, Matt, England is at the bottom of the troubles in the =
Middle East. =20

Imagine how the English would react were a foreign nation to plunder a =
portion of the land around Liverpool, say carve out a parcel of land =
large enough to represent an Israel, and suppose that foreign nation, =
who assisted the incoming, new residents to win the early wars with the =
locals Brits, then used its influence to talk America into arming, =
training and continuing to fund the military of the newly arrived =
residents.  How might Mr. Blair react to that scenario? =20

The Israeli's since 1948, with the aid and arms from Britain and its =
allies (most notably the then pointedly Christian U.S.A.) have won =
fourteen wars (14) against their Arab neighbors...and still they have no =
peace.  Nor will there be peace so long as there is an imposed British =
(American) intervention into the daily lives of the people who populate =
the lands.=20

And I should clarify this point, America (nee GWBush) is not a culprit =
in this crime; the limp-minded eli has been a pawn in the British game, =
again.=20

My problem with the situation is simply this: neither GWB  nor his tribe =
of followers has the intellectual perspicacity  to recognize the fact =
that they've been played.  That, in my estimation is a fine feather in =
the hat of Mr. Blair and the British government.  Here, once again, the =
Brits have managed to take a losing hand and trade it for a winner by =
duping a silly, egotistical youngster of a country. =20

"Will there ever be a real peace in the Middle East," you ask?=20

Ask this while you are asking: "Will there be peace in Ireland?"=20

If you are a graduate of an English or an American school system and =
have failed to think beyond the details presented in your degree =
program, you will answer those questions by saying something like, =
"There will be peace in the region as soon as all factions learn to =
accept the dictates of the American (nee British) plan." =20

And at that statement, you'd be as wrong as your predecessors who have =
uttered similar words. =20

"So, Alex," you ask, "how should peace be pursued in the region?" =20

Dear List:
I'm going to be in Eugene, OR mid-October and wd like to set up a
reading (or talk) from my books. If you have any suggestions for the
area (I guess Salem and Corvallis aren't far away), aside from the U.
of Oregon's bookstore, I'd appreciate it. Back-channel's o.k. Thanks,

Dear Friends,

I'm inordinately pleased to announce the first in a
series of House Readings, in the fine local tradition
recently re-established by David Hadbawnik's friday
night reading series. Only this time it's in Oakland.

Well, the first reading is in Oakland but expect a
reading in a living room near you soon: namely, kari
edward's house in San Francisco and Taylor Brady's new
east bay location, later this fall. More will be
revealed.

The details? You are invited to come eat, drink, chat
and listen to poetry from Catherine Meng, Chris
Daniels, and, visiting from St. Louis: David Hess!

next Wednesday, August 20, readings to begin at 7:30

at Stephanie Young's house
434 36th Street
Oakland, 94609
(directions below)

Please bring a snack or something to drink. I'm going
to make pie. And ice cream.

THE READERS:

Catherine Meng is an east coast ex-pat who has been
living & writing in Berkeley for the past 3 years
after time in both Montana and New Mexico.  She has a
strong sense of spatial awareness but is very poor at
math.

Chris Daniels was born in 1956 in NYC and moved to the
Bay Area in 1981. His translations of lusophone poetry
have appeared in many literary journals. "On the
Shining Screen of the Eyelids," published by Manifest
Press, is his first book of translations.

David Hess graduated from St. Louis University High
School in 1992. He attended Brown University where he
met many poets and wrote many poems. He's had poems,
essays and reviews published in such magazines as
Jacket, Mungo vs. Ranger, Skanky Possum, Flashpoint,
Shampoo, Quid, The Baffler and VeRT. David has worked
many jobs. Some may be familiar with his editorship at
Ladue News=92 now defunct monthly insert Gentlemen=92s
Club. If you=92re not, you don=92t know what you were
missing. As far as poetry goes, David continues to
write it despite the pain it causes him and others. He
once described his poetic style as =93a punk Wallace
Stevens=94 and his criticism as =93Hans Gadamer on acid.=94
Skanky Possum, out of Austin, TX, published a
chapbook, Cage Dances, in 2001. In January 2003 David
started a weblog =96 =93Heathens in Heat=94 =96 where he
routinely posts writing, commentary and
expletive-laced digressions on the nature of mortal
existence.

DIRECTIONS TO STEPHANIE'S HOUSE:

I'm located at 434 36th Street, in Oakland. 36th
Street runs parallel to MacArthur Blvd. and between
Broadway and Telegraph Ave.

If you are driving from the city, I strongly suggest
you plug my address into Mapquest (www.mapquest.com)
or contact me directly and I can deluge you with
paragraphs of instructions.

For those of you coming via public transit, MacArthur
BART is the closest. You can walk to my house from
there. As you exit the BART station, walk through the
parking lot and out the back right hand side. You'll
exit onto Telegraph Ave. and the next light will be
MacArthur Blvd. Continue up Telegraph, through the
light, and then cross to the other side of the street.
36th St. will be your second left. Walk up 36th. I am
towards the top of the street, on the left hand side.
The house is white / off white.

IMPORTANT: I am the lower flat. Walk up the driveway -
you'll see a garage in the back with a scary-silly
blue puppet face. You'll also see my white honda
civic.
The door is up the driveway on the left hand side.
I'll have a sign posted near the street pointing you
my way.

If all else fails: the phone # is 510-428-9584

Hope to see you there!
Stephanie

Newark shaken by the loss of selfless role model

Shani Baraka was the quiet star of city's prominent family


Thursday, August 14, 2003


BY BARRY CARTER AND JEFFERY C. MAYS
Star-Ledger Staff


Amiri Baraka is a nationally recognized poet and social activist who
was one of the leading voices of the black power and black arts
movement of the 1960s and'70s.

His son, Ras Baraka, followed in his footsteps, becoming active in
Newark city issues, reciting his poetry on Lauryn Hill's debut album
and, more recently, on the nationally televised Def Poetry Jam.
 From our Advertisers



Amiri Baraka's daughter, Shani Baraka, went about things in a quieter
way.

A math and science teacher at Vailsburg Middle School and assistant
basketball coach at Malcolm X Shabazz High School, she upheld the
family tradition of reaching out to young people.

Shani Baraka, 31, and her friend Rayshon Holmes, 30, of Irvington were
found shot dead Tuesday in the family room of the Piscataway home of
Shani Baraka's sister.

In Newark, word of Shani Baraka's death hit hard.

"We are hurting because this family is such an important part of the
Newark community," said Mayor Sharpe James, who was visibly distraught.

"The Baraka family have been activists at articulating the concerns of
the people," said state Sen. Ronald Rice. "They've been in the
forefront of making government pay attention to certain issues."

By 10 a.m. yesterday, cars were doubled-parked in front of the home of
Amiri Baraka and his wife, Amina, on South 10th Street, a tree-lined
block in the city's South Ward.

A stream of close friends, family members, community activists and city
officials stopped by to express condolences. On the street outside the
house there were hugs and tears as people remembered the young woman.

"Everybody loved Shani," said a teary-eyed Ras Baraka, her brother and
a deputy mayor in Newark. "She was the best one out of all of us."

"Shani was so full of life," Amiri Baraka said. "This is inconceivable."

One visitor was Newark School Superintendent Marion A. Bolden, who
hugged Ras Baraka.

"This hurts personally because Shani's such a sweet person. She was one
of us. She went to school here and came back after college to teach,
coach and be a role model for our children," said Bolden.

Rep. Donald Payne (D-10th Dist.), said, "She was always cheerful and
she kept a smile on her face."

Community activist Patrick Council called Shani Baraka's death "a
definite loss to the community, especially to the women in the
community.

"She was a good spirit. She was high-energy," Council said. "That's the
kind of stuff the community needed. And she demanded it (energy) back.
She always wanted you to feel like she felt."

Shani Baraka was a top student-athlete at Johnson C. Smith University
in Charlotte, N.C. She was an outstanding basketball point guard, once
named co-player of the year by the Central Intercollegiate Athletic
Association. She graduated summa cum laude in 1994.

Friends and family said that even though Shani Baraka was 5-foot-1, she
was a tough, feisty and quick all-around guard with a nice jump shot,
who didn't like to lose.

"She was a tough player who didn't back down from anybody," said
Valerie Barnes, head girls basketball coach at University High School
in Newark and Shani Baraka's high school coach.

Shani got her start in coaching at University High School under Barnes.
She had aspirations to be a head coach and moved to Shabazz High
School, a larger basketball program, where she was assistant coach for
the past three years. Last year the team, which won the state
Tournament of Champions, was recognized as one of the best girls teams
in the nation.

Ras Baraka said Shani was enrolled at Saint Peter's College in Jersey
City and was one year away from completing her master's in
administration and supervision. With those credentials, colleagues
said, Shani could have become a vice principal or an athletic director,
although she liked to coach.

"She was just in her prime," Ras said. "She was trying to buy a house.
She was 30 years old. She was trying to begin to make stuff happen in
her life."

Shani was already making things happen with her Vailsburg students and
the players at Shabazz.

"She always said: 'Discipline, basketball, life,'" said Princess
Porter, a member of the Shabazz Lady Bulldogs championship team, who
will attend the University of the District of Columbia in the fall.

"She told us that if we are going to be tough on the basketball court,
we had to be tough in life," she said.

Beyond being an assistant coach, Shani Baraka was the go-to person when
the players needed someone to talk to.

Her players said she kept in touch with their problems, and she knew
the finer details of their lives, including their birthdays.

"She was always there," said Jamillah White, 16, a junior.

Last Friday, Shani Baraka came to Jamillah's side at a funeral for her
cousin, who had been shot eight times.

It was the last time they spoke, Jamillah said.

Recently, Shani Baraka coached the Newark girls basketball team to a
gold medal in the U.S. Youth Games in San Francisco. In the past,
Baraka had served as an assistant coach. "This year, Shani coached the
team herself ... and she brought the gold medal home," James said.

Porter said she will dedicate the rest of her basketball career to her
assistant coach.

"She always said there was more to life than basketball," Porter said.
"Every time I play, I'm going to remember my coach because she had such
an impact on my life."

Shani's death wasn't the first time that violence hit the Baraka family.

Amiri Baraka's sister, actress and dancer Kimako Baraka, was stabbed to
death in 1984 by a vagrant she tried to help.

"My sister and my daughter were killed by crazy men who hate women,"
Amiri Baraka said.

Coleman is the estranged husband of Wanda Pasha, Shani Baraka's sister. =
Coleman was not called a suspect.

      Amiri Baraka, the former poet laureate, said Wanda Pasha made =
several domestic violence complaints against Coleman, from whom she =
separated in February. He said Wanda Pasha was in Las Vegas at the time =
of the shootings.

      Kaplan said Coleman was not served with two complaints and has =
been considered a fugitive since July.

      Amiri Baraka's post as poet laureate was eliminated last month =
after he wrote a poem suggesting that Israel had advance knowledge of =
the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Investigators do not believe =
the uproar over the poem had anything to do with the shootings.

The theme of Fulcrum's third issue, to appear in early 2004, is
"DIAGNOSIS: POETRY (Poetry, Psychology, Psychiatry)." We would like to
clarify that this thematic constraint primarily concerns ESSAYS rather
than poems. Many (though not all!) of the essays in the issue will
explore the psychological and psychiatric dimensions, circumstances,
aspects, contexts, etc. of poetry. We especially welcome essays by
psychologists, psychiatrists and cognitive scientists who wish to
discuss poets and poetry from this particular angle.

We will also consider other essays on poetry. If you have an essay in
mind or in hand but are not sure whether it fits the issue's editorial
needs, please don't hesitate to query (or simply send it along). Any
suggestions and recommendations are also most welcome.

Poetry submissions are not expected to follow any specific theme. Simply
send us your best work!

Fulcrum normally reads unsolicited submissions June through August only,
but this year we have extended the reading period through September.

Send submissions of poetry and essays to:

Philip Nikolayev & Katia Kapovich, eds.
Fulcrum Annual
334 Harvard Street, Suite D-2

e-mail editor@fulcrumpoetry.com (queries only)

Please include a brief cover letter and SAE with sufficient postage
(postal stamps or IRCs). We regret being unable to accept unsolicited

Reading an issue of Fulcrum before submitting work is highly
RECOMMENDED.

>RESISTANCE: THE ORIGIN OF BLACK AUGUST
>Black August originated in the California penal system to honor fallen
>Freedom Fighters, Jonathan Jackson, George Jackson, William Christmas,
>James
>McClain and Khatari Gaulden. Jonathan Jackson was gunned down outside the
>Marin County California courthouse on August 7, 1970 as he attempted to
>liberate three imprisoned Black Liberation Fighters: James McClain, William
>Christmas and Ruchell Magee. Ruchell Magee is the sole survivor of that
>armed
>liberation attempt. He is the former co-defendant of Angela Davis and has
>been locked down for 38 years, most of it in solitary confinement. George
>Jackson was assassinated by prison guards during a Black prison rebellion
>at
>San Quentin on August 21, 1971. Three prison guards were also killed during
>that rebellion and prison officials charged six Black and Latino prisoners
>with the death of those guards. These six brothers became known as the San
>Quentin Six.
>
>Khatari Gaulden was a prominent leader of the Black Guerilla Family (BGF)
>after Comrade George was assassinated. Khatari was a leading force in the
>formation of Black August, particularly its historical and ideological
>foundations. Khatari, like many of the unnamed freedom fighters of the BGF
>and the revolutionary prison movement of the 1970's, was murdered at San
>Quentin Prison in 1978 to eliminate his leadership and destroy the
>resistance
>movement.
>
>The brothers who participated in the collective founding of Black August
>wore
>black armbands on their left arm and studied revolutionary works, focusing
>on
>the works of George Jackson. The brothers did not listen to the radio or
>watch television in August. Additionally, they didn't eat or drink anything
>from sun-up to sundown; and loud and boastful behavior was not allowed. The
>brothers did not support the prison's canteen. The use of drugs and
>alcoholic
>beverages was prohibited and the brothers held daily exercises, because
>during Black August, emphasis is placed on sacrifice, fortitude and
>discipline. Black August is a time to embrace the principles of unity,
>self-
>sacrifice, political education, physical training and resistance.
>In the late 1970's the observance and practice of Black August left the
>prisons of California and began being practiced by Black/New Afrikan
>revolutionaries throughout the country. Members of the New Afrikan
>Independence Movement (NAIM) began practicing and spreading Black August
>during this period. The Malcolm X Grassroots Movement (MXGM) inherited
>knowledge and practice of Black August from its parent organization, the
>New
>Afrikan People's Organization (NAPO). MXGM through the Black August
>Collective (now defunct) began introducing the Hip-Hop community to Black
>August in the late 1990's after being inspired by New Afrikan political
>exile
>Nehanda Abiodun.
>Traditionally, Black August is a time to study history, particularly our
>history in the North American Empire. The first Afrikans were brought to
>Jamestown as slaves in August of 1619, so August is a month during which
>Blacks/New Afrikans can reflect on our current situation and our self-
>determining rights. Many have done that in their respective time periods.
>In
>1843, Henry Highland Garnett called a general slave strike on August 22.
>The
>Underground Railroad was started on August 2, 1850. The March on Washington
>occurred in August of 1963, Gabriel Prosser's 1800 slave rebellion occurred
>on August 30 and Nat Turner planned and executed a slave rebellion that
>commenced on August 21, 1831. The Watts rebellions were in August of 1965.
>On
>August 18, 1971 the Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika
>(RNA) was raided by Mississippi police and FBI agents. The MOVE family was
>bombed by Philadelphia police on August 8, 1978. Further, August is a time
>of
>birth. Dr. Mutulu Shakur (political prisoner & prisoner of war), Pan-
>Africanist Black Nationalist Leader Marcus Garvey, Maroon Russell Shoatz
>(political prisoner) and Chicago BPP Chairman Fred Hampton were born in
>August. August is also a time of rebirth, W.E.B. Dubois died in Ghana on
>August 27, 1963.
>The tradition of fasting during Black August teaches self-discipline. A
>conscious fast is in effect from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm. Some other personal
>sacrifice can be made as well. The sundown meal is traditionally shared
>whenever possible among comrades. On August 31, a People's feast is held
>and
>the fast is broken. Black August fasting should serve as a constant

>of the conditions our people have faced and still confront. Fasting is
>uncomfortable at times, but it is helpful to remember all those who have

gratefully give the body,
you on the streets,
tongues in the middle

up to your neck

come back

intimate pauper silence
that dug under
spousal vindications

the first brains that

take it to make it
notes concentrated on business

I could not,

ripening without me!

gratefulness remains
to ask much of its grace,
ask if an implausible blustering
title warrants powerless feelings,
History's now my errand,

to air grievances
no one could replace assent
snares hurried
to ocean-blued shipments

And I just sat around watching national and local coverage -- not writing
such a wonderful poem -- from my perch near Niagara Falls, NY where,
folks, the sun shone brightly today and no lightening struck, despite
what PM Chretian said.

Gesso, or some swung impact,

Sure, I thought you were some twisted

Don't use the word, "nude,"

granite arms and army grains: Swell,
a parable and a paradiddle, or not a good day poem in disguise and 4/4 time.

1.  as regards legal man, track 11, track 7, hyperballad, the transplants
july 4th into 5th on a plane, a westjet going east, an anime episode then
some chess against Alekhine on the computer.

A carven image of craven history shields a dear Michael, this is as much a
letter to you as it is what it looks like I'm writing, in the air between
Toronto and Calgary again, in flight, I wish you could see how beautiful she
looks asleep against the black sky--- the volume falls down, the brightness
down, engage not so much like electricity but more agate per kilometer,
closes and closer than, if there is some mathematical symbol for
the sound of your voice, the timbre, the time you whispered "as you like it"
on stage, a
staged hedge, the way it dreams on high, wah this year looks up, or will,
and it'll be the first time in about three years that I've swam in a yard
(substitute squirmed at will), and the Toronto airport ban on planes landing
prior to 6:30AM reminds me that airplanes would shake my grandmother's
apartment in rexdale when I was younger and she was alive, that we're still
climbing, again and again and (she was a racist) again, that's the longpoem
when you've gathered it, a near miss understood for its clasped hands as a
flight attendant.

When she stands, when she isn't asleep, you should see her smile, it's four
o'clock in the morning, Toronto time, I'm going straight to a cottage, not a
cabin and I'm going to need some breakfast before the sun fully rises,
before noontide! a dance, dense food ridden moon, hidden behind 'do many
words', I mean clouds man.

it is certain that I wander weak and weary, however, the fact is our captain
is in near complete control, we still can't figure out how to master the
weather and for that it will always stand as some sort of paragon outside,
on the horizon, beyond capital, at its whim.
in a bottle, rain in a can, water at your command, c:\weatherinvaneornot,
given, graven,  in craven, the blackest of windows can't bird anymore, it is
a canvas, our eyelids only a temporary rose coloured boundary.

even if we don't see, there, patchwork Saskatchewan I'm wading for under my
mettle.

sun blue eastside, posh, ain't it, not a poetics of frushtration or a
frustrated poetics, come with me, my love, to the sea, the sea of love, it
moves me, to the loo, see, a dancing alphabet, and an alphabetic dance, some
diseased pretzels of language salted for your pleasure, but no wind in the
can can line, can't be broken.

if time is in fact a tidal force, then I can certainly feel it wrapped
around my temples and pulling me back, my head screams in planes.

that our words will have to change once we're eastern again, I'm not aware
that I say Cal-gary now instead of Calgry, that I say Toe-Ron-Toe instead of
Traaanah, her eyebrows move in her sleep, stampede.

dreams, pancakes and steers by Dr. Clark hiself, oh, clouds reform with
light edges on one side, the other partially unborne at this early hour,
sirens, time for sleeptime for less. a lucky banner wavers, worn through
fatigue, eaten drum solos, frail lift of voice through, through, a poetics
through, tunnels and channels, tsinor, not a network, a knot even oddly, an
illuminated network, no, friends, not even a mast to be tied against this
high, there is not a larger audience, rocks, or else as passengers, we
pretend to keep certain illustrations, it doesn't matter to the guy in the
seat in front of me whether or not I'm writing this poem or playing chess,
nothing will change this quickly, if it does, then it is most likely as
oppressive, television and film, video games, computers, it gets me down,
that gets me down, dear Michael, delirious thoughts to you this moonlit
early morning from a plane somewhere between Calgary and Toronto, over the
praries, maybe my friends jill an
 d paul in Manitoba, but I must sleep and will write more, soon.



Part 2, area glories (stands in for beautiful sounding nonsense):  a
farewell transmission in reverse

still in a both ears
a balanced s wing

feet step stop stomp

that fall in Japanese
during an other episode

we put ourselves into land
gears go down and click

furrowed, fallowed
were you followed?

into and out of that small door
a window on a plane

a sh fault
look out

red sun morn
have been warned

sometimes it is easier
to just pretend it jumps

around the horizon
it's easier that way, the sun

tired eyes break fast for a smile
it is still four in the am

through the machine's gears the oil
I am the noise on the stairs

a net do not stir in your sleep
some swelter

heat waves
and a biplane

what would be a trip
into interior BC for a salmon's arm?

have we descended?  some nude and
some stairs? some cases? down in planes, a

crumble backwise for wards, a front
tremble in the pairs, tremulous slide

guitar, lap steel, Milton forged punctuation
as/on the might of industry, demonstrates:

the irrelevant pond downtown, a,
an empty center, a show, left
for posterity, to humour what
got us that far a(ny)way.
there used to be a dog food plant
somewhere across the street
from Mill Pond where those
new condos went up.  and it used
to reek, to turn my stomach when-
ever we went to get scott's chicken.

there was this time when I was a kid
that a monster, some inflated plastic
thing rose out of the pond to the delight
and terror of Milton's inhabitants.  in
hindsight, this is a significant point---

the monster of a past industry, an
industry which sustained a community,
risen in its empty, plastic rage as a spectre,
aged into foolishness against the new steel
factories glistening near the railroad tracks.

b)  never really asleep, no one gets it right.
real truth, a golden apple, bring the bough
down under, into the shade of its own bulk.

corpuscle, mapped fat, rendered capital:
that all of our industry should only end
in an incredibly obese future.  progress

through your meal.  find gretel and get her
into a nice apron, barefoot and pregnant to

feed that hungry witch out the western window----
just between the clouds and whatever is above,

that thin line not quite blue or white, nor yellow,
just distance.  "the big star is fallen".  attendant, we

wait in the path of its decline.  needlessly busy
inventing arcs to pretend global warming
could actually be a natural phenomenon; a
recurring lapse to cleanse the planet, maybe.


3. writing through

writing through this most miserable human time
embarrassed and ashamed, not in the unborn eyes,
rather at the very fact of existing now.  changing

channels so easily, all at your leisure, not to suggest
hard work is preferable, more human, or natural, simply
that we've spoiled ourselves into perpetually spoiling.

caught in our own net woven from plastic, clouds and time.
dip it into the water, pull yourself out, and  blink.  look
around at the things you run out of when you forget to run.

the only writing possible is a writing through.  a  lake form
viewed from above, by plane, a shadow of grey on a uniform
off-whiteness.  rallied around the lowest point of gravity.  see

a 'you' there.  the great attractor is a sink hole.  heavy yet empty drain
where debris like you and I are swept along by a perpetual forward fall.
we call this turbulence, this momentary resistance, this flotsam we hold.

if we invent the game then it is impossible for us to lose.  illusion
breeds competition, in this case, for our share of the market.  such
a small and relatively empty center, a sinkhole for the country.  tried

tired.  switched and levered, ballast and gear.  be simple again, not
stupid,
gentle breeze, cabin pressure, automated response smile, nod, not stupid,
learned form, understood societal maintenance.  thank you for f)lying.



4.

check for frauds
in that line up above,
check it again.  frauds.
check frauds.  again,
cheak frads the bear
and kilt of Wyoming. get you out a
criminal garrote.  Grace.
Fraud.  thanks for the bike
 you leant me.  it got me home.
how do you know I told the truth?
it was a good question.  in that
line up above.  enque.  the ink you,
there.  the English language
has never been home.

diphthong fish on!  and
you caught your lure
in the trees above
where it stayed
for hundreds of years
in theory.

fish have maximized, swam up the rivers
into your veins.  epicarp.  I caught a pike.
two smallmouths and loads of jackfish.

b) hello va wonderment last evening with Barlow a Go!
eye scream for visual events sing twilight seen art
against the backdrop of eyes that and carnival a french
-esque insistence on the 'want' and 'to know' of 'the' person

can I count on you when it is night?

that moment between a day in Toronto
and friends in flight from Calgary

no one moves no one gets hurt honey
from heaven manna from Manitoba

always these poems in motion across
provinces or providences lines and byways

not a journal more a transcanadian map or
a pan- to wide angle some gold from the river

a tall can of high life on the way to the cottage
(not cabin) along the edge of dough lake a wallet

from the waves in the wake an optometrist's
SPECIAL DELIVERY in livery I liver or Y

not just a play with words what is the state

poetry could cut through not cut up or
randomized not egoless or as much as
a government anyway in turmoil again

in words as much as in Milton that flight from
a pinnacle said the view up and the view down

only a matter of perception what is the perceived
matter?  a universe of stars and rock and roll Calgary

Klein with a pie in his face and two in the bush
buds and bicycles last night at the paddock after

légèr streetcar away turbulent plane ride memory
bad times over wünderland into Toronto a golf

course view or else patchwork farms brown gold and green
what with all of this snow the summer harvest should swell

doesn't run down form any mountains in our area
here rivers run north and we still can't control rain

it is often said that in the case of a level 3 drought
the safest place to be is on a golf course, to find water

as unpredictable, this is what I would like to do today
sit at the window three flights above Dupont with the glass

panels opened into the room a slight breeze and cat across the road
Malika and Rudy hold slides up to the light of beautifully stitched canvas

lines gotten longer stitched all naturally from the left to the right
a tapestry tapped, mapped into the gridform on our left

bought the mc5 cd with kick out the jams on it yesterday
while Rudy shopped the boutiques for clothes

new gallery district called the distillery I guess
not enough to play my brothers and sisters for

curses and nurses not enough to just
settle into trickery or content yet

the sitcom of Canadian poetry remains
and the hour long drama of the university looms

literary magazine news programs litter the streets
with the only exceptions duly noted in an open letter

which must mean a C or L some would say U
regret it right and carry your laundry down the street

might not immediately make cements and dollars to boot

downtown isn't like any other nor
can it promise the same shade as one

say in my backyard in Milton or perhaps
the foliage around your native Ayr this Ontario

summer heat so unlike Calgary's dry stillness
cold breeze and hot sunshine down tempo

leaves tattooed on our skin by the sun, dark
patches mapped along your spine and thighs

down tempo camera angles a giant oak tree and the sky
over the red brick school house might fall one day

give me your hand, hold my head in your lap down tempo
rest your lips when they weary just here beside my mouth


4. just because

a several case of patio anxiety garnered chocolate enclosures as they melt.
in our pockets not in your mouth.  embrace from the photographer.  can I
count on you when it's time?


5. yesterday
it isn't so much the clock on my wrist that haunts me now.  more a sensation
of blood movement.  a round.  lift of the arms, and empty granite embrace
just under the loam.  surface hubris and peat sod, lawn, yard.  pull the
grass covers apart.  open into an intimate conversation between the bark on
the may tree back home (wherever that may be) and the oaks in high park.
graft poem to splice verbs under the moon skin.  wander away with water
falls or whiter clouds across a yellowed moon.  night flight, float along
star lake. games and honey, land of.  hate that it always sounds this way.


6. a belligerent, spell correction beatbox or fabricator

"Have a healthy mistrust today"  --- not me.



7. yesterday

best  friend empty arms.  the hole banks make.  fill it with tears and call
that a pond.  land torn asunder.  clean dirt from under your fingernails.
that dull machine ache inside your chest can make you still.  stir there,
and wait no longer for a shadow to ripen your eyelids.  it isn't dreams that
settle down through the street lights along Walmer. not this stormy July 15,
2003.  my mind full, thoughts rumble around your face, her face, my friend's
sadness.  a challenge of the forest and the terrible truth of the trees.
the ones we used to climb and leap from when we were smaller.  freefall at
the mirrored night sky. don't dream.  our world isn't empty enough just yet
to anticipate the echoes to justify such a loud voice.  not even today.



8. fake potatoes---  an msg song

poly saturday unsaturated math, eat well-cooked spatulas.  my face drains in
the summer months.  mostly necessitated by ragweed, pollen (often of a
poplar variety) or hay.


9. nobody moves nobody gets hurt


classic bidis in the Dupont afternoon heat.  traffic.  a kind of mumble over
the Stars disc.  mom calls because we need a ride home from the airport
tomorrow.  nine AM.



10.

next year's program won't happen all at once or in French at all.
Yevtushenko shouts clean mirrors at the summer television line ups.
transplants and trans factories.  contacts help you to see, a long list of
people you know.  forms your subdivision from the other cells, a mitosis of
urban plans, streets, cyto-, a migration into a several phase of casio
limnality, that is, stands for the words fuck you.  a burling.  or villa
from oak.  southwestern Ontario into a bleary day.  heat waves and distances
traveled.  books and boats to launch, maybe front the harbour and invest
some monkey into a district as empty as the historical intention of its
building.







11. white chocolate ache for breakfast with a side order of chips

this, MS word won't let me misnumber.  it changes my format to aid in
composition.  it isn't a new idea, but I think the hidden ghost writer of
the twenty-first century will be the word processing programs we use(d) to
write.  dear Michael, now your name, so what is it, who is close to god?
next to god?  baggage of advance, the progress of etymologies.  out the
door.  "fuck the fuckin backstabbin cunts".  make.  mismake me a garden that
doesn't tend.  currency should be served tender, medium, a cold medium,
well, rare, that rarity increases value.  pynchon in the subway system.
some current chutney.  could be called five or V: pubis and funnel down
drain way or valley; an insistence on mountains arises again, since valleys
imply or necessitate the presence of peaks as much as vice versa.  and both
negate a whole lifeline, animal web and scatter text.  there are these tiny
two or three feet tall trees about three thousand feet into the air that
have been alive for centuries
 on a mountain near Jasper.  you can see them from the road as an uneven
green horizontal line against the grey mount.  the sun, it never remembers.
and your ideologies aren't walls, the sky isn't perched to fall, don't go
and tell the king, rumourmonger.  not today.  maybe not today.  just like
any other.  deadalus' biplane but we always remember the descent of icarus
(which sounds a lot like a misplaced understanding of the message, not
necessarily don't fly to close to the sun.).  dear Michael, that these
things are not about you just written to you.

with love,

> Subject: Amiri Baraka's daughter murdered
>
> Newark shaken by the loss of selfless role model
>
> Shani Baraka was the quiet star of city's prominent family
>
>
> Thursday, August 14, 2003
>
>
> BY BARRY CARTER AND JEFFERY C. MAYS
> Star-Ledger Staff
>
>
> Amiri Baraka is a nationally recognized poet and social
> activist who was one of the leading voices of the black
> power and black arts movement of the 1960s and'70s.
>
> His son, Ras Baraka, followed in his footsteps, becoming
> active in Newark city issues, reciting his poetry on
> Lauryn Hill's debut album and, more recently, on the
> nationally televised Def Poetry Jam.
>  From our Advertisers
>
>
>
> Amiri Baraka's daughter, Shani Baraka, went about things
> in a quieter way.
>
> A math and science teacher at Vailsburg Middle School and
> assistant basketball coach at Malcolm X Shabazz High
> School, she upheld the family tradition of reaching out to
> young people.
>
> Shani Baraka, 31, and her friend Rayshon Holmes, 30, of
> Irvington were found shot dead Tuesday in the family room
> of the Piscataway home of Shani Baraka's sister.
>
> In Newark, word of Shani Baraka's death hit hard.
>
> "We are hurting because this family is such an important
> part of the Newark community," said Mayor Sharpe James,
> who was visibly distraught.
>
> "The Baraka family have been activists at articulating the
> concerns of the people," said state Sen. Ronald Rice.
> "They've been in the forefront of making government pay
> attention to certain issues."
>
> By 10 a.m. yesterday, cars were doubled-parked in front of
> the home of Amiri Baraka and his wife, Amina, on South
> 10th Street, a tree-lined block in the city's South Ward.
>
> A stream of close friends, family members, community
> activists and city officials stopped by to express
> condolences. On the street outside the house there were
> hugs and tears as people remembered the young woman.
>
> "Everybody loved Shani," said a teary-eyed Ras Baraka, her
> brother and a deputy mayor in Newark. "She was the best
> one out of all of us."
>
> "Shani was so full of life," Amiri Baraka said. "This is
> inconceivable."
>
> One visitor was Newark School Superintendent Marion A.
> Bolden, who hugged Ras Baraka.
>
> "This hurts personally because Shani's such a sweet
> person. She was one of us. She went to school here and
> came back after college to teach, coach and be a role
> model for our children," said Bolden.
>
> Rep. Donald Payne (D-10th Dist.), said, "She was always
> cheerful and she kept a smile on her face."
>
> Community activist Patrick Council called Shani Baraka's
> death "a definite loss to the community, especially to the
> women in the community.
>
> "She was a good spirit. She was high-energy," Council
> said. "That's the kind of stuff the community needed. And
> she demanded it (energy) back. She always wanted you to
> feel like she felt."
>
> Shani Baraka was a top student-athlete at Johnson C. Smith
> University in Charlotte, N.C. She was an outstanding
> basketball point guard, once named co-player of the year
> by the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association. She
> graduated summa cum laude in 1994.
>
> Friends and family said that even though Shani Baraka was
> 5-foot-1, she was a tough, feisty and quick all-around
> guard with a nice jump shot, who didn't like to lose.
>
> "She was a tough player who didn't back down from anybody
> ," said Valerie Barnes, head girls basketball coach at
> University High School in Newark and Shani Baraka's high
> school coach.
>
> Shani got her start in coaching at University High School
> under Barnes. She had aspirations to be a head coach and
> moved to Shabazz High School, a larger basketball program,
> where she was assistant coach for the past three years.
> Last year the team, which won the state Tournament of
> Champions, was recognized as one of the best girls teams
> in the nation.
>
> Ras Baraka said Shani was enrolled at Saint Peter's
> College in Jersey City and was one year away from
> completing her master's in administration and supervision.
> With those credentials, colleagues said, Shani could have
> become a vice principal or an athletic director, although
> she liked to coach.
>
> "She was just in her prime," Ras said. "She was trying to
> buy a house. She was 30 years old. She was trying to begin
> to make stuff happen in her life."
>
> Shani was already making things happen with her Vailsburg
> students and the players at Shabazz.
>
> "She always said: 'Discipline, basketball, life,'" said
> Princess Porter, a member of the Shabazz Lady Bulldogs
> championship team, who will attend the University of the
> District of Columbia in the fall.
>
> "She told us that if we are going to be tough on the
> basketball court, we had to be tough in life," she said.
>
> Beyond being an assistant coach, Shani Baraka was the
> go-to person when the players needed someone to talk to.
>
> Her players said she kept in touch with their problems,
> and she knew the finer details of their lives, including
> their birthdays.
>
> "She was always there," said Jamillah White, 16, a junior.
>
> Last Friday, Shani Baraka came to Jamillah's side at a
> funeral for her cousin, who had been shot eight times.
>
> It was the last time they spoke, Jamillah said.
>
> Recently, Shani Baraka coached the Newark girls basketball
> team to a gold medal in the U.S. Youth Games in San
> Francisco. In the past, Baraka had served as an assistant
> coach. "This year, Shani coached the team herself ... and
> she brought the gold medal home," James said.
>
> Porter said she will dedicate the rest of her basketball
> career to her assistant coach.
>
> "She always said there was more to life than basketball,"
> Porter said. "Every time I play, I'm going to remember my
> coach because she had such an impact on my life."
>
> Shani's death wasn't the first time that violence hit the
> Baraka family.
>
> Amiri Baraka's sister, actress and dancer Kimako Baraka,
> was stabbed to death in 1984 by a vagrant she tried to
> help.
>
> "My sister and my daughter were killed by crazy men who
> hate women," Amiri Baraka said.

> Subject: Fulcrum 3 theme CLARIFICATION + submission dates
>
> The theme of Fulcrum's third issue, to appear in early
> 2004, is "DIAGNOSIS: POETRY (Poetry, Psychology,
> Psychiatry)." We would like to clarify that this thematic
> constraint primarily concerns ESSAYS rather than poems.
> Many (though not all!) of the essays in the issue will
> explore the psychological and psychiatric dimensions,
> circumstances, aspects, contexts, etc. of poetry. We
> especially welcome essays by psychologists, psychiatrists
> and cognitive scientists who wish to discuss poets and
> poetry from this particular angle.
>
> We will also consider other essays on poetry. If you have
> an essay in mind or in hand but are not sure whether it
> fits the issue's editorial needs, please don't hesitate to
> query (or simply send it along). Any suggestions and
> recommendations are also most welcome.
>
> Poetry submissions are not expected to follow any specific
> theme. Simply send us your best work!
>
> Fulcrum normally reads unsolicited submissions June
> through August only, but this year we have extended the
> reading period through September.

We Had a Democracy Once, But You Crushed It
By Russell Mokhiber and Robert Weissman

In yesterday's Washington Post, Condoleeza Rice, the President's National
Security Advisor, writes the following:

"Our task is to work with those in the Middle East who seek progress
toward greater democracy, tolerance, prosperity and freedom. As
President Bush said in February, =91The world has a clear interest in the
spread of democratic values, because stable and free nations do not
breed ideologies of murder. They encourage the peaceful pursuit of a
better life.'"

Now, if we only had a nickel for every time Bush, or Rice, or Colin
Powell, or Paul Wolfowitz or Dick Cheney or Richard Perle or Donald
Rumsfeld talked about bringing democracy to the Middle East.

Talk, talk, talk.

Here's something you can bet on: Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz will not hold a
press conference this month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
U.S.-led coup of the democratically elected leader of Iran -- Mohammed Mossa=
degh.

Rice and Powell won't hold a press conference to celebrate Operation
Ajax, the CIA plot that overthrew the Mossadegh.

That was 50 years ago this month, in August 1953.

That's when Mossadegh was fed up with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company --
now BP -- pumping Iran's oil and shipping the profits back home to the
United Kingdom.

And Mossadegh said -- hey, this is our oil, I think we'll keep it.

And Winston Churchill said -- no you won't.

Mossadegh nationalized the company -- the way the British were
nationalizing their own vital industries at the time.

But what's good for the UK ain't good for Iran.

If you fly out of Dulles Airport in Virginia, ever wonder what the word
Dulles means?

It stands for the Dulles family -- Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
and his brother, the CIA director, Allen Dulles.

They were responsible for the overthrow of the democratically elected
leader of Iran.

As was President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Kermit Roosevelt, the
CIA agent who traveled to Iran to pull off the coup.

Now why should we be concerned about a coup that happened so far away
almost 50 years ago this month?

New York Times reporter Stephen Kinzer puts it this way:

"It is not far-fetched to draw a line from Operation Ajax through the
Shah's repressive regime and the Islamic revolution to the fireballs
that engulfed the World Trade Center in New York."

Kinzer has written a remarkable new book, All the Shah's Men: An
American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror (Wiley, 2003).

In it, he documents step by step, how Roosevelt, the Dulles boys and
Norman Schwarzkopf Sr., among a host of others, took down a
democratically elected regime in Iran.

They had freedom of the press. We shut it down.

They had democracy. And we crushed it.

Mossadegh was the beacon of hope for the Middle East.

If democracy were allowed to take hold in Iran, it probably would have
spread throughout the Middle East.

We asked Kinzer =96 what does the overthrow of Mossadegh say about the
United States respect for democracy abroad?

"Imagine today what it must sound like to Iranians to hear American
leaders tell them -- =91We want you to have a democracy in Iran, we
disapprove of your present government, we wish to help you bring
democracy to your country.' Naturally, they roll their eyes and say --
"We had a democracy once, but you crushed it,'" he said. "This shows how
differently other people perceive us from the way we perceive ourselves.
We think of ourselves as paladins of democracy. But actually, in Iran,
we destroyed the last democratic regime the country ever had and set
them on a road to what has been half a century of dictatorship."

After ousting Mossadegh, the United States put in place a brutal Shah
who destroyed dissent and tortured the dissenters.

And the Shah begat the Islamic revolution.

During that Islamic revolution in 1979, Iranians held up Mossadegh's
picture, telling the world  =96 we want a democratic regime that resists
foreign influence and respects the will of the Iranian people as
expressed through democratic institutions.

"They were never able to achieve that. And this has led many Iranians to
react very poignantly to my book," Kaizer told us. "One woman sent me an
e-mail that said =96 =91I was in tears when I finished your book because it
made me think of all we lost and all we could have had.'"

Of course, the overthrow of Mossadegh was only one of the first U.S.
coups of democratically elected regime. (To see one in movie form, pick
up a copy of Raoul Peck's Lumumba, now on DVD.)

Kinzer's previous books include Bitter Fruit: The Story of the American
Coup in Guatemala.

He's thinking of putting together a boxed set of his books on American coups=
.

Get copies of Bitter Fruit and All The Shah's Men.

Read them.

And the next time a politician talks about spreading democracy around
the globe, ask them about Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran, Patrice Lumumba in
the Congo, and Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala.

POWER OUTAGE TRACED TO DIM BULB IN WHITE HOUSE --- THE TALE OF THE BRITS WHO SWIPED 800 JOBS FROM NEW YORK, CARTED OFF $90 MILLION, THEN TONIGHT, TURNED OFF OUR LIGHTS
by Greg Palast
Palast is author of the New York Times bestseller, "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy" (Penguin USA) and the worstseller, "Democracy and Regulation," a guide to electricity deregulation published by the United Nations (with T. MacGregor and J. Oppenheim).



I can tell you all about the ne're-do-wells that put out our lights tonight. I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power Company -- some years back. You see, before I was a journalist, I worked for a living, as an investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s, "NiMo" built a nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally costly piece of hot junk for which NiMo and its partner companies charged billions to New York State's electricity ratepayers.

To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium fabricated cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job on the account books. In 1988, I showed a jury a memo from an executive from one partner, Long Island Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho on how to lie to government regulators. The jury ordered LILCO to pay $4.3 billion and, ultimately, put them out of business.

And that's why, if you're in the Northeast, you're reading this by candlelight tonight. Here's what happened. After LILCO was hammered by the law, after government regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens of other book-cooking, document-doctoring utility companies all over America with fines and penalties totaling in the tens of billions of dollars, the industry leaders got together to swear never to break the regulations again. Their plan was not to follow the rules, but to ELIMINATE the rules. They called it "deregulation."

It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make safecracking legal.

But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one devious little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas, operating under the alias "Enron," talked an over-the-edge free-market fanatic, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the first completely deregulated power plant in the hemisphere.

And so began an economic disease called "regulatory reform" that spread faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher's Energy Minister, one Lord Wakeham, with a bushel of dollar bills for 'consulting' services and a seat on Enron's board of directors. The English experiment proved the viability of Enron's new industrial formula: that the enthusiasm of politicians for deregulation was in direct proportion to the payola provided by power companies.

The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans wouldn't swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten used to cheap power available at the flick of switch. This was the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to be the last of the power pirates, Samuel Insull. Wall Street wheeler-dealer Insull creator of the Power Trust, and six decades before Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped off consumers. To frustrate Insull and his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal Power Commission and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act which told electricity companies where to stand and salute. Detailed regulations limited charges to real expenditures plus a government-set profit. The laws banned "power markets" and required companies to keep the lights on under threat of arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates.

Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed in repair and the lights stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire and, like me, crawled through the account books, to make sure the power execs spent customers' money on parts and labor. If they didn't, we'd whack'm over the head with our thick rule books. Did we get in the way of these businessmen's entrepreneurial spirit? Damn right we did.

Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility companies -- no 'soft' money, no 'hard' money, no money PERIOD.

But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure from the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one long deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of electricity. It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the gratitude of power companies which ponied up $16 million for the Republican campaign of 2000, seven times the sum they gave Democrats.

But Poppy Bush's gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the feds only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer. For the big payday they needed deregulation at the state level. There were only two states, California and Texas, big enough and Republican enough to put the electricity market con into operation.

California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a 1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nadar which would have blocked the de-reg scam. Another $37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating the campaign coffers of legislators to write a lie into law: in the deregulation act's preamble, the Legislature promised that deregulation would reduce electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when San Diegans in the first California city to go "lawless" looked at their bills, the 20% savings became a 300% jump in surcharges.

Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one life-time contributor to the George W. Bush campaign, it was confident about the future. With just a half dozen other companies it controlled at times 100% of the available power capacity needed to keep the Golden State lit. Their motto, "your money or your lights." Enron and its comrades played the system like a broken ATM machine, yanking out the bills. For example, in the shamelessly fixed "auctions" for electricity held by the state, Enron bid, in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts of electricity over a 15 megawatt line. That's like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble -- the lines would burn up if they attempted it. Faced with blackout because of Enron's destructive bid, the state was willing to pay anything to keep the lights on.

And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the California state Independent System Operator which directed power movements, between May and November 2000, three power giants physically or "economically" withheld power from the state and concocted enough false bids to cost the California customers over $6.2 billion in excess charges.

It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find his lost Democratic soul and impose price caps in California and ban Enron from the market.

But the light-bulb buccaneers didn't have to wait long to put their hooks back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving into the White House, while he was still sweeping out the inaugural champagne bottles, George Bush the Second reversed Clinton's executive order and put the power pirates back in business in California. Enron, Reliant (aka Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas Utilities) and the others who had economically snipped California's wires knew they could count on Dubya, who as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the richest deregulation deal in America.

Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners ripped the lid off electric bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara Mohawk of the expensive obligation to properly fund the maintenance of the grid system.

And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven: They allowed a foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National Grid of England, to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most of their wages - producing a bonus for NiMo stockholders approaching $90 million.

Is tonight's black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field who've watched Bush's buddies flick the switches across the globe. In Brazil, Houston Industries seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro's electric company. The Texans (aided by their French partners) fired workers, raised prices, cut maintenance expenditures and, CLICK! the juice went out so often the locals now call it, "Rio Dark."

So too the free-market cowboys of Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark Ages.

Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster: re-call the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to the electricity price fixers. And unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov. Gray Davis stood alone against the bad guys without using a body double. Davis called Reliant Corp of Houston a pack of "pirates" --and now he'll walk the plank for daring to stand up to the Texas marauders.

So where's the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing the foe that they used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for yet more electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there's no sense defeating Iraq if a hostile regime remains in California.

Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don't know if the truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the dim bulb in the White House.

do you see now how that trick line of the ghazal works
in English?

once the expectation is set up the audience is just
DYING to hear what the poet's going to say next.

sometimes at the reading the poet repeats the first
line over and over again like in a blues tune before
delivering the second line with the theme...

anyhow, non sequitur, but that's part of ghazal also.

Subject: PRESS RELEASE: Nottingham Trent teaches globally to make writing
    creative online

Most of us enjoyed writing at school but lost confidence in our teens when =
what was once a pleasurable pastime turned into a stressful academic chore.=
 Courses in creative writing can often provide a stimulus to rebuild that e=
arly enjoyment in writing, with positive spin-offs for both workplace and p=
ersonal creativity. But how do you attend a writing workshop when, like Tra=
cey Martin, you are based in a country like The Gambia where there are no s=
uch opportunities?

Tracey, 42, came to Africa from Thailand, where she worked as a teacher and=
 development manager. Now she is a Director of Voluntary Services Overseas =
and has settled in The Gambia with her Thai husband and their two children.=
  Keen to join a writing workshop but with none available locally, she thou=
ght of setting one up herself =96 until she discovered the trAce Online Wri=
ting School. Based at Nottingham Trent University in England but offering 1=
00% online courses on the web, the School is ideal for people like Tracey. =
She enjoyed the mix of nationalities in her Online Workshop, where one tuto=
r logged on from Bucketty, a small bush community in Hunter Valley, north o=
f Sydney, Australia, and  another from the suburbs of Nottingham, England:

=93I felt online I would be exposed to many more different types and attitu=
des to writing than if I was in a local group.=94

Working with trAce has opened her eyes to the possibilities:

=93It has motivated me to continue writing - I now know I can get things pu=
blished on the web and get feedback from all over the world. It has made me=
 want to learn more about the Internet and how it can help writers.=94

Uma Girish, 39, a freelance writer with eight years=92 experience and based=
 in Chennai, India, had the same response. She had heard about trAce via Th=
e British Council and was keen to try an online writing course to re-energi=
se her professional work:

=93I felt I might enjoy the comfort of working from home, reading work from=
 other cultures and backgrounds, and for the first time in my life, be tuto=
red by a foreigner!=94

Uma enjoyed the international variety of a group where the tutor was based =
in Newport Beach, California, and her fellow students logged on from variou=
s parts of the world:

=93I believe I brought a unique cultural perspective to the group, coming f=
rom India, as the others did to me. I like to share the story of the squirr=
els. In one of my written submissions, I had a phrase: 'timid as a squirrel=
', and a fellow writer in England simply didn't get it. He said squirrels a=
re bold, daring, and often march up to you and demand food from your lunch =
box if you happen to be sitting on a park bench. Where I come from, squirre=
ls are frightened creatures and bolt at the slightest noise from humans. So=
 this was an interesting, albeit small, cultural exchange.

=93The other thing the course did for me was to open the window to a much l=
arger world, in terms of ideas, writing styles, contexts and so forth. But =
there were barriers too. My fellow writers' references didn't always make s=
ense to me (as I'm sure mine didn't to them) especially when they wrote abo=
ut old-world traditions or used names to suggest a place or a certain kind =
of atmosphere. But that prompted an exchange because I asked for clarificat=
ions and they always obliged.=94

Bedfordshire-based Gavin Stewart, 41,  turned from an international career =
as a derivatives trader to studying for a PhD in computer-mediated textuali=
ty at the University of Luton. Studying at trAce was part of that change. H=
e says:

=93I was interested in the trAce format because the course tutor presents a=
 comprehensive package of coursework that provides a much-needed structure =
which facilitates one to 'take on' the challenge of a new way of working.=
=94

He has already created a small multi-participant work called 'Tomorrow' and=
  is currently producing a Multi-user Garden called 'The Castle Gardens' us=
ing PHP4.0 and SQL.

Gavin Stewart took Alan Sondheim=92s Experimental Writing course. Tracey Ma=
rtin attended the trAce Online Workshop which runs continuously with two tu=
tors at a starter fee of =A328 for four weeks. Uma Girish=92s course is not=
 available this year but there are thirteen others to choose from. The next=
 series of nine-week courses starts 15th September with Freelance Article W=
riting, Poetry, Children=92s Fiction, and Writing Crime and Mystery. Course=
s cost =A3140 and can be booked online at http://tracewritingschool.com

>From her freelancer=92s study in Chennai, Uma feels very much part of the =
global professional community. She reports:

=93I am very happy talking to a variety of editors from overseas magazines,=
 doing query letters, and believing that sitting here in India my writing c=
an make a difference to people a few continents away.=94

Walter Ong's book Orality and Literacy is one of my favorite books.

In Orality and Literacy, Walter Ong suggests that some well-known theories
of personal or cultural development explain changes that are "more cogently"
described as "shifts from orality to various stages of literacy":

"...shifts hitherto labelled as shifts from magic to science, or from the
so-called 'prelogical' to the more and more 'rational' state of
consciousness, or from Levi-Strauss's 'savage' mind to domesticated thought,
can be more economically and cogently explained as shifts from orality to
various stages of literacy."

It is almost a commonplace now to note that when we think we're measuring
intelligence, we're often measuring various forms of literacy.

McLuhan and Ong proposed that technologies are no mere add-ons to who and
what we are but, rather, alter us very much as though the technologies
really were extensions of us. We had seen, in science fiction, humankind
become machine, but McLuhan and Ong showed us the contemporary version amid
the day to day phenomenon of our mediated, technologized world--though they
posed it less as 'humankind become' as 'modified by' the technology.

Ong showed us noetic (cognitive) differences of perception, memory, and
priority that exist between oral and print-based cultures. His work showed
us a fascinating example of how perception, memory, and priorities might be
affected by as 'simple' a technology as print so that the story of the
technologizing of the word and the world became not a new and frightening
one, but a story with a great deal of history to it already. Also, the sorts
of cognitive and perceptual differences highlighted by Ong and Havelock
between cultures that used different technologies of the mind suggested we
might expect similar sorts of dramatic changes (or reversions) in culture as
a result of the adoption of new technologies of the mind. Insofar as these
technologies provide an environment for types of expression that would
otherwise not arise, "the medium is the message." McLuhan, Ong, Havelock and
others made us aware of this and it was surely a great contribution into the
nature of technology, history, and culture.

We tend to think of language and money, electronic media, and other
technologies as tools, but we tend to discount the degree to which our tools
determine who we are and what we do. Language itself is a technology, a
"tool" made by people. But the tool draws a circle around the realm of the
thinkable beyond which few can negotiate.

He was a tremendously inspiring thinker. I am very sad to hear of his death.

EXHIBITION NEWS

Not by the Book

Love and/or Terror Exhibition at UA Museum of Art

Triggered by the events and repercussions of 9/11, the University of Arizona
Museum of Art invited fifty artists to respond to the subjects of love
and/or terror in the form of a book. These amazing artists’ book will be on
view at the UA Museum of Art from August 3 ­ September 21, 2003.
Artists often assume the role of challenging commercial and conventional
forms of expression. The artists in the Love and/or Terror exhibition
experiment with our notions of what a book is. These books are made with
unexpected materials from handmade papers to feathers and fish scales. They
are not standard storybooks sandwiched between covers. There are flipbooks,
round books, books that stretch accordion-like for many feet and books that
are paperless. There are books without words, and books with one word. There
are books that do not open and books that do not end.
How these books are made and the stories they tell overlap. There are
intricately folded books about love and loss, digitized books about memory
and distance, hand-knitted books about the weather in Minnesota,
photographic books about biblical text,and flip books about kisses and
winks.

Visit the UA Museum of Art and spend some time with these artists’ books
that are definitely not by the book!

Where have you gone my darling young one?

KAN JI ZAI BO SATSU GYO JIN HAN NYA HA RA MIT TA JI SHO KEN GO
Avalokitesvara bodhisattva practice deep prajna paramita when perceive five
five and a dime feed me off this trough I have no place to slough off my

UN KAI KU DO ISSAI KU YAKU
skandas all empty. relieve every suffering.
to relieve the suffering is to find it with a round in his skull on your
parent's lawn

SHA RI SHI SHIKI FU I KU KU FU I SHIKI SHIKI
Sariputra, form not different (from) emptiness. Emptiness not different
(from) form. Form
is emptiness.  I feel it in my eye in my why in my I I feel it and I am
none.  Not to say nothing but yes.

SOKU ZE KU KU SOKU ZE SHIKE JU SO GYO SHIKI YAKU
is the emptiness. Emptiness is the form. Sensation, thought, active
substance, consciousness, also
to be concluded as a series of conclusions ever closer ever compressed on
conclusion after the next

BU NYO ZE
like this
or like something else something less

SHA RI SHI ZE SHO HO KU SO FU SHO FU METSU FU KU FU JO
Sariputra, this everything original character; not born, not annihilated not
tainted, not pure,
not dirty not tainted not empty but full of throb and semen and the juices
of cunnilingus on my chin I wash

FU ZO FU GEN ZE KO KU CHU MU SHIKI MU JU SO GYO
(does) not increase, (does) not decrease. Therefore in emptiness no form, no
sensation, thought, active substance,
substances active in my outside my I am nothing release me from this death I
have in my pocket

SHIKI MU GEN NI BI ZETS SHIN NI MU SHIKI SHO KO MI SOKU HO MU GEN
consciousness. No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind; no color, sound,
smell, taste, touch, object; no eye,
but two eyes and object between my legs I touch it you taste it this is
colored and exploitative and you open

KAI NAI SHI MU I SHIKI KAI MU MU MYO YAKU MU MU MYO
world of eyes until we come to also no world of consciousness; no ignorance,
also no ignorance
and we are stupid all of us and brilliant but like stars but millions of
light-years away saying welcome if you want to

JIN NAI SHI MU RO SHI YAKU MU RO SHI JIN MU KU SHU
annihilation, until we come to no old age, death, also no old age, death,
also no old age, death, annhilation of no suffering, cause of suffering,
and annihilation is the underpinning the growing meaning of our lives and so
we must come and so we must come to this

METSU DO MU CHI YAKU MU TOKU I MU SHO TOK KO BO DAI SAT TA E
nirvana, path; no wisdom, also no attainment because of no attainment.
Bodhisattva depends on
hatred and disdain of no disdain or hatred no it doesn't sound that way but
only in an above-it-all-and-in-it response

HAN NYA HA RA MIT TA KO SHIN MU KE GE MU KE GE KO MU U KU FU ON RI
prajna paramita because mind no obstacle. Because of no obstacle no exist
fear; go beyond
the five and dime where I was conceived on a discount rack set to use a
score for more this is less than a pile of words

I SSAI TEN DO MU SO KU GYO NE HAN SAN ZE SHO BUTSU E HAN
all (topsy-turvey views) attain Nirvana. Past, present and future every
Buddha depend on prajna
and extreme sports achievement cynically clipped into a realpolitik wholly
of another world in this one

NYA HA RA MIT TA KO TOKU A NOKU TA RA SAN MYAKU SAN BO DAI
paramita therefore attain supreme, perfect, enlightenment.
which is of course a punchline without a joke this is one hand clapping

August Highland has set about the task of changing everything
conventional about the publishing industry. To give a literary work the
same intrinsic material value as a painting, Highland conceived of the
"Massive Production" publishing model. Instead of producing one book and
selling thousands of copies of that book to readers, each one of whom
own a re-printed, disposable object, Highland produces thousands of
one-of-a-kind books and sells only the original copy of that book to one
person who then owns a work of art with the same intrinsic value of a
painting or sculpture.

Highland applies the same production ethic to "Alphanumeric Labs." Like
all the projects by the "Superheroes of Humanities" the visual work by
"Alphanumeric Labs" are literary works that have migrated across the
boundary line where literature morphs from text intended to be read
(library material) to text intended to be viewed (museum material).
Currently there are four series in the Howard Fineman Collection.
Highland has 20 series planned for "Alphanumeric Labs," each to contain
1,000 works. Individual works are professionally converted from a
digital art piece to a "painting" of monumental size. They are sold as
one-of-a-kind artworks for between $2,500 to $5,000.

BIOGRAPHY

August Highland is the Director of "Culture Animal," a literary
production company. "Culture Animal" presents tens of thousands of
literary works by August Highland under approximately 80 personae. This
conceptual literary performance is called "Metapoetics Theatre."
"Culture Animal" has developed over 30 projects, each with an individual
website. The work is presented by one or more personae who produce
literary work in a particular genre or subgenre originated by Highland
himself. All the personae of "Culture Animal" are members of one of
three simulated literary movements. They are the "Worldwide Literati
Mobilization Network, the "International Belles Lettres Federation" and
the "Superheroes of Humanities." The literary genres that August
Highland has originated are "Hyper-Literary Fiction," "Microlinear
Storytelling," "Next-Gen Nanopoetics," and "Genre-Splicing."

Highland is also Editor and Publisher of an online international
literary quarterly. The "Muse Apprentice Guild" first appeared online in
August, 2002. The premiere issue contained 60 writers and 100 literary
works. The Spring, 2003 issue of the M.A.G. presented over 4,000
literary works by 600 writers. The M.A.G. has 35 contributing editors or
"liaisons" around the world and is the Internet's largest and most
widely read international literary quarterly.

Wow, pretty big question but for starters take a look at Jamie Pennebaker's
page.
http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Faculty/Pennebaker/Home2000/JWPhome.
htm
 he's the big gun in the new research and some of his papers are online.

psybc may be doing something on it and I'll pass your request on to some
psych lists.

Power outage traced to dim bulb in White House
by Greg Palast

www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=15459


The tale of the Brits who swiped 800 jobs from New York, carted off $90
million, then tonight turned off our lights


Palast is author of the New York Times bestseller, "The Best Democracy Money
Can Buy" (Penguin USA) and the worstseller, "Democracy and Regulation," a
guide to electricity deregulation published by the United Nations (with T.
MacGregor and J. Oppenheim).

I can tell you all about the ne're-do-wells that put out our lights tonight.
I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power Company --
some years back. You see, before I was a journalist, I worked for a living,
as an investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s, "NiMo" built a
nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally costly piece of hot junk for
which NiMo and its partner companies charged billions to New York State's
electricity ratepayers.

To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium fabricated
cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job on the account
books. In 1988, I showed a jury a memo from an executive from one partner,
Long Island Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho on how to lie to
government regulators. The jury ordered LILCO to pay $4.3 billion and,
ultimately, put them out of business.

And that's why, if you're in the Northeast, you're reading this by
candlelight tonight. Here's what happened. After LILCO was hammered by the
law, after government regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens of other
book-cooking, document-doctoring utility companies all over America with
fines and penalties totaling in the tens of billions of dollars, the
industry leaders got together to swear never to break the regulations again.
Their plan was not to follow the rules, but to ELIMINATE the rules. They
called it "deregulation."

It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make
safecracking legal.

But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one devious
little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas, operating under
the alias "Enron," talked an over-the-edge free-market fanatic, Britain's
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the first completely
deregulated power plant in the hemisphere.

And so began an economic disease called "regulatory reform" that spread
faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher's Energy Minister, one
Lord Wakeham, with a bushel of dollar bills for 'consulting' services and a
seat on Enron's board of directors. The English experiment proved the
viability of Enron's new industrial formula: that the enthusiasm of
politicians for deregulation was in direct proportion to the payola provided
by power companies.

The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans wouldn't
swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten used to cheap
power available at the flick of switch. This was the legacy of Franklin
Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to be the last of the power
pirates, Samuel Insull. Wall Street wheeler-dealer Insull creator of the
Power Trust, and six decades before Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped
off consumers. To frustrate Insull and his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal
Power Commission and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act which told
electricity companies where to stand and salute. Detailed regulations
limited charges to real expenditures plus a government-set profit. The laws
banned "power markets" and required companies to keep the lights on under
threat of arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates.

Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told
utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed in
repair and the lights stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire and,
like me, crawled through the account books, to make sure the power execs
spent customers' money on parts and labor. If they didn't, we'd whack'm over
the head with our thick rule books. Did we get in the way of these
businessmen's entrepreneurial spirit? Damn right we did.

Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility companies --
no 'soft' money, no 'hard' money, no money PERIOD.

But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure from
the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one long
deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of electricity.
It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the gratitude of power
companies which ponied up $16 million for the Republican campaign of 2000,
seven times the sum they gave Democrats.

But Poppy Bush's gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the feds
only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer. For the
big payday they needed deregulation at the state level. There were only two
states, California and Texas, big enough and Republican enough to put the
electricity market con into operation.

California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a
1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nadar which would have blocked the de-reg
scam. Another $37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating the campaign
coffers of legislators to write a lie into law: in the deregulation act's
preamble, the Legislature promised that deregulation would reduce
electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when San Diegans in the first California
city to go "lawless" looked at their bills, the 20% savings became a 300%
jump in surcharges.

Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one life-time
contributor to the George W. Bush campaign, it was confident about the
future. With just a half dozen other companies it controlled at times 100%
of the available power capacity needed to keep the Golden State lit. Their
motto, "your money or your lights." Enron and its comrades played the system
like a broken ATM machine, yanking out the bills. For example, in the
shamelessly fixed "auctions" for electricity held by the state, Enron bid,
in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts of electricity over a 15 megawatt
line. That's like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble -- the lines
would burn up if they attempted it. Faced with blackout because of Enron's
destructive bid, the state was willing to pay anything to keep the lights
on.

And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the
California state Independent System Operator which directed power movements,
between May and November 2000, three power giants physically or
"economically" withheld power from the state and concocted enough false bids
to cost the California customers over $6.2 billion in excess charges.

It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden
Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find his
lost Democratic soul and impose price caps in California and ban Enron from
the market.

But the light-bulb buccaneers didn't have to wait long to put their hooks
back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving into the
White House, while he was still sweeping out the inaugural champagne
bottles, George Bush the Second reversed Clinton's executive order and put
the power pirates back in business in California. Enron, Reliant (aka
Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas Utilities) and the others who had
economically snipped California's wires knew they could count on Dubya, who
as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the richest deregulation deal in
America.

Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican
Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners ripped
the lid off electric bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara Mohawk of
the expensive obligation to properly fund the maintenance of the grid
system.

And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have
former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven:
They allowed a foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National Grid of
England, to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most of their
wages - producing a bonus for NiMo stockholders approaching $90 million.

Is tonight's black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field who've
watched Bush's buddies flick the switches across the globe. In Brazil,
Houston Industries seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro's electric company.
The Texans (aided by their French partners) fired workers, raised prices,
cut maintenance expenditures and, CLICK! the juice went out so often the
locals now call it, "Rio Dark."

So too the free-market cowboys of Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed
staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark Ages.

Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster: re-call
the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to the
electricity price fixers. And unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov. Gray Davis
stood alone against the bad guys without using a body double. Davis called
Reliant Corp of Houston a pack of "pirates" --and now he'll walk the plank
for daring to stand up to the Texas marauders.

So where's the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe
Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing the
foe that they used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for yet more
electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there's no sense
defeating Iraq if a hostile regime remains in California.

Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don't know if the
truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the dim
bulb in the White House.

ottawa report....

no matter what jimmy kimmell & conan obrian say (they must have taken from
same incorrect news source) there were NOT  22 examples of looting in ottawa.
there WERE 22 kids in the south end milling about, i heard. & a couple of
guys with guns tried to rob a store on sparks street, but government
workers stopped one of them.

lucky jason le heup in toronto, looting coach house books as he did, but
yes, it is pretty easy to loot there with the lights on. go for something
bigger, like, a car dealership. now that would be hard.

i declared my apartment a state of emergency weeks ago. there are crews
currently working around the clock.

on the other hand, my neighbour jwcurry (concrete/visual poet) wasnt
affected by the blackout at all. he just couldnt make coffee. brought the
guitars out, a few drinks, & cooked over the firepit in the backyard. ah,
technology.

"They grabbed my neck and hurled me out of the courtroom,
put me in this black SUV and then drove me to a federal
building..."

an Interview with Sherman Austin

By MERLIN CHOWKWANYUN

http://counterpunch.org/merlin08162003.html


On August 4th, U.S. District Court Judge Steven V. Wilson,
a Reagan appointee, sentenced 20-year-old Southern
California anarchist Sherman Austin to a year in federal
prison, three years of probation and a $2,000 fine. Austin
is the webmaster of the anarchist website
www.raisethefist.com. Nearly two years ago on January 24,
2002, federal law enforcement agents raided Austin's
Sherman Oaks, CA home and seized all his computers and
other possessions. In late 2002, after months of legal
limbo and harassment in between, federal prosecutors
formally accused Austin of distributing information on
explosives with the knowledge that some readers would use
such info to commit a federal violent crime. That became a
federal 'crime' in 1997, when Sen. Dianne Feinstein
attached a blatantly unconstitutional amendment to a
defense spending bill. The offending web material on his
raisethefist.com was part of an Internet tract called the
"Reclaim Guide" that Austin didn't even author -- but for
which he had offered free hosting on his site.

Although Austin initially planned to fight the charge and
go to trial, he later learned this could have entailed
risking up to 20 years in prison under penalty clauses in
the 1997 federal law. Additionally, there existed
terrorism sentencing enhancements first enacted in 1995
that saw their reach broaden under subsequent legislation,
including the notorious 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective
Death Penalty Act, a Patriot Act antecedent signed with
much fanfare by Bill Clinton. Austin thus accepted a plea
bargain under which he was sentence.

His case has major implications for civil liberties and
cyberlaw. It also is a case study in post-9/11 judicial
railroading, the dereliction of duty by the establishment
left (Mother Jones et. al) to cover it adequately, and the
escalating clamp-down on dissent towards which many
socially and politically disconnected Americans seem
(sometimes cheerfully) oblivious. And the case
demonstrates that Ashcroft Justice existed long before
spineless Democrats abdicated the executive office.

Much discussion about Austin has come from inaccurate
secondhand information. The interview below, derived from
a series of lengthy conversations the author had with
Austin, allows Austin to narrate, in his own words, all
the (sometimes farcical) twists leading up to his
sentencing.

THE RAID, LEGAL BACKGROUND

MERLIN CHOWKWANYUN: Let's start from Point A. What
happened? How did this all begin? You were living in
Sherman Oaks, CA on January 24, 2002.

SHERMAN AUSTIN: It was around 4 p.m. in the afternoon. I
was just taking a nap. Luckily, my sister was home. She
went out with her friend, and when she was leaving, when
she was walking to her car, she noticed a lot of
FBI-looking cars and agents with those earpieces, parked
all up and down the street. She knew something wasn't
right. She ran back into the house and told me what was
up, so I got up and went to the front door. Two special
agents at the front door pulled me outside. By that time,
they had already had the house surrounded with loaded
weapons, machine guns, shotguns...about 25 federal agents.

MC: What was your first reaction? Did you know what they
were coming for?

SA: Yeah, I wasn't really surprised. Right when my sister
told me, when I woke up, I pretty much knew why they were
there. They had been monitoring the site for a very long
time, and at times, I received over 100 hits from the
Department of Defense on the website, so I wasn't the
slightest bit surprised.

MC: What did the agents proceed to do?

SA: They showed me a search warrant, and I just glanced at
it. I was half-awake. I was just kind of taking it easy,
not really putting up a fuss.

They just went into the house. They searched all the rooms
in the house. They knew where my room was. They went back
there, looked at all the computers, asked me to come in
and tell them what all the computers were for specifically
so they knew how to dismantle the network I had been
running. They searched the garage, pretty much everywhere
with their guns still out and drawn. They still had people
surrounding the house with their weapons drawn.

MC: In addition to seizing the computer equipment, they
also seized political literature. Is that correct?

SA: Yeah, I had a big stack of political literature,
everything from just newspapers to basic literature,
books, bios. They just took that entire stack and put it
in a big box as well as a bunch of protest signs I had.

MC: The warrant refers to documents and materials with
keywords like, "International Monetary Fund," "IMF,"
"WEF," anything anyone involved with the
anti-globalization movement would read. After they seized
this, then what happened?

SA: They came into my room, took out all the computers,
and mirrored each hard drive. When they were done
downloading all the information off each hard drive, they
took all the computers, all the literature, and loaded
everything into a big white truck and left.

My room was ransacked. After that, I just took pictures of
my room, the way they left it, and wrote an article about
what happened and posted it around. I was still planning
to go to the World Economic Forum (WEF) protest in New
York [in early February 2002], even despite what happened.
I drove to New York in my car. When I got there, I didn't
get a chance to march really. I was just standing in
Columbus Circle, and then about 15-20 police officers just
rushed us. They completely broke through this line of
media people. They arrested about 26 of us. I was in jail
for about 30 hours. I think mostly everyone else was in
there for about 20 to 25 hours.

While I was in jail, they handcuffed me and took me to a
backroom, where a detective from the FBI and a Secret
Service agent were, and they interrogated me for about
three or four hours. During this whole time, I kept
noticing more and more FBI agents walking in and out of
the room. They asked me stupid questions like if I was a
terrorist or involved in any terrorist organizations. I
told them, "No," and it's funny, he [an agent] looked at
me like I was seriously a terrorist and that I was lying
to him.

You know how they use those interrogation tactics on you?
It's just unbelievable. There's no way to describe it.

MC: They knew you were coming to New York?

SA: What I had later learned was that the FBI knew I was
going to New York a couple days after the raid. The Secret
Service notified the Chief of Police to pick me up and
arrest me. I guess they just wanted to scoop a bunch of
people up, hoping they got me, and unfortunately they did.

MC: After your arrest and the 30 hours, what happened?

SA: I was released and waiting in the court for someone to
pick me up for about 30 minutes. About five, six FBI
agents walked into the courthouse and arrested me. They
said I was being arrested for distribution of information
related to explosives over the Internet. I asked, "Why
didn't you arrest me in California?" When I was raided in
California, they said, "You're in trouble, but you're free
to go right now. You're not going to be arrested. You can
leave right now."

They grabbed my neck and hurled me out of the courtroom,
put me in this black SUV and then drove me to a federal
building, where they processed me. They put me in a
maximum-security federal jail facility in downtown
Manhattan, where I was at for about 11 days until I was
taken to Oklahoma.

MC: How long were you in Oklahoma?

SA: I was in Oklahoma federal jail for about two days, so
it was a total of 13 days in custody. We were going to try
and see if I could get bail, but at the bail hearing, the
judge denied me bail because the FBI had said I was a "man
on the mission" and that I was coming to "carry out" plans
of action. When they searched my car, they said that they
found a gasoline canister and I think duct tape. Who
wouldn't have a gasoline canister on them when driving
3,000 miles across country?

MC: What exactly was on the website that they found so
alarming or that they claimed to find so alarming?

SA: There was a link posted on my site to another site,
which wasn't affiliated with raisethefist.com, but which
was hosted on the same server because I gave hosting space
to different people who wanted some free hosting. I just
provided the link to that site. It was called the Reclaim
Guide. It was just a general protest guide that went over
security culture and stuff like that. A small portion of
that guide dealt with explosives information. This
information was just pathetic compared to the type of
stuff you could find in any library or any other website.
There's so much detailed information out there on
explosives and how to use and build explosives that you
can find on the Internet. If someone wanted to use
explosives for illegal purposes, I don't think they would
rely on raisethefist.com to get their information because
there's so much information out there readily available.

There's something on the Internet called the White
Resistance Manual. It's pretty much for white
supremacists. It's a manual to carry out a large-scale
guerilla campaign through means of assassination, threats,
obtaining funds through fraud, everything from firearms to
explosives. I've seen, not surprisingly, no action taken
against those people, but here I am, an anarchist website,
not even close to what that is, not even close to what
else you can find on the Internet.

While they were at my house, interrogating me, they asked
me about seven times if I authored the Reclaim Guide. I
told them seven times I didn't author it. In the arrest
warrant that they had written after the raid when they
arrested me in New York, it says that I told them I
authored the Reclaim Guide. It's funny how they try to
slip it by and build a whole fraudulent case against you
with things that you didn't do.

MC: Now what was the exact charge? Its not just that
information about explosives was on the server, but there
was also this clause on intent...

SA: From what I've heard, it's not illegal to distribute
information on explosives. What's illegal is the intent
part. It's such a weird charge because it's almost like
thought crime. How do you prove that someone has intent? I
can go on to tons of other websites that have explosives
information on them, especially white supremacy web sites.
We obviously know they have intent because they've used
that type of information before against people. They're
not being prosecuted for it.

To me, it makes it better for them because that way they
can use that as a form of selective enforcement on whom
they want to bring charges against with that type of
charge and whom they just want to let by and let off the
hook.
It's almost like how they prove intent is if maybe you're
an anarchist or a socialist or a communist or just anyone
who doesn't agree with the way things are currently going
in this political climate right now. It's interesting
because...I'd said this before...how do they prove intent?
Bush made that pretty obvious when he said, "You're either
with us or against us." If you disagree, you have intent,
right then and there.

MC: I've read one affidavit in which the FBI still claims
that you wrote the Reclaim Guide, even though it's fairly
obvious that you didn't. If you go to archive.org, you can
actually see the old site, and it's very obvious that the
site's structure links, as you said, to a bunch of
different sites. From what I understand, the FBI knew that
you didn't author it, and they still persisted in claiming
that you did. Is that correct?

SA: Yeah. We went through a number of different plea
agreements because things were always getting changed, and
every time they presented us with a new and different plea
agreement, the prosecutors or the FBI always put back in
that I authored the explosives information. The FBI even
interviewed the person who authored the explosives
information on that site that I was hosting. They knew,
even before the raid, that I did not author that
information, but they still tried to say I did in the
search warrant and everything.

MC: So after the WEF protest, the arrest in New York and
the two days spent in Oklahoma in Feb. 2002, what
happened?

SA: After that, I was pretty much released because the
prosecutors decided they didn't want to file an
indictment. I'm assuming they wanted to go through all my
computers first. My lawyer had a court order put in to
send me back on a plane to Los Angeles by myself, so I was
flown back to Los Angeles. I didn't have anything. All my
clothes I took with me, my car, my wallet, my money,
everything I had with me was still in New York. All I had
with me was my belt. I received my wallet about two weeks
later from my lawyer in New York.

MC: How much time elapsed before you heard again from a
prosecutor or authority figure?

SA: It was about six months until we heard again from the
prosecutor, but in between that time, there was a lot of
harassment from authority figures and local police...being
followed by detectives, being followed by FBI agents at
protests. It was funny because the first protest I went to
after I got out was in Irvine. It was against Taco Bell
because of the way they exploit their farm workers, tomato
pickers in Florida. When I went there, they had an FBI
agent there, and they had another FBI agent there in the
crowd, and he was just standing two feet in front of me,
taking pictures of me. He must have taken at least 10 or
20 pictures of me. I had to be escorted out of the protest
by people with the National Lawyers Guild because they
were surveilling me the whole time. It was unbelievable.

Things like that have happened. I've been riding my bike
down the street at night, and a police officer will stop
me, and he'll know my name. Two other cops will come, and
they both will know my name and ask me about my website.
They'll start asking me about my website and ask questions
like, "Why do you hate cops so much?" They will try to
debate me and argue with me on anarchism and everything
like that. It's just ongoing harassment.

MC: Later in 2002, when you heard from a prosecutor again,
what happened?

SA: My lawyer told me that the prosecutor called him and
said that they didn't really find anything on my computers
to get me for -- but they didn't want to let me off the
hook. At first I wanted to fight the charges, but then I
decided to take a pre-indictment binding plea, which was
going to be one month in jail and five months in a
community corrections facility. We got that set up, and
then I went to court to enter the plea before the judge,
and the judge rejected it because he wanted me to serve
more time.

After that, we went back to the drawing board and worked
up another plea, which was just a sentencing range between
6 and 12 months. It wasn't as specific as the first plea,
where it said one month in jail, five months in community
corrections.
We went back with that, but by the time we went back to
court for that, my criminal history went back up another
point because of another conviction I had because I was
pulled over by the Long Beach police for a broken
headlight. At that time, I didn't know my license was
suspended because I had never received anything in the
mail, so when they pulled me over, they asked me if I knew
my license was suspended, and I said, "No." They took my
car, and I was convicted because when you're driving with
a suspended license, it's a criminal conviction. That went
on my record, and since it was two convictions, my
criminal history category went up. My sentencing range
changed from between 6 and 12 months to 8 and 14 months.

MC: And now, you initially weren't going to do a plea
bargain. You were actually going to go to trial on
principle.

SA: Yeah, at first I just wanted to go to trial because
all I was going to risk was three to four years in prison.
We learned that was different after we consulted a
probation officer on the case, and we learned that a
terrorism enhancement was applicable to what I was being
charged with. What that is that it's the judge's decision
where he can add on up to 20 years onto your sentence, so
if I had gone to trial, I'd have risked anywhere from 20
to 24 years in federal prison.

MC: The judge, Stephen V. Wilson, was unhappy with the
eventual plea agreement and expressed this during a
hearing on June 30, 2003. That's when you were initially
scheduled to receive your final sentence. What did he say
then?

SA: We went in there, and my lawyer was telling the judge
how I just got caught up and I didn't really think about
what was posted on the website. My lawyer asked if he
accepted the plea.

The judge turned pretty defiant. It seemed like he already
had different plans made up. He said that this should be
looked at with more of a deterrent outcome to future
"revolutionaries" wanting to act in a similar manner. He
just openly admitted that he wanted to make an example out
of me.

He said also to the prosecutors something like, "Out of
all the nonsense cases you bring me, you finally bring me
something serious but don't take it seriously."

The atmosphere of the courtroom was nothing but political
at that time. It was completely obvious that this was
nothing but a political case. He made it clear that he
wanted to give me a lot of jail time. He said that he
wanted to give me at least between 8 and 10 months in
jail, but before making his final decision, he asked the
prosecutors what the Justice Department thought about the
case. It's pretty irrelevant to the case because it's the
prosecutors who are representing the government, not
necessarily the Justice Department. That's what the
prosecution told the judge.

The judge told the prosecution to get head FBI Director
[Robert] Mueller's opinion on the case. The judge wanted
him to consult on the case and get his opinion and
recommendation on sentencing.

MC: The judge used the word "revolutionaries." He seemed
to hint that you might also be a violent person, a harm to
others. Can you talk about the psychological study you
underwent to try and refute that?

SA: My lawyer said it was a good idea that I go see a
psychologist and go under a psychological analysis to
prove that I was a non-violent person by nature. I went
into that, and the psychologist wrote up an entire report
on me, stating that I was a non-violent person and that
jail wouldn't be the right sentence for me to serve. I
think she recommended something different like community
service or something like that. I think that pissed off
the judge even more. He said that this had nothing to do
with psychology. He was pretty turned off by it. He acted
like it was completely irrelevant to the case.

THE SENTENCE

MC: So now on June 30, 2003, he delayed the sentencing to
July 28, 2003. What happened then?

SA: Well, we went back to court on July 28, and when we
got there, we learned that the clerk never entered it into
the judge's schedule, so it was actually never scheduled
that day. So then, after that, we got it rescheduled for
next Monday, a week later. We went back on next Monday,
which was on August 4th, for sentencing. We went back, and
the judge asked the prosecutor what the FBI thought and
what the Justice Department thought. And the FBI and
Justice Department were both on board with the plea. They
both agreed with it...the sentencing guidelines of four
months in jail and four months in community confinement.
And the judge just asked my lawyer a few questions. My
lawyer advised me that I should just tell the judge a lot
had changed since the incident...I was 18 then, and I'm 20
now...and it was just try and tell the judge that I was a
good person, just try and set a positive image. But all of
that was pretty much completely irrelevant to the judge.
It looked like he already had his mind set and his mind
made up. He just announced that he wanted to give me 12
months in prison.

MC: It seems like he had hoped that the FBI would also
propose a very harsh sentence, and then when it didn't do
that, he just basically ignored what it suggested. What
was the reaction of people in the courtroom?

SA: Everyone seemed pretty shocked. The FBI, I don't think
they were shocked. They pretty much came out with smiles
on their faces. I think the prosecutors were a little bit
shocked. Everyone else who was there was shocked. It was
pretty saddening. It was pretty horrible that this judge
was just going to give me 12 months in prison for no other
reason really than to set an example, for no other reason
than my political views.

MC: Did he give a clear reason why he chose to go with 12
months even though the FBI had suggested four months?

SA: His only reason was that he wanted to set an example
for, in his words, future "revolutionaries."

MC: In addition to the one-year sentence in federal
prison, there are also three years of probation. When I
read these probation provisions, I was quite shocked.
These are very strict and draconian provisions. Can you
tell us what they are?

SA: One of them is that I can't associate with any group
or persons who advocate violence or political or social or
economic change. Basically, I can't associate myself with
anarchists. It actually says that on the pre-sentencing
report, that I can't associate myself with anarchists or
anarchist associations.

If I have to use a computer for work, I have to consult
with the probation officer, but I can't use a computer for
any type of political organizing or any type of political
use. It's just obvious that they're just trying to keep me
away from a computer.

As long as I'm using it for work to make money for income,
for a job, it's fine, but even with that, I'm going to
have very intense restrictions. I'm going to have my
computer probably seized at least once a week or once
every two weeks. I'm going to have to have tracking
software installed on my computers. I'm going to have to
surrender DSL phone bills and everything like that so they
can monitor every little thing I'm doing.

MC: So there was this Reclaim Guide on there. You didn't
author it. You were merely loaning out some server space.
Right after you were sentenced, there was a lot of
erroneous media coverage. In particular, there was an AP
article that a lot of sources across the country seemed to
pick up.

SA: After my sentencing, the AP article was written to
make it sound like I was the one who actually authored the
explosives information, and not just that, but that my
entire website was also explosives information. They
didn't point out that raisethefist.com was just an open
publishing website, and just a small portion of that
website contained a link to another website that had
explosives information on it. They made it sound like I
authored the information and the entire website was about
explosives, and they also made it sound like I apologized
for making the entire website, like I was just some stupid
little kid who didn't know any better and was just
completely intimidated by what the FBI had done.

MC: When will you have to report for prison, and do you
know where you are going?

SA: The date when I'm going to have to surrender myself is
September 3, which will be next month. I'm not sure
exactly where I'm going to be at, but I have an idea. They
might send me to Lompoc. They might send me to Boron or
Nellis. They might send me to Terminal Island. It's all up
to the Bureau of Prisons.

RACIAL DIMENSIONS

MC: You are an African-American male. What did you learn
about the racial dimensions of this case and this legal
system?

SA: There are definitely racial implications in this case.
We're dealing with a system that has more people locked up
in the prison industrial-complex than any other country in
the world. The longest I've been to jail is 13 days, but
every time I've gone, it's obvious there are racial
implications. We're dealing with a very racist
institution. I felt if I had been white and had a lot of
money, I could have bought my way out of this. It's just
disgusting what the system is doing, not just to people
who are politically involved but people who just happen to
be black.

There've been times where I've been waiting in jail and
seen young black males come back in tears because they've
had to take a plea and gotten 14 years because they've
basically been convinced that they couldn't fight the
system. Number one, they're a person of color. They come
from a low-income background. They don't have the money to
afford a private attorney like a lot of other people do
who happen to be white.
We can look at the people at Enron, who are just barely
getting a slap on the wrist, if anything. It's such
blatant racism if you look at it.

MC: The most outrageous irony to this case is that while
you will be going to prison for one year for
raisethefist.com, Kenneth Lay, the ex-head of Enron, has
not been indicted on anything. In your case, in terms of
racial dimensions, the person who actually did author the
Reclaim Guide, he was white and from a fairly affluent
background.

SA: Yeah, and I think he realizes that too. It's just so
obvious. Why didn't they go after him? If you look at the
charge, they could have just as much indicted him as they
wanted to indict me, but they decided to go after me
instead of him.

REFLECTIONS

MC: What do you say to people who have fears and are
worried about getting involved politically?

SA: First of all, don't let them intimidate you. Don't let
them keep you into a state of fear where you become
pacified and too afraid to stand up and voice your opinion
because that's what they want to do. If they keep us
pacified in a state of fear, they have us under control.
We have a very serious problem if they're able to do that.
If we don't speak up, who's going to speak up? It's only
up to us to do what has to be done to stop this problem,
to stop this system and this government from doing what
they're doing. The best advice I can give to people is
don't be intimidated. Don't let them scare you into not
getting politically active. There're more of us than there
are of them. They can't come after every single one of us.
If we all stand up, and we all take the initiative to take
an active role in challenging the system, they won't be
able to do anything about it. They don't have the capacity
to lock us all up. They're definitely going to try and
lock a bunch of us away and silence a bunch of us, but
they don't have the capacity to silence us 100%.

MC: Will raisethefist.com continue to run?

SA: Yeah, I'm working on currently setting up a team to
keep the site going and to make sure, if something happens
with our current host, that we can get the site moved to
another backup server immediately so we can eliminate any
long-term downtime.

MC: I must say that, in my opinion, liberal, bourgeois
organizations like the ACLU and institutional publications
like The Nation and Mother Jones really dropped the ball
on this case. I think the only publications that really
deserve a pat on the back are the Village Voice, the LA
Weekly, the Washington Post of all papers, and a very
little-known newsletter called the Progressive Populist,
and of course, IndyMedia. What's your take?

SA: It's kind of weird and messed up. It's confusing. Why
wouldn't the ACLU want to take something on like this?
They were contacted almost immediately after I was
arrested in New York by the FBI. They said they didn't do
criminal cases and couldn't do anything. It's obviously a
case that deals with civil liberties and freedom of
speech. When the government will come after us, they'll
tack these charges on us as criminal cases. It looks like
there are going to be more and more criminal cases that
involve civil liberties than there are going to be civil
suits. I think the ACLU, if they want to really start
defending people on their civil liberties, should really
think about reorganizing the way they represent people in
court.

OTHER ALLEGATIONS IN FBI DOCUMENTS

MC: I have to ask you to address one issue -- and it's in
many ways not a relevant question because it wasn't even
part of that one final charge -- but I'm asking it because
many observers hostile to your political orientation may
pounce on it, and you should have a chance to respond. In
the warrant and in this FBI memorandum I'm reading now,
there are sections on alleged "defacements" of private web
sites and such.

SA: They never proved anything. They sure had a bunch of
stuff about it in the warrant, arrest affidavit, and
discovery materials. We were thinking, since they included
it so much, why didn't the prosecutors just charge me with
that -- instead of the distribution of information charge
since that was a charge the judge was going to reject
their suggested sentencing range for. But they didn't want
to do it, I'm assuming, because they didn't have enough to
prove it.

MC: Right. I mean, I've always found it peculiar that if
those other supposed accusations were correct, why they
didn't just go for that instead of this distribution
charge with intent, which is significantly harder to show.

SA: The same with the "firearm," Molotov cocktail charge.

MC: What about the actual crime some FBI documents were
claiming -- the defacements and admitting to it? Is the
FBI memorandum inaccurate when they say that you admitted
to the this stuff? Did they take something you said out of
context?

SA: I don't remember their asking me to admit it. I
remember their saying, "Did you hack into any web site?"
and "Did you hack into any government computer systems?" I
was about to tell them, "No," then they kept cutting me
off saying, "If you did or don't know, then don't tell
us."

I don't remember admitting anything to them except that I
ran raisethefist.com, and I was an anarchist, and again, I
must have told them seven times straight out that I didn't
author the reclaim guide when they were right there at my
house, but they put in that I told them I authored it.

MC: On some sites, there are citations to an interview you
did with some reporter, in which you supposedly admitted
to the defacing. Now, reporters screw up all the time or
misquote. Is that what happened there?

SA: It was probably a misquote, or I was answering a
different question of his. I remember that interview
actually. It was over AIM while I was on the east coast
before the WEF.
I had tons of FTP servers and passwords stored on my
computers for web sites, which were my clients'. They
voluntarily gave them to me because I uploaded and
installed my software on their servers. They also said I
did credit card fraud too. It was the same thing with
credit cards, which were also in my client database, from
clients who purchased my software and at times would pay
for things on a monthly basis

They said my whole client database, which had my clients'
credit cards and billing info in it, was a database of
stolen credit cards I was using for credit card fraud A
lot of people who also ordered my software were using
stolen credit cards. I'd find out every time I got a
charge back. These charges were always reported as
fraudulent charges as well, so in my client database I had
people's orders with their billing info and credit card
numbers for orders that were made by other people doing
credit card fraud.

I was also running Linux 6.0, which had various exploits
in it. One I remember specifically was an exploit in the
DNS, which gave anyone complete access to my server.
Several times people used my server to try and break into
the FDIC and other government computer systems.

MC: I never asked you about the way the FBI interrogation
took place. Would you describe it as coercive? Were they
constantly interrupting you, bullying you into answers,
trying to pigeonhole you into saying certain things?

SA: They were playing the good cop, bad cop game. [FBI
Agent] John Pi tried to play nice like he was my friend.
They would ask questions, and if I didn't answer, go back
to them later and ask them again. The Secret Service, too,
held up a picture of Bush with crosshairs over him that he
found on my site and asked if I wanted to kill the
president. I said, "No," then he asked, "Well would you
like to see the president killed?"

MC: Do you wish you went to trial also so you could refute
those defacement claims? I know that wasn't in the
eventual charge, but I'm sure they would have tried to
introduce it somehow, perhaps to tar your character.

SA: If I knew I was going to get a year under the plea,
yeah, I would have taken it to trial.


LAW ENFORCEMENT SURVEILLANCE AND ONGOING HARASSMENT

MC: Can you talk about the Long Beach Police Department,
what sort of things they've been doing, and how long it's
been going on?

SA: I moved to Long Beach in 2002 around March, when I had
first got out of federal jail in New York and when I got
raisethefist.com back up and everything. I thought the
LAPD was bad. When I got to Long Beach, I'd never seen a
police force more crazy than the LAPD.

When I moved, I experienced everything from getting
followed to having undercover detectives parked in front
of where I was living, just watching people come in and
out. I saw a lot of weird stuff happen where undercover
police have looked into my car, walked around it, and then
walked off after I saw them and pretended that they were
ordinary people listening to walkmen. They'd have little
headphones, earpieces in their ears, but of course they
weren't hooked up to any walkmen. They were hooked up to a
walkie-talkie or something.

I've seen so much, not just happen to me, but other people
around me. I can go back to May 1, 2001. That was actually
my first time coming to Long Beach. We tried to have a
peaceful march on the streets as a celebration of workers'
rights day. It was May Day, and just two minutes into the
march, police were already swinging their batons at us.

Eventually, they just lured us into this trap and opened
fire on us with all this riot gear and all these rubber
bullets. That was an outrageous brutal attack. That was a
bloody brutal attack. They broke people's arms. I myself
was shot twice. I had embedded penetrating wounds in my
calf, which I still have scars of today, and I still have
one of the fragments embedded in my leg today, two and a
half years later.

Even after that, the repression from Long Beach Police
Department continued to intensify. They didn't just come
after me, but other people like Matthew Lamont [a Long
Beach-area anarchist], who's in jail right now. He just
pleaded no contest and got two years, and he has an appeal
in October.

We used to have an infoshop in Long Beach. It was an
anarchist community empowerment center. On Hitler's
birthday, Matthew Lamont was followed from the infoshop by
two Long Beach detectives into Whittier, and he was pulled
over, and they arrested him on explosives charges. They
were saying that he was going to blow up a Nazi party that
was supposed to happen that day. There was no Nazi party
scheduled for that day. He was arrested and taken to
Orange County jail facility and put in solitary
confinement.

He had court hearings at least a few times a month, and we
would always go to his court hearings. Every time I'd go
to his court hearings, I'd just come within a few blocks
of the courthouse, and all of a sudden I would have at
least five cop cars following me until I parked and got
out of my car, and then they would get out of the car and
ask why I was there...just basically harass me and
intimidate me. I'd walk into the courthouse, and sheriffs
inside of the courthouse would come up to me and ask if
there was anything planned for that day. They would treat
me like I was some leader or something. I'm just some
ordinary guy with a website just coming to view a public
court hearing, which is supposed to be a constitutional
right, but the way they intimidate you, the way they
harass you, it seems like they don't even want you to
come.

There's Javier Perez, who was deported after May Day. He's
actually in Mexico right now and doesn't have enough money
to make it back to the U.S. There's Robert Middaugh, who
was actually supposed to get out of jail after serving two
years, and then they arrested him again and put him back
in. I think he's out on bail now, but they're trying to
get him back in for even more time, even more years.

MC: What kind of things are they trying to charge them
for?

SA: Javier Perez, he was in jail, and they got him to sign
a voluntary deportation form in which they would let him
out if they deported him to Mexico. I think when he first
came to the United States, he was two-years-old. He
doesn't even speak Spanish. He didn't even grow up in
Mexico. What was he supposed to do there? It's been really
hard for him to make it through all this.

Robert Middaugh, I can't remember the exact charge, but I
know that what they're trying to charge him with now is
assault on a federal police officer from an incident that
happened in Wilshire, in downtown at the federal building,
when an anti-immigrant group was there having a
demonstration on the fourth of July a few years ago. I
think he was arrested, and one of the police officers said
that he threw a soda at him with his right hand but in
fact he's left-handed.

They're trying to give him some more time for that. It's
just absolutely ridiculous what they're doing, which is
just coming down on anyone and everyone they can.

They're not just coming down after those people, but the
Long Beach police have routinely just stopped people on
the street just because they're wearing black or they look
like an anarchist. They've stopped and harassed them,
followed them to the apartment, searched them. In one
case, one guy came into our center who was crying because
he said the police threw him to the ground and put guns to
his head and asked him if he was affiliated with the
infoshop we were running, and he said, "No." He had no
idea who we were until that happened. It was interesting
because a lot of people started coming in and telling us
that police had been following them and harassing them and
trying to search them because they were suspected of being
anarchists. A wave of people were coming in and telling us
what was going on.

MC: Has any effort been made to file complaints or
lawsuits against these cops?

SA: Yeah, there've been a lot of complaints filed. From
what I know right now, there's a lawyer who's setting up
individual lawsuits from what happened on May 1, 2001. I'm
not sure how soon that's all going to go through, but I
know that they tried to do a big civil case, and I think
it was denied. Since that happened, she's trying to get
individual lawsuits going.

MC: When you walk around Long Beach, they seem to
recognize you.

SA: They've told me my picture is hanging up in the Long
Beach police station. Ever since I've moved to Long Beach,
I've been pulled over so many times and harassed by
police.

MC: What techniques did the FBI use to watch you?

SA: They were packeting my Internet line, which is
basically monitoring all incoming and outgoing
information...all data going in and out of my DSL
connection. And through that, they were able to get
passwords and things like my e-mail accounts, my instant
messenger accounts. On numerous occasions, they blocked me
out of my e-mail accounts, changed the passwords, used the
e-mail accounts to change the domain name server [DNS
settings] on my domain and make it non-accessible on the
Internet...and then playing around with me, sending me an
instant message, using my own screenname online, and
telling me the password of the e-mail account and warning
me not to change it, saying that they were watching me.

They've gone into my instant messenger accounts,
completely taken control over them. They would start
instant messaging people, "You're next," and stuff like
that. I remember one time they came into my account, and I
caught them one time, and they threatened me like, "Your
ass is going to jail." They said a bunch of stuff. It was
pretty obvious they were packeting my line and looking
through, basically downloading all the information they
were getting that was coming in and out of my DSL
connection. When they would talk to people on my
screenname, they'd use the exact same wording that I'd
use. They tried to impersonate me word for word, use the
exact same wording I was using. It was pretty obvious they
were monitoring my conversations pretty extensively on a
daily basis, and they were watching everything pretty
closely.

MC: I understand you were also able to look at logs of IP
addresses [personally identifiable numbers assigned to
computers on the Internet] and things like that and that
was a second way of confirming they were packeting your
line. Is that correct?

SA: Exactly. When they were getting onto my screennames, I
was able to get their IP addresses, and I remember
tracerouting the IP address to a location in Los Angeles
down to a zip code, and within that same zip code was a
federal building. This happened on a lot of occasions.
Once I started getting their IPs, I noticed they kept
changing their IP addresses. I was able to find out they
were the same people going into my e-mail address and
using that to knock my domain offline. I remember when I
was blocked out of my e-mail address, I was assuming
someone was in there checking all the e-mails I was
getting. I sent an e-mail to the e-mail address with a
little script that logged the IP of anyone who opened up
any message, and it was the same IP address of the people
that I was logging who were on my screenname, so that
meant it was the same IP address of the person who logged
into my e-mail account and then used my e-mail to knock my
domain offline by changing the DNS servers.

MC: When you were speaking with these people, did you ever
raise this issue with them?

SA: Yeah, I always raised that issue. Sometimes, they
would just play stupid and not say anything. Other times,
they would just openly admit it. They would tell me the
name of my ISP. They would know my name. They would know
names of my friends. They would know where I was living,
what my phone number was. They would know what I was
looking at online, what I was doing, and things like that.

They were saying a lot of racist and sexist things as
well, not just to me but to other people, and a lot of
threats too like, "You're going to jail." Even death
threats sometimes. It was pretty disgusting what they were
doing. The funny thing is...do they not know we know who
they're working for and what they're doing? It seems like
everything they were doing was an intimidation tactic to
say, "We're watching you. You'd better watch out.

MC: What was their rationale for shutting down the
anarchist infoshop?

SA: We had a benefit show for raisethefist last year in
December. About six police officers came with a noise
complaint. We decided to end the show early because we
didn't want to risk any more trouble or anything like
that. About three days later, our leasing company,
Crestwave, contacted us and said that the police called
them and said that when they went to show, the door was
slammed in their face and someone tried to assault them.
The police told them that if they didn't evict us, they
were going to take legal action against them. They put
pressure on our leasing company to evict us. On May 3,
they evicted us. We had to shut down the place.

MC: People are stunned at how calm you manage to be
through this. The FBI, the prosecutors, were treating you
at some points like the most dangerous man in America. I
know some of your friends and your mother in the courtroom
were shocked. How are you so calm, and what's going
through your mind right now?

SA: I guess I'm so calm because I've probably gotten used
in the past few years to all the harassment and all the
things that have been going on, constantly in this legal
limbo, having to go back and forth to court, having the
thought that I'm potentially going to be facing a long
time in prison just there in my mind for a while now. I've
gotten so used to it that I pretty much expected them to
come down on me the way they did. I wasn't really
surprised when the judge gave me a 12-month prison
sentence in federal prison.

If you really look at it, that's the nature of this
government. This government has been persecuting people
for their political beliefs ever since the day it was
founded. Its been persecuting people for the color of
their skin ever since the day it was founded. Look what
happened in the 1960s and early 1970s. They completely
annihilated political organizations. They assassinated
political organizers, framed them up, locked them up in
jail. Some people just disappeared. They infiltrated
organizations. It's not surprising to see what they're
doing. That's the nature of this government. It's going to
be the nature of this system unless we continue to fight
back and do whatever we have to do that's necessary to put
an end to it.

The most important thing is just to stay focused and have
determination. I don't want them to scare me into thinking
that I can't continue doing what I'm doing. The more
they're going to come down on me, the more I'm going to
organize and continue do things within the community and
raisethefist.

Reuters cameraman killed near Baghdad

Sunday, August 17, 2003

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----



(08-17) 12:36 PDT LONDON (AP) --

A Reuters cameraman was shot and killed Sunday while working near a U.S.-run
prison on the outskirts of Baghdad, the London-based news agency said.

Witnesses reported that Mazen Dana, 41, was filming outside Abu Ghraib
prison in western Baghdad when he was shot, Reuters said.

A Reuters staffer told The Associated Press in Baghdad that Dana, a
Palestinian, appeared to have been shot by U.S. soldiers as he was
videotaping outside the Abu Ghraib prison after a mortar attack there
Sunday, in which six prisoners were killed and about 60 others were wounded.

The staffer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the videotape in
Dana's camera showed two U.S. tanks coming toward him, two shots, apparently
from the tanks, rang out and Dana fell to the ground. He was taken away by a
U.S. helicopter for treatment.

"Mazen was one of Reuters' finest cameramen and we are devastated by his
loss. He was a brave and an award winning journalist who had worked in many
of the world's hotspots," Stephen Jukes, Reuters' global head of news, said
in a statement.

"He was committed to covering the story wherever it was and he was an
inspiration to friends and colleagues at Reuters and throughout the
industry."

A U.S. military statement issued in Baghdad confirmed "a fatal accident
involving a civilian at Abu Ghraib prison" and said an investigation was
underway.

Dana's death brings to 17 the number of journalists killed in Iraq since the
war started March 20.

An outspoken critic of the Israeli government's treatment of journalists,
Dana was honored by the Committee to Protect Journalists with an
International Press Freedom Award in November 2001 for his work covering
conflict in his hometown of Hebron in the West Bank. He was shot at least
three times in 2000, according to the citation on the group's Web site.

"Words and images are a public trust and for this reason I will continue
with my work regardless of the hardships, even if it costs me my life," Dana
said after accepting the award.

We have fixed glitches and are ready to release finally (we hope) a new =
collaborative website: Penumbrae, being a collection of "dirty" (mostly =
mildly risque rather than filthy) poems with clean photos and sound =
recordings of the readings.  The collection purports to be by a mother =
and daughter who bear little resemblance to ourselves; hopefully the =
fiction is part of the fun.  Plus there is one more goodie in the piece =
--- look for it!

The buttons that load the sounds take a little while to appear on a =
modem, but the wait is reasonable and if you go to the text and come =
back the button will probably be loaded.

We are really eager to get feedback and perhaps find a home for this =
work.  Two of the poems have been published previously, one online and =
one in a print publication, but there is added material in the web =
installation.

it will be a name
the consequences are very uncomfortable
everything is difficult to live in
unwanted nightmare of presentation
not to look at the name

mildly risque rather than filthy) poems with clean photos and sound

I used to have Kenward Elmslie out to Seattle once in a while to sing in his
crazy-lady costumes. He had a very pretty song that went,

"Whatever happened to the poem as poem, Sneaky Pete?"

There was a loop-de-loop biplane in the poem for some reason I can't
remember.  Some of my nicest memories of poetry are him singing his songs. I
didn't think he was very political, but one of his plays was cancelled in
Seattle because he used a word that you can't use any longer -- perhaps it had
to do with small black children.  The play was called Postcards.  The whole
cast went on strike when he refused to strike the word out of the play.  It
was never produced at least not in Seattle where it was undergoing a full
stage production until one of the young women in the play objected to this
word.  Darn it, I can't remember it.

She was watching a pale blue fluid move slowly through a tube from a beaker
to a retort

a fawn jumped out from the bushes and he chased her. She was running along
the river. He caught up and just jumped on top of her

Kafka was lost, too, in the hallways of the Imperial Palace,
riding elevators that didn't serve his floor, shuffling one step
ahead of sleep-walking co-eds, pockets stuffed with change

She and I sloped each other's soar,
nicked and wheezy as laughs, a mouth of nets,
yet never once meant laugh. A whole lie
had prevented itself, somewhere, for us

Our fierce hum has forsaken us.
I saw when I dove past it
how light our loves had been
to have not lifted a truce. When frost smothered her
I leaked for moons

electricity is very democratic
running close to the edge
the flow of information
mobility, perfect timing
the enemy
the only place Detroit could buy gas

I dreamed of intruders, inside and out. My muffled
shots woke my son. Something in the wind points to
fall, more than a month away, though smudged
by woodsmoke, forest fires scorching Montana. The air's
filling with seeds. His birthday letters tell a story
of one man's intense life as it collided - as it's still
colliding - with another's. There will be no survivors

PRESS RELEASE

The Failure of Conservatism in Modern British Poetry
Andrew Duncan
228 x 152mm 356pp
1844710327 Hardback   GBP 40.00   USD 56.95   AUD 110.95

What is the cost of failure for modern British poetry?

In an explosive critical work by Andrew Duncan, surely intended to set the
poetry world alight, we take a journey through every decade since 1950,
taking stock of what feels like the entire national poetic output.

In the ensuing melting pot of philosophies, transnational exchange,
performance and experimentation, as well as the hilarious debunking of some
recent trends in writing practice, we will see a new poetry emerging before
our eyes; a poetry of ideas, international ambition, technical exploration
and a conviction that serious poetry matters to the nation. Against this
credo we will find an enormous range of poets from every decade revisited,
lit up and celebrated for their contribution to a developmental vision of
poetics. Most importantly, a wide range of disinherited British writers are
drawn back from the silence of recent fashion and poetry politics and
delivered to us as modern masters the country should be proud of.

This intensively researched and polemical work exposes the silence and
ignorance that has greeted British innovation in poetry since the 1950s,
culminating in the almost total absence of British poets on the world stage.
Duncan leads us into the vacuum to find a lost heritage of exciting and
necessary work by poets across the spectrum of British society. Above all
Duncan allows us to remember that poetry is a vital art that can be saved by
a focus on the historical sinews of modernism and post modernism, a total
engagement with the historical impetus to British innovation that reaches
back to the Romantics.

This is a must have book for anyone interested in the future of British
poetic enterprise, from writing practice to publishing, teaching to
research, and most importantly for contemporary reading. This is a book for
the 21st century poet and reader, a book to which all other critical surveys
must now pay homage and against which the current canon must now be tested.
It marks an assault on a closed poetry infrastructure and reminds all young
writers that the world is a large and complex place, a place demanding
serious intellectual consideration and at every instance committed writing.

"I think it is brilliant, exciting, often witty, and very important."

several years ago i was visiting friends in London, had the day to myself, and went to
Foyle's, said to be the largest bookstore in the world.  turns out what they really mean is
that they have the largest number of books, while a Barnes & Noble in New York City
has the largest bookstore by square feet.  the books in the Barnes & Noble are pretty
standard, and they really shouldn't brag when a place like Foyle's exists.  hell, Gotham
Bookmart is still far more interesting than that Goliath B&N.

but in Foyle's
i decided that i was going to look at every single book in the poetry section, one of
the largest poetry sections i've ever seen in a store.  to be honest, for whatever reason,
most of the poetry in ANY bookstore in London was a disappointment.  i mean, HOW
can a country have poets like Tom Raworth and Simon Cutts, and have such a dismal
selection on the shelves?

but i came across the book MASKER by Paul Brown, and it was quite a find!  "hmm, this
has been here awhile," the clerk said, ringing me up.  it was only $4.95, but had been on
the shelf since 1982.  amazingly, there were only 250 copies printed, and i found the last
retail copy.  there're so many poets in the world who write things we would love to read,
and the Internet has come to save our lives with that, but there are still all these thousands
of poets who wrote long before the net, poets like Paul Brown, who could change our
sight and hearing, if only we could HAVE the opportunity.

think of all the poets before paper and pens were mass-produced.  now i'm beginning to
sound like a child who is terrified of his therapist dying.

but if any of you out there are familiar with Paul Brown (guess he was in London in the
early 80s) i'd appreciate contact with him.  my hope is that he continued writing his
poems and is somewhere writing them right now.  that is to say, that i hope he isn't one
of those poets (i keep meeting them lately) who decide that it's time to "grow up" and
put aside the pen and paper:  living death.

anyway, here's a piece from Paul Brown's MASKER.  he's one of the few poets who uses similes i don't mind.  is it just me who thinks so, or are similes for the lazier poets?

Haroldo, co-founder of the brazilian Concrete Poetry, together with his=20=

Guillermo Cabrera Infante and others, Haroldo made a reputation that=20

the century's brazilian poetry.
It was a terrible loss, one of the kind will be difficult to replace.=20
For me and some friends it was the loss of someone who has kept a=20

politically, avant-gardist artistically, Haroldo always remarked the=20
Maiakovski's statement that says: "There is no revolutionary art=20
without revolutionary form". On the other hand he pioneered the idea=20
that the brazilian poetry had his own right to pertain the position of=20=

underdeveloped art. If I am here now, writing to you, I must owe this=20
to people like Haroldo that opened the ways to our experimental=20

May the gods take care of his incredible soul.

Unless torture is some dark ecstatic state in which poetry may occasionally
emerge with blinding force, yesterday's lead article by Joshua Phillips in
the Washington Post Magazine ( is not an occasion of poetry, but one full of
hard knuckle specific images of the utilization of terror as an instrument
of American foreign policy, and, by extension from El Salvador, one can
fully suspect that is practiced in various forms with anyone these days who
qualifies as "suspicious", particularly if one is of Muslim or Arab
appearance and "in the wrong place."

David Antin  produced a ripple of chuckles last Friday evening at the San
Francisco Art Institute when he spoke about his experience that afternoon of
looking at the Chagall show at SFMOMA.
"Chagall," he said, "is the Norman Rockwell of the shtetl, a very cleaned up
shtetl."

David clearly hasn't lost his trigger - and the talk was also interesting
for the way he talked about Guston's process - the "annulment" of lines in
the building of the fifties' works of abstraction - something that was
evident in the way he builds his talks, annulling and cross-hatching the
narrative strokes to build a story that's not a story.

Which makes it hard for Antin to acknowledge the re-emergence and what I
experience as the killer power of Guston's later figurative work. Tremors!

Thanks to the indefatigable Bill Berkson for organizing the event.

phenomenology of the numb(n).exe, of some others

http://www.asondheim.org/portal/ *.exe

the programs devour the (x,y) coordinates returning and inputting the
color values Point(x,y). the image reconstitutes itself.

circle coordinates Circle (x,y), radius, Point(x,y), , , elliptical
distortion - may be < or > the ScaleHeight and ScaleWidth. beyond the
image, an infinite exterior of black (0,0,0) or white (255,255,255).

in this manner the _exterior_ interrupts the _interior,_ constructing the
_binary_.

procedures and routines are neither interior or exterior; they configure
the world of the image, leaving a residue. they take residence elsewhere.

the resulting _flux_ of the image is the result of devouring. think of the
image as fractionated - internals and externals.

devouring occurs in digital waves across the limits. the tangential
escapes; the sign-sine operates from normalization, scanning Width and
Height.

what is exterior is never recorded; it is left to the _imagination_.

what is interior is fully recorded; it is interpreted by the _fancy_.

the semantics are always in dialog, as semantics always are. the image:
what of it? easily readable. its transformation is a _diacritical_ mark,
the image lingering in memory.

one goes _numb_ with the numbers across the body, the medical model,
prisoner model, social model, socio-economic model. the _skein_ of the
stationary body.

or the fractionation of the x-nor or not-x-nor logical inversions of the
pen-writing _degree ground zero_ of contradiction, unspeaking, mute. and
the superposition or projection of the mute.

'nowadays, the earth is not only fragile, it is becoming increasingly

Hi all,

I have two tickets, mezzanine behind home plate, under the overhang (so the

You can email me here or call me at 212-842-2664.

thanks,
david

I am taking the liberty to pass on this disturbing message and want to believe in petition intervention, if not in divine intervention. . .
Brigitte Byrd

Hearing on AMINA LAWAL SET TO BE STONED ON - 27  AUGUST 2003

  The Nigerian Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence for Amina Lawal, condemned for the crime of adultery on August 19th 2002, to be buried up to her neck and stoned to death. Her death was postponed so that she could continue to nurse her baby.

    Hearing on her Execution is now set for 27 AUGUST 2003. If you haven't following this case, you might like to know that Amina's baby is regarded as the 'evidence' of her adultery.

   Amina's case is being handled by the Spanish branch of Amnesty International, which is attempting to put together enough signatures to make the Nigerian government rescind the death sentence.

  A similar campaign saved another Nigerian woman, Safiya, condemned in similar circumstances. By March 4th the petition had amassed over 2,600,000 signatures. It will only take you a few seconds to sign Amnesty's online petition.

   Please sign the petition now, then copy this message into a new email and send it to everyone in your address book.

    Go to the web page http://www.amnesty.org.au/e-card/petition.asp

UPDATE ON AMINA LAWAL

Amina Lawal, a 30 year-old Nigerian woman, sentenced by a Shari'ah court to death by stoning, has once again had her appeal adjourned. Amina's appeal will now be heard on 27 August 2003. According to the registrar of the Shari'ah Court of Appeal of Katsina State, the hearing could not take place because there was an inadequate number of tribunal members to hear the appeal. Two of the judges were reportedly serving on ad-hoc elections tribunals, constituted after general elections in April and May 2003.

Amina confessed to having had a child while divorced. Pregnancy outside of marriage constitutes sufficient evidence for a woman to be convicted of adultery according to the new Shari'ah-based penal code for Muslims, introduced in Katsina state.

The man named as the father of her baby girl reportedly denied having sex with her and his confession was enough for the charges against him to be discontinued. Amina did not have a lawyer during her first trial when the judgement was passed. But she has now filed an appeal against her sentence with the help of a lawyer hired by a pool of Nigerian human rights and women's rights organisations. Amina is awaiting her appeal at home.

Homeland Security Measures


The president of the Dewy Mattress Company issued an advisory to all =
employees.

"Please report customers who have removed their mattress tags."  This =
was to be done via a new, miniaturized, electronic camera affixed on =
said tags.

"I can't do that.  It violates my customers' civil rights," said one =
sales manager at the main office.

"You're canned.  Unless you obey.  And if you tell, we'll tell your wife =
what's been happening on your mattress each noontime for three years."

He hastened to obey.

Willie Loomis almost tells her about Seven Pines Drive
in Lorain, Ohio. She was Maggie Evans! If anyone could
possibly understand, it was her! He lay shockingly
awake all night, kissing the edges of the water he
always made. She was Josette! She was Maggie Evans!
This was not a white pipe he found; it was not a pipe.


Seven Pines Drive, he would have said: walk down there
a while.

During the big tornado, one edge of the city kissed
another edge of the city. I was pacing Narragansett at
night, restless, searching for you in every lighted
car that singed past me. Because the houses in Lorain,
Ohio, are so squat, so sprayed across an earth
thoroughly immersed in August, there was always enough
sky to see. I grew used to being alone.

I could have used a balance (you) to measure my
trajectory, my velocity there. One edge, in our life,
kissed another edge; you and I, honey we folded
shadows and chiseled swatches. Some thought us coiled
grammars, then. Everything happens was what did. I
suppose now friction itself is an imaginary fire, as
beautiful and unexpected as life-boats sprouting from
ululations of the lake.

Flowers were just a gesture to you. What you couldn't
take was my presence, so far across those waves, only
perceptible via the threading of my cries with those
of the night's wind. You must have grown strange in
those shadows never reached by touch, paler than
anonymity. If you were here now, slipping down
Whispering Pines Drive, I would try to solve the
riddle with you. I would dirty myself with try.

Obviously it's not as bad as being stoned to death as the poor Nigerian wom=
an may
yet be, but injustice at any level really does rankle.  The thing is that I=
 am still
not sure of where the line should be drawn in regards to ethics/aesthetics.=
  Does
anybody have any good ideas on this?  Saint Paul in the letter to the Colos=
sians
argues that our language should always be gracious, and in one of the psalm=
s it says
that a sweet tongue is the tree of life.  I am too iconoclastic for that, b=
ut on the
other hand -- um, um, um.

To round out my day of baseball game ticket posts:

I'm going to the Yankee game this Sat. Aug. 23 vs. Baltimore. It's Ron Guidry
day, saluting the Yankee pitcher who is still my favorite ballplayer (I even
invited him to my Bar Mitzvah). Pregame ceremonies begin at 2:30 p.m.

My dad was supposed to join me, but he can't make it, as my folks have their
50th anniversary party the next day. So, for the mere price of $24 (what I paid
for it) you get to join Ron Guidry's greatest fan, me, on Ron Guidry day, and
attend a baseball game with the only editor/publisher who has named their small
press after a baseball player. Hell, I may even bring my 26-year-old Ron Guidry
scrapbook with me, too.

You can email me here or call (212) 842-2664.

best,
david

Yes, I've got it twice in the last couple of days. I simply trashed it.
It pretends to be addressed to me personally but doesn't know any more
than the signature my server recognises - i.e. it's obviously a
mass-mailoing = spam or a form thereof; it does not know my name. My
computer tells me  it's (hmmm. I think it does anyway - I can't
remember) a movie clip, or a tiff,  or something like that. I never open
those anyway without advance notice from the sender.

So trash it. It's some idiot who really wants to be nuisance; e-mails
are always disposable, including this one from me.

My basic principle: if I don't know the sender, trash it.

I do not think ANYone has the automatic "liberty" to intrude into my
life, invade my mailbox - either snailbox or "virtual" - for let's call
them ulterior purposes, any more than they have the "liberty" to hector
and bully me in the street.  There's a heck of a lot of woolly and
dangerous daftness surrounding that dangerous word liberty - I will say
nothing about the meaning of "freedom" south of the 49th....

Is anyone else getting proliferated by emails with something about
"details"
that includes an attachment with the request to open, etc.
I don't want to open no unexplained nothing!
So help me out if I am being an anti-viral curmudgeon.

Proverbs actually -->

Proverbs 15:4 - "A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness
therein is a breach in the spirit."

...but even better I think:

Proverbs 15:15 - "All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is
of a merry heart hath a continual feast."


And my favorite proposition of Spinoza's (Prop. XXXI):

"In so far as anything agrees with our nature, thus far it is
necessarily good."


Also Mr. Marley - "Speak happiness! (Sad enough without your woes.)"

Subject:      clarification on Amina Lawal's case
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

This is from the Amnesty International site:

Clarification
'Nigeria: Amina Lawal's appeal case to be heard on 27 August

After several adjournments, the hearing of Amina Lawal's appeal is due to
take place on 27 August 2003 in her home state of Katsina, northern Nigeria.
Amina Lawal and her lawyers are expected to be present at the hearing. The
judicial process should follow its course if the quorum of judges is met
this time.

Amnesty International continues to receive queries falsely claiming that
Amina Lawal’s execution is imminent - before or on 27 August - and referring
to Amnesty International as a source.

No execution of the sentence is due before or on that date.

Amnesty International understands that Amina Lawal’s right to legal
representation and her right to appeal are guaranteed at this stage. She is
not in detention and has good legal representation. She is also being
supported by a coalition of Nigerian women's groups and human rights groups.
Amnesty International is in close touch with these organizations.

"Unfortunately, this case has now been adjourned so many times that many of
those who have campaigned for her sentence to be quashed cannot understand
why a woman and her child can be put under so much duress. This is becoming
a clear case of justice delayed is justice denied," Amnesty International
said.

A.)  Read, buy, ingest any poem that K. Silem Mohammad writes.
                Bring him to your town,
your home, your bed & breakfast  --
        give him money you
don't have and money your friends don't have
                so he can come to your town and read you his poems
and you can think
        "thank god I took
                        that strange man's

These poems kick ass all day, all night, in all seasons, through weather

        through
                        bad fashion, steel grates, and chopped livers
he kicks ass twice in the morning and keeps kicking till the sun goes down
        when he switches legs

his poems will kick your ass


and you will like it.

"Griffith University is currently being affected by two more computer

The second virus is called the welchia worm.  It is very similar to the
Blaster virus that hit the world last week.  This virus only targets
Windows 2000 and Windows XP computers.  All other Operating systems are
safe from this virus.  We currently have machines being scanned and
cleaned
on bootup for this virus.  Users who do not log into Novell Servers and

You have to remember that Becket was a dramaturge. His sets were phenomenal=
 pieces of art. Grove published the stage directions to Godot and their hig=
hly detailed as to lighting, color, shading, etc.

He didn't say it in as many words.=20

About 7 years ago, Lincoln Center had a Becket Festival. The Gate Theatre f=
rom Dublin came and put on all his plays. It was incredible. There is a gro=
up that calls itself the Becketeers: James Knowlson (biographer), Ed Albee,=
 Mel Gusow, Robert Scanlon (ART), Tom Bishop (head of NYU French Dept) and =
a few others. They put on a big symposium the night of my 30th birthday. An=
 ex of mine worked for Bishop at the time.

They spewed on and on about Becket, etc. There was a man whose name I canno=
t remember who was Beckets assistant director for the last few years of Bec=
ket's life. Gusow said something like Chekhov was the first half of 20th C =
drama and Becket was the second half of 20th C drama. Albee said that Becke=
t pushed the form to its limits and there at its limits he found his subjec=
t matter. So, I asked the last question of the night. I had had my hand up =
for more than an hour in a room filled with 300 or so people and with a cap=
acity of only 175. Anyway, my question: "At the end of the 20th Century wha=
t can we take from Becket into the 21st Century?" Ablee and Gusow just laug=
hed at me. So, I stood up in front of the crowd and pressed. I reiterated t=
heir foolish comments and finally pointedly asked, "So, if we were to push =
Becket to his limit what would we find?" Gusow had no answer other than to =
say to me that we will continue to read Becket in the 21st C. Scanlon said =
something about the sanctity of the voice. Albee after ridiculing me a bit =
about my naivete regarding a new deck of cards coming with the new millenni=
um said something about the importance of the individual. The other gentlem=
an, the man that was Becket's assistant said, "To me this is the most impor=
tant question that can be asked tonight. If there is one thing that we can =
and should take from Becket is that aesthetics and ethics are one in the sa=
me." He went on to say that Becket really thought this.

The Seventh Game of the World Series
San Francisco Fringe Festival
at the Exit on Taylor
(277 Taylor at Eddy St.)
tickets: $8
Wednesday, Sept. 3, 7pm    ?   Saturday, Sept. 6,
8.30pm
Sunday, Sept. 7, 8.30pm   ?    Saturday, Sept. 13,
10pm

May 2002: New York Mets star catcher Mike Piazza,
responding to rumors, holds an impromptu press
conference before a Mets-Phillies game to tell the
world, "I'm not gay. The truth is that I'm
heterosexual and date women and that's it. End of
story." Mets GM Steve Phillips adds: "If
statistics hold up, in every clubhouse there is
somebody who is gay. So what? Who cares?"

Inspired by classic musicals, The Seventh Game of
the World Series takes this premise and runs with
it, handling the controversial issue of gay
athletes with deft humor and a genuine love for
the sport. The story itself is an entirely
plausible through-the-looking-glass take on the
world of modern baseball: Vincent Valence,
superstar shortstop for the Generals, is a rising
talent who just needs to finish the season without
incident in order to cash in on the free agent
market. But Old Man Blackstone, the owner who’s
been running the team into the ground for years,
suddenly has them in the World Series, with his
evil, Steinbrennian nephew Frank ready to take
over and move the team to Midland. All the media
attention has got Vincent feeling more and more
uncomfortable with his reputation as a
hard-drinking, hard-partying womanizer, a persona
he’s invented to hide his true sexuality. Vincent’
s boyfriend Louis is all in favor of his coming
out with the truth – except that he also happens
to be the star’s agent, and so advises Vincent to
keep walking a tightrope until he’s got him safely
signed somewhere for untold millions. But the
pressure is getting to both of them, and when the
truth of the matter gets into the wrong hands,
Vincent Valence has to make a decision that could
let down his manager -- a lovable loser who’s
waited his whole life for a shot at a Series
win -- all the rabid fans who’ve jumped on the
Generals’ bandwagon, his teammates – and himself.

Besides the coming-out story that this baseball
fantasy hinges on, The Seventh Game of the World
Series dares to ask tough questions about the game
of baseball itself, such as: Why can’t most owners
put a decent team on the field without charging an
arm and a leg for everything from bleacher seats
to watered-down beer? Why are some fans willing to
risk life and limb for any scrap of game-used
paraphernalia, no matter how bizarre? And what’s
up with some teams’ hideous uniform combos?

The first version of this piece was produced in
January 2003 during the Poets Theater Jamboree,
sponsored by Small Press Traffic at CCAC’s Timkin
Hall. David Hadbawnik (writer and director) is a
poet and performer. Stephen Berry (Vincent
Valence, star shortstop) is currently an MA
student at SFSU, enrolled in the comparative
literature department, with a major in Russian
literature. Stuart Bousel (Louis Lalime) most
recently appeared in No Nude Men’s production of
Edward II, which he also adapted and directed; his
new play, Nooze, will open in San Francisco in
November. Chris Leone (Old Man Blackstone)
produces the critically acclaimed variety show,
“The Smallest Show in Town,” and fronts The Lipsey
Mountain Spring Band. Joe Leone (Frank Blackstone)
has appeared in productions of Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead, Rumpelstiltskin, and Damn
Yankees. Other players include Adam Genser, Anne
Franklin, Perry Smith, Tanya Luckerath, Delphine
Mae, and Allison Chen. The play will also feature
a four-piece band led by Joel Behrman (Bear Cult,
United Brassworkers Front), musical director and
arranger, and lighting/stage design by Gina Leone.

[I hope to do a much fuller write-up on this book -- Pound was my first
great poetic love in high school, and I had far too many ideas about this
book than could fit in one paragraph -- so please accept this as "credit"
for the later essay.  I've put a picture up on the website:
www.arras.net/weblog]

Ezra Pound
Poems and Translations
The Library of America
ISBN: 1-931082-41-3
14,000 pages
$45

The writings of Ezra Pound have been traditionally associated with the late
James Laughlin’s avant-garde publishing venture New Directions, and volumes
such as his 1949 “collected” poems Personae, his sprawling epic The Cantos,
his thick book of Translations, and the slim, tidy distillation of Selected
Poems with its forbidding, purse-lipped profile of the poet, have been
foundational, strangely comforting features on poetry lovers’ shelves for
decades.  Containing Pound in a single, albeit huge, volume that made claims
to completism seemed impossible, and yet Richard Sieburth – best known as a
critic and translator of Holderlein – has done an amazing job of finding and
logically arranging nearly everything that Pound wrote that could be called
a poem or translation, including the juvenalia of “Hilda’s Book” – written
for fellow University of Pennsylvania student Hilda Doolittle – to the late,
moving elegy, first published in 1971, that he wrote for the brother of one
of his St. Elizabeths acolytes, but which Sieburth clearly intends for Pound
himself: “Out of the turmoil, Mother of Griefs receive him, / Queen of
Heaven receive him, / May the sound of the leaves give him peace, / May the
hush of the forest receive him.”  (1203)  That Pound could figure himself as
a seeker of peace while being, infamously, a virulent anti-Semite and
supporter of Mussolini, is just one of the conflicts that make this volume
compelling; but except in the rich chronology and footnotes that Sieburth
provides (there is, sadly, no introduction), practically none of this social
context make its presence known beyond proclivities of style: the poet's
always precise, even "macho" meters, the near absence of any intimate or
autobiographical tone, and his Puritan impatience with “Symbolist”
ambiguities – he was set on curing the world of the decadent “nineties.”
That Pound famously considered his life-work, the 800 page Cantos, a
“botch” – and took to referring to himself as a “minor satirist” during the
last years of his life as he suffered crippling depressions – makes the
verve, optimism and confidence of such undertakings as the reversionings of
Guido Cavalcanti and Arnaut Daniel (however shackled by 19th century
conventions), the robust, still fresh “Cathay” sequence, the metrical
displays of “Tenzone," “Dance Figure” and "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" and the
innovative “Homage to Sextius Propertius” – all from his richest period
before the 1920s - right through his passion for translating Sophocles and
Confucius’ Classic Anthology, seem like an Icarian flight primed for a
great, however morally distressing, fall - one that took some of American
poetry’s very thirst for hearty, internationalist undertakings with it.
Pound believed that all mankind needed to know of literature could be
contained in a two-foot shelf, and he set out translating, for a country he
thought had yet to ascend out of “barbarism,” those works that were missing;
his own place on that shelf might not be that thick – all-in-all, many of
these pages are taken up by trivial sequences like the “Alfred Venison”
poems (Cockney ballads in support of his “social credit” ideas) and the
social farce of "Moeurs Contemporaines,"  idiosyncratic “readers” versions
of Sophocles and Japanese Noh plays, and the Confucian works which crave
simplicity and wisdom but are clearly the products of a didactic, irascible
and fatally undialectic iconoclast: “He said: problem of style?  Get the
meaning across and then STOP.”  (731).  Yet one can’t help to think that the
appearance of this volume, which seems streamlined, coherent and
<i>responsible</i> compared to the many pages of The Cantos that are barely
readable due to stylistic infelicities and political excesses - compare his
work on the Analects to the "American President Cantos" - will give readers
of American poetry a sense of starting over, of renewed energy in resorting
through the horrific details of a long, ideologically wounded century and
the myriad luminous details of a few millennia of European and Asian
literature.

In June of 2003, I invited readers of the website Third Factory / Notes to
Poetry <http://www.thirdfactory.net/ensemble.html > to submit
constellations of up to eleven titles representing their own present
interests as readers.

While an emphasis on poetry titles published after 2000 was encouraged,
other items of literary, cultural, and political interest were also
welcomed.

I am grateful to everyone who made time to participate in this provisional
(and indeed radically incomplete) attempt at charting the shifting field of
our singular and collective attentions.

I invite Poetics-L readers to have a look--and drop me a line if you're
interested in participating in a year-end installment in December
03/January 04.

Best to all,

Steve Evans

Assembled titles from 29 contributors:

"What's so wrong with being Poplar?"

A forest fire in my lungs comes from pine.
National forests hide in cupboards. The larval stage,
a white legless grub, develops and feeds inside the leaves
of Poplar and other landscape trees, including Maple.
Farewell to the shade, the lazy days of picnics,
the latest bed and breakfast accommodations.

Subsequently, the shoreline was graded to make the loop road,
because of the uneven teeth along its leaf margins.

"In 'What's so wrong with being Poplar?', ryan fitzpatrick answers just that
and in the process discovers the dark, secret life of the Poplar tree. In
this world, Poplars stalk Maple trees with machetes and turn up stones to
eat termites."

14,000 pages! A conceptual piece is in order. Soon as the weather cools
down, why not organize a two column poet's brigade to meet at a designated
border town in Iraq. Each column will start with 7,000 pages each. After
determining the circumference of Iraq's borders in miles, the brigades will
walk in opposite direction to circumnavigate the entire border of Iraq. Page
by page, the brigades will mark their walk with Pound's poems, the number
for each mile being determined by 14,000 pages divided by the total number
of miles. (Quick Google research has yet to determine this circumference
figure).
Locating and placing the poems as temporary border marks, each marking will
feature a brief brigade reading of the poem in the manner of a chorus.
Morning and evening brigade discussions will focus on various issues
surrounding the Pound poems of the day (legacy - literary, political, etc.)
each of which will be taped. Encounters with Iraqi locals, United States
military personnel, topography will also be documented. Sumerian scholars -
Iraqi and non-Iraqi will be invited to reflect and contribute on the
relationship between Pound, Sumeria and contemporary discourse on the lyric,
translation and linguistic strategies in contemporary Iraq.
Each member of the pilgrimage will, of course, carry wireless computers and
maintain a reflective blog.

I am not sure what this is all about. Or is it about how does any go about
meaningfully and/or creatively reading 14,000 pages? Or how does one
pro-actively read (if that's a requirement) through what Barry W would/has
called Bad History?

Furtherfield.org are pleased to announce a new adventure.

http://www.furtherfield.org

Furtherfield has a new content management system and new design. This is th=
e
first stage in a gradual shift which will allow visitors and artist members
to contribute more dynamically to the site.

A big shout goes out to artist Chris Webb who has recently become an
essential member of Furtherfield and has left his own excellent
Pogogallery.com to join the team. He has worked with us consistently on the
new site, taking the lead in its redesign.

Also, a cute holler of intense gratitude goes out to new recruit Adrian
Eaton, the content management dude who is also currently working with Ruth
Catlow on 'Rethinking Wargames Activate'.
http://www.furtherfield.org/rcatlow/converse/documents/rethink.htm

Other new changes on the new Furtherfield site?


Visitors can now register with furtherfield and become members (no charge).


Members can now contribute dynamically to discussions about the artwork
featured on Furtherfield and receive regular updates about latest
activities.

The 'Public Broadcast' section on the home page enables visitors to upload
information about projects and events relating to digital/web/net art from
all over the world.

And yes, more artwork featured on Furtherfield

'I've developed, over the last few years, certain assumptions about softwar=
e
art. Just browse through the many entries available at runme.org
(http://runme.org/), and you, too will likely come away with some of these
assumptions: that software art is, at its heart, utilitarian; it functions,
it does something; it's tool-like; it's often more software than art.
Over the last month or so, July and August 2003, the writer Alan Sondheim
has been happily chipping away at those assumptions. - Lewis Lacook

Graffoto - Man of the Crowd/ Glowlab

'In Graffoto02, MOTC (man of the crowd) has printed out photographs of the
streets, pasted them back onto the surfaces where they were taken, and then
rephotographed them in situ. I guess that in the streets these images act a=
s
a mirror of sorts for the street artists of Brooklyn. Also as a sign that
the guttural and wonderfully articulated expressions of protest, humour,
threat and joie de vivre can be both appreciated and participated in but
also consumed by the world of mediation. These second stage images do evoke
a strange threat of surveillance.' - Ruth Catlow

Frequency Love - Chris Webb

'Frequency Love is a net art piece, not in the networked sense but
conceptually filled to the brim with a net consciousness, a net object. Thi=
s
visual deviation playfully captures the dark side of the Internet and its
globally collective and obsessive mannerist activities. It reveals a
psychological nuance of the everyday Internet sexual experience.' - Marc

'This strangely emotional work weaves finely tuned aesthetic formalism with
polemic. Unusually for Internet based media works (though not for much of
the generative Flash work made by collaborators Kate Southworth and Patrick
Simons of GloriusNinth), after an initial cascade of data, the piece unfold=
s
at an intensely slow pace, inducing a mesmeric state in the viewer and
winding down the desire to click, for the next feature.' - Ruth Catlow

of photographs which document a remarkable, satirical project in the grand
tradition of doing exactly as you are told, in order to reveal and subvert
the idiocy of national government. The shelter that Laurent built in his
home, takes as its starting point, instructions issued by the US Department
of Homeland Security in their 'Campaign for citizen preparedness'.

Anastasios,

As I ponder Waiting for Godot in my memory I can't recall any sense of an=
 ethical message in it.

It's very hard for me to place what this French director Pierre (Chabron?=
 -- I forgot the name already and am too lazy to look up the post once mo=
re, but will look it up after I've posted) meant by this phrase.  For ins=
tance, Wittgenstein said EXACTLY the same thing in the Tractatus -- in fa=
ct it is the only remark he makes about aesthetics in the ENTIRE Tractatu=
s -- "Ethics and aesthetics are one and the same."  But what he apparentl=
y meant by this was that one can't say ANYTHING intelligible about either=
 one because their domain lies outside of language in what he was dismiss=
ing at the time as the mystical.  "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one =
should remain silent!"  Later on he reverses this position and talks abou=
t the open-endedness of art (a concept that I haven't sufficiently master=
ed), but in the Tractatus he says just what your French director said abo=
ut Beckett, and said that Beckett thought. But what is meant by this?  A =
Marxist might think he meant that aesthetics was actually just ethics, bu=
t what he was in fact doing was dismissing both of them.  When you think =
of Beckett he also had a real absence of any kind of transcendent value (=
Godot never arrives), and thus maybe couldn't talk of aesthetics/ or ethi=
cs, and so maybe the director was saying that Beckett and early Wittgenst=
ein were on the same page in terms of saying that neither functioned as r=
eference points in their universe.

As for Albee -- his latest play (the man must be in his 90s) was about a =
man who divorces his wife because he has fallen in love with a goat.  Thi=
s play baffled everybody I know who saw it.  He didn't just want to have =
bestial sex with the goat, or maybe it was a sheep, I didn't see the play=
, but just read a review and talked with a number of people who went.  Th=
e male lead was completely smitten by the quadruped.  He was IN LOVE with=
 it, and adored it, and so on.  The actor who played the lead role has a =
name that I constantly forget -- he played the president in Armageddon --=
 William maybe something.  He gave an interview in which he said that he =
had no idea what the play was about, but for 75 thousand dollars a night,=
 he was willing to perform it.

yes he's alive and well.  Or so was in the last couple of years when he read poems, at least once, at New College in San Francisco.  (may be it was a few years back.  I know he read when the re-issue of Donald Allen's anthology came out.)  If my memory is accurate, he did say something along the lines of that he doesn't right much anymore and what he read went back about 30 years.  He was charming though.

For the audibles and maybe video tape, I believe Borregaard read possibly
with Robin Blazer years ago at the SF State Poetry Center in the 70's. Check
the Archives Catalog for either audio or video tape. .
Bill Berkson - I suspect - will know Borregaard's fate (with us or not). My
vague impression is that he ended up spending a lot of time in a boat off
Bolinas, fishing perhaps, which fed his poems. But anybody in the former or
present Bolinas world would know - say, Joanne Kyger, Grenier.
I also suspect - similar to Harold Dull and Rick Duerden (now passed) once
Spicer departed in 1965, the strings went dead and they never regained their
gifts on their own.  Nevertheless they created wonderful stuff while the
ripples (Waves) were strong in the circle.

Anti-transgender violence hits D.C. againGay.com / PlanetOut.com Network
Thursday, August 21, 2003 / 05:14 PM



For the second time in less than a week, a transgender woman was
brutally killed in Washington D.C. on Thursday.

Police found the victim's partially nude body in a field early Thursday
morning, the Associated Press reported. The victim, Imani Williams, had
been shot but also had severe head wounds.

Hours earlier, another transgender woman, Punani Walker, was shot in
Washington and had to be hospitalized in critical condition. Police
reportedly said the two attacks were not related.

No arrests have been made in the two incidents.

On Saturday, transgender performer Bella Evangelista was fatally shot
in what police are investigating as a potential hate crime. A suspect
for the shooting is in custody.

The Washington-based Human Rights Campaign (HRC), the nation's largest
GLBT rights advocacy group, mourned the killings.

"No person should live in fear of being attacked just because of who
they are," Elizabeth Birch, HRC's executive director, said in a
statement. "These hate crimes are vicious reminders of the work left to
be done in ensuring the safety of every member of the gay, lesbian,
bisexual and transgender community."

"In a year where 12 individuals have reportedly lost their lives to
anti-transgender violence in the United States of America," Gwen Smith,
founder of the Remembering Our Dead Project, said, "it is astounding
that we have yet to see national hate crimes protections inclusive of
gender identity."

One year ago, two Washington-area transgender teens were shot multiple
times while sitting in a parked car. The killings remain unsolved,
despite a $50,000 reward.

Here's an infamous exposé on Arnold's womanizing ways that Premiere
magazine did a couple of years back.  Until recently it was available
on the magazine's web site archives, but it seems to have been
pulled.  Luckily one can find it elsewhere on the web.  If you like
reading celebrity dirt, this is a good read.

Arnold the Barbarian

Premiere Magazine
March 2001

By John Connolly

Once, he was a box office terminator. But now that Arnold Schwarzenegger has
lost some of his muscle in Hollywood, stories of his boorish behavior can no
longer be routinely erased. Then again, he'd make a helluva politician.

The tabloid press got a nice Christmas present late last year when Arnold
Schwarzenegger tore through a day of publicity work in London, promoting his
latest film, The 6th Day, which had just opened there. In less than 24 hours,
the star was said to have attempted to, as high school boys used to say, cop a
little feel from three different female talk-show hosts. The level of
consternation expressed by those who received this hands-on treatment from the
hulking, Austrian-born international superstar ranged from none whatsoever
(Denise Van Outen of The Big Breakfast invites her guests to lie on a bed with
her and, hence, probably has a rather elastic definition of what constitutes
inappropriate behavior) to irked (on tape, Celebrity interviewer Melanie Sykes
looks a little thrown off after Arnold gives her a very definite squeeze on the
rib cage, directly under her right breast) to, finally, righteously indignant.
Anna Richardson of Big Screen claims that after the cameras stopped rolling for
her interview segment, Schwarzenegger, apparently attempting to ascertain
whether Richardson's breasts were real, tweaked her nipple and then laughed
at her objections. "I left the room quite shaken," she says. "What was
more upsetting was that his people rushed to protect him and scapegoated me,
and not one person came to apologize afterward."

No apologies, indeed: A subsequent statement from Schwarzenegger attorney
Martin Singer characterized Richardson as someone trying to get her "15
minutes of fame." After all, why else would she create such an "outrageous
fabrication" (Singer's phrase) against a married man-Schwarzenegger has
been wed to NBC's Maria Shriver since 1986-a father of four, someone who
ceaselessly espouses family values in the press? On the other hand, the stills
of Schwarzenegger grinning as he pats Van Outen's hip or of his
give-me-some-sugar-baby expression as he tries to draw Sykes close to him are a
little unsettling. Was Arnold jet-lagged? Going through a midlife crisis?

"You don't get it," says a producer who's worked with Schwarzenegger.
"That's the way Arnold always behaves. For some reason, [this time] the
studio or the publicists couldn't put enough pressure on the women to kill
the story."

Terminating bad press was once relatively easy for Schwarzenegger, who for much
of the '80s and a good part of the '90s was a veritable money-making
machine for the studios. And while some of his most recent films have enjoyed
less-than-stellar box office performances, he is still a very huge star and one
of the highest-paid actors in the world: He reportedly received $25 million for
his work in the 1999 disappointment End of Days. Accordingly, Schwarzenegger
films are always big-budget affairs; as such, they provide lots of jobs to lots
of people and generate lots of money to lots of studio suits and other
peripheral players. Arnold is not just a rich movie star; he's the straw that
stirs the drinks. The sort of person, in other words, who tends to get
indulged. A lot.

"The second I walked into the room," Anna Richardson says, several weeks
after the incident, "he was like a dog in heat." Other stories about
Schwarzenegger tend to fit her simile. During the production of the 1991
mega-blockbuster Terminator 2: Judgment Day, a producer on that film recalls
Arnold's emerging from his trailer one day and noticing a fortyish female
crew member, who was wearing a silk blouse. Arnold went up to the woman, put
his hands inside her blouse, and proceeded to pull her breasts out of her bra.
Another observer says, "I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This
woman's nipples were exposed, and here's Arnold and a few of his clones
laughing. I went after the woman, who had run to the shelter of a nearby
trailer. She was hysterical but refused to press charges for fear of losing her
job. It was disgusting."

A former Schwarzenegger employee recalls another incident from the T2 days. At
the time, director James Cameron was married but having an affair with one of
the film's stars, Linda Hamilton. One evening, while riding in a limo with
Cameron, Hamilton, and others, Schwarzenegger suddenly lifted Hamilton onto his
lap and began fondling her breasts through the very thin top she was wearing.
The witness says, "I couldn't believe Cameron didn't have the balls to
tell Arnold to get off his girl. The whole thing made me sick."

A female producer on one of Schwarzenegger's films tells of a time when her
ex-husband came to visit the set. When she introduced the man to
Schwarzenegger, the star quipped, "Is this guy the reason why you didn't
come up to my hotel room last night and suck my cock?"

A woman who went to the set of 1996's Eraser recalls the friend she was
visiting there being asked to retrieve Schwarzenegger from his trailer for a
shot that was ready to roll earlier than expected. "He asked me if I wanted
to meet Arnold, and I said sure. When we opened the door to his trailer, Arnold
was giving oral sex to a woman. He looked up and, with that accent, said very
slowly, 'Eating is not cheating.' I met him again about a year later and
asked him, in German, whether or not eating was cheating, and he just
laughed."

It's clearly convenient for a guy who preaches family values in interviews-
particularly when he's promoting the Inner-City Games Foundation, his youth
charity, and citing single parenting as a major social woe-to have some loose
parameters as to what constitutes cheating on one's wife. (It depends on what
your definition of define is.) By some accounts, Maria Shriver has not had it
all that easy. Two people witnessed an incident at a 7 a.m. tennis game that
Mr. and Mrs. Schwarzenegger were playing at their hotel, during the shooting of
Total Recall. One of the witnesses says, "Maria started throwing up. She
couldn't play, and Arnold started berating her and then stomped off the
court. At noon that day, the smiling couple announced that Maria was
pregnant." Schwarzenegger was also seen carrying on with his Total Recall
costar Rachel Ticotin. A journalist who once accompanied the (then) married
Ticotin and Schwarzenegger on an evening out says, "The three of us had gone
to dinner, where the two of them were all lovey-dovey. We then went to a
nightclub, but I left to go back to the Hotel Nikko México soon thereafter.
When I left them, they were making out and were all over each other on a
banquette. The next day, I saw Arnold and Maria strolling out of the elevator.
Maria gave me the look a married woman does when she knows that you know her
husband is cheating on her. I felt terrible for her."

A lot of people must feel the same. A lawyer who frequents Café Roma, a
Beverly Hills bistro that is a hangout for real and wannabe wiseguys, says,
"When ever I see Schwarzenegger and his crew [walk into the place], I leave
quickly and go to another restaurant. This guy is a real pig. He will say the
most disgusting sexual things to women he doesn't know. Everybody knows he is
Arnold Schwarzenegger. . . . But in any other city, somebody would have cracked
him by now." In Hollywood, though, nobody cracks a billion-dollar box office
gorilla.

Schwarzenegger's extraordinary rise to international stardom can be traced
back to the release of the 1977 documentary Pumping Iron, directed by George
Butler and Robert Fiore. The film, an extension of the book of the same title,
about the world of bodybuilding competitions, portrays Schwarzenegger in a
fascinating light; the practically Machiavellian way he psychs out contest
opponent Lou Ferrigno (the muscleman who later went on to portray the
Incredible Hulk on television) is something to behold. (As is a prior film of
Schwarzenegger's, 1970's Hercules in New York, a no-budget Z-picture that
paired the muscleman, appearing in the title role under the stage name Arnold
Strong, with archetypal nebbish Arnold Stang.)

It wasn't until 1982's Conan the Barbarian that Arnold demonstrated his box
office drawing power. Conan producer Edward R. Pressman says, "We signed
Arnold to a three-picture deal, which called for him to be paid $250,000 for
the first film and the same for each sequel. The movie turned into a monster
hit, and we sold our sequel rights. I'm sure Arnold was able to renegotiate
his salary for the sequels." Within just a few short years, he was on his way
to becoming one of the highest-paid movie stars in history. Because he has
achieved such an enormous level of respectability and credibility, it's easy
to forget that early in his Hollywood career, he was seen by many as a walking
cartoon, if not an out-and-out joke. (He might have experienced an unpleasant
frisson while costarring in a 1980 TV-movie biopic of Jayne Mansfield, playing
Mickey Hartigay, Mansfield's bodybuilder-turned-actor husband, who spent the
latter portion of his acting career in such ultra-shlocky Italian horror pics
as The Bloody Pit of Horror.) As do most megastars, Schwarzenegger has a
retinue of agents, managers, advisors, and hangers-on (to whom he has often
demonstrated great loyalty; his former agent Lou Pitt recalls that über-agent
Mike Ovitz "tried to steal my client Arnold from me any number of times-he
was all over Arnold like a cheap suit!" but that Arnold brushed Ovitz aside,
staying with Pitt for almost 15 years). Still, he has largely made his own
decisions. He has always done it, as the song says, his way. Which is entirely
in keeping with his self-image.

"I was born to be a leader. I love being a leader," he told Britain's
Loaded magazine two years ago. He's not the only person impressed with his
alpha-male mien. "He has a completely single-minded style. It is his agenda
or no agenda," says a longtime associate of Schwarzenegger's. A producer
who worked with Arnold on True Lies says, "Arnold is incredible. At one of
the marketing meetings, Arnold got up and spoke and not only knew the direction
we should take in marketing the film, but was so full of confidence, he
inspired everyone in the room." But confidence can cut a lot of different
ways, and Schwarzenegger's can manifest itself cruelly. During the filming of
Terminator 2, Schwarzenegger had a dresser who, it was generally conceded, had
not been hired for his looks. Often, in front of the whole crew, Arnold would
order the man, "Sit, you ugly dog," and the man would drop to his knees
like a trained dog. Crew members would laugh, perhaps nervously, but no one
spoke up in protest. The man was finally put out of his misery when a producer
witnessed the spectacle-and fired the man rather than allow him to continue
to be abused by Schwarzenegger.

"I love the fact that millions of people look up to me," Schwarzenegger
told Loaded. One reason people continue to look up to him is because he-and
the people around him-have been so successful at hiding the real Arnold from
the world. The star cleaned house several years ago, not only letting go of Lou
Pitt but also longtime publicist Charlotte Parker, who, for years, had
reputedly been a veritable bull when it came to protecting her client. In 1990,
Team Schwarzenegger attempted to derail the publication of an unauthorized
biography of Schwarzenegger by Wendy Leigh. At the time, Leigh was engaged in a
lawsuit with Schwarzenegger over her contribution to a piece about the star in
Britain's News of the World; she was offered a settlement on the condition
that, among other things, she not publish the book. She didn't accept that
condition; the suit was settled some time later. Charles Fleming reported in
Spy magazine that before Leigh's book was published, Franco Columbu, a
longtime bodybuilding associate of Schwarzenegger's, offered Leigh's
publisher, Contemporary Books, the choice of either a large amount of money or
an "authorized" bio, written with Arnold, if it would agree to cancel
Leigh's book. Contemporary Books refused. Once Arnold: An Unauthorized
Biography was published, Parker went into overdrive to bury it. Fleming wrote,
"When Time did a cover story on Arnold and was granted an interview, Parker
explained that the interview would be ended instantly if the reporters
introduced the subject of Leigh's book."

A source close to Parker says, "When Charlotte couldn't kill a story about
one of Arnold's infidelities, he canned her." Parker had done her best. The
story was originally slated to be a feature on a television entertainment-news
show; it wound up as a small gossip-column item that didn't make many waves.
(When Parker, who no longer does publicity for the star or the Arnold Classic,
a Schwarzenegger-affiliated bodybuilding competition, was first approached
about this story, she said that she would answer specific questions; later, she
politely demurred: "I prefer to not participate in your story."
Schwarzenegger, too, declined repeated requests to be interviewed for this
article.)

Schwarzenegger and his people have also been able to use the ever-intertwining
tendrils of media conglomeration to their benefit. A onetime reporter for the
now-defunct tabloid TV show Hard Copy recalls, "I had been working on a story
about Arnold's use of steroids. Hard Copy was owned by Paramount. I was told,
in no uncertain terms, to forget the story. Paramount was afraid that if we did
the story, they would never get Arnold to do a film."

The old saw says that if you've got your health, you've got everything. It
is probable that this man, once named chairman of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness by the first Bush Administration, is not as healthy as he
would like the public to believe.

In April of 1997, Arnold's then publicist, Catherine Olim, informed the world
that Arnold had undergone elective heart surgery to replace an aortic valve, at
the USC University Hospital in Los Angeles. In a statement attributed to the
then 49-year-old star, he assured his fans, "Choosing to undergo open-heart
surgery when I never felt sick was the hardest decision I've ever made. I can
now look forward to a long, healthy life with my family." Olim told the press
that the operation was to correct a congenital heart condition. "Steroids,"
she declared, "have nothing to do with this."

But Pumping Iron director George Butler, who shot 6,000 still pictures of
bodybuilder Arnold in various poses before he started work on either the book
or the movie, and who has maintained a relationship with Schwarzenegger for
more than 20 years, says, "During the operation, doctors removed his heart
from his body and replaced one of the heart valves with a pig valve. During his
recovery, he was rushed back to the operating room, where the doctors again
removed his heart and implanted two more pig valves."

A patient undergoing valve-replacement surgery has several options. An aortic
valve can be replaced by the patient's own pulmonic valve, after which a
valve taken from a pig replaces the pulmonic valve. Mechanical valves are also
an option. The advantage of using pig valves, according to Dr. Leonard Girardi,
assistant professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Manhattan's New York Weill
Cornell Medical Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital, is that "you do not
need to be on blood thinners; you could just take an aspirin [which acts as a
blood thinner] and that would be sufficient." The kind of medication required
to maintain a mechanical valve, Girardi says, doesn't jibe well with an
athletic lifestyle. Still, pig valves have a downside: They deteriorate. "A
pig valve, in general, will last an average of 12 years or so. I have seen them
last as long as 20 years." This is not necessarily an issue for a patient who
undergoes the procedure at age 78; but Schwarzenegger's surgery occurred
several months before his 50th birthday.

Carla Ferrigno, the wife of bodybuilder Lou, has, like Butler, known
Schwarzenegger for more than 20 years; she says, "It's funny how he is
trying to change history." She says she has spoken to two doctors who were in
the operating room during Schwarzenegger's procedures, and the account she
heard squares with Butler's.

A doctor who's friendly with the Kennedys (Schwarzenegger's wife is a
Kennedy niece) says he is well-acquainted with the details of the operations
and speculates that Schwarzenegger's medical problems might be related to his
use of anabolic steroids during the years he was a bodybuilder. Another doctor,
Alan Leshner, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in
Bethesda, Maryland, describes some of the effects of steroid use: "Steroids
interfere with protein function; they work by promoting protein growth and body
mass. At the same time, they are all related to androgens in one way or
another. So if you put on a big protein load, you could have kidney trouble. .
. . You could have cardiovascular problems because it affects the heart as
well."

Over the years Schwarzenegger has either downplayed the amount of steroids he
used (in a 1987 interview in Playboy, he said, "I don't worry about it,
because I never took an overdosage") or skirted the question entirely. But
Wendy Leigh's book goes into detail about his use of the drug, as does True
Myths, British film critic Nigel Andrews's book on Schwarzenegger. According
to Andrews, Austrian bodybuilder and trainer Kurt Marnul introduced Arnold to
steroids in the old country. In the book, Marnul said, "There was no weight
lifter in the world who did not take them. You could get prescriptions for them
from the doctor. Arnold never took them, though, without my supervision."
When asked, "Was Arnold taking them?" in Andrews's book, the late Vince
Gironda, owner of Vince's Gym in North Hollywood-where Arnold first trained
when he moved to California-replied, "Is a frog's ass waterproof?"
(Schwarzenegger has hedged about drug use in other ways as well. In the Playboy
interview, he denied ever having used any kind of recreational drug; yet in
Pumping Iron, there's a sequence showing Arnold basking in the glory of his
Mr. Olympia win, enjoying what George Butler says was a substantial joint.)

Despite the diminishing domestic box office returns of his pictures, studios
still pony up big bucks for Schwarzenegger's services. He is still slated to
star in Terminator 3, though the possibility of its being made seems to grow
dimmer with every announcement or news story. The fact that his star may be
waning has led to renewed speculation that Arnold the Kennedy might pull a
Ronald Reagan. Schwarzenegger has long espoused right-wing politics-he
campaigned furiously for George Bush in 1988, concocting (or at least
pronouncing) the infamous sound bite, "I only play the Terminator. When it
comes to the American future, Michael Dukakis will be the real Terminator!"
He's also often hinted that he might eventually seek political office. In the
Loaded article, he said, "In America I could go all the way to Speaker of the
House. I think I could bring a little spice to the job. I think I could put a
little fire up their asses." The governership of California has been
mentioned; that would be another jewel in the crown, another fitting step-up in
a life story so amazing that if you had made it up, nobody would have believed
it. In a recent interview with Christina Valhouli of Salon.com, Schwarzenegger
dances around the question of whether he will run for political office. In
answering her question, "Is it true that you're thinking of running for
Governor of California?" Schwarzenegger replies, "I have thought about it
many times in the past, but I have no specific plans at this point." Perhaps
he knows to quit while he's ahead.

Anastasios,

The guy who said that "Aesthetics and ethics are one in the same" -- in the work of Beckett is Pierre Chabert, as you told me by follow-up backchannel.  Oddly I just got a flier for a Beckett conference to be held on October 9-12 at the University of Delaware and he is prominent in the flier.  He will do a one-man show of Krapp's Last Tape in French on October 9 at 8pm, and then will speak on Dircting Beckett at 10:45 am on October 11.  Chabert is listed as a protege (sorry, monolingual keyboard) of Beckett.  There's a lot of other heavyweight Beckettians there, plus an exhibitions in the library etc etc.  Maybe somebody who can get to Newark, Delaware should go and ask him what he meant by aesthetics and ethics being the same thing, or being one in the same.  I've never been to Delaware.  Is it pleasant at the University of Delaware?  The website for the Beckett events:

Dear poetry buffs: I'm looking for current research on the
impact of Canadian poetry migration to the scenes of
writing in the continental United States during the
early-to-mid-1990s. Please post references to this

Gwyn McVay writes, "You know who I hate? I hate haters."

To which I say (albeit, "the obvious"), Anti-Right-on!  Well, ya know,
poets'/intellectuals'/artists' entire tradition and training/shaping in life
works against and practically precludes "hating," but this IS, after all, a
basic human feeling or emotion (or mental state).  And what counts, as with
all "feelings," is how one acts in response to embodying such
feeling/emotion (with responsibility, without etc).

I look forward over the coming years to seeing numerous poets/artists
"embracing," as opposed to retroflecting, "hate" for the haters and for
anti-social expressions of "hate."  I think it's a terribly
under-appreciated and under-represented "emotion," one "Lefties" and
"Progressives" and poets sometimes too readily repress.  And there's the
pseudo-Zen sort of perspective that would encourage fighting hate with Love,
focusing entire energy on Love (and Beauty, too), using that kind of
deliberate method for subtracting from rather than adding to "the
hate/hatred in the world."  "Understanding," too, is a preferred (and of
course useful) approach.

Still, perhaps too "rational" and "humanistic" a perspective relegates
"hating" to haters like the homophobes and the racists and their ilk and for
the more sensitive unconstructively precludes hating.  Personally, I believe
that "hating" and "hate" are ripe territories presently under-explored, too
readily (or maybe "excessively") self-regulated, and in fact deserving of
some, any kind of (new?) actualization(s).

(These thoughts, kinds of, notwithstanding, the fact that "a body imbued
with 'care'" can only "embody" just so much "hate," so much wise thought/art
would argue that no (one's) body need embody any hate in a life(time).  Yes,
a lot of "splits," here, evidence that this erratic "hater" (of
haters/hate/oppressors) sure as heck hasn't got the problem solved yet, not
in these times, certainly.

Gwyn,
  so far this year I think the number of trans murders is 15,
http://www.gender.org/remember/day/who.html

hate crimes are up since bush entered the office of supreme commander,
and the vast majority of  hate crimes are against trans individuals.
There is a wonderful article by Riki Wilchins (gender pac:
http://www.gpac.org/) in the back of the advocate about oppression of
gender expression .. is not just a trans problem folks... its time to
wake up.

  trans murders never make the news so no one knows how many and how
brutal. (23 or 24 last year). and is just the tip of the silent ice
berg of gender oppression. I mean truly why do we believe a only men
can have penises and woman vaginas... why can't a man have vagina.. and
for that matter what is a man or a women...  this country enforces
gender by the laws and by violence..

to your question is there a trans killer out there? there are many out
there who when they spot a slight gender variance in someone will
inflict harm, even murder...... ask any dyke, drag queen, trans,
someone to small or to big... not doing the right job or has a deep
voice or to high of a voice... or what ever...

Of interest here might be Hugh Kenner's remarks out of
THE COMMUNITY OF ELSEWHERE (I think it is? - recent book of radio lectures-) or maybe it's out of THE MECHANIC MUSE where he relates that WAITING FOR GODOT is pretty much literally "about" Beckett's experiences in Occupied France as a translator for the underground resistance... that there were instances when one would have to arrive at a specified location and simply wait while trying not to look to suspicious... perhaps what Chabert's getting at is the necessity of aesthetics and ethics being one in the same under such conditions...

Oddly I just got a flier for a Beckett conference to be held on October 9-12 at the University of Delaware and he is prominent in the flier.  He will do a one-man show of Krapp's Last Tape in French on October 9 at 8pm, and then will speak on Dircting Beckett at 10:45 am on October 11.  Chabert is listed as a protege (sorry, monolingual keyboard) of Beckett.  There's a lot of other heavyweight Beckettians there, plus an exhibitions in the library etc etc.  Maybe somebody who can get to Newark, Delaware should go and ask him what he meant by aesthetics and ethics being the same thing, or being one in the same.  I've never been to Delaware.  Is it pleasant at the University of Delaware?  The website for the Beckett events:

two-dollar antelopes,
do you salty hair snug of midnights wear?
did the sky kill off your misnamed skulking?
it's only chariots o'clock, & already are
the nymphs' bellies torn to make room for
rusted rabbits -- a nest of falling tongues
writhed from due thirst, will you rustle them
to some bounce-soft bed far from nutty words?
I would, but my mouth's woolen from drifting skies
& quite breakfast-frantic

being pulled out and letting go or on the heels of everything before
the monkey signs the release

I was light  - was a dawdling roof, an autumn darkness, a little later
. . . a vale looking towards a remembered silence - lonely fragile
mars, but distant, afraid of time as my mind slipped to another poised
on a pedestals edge of sanity - readily aware of a limpid mirror, from
floor to ceiling, a mirror at the bottom of the sea. out of the depths
through the thickness of satin a sculptured face I do not recognize, a
signal in anguish black bloodied and whole - directions in morse code
modification, a bar code on the street, in a cell,  a prisoner in
infinity. those are the moments, when I no longer belong to myself.
vanished in potholes of a serving tray carrying cheap initiation
pressed glass, a leitmotiv of cruel gestures that rips the meat from my
teeth. I languish in a book or a film or a weapon grade stockpile of
something  - touch a morsel of a distant something that wipes the
refuge from my dishes. us a little bleach and water. add  some golden
trellis work, scents and warm fruit and give birth to elsewhere as the
lithium rises.

On the Organization and Disorganization of Files

The website at http://www.asondheim.org/ has been revamped, the portal
(home) (index,html) page removed; instead there is a directory for the
Internet Text with a 00README1st.txt as introduction. The result is a
field of varied files - .txt or the double-letter files such as ab, mx,
etc. which are also texts - various video formats (avi, mov, asf) - sound,
programs, .exe executables, and so forth.

If there is a resulting organization, it is in the form of the name
itself, what follows in parallel, for example the archaea series or the
Poly series.

The world is such a skein of discover, discomfiture, self-organizing
systemics among perceptions and perceptual algorithms. Here, one employs
the same; everything is available, the extensions guiding format and
sense, the contents interrelated across extensions through parallel names.

Please check out both the http://www.asondheim.org/ and the portal
directory at http://www.asondheim.org/portal . The latter contains more
multi-media; the two, however, interpenetrate, connected only by the waist
or spinal cord/chord of the directory structure itself.

The clear contents, the clarity of the contents. Fields and intensities.
Distributivities...

Conservatory Stop

Objectifications of David Bowie and Madonna a la mode. A pie with tabloids
and torn tendons and fine meals taken out of trash bins served with warmth
from the summer sun.

Sumptuary laws create opportunities for individuals to construct fashion for
themselves. Flexibility of self-representation modernity are forged from the
shared evaluation of aesthetic bruises.

Emphasizing seductiveness Cartesian formulation cult of celebrity using
figures such as polymorphic sexuality.  The grey areas are the most
important.

Permeable identity questioning stable boundaries of techno bodies.  A nip
and a tuck and we are full again.

Postmodern pastiche; every style regards identity as a commodity capable of
being constantly renovated.  On those TV shows the renovations make everyone
happy and fill them with joy.

Assumptions of the self, precipitates a deeper scrutinizing of key cultural
constructs. The construction of houses is temporary and creates an
artificial place.

Conventionally  with prized metaphysical qualities such as character and
morality?  Sapeurs have long understood that goods are always culturally
coded.

Contextualizing urban fashion provides a means of acquiring multiple lives.
What are they thinking? What are they wearing? Why yell so loud?

Transformative properties of fashion are an expectation of every new
purchase.

Proscriptiveness no longer appeal because the desire for a stable
interiorized sense of identity

Cannibalization of fashion every position on the political spectrum
continues is part of sartorial cycle.  Cannibals are what we are now
Eating our young to satiate ourselves.

Ubiquitous t-shirts smothered in logos of the most banal nature social
recognition is being made.

Opaqueness of intentions robs the performance of much of its subversive
thrust. Ornamentation and innovation continually reinvent subjectivity.

Ok a question it has been argued that WWI in part gave relavancy to poetic
modernism and then that movement broke into three with Pound going right,
various going left and Eliot becoming a conservative, it has also been
argued that WWII gave birth to post modernism, so where do we go from 9/11
if the 20th century began in Sarajevo in 1914 and ended in New York on
9/11/2001 we now need a poetic response to the new century/world we live in
now--- I dont think that standard left/right, or poetic movement answers
e.g. language, surrealist et cetera really are relevant to our current
situation-- I think that a new poetic/poetics needs to be born and i think
much of the baggage from the end of the 20th century is getting in the way--
so where do we go from here? How do we dialogue? Is poetry relevant since so
much of it comes out of an academia that is totally ignored by the US
Government (from the left and the right) and by the new "enemy",

I ask this because poets and poetry have been seen as part of movements in
the past 100 years, Lorca and Alberti and Spanish Republicanism, Marinetti,
D'Annunzio and Pound and Fascism, Eliot and Conservatism and Christian
Reaction, Cardenal and Liberation Theology, Neruda and many others and
Marxism and Third World ism but I feel like I am wandering in the dark room
since 9/11 trying to see where poets fit and what is the poetics for the
21st century, our century.

well, I think that this is a time of maintenance.  media, such as
television, cinema, the internet, programming, etc, that is in its formative
years (contra literature, painting, etc) has overtaken the public
imagination lately but this will pass.  and so poets, writers, have to keep
doing what their doing.  it is almost irrelevant that governments have paid
little attention.  in order to maintain a community of writers that extends
forward as much as back, it is necessary to keep writing in the face of
social apathy, indifference, and subordination to new media forms, even if
only to sustain a presence until a time when these media lose their
importance based on newness.  if we spend too much time being after an
audience, after a share of the entertainment/cultural market then our
actions will smack of desperation.  simply be continuing to write will stand
as a social response once enough time has passed to allow people to see the
times we are living through clearly.  in terms of a poetics for the 21st
century, I'm not so sure a name is necessary when taxonomic impulses lead to
much larger dangers (control through identity, once something is named it
becomes susceptible to manipulation and control, etc...).  I guess it is
ineveitable that some collective term will rise to encompass groups of
writers from responses to their work, in the interest of scholarly
discussion say, but the important thing would be that such a stance comes
from the outside.

some rambling thots from a pain addled brain.  wisdom tooth extractions are

jason,

we should write,
that's true, but not because
nor to spite
those who would pause
taking stock of our thoughts;
rather,
we need appease the crowds.=20

That politics
and politicians slaughter lambs
appeasing leaders
of the left and right,
is a simple fact=20
that will neither change worlds,
nor move mountains. =20

Yet,
it is clear
man made mountains
shall be moved
and men and lambs both
will bleed stark and startling blood
upon the altars of the now changed world
and poets forever more must cry...

Well, this is to assume the 9/11/2001, or as most of the world says,
11/9/2001, is that large an event. It certainly was a large event in
the USA, no question of that. But in that other countries face that
sort of thing over and over, one has to wonder whether maybe we
should wait a while to see what seems to be the event that heralded
the 21st century or whenever. It is possible that the 21st century
will not be the US's century. With the powerful brats in power there
now, and according to signs most of us have seen, the US empire may
be on the way out. Whether that happened as a result of 11/9/2001,
will be an interesting question.

Again I keep on saying and will keep on saying, there _are_ new responses
and presences, but _not_ from the more or less traditional poetics or
poetry community; just look at the work on wryting, or that going on in
the Unstable Digest etc. etc. etc. Many of us are working with
distributivities, all sorts of language transformations and dynamics,
performativities, laptop performance, codework, markov chains, etc. Look
at Mez work, solipsis, Meskens, MWP, nn, etc. There's theory by Talan
Memmott, Florian Cramer, Mez, and others.

This is probably not writing that you would recognize as such, but it is
certainly a poetry and poetics that is responsive to world-wide
interconnectivity and it's holes, confusions, coherencies,
inconsistencies, alphabetics, etc. And no, this is not post-Oulipo work,
but semantics work, and it's occurring now, what what constantly surprises
me is how little this list, and other poetry/poetics lists responds to it,
as if the electronics, networking, languages, etc. etc. are simply add-ons
to tradition.

That's very right, George, though I'm not sure about that augur your using
as I haven't seen any signs the US is "on the way out". And as for your
calendar..

The attacks on the World Trade Center (and the Pentagon) seem to have been
grossly essential zed by the Ango-European media (though I suspect it's not
just the media, as this enquiry suggests). Others on this list have said
that the major impact of the attacks was their symbolic and aesthetic
dimension, which I think is very true. And I'm sure not many have forgotten
Stockhausen's comment that the attacks were the greatest artwork of the
devil -- incidentally, he did say the devil, not just art as was reported in
the media at the time. Personally, I feel quite uneasy about the 'devil'
aspect of this and the associations one makes with gwb's redundant good and
evil, axis of evil etc, but Stockhausen has a point. The real terror
unleashed by these attacks has been the political rhetoric and the version
of reality that it has helped to produce. There was plenty of violence
against states before "9/11" but that violence has now been subsumed under
America's banner terrorism. If 9/11 can be considered on one level a work of
art, then what we've seen since then has been its horrible imitations -- the
artwork of the devil indeed (understood as a malignant 'force' since I am
both an atheist and aware that devil does not carry such dark connotations
as the church believes). "Shock and awe" as 9/11 pt2? "America Strikes Back"
as the political comics had it?

It seems that actually 9/11 has become more like an antithetical Valentines
Day more than anything else. That is, 9/11 is a commercial day and an emblem
of commercial power that both sells itself and promotes state sanctioned
hate in the image of compassion and safety.

Dear Poeticists,

I have just been slapped with an extra section this fall, Writing for the
Web, and know that there are buttloads of poetry hypertexts linked from
the EPC and the works of Alan Sondheim (of whom I remain a fan, goddamnit)
and August Highland.

If anybody knows of a big fat concatenated group of links to such
resources, and you send this to me front-channel or back, I will write a
praise poem about you.

Bests, Gwyn McVay

Gwyn.  You may want to nail down a definition of what your are thinking
of as hypertext poetry.  Depending on who you talk to not all poetry
written in & for an electronic medium is hypertext poetry.  Personally
I dont think of Alan or August's work as hypertext poetry overall tho I
would guess that they probably have created hypertextual works at some
point.  Usually a hypertext work has an architecture of links & nodes
as integral to the reading of the work.

Here's a couple resources to get you started:

word circuits (check out the Directory of Electronic Lit)
http://wordcircuits.com/

webartery member sights (hypertext mixed with every other flavor of
electronic writing)
http://webartery.com/defib/webarterymembers.htm

gywn,

i've found the following helpful:


http://www.hphoward.demon.co.uk/poetry/hypelink.htm
maintained by peter howard in the UK, this has links to about 34 sites
that range from featuring the work of individuals to being additional
metalinks.

http://dmoz.org/Arts/Literature/Poetry/Interactive
the dmoz open directory project has tons of links and other headings
you can browse under

http://www.burningpress.org/wreyeting/
the wr-eye-tings scratchpad on luigi-bob drake's site has some
innaresting work by a number of listfolks

http://www.ubu.com/
ubu is probably the single best source for contemporary and historical
concrete visual sound and performance poetries

happy surfing and turn yr speakers up! and if you must i'd rather an
aspersion-poem than praise-poem.

bests,
t.

Dear Poeticists,

I have just been slapped with an extra section this fall, Writing for
the Web, and know that there are buttloads of poetry hypertexts linked
from the EPC and the works of Alan Sondheim (of whom I remain a fan,
goddamnit) and August Highland.

If anybody knows of a big fat concatenated group of links to such
resources, and you send this to me front-channel or back, I will write a
praise poem about you.

Bests, Gwyn McVay

Haroldo de Campos, 73, Form-Bending Poet, Dies
By SIMON ROMERO


Haroldo de Campos, who transformed words into whimsical diagrams
and subtle critiques of formal poetry as a founder of the 1950's Concrete
poetry movement in Brazil, died Aug. 16 in São Paulo. He was 73.

The cause was complications of diabetes, the newspaper O Globo reported.

Mr. de Campos was perhaps the best known of the Brazilian Concrete poets,
who often arranged the letters of the words in their poems in shapes that would
lend them multiple meanings.

The Concretists arrived on the international literary scene as Brazil, imbued with
the modernism that also resulted in the completion of the planned capital Brasília
in 1960, flirted with different artistic forms.

With his brother, Augusto, and with Décio Pignatari, Mr. de Campos formed a
group that sought to create a new form of expression by removing stereotypical
traces of Brazilian culture from their work.

One result was a cosmopolitan body of writing that reflected the pragmatic,
gritty industrialism of São Paulo and that drew visual inspiration from European
artists like Mondrian and Brancusi.

The Cuban writer Severo Sarduy called Mr. de Campos the "Pound-like patriarch"
of the Concrete poets, in reference to the poet Ezra Pound.

Haroldo Eurico Browne de Campos was born to a middle-class family in São Paulo
in 1929 and graduated from the University of São Paulo with a law degree. He
shunned the legal profession, however, preferring to risk his hand at literary
experimentation.

A prolific essayist, translator and polyglot, Mr. de Campos translated works into
Portuguese from Chinese, German, Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, English, Italian, Japanese,
Russian, Latin and Provençal. In doing so, he often adopted a freewheeling practice
called transcreation, which allowed him to intersperse translations with his own ideas.

Mr. de Campos's translations sometimes took the form of literary collaborations, as
in "Transblanco," a 1986 work in which he drew on correspondence and discussions
with the Mexican poet Octavio Paz to produce a Brazilian version of Paz's poetry.

The Mexican government awarded Mr. de Campos the Octavio Paz Prize in 1999.

Mr. de Campos had widespread influence on Brazilian popular music, with composers
like Caetano Veloso basing songs on his poems.

Mr. de Campos is survived by his wife, Carmen, and a son, Ivan.

another suggestion is to use books from Coach House Books and then look at
the web renderings of these books as they are on their site. this might
form an interesting bridge.

Dodie Bellamy's Fall Prose Workshop

I will be leading a fall prose workshop, which will meet 10 Monday
evenings in my South of Market apartment from 7 to 10.  The dates:
September 29 through December 1.

By prose I mean fiction, nonfiction, prose poetry, cross-genre (and
cross-gender) writing including (but not exclusively) anything edgy
or experimental.  It's a good place to present work that feels too
risky or sexy or queer for academic workshops.  The workshops are
totally open-ended.  Five people present a week, scheduling that the
week ahead.  Usually people bring in something 5 pages or less
(copies for everybody) and we critique it that week.  Longer pieces
are also okay, but they need to be handed out a week ahead of time
for people to read.  Each student typically gets a half an hour each
time we critique.  The classes are limited to 8 students.  Lots and
lots of personal attention.  They take place in my South of Market
apartment, which comes complete with snacks and one cat.

I'm the author of 4 books and I teach creative writing at SF State
and in the MFA program at Antioch Los Angeles.  In the spring I'll be
teaching at CalArts.  I've also taught at Naropa summer session,
Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.  I'm the winner
of the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the Firecracker
Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about cost, work samples, etc.
Or--if you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this
email along to them.

Alan:

I fully agree with you on the importance these "new responses and
presences," and that poets and critics aren't giving them their due. They
address the medium on its own terms. They challenge our notion of what art
is in this Digital Age. But this reaction, this resistance, is as old as art
itself. There were artists in the Upper Paleolithic who said, "What's that
crap on the walls?!"

This is the best question asked in the last six months to my mind.  The two big
answers on the board now seem to be Marxism and Calvinism.  The Democrats are
more and more finding their answers in socialism of various kinds (although they
aren't announcing this -- most feminists, multiculturalists, etc., have found
their justification in Marx, and Marxism -- and it's very clear in the academic
texts).  On the other side there are the Calvinists -- Southern Baptists like
Bush and most of his circle, plus a good percentage of other Christians in this
country.

There are other groups but I don't think either one is as zealous as these two
groups, nor are they as powerful.

What I see in them as a unifying quality is that they are one-kingdom
responses.  That is, Marxists laugh about the idea of another higher world.
This seems to be in one sense a response to the church's own wrong-doings -- and
also to the idea that the church asked the poor to wait until the next kingdom
for justice.  It's understandable.  But what happens to ideas like the Ten
Commandments, and other basic ideas of justice?  They are wiped off the board.
Then, when you look at the Calvinists, they want Christ's kingdom to take place
right now on earth.  This drives me crazy because we are filled with animal
lusts, need to eat, etc., and yet I haven't seen manna fall from the sky lately.

In contrast to these ideas is the Lutheran idea of two kingdoms.  I can't prove
this but I think it is at least partially implied in the separation of church
and state.  It's originally set up by Augustine to deal with the problem of
being an imperial power and yet Christian.  It's absurdly difficult to treat in
a note like this.  But it's the animating idea behind the Scandinavian welfare
states such as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.  Unlike Marxist or
Calvinist states that argue that we should be good all the time and help
everybody else, Lutheranism argues that we have to take care of ourselves and
our families first.

Almost in a humorous way I'd like to launch this idea as a possible idea as an
underpinning and ethics in American poetics.  Partially because it's so
laughable to think that poets would ever take up a Christian idea.

Where it seems to me that it has real-world efficacity is that it separates the
perfect world that we imagine from this world.  It puts a division of a kind
between them.  That is to say if you own a bakery you don't have to give all
your doughnuts to the poor, because if you do you'd go broke.  You give what you
can and what makes sense.  In the same way, we can't expect people to not be
racist, or territorial, or perfect in regard to others and really treat them as
if this is already the kingdom of love.  It just isn't.  So we try to do our
best.

Most importantly what I see as a new poetics (but really very old) is a humorous
recognition of the incongruous position we're in -- both living in a secular
world that is far from perfect and where as Christ said "the poor shall always
be with us," and yet able to imagine a perfect world.  The incongruity of these
two worlds seems to provide a perspective of humor and amazement.  I see this
most reflected, ironically, in the poetry and prose of the Sufis, and in their
jokes.  What it's doing there is something I keep meaning to investigate.

A very short definition of Lutheran two kingdoms is at:

http://www.elca.org/jle/articles/biblical_theological/article.biblical_theological.html

A brilliant exposition of two kingdoms as it is found in the work of Immanuel
Kant is at:

http://www.home.apu.edu/~CTRF/articles/1998_articles/wilms.html

At any rate, I probably screwed up those links, as I nearly always get one thing
wrong in them.  What I like about two kingdoms is that it teaches patience and
laughter, and a certain well, resignation.  All the avant-gardes of the early
20th century seem to me now too impatient to fix the world in one generation
whether it was Freud, or Marxists, or surrealists.  Everybody seemed to think
the answer was right there.  But I think that if you can really help your
neighbor in one small way once or twice a week, that's about all that can be
realistically done -- and then to not be too proud of it.  Even that much
requires a saint.

I still don't know what the role of poetry is in this, though, but thanks for
asking the question.  Charles Olson doesn't offer any transcendant principles,
it seems to me.  We somehow need to recover a few of those as a guiding star.
Do you think the Ten Commandments would be a beginning place, or would that just
be laughable to too many?

If anybody has examples of nonce-words either in the dictionary already or
else "live" I'd like to know what they are!

The Century Dictionary Online on "nonce-word": "A word coined and used only
for the nonce, or for the particular occasion. Nonce-words, suggested by the
context arising out of momentary caprice, are numerous in English. They are
usually indicated as such by the context. Some are admitted into this
dictionary for historical or literary reasons, but most of them require or
deserve no serious notice."

Thanks!

forever indebted!

Louis!

Without even have Gwyn's obligation to write a praise poem, I praise you.
Gabriel, for posting all these links. They make me absolutely hyper. I am
reaching for books. I am looking for one Sappho line that can hold me
together for a whole week without linking!  This is overwhelming. I got to
go back to school.
What it appears a young poet has to do these days!  What Gwyn calls a
"buttload" is minimally applicable to an elephant.

But(t), for real, thanks - tho I am not teaching these days, I bet I use a
little of this wealth.

This poor un-retiring minimalist,

Stephen V

saw your photo in the writers in the park anthology, (1986, sydney,
australia)

was that your first visit to australia?
i am studying the period for my phd and wondered if you had sounded your
work in similar venues in canada or the usa at that time.
this seems to have been a period when literature was being introduced to
public venues and general public audiences rather than
writerly/readerly/publishery festivals etc. and would be interested to
know what you thought of the writers in the park event and your experience
of the australian poetry scene.
i assume you had prior contact with australian poets, adamson, tranter etc
as i think i have seen some of your work in journals like poetry magazine
australia in the 70s.

Hey, did anybody else hear K. Silem (Kasey) Mohammad on the BBC, talking
about flarf? I almost flipped my cookies!

According to his blog Ron S. was interviewed too, so maybe I missed the
beginning.

housepress is please to announce the release of:

SAN'
by Lawrence Upton

24 pp, handbound.
75 numbered copies.
ISBN 1-894174-90-9
$7.00 including postage.

From the author's note:
"San' was the title of a one off book, produced by painting and =
collages, made as a present for Bob Cobbing on his 80th birthday, and =
presented to him in September 2000 at A day for Bob Cobbing. The idea =
was to really give something: I would no longer have it and did not =
expect it to be published. After Bob's death, Jennifer - Bob's widow - =
found the book among his possessions. At her suggestion, I borrowed it =
and used it as the starting point for a new set of images in Bob's =
memory. This is the new set of images. It retains a great deal of the =
original. "San'" represents the way "sound" was said in the street in =
the area in which I was brought up. This text, like the original given =
to Cobbing, is for utterance and movement."

About the author:
Lawrence Upton's directionless career terminated with four years as =
"Head of Academic Computing" at a Greater London college, from which he =
retired due to ill health in 1996. He has been making poetry for nearly =
four decades and is prolific in a variety of writing genres. He was a =
member of "jgjgjg" and other performance groups; and produced =
electro-acoustic pieces at West Square Studio. His collaboration and =
performance practice has persisted and developed, with many colleagues =
especially, latterly, the late Bob Cobbing. He co-edited the influential =
anthology Word Score Utterance Choreography in verbal and visual poetry =
(1998) with the late Bob Cobbing; and now he co-directs Writers Forum =
Workshops and Writers Forum, the publishing imprint.

The show must still be available somewhere out there. The BBC archives its
most recent radio shows. Which show was it on? I just browsed their poetry
shows to no avail..

I wanna know what flarf is too and I wanna know what K. Silem Mohammad
sounds like!

Good-- so someone on the list is thinking about this. I have spent allot of
time over the past few months reading Italian, Russian and French poetry
from the period 1906-1920 and it is very jarring comparing these poems to
what came later.  I have been frustrated in the current poetic conversation
here on this listserv that we are spending too much time trying to revive
old, tired ideas that are not relevant or are at least less relevant in
light of the world we are now in. I totally reject the idea that we need to
be in a 'holding pattern' Whitman, Eliot, Lorca, Alberti, Neruda, and many
others were harbingers
of the world that was created, not critics only. We need as poets to be
challenging 'facts' and 'movements'Hollywood, Fiction and music are not
going to do this because they are all co-opted by money and corporate
interests but perhaps with poetry
we can return to the center of discussions

the 21st century is already not the US's century but 9/11 is a moment of
change, the idea of American Empire is silly what we have is a global elite
empire made up of the same people in China the USA, Europe et cetera

We are all thinking about it, how could one not? There is not one answer or
one flavor of poetry we can all bandy about and show the world "poets mean
business now!" Alan is correct -- his style indicates his stance, as my
poetry indiactes my own standings as I am sure your poetry embodies your
understanding of the post Pax Americana. In 30 years a grad student will
look back on this time and say "Poet X" did this and said that and inspired
by ways of this. Write poetry Haas, this is all we can do today.

I've been pondering these lines of Duncan, from Ground Work, Before the War,
in light of 9/11:

men's Good              "as naive and incoherent"

as their Evil   "experienced and lucid"

Osama bin Laden may be considered good by certain Muslims and evil by us.
His dissemination of evil is experienced and lucid and at the same time his
thinking that it is good for Muslims is naive and incoherent. On the other
hand, our invasion of Iraq may be considered good by us and evil by them.
Our perpetration of this evil is experienced and lucid and at the same time
our thinking that it is good for the Iraqis is naive and incoherent.

Time is not divided up (Yeats). History is contemporaneous (Pound). Osama is
merely a pirate (see my previous post about Wahhabism). Wolfowitz admitted
it was all about oil. Let's put things into proportion (I'm not talking
about time, so I don't say 'perspective'). Retail terrorism vs. wholesale
terrorism(Chomsky).

We'll get thru this once Bush and Blair are seen as typical politicians,
LIARS. Pound finally admitted he was, and I quote, a "moron." He said it was
all about GREED. He pointed to the ground and said, "This is hell." Olson
referred to oil as that "silly sediment."

But then, it is the Crusaders and Zionists vs. the Muslims. I don't think my
rabid Catholic friend would care whether Bush lied. We have to protect
Israel, the Holy Land. So, we get back to Pound's, all history is
contemporaneous. We are having another Crusade.

(I don't agree with him at all.)

I can't stand living here in the U.S. any more. Like what Leonard Cohen sang
about America, "I love the country, but I can't stand the scene."

A couple of people asked whether my Flarf interview Saturday the 24th on BBC
World Service radio was or will be archived.  I don't know.  I sent an
e-mail to the person who originally contacted me, so maybe I'll hear
something soon.  Or maybe not.

Lest anyone build it up too much, the excerpts from the original 5 minutes
or so of conversation that finally made it onto the air basically consist of
me reading the last 4 or 5 lines of "Stupidity Owns Me" from COMBO 12, and
then explaining that Flarf is intentionally bad poetry that involves Google
search text results, and the interviewer saying, yes, but is it art, and me
saying, why yes, it is art, and her saying, prove it, then me saying
something about the collaborative process etc. etc.

The best part was the interviewer's Irish accent.  "Flarrruf."

Anatomy Of The Western World #0002

  Did spred so broad that heauens light did hide/Assure your selfe it
fell not all to ground/And eke the Graces seemed all to sing/At night
doth baite his steedes the Ocean waues emong/Vpon his foe a Dragon
horrible and stearne/Then of the certaine perill he stood in/And with
false shewes abuse his fantasy.

  And angry Ioue an hideous storme of raine/That nigh his manly hart did
melt away/Strangle her else she sure will strangle thee/And ouer all a
blacke stole she did throw/He stayde his hand and gan himselfe
aduise/With that misformed spright he backe returnd againe/Whiles sad
night ouer him her mãtle black doth spred/Yet kindling rage her selfe
she gathered round.

  What frayes ye that were wont to comfort me affrayd/And with new day
new worke at once begin/Long way he trauelled before he heard of
ought/That makes them doubt their wits be not their owne/Ye all
forwearied be for what so strong/From turning backe and forced her to
stay/Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore/Hymen iô hymen
dauncing all around/Hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst/When
weening to returne whence they did stray/Tho wrapping vp her wrethed
sterne arownd/And eke the Graces seemed all to sing.

  Did spred so broad that heauens light did hide/Ne let vaine feares
procure your needlesse smart/Fly to your faith for succour and sure
ayde/Be well aware quoth then that ladie milde/What frayes ye that were
wont to comfort me affrayd/That nigh his manly hart did melt away/Which
when the valiant elfe perceiu'd he lept/Sweet slõbring deaw the which to
sleepe them biddes/All cleane dismayd to see so vncouth sight/And dead
as liuing euer him ador'd/In siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed/And
fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes.

  Vntroubled night they say giues counsell best/And rushed forth hurling
her hideous taile/Then of the certaine perill he stood in/Yea but quoth
she the perill of this place/Yea but quoth she the perill of this
place/Or the blind God that doth me thus amate/God helpe the man so
wrapt in Errours endlesse traine/For whose defence he was to shed his
blood/They cannot finde that path which first was showne/A cloud of
combrous gnattes do him molest.

  Right faithfull true he was in deede and word/The one vpon his hardy
head him plast/Tho can she weepe to stirre vp gentle ruth/At length it
brought them to a hollow caue/That euery wight to shrowd it did
constrain/So liuely and so like in all mens sight/His gall did grate for
griefe and high disdaine/Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell/Or
wearied with bearing of her bag/Of needments at his backe thus as they
past/Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of shame/The stroke down frõ
her head vnto her shoulder glaunst/So slyding softly forth she turnd as
to her ease/And mightie causes wrought in heauen aboue.

  In secret anguish and vnpittied plaint/That soone to loose her wicked
bands did her constraine/That welnigh choked with the deadly
stinke/Whose double gates he findeth locked fast/The noblest mind the
best contentment has/They saw so rudely falling to the ground/When ruddy
Phoebus gins to welke in west/And mightie causes wrought in heauen
aboue/Be well aware quoth then that ladie milde/That from her body full
of filthie sin/He faire the knight saluted louting low/Strangle her else
she sure will strangle thee.

  The same so sore annoyed has the knight/Most lothsom filthie foule and
full of vile disdaine/Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright/In
siluer deaw his euer-drouping hed/In this great passion of vnwonted
lust/And all the world in their subiection held/Is wisely to aduise now
day is spent/A diuerse dreame out of his prison darke.

  Seemed in heart some hidden care she had/Tho wrapping vp her wrethed
sterne arownd/Threatning her angry sting him to dismay/He told of
Saintes and Popes and euermore/And low where dawning day doth neuer
peepe/And shall you well reward to shew the place/God helpe the man so
wrapt in Errours endlesse traine/Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more of
shame.

  That troublous dreame gan freshly tosse his braine/A-waite whereto
their seruice he applyes/With bowres and beds and ladies deare
delight/Her vomit full of bookes and papers was/Much can they prayse the
trees so straight and hy/Soone as that vncouth light vpon them
shone/Weening their wonted entrance to haue found/The warlike Beech the
Ash for nothing ill/Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright/Now when
that ydle dreame was to him brought.

  Downe in a dale hard by a forests side/Full iolly knight he seemd and
faire did sitt/As much disdayning to the curbe to yield/The forward
footing for an hidden shade/Of highest God the Lord of life and
light/Captiu'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares/A floud of poyson
horrible and blacke/And low where dawning day doth neuer peepe/And often
knockt his brest as one that did repent/He thought haue slaine her in
his fierce despight.

  Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought/But with his clownish
hands their tender wings/Sober he seemde and very sagely sad/And all
attonce her beastly body raizd/Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast/Ah
my deare Sonne quoth he how should alas/She was in life and euery
vertuous lore.

  And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas/He taught to imitate
that Lady trew/Eftsoones dismounted from his courser braue/And all
attonce her beastly body raizd/And angry Ioue an hideous storme of
raine/Most like that virgin true which for her knight him took/And she
her selfe of beautie soueraigne queene/Or wearied with bearing of her
bag/Yet kindling rage her selfe she gathered round/But wander too and
fro in wayes vnknowne.

  Suspect her truth yet since no' vntruth he knew/In this great passion
of vnwonted lust/Bidding his beades all day for his trespas/And said
faire knight borne vnder happy starre/Did spred so broad that heauens
light did hide/The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yuory/To Morpheus house
doth hastily repaire/Lo there before his face his Lady is/That wasteth
all this countrey farre and neare/And looked in his glistring armor
made/And more to lulle him in his slumber soft/He brusheth oft and oft
doth mar their murmurings.

  That which of them to take in diuerse doubt they been/Rest is their
feast and all things at their will/Much can they prayse the trees so
straight and hy/The messenger approching to him spake/Which swarming all
about his legs did crall/Long way he trauelled before he heard of
ought/That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond/His dwelling is by
which no liuing wight/Which swarming all about his legs did crall/A
diuerse dreame out of his prison darke/Then rudely he him thrust and
pusht with paine/A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine/Soone as
that vncouth light vpon them shone/And looked in his glistring armor
made.

  Huge heapes of mudd he leaues wherein there breed/Shall I accuse the
hidden cruell fate/A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine/Vpon his
shield the like was also scor'd/And ouerflow each plaine and lowly
dale/Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash prouoke/Then of the certaine
perill he stood in/That greatest Gloriana to him gaue/Or wearied with
bearing of her bag.

  To see th'vnkindly Impes of heauen accurst/Rest is their feast and all
things at their will/So liuely and so like in all mens sight/That euery
wight to shrowd it did constrain/He seekes out mighty charmes to trouble
sleepy mindes/Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes/Silly old
man that liues in hidden cell/The fruitfull oliue and the platane
round/In sort as he him schooled priuily/He making speedy way through
spersed ayre/Sweet slõbring deaw the which to sleepe them biddes/Tydings
of warre and worldly trouble tell.

  So sound he slept that nought mought him awake/Gathred themselues
about her body round/By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly/With that
misformed spright he backe returnd againe/The noblest mind the best
contentment has/In trauell to and froe a little wyde/He would not shend
but said Deare dame I rew/A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine/And
all attonce her beastly body raizd.

  The caruer holme the maple seeldom inward sound/Ne euer would to any
by-way bend/Sir knight with-hold till further triall made/That for my
sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew/The same so sore annoyed has the
knight/The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde/Her vomit full of
bookes and papers was/But when his later spring gins to auale/And
proou'd your strength on a strong enimie.

  A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed frõ her corse/May euer
passe but thorough great distresse/Thus ill bestedd and fearefull more
of shame/The cruell markes of many' a bloudy fielde/When weening to
returne whence they did stray/Of such as drunke her life the which them
nurst/Yea but quoth she the perill of this place.

  Pointed with mortall sting of her there bred/Die is my dew yet rew my
wretched state/Yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound/Assure your
selfe it fell not all to ground/As still are wont t'annoy the walled
towne/Hauing yrockt a sleepe his irkesome spright/The deare remembrance
of his dying Lord/Hauing all satisfide their bloudy thurst/Their
scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore/When weening to returne
whence they did stray/Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise.

  Wherein the hermite dewly wont to say/A little lowly Hermitage it
was/The caruer holme the maple seeldom inward sound/Then choosing out
few wordes most horrible/Vnder blake stole hyding her bayted hooke/Of
sundry shapes yet all ill fauored/Much grieu'd to thinke that gentle
Dame so light/Then with the sunne take sir your timely rest/With which
and other spelles like terrible.

  Had made a lady of that other spright/As still are wont t'annoy the
walled towne/The deare remembrance of his dying Lord/Vntill the
blustring storme is ouerblowne/Of straunge aduentures which abroad did
pas/And euer as he rode his hart did earne/Captiu'd to fortune and
frayle worldly feares/The day with cloudes was suddeine ouercast/That
for my sake vnknowne such griefe vnto you grew/And with new day new
worke at once begin/And by descent from Royall lynage came/And creeping
sought way in the weedy gras/And all the world in their subiection
held/And homebred euill ye desire to heare.

  To see th'vnkindly Impes of heauen accurst/Her huge long taile her den
all ouerspred/Markes which do byte their hasty supper best/He strowd an
aue-mary after and before/So pure and innocent as that same lambe/His
angry steede did chide his foming bitt/The one faire fram'd of burnisht
Yuory/That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare/And wakefull dogges
before them farre do lye/Cride out Now now Sir knight shew what ye
bee/Long way he trauelled before he heard of ought.

  Yet was in knots and many boughtes vpwound/Pointed with mortall sting
Of her there bred/The one of them he gaue a message too/His Lady sad to
see his sore constraint/Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde/He
thought haue slaine her in his fierce despight/Add faith vnto your force
and be not faint/And all the world in their subiection held/His gall did
grate for griefe and high disdaine.

A Momentary Loss of Belief in the Wisdom
of the Common People and a Curse on the
Bastards Who Own and Operate Them

"War is the continuation of policy by other means."
So said Von Clausewitz.

But war is also
The continuation of false consciousness
And falsified policy and politics
And greed masked as bourgeois generosity
By the falsified desires of American imperialism
By presidents wedded to cowboys and missiles
By chauvinist beer salesmen peddling the stars and stripes by
        the six-pack
By the trained psychopathic liars of the State Department
By simple-minded sods in all fifty states
By the born-simple clergy and suckers of religion
By the bearded dons and Ph.D. dumdums of Academia
By painters selling third-hand Da Da at fancy prices
By poets who have forgot their songs in their gilded cages
By farmers sold out and put on the road and still finding their enemy
        in Nicaragua or El Salvador
By workers given their walking papers for life and their heads still so
        unscrewed they think the enemy is Russia or Communism
By housewives pissing their pants and dreaming of Red Terror
Or hijackers invading Podunk

By other means.
Politics is the continuation of war by other means.

And now, you celebrated American jackasses:
You still want war?
Go let a hole in the head shed light on your darkling brain--
Remember Vietnam?

Go and be damned!
But don't count on me for nothing you righteous
        stupid sons of bitches!

>Born on May 21, 1926, Robert Creeley is a New Englander by birth and
>disposition although he has spent most of his life in other parts of the
>world, including Guatemala, British Columbia, France and Spain. In the
>1950s, at the invitation of Charles Olson, he edited The Black Mountain
>Review and taught at Black Mountain College, a crucial gathering place for
>alternative senses of writing at that time. Through the Black Mountain
>Review and his own critical writings, Creeley helped to define an emerging
>counter-tradition to the literary establishment-a postwar poetry
>originating with Pound, Williams, and Zukofsky and expanding through the
>lives and works of Olson, Robert Duncan, Allen Ginsberg, Denise Levertov,
>Edward Dorn, and others.  Subsequently, he taught at the University of New
>Mexico and in 1966 went to SUNY at Buffalo. Although most identified as a
>poet (For Love, Windows, Life & Death, and Just in Time are examples of
>his more than sixty books of poetry), he has written a significant body of
>prose including a novel, The Island, and a collection of stories, The Gold
>Diggers, as well as numerous essays. He is also known for the diversity of
>his collaborations with artists outside his own disciplines. Creeley was
>elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets in 1999 and served
>as New York State Laureate from 1989 to 1991. Among his other honors are
>the Frost Medal, two Guggenheim Fellowships, the Shelley Memorial Award,

SEMEZDIN MEHMEDINOVIC, ONE OF BOSNIA'S MOST PREEMINENT AUTHORS, READS =
FROM HIS NEW COLLECTION  NINE ALEXANDRIAS, AT THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB, =
SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 7,  4:00PM

Ammiel Alcalay, translator of NINE ALEXANDRIAS and author of MEMORIES OF =
OUR FUTURE and many other books, will also read.=20

Following his depiction of Bosnia under siege in the much celebrated =
Sarajevo Blues, Semezdin Mehmedinovic now explores the vast space of his =
new continent.

In this nightmarish and exhilarating odyssey, Mehmedinovic's political =
acuity is displayed everywhere but barely pronounced. In Washington =
D.C., his new home, the graphic and tactile affirmation of life amidst =
horror depicted so masterfully in Sarajevo Blues, turns into an eerie =
silence that permeates both the expanse of the land and the heart of the =
American empire.

"In this remarkable sleight of hand that never becomes generically =
'fictional,' Mehmedinovic's narrator holds to the pulse of the real by =
protecting us from what he has seen and known in another life. This is a =
very different kind of witness, one that has as much to reveal to the =
initiated as to the uninitiated, to those who don't." - Ammiel Alcalay, =
from the introduction to Nine Alexandrias

Mehmedinovic arrived in the U.S. as a political refugee in 1996. His =
articles, poems, and essays have been translated and published in =
leading European and American newspapers and magazines. Sarajevo Blues =
was translated into Slovenian and published by Nova revija in 1995. In =

hi,

I've got this friend see, and he wants to know how he would get a copy of
Jordan Davis' new book. YOu see, this friend doesn't have a credit card so
he would gladly pop some american dollars into a plain vanilla envelope if
someone could tell him where to send it to. oh, yeah this friend lives in
canada so the postage might be a bit more than normal or to Normal Ill.

Thanks,
Kevin for a "friend"

I hate to be one of those people who can't be bothered to read all
the way back to the beginning of the thread, but there it is.  If
there's someone who wants Borregaard's address he or she can back
channel me and I'll pass it along to you.  As several have
remembered, he gave his first reading in many years (30?) at Small
Press Traffic a few years back when we were celebrating the
re-release of the NEW AMERICAN POETRY anthology.

His legend was that he was the last "student" at Black Mountain
College--running away from home as a teenager, he arrived at BMC on
the very day they locked up the place and unable to believe this turn
of events, he sat on the doorstep piteously and everyone felt sorry
for him & taught him a few things before saying goodbye.

And as I recall Duncan wrote the script of his wedding ceremony.
His little book of "Sketches for thirteen sonnets" by "Gerard Boar"
elegantly printed by, hmmm, was it Clifford Burke? (or was it published
by Oyez?), shouldn't be too hard to find - in libraries if not via the
net.

.Turns out Borregaard and Spicer were part of the same circle of poets etc
for a period. I am just now readin this biography of Jack Spicer and saw a
photo of Borregaard... I am not nearly half ways thru the book so I have no
more news....

In those days he had a beard
and looks tall and lanky from the photo, or rather, tall and bony.

The best known ought to be "aroint," as in "Aroint thee, witch!," Macbeth,
and I think also in Lear. Found only in Shakespeare, and at least one more

Ebbe worked with Jack Boise on the house Jack was building in Bolinas for
himself and Joanne Kyger, to whom he was married. One day Jack, a bit drunk,
fell from a beam and died. I was away at the time and hadn't heard the news.
When I returned, I asked, "Has anyone seen Jack?" Faces turned pale. Bolinas
was pretty weird with ghosts at the time.

The Poetry Center at SF State has a videotape of Borregaard reading,
with Robin Blaser, I believe.  I saw it years ago, back when Laura
Moriarty was still the archivist there.  On the tape, if I remember
correctly, he announces he's leaving poetry to become a carpenter.
Or am I just hallucinating this memory?  I was watching a bunch of
tapes, including one of a young John Wieners, because Kevin was
writing an essay for the Poetry Center catalogue and I was wardrobe
consultant.  I would describe the poets' outfits to Kevin because he
was interested in putting that in his essay, and I know more about
outfits than Kevin does.

Hi Kasey: sorry I could not make it to your reading/book party Sunday eve.
You must have been punch drunk good after the marathon prep of readings the
previous several nights!
Deer in the Headlights - may your antlers (& the book, which I will get)
carry the day.
Lime Tree suggests postpartums is setting in. Go easy on yourself. It's been
one helluva a great poetry summer - and you have been a major part of it.

Time (almost) for a long evening look at Mars.

Later,

Stephen V

The interviewer said something about flarf being big in California and
now we're going to speak with--

I was pretty sure I was dreaming, so I said aloud "Kasey Mohammad." And
the interviewer agreed.

Gary Sullivan's name came up and I think the interviewer may have asked
for the number of official flarf poets. Something like that.

K has the most beautiful voice. Full of all the intensity and
intelligence you might expect.

Well, Bowering says he has never been to Peekskill. But he has time to
hang out in Missoula watching Little League games. Go figure. If it
weren't so bewildering it would be just plain sad. Maria and I are going
to have to live with that. We'll sit on our little tuffet of memories,
and occasionally we'll be joined by Pierre Joris.

Those of you who feel like you go to sleep and wake up with Bowering
might like to hear him talk about his dream of a big green bird. It's
about 23 minutes and 16 seconds in from the beginning of an interview on
the UCalgary site:

http://www.ucalgary.ca/%7Ecwh/archive/

Of course, when I brought this to his attention, he claimed he'd never
had a dream of a big green bird. So draw your own conclusions.

It was recently reviews in Publisher's Weekly -- starred review -- and I
also received this great blurb from Adelaide Morris:

PUBLISHER'S WEEKLY

Less a programmatic critical volume than an improvisatory, searching look at
a still-nascent form, Stefans's ruminations, exhortations, gags ("Th plug
may be puld any day on cultur; th poem must be prepared") and excitations
comprise a print take that is closest to the online world's free-wheeling
sense of formal inquiry, semi-disposable experimentation and ardently
utopian possibility. The eight longish pieces here are mostly concerned with
screen-based poetry, but are utterly different from one another. A
real-time, online interview with poet Darren Wershler-Henry (The Tapeworm
Foundry) kicks things off, covering everything from the Toronto Concrete
poetry scene to Situationism, Prynne, Eno, Hakim Bey, the launch party for
Cabinet magazine and Frampton Comes Alive. "Reflections on Cyberpoetry"
offers a tight series of straight-faced pronouncements ("`Mauberley is a
cyberpoem; The Cantos, not.") and insights into algorithmic composition;
"Stops and Rebels" unwinds into a dense, rewarding essay that manages to
proceed via footnotes without invoking banal postmodernist tropes; "Proverbs
of Hell" riffs Blake-wardly ("Condemn not Flash because it is `slick' "),
while "A Poem of Attitudes," a long, beautiful abecedarian work composed
with the aid of splicing programs, comes on like Bruce Nauman emptying out
his neon tool box: "Not a curse. Not all the songs,/ no gimmick. Not be. Not
in my poem./ Not like a room. Not mix the beans." Stefans's two major
cyberworks, "The Naif and the Bluebells" and "The Dreamlife of Letters," are
easily locatable online, as is his multi-author political blog, Circulars.
With more ideas per page than most poets put into entire books, Stefans
(Free Space Comix) provides a provisional, wickedly smart and goofily joyous
lay of a land that is still being discovered--and created from scratch.

GREAT BLURB FROM ADALAIDE MORRIS, editor of Sound States: Innovative Poetics
and Acoustical Technologies

In Fashionable Noise: On Digital Poetics, Brian Kim Stefans does for digital
poetry what Lev Manovich's Language of New Media does for contemporary media
art.  Starting from dynamics peculiar to the computer poem-its algorithms,
source files, and flows of digitized information-Stefans imagines the
computer poem from the bottom up.  Instead of aligning it with or against
conventional verse or avant-garde texts, he situates it in the larger field
of digital art and new media.  The book's major essay-construction-"Stops
and Rebels: a critique of hypertext"-is an annotated computer poem that
provides not only a canny mix of poetic and critical source files but a
lexicon of critical terms, a history of digital experiments, and a series of
brilliant meditations and riffs on new media creations.  The result is
essential reading for anyone interested in new media art and poetics. -- Dee
Morris

He also ran an art gallery for a while; and on his first trip to the

Haas,

It's also important to think through the bigger picture, or the theoretical
ramifications.  Would you rather have your life be considered as a sporting
event or as an aesthetic event?

Teachers & Writers Collaborative is happy to announce that members of the
Buffalo Poetics and Writenet lists can order copies of my book What Is
Poetry: Conversations with the American Avant-Garde, at a discount.
Instead of paying $17.95, you now can pay a simple $15.  All you have to
do is call 1-888-BOOKS-TW, and let them know that you're taking advantage
of the WRITENET-BUFFALO special offer.

WHAT IS POETRY contains a series of interviews with 12 poets (including
John Ashbery, Fanny Howe, Robert Creeley, and Bernadette Mayer) about
their work, accompanied by an introduction to the American "avant-garde
tradition," a series of biographies, and an extensive bibliography of
primary and secondary sources. I hope that the book will go over well not
just with poetry "aficionados" but with teachers and students of modern
American poetry looking for a way in to the work apart from the expected
critical essays.

best,
--daniel

As a teacher of mostly non-academic students with no
literature background I find the book incredibly
useful for precisely this: helping me to approach
teaching the students from mostly vo-tech backgrounds
somewhat difficult writers...and of course also
understanding as a teacher these are not difficult
writers at all! the ann lauterbach, fanny howe, and
harryette mullen chapters are real revelations!

Hello all,

I'm writing a cover piece for my local alternative
weekly, Folio Magazine, about the state of slam poetry
and its relationship (positive and negative) to other
poetry communities. I would love any comments on the
subject, including experiences anyone has had at
slams, feelings on the Def Poetry Jam, the state of
modern poetry in the context of television and other
media, and slams as they apply to the human tradition
of storytelling. All feedback will help to reinforce
my points and maintain balance. I assume that any
responses may be published by the magazine.

Thanks,
Flora

Yes.  I've assigned it to MFA students who are wary of the avant-garde.
It's a great intro.  Very helpful.

Subject: Discount on WHAT IS POETRY: CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN
AVANT-GARDE


Teachers & Writers Collaborative is happy to announce that members of the
Buffalo Poetics and Writenet lists can order copies of my book What Is
Poetry: Conversations with the American Avant-Garde, at a discount=2E
Instead of paying $17=2E95, you now can pay a simple $15=2E  All you have =
to
do is call 1-888-BOOKS-TW, and let them know that you're taking advantage
of the WRITENET-BUFFALO special offer=2E

WHAT IS POETRY contains a series of interviews with 12 poets (including
John Ashbery, Fanny Howe, Robert Creeley, and Bernadette Mayer) about
their work, accompanied by an introduction to the American "avant-garde
tradition," a series of biographies, and an extensive bibliography of
primary and secondary sources=2E I hope that the book will go over well no=
t
just with poetry "aficionados" but with teachers and students of modern
American poetry looking for a way in to the work apart from the expected
critical essays=2E

best,
--daniel

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

in this poem i am placing one word after another
i am thinking how these words go together
the maroon sound of them in any weather
caught in the throat of clever socialness
then that line and this weren't any good
so backtrack and that's such a bother
that i haven't any executables today or any other
this stanza has good socialness but would rather
have a machine bit here and there so as to dither
among father prose and mother poem and brother
or sister that just about rounds out familiar author
technique just an oops and backtrack and then gather
what's left an execrable lather
and then backtrack and backtrack

thinking just what combination of letters would work
i'd rather listen to or be a circle jerk
or at the very least a jerk
that might lurk and carry dirk in all this murk

how else to destroy each and every poet
without a some codework we would hardly know it
unless one were left alive to tell it
if a cat's got rhyme this time then we should bell it

"fantasticate|ruggedize" - Natalie Simpson

any word, errant, searching for a syllable leads to
some link. we scorn into set rhythms, redundant,
redux. we slotted the sun, you imply, in transit.

we reason pain is well above a moment's flicker.
the room could collide into itself, walls move
imperceptably, as hummingbirds. all that flutter.

In "fantasticate|ruggedize", Natalie Simpson dares to crack open our set
rhythms through her daring sentences. "at all costs, the simplest line nets
all fluster." Indeed.

Natalie Simpson has had work published in several chapbooks (privately
printed and thru housepress) and in the journals Queen Street Quarterly,
West Coast Line, (orange), filling Station and dANDelion. She was also a
member of Calgary's PHU collective participating in readings, performances
and a webpage of radical poetics. After several years involvement with
filling Station, she is currently Managing Editor and is helping bring a new
look and new focus to the magazine's pages. She has recently completed a
manuscript which is looking for a home.

Published on a long sheet of 5.5x17 pale blue paper folded brochurewise w/
punk rock cover. Email ryan fitzpatrick (rcfmod@hotmail.com) if you're
interested in getting a copy.

IBN MASARRA

and that they sent thither [Afghanistan] with that object, to form a Masonic
lodge of the Even Guys (anti-Odd Fellows),
the philosopher Ibn Masarra (883-931)

this Ibn Masarra (Osama ibn Laden) was a pantheist (pant(h)e(o)r(ror)ist) of
Cordova
who had made an especial study of translations of certain Greek books
attributed to the Arabs to Empedocles

Philosophy had penetrated Spain (haven of Mohammed Atta) under Mohammed, the
fifth Omayyad Sultan
but philosophy was held there in disrepute, and intolerance was much more
rife there than in Asia

The Andalusian theologians, indeed, who had journeyed to the East, spoke
with devout horror of the tolerance of the 'Abbasids, and especially of
those meetings of the learned of all religions and sects, where metaphysical
questions (such as Russian telemetry) were discussed without regard to
revelation, and where even Moslems (odd Christians) sometimes turned the
Koran into ridicule (Journ. asiat., Ve serie, t. ii. p. 93; Chwolsohn, ii.
622).

Freethinkers (anti-slavewits) were therefore obliged to conceal their views
(at Langley especially), and naturally found the constraint irksome

[...] he seems to have joined the secret society of the Isma'ilites
(believers of Where your mind goes, your body goes and the Deity of
Multi-Location)

We are led to believe this by his conduct after his return to Spain, for
instead of flaunting his opinions, as he had done in his youth, he concealed
them, and made great parade (en robe de parade) of piety and austerity

[he] ma[d]e a stalkinghorse of orthodoxy

he deceived the vulgar and [...] attracted many pupils [...] leading them
step by step from

faith faith faith faith faith faith faith faith faith
faith faith faith faith faith faith faith faith faith

to doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt
doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt
doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt to

DISBELIEF

He did not, however, succeed in duping the clergy (CIA), who, [...] burned
[...] his books

Dear Kominos, I have no idea if this letter of yours was addressed to me,
David Bromige. No, I have never been in Australia. But  I have appeared in
various literary magazines published there. I was a canasian poet in the
late 50s and early 60s, and maintain links wirh friends/fellow poets there,
but psblish primarily in the usa. I regret knowing nothing of the "writers
in the park."  If I have responded inaccurately, please accept my apoiogy.
Bedt wishes, David Bromige.

Like honey grained, soft and spread,
Across oceanic broad-backed edge,
The sand cakes on each break-ward motion,
Every shovel’s arching staff, and
Every form, frosty-thick, stays
Hung fast, steady-clumped within the spray.

Ever now the umbra settles forth and lacks recess.
Planted firm into hidden penny loafers,
Pressed in full, shouldered up, kind by kind,
Our leaning physus as a sea of flesh;
Our waning shade lies severed loose and seethes;
Our lowing knees, sunk down, down, down,
Dark deep, stuck into the suckling beach.

We’ve kept these lines beyond our eyes.
We move our skin across each break.
The sounds of dusk are thickened over,
Tucked light beneath old lingering sights of day.
There is no more yellow rub upon the window pane;
Mid-stroke curses, bellied forth, cast out in vain
Against the vestigial noon of surly present suns, antipodal, drained.
The horizon never wanes, from such resorts resigned on bays,
Yet we haul and wait, and haul and wait, and lean again:
The tide rolls in, low and slow upon its wide and aching back.

Weaving out soaked wool in dye, stretching along,
Limbs bend as salty corpora, bathed in crepuscular light.
Though not pallid dangling, our palms twist wrenched like stone, hard and white,
Weathered pearls upon working shafts: rusted spades skewer through
By scooping wave on wave, and shot-for-shot
We give rise to many works, and we shiver till relief.
A death upon us, one less, two more,
        upon our coldest, crowding shore.

Whitman wrote out contradiction as beauty, but these scuttling men on the modern
stage play beauty as a bitch, and mistake her fiery bush for thinning bale.

The same men think that thought is tooled fantasy and clay.  They wrench it
round with bloody hands – with tears upon their cheeks.  But it is numbed and
tender flesh they pinch and print, lies between their palms, and bended tales
upon the pore.  Everything is hidden in this clay, and in the why it is not
clay, not classed, but mutable and ignoring our defamations, a rather simple
sacrament, and of our stapled flesh.

. . . If men only knew they were men! . . .
. . . left unrenewed and snuffed amongst the frosty snows of wintery swells, may
our maligned be soft embalmed and but some ember spent . . . the swells recede .
. . granting to all a lowly loft: a shift incarnate as a blade of grass or grain
. . .

It is very much a seductive romance to be vague, with the heart, with the mind.
 So as to be able to speed cross airy sentiments as in quick pursuit, so as to
unbridle the passionate tropes and indulge the weighty words in their massive
pull, loosed into such hopeful places so thought as to naturally live and dwell.
 But can the lusty sphere find native fit in the spaces of a cube?

There is time enough (an essential time indeed!) to hold these weighty motions
still, to palm and grip upon these shapes, to tend each surface as a subtle
field, with the careful fingertips of the tempered intellect.

There is no mystic adze to plain the curves, nor blessed chisel with which to
round the edges soft.  For once the hands, the hearts, the minds, and all the
will, have left the settled scene (or so they lightly think) and have moved so
eager on to turn another phrase, there are those who come soon after, finding
strewn and heavy angles, bent old pipes and ball bearings, mangled symmetry in a
place where grass once grew, forgotten by an absent heart which once beat out
its wretched, barren place.

The face of the world has grown oh so pleasant, has been made into softer,
sweeter flesh, touched up and blushed, a cadmium mediate of rouge, applied thick
like a heavy rose mud, painted on by those ever lighter tendrils of stainless
steel and silicon speed.  Beneath the whisper of static is the lost experience
of immediacy.  The world still spins at the same relative speed, flowers bloom
and crumble into dust, the gentle moon pulls up on the tides, lust upon lust
goes into the eyes of lover’s exchange, hash bars are frequented and drinks
imbibed, corruption has not ceased, motivations churn for power, all things will
go on in a romantically biblical parabola until the end of our bumbling days,
and it is all a gloss so very soon.  But beneath the whisper . . . ::

The variable x (fill it in with whatever pleases: love, war, peace, sexuality,
fraternity, family values) appears to us as lifeless and ephemeral, it is
indistinguishable from the fictions it finds itself couched within, it appears
as just another jig within a jigsaw of jigs.  The satellites transform live
writhing  corpses into an immaterial function, beam them from the sandy earth
into  the environ, and then what very little that remains indiscriminately a
fiscal translation of any x into to a corporate hub, they are sent with the
avarice of desired attentions, and finally into the end game of tubeless flat
screens plopped across the humming lateral planes. Each set  replete with
picture-in-picture: Baghdad in flames enveloping Ozzy Osbourne drinking Jim Beam
on dead Iraqi civilians cornered into  Kim Basinger’s hourglass figure
backgrounding the satin of Ari Fleishcher’s immovable bust kissing the sands of
Panama Beach where Saddam Hussein drinks a martini with Kim Jong Ill segueing a
coming soon to must see prime time a new reality tee-vee: Guantanamo Bay
Inquisitions by Guy Guy Guy and his Gap brand brown shirts and the sideshow
dancing Texas twins.

On the war between science (pop) and art (pop), the two cultures:  Philip K.
Dick has been beaten down and back to the anachronistic hills by Andy Warhol’s
ever more marketable and ever more nascent prismatic broomstick.  Star Wars
(either one) was a future outmoded by the strongmen of  market-stats and
techno-foundries before it could even begin manifesting itself as the physically
present.  It was a far-fetched subjunctive subsumed within a grander gala of
billboards and ticker tape, and what we have done is something much more than
light speed or spying down at St. Petersburg’s KGB shoelaces from the crows-nest
on the moon.  S. Dali would send himself into a crying shame beneath such
unapproachably whirring lights.   Only drive by Gary, Indiana and watch the
fire-stacks shoot straight columns of orange flame ripping into a crepuscular
sky, and maybe you will know then that things have become irrevocably strange.
But only if you are silent, only if you forget that it is all a matter of
straight faced normality, and forget that it all follows as a matter of fact
from the Industrial Revolution, only if you are a ghost and empty to your own
life as a networked node, a defamiliarized shell of simple facticity.

As a silence, it is so very strange, all the makeup just flakes away like dusty
and demineralized mica cakes, and there again it can be seen that there does
exist a violence and love somewhere of pumping hearts, crushing bones, day
dreams, snuffed consciousness, shortened breath, and that analog lives do in
fact unfold in organic pulses beneath the whisper of static: immediate
experience, liberated flesh, etc.

Such is the
pop-culture-full-access-live-coverage-embedded-forever-hyphenated-life-fractal-Vaudeville-Children
of Paradise-neologistic-meta-severed-New American Century mess.  This is no
elegant rouge to be sure, nothing possibly as clean as that.  We as a majority
have become madly in love with our pell-mell imagist schismatics which are
naively taken for the democratically uncarved block – as if we knew what the
hell is going on or what we are actually doing – and we are simple and
side-blind to this tattered appliqué.  And so if it appears to us to be pretty
and quick, we are correct in a sense, for we what see we see and we feel what we
feel, and what we see and feel is pretty and quick, but these are all
half-truths and mean something more:  it appears to be pretty and quick but only
because we have stopped looking.  If you look with silence and with care what
you will feel and see will be sloppy as hell, and the world will no longer be
yours.

To begin compassion one must live honestly.  Which is said by our love to be
truthfulness of logic and morality.  And to define all these for our paramour?
Suddenly a disastrous turn: it fell apart and they didn’t say so but just mucked
on.  In so many days of such-and-such bric-a-brac, then a ‘dark tea-time of the
soul’, but pangs entered in and hind out fast into the light, upon the wild
rocks.  Was it infidelity?

Overhead halogen, sterility and faceless foreheads in first appearance bobbed
like buttery splotches; after many years I learned finally to make shapes:
amphibians of a type you like, and outlines, in ponds of realist machinations,
where frogs are frogs as named without consent. All these things you and I
imagine, and out they come tumbling in pairs, oil-slicked like so many ducks in
a row.  We trade these fowl and drink the oil, like so many licks and a hearty
blow.

Muck-muck-muck into the thick of it, until you darken and counsel the storm,
perforate its underbelly with crowned perfidy, it will leak its own ignorance
like the goo of questions commencing.  Glop-glop-glop, it is certainly an
injustice, which only raises the newer question; but no man lives but like that
burdened rolling horse, on its back like a slow churning gut, ankles strung up
only loose enough by the rolling, vaulted  skies, while its sinews punch
sharpened hoofs thru the deflating nimbus, meekly now commanding the
heart-strings to pluck themselves.
6.

Your ankles, St. Francis, may alarm and save thus the quiet woodland life,
Strung jingling tongues that a modest habit and earth brown bells belie.
Though angels, St. Francis, touch the grass by weightless wing’s descent,
Needless of compassion’s cleaving ways for deathless work’s intent.

Your angels, St. Francis, gaze not for stuffy flesh nor decays of living rust,
For death and dying to deathless light means a light unleashed into wayless flux.
Though ankles, St. Francis, may peddle forth with warning notes strung and bowed,
In want of vain attempts at kindly steps you crush down on those not so well
endowed.

7.

“John Locke is dead,” so says he who holds that paper out, stuck in the face of
bewilderment.  It is certainly silly what young romance will do, the walls it
erects, with brick and mortar, while the mind says, “John Locke is dead,” and
thinking away, “The walls are ever removed.  I’m sick of this reuse, this failed
coup.”  But you stand a young boy, the bed-sheets still wet.  Locke is not dead,
fool, only your desire to be understood.

8.

The act of writing as a practice of confiding the truth, the contract of
impressions, with source of power from the subject; this all has left our
method.  From where do our words spring?  And why do we say “our” view when not
one can say “my view”?

The sides of skin: on one, our organs, on the other, air and all the rest.  On
which side do our minds (p)reside?  The way it is written cannot cover this, we
are far beyond the positive, and left with merely sticks and curves.  Shaken on,
tossed about, hands all gripped with similar grips, each haul up to Jehovah but
no rain can appear.

“This fine system was
Founded in the forests.”
It was then taken out
Into the plains of
Smaller islands,
Squeezed beneath the palms,
And rendered unto a
Newer pleaser, pleased
By & by as long as it
Keeps on comin’,
Growing past the hands.

Now.  We the forests thought
These grims to be
So delicate, . . .
So right we were;
Back to the handsaw
And the hawk,
Or is it a handsaw
Or a dove?

10.

Euclid, your back must ache – bent for so long in that compromising position,
cold ass on rock, hands weaving spells hung over your knees, while the vultures
circle overhead, unnoticed by your exacting eyes and digits, caring only for
that which never dies.  But you, Oh Euclid, will surely die!  And that imperfect
bird will have its way when your imperfect flesh meets imperfect day.

11.

There becomes a markéd increase in the emptied medley of ways – we go without
the muddied print; in this we go on quiet mud – and further more, we sit – some
habit: silent nod, a verbal shrew.

But our mood is filléd mug, while death goes unrenewed – this weight, not much,
though arching backs like hoofs above the field – our losses scattered among the
memory’s lapse, our dispossesions, waded thin, concealed.

12.

As if I’ve not moved, there’s never been any ‘there there’, thus I do not have
and: no answer can be given with surety, even if one acts as if.  And speaking
is our mostly filléd mug.  Cement cannot expand but to crack.  And like eggs we
is, wobbled while we white and rot.  But this is smiles in the dark for losses
in the light, which we forfeit for sleep, across the white-washed, somniferous noon.

We are men, however, and cannot remove the day, which is hourless, and not a
tack of time.  We coma or dream or wake or unborn or do not know.  There will
always be a second: a second moving; a second stopped . . . as long as speaking
is not unsaid.  Until attached to space our minds remove and return no more to time.

13.

I’m laid longways at the loom, my hands at work, weaving wool without command,
without intent, though the weaving is chosen by my being laid, by the loom, by
my side, by the wool and weavings extending outward crossed the day, and forget
this not, for my eyes are open, and cannot blink out the sight of busy hands,
weaving, working, spreading . . .

I’m laid longways at the loom.  Wool upon my lids, weaving by my busy hands,
fabrics shoot crossed the day, the day is woven wool by virtue of the loom and
busy hands at work and learning quickness . . .

14.

Been researching A.N. found the variance is spiraling, lines diverging like
angered crows self-disgusting into severed clouds.  Like canyon walls, grinned
and sunned into the dry crackled.  Nakedness bends the light, we shake the demon
breaker, firing clays of disruption, the light will bend in variance, with
canyon walls.  We smile, grinned.  The dry crackle is researched, A.N.
self-disgusting, sunned, spiraling into firing nakedness.  The hands of a demon
breaker spin; researched  of variance, we smile, grinned.

15.

The liars would never let it happen.  Not flower beds like bone piles from up
into the wind.  It is grinding bells, pollinate my phoneme.  Our chins are
scraped below, from where we stand; what falls, what piles.  Severings are not
complete, what creates.  Something of a stoppage.  Tripping up, Atlas gave
birth, all God-men rolling in soft dirt faces of the greeny grassed breasts of
hell.  Feels good and caged.  Not the liars would let it happen, never let it,
nothing smiled, and died again on its merry raining little way and laugh laugh
laugh it was.

Libre steals time, recline, recline.  Has this?  Has this?  Pointing is an
endless motion.  Like worms and such.  Better way to die forth in accompaniment
of vertical & horizontal actions, pointing, levering, passivity.  Has this

 Tumbled and a man swings ropes from objects responsive, but only my footage is

Between the furies of agreement, the world shuts then as eyes, and not one will
shake with resistance.  Pygmalion has entered in, has said and spoken, we follow
through with remechanized  dance, and all we shaken, obfuscated.  Lightly
careful, eggshells in the wind, but into the dirt, the sun follow may lead,
loons are still, and man is maple walking, then into the dirt and lightly careful.

It is from the graveled hills, these movements, floating dearly below, as
grounding, as bi-polar methamphetamines, drowling the hours, slipping them
nicely out amongst the uniform fogs.  We’ve  kept

                treasures, cornered in dust.
Mystical knocks on the walls, small hands

                pressed into the wooden shadow,
                it was known, forgotten
                and still
                it was known; we’ve been
walking now,

                                for days, it is difference,
                not likeness,
                        rolling and melding the
earth.

I would connect these things in my
mind, I’d let them is,
        then I’d

We’d connect these
        things
        in
Our world
        between us; then we’d

not even white our eyes
to look closer still
        up against
        it.  This is government.

Cross-referenced com-noded.  another please?

There is a blackness tabled in the crannies of foundation, broken Latin (hecro
tabla rosa) on the mind.  Our choreographed prayers are spun into quartz,
(golden clocks) and followed through – and bent – into mass and pull, a day, a
god; this has not become a clearing. The Lord has yet to be seen, and the hands
revolve counter to the spherical suns, sliding in rolls of vision, palmed into
zeroed skins.

Felines met on path, circled in fiendish theatrics, and proceeded to play.
Lion, Tiger, and games with naked snarls, darted to the shadows, hinted &
pointing.  Not possible could it end in boredom  . . . it says yes and new and
heat in the mix. – Later fades away.

Accidental notations a raising ‘pon the wood.  Swiftless crossings, dropped in,
rolled in airy pockets, boiled . . . into the spaces was drawn the thing which
wonders.  The exits placed in stopping, cooling, a letting of ocular blood,
drained into the earthy soils.

A cast away and sleeping,
these projects recede, and
the seemings move acrostic.

Eaten by the sun, followed
by a word, circled and
periodic, our place of
birth, time beneath
a lunar shadow; these
are coupled with want
and names, what is
called brings forth
then a death of change.

Always found us working at the gate . . . Gate, Gate; beyond, beyond.  From the
sun, upon the origination of light’s pointless feet, I down my eyes upon the
body’s formation, it sleeps within the motion . . . light retreats as steps
complete.  Is skin upon a man as dirt upon the earth?  Have pores become
volcanic in the touching actioned out of mind?  So begat the questions unto man,
the light proceeds, and we have yet to learn our flesh.

Prior to the meeting our mugs, side by side, left beading sweat, rings upon the
table round, stools unsat and dusted air.  Prior to our meeting, our first, we
sat and drank and maybe in all, in all, in all the heavens and hells they cried,
for they knew the sin to come, knowing these places are placed and waiting for
return.  Our tears do bead, our lives do meet, over and over in dusty light,
forget and sleep.

The streets remain walked and crossed.  In this way I come to see another you
unfolding, what that?  what past?  Not to be held, nor let, nor left, and now to
seed another; while soil drained of mass, what grows will be the greenery of
mirrors – a livened copy of the joined.  Do not ask why I ask, but why did your
falling come so clean?

Moving back, to the street.  Ushered across by knowing, streamed into the
question, and my answer was you, moved and moved into lovely knowing that I
could now, finally, see up tall to your eyes, like alien greys, marbled in sleep,

say,
“okay,” and we’ll
find ourselves back into

the pathway we’ve
made (now to be cordially

dead) I feel each
corpse; I

love you.

past and rambling neurons,

We cannot uncage, it

Each opened, page on page, loosed upon the light; drowned and dappled sun in

Say and say, we’ve chanted and lost – meine weltanschuaang ist nicht; ist nicht;

space defines the brick-brick-brick.

From across (this is not) the canyon wall we launch (this is not) our way.  It
seems painted, seems to say.  Old colors, crackled in rust and death; new
colors, dripped in waters and seed: all is spread out . . . (this is not . . .
again/again beyond/beyond).  Can say we else but laugh at the Joker’s wish?

First years (three nicks and triple pens) as light and lost as metal print loose
in pockets nearly spent against the weights I’ve never known . . . but looked

Currency, no longer placed, but like butter timed without a ticking bread, laid
upon the table long and deep . . . I sit silent, bruising happened knees, to

Children of the Mother -Father,
Born from the neither & naught,
We are those who are uninitiated,
Offspring of the Demiurge.

Tho all in this rests in wild untruth;
For we were not born,
Death has already been;
We are not
Moving.

There exist no remains.

Children of the Mater-Pater,
We are those who remain uninitiated,
Though asleep in unawares,

Unyellow the breath which rubs in separate air.

By letters’ fruitless movement, we’ve looked, I’ve looked.  Newness has not
sprung forth, it lies vacant and crumbling, above us, threatening.  Notice not
these things, running as undercurrents, they are much to simple, men who know
have filed them into mystical cabinets, dirty and rancid.  Shinier objects lay
about, to be held up and possessed, and soon we’ll have more.

But do not forget the change in seasons, forgetting the circles will leave one
full and immobile.

I’ve like to rephrase, but find myself looped in this, looking to unphrase.
Things could not be simpler, drawn out, calculated with lines and points,
colors, steps, but this map, it will break your legs.  Your wheelchair will
squeak for years, and then will quickly disassemble itself in the manner of
falling apart.  It will be metal entanglements restricting movement for lives to
come.  We cannot escape from chains, that is a myth, and we find ourselves
looped, in this, the phrase worms and worms until we are lost in the simple spin
of the maps of paths the worming took.

in many boxes are
forgotten as the fire

Building clay poems and firing them and tossing them up into shattered pieces

Effects deeply is the non – but each step, inverts/exverts, shoots thru and up
into icy verbal walls.  The lake will calm return.  No cloud counting for the
other, birds w/ each particle between, blocked by need, which occurs in shifts
and loss of intent – sun implies vanishing netherworlds agreed in solemn dirge
with wine and such, while walking men ceased into the shore washing limbs of
unbodily chronicity.

Small worlds cannot collide.  Collisions occur unnoticed with slight renowned,

After much speaking, meandering thru the suffocating air of fleeting smoke, not
quite unlike our speech, it comes upon us, the deadened weights of night; and
we’ll see the spheres laugh like rain across the hour so soon forgotten, the
lopped ears and severed tongues; much more sense in viscous  silence; putties
for the cracks in golden clocks, forcing the banter of confusion from its human

We could not receive the calm.  In this day it was beyond our color washed
faculties.  Was it the weeping in our rage a stress within reserves?  As the
moon circles the earth, walls dam the boiling waters bend to break . . .tears
then escape into placid currents, calm when none is held in places wept along
with moans and torrid movement.

This brilliantly empty holograph is mapped and mapping, platinum and complete –
Here and there, balanced all – push and pull, the same, the same – held in
motion soft and dreaming, disintentions  ring the bell in hand, tho the hammer
gone, its rhythm sings a constant, silent hum and drum in ivory grains of
sanding wave, as a single note, a vital tear.  We are the smile and rage of
Shiva’s mindless dance.

It’s said, “the centre cannot hold”
it becomes unfolding before the fold
there is nothing here
between this life betwixt with death
there is nothing here
which we do not know

And so before the night began
by dropping heavy stars upon my brow
Before my birth, before our God and
his breathy word, before the end and
after on, I knew it all, and let
it rest, in keyless vaults where men
do not destroy.

61.

I was lying.  Each word a color, transferring pigments and tone into individual
code.  Cipher, cipher, and be such liars; cipher, cipher, the words we speak be
dire.  Turning the corner we have piles of leaves shooting about in a fury of
gold and yellow brushed quickly up into vision’s path.  What is this?  And that?
 Many spinning things they are, pretending permanence with edges hard.

62.

Pell-mell bone piles slipping out of lips like water.  But wine is what is
sought while sober and death is looked about during life.  And opinion only
this: a way of life for dying.

63.  Address to The Pre-posthumous Peoples

Faster, now.  It is not, but for many, is
illusions.  So at the falling apart of non-
existence, as it speeds, fear will tear
at the shedding skins.  Holding near
with want.      Cannot be helped, but
the nothing in your way.

My flavor extends itself, but to what extent?  To whom?  And what will they know
of the tongue?  None of the wines ferment the drunken steps of man, they stumble
against the water’s edge and wade the days to a drowning end.

So you think and live
in dishonesty to get
to love?  Wrong path;
death awaits.

Overly miseretic copulations,
derive sustenance through
entrainment.  Back logged
and rolodexed into a

This is not referencable.
Reduced cubicles become

Entered with a broken sense of romantic joys.  As if being strangled by each
emotion in turned.  Constricted by the past movements represented now by these
neon vestiges.  Dug into the ground; placed by skinless hands into the motions.
 Things imbibed, curled presence, dying in the bops.  Entered with broken joys,
becomes fixation of false axioms, on the cross of today, facing canyon walls, I
refrain from further echoes.

After this day, long & undivided, a reversal of value, back upon the words
loosed and lost, the mass forgoes memory’s law, while maligning tendrils
distribute a newness of contradiction in the guise  of dissonant parcel.  The
all is part and parcel’s part is grained in fibrous touch.

To, now, structure / meter / scan upon the page, while my lips in earless air do
part, is but a simple switch and flick of the doers doner’s dying.

The reversal speaks the speech of change, the vestigial past is then the seeds
of mind . . . fruition  comes and no is now a flowering yes . . .but the mid-day
approaches soon – flowers close and contemplate the connections bridging time.

Tell me:

What I wish to mean I cannot say, an empty statement, keeping all freedom at
bay.  Furthermore, I do not wish to say; furthermore, I do not wish to mean;
furthermore I do not wish to wish nor speak from the first person, which obliges
authorship in place, and gets men dead.  Heads upon the platter shine equal to
both sides . . . dead matter – energetic structures – man working on corporeal
crust – useless motions and spending.  Upon this platter each head is
prehumously placed to shine with deadened equality.

The grey dust has been floating and latent and present since our eyes have
opened unto the rising sun.  It has settled now among the bones and shows us the
line, but still we examine, and our relative points spread across the spectrum
of delusion.  The stillness is no mask.

Fingers, listen!  Loose your grip
On this empty mug upon the bar.
From strain and sip, your blood, it drips
And pools among the line
Of echoed cheers and dusty seats.

And forever will be dry.

By empty casings, bones set loose
From lips, with the meaning marrow
drained and lost, gone within,
resound without.

79.

Advantages and disadvantages of doing nothing become listed and re-listed in the
cryptic messages of someone split and shaken down by words.  Taken down and
beaten by a man holding, in his left a sickle, in his right a tongue.  Where are
we going?  More lists and splits to the end of our days (each day a list and
split from the day before and the day to come).  Then we are done.

So may we join what is truly joined?

80.

Something sits within and spins, but not the soul (which I do not know); not the
mind (a mirroring shattered

with every bone loosed from lip a violence cracks and whips a spot upon the
earth below

Liars, you do not lie;
Tellers of truth, truth is faux.

81.

I’ve given up on
graffiti.  On the wall is in
place a nameless form,
planting all of our rules
into themselves, a redundant
seed, and there is
no interest in fact.

You said it best,
and our tongues
hung low during
the mushroom cloud
crucifixion.

82.

The switch is a carrot,
until you eat it.  Then
the eating is dying,
and the death is
some lively nourishment.
But carrots have strings,
and memory, memes,
and habit fucked a
knot out of nothing.
The magic is here,
but limp, limp, limp.
83.

I held that bitches arm, and
very tightly, for I was
scared she would vanish from
memory, and I think that
she will, very soon.  The
river to the west implanted
fear with its reddening
waters, and the flies
knew; the were coming
in swarms, engulfing
the air with the
sound that will keep the
streets clear of easy smiles
for years.  We were all
dead or dying, she knew this;
and the flies attacked her feast.

84.

bus stop at night where
time is stretched tightly
between your eyes and
that corner and nothing
seems to move until
that time is loose again
been waiting long
late for work
the bus does not care
so I stand and

look at the wetness shining
up and down the long street
few cars
little movement and much
space between the gaslights
between the movements and
sounds

85.

I started, rapidly, to breath this new, strange air, it gave me silence and
living dreams.  Before the facts, I knew certain things, like numbers and lists
and thoughts from other men.  This lasted for two weeks, it cracked my teeth,
and told me stories.  I met a being, slightly female, whispered that of planets,
and evolution.  We would grow, said she, into the kind of her, and breath this
gas complete.  I ignored her, and met the devil on the closet floor.  I made
some money with my gambling gift as I pulled air so deep, but death rumbled its
quick, quick coming . . . I closed the valve and went to sleep.

86.

The searching seems to find us more than the same.  Tho we cannot know.  And
seem to find distance as a closer friend than thee.  Racked our brains it finds
a way to move in hope.  Tho we cannot know, and seem to find only naught in what
we think is seen.

“A clear break,” we found our thoughts thinking, for it was a day, and [ . . .]
we drink that afternoon wine

and still now, as the clocks
are growing endless hands, we
drink that
bitter wine, silent round a
shattered jug.

87.

We sat upon that stony edge
and found a swirling yellow-backed
shell.  It lacked the movements
of sightly life, though it let off
its pattern – the inner-heated
spin of growth

88.

Be done with you:
an empty mug upon the bar.
Sit among the line
of echoed cheers and dusty seats
as your sweat runs dry.
Now here I have the handle
slipping not within my hand
but useless is this truth
the glass I see
is made of tempered sand.

89.

It was hung like this at birth: simply, upside down.  Turned and twined against
an inverness image of the cross, we all began our ambient journey thru the
golden cold desert of ideas, at the very same moment.  All the while entwined.
Now and now the threading path has woven across length and breadth of this
fabric’s colored face.  Permanent and unceasing in this simple march towards the
fire, where children do not play, he holds a knife beneath his cloak, and wears
a smile on his face.  Blue eyes, red lips, white skin, we always find him waving
his freest hand, we return the gesture same, and do not notice that wrist of
his, shackled to a pole. – Nothing becomes separated; this is all kept so much a
secret as history.

The ceremony nears: a final folding, the retirement of an empty smile, and
springish rains to give drink as life to the children tending gardens wet with
greeny greeny asphodels.  Though we cannot know, and only in the truest sweating
laughter does the satyr feel the hands upon the edges worn,  beginning to crease
and fold.

The lonely ones hear forest flutes being played in hidden Dionysian spirit.  The
lonely ones live alone, love the silence, and project upon the wall.

I could see it as this: the shackle set loose, the knife melted down, the smile
laid straight; his naked corpse, pulled flatly taught, is stretched beneath the
pole, which forever onward is freedom unadorned.  The folding ends as metallic
movement in a regret-less balanced song, played by lonely hands who’ve always
felt and known a certain distance from the notes.  The fabric squared, with
cross and all, is set upon a sacrificial altar piece, and with weights upon the
corners four, a flame  is manifest.

90.

Something misdirected(directed) within this expression, a manner of taking the
complicated network-expressions into immediate and blinding account; there seems
a sense beyond this, and with its word I am rarely familiar, and more often
scared.  The questions I pose with remedial intent do not suffice, and I suffer
the senses of the blind for this lack of inquisitive direction.  All questions
of meaning became a nihilist dream, arbitrary and ultimately abstracted.  My
mind’s delusion left its turn and in its place crept an escapable nothing.

Dyke to open up BBC archive

(billedtekst) Greg Dyke predicts a more public-focused broadcasting
future

Greg Dyke, director general of the BBC, has announced plans to give the
public full access to all the corporation's programme archives.

Mr Dyke said on Sunday that everyone would in future be able to
download BBC radio and TV programmes from the internet.

The service, the BBC Creative Archive,  would be free and available to
everyone, as long as they were not intending to use the material for
commercial purposes, Mr Dyke added.

"The BBC probably has the best television library in the world," said
Mr Dyke, who was speaking at the Edinburgh TV Festival.

"Up until now this huge resource has remained locked up, inaccessible
to the public because there hasn't been an effective mechanism for
distribution.

"But the digital revolution and broadband are changing all that.

"For the first time there is an easy and affordable way of making this
treasure trove of BBC content available to all."

He predicted that everyone would benefit from the online archive, from
people accessing the internet at home, children and adults using public
libraries, to students at school and university.

Future focus

Mr Dyke appeared at the TV festival to give the Richard Dunn interview,
one of the main events of the three-day industry event.

He said the new online service was part of the corporation's future, or
"second phase", strategy for the development of digital technology.

Mr Dyke said he believed this second phase would see a shift of
emphasis by broadcasters.

Their focus would move away from commercial considerations to providing
"public value", he said.

"I believe that we are about to move into a second phase of the digital
revolution, a phase which will be more about public than private value;
about free, not pay services; about inclusivity, not exclusion.

"In particular, it will be about how public money can be combined with
new digital technologies to transform everyone's lives."

Kari,

That would be great. Any input toward my general
questions is much appreciated. Also, how do you view
the slam community there? Is it more prominent than
other poetry communities? Does it differ from the East
Coast version? Have you ever participated? If you
would like to e-mail me contact info for people I
could speak with about this (pro and/or con), please
feel free to e-mail me directly. Otherwise, please
forward my e-mail address to your contacts.

Thanks again,
Flora

An interesting slam story.... Poet Victorio Reyes was kicked out of a slam
in the Midwest (cannot remember where) for being to political. He was very
disheartened by the experience because he had been competing down at the
Nuyorican, and had always thought of Poetry Slams and Open mics as venues to
open dialogue on Revolutionary ideology.

I think it stems from the fact the Slam Poetry has become mainstream and has
shifted to a good evening of entertainment as opposed to a space for
challenging discussions.

Yes, indeed, I remember the Cockettes fondly.  Sylvester's luscious sexy
voice, all the glitter, Chumbly's music, camp beyond camp -- so many gone,
lost to AIDS, such innocent delight -- Tricia's Wedding when Nixon fondled
Kissinger's dick -- such waves of nostalgia.  One day we will all become
Hibiscus.

"independent" writing fears the transcendental. Among its

widely varied pieces are an analysis of the ontology of Philip

K. Dick, a true parable about the unreliability of the written

Word, and support for Angelism as the new postmodern religion.

  I just happened upon the new Best Am Poetry of 2003, edited by Komunyakaa,
and noticed that his introduction is a rather rabid blast at what he sometimes
calls
"exploratory" poetry. I mean, this is really striking - beyond what you might
expect. Check it out and see what you think.

To my ear it seemed like a particular blast at Creeley (editor of last
year's volume) -- but maybe that is his way of clearing a space for himsel=
f
to unpack his own poetics?

Note how "exploratory poetry" is seen to a) grow out of Black Mountain
poetry and b) serve as a verbal equivalent of Rauschenberg's "erased
DeKooning drawing," (ie the total destruction of something beautiful for
the amusement of a few eggheads) (and further links to Al-Qaeda style
terrorism) (eggheads as terrorists)=2E  All in the name of a more populist=

poetics, the kind Pulitzer Prize winners practice=2E

I am pleased by this. I can approach her poetry with genuine respect while I
could not pick up either Collins or that other one without snickering. It's
not Creeley, as it should be, but it's better many other possible
candidates.

Just a clarification - the discount is for individual members of the

Ian,

Yes, I wonder if it stems from the competitive nature
of slams. Or the performance itself, somehow lessening
the content of the words on the page.

hi flora

you  might enjoy David Hess' Slam Diary at readme --
http://home.jps.net/~nada/hess.htm

i spent a couple years in Chicago in the early '90s & often went to the
Green Mill, where Marc Smith started The Slam ( circa '87). Smith rocks as a
performer, btw. had fun there, tho i often loathed the performers,
especially those who won solely because of the audience's taste for pop
culture references & lyrical cleverness. & it seemed the more smug the
performer the greater the applause (present in various poetry communities &
really puzzles me). occasionally, however, there would be a fab
poet/performer who would make up for the disappointments. Lisa Buscani was
one of them. Patricia Smith. so on.

re Reyes & the Midwest-- home of the slam (Chicago/ Ann Arbor) -- i have
difficulty with lumping (seemed to me implied in that post) political
intolerance with the Midwest in general, of course..wd like more details
about his ejection, might be a fun story.

pretty sure slams didn't start as political or urban/roots poetry so much as
any kind of performance poetry - rather, those genres flourished in slams
because of their everyman/emotional/dynamic appeal, commiseration &
accessibility & whatever else. i assume Nuyorican may've been an exception,
don't know. but i have noticed that the relationship between poetry
communities in Chicago back then was closer than what i sense now on the
east coast (there are no Official slam venues here in Philly, oddly).  i'm
unsure if that's due to historical or geo-cultural differences.  tho i've
not attended slams/spoken word/etc performances much on this coast, i get
the impression that the slam & spoken word are now geared toward a younger
crowd & have become more like soap boxes & reruns = predictable/formulaic/
relatively homogenized. guess that's unfair of me if i don't go or stay
informed.

i'm not exactly a fan yet i do appreciate the social significance. would
elaborate but i'm boring myself & feeling restless. i'll be happy to discuss
more b/c if you'd like.

Smith opens by singing  Makin' Poetry (Whoopie). dig that.

cha,
    hassen

The question in my mind is not about who is the poet laureate, for me the question is how does poetry survive in this environment where power is so concentrated and abused.

Okay, re: the aesthetics/ethics question, I don't have much more to say on it. When I saw the fine productions by the Gate Theater Co., I got it.

luv and kisses.

A while back someone was asking about a Watten book/paper/ essay on Techno
music. To my memory, that question wasn't answered. Is there something on it
in this latest book? I haven't been able to find any info on it on the web.

What areas does the piece (I have no idea what it is) cover? It would seem
that to discuss, say, Detroit techno, one would have to also include
Stockhausen and Boulez at least, if not Russolo and Varese amongst many many
others. And then there's the British, European, and Japanese techno
movements.. I'd imagine it's quite long, no?

It's not likely, since the Poet Laureate convention is based on British
tradition, but in the U.S., it would be more interesting to see this post
shared by "representatives."  Even a triumvirate might better reflect the
poetics of such a vast empire.  I'm not talking PC here.

Conjunctivitis, better known as Pink Eye, is an infection of the inside of your eyelid. It is usually caused by allergies, bacteria, viruses, or chemicals.

What are the signs and symptoms?
Red, irritated eye.
Some burning and/or scratchy feeling.
There may be a purulent (pus) or a mucous type discharge.
How is it treated?
It depends on what caused the Pink Eye. It may or may not need medication for treatment. If medication is given, follow the directions on the label.

What else do I need to know?
To prevent the spread of the infection:

Wash hands throughly
Before you use the medicine in your eyes.
After using the medicine in your eyes.
Everytime you touch your eyes or face.
Wash any clothing touched by infected eyes.
Clothes
Towels
Pillowcases
Do not share make-up. If the infection is caused by bacteria or a virus you must throw away your used make-up and buy new make-up.
Do not touch the infected eye because the infection will spread to the good eye. IMPORTANT!!!
Pink Eye Spreads Very Easily!

'The Constructivist Moment: from El Lissitzky to Detroit
Techno.' is the key essay in the book imho.

I can give a flavor of Watten's intro para to the piece:

'. . . the spatial figure for this essay is the crossing of borders between
incommensurate zones that have been constructed in Detroit's relatively
short but convulsive history. Inspired by Detroit, and challenged by the
many experiences of mutual exclusion one has when living there, I wanted to
make the most unlikely comparison possible to unveil the stakes of a radical
modernism trapped within the productivist lifeworld. What resulted was a
dual research project in which I turned to the work of El Lissitzky,
emblematic of radical modernism in its most formally articulated utopian
mode, and the recent development of the experimental electronic music known
as Detroit techno, as examples of the mutual permeability of radical form
and modern lifeworld. A poetics of negative exemplarity is the bridge
between the two, drawn out in contrasting modernist and postmodern examples
from Louis Zukovsky and Jean Day. This essay, then, is an exercise in
disjunction as much as conjunction, an attempt at the reciprocal
illumination of cultural possibilities that ought to have more to do with
each other, but because of the sterile framework of assigned cultural
values, do not.'

i recommend it

love and love

I don't know if anyone else has said it yet, but I find most of the poetry at Slams or Spoken Word events to be boring and very conventional.  It has such a strict aesthetic (rhyme, a rather stereotypical version of a black dialect, autobiographical content, boasting, etc) and does not really allow for much diversity.

The other thing that bothers me is the competitive nature of the events.  It sometimes reeks of a machismo that says winning (or sticking one's chest out the farthest) is more important than poetry.  This reinforces an individualist ideology that runs counter to the kind of collaborative, communal poetics most of us on this list, if I may presume, are interested in.

My 2 cents,

Grant

I should ask him... but I believe it was a major city and the particular
venue is known as the birthplace of slam. He told me that at this venue the
crowd can reject a poet first by snaping and then they continue by stomping
their feet. I will be sure to ask.

thank you for saying this-- Poetry Slams are a gimmick,  if you compare true
spoken word events like David Antin's talk pieces for example to the normal
Poetry Slam what you find is a set kind of rhyming, chant like verse that is
pretty much all the same. Also many of the Slam "poets" move very close to
rap music. Now having said this there is a long tradition (back to Homer) of
sung bardic poetics, but Slam "poetry" is not this.  Also, and I think this
is important, much of slam poetry is stereotypical.  I went to the Def
Poetry Jam last year in NY and after the first 'poet' my wife and I were
reciting the rhyme scheme to each other under our voices.

the best commentary I can make is that the number one poetry book sold in
1856 was not Leaves of Grass and no one today remembers that poetry book--
and Poetry Slam will suffer the same fate

Louise GLuck is an interesting choice I like her as person very much but as
a poet?? I think that they ought to do something fun Rachel Blau DuPlessis
for poet laureate!!!!!!!!!!!!! that would shake things up.. But what would
Bill Moyers have to ask her????????? I would kill however to see someone
like Professor DuPlessis reading at the Dodge Festival.

Subject:      Slam a poem
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I should have read Hassen's post first because now I am fairly certain that
Victorio was ejected in Chicago. I can imagine that his work would be
considerably offensive to an audience that was politically moderate, but I,
and most of the poetry communities I have experienced, have become
accustomed to politically challenging work.

What I begun to find fustrating with slams is that poets who compete often
fail to challenge themselves by using new forms, or by experimenting with
form. I believe that this stems from the desire to communicate to as many
people as possible and by not attempting to offend or make the audience
uncomfortable. I am also fustrated with the emphasis on style which has
become the driving force for slam.

All this being said, slam has and will continue to introduce young poets
into a community of artists where these discussions are relevent and
important. One of the major contributions of slam is that it has created an
artistic community that is not dependant on the established networks of
universities and other state funded institutions. For the most part, Slams
and open mics have begun to create a network beyond official censorship.
What I found upsetting about the incident with Victorio was that without the
presence of state officials and police, that an audience decided to censor a
poet on their own.

I am still waiting for someone to perform a sound poem in a slam.

Wired News
Today's Tech-Dependent Activists
By Amit Asaravala
02:00 AM Aug. 28, 2003 PT

In addition to picket signs and megaphones, activists protesting
globalization policies at next month's meeting of
the World Trade Organization in Canc=FAn will be armed with a number of
new, high-tech weapons for getting their message
across.

These include using peer-to-peer networks to distribute video to
television stations and setting up wireless access
points so that activists can post updates to their weblogs. The aim is
to help demonstrators make a bigger impact, even
with fewer people, say protest organizers.

"Technology gives us the ability to shift the power in the protest to
the dissidents," said Rabble, an activist with
the Independent Media Center who requested that his real name not be
used. "It's an incredible tactical advance from
the days when the police were the only ones with a reliable
communications network during protests."

During the WTO meeting, which will take place from Sept. 10 to 14,
Rabble and others plan to use a peer-to-peer
video-sharing service called v2v to transmit broadcast-quality video of
the protests to television stations and other activists.

They also will set up wireless networks at the protest welcome center in
the nearby town of Ciudad Canc=FAn, and will
stream audio recordings of interviews and speeches over the Internet for
rebroadcast on participating radio stations.

The technologies are part of a growing collection of modern protest
tactics, many of which originated during the highly
publicized anti-WTO demonstrations that took place in Seattle in
November 1999.

"There are always technological developments in activist practices,"
said activist Mike Bonanno. "Since 1999, the
importance of e-mail lists and Web publishing to help organize people on
the ground and disseminate information
has not diminished."

Bonanno is a member of the Yes Men, a group that builds parody websites
as a way to protest the policies of various
organizations.

During the Seattle protests in 1999, the Yes Men launched GATT.org to
protest the WTO. He says the group will continue
updating the site during the Canc=FAn meeting as a way to point out what
they believe are flaws in the WTO's policies.

"We plan to use the GATT.org website to continue representing the
positions of the WTO more honestly than
they care to represent themselves," said Bonanno. "This has always been
a goal of ours: to explain how WTO policies hurt
the poor and the environment, but doing it with a healthy dose of
satire."

Representatives of the WTO did not respond to requests for comment.

Surprisingly, one high-tech protest tactic that is likely to be absent
from this year's demonstration is the use of
distributed denial-of-service attacks to shut down the WTO website.

The electrohippies, a British group that called for such attacks during
the 1999 meeting, have since disbanded. And
many protest organizers today say they would not support such an attack
if another group made a similar call.

"Taking down the website might be fun and headline-grabbing, but I
personally don't think it's a good tactic," said
Rabble. "The WTO does not function because its website stays up; it
functions because corporations and governments give
it tremendous power."

Another tactic that is not likely to make an appearance is the use of
mailing lists to create "flash mobs," a way of
mobilizing large groups of people by sending out a single message to
awaiting recipients.

"The 'flash mob' concept generally works best when enough people are
around to receive e-mail and react quickly," said
Bonanno. "It gets more difficult if such communications technologies are
not available to people."

Just 10 percent of Mexico's population regularly goes online, according
to the country's Internet association,
AMIPCI. The percentage is expected to be lower on the Yucat=E1n =
peninsula,
where Canc=FAn is located, because of
poverty in the jungle-covered region.

Despite this, organizers say they are confident that the available
technologies will allow them to mobilize
participants more effectively than ever before.

"Even with the distance and expense associated with getting to and
protesting in Canc=FAn, we're expecting between 10,000
and 20,000 people to participate," said Starhawk, an organizer with the
RANT Collective.

"The Internet has allowed us to have a different kind of global
conversation," she said. "Organizing for Canc=FAn
wouldn't be as effective without it."

The Post includes Louise Gluck ("rhymes with pick") 's "favorite dead
poets."

My favorite dead poets include the following:
Ted Berrigan
Joe Ceravolo
Henri Michaux
Richard Brautigan
all of whom, I believe, died in the early 1980s.

My favorite live poets include the following:
Anselm Hollo
Alice Notley
Linh Dinh
Eleni Sikelianos

My new favorite prose writer is Laird Hunt, whose Indiana, Indiana has
just been published by Coffee House.

A Google search for "famous dead poets" brings up way too many
references to Dead Poets' Society.

Ian-
sounds like the Green Mill alright. if so, i highly doubt it was solely
because of his political content (what i remember of it, i wouldn't, by any
means, describe the usual audience to be 'politically moderate.' if your
friend's poetry & presentation were conservative i would better understand
such a  response). depending on the crowd, some nights were like the Apollo.
. .

    h

while i agree with much of what's been said re this topic, here's my
devil's advocate bit without too much delving (little time at the moment):
i've found slam/spoken word to be more 'cross-over.'it would be somewhat
absurd to hear an experimental composer spend much time critiquing mary j or
to not acknowledge the benefits of hip hop/popular r&b music. while it's
great to have preferences & engage in critical conversation, it's
counter-productive for other poetry communities to  reject the significance
(or validity) of slam/spoken word based on a certain common or conventional
aesthetic** - especially if it reflects a group or poet's struggle for
voice. as we all know, poetry, thankfully, doesn't belong to an elite. many
advantages of having this stuff out there. sometimes it's informative or
maybe necessary for an element of solidarity, i don't know. but sometimes
(on the rare occasion for me anyway) it's just *fun.*

**use of the term 'conventional,' of course, is relative.  i certainly can
say the same about most poetry i read/hear, in any genre. in most anything
at all i read/hear from humans, so where does that leave us...

so far as this incident at the Green Mill (or wherever),  the theater is
not, i think, always an improper place to encourage or discourage
performance.

Grant,

I'll second that.  Have never respected "slams," found their atmosphere
particularly attractive, or wanted to buy a book by a slammer (how could it
be read twice?).  If this is an "elitist opinion," so be it.

Anyway, add a coupla pennies to the pot, and I'm pissin in it, too.

I've been following this discussion -- as I did the one I only dimly
remember a while ago -- with renewed interest, as each American metro
area has a different slam / performance poetry.  Here in Los Angeles, of
course, the racial division is obvious, and as the person who started
this thread backchanneled to me, African American performance poetry,
post-punk / diy performance poetry / art / music, and plain ol'
performance poetry, while they overlap, and probably most in slams, are
divisions everywhere, and she is locating some of this in the griot
tradition, which attribution and distinction, I might add, has been a
VERY DIVISIVE AND POLITICAL ISSUE here in LA.

I'm testing out what I know are prejudices of mine about LA local poetry
/ performance poetry because 1) this is hotly under debate now on our
own lists, 2) it really is, in my opinion, save for the Watts Writers
Workshop students of students, one of the worst places to hear a poetry
reading of any stripe.

White performance poetry in LA is not the vibrant multicultural slam and
performance scenes which are not white, or those which are really visual
art or music.  The community is knee-jerk anti-intellectual, more than a
little bubba political, and insular.

Local performance poets without college degrees rarely or belatedly
pursue them, and performance poets without graduate degrees rarely
pursue them.  Constant performance is avocation or hobby, and it is
common to participate in four to as many as sixteen open mike nights (at
3 hours per) a month.  Most performance poets take private classes
(generally actors here take loads of private classes, so, etc.) from
other local performance poets in which exercises are assigned, and these
produce the work memorized and performed (you can trace the exercises
through the open mike nights).

A large quantity of money is spent on self publication and on private
workshops (for example, about the same amount of money as tuition at the
local public colleges), and those who are not self-publishing or taking
workshops from certain local performance poets are not particularly
welcome.  Almost all of the venues are alcohol free (most participants
are twelve stepping.  Many poems are related to "drunkalogs"), but these
venues include

1) almost every Barnes & Noble, Borders, Bookstar, etc. in the major
metro area,
2) almost every cute coffee shop,
3) many museums / cultural institutes,
4) the branch libraries.

Most venues which do not have an open mike featuring this group of white
poets do not allow poetry readings of any kind because they do not want
an open mike featuring this group of poets.  These poets do not attend
readings of poets outside the circle.

So, perhaps I'm wrong, this is a vibrant community doing vital work and
I'm a space alien?

Be well,
Catherine Daly

Hi all,

Hanging out in SF with the poet Kent Taylor, and he passed this information on
to me about the death of Lawrence Fixel.

Here's the obit that ran in yesterday's SF Chronicle.

as ever,
David

----------------------

Lawrence Fixel -- poet for more than 70 years

San Francisco poet Lawrence Fixel, whose quizzical and contemplative works
often explored the paradoxes of life, has died.

Mr. Fixel, whose writing career spanned more than 70 years, died of natural
causes early Sunday morning at his home. He was 86.

Although not so widely known as the Beat generation writers synonymous with
San Francisco's literary history, Mr. Fixel was nevertheless an influential
poet whose manuscripts, journals and letters appear alongside those of
Lawrence Ferlinghetti and others at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library.

"It reflects his status as a prose poet," said Bill Brown, a researcher at the
library.

Mr. Fixel was perhaps best known for his prose poems, long-form works more
akin to short stories, and for parables likened to those of Franz Kafka and
Jorges Luis Borges.

"In quizzical, contemplative prose poems and parables, he presents characters
in transit, and deftly illuminates the complex of enigmas and paradoxes
inherent in their often simple journeys," Publishers Weekly said of Mr.
Fixel's last book, "Truth, War and Dream-Game."

He drew inspiration from his experiences during some of the most formative
events of the 20th century, from the Great Depression to World War II to the
tumult of the 1960s.

"He did see a lot of the world, and he absorbed it all and distilled it all, "
said Jack Marshall, a poet who had known Mr. Fixel since 1968. "If a person
were to read his work for the first time and not know his life, they'd think
he had very little experience with the outside world. But he did, and he
distilled it all."

Mr. Fixel was born in Brooklyn and raised in White Plains, N.Y., where his
father owned a sporting goods store. He began writing in high school after
being encouraged by an English teacher who saw promise in his work.

Mr. Fixel was just 19 when he returned to New York during the Depression and
found work with the Federal Writers Project, a part of the Works Progress
Administration. Working alongside the likes of Richard White and Ralph
Ellison,

Mr. Fixel earned $18.75 a week writing about the architecture of New York's
churches for a guidebook of the city.

After three years with the FWP, Mr. Fixel moved to Los Angeles, where he lived
briefly and married his first wife before serving three years in the merchant
marine during World War II. He sailed throughout the South Pacific before
being sent to New York City to work aboard a ship carrying troops to Europe.
He later served one year in the Army.

Mr. Fixel was divorced shortly after the war. He remarried in 1954.

He moved to San Francisco in 1950. He soon fell in with the writers of the
day, including Langston Hughes, Dylan Thomas and, later, George Hitchcock, who
published the literary magazine "Kayak."

Always a prolific writer, Mr. Fixel's first collection of poems, "The Scale of
Silence," was published in 1970 when he was 53 years old. Four more books
followed during the next 10 years. His most recent book, "Truth, War and the
Dream-Game," was published in 1992.

Although best known for his prose poems, Mr. Fixel wrote beautiful verse
poems, which friends and scholars called noteworthy for their lyrical writing
and vivid imagery. They cited "Song for the Ending of the Year" as an example:

One by one the subjects disappear:

The gift of speech is going with the year,

In company with silence and with fear.

The package on the table waits to be untied.

The Child, the Tree are left inside the House --

No message from the crucified.

We ride the painted hobby-horse of day,

Or stand aside, or join the latest craze --

Next year's another box, another maze.

"It's so disillusioned, yet the language is calm and clear and lyrical," Mr.

Marshall said. "It's disillusioning, but it's beautifully said. I find a dark
joy in it."

The poem also highlights the economy of words for which Mr. Fixel was known.

"He had a propensity to condense his ideas and thoughts into the smallest
possible space," Mr. Marshall said.

Mr. Fixel continued writing, giving readings and teaching at poetry workshops
until just a couple of years ago.

daughter, Kate Frankel of Irvine; his sister, Pearl Berkelman of San
Francisco;

Thank you, David Kirschenbaum, for posting this=2E

I always thought Lawrence Fixel would be around forever=2E

He will be missed by many=2E

He was there when Spicer had his confrontation with Langston Hughes on a
Marin houseboat =2E =2E =2E  (Due to Hughes' troubles with HUAC etc, he wa=
s not
allowed to speak on the campus at SF State after he had been invited there=

& so the organizers had to scramble for another venue for his reading)=2E=20=

Fixel looked the same for 20 years, a kind of male Diana Vreeland (in
looks) (very different writing style)=2E  Farewell to a great heart!

Hi all,

Hanging out in SF with the poet Kent Taylor, and he passed this informatio=
n
on
to me about the death of Lawrence Fixel=2E

Here's the obit that ran in yesterday's SF Chronicle=2E

as ever,
David

----------------------

Lawrence Fixel -- poet for more than 70 years

San Francisco poet Lawrence Fixel, whose quizzical and contemplative works=

often explored the paradoxes of life, has died=2E

Mr=2E Fixel, whose writing career spanned more than 70 years, died of natu=
ral
causes early Sunday morning at his home=2E He was 86=2E

Although not so widely known as the Beat generation writers synonymous wit=
h
San Francisco's literary history, Mr=2E Fixel was nevertheless an influent=
ial
poet whose manuscripts, journals and letters appear alongside those of
Lawrence Ferlinghetti and others at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library=2E

"It reflects his status as a prose poet," said Bill Brown, a researcher at=

the
library=2E

Mr=2E Fixel was perhaps best known for his prose poems, long-form works mo=
re
akin to short stories, and for parables likened to those of Franz Kafka an=
d
Jorges Luis Borges=2E

"In quizzical, contemplative prose poems and parables, he presents
characters
in transit, and deftly illuminates the complex of enigmas and paradoxes
inherent in their often simple journeys," Publishers Weekly said of Mr=2E
Fixel's last book, "Truth, War and Dream-Game=2E"

He drew inspiration from his experiences during some of the most formative=

events of the 20th century, from the Great Depression to World War II to t=
he
tumult of the 1960s=2E

"He did see a lot of the world, and he absorbed it all and distilled it
all, "
said Jack Marshall, a poet who had known Mr=2E Fixel since 1968=2E "If a p=
erson
were to read his work for the first time and not know his life, they'd thi=
nk
he had very little experience with the outside world=2E But he did, and he=

distilled it all=2E"

Mr=2E Fixel was born in Brooklyn and raised in White Plains, N=2EY=2E, whe=
re his
father owned a sporting goods store=2E He began writing in high school aft=
er
being encouraged by an English teacher who saw promise in his work=2E

Mr=2E Fixel was just 19 when he returned to New York during the Depression=
 and
found work with the Federal Writers Project, a part of the Works Progress
Administration=2E Working alongside the likes of Richard White and Ralph
Ellison,

Mr=2E Fixel earned $18=2E75 a week writing about the architecture of New Y=
ork's
churches for a guidebook of the city=2E

After three years with the FWP, Mr=2E Fixel moved to Los Angeles, where he=

lived
briefly and married his first wife before serving three years in the
merchant
marine during World War II=2E He sailed throughout the South Pacific befor=
e
being sent to New York City to work aboard a ship carrying troops to Europ=
e=2E
He later served one year in the Army=2E

Mr=2E Fixel was divorced shortly after the war=2E He remarried in 1954=2E

He moved to San Francisco in 1950=2E He soon fell in with the writers of t=
he
day, including Langston Hughes, Dylan Thomas and, later, George Hitchcock,=

who
published the literary magazine "Kayak=2E"

Always a prolific writer, Mr=2E Fixel's first collection of poems, "The Sc=
ale
of
Silence," was published in 1970 when he was 53 years old=2E Four more book=
s
followed during the next 10 years=2E His most recent book, "Truth, War and=
 the
Dream-Game," was published in 1992=2E

Although best known for his prose poems, Mr=2E Fixel wrote beautiful verse=

poems, which friends and scholars called noteworthy for their lyrical
writing
and vivid imagery=2E They cited "Song for the Ending of the Year" as an
example:

One by one the subjects disappear:

The gift of speech is going with the year,

In company with silence and with fear=2E

The package on the table waits to be untied=2E

The Child, the Tree are left inside the House --

No message from the crucified=2E

We ride the painted hobby-horse of day,

Or stand aside, or join the latest craze --

Next year's another box, another maze=2E

"It's so disillusioned, yet the language is calm and clear and lyrical," M=
r=2E

Marshall said=2E "It's disillusioning, but it's beautifully said=2E I find=
 a
dark
joy in it=2E"

The poem also highlights the economy of words for which Mr=2E Fixel was kn=
own=2E

"He had a propensity to condense his ideas and thoughts into the smallest
possible space," Mr=2E Marshall said=2E

Mr=2E Fixel continued writing, giving readings and teaching at poetry
workshops
until just a couple of years ago=2E

He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Justine Fixel of San Francisco; hi=
s
daughter, Kate Frankel of Irvine; his sister, Pearl Berkelman of San
Francisco;

and two grandchildren=2E

It strikes me that the best laureate would be someone about whom people
could argue and disagree vigorously.

If the laureate is considered blah, what point is there in having such a
poet as laureate? To show another generation of kids that poetry is blah?

The political modes inherent behind east-coasty Poetry Society of American,
Academy of American Poets, etc, are about as follows, aren't they?: that
poetry is nice, poets are nice, poetry audiences are nice. These societies
give "awards," when in fact, considering the way many poets choose and have
chosen over the centuries to write, poets should be given "medals," insofar
as many choose to write in ways idiolectic, needling, hectoring, braying,
cajoling, challenging, frustrating, polemical, jeremiacal, or just
otherwise nonplussing -- *While Still* upholding their ancient duties of
benediction and malediction, praise and blame, comfort and affliction.

Too I wonder, in a political economy of consumption, can we really
understand the value of spiritual challenge as a cultural force?  We
Americans understand only Niceness, something that'll go down the throat
like yoghurt.

The nearest a poet recently came to being a part of our national public
discourse, it was Baraka, I'd guess, with the NJ Laureateship and "Somebody
Blew Up America." It was a story of poetry in contest.

The US laureateship doesn't seem to be about getting poetry to enter public
discourse. If it did, would it not *not* shrink from controversy, but
instead rise to make it? Or at least rise to join it? Isn't poetry at its
best when it joins with the controversies of the polis to resolve, bless,
twist, or sway our hearts and minds in those areas where we feel the most
is at stake? These would be the areas with which poetry could best help us:
where we grow confused or where we join contest in order to en-join further
contest.

Further, I wonder to what degree, and in what sense, a poetry which has so
long carried the ideology of private emotionalism, private speech and
private sentiment, as American (and much of current Western late-romantic)
poetries have for so long -- how such a poetry, which is about the private
[*vide infra], can truly be a part of the polis, of the discourse of the
polis. Especially if we also consider the passivity that mainstream
American pedagogy demands of its students as cultural consumers, the
passive reception of poetry by a mostly boggled and bored audience. For if,
as Aristotle said, that to be fully human means to engage in the life of
the polis, then what does it mean to have a poet who embodies the
ideologies of insular emotionalism and possessive individualism in a public
position? The Greek root for "idiot" meant a private person.

Can we truly have a public poet if that poet writes a poetry of the private?

in poems and stories, the alienation of the poet from our society") to Dave

So, I just got back from giving Eileen Doman, an artist in my new book,
DaDaDa (Salt Publishing, 2003), a copy.  She's in town because a
childhood friend of hers (who is apparently a very well known, renowned
even, head of ESL at the infamous Belmont Learning Academy) is dying.

She's in the book because she is a (self-taught) painter who wants to
teach art.  She does teach a bit, finds it difficult, but she values
teaching, especially teaching painting and drawing, and would really
love to do it more.  She's a bit disappointed her daughter wants to go
to medical school someday (she's only 18), instead of becoming an art
teacher, for example.

Now, Eileen Doman did not go to college; another person at lunch was
encouraging her to set up a private workshop.  I stayed quiet.

Several poets here in LA who are not white local performance poets who
either lack a college degree or graduate degree and want to teach or do
teach.  Several white local performance poets teaching in private
workshops have MFAs and several have BAs.  So am I just decrying a
working, self-reinforcing economy which has crushed the other ones that
are in competition elsewhere because I think its products are mediocre /
it excludes me?

I still think the local performance poets would be better off in school,
though. It's embarrassing two ways -- they get kicked out of chain
bookstores because they are behave like children and call it art & the
English classes (hence all of the creative writing) in the colleges,
including the one built in response to the Watts riots, are mostly
taught by white nonwriting / nonperforming academics.

Be well,

  American pedagogy demands of its students as cultural consumers, the
  passive reception of poetry by a mostly boggled and bored audience. =
For if,
  as Aristotle said, that to be fully human means to engage in the life =
of
  the polis, then what does it mean to have a poet who embodies the
  ideologies of insular emotionalism and possessive individualism in a =
public
  position? The Greek root for "idiot" meant a private person.

  Can we truly have a public poet if that poet writes a poetry of the =
private?

Although in my heart I agree with you, I know that I
have to remain as objective as possible in my piece.
I'm interested in why people find this the most
accessible way to approach poetry. I think the
MTV-ization of poetry is a bigger issue than the slams
themselves, and I sometimes have to remind myself of
the difference between "spoken word" and "slam."
Anyway, the situation here is that there is a paltry
and underformed arts community, and I feel that the
slam and, by extension, spoken word, are the only ways
people here know poetry. I think that's akin to
knowing a great book by the movie that was made from
it.Additionally, since slams are competitive, the idea
of a community almost seems contradictory -- how can
competitors really begin to talk about poetry without
involving their egos?

Because I think the acto f seeing the words on the
page, and facing the text without the benefit of cues
from the reader or an entrtaining floor show, can make
a piece more challenging, or determine whether or not
the piece stands on its own.

Yes, all of these discussions obviously involve ego,
but the situation is heightened by that feeling of
acceptance and winning. The "pep rally" aspect brings
the communication of a competitor's work into the
utterly public realm -- there is almost no intimacy
involved. It is a theatrical experience. So, how do
these actors, competing at this never-ending audition,
truly sit down to discuss their craft without
constantly considering those auditions?

dear po-friends: i'm puzzled by some of the conservatism i see in
these anti-slam posts.  while i agree that there has become a kind of
cliched and/or commodified "slam" or "spoken word" style, who says
the standard for the poetic experience has to be characterized by
"intimacy" or "the act of seeing words on the page" with no cues from
the performer?  a lot of very interesting writers spent time in slam
culture, including tracie morris, edwin torres, paul beatty, and
others. sure there are mediocre slammers but aren't there mediocre
artists in any genre?  they play a part too --they contribute to the
thickening of the discourse that creates a "scene."  does anyone know
an artist who does *not* have an ego, as if this were such a terrible
thing (do you really think David Antin --whom i adore --has less of
an "ego" than, say, Edwin Torres or Ishle Park? get real!)?  the
criticism about competition is a canard: what about the competitions
to get into MFA programs, to win those book competitions, to get
grants, etc.  the slam is a *mock* competition, designed to get the
audience invested in the whole picture and not just their one friend
who is reading in the line-up. it may be that the slam's time has
come and gone. i myself don't go to slams any more, dont' find them
that interesting, for some of the reasons folks have cited
(repetition, decibel level, ossification and commodification of a
certain style of delivery, etc).  but this stuff about poems
"standing on their own," "intimacy," competition being a no-no,
sitting down to "discuss [one's] craft" as if this were a requisite
for being a "real poet" etc etc etc --this is, excuse me, a rehearsal
of the cliches comprising the veriest lowest common denominator of
privatistic bourgeois liberal humanism.  i apologize for my
crankiness --these first-posts-of-the-morning before my internal
censor has woken up are often like this.  but i see some of the old
cliches about poetry creeping in to this slam discussion and they
are, for me, red flags (yes i am a taurus, so there you have it). ok
basta, over n out...md

Maria,
You and I have had this discussion before. It seems my
posts make you angrier than anyone elses. Maybe it's
b/c we are both Tauruses.
Of course, my experience of poetry is my own, but the
"intimacy" and discussions you dismiss are the things
that truly nourish me and inspire me to write in
relation to other writers. What we're doing on this
site is discussing craft, or politics, or whatever,
but it does include poetry, and that's the whole
reason I participate here. And your arguments and
point of view are exactly the kinds of things I am
interested in -- people are passionate about this
subject. My article has to be fair, and if people
think that it's somehow outdated or irrelevent for a
poem to stand on it's own, then why? My point being,
if slam poetry doesn't need discussion, or initimacy
or to stand on its own, then isn't it something
different, something else? And Do you think it's
better b/c of it? I get the feeling you think my
opinion is an elitist thing, and maybe it is. I also
qualified my ego comment to avoid anyone saying that
all artists have ego, of course they do, I don't know
if you could create without one. But I'm not sure, was
what you said an argument against poetry as I
traditionally spoke about it, or for slam poetry? Or
both?
Also, why does it take competition to get the audience
passionate and involved? I think this is a fundamental
question that ties into the way we use media, and I
want to explore this. And yes, there is mediocrity
everywhere, but that was never my contention. I am
trying to understand how the writing process differs,
how the audience's relationship differs, and why so
many people find it more compelling than other more
traditional forms. Is the experience of reading aslam
poet for a slam audience member the same, or does it
require the performance? Some people have told me slam
is a class issue, others say it's a generational
thing. My point is, I don't want to argue, I just want
to know.

my horoscope this a.m. said to make art happen

one of my reading series is supposed to give writers who teach a place
to read with their (adult, generally) students outside of a slam or open
mike night, i.e., the much ballyhooed noncompetitive environment; this
series replaces a poetry open mike which devolved into jumping around on
study tables shouting when the mc went off his medication about the time
the war in Afghanistan started

Much white Southern California performance poetry is stand up comedy or
sentimentalized domestic neosurrealism.  (Kenneth Koch was last year's
amusing fad.) This is working class poetry (white performance poetry),
and poetry written by teenagers.  Slam-poetry-in-decline derides poetry
different from the mean as elitist.  The few (McDaniel, Alexie, no one
here has heard of Morris) became "superstars" who cannot be criticized a
long time ago.  Fewer and fewer "superstars" emerge -- emerging means
leaving the circle (the best of our local white performance poets don't
want to "emerge", they tell me)

The page doesn't have to be addressed, obviously -- things like
different dictions and tones, ways that spoken grammar differs from
written -- I find it disturbing that sound effects are being blanched
out of the poems.  Like entertainment, there has been a continual
ratcheting down of quality -- at an OC slam a few months ago, my
disappointed white performance poet teammates said, after I read, "holy
s___, why did you read your real work?" Part of the reason, aside from
the fact that some of my poems are meant to be read aloud or heard, to
be in the mouth or ear, is that Dana Gioia (considered locally to be a
poetry "superstar" & referred to as "Chairman Gioia") reads (Weldon
Kees') fiction at slams.

Be well,
Catherine Daly

also, both "spoken word" traditions and "slams"
predate their American incarnations: the oral ecstatic
tradition certainly didn't start with the Arab and
Urdu poets, but that's the milieu I know best:

my favorite is when two talented poets get into into a
(mock) feud and start reciting couplets back and forth
to each other--magical.

i saw this one reading at the DIA center where Alice
Notley was reading (I think from "Disobedience") and I
was thinking of a poetry slam:

the definitions became less useful I guess the more
you think about them.

well that's a quick thought or two,

blessings to all the workers of the world!
solidarity with all workers' and peoples' movements!
let all the systems of alienation and exploitation be
swept away in a field of flowers and friendship!
celebrate labor day by closing your bank account and
cashing in all your stocks!
u.s. out of the phillipines!
u.s. out of iraq!
um um um um power to the people!

Maybe not couplets exactly, but something like this, Kazim?

Of course I tried to tell him
but he cranked his head
       without an excuse.
I told him the sky chases
       the sun
And he smiled and said:
       'What's the use,'
I was feeling like a demon
       again
So I said: 'But the ocean chases
       the fish.'
This time he laughed
       and said: 'Suppose the
              strawberry were
              pushed into a mountain.'
After that I knew the
       war was on--
So we fought:
He said: 'The apple-cart like a
              broomstick-angel
         snaps & splinters
                     old dutch shoes.'
I said: 'Lightning will strike the old oak
          and free the fumes!'
He said: 'Mad street with no name.'
I said: 'Bald killer! Bald killer! Bald killer!'
He said, getting real mad,
        'Firestoves! Gas! Couch!'
I said, only smiling,
        'I know God would turn back his head
        if I sat quietly and thought.'
We ended by melting away,
       hating the air!

Mime-Version: 1.0

    Actually going to slams reminds me often that it is not a "new" form,
but a very old one--back to poetry competitions with huge audiences in
Ireland or say in ancient Rome.  (And how would you like to compete with
Caligula--!--) I am sure one could cite a great many examples going back a
great deal of time from all over the world, in various modes.
     Part of why people like being in slams, from my experience, is that you
get instant recognition--or rejection!  But you are for sure "making the
scene".  You are being heard--and seen!
     The slam scenes I have known reminded me also of the music
scene--cliques, stars, wannabes, hangers on.
    Going to a lot of poeryr scenes and shows is much the same, just keyed
at a different volume.  The roles of written words and spoken, or slammed,
words--are different, hence the variations in the vocalisation, the crowd
atmosphere.  In a poetry reading, the winner, so to speak, is already
determined--it is the poet who will read for the evening.
     In the other, part of the thrill is simply to see who will win, to be a
part of the process that will lead to a person who will in turn become a
person who may "read for an evening"--
     Since the area of poetry that interests me are  visual and sound
poetries, "Poetry of the Intersign" in the words of Phildelpho
Menezes--these of course alter the presentation in terms of visual
notations, as well as written ones--it opens up the ways of hearing and
seeing poeryr in all its forms and presentations--
     One may dispense of words entirely--or mix them in--as visual signs,
cues, notatations--or as emphatic insertions of meanings within a sonic
range--or a visual array--
     I find Maria Damon's comments a bit bizarre--after all, if people are
interested in forming a group of fellow writers to disuss their craft--
this occurs in any area of writing I know of.
     Often the "Language Poets" referred to themselves as not a movement,
but a community of writers.
"Intimacy"--is being shared in the group responces, not just as something
isolated on the page.
As for a "poem standing on its own"--at some level that is what poems are in
the process of trying to achieve.
    After all, the winner at a slam and her or his poem, stand alone--above
the  others--
     The poet giving the reading stands alone--
     I think that Stalin and Company, especially with the Third Party
Writer's Congress, would have welcomed Maria Damon's lines:
(re intimacy, discussion of craft, a poem standing on its own):

"This is, excuse me, a rehearsal of cliches comprising the veriest lowest
common denominator of privatistic liberal humanism."

     I wonder if Caligula would not also agree!

     The example of  Mail Art offers a much different way of presenting and
sharing art/poetic works, outside the capitalist exchange networks, choices
of winners, privileging of one sort ot art/poetry over another, one
community of writers being "more right/write" than others--

     I was wondering--if a poem  is not supposed to stand on its own--where
then does it stand? And who decides for it where it will stand--
     If there is no discussion among writers re their craft--where do the
poems come from?
     An Act of God as the insurance people say--or an Edict from the
State--or being voted into office?

     Or--found--found poetry--

     It is the culminating weekend of the 100th Anjniversary of Harley
Davidson here in Milwaukee.
     There have been biker poetry readings, biker movies, biker books, tens
of thousands of Harleys riding about--Harley art shows, Harley souvenirs,
the rich and varied sounds of Harleys and their riders--
     One could say overall a perfomance scene mixing the public, the private
and the corporate--

     Labor Day!  a happy and safe one to all--

i agree w/ much of what you say in what i've deleted. i'm responding
to the below.

>...
>     I find Maria Damon's comments a bit bizarre--after all, if people are
>interested in forming a group of fellow writers to disuss their craft--
>this occurs in any area of writing I know of.
>     Often the "Language Poets" referred to themselves as not a movement,
>but a community of writers.

my issue wasn't with community or discussion but with what i felt
what a fetishizing of the notion of "craft."  slams are community
formations for sure, and slam culture is often very community-based.

>
>"Intimacy"--is being shared in the group responces, not just as something
>isolated on the page.

my point exactly.  there is intimacy in the performer's breath, body
language, voice timbre etc.  not just in the private reading
experience.

>As for a "poem standing on its own"--at some level that is what poems are in
>the process of trying to achieve.


not necessarily.  poems have contexts. slam poems especially. in my
reading the implication was that if a poem doesn't "stand on its own"
on a white page, it's not a poem. that's what i was taking issue with.

"laureates" though exist to support the state. a
laureate could exist to promote free expression, the
actualization of the self, etc etc but "laureates"
have usually existed in order to promote Empire--best
example Virgil.

I personally find Louise Gluck dark, apocalyptic,
gothic, and not a little bit scary: like the suburban
housewife from hell. with anorexia. Not Helen but
Oenone.

So I'm down with that Gluck noise.

"i can't escape death. it is always there. it troubles my dreams. i find
myself dying. i find myself decaying. my body is my loss. i feel it slip
away. i am confounded. there is nothing i can do."

"little simple romantic poem:
"Country Fire"

"the firebells bray at night;
"the countryside grows chokedly in flame;
"we attempt to flee the holocaust,
"are turned back, from the crossroads, in pain.

"in our dry light and open rafters
"we find reflected only traces
"of our being; aghast, we stare upon ourselves
"in contemplation of our hollow faces.

"from every eave, from every black, charred beam,
"from all burnt corners, all seared broken boards
"that stare exposed, no longer name a room,
"we read our parts, of chattels, not of lords."

"Cain

"Did you know what would be there, among your rotten hills?
"The vileness that destiny has pressed upon you?
"In filth and vengeance, see the crowd that mills,
"The cross upon his brow, the rain of glows!
"His eyes transfixed by spears, he staggers home;
"His claws are torn in blood, and still they come!
"His cracking body, broken teeth with foam,
"Proclaim the bawdy nights, the flow of rum.

"Wenches screaming in a thousand poses,
"Gambling wildly, in all sorts of ruses,
"Returning home to take the ready doses,
"To ease his steady pain and salve his bruises:

"Found bottle on the table, candle in the parlor;
"Knife on the bench and glass in the cupboard;
"Danced in circles with a thousand harlots,
"Feeling tense and turning, burning in the discord!

"His mother good as dead, his father gone,
"His brother in his bed in his dark room--
"He pushed aside the curtains with a groan,
"And in his wild frenzy caught his doom!

"And ours. For who can tell--that mark that lay upon him
"Might yet be our god. And now you know the rest--
"His body smashed, His heart,His eyes gouged out,
"He lies upon the Crossroads, Cain's bequest."

By "intimacy", I did not mean the intimacy of reading
alone, but the intimacy of the audience's relationship
to the readers at slams. And it's more of a question
on my part. If the competition is more about the
performance and instant rejection or acceptance, does
the actual work itself (the content, message) get lost
in the "show"? Is the ultimate goal of a slam to
communicate or to win? And should poetry communicate
something at all times -- be it a feeling, an idea,
etc? And is the poem itself the thing, or is it the
performance?

As for "stand alone", I meant, can it still touch the
reader or be compelling without being performed? Or,
if it were just read, not performed, would it still
carry an effect? I've always thought that it should.
And my question was then, does slam poetry do this, or
does it exist best in the context of the performance?

I hope this clears up any issues of print elitism.

i think it's to communicate, but not necessarily the "content" or
message.  a lot of things are being communicated. the winning stuff
is just a gimmick and everyone knows it. it's not the main point.

>And should poetry communicate something at all times -- be it a
>feeling, an idea,
>etc?

well, whether it should or not, i'd suggest that it does. but the
poet is not necessarily in control of what is communicated.


>And is the poem itself the thing, or is it the performance?

here is where i find it hard to separate.  the poem *is* the
performance, in that instance.  that's why i actually often prefer
the terms "poetic activity" or "poetic event" to "poem," as the
latter tends to be (mis)understood as disembodied words on the page
that are then epiphenomenally "brought to life" in a secondary event
by a performer.  in the case of the slam, the performance *is* the
poem, whether or not the poem also has another life on a page.


>
>As for "stand alone", I meant, can it still touch the
>reader or be compelling without being performed?


perhaps, different readers in different ways.  but it is a different poem.

>Or,if it were just read, not performed, would it still carry an effect?

maybe but it'd be a different effect.


>I've always thought that it should.

>
>And my question was then, does slam poetry do this, or does it exist
>best in the context of the performance?

some slam poetry exists only in the moment, some has another life on
a page. different poets, poems and hearers/readers will have
different experiences of these.  it is hard to generalize about "slam
poetry"

Always a treat to read Slamattacks on the Poetics!

Slam continues as the most vibrant grassroots poetry movement in US. I enjoy
the balance of private Gluck as Laureate, reminding us that the Dickinson
model is still appropriate -- while Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Jam on Broadway
prepares to set sail for a tour of Europe this fall, spereading the Gospel
according to Hiphop, Slam, and PerfPo. Sandwiched in the middle: Dana Gioia at the
NEA.

Slam, like Tchaikovsky, is a great way to introduce an art -- Ornette plays
few lullabyes for your infants. Note that one can say Slam w/o a name, because
you do not go to a Slam to see a poet, generally, but to participate in an
event. An intimate poetry reading in 2003, well, most ears so clogged with
rhetoric and commercialspeak that they cannot hear, are bored. How do we enlarge
that audience. A Slam, with its attendant mock-hype and hilarious pep rally for
poetry, hecklingappropriate scene, is a good starting point to demystify
poetry....

Slam is great for high schools and colleges, a forum for getting arts funding
like athletics -- Slam! The (Mock) Olympics of Poetry!

Death of Walter Ong this week saddens. Those who would speak of the
longlasting works of Walt Whitman should check out the griots (jeliya) of West Africa,
whose 800 year old (authorless) "poems" still are central to West African
culture...

And indeed, to hear the African American, Asian, Latino cultures represented
at a slam does bring eyebrow arch to many a "straight" reading...

I think of Def Jam cast poets Beau Sia & Lemon (who blew off the roof w/ his
recitation of "Shine," a classic of African American oral poetry) & Maya del
Valle and Stacey Ann Chin, as using rhyme not in/as scheme but as one tool of
hiphop inflection.

calling slam a "grassroots poetry movement"is like calling Fox "fair and
balanced"
Slam is comercial, very comercial and it is more akin to performance art
than to Poetry.  Sure Def Poetry Jam is going to Europe he has a ton of
money from all the other "art" he does and can finance it.  And then there
is the gospel according to hip hop that has been co-opted by Mr Mathers,
Sean John and company...
