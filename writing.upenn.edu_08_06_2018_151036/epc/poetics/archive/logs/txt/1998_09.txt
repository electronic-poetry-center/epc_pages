I've been writing about the concept of handshaking, which I've taken from
a book by Robin Milner, Communication and Concurrency, on parallel pro-
cessing models, and in it he defines a storage register as a process
instead of an entity - as operations/flows and transformations. I tend to
think of the Net in the same manner, not so much a site or location as
interpenetrating processes and protocols often loosely connected, and
related as well in what is called a "nearly decomposable hierarchy" - in
other words, one can write in a unix editor without worrying about the
operations of the kernel, or write online in Pine without worrying about
the underlying TCP/IP protocols.

Even defining the Net, say, as an accumulation of accessible locations
(addresses and URLs) becomes problematic; there are hidden sites that
hackers use, sites that are only present when the user chooses to make
them so (in both Win95 and linux I have "private" Webpages that I can
present as a server when I'm online), sites behind firewalls, sites that
no longer exist, sites that are connected to other networks that may or
may not be connected to the Net, dynamic IP allocation which in a sense
creates sites on the fly, and so forth. There is also disagreement con-
concerning who is or is not online - the definitions vary.

Approaching this through postmodernist theory helps a great deal, as do
feminisms emphasizing writing on the body, flows, inhabitation.

And all of this really does revolve around the body - the body of the
text, the body of the avatar, sexualizations and desires within and
without both, problems of communication, noise, parasites...

Btw, I think a _lot_ can be wrong with depression, but what some people
are now calling IAD, internet addiction disorder, has other causes - the
Net is a symptom or byproduct in a lot of cases. On the other hand, when
teaching Internet, one finds that students are often disappointed that the
Net is simpler, is relatively harsh, is far too interactive, involves too
much information and too many parameters, etc.

Depression does tend to come upon the more intelligent of the people
(they may see life as it is in some sense).  The study in questiion
would then mean that people learned from their on-line experiences, no?

but your poinnt aboout this as a new "place" is intriguing - there tends
to be no positive feedback.  When I write something as remarkably
perceptive as this, I have to stop expecting to receive 800 "bravos" or
I will get depressed?

Here is a quote from Adorno that typifies the sort of mentality I was
talking about.  He makes the Kant connection himself, only Kant didn't go
far enough in his view:

"The precondition for the autonomy of artistic experience is the
abandonment of the attitude of tasting and savouring.  The trajectory
leading to aesthetic autonomy passes through the stage of
disinterestedness; and well it should, for it was during this stage that
art emancipated itself from cuisine and pornography, an emancipation that
has become irrevocable.  However, art does not come to rest in
disinterestedness.  It moves on.  And in so doing it reproduces, in
different form, the interest inherent in disinterestedness.  In a false
world all_ hedone_ is false.  This goes for artistic pleasure, too.  Art
renounces happiness for the sake of happiness, thus enabling desire to
survive in art."

Contrast this with Bourdieu's critique of Kant in "A Vulgar Critique of
Pure Aesthetics" in _Distinctions_ and O'Hara's "Too many poets act like a
middle-aged mother trying to get her kids to eat too much cooked meat... I
don't give a damn whether they eat or not..."

As I understand it, Lacan's metaphor and metonymy correspond to Freud's
condensation and displacement.  Lacan maps Jakobson's bi-polar terms onto
Freud's analysis of dream symbolism.

The report I read indicated that depressed people were less likely to
resort to the internet.  Depression was measured by self-descriptive suvey
questions.

Not defending the study, just saying it avoided the obvious traps.

I'm not well-read in art philosophy but I always liked Aristotle's
framework of ethos/pathos/logos - or values/emotion/reason - being
fused in poetry.  Seems to me art doesn't renounce anything - it
just contains MORE of these elements than entertainment ("cuisine &
pornography" in Adorno's pretentious phrase) does. The "precondition for
artistic autonomy" is simply the artist's consciousness of his or her
power to MAKE free art in the first place : rather than conforming to a
particular imitation of an imitation or an audience's expectations.

hey folks, back in chicago after a rejuvenating journey west... did some
nice hiking in utah/idaho/wyoming/colorado/south dakota, and managed to
connect with several on this list... was a great month away, in all...

i'm skeptical of all "net causes depression" claims, not b/c the net
doesn't "cause" depression, but b/c i can't help but wonder what the
implications might be for other media (tv, radio, etc.), and what the
significance of the study might be in the context of these other media,
esp. with even a minor nod in the direction of the development of these
other media... i would think, that is, that it would be nigh impossible to
bracket internet time as a thing-in-itself... and that constructing such
research around the issue of whether the net "causes" depression or
happiness (?) or just complacency might already be a bit overdetermined...
but then i'd hate to sound as though all such attempts at social science
research are of necessity w/o value... it's good to keep in mind, though,
that the phenomenon under investigation is, let's see, about five years old
in terms of a wide demographic (in the u.s.)...

in any case what prompts me to post---as to the question of place:  i don't
believe it's resolved by imagining (or positing) the body as an event
(i.e., in time) marked by its flows, say... even if i do agree (with alan,
judy, others) that it's beneficial to think of the human, of life as a
process...

still, seems to me there's something distinctively... urban? at work in
rendering place in such dynamically human terms, and i find it interesting
that the more pastoral implications of the internet (as i read them) may be
complemented (if i may) by theorizing its permeability, it's
multilayeredness (ugh) as such... i say so in part b/c the constructedness
of the world hits me over the head each time i come *back to* the big city
(and i have a sort of spiritual connection, btw, with the hills of upstate
ny---the east, i mean)... and each time i venture forth into nature (a
different order of constructedness, let's say), i'm struck by the
differences between or among enabling fictions/myths, locale to locale... i
must admit to being less impressed (upon?!) by the flatland i've found
mself caught in lo these last eight years... and i suppose, to leap ahead a
bit, one could look at it all in terms of geology (as some postmodern
thinkers have), and then look at geology too as a (historical) process in
which the living itself is implicated (i.e., categorically)...

but i'm also interested---check that, preoccupied with---this question of
where i'd like to throw down some roots (i use the latter to provoke,
sorry)... lots and lots and lots more has been written on landscape, and i
don't certainly wish to simplify the issue any... but for me, spending time
in front of the terminal has in fact *enhanced* my appreciation of the
differences and similarities at work among urban, suburban, pastoral
"locations," (note those quotes!), between east and west, between your home
or hemisphere or mainframe and mine... and i find in fact that a sixty-mile
drive through the desolate grazing land on rt. 40 west of steamboat springs
("no gas for 60 miles") rather throws into relief the nature [wink] of
"community" too---how it varies, and how folks come to it differently on
the basis of where they hang their hats (ok so you may not wear a hat)...

interesting that dinosaur national monument is located at the edge of those
grazing lands i mention... a nexus of sorts between the prehistoric and the
institutional, and an appropriately severe environment... i am, btw,
beginning to view kent's and david's "bad language" exchange as
accommodating the generally tacit nexus between the grammatical and the
postcolonial...

which various matters i suppose speak a bit to that other thread too---the
one about how community is a constructive way of approaching the creative
process, about the need to interrogate different ways of coming to our
public, poetic selves... true enough, and community is a really nice
concept in getting my students to begin to cope with the hard work of
relating their work to others... and yet there are genres (one i'm
interested in at the moment---screenwriting), which by their very nature
[wink] would seem to make their appeal to the popular somewhat more legible
(i might also have mentioned books intended---outright intended---for the
trades)... which is to say that there is good, even great popular work out
there, and that it sometimes gets there by nodding from the get-go in the
direction of the popular---much as this is a generally lamented feature of
works with more mass appeal (not to conflate "mass" with "popular," mind
you)... which suggests that the burden of thinking through popular
screenwriting, just for example, as a generic activity enmeshed in
considerations of community and career (etc.) is a somewhat different one
than thinking through the poetic variant (and if i haven't lost sight that
this site [wink[ is ostensibly devoted to the latter, nor have i failed to
consider that the "burden" i note is sometimes completely ignored by
writers who achieve a measure of popular success---surely an economic issue
in part)...

i suppose you can take this all to mean that at times i really long for a
wider audience... that at times i really long to entertain that wider
audience... that i generally have a hankering for my eggplant livia, but
that sometimes a good cheeseburger hits the spot, yes? (rhetorical question
addressed to a wider audience---and please to correlate my occasional yen
for ground beef with that vast grazing land, above, and please to interpret
my desire for a wider audience as a quasi-utopian suggestion that making
money might actually result in some public good)...

well so, anyway... just some rambling thoughts... good to be back, to see
all of your voices///

best,

joe

A while ago, I saw information posted about Trevor Joyce & his new book.

Whoever posted that, could you backchannel the info to me?

I'd much appreciate it.

Thanks,

I work for a company that tries to build these online community
"places".  We were all fairly surprised at the results, too.  In fact,
we even have a community for people w/ Depression.  I'm always
struggling with whether we're helping people or enabling them to ignore
their "real" life.  And, in many ways, I see this struggle in the same
way I see the difference between _hearing_ poetry and _reading_ poetry.

I bet if someone did a study around the affects of reading, it would
show that the more people read, the more depressed they'll become.

But, what is this place?  Even here, on the POETICS list.  My place here
is my mail program, the specific folder in which all the POETICS email
gets filtered into, all these little voices speaking out at me.
Sometimes I'm amazed that I can spend my whole work day sitting in front
of my computer doing my work and never once having any real-world
connection with somebody in the office.  It's strange that we can create
a "place" out of our interactions with a monitor and keyboard.  It's
strange that we can create a "place" out of paper and ink.

When is it the individual who creates the space, and when is it a true
community space, created collectively?

"Creative Outlet" message board where they post their poetry...

My only response is that this rings true all the way down the line. One
might quibble about the word "pure" - but basically careerism, concern
with technical aspects, antiquarianism, academicism, don't seem like
weaknesses if the end product justifies their presence in the artist's
life, if they have provided fuel for the production of his oeuvre. Nor do
their opposites. Often what seem to be weaknesses when the poet is messily
alive become strengths once he's safely dead, alive and dead being
variable terms.
Borges was probably being overly dismissive of "careerism" (and only
looking at one small slice of the big picture) when he sneeringly
dismissed Lorca as being nothing but "a professional Andalusian."

It seems to me that the more we attach ourselves to inanimate objects
that give us the ability to create places, a defintion of "real life"
becomes more complex.
You say that creating a place with ink and paper is strange. Why? There
are so many ways to create places--poetics is a place, we've discerned
that. A place is created when my friend in Ketchum, ID and I write letters
to each other pretty stationery. People who call phone sex/phone chat
lines create places (for just $2.99/minute, but...). The cool thing about
creating a place on paper through correspondence is that there is much
more room for all sorts of tangents; but email is cool, too, because it
preserves the continuity of discussion. I don't really know if it is up to
us to judge which place is more "real"--I can't help but do it anyway.
Your face-to-face interactions are only as real as you make them, I
suppose, and maybe that goes for other forms of interaction as well.

Seriously? Because they've created a place with x author and y subject
rather than "real" people? Vladimir Rasputin (no, not *that* one) has a
book of short stories, it's called _Siberia on Fire_, and his parents seem
more "real" to me than my 70% of my colleagues. Don't you get more
depressed when you're surrounded by people who are boring?

Oh, yes, hi there. I'm Shana Skaletsky. I hate these introductions because
I don't know what to say, and I didn't want to post anything here until I
felt I had something to say, and I just don't even know if I have anything

Hope I've got the right thread.
Was there a control group of people spending an equal amount of time in
front of a computer screen but not on the Internet? Perhaps the incidence
of depression wasn't a factor of the Internet as much as of the
electromagntic emanations from the screen. After an hour or so on the
computer I get a headache, whether I'm on the Net or not, and that can be
a bit depressing. It's also depressing to consider what the long-term
effects might turn out to be!

David: Get a filter screen. $40, helps a lot.

The only way I can imagine to do the study that would make sense would be
to assess the mental state of a large pool of non-internet users, large
enough to cancel out demographic factors, and to check back periodically as
some of them for their own reasons begin to use the internet. The control
group would be those who don't, the study groups would be those who use the
internet for different amounts of time daily. By checking back periodically
the evolution in the mental state of different user-groups, and the changes
in the population of those groups, could be quantified. If the group were
large enough even the deficiencies of the testing protocol would be
cancelled out. But the subject population, for the study to be at all
meaningful (i.e, to cancel out the other possible demographic factors in
each sub-group), would have to be enormous. Hard to know who would fund
such a study.

i sometimes feel a mite depressed at the "filters" folks seem to use, on
the poetix list.

my main set of arguments were about attacking/critiquing
commodification..The main pt. re spicer, in fact, was to draw a much
broader analogical argument out of his (admittedly limited and kooky) set
of ideas about how to build poetry community....

quite a few people have picked up on the idea of narrowness and
in-groupness, thus neatly reversing the meaning i intended; my fault no
doubt,...but i recommend a second look at the post...

Imagine if, instead of incomprehensible text strings, your computer
produced error messages in Haiku....

     First snow, then silence.
     This thousand dollar screen dies so
     beautifully.


     With searching comes loss
     and the presence of absence:
     "My novel" not found.


     A file that big?
     It might be very useful.
     But now it is gone.


     The Web site you seek
     cannot be located.
     But endless others exist.


     Chaos reigns within
     Reflect, repent, and reboot.
     Order shall return.


     Aborted effort.
     Close all that you have.
     You ask far too much.


     The Tao that is seen
     is not the true Tao, until
     You bring fresh toner.


     Windows NT crashed.
     I am the Blue Screen of Death.
     No one hears your screams.


     Stay the patient course.
     Of little worth is your ire.
     The network is down.


     A crash reduces
     your expensive computer
     to a simple stone.


     Yesterday it worked.
     Today it is not working.
     Windows is like that.


     Three things are certain:
     Death, taxes, and lost data.
     Guess which has occurred.


     You step in the stream,
     but the water has moved on.
     This page is not here.


     Out of memory.
     We wish to hold the whole sky,
     But we never will.


     Having been erased,
     The document you're seeking
     Must now be retyped.


     Rather than a beep,
     Or a rude error message,
     Only these words: "File not found."


     Serious error.
     All shortcuts have disappeared.
     Screen.  Mind.  Both are blank.

I am now knowing you lengthily enough, Mr. Kent, to offer to you for
wearing on your head the crown of irony, the iron crown. Although, to
telling it truthfully, it only cost 2 and sixpence, so it is a
half-a-crown. Half belongs also to me, the Ideal Reader. (They couldn't get
Real one.) Pass it along that I interrupt with joke, it is from my time
studding in London, developing a sense of humor to protect them where you
live. In addition this is, to heading up our badwriting conferencing, me
for vice.

When you are going "Khartoum," I am hearing "cartoon." Location can be
virtual, but keeped in mind. One must not try explanations else shot for
treasoning. It is self-obvious, or it is death. And that too is only half
of it. The other is caravanserai, with its musical composer, sideshows and
tarts. (I know how hard they work in the bakery! I was one, once, too.) It
is better for our knowledge.  Dr. Kent, in this medium at one and the
struck time, I love you, then I will kill you, then I will have you for
dinner. Bring the wife, too.

Aren't you afraid to be frozen like this, with all your assets?  Don't let
me forget, I have work to do. Not for a moment. You see already since last
time my English is bettering. I hate it for the tongue of supercolonialism
that it is. I could have been born dialecting it, and still hate it. It
reminds us all over of itself. I am not always being an intellectual. My
father shoveled camel-dung, and he left me his shovel. So, I am one with
the working-stiff, as if named Utah Phillips Whalen. I emptied my share of
bedpans into the communal trough, and I am not even leaving in Sebastopolo
when we speak. Trust noone, Mr. Kent.  How hard it is to hang on to your
advance. I was not born to reinvent the will, only to be perverse, I will.
The pure products of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan are schizzy. I drive
Mercedes, but into tunnel. Who has done no less?

I always believed mutual admiration was a society until we met in the sense
of the internet. Brothers (and by this I mean 'Sisters' into the
bargaining), we have our weapons in our own hands. We should use them
anytime, but you first. Beside the direction, where your brother's wife
pedals her stay-in-one-place bicycle, much to admiration by myself, is not
at all "spa" as you are writing but rather "workplace of weights," with
many well-equipped shod yuppies and the two of us. No lolling languidly
about the oasis quafficating sour mineral spring-dribblings for people who
patronize what I am patronizing. We are making our own shoes next year, in
the sweating of such things as foreheads, if you believe that, belief has
novel rental arrangement to circumvent plaster ceiling.

It is good that we write in code, offendi, so that the over-assumed people
may complicate something more sinister than the center of Helen Vendler.I
try out some of you from Book of the Quotations by her Wallace Simpson:
Are there those of you in other civilizations who like us call your local
health food store "Food For Millionaires"? Is the national bird always the
parrot? Is a questionmark shaped that way to best open door of car into
where keys without intent have been remained, or baby? Would you take a
can-openinger to a mosque? Is a hanging-down strip of flypaper there for
the delectation of flies? Is nothing sacred, if Beckett is a saint?

Excuse my excursus into history, this also I am studding when I am getting
even in London. Excuse my impressionness. Not wanting to say "All one," not
wanting to say "Alone." Declining to say "Stephen Spendler." Kent, I crisp
up my style like Bacon, but only in case of reception theory. I bed my
hegemonies. I step out of your character. My hat tilts to the starboard of
language. With my little helpful head, it comes off.  Surprise! I can use
exclamations! You were being warned at all the time.

Kent, to write to you is to lose my accent, like Garcia girl. Only for all
is demonstrating discourse-analyzer, self-indulgence being what it is held
to be. If I can keep it up, it will seem like ours. To me it was hard, but
to her, requiring encourage. It will never be tender, despite what they are
telling re Motel 6. Where did all these children come from? The egg hatched
like a plot of cementary land. He had opportunity, which I took. Now we are
being red herrings with fertilizer plant, spreading that around. In the
U.S.A., Congrats has to declare hostilities. Having not done so, U.S.A. is
not at war, therefore Crude missiles come from elsewhere, Israel is my
favorite scrape-gut. If you are credenceing such, you are credenceing one
god alone and his favorite prophet, Al-bim Franklen. Names are the icecubes
of laughter, and it is hot here. I example.

Mr.Kent, are you decent from Prussian philosphe, he whose promenade
citizens tied their grandfather's hands by? He of the Kentagorical Denial?
He was inherited by one of our Marx brothers, don't you co-terminate, and
if not, why, you may need further study (Karl when your find works).
Eventually, practice make patient, Dr. Kent, and already I am making you
sit too long at the well of mail in the mall of fortune. How I am wishing
to look upon your shining face and grasp your hand till we gasp "Glad to be
making your acquaintance!" I hope clearly that I accept. Yours in the spurt
of communisty, Davood

Dear Poetics:

please reply to this message directly to chax press at chax@theriver.com,
and not to the poetics list.

I'm probably committing a sin of posting to poetics when I actually have
poetics incoming mail stopped, having recently returned from an out-of-town
trip. I will start up again as soon as I catch up with other work -- or
does one ever catch up?

I had to compile a pretty complete list of Chax Press publications recently
for an exhibition, and I thought I'd post it to the list. I've added
prices. As many of you know, we made handprinted and bound books
exclusively here up to 1990, and since then have issued several more,
although not at the rate we once did. You can assume that any book priced
over about $15 on this list is a letterpress, handprinted and bound book.
Some of the works which are listed for less money than that are hybrid
forms, part computer-generated and laser or offset-printed, but with some
aspects of traditional hand book arts employed in the production or
binding. Please ask me if you have other questions. "OP" on this list,
instead of a price, indicates that a book is out of print and unavailable.

I have included two books which are currently being printed and bound, and
these are the first two on the list. I have not included other
"forthcoming" books.

And right now, we've really joined the commercial world, I guess, by
accepting credit card payment. So I'd like to offer anyone from the Poetics
list who orders makes an order of twenty dollars or more (usually that's a
minimum of two books, but three the way some of them add up) and is willing
to pay by credit card, a 20% discount if they make the order during this
coming week. If there's a good response, I will also consider extending
that timeline.

Once again, please reply to this e-mail, or order books, directly either by
emailing me at chax@theriver.com  (and not by emailing the poetics list) or
by phoning 520-620-1626. If you want to order by credit card and take
advantage of the discount, either include your credit card number and
expiration date in your email, or phone it in. As an alternative, you can
send a fax with appropriate information to 520-620-1636. We will generally
add a $2 to $5 shipping/handling charge to orders of 1 to 10 books,
depending on the weight. If you order more than 10 and will accept "book
rate" shipping, we will waive the shipping/handling charges.

We've had a summer here with a couple of computer glitches and one crash,
and I've been trying to catch up on all previous book orders, some of which
got hurt by the computer problems. So, if you think we owe you a book or
two or three, please let me know that, too.

Thank you, and here's the list:

Oops. As long as I'm at it could Valerie Fox Backchannel me. It's been
an interesting start of the week here including the visit of a writer
friend from NYC (see below..

CHICAGO (Reuters) - 'Titanic' videos fly off store shelves. The most
successful movie ever, seemed on its way Tuesday to becoming the most
successful home video ever, as "Titanic" fans across the United States
stayed up late and waited in line to be among the first owners of the
video. "Titanic" videos went on sale at 12:01a.m. in each time zone
across the U.S. and indications from early sales suggested "Titanic"
could top Walt Disney Co.'s "The Lion King," which reportedly sold
around 30 million copies, as the best- selling home video ever. "It's
really going well," said Bob Gerhinger, Blockbuster Video's marketing
manager for the Northeast. "It's exceeding all my expectations for
people showing up."

COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - A  riot started outside a Blockbuster video
store as a result of demonstrators who were against the sale of home
video copies of "Titanic". A police spokesman said a large group of
people blocked the entrance to the store and were screaming chants and
songs against the movies mis-representation of history. Shortly before
the store was re-opened at 12:01a.m. to sell the video, the group
started burning copies of a large assortment of books they had brought
to the scene, including Joseph Conrad's "Twix Land and Sea." The police,
who are still investigating this matter, said "it seems impossible that
there would be a group of over thirty people outside the store igniting
books without a single bystander providing a lead to the perpetrators."
Nothing is known about what the group was trying to accomplish.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Has it come to this? A San Francisco man was
hospitalized early Tuesday after an assailant pummeled him to the
ground, kicked his head, and attempted to steal his new video copy of
the movie blockbuster "Titanic." A police spokesman said the two men,
who apparently knew each other, were both at a Blockbuster video store
on the first night that "Titanic" went on sale. "The assailant punched
and kicked the victim, then took the video tape," the spokesman. The
19-year-old victim was treated for an eye injury, while the assailant,
aged 22, was arrested and could be charged with aggravated assault, the
police spokesman said. "It looks like the Titanic video was secondary in
this incident," he said. "Thank goodness - if it was the primary cause
we'd all be in big trouble."

Chain 5: different languages.
6 x 9; 302 pages

This issue presents work that is written in more than one language. Some
of the writers and artists represented here use different languages
daily, some use them on a less regular basis, some use them to survive,
some use them in the leisure of the classroom, and some use them knowing
only their sounds. Regardless, we have read the move to write in more
than one language as political, as a move that questions monolingualism
and other homogenizing language controls. This issue argues that an
aesthetic space that acknowledges the difficulties of communication and
respects these difficulties can be an antidote to social spaces that
demand “English first.”

Anne Waldman has called Chain “one of the best ‘outrider’ magazines, a
true cultural intervention.” Since 1993, Chain has been publishing a
yearly issue of work gathered loosely around a special topic. The
special topic allows us to switch the editorial question that we ask
each piece of work submitted from “is this a great piece of art” to
“does this piece of art tell us something about the topic that we didn’t
otherwise know.” This makes Chain a little rougher around the edges, a
little less aesthetically predictable. Within the frame of the special
topic, we tend to privilege mixed media and collaborative work and work
by emerging or younger artists. Please check out our website at
http://www2.hawaii.edu/~spahr/chain for more back issue information and
calls for work for forthcoming issues.

Might suggest Diane Beddoes  " Deleuze, Kant and Indifference". Different than
disinterest, though, I guess.

"Dequincey's admirable text _The Last Days of Immanuel Kant_  said everything,
but only the reverse side of things that will find their full development in
the four poetic formulas of Kantianism. This is the Shakespearean aspect of
Kant, who begins as Hamlet and winds up as Lear, whose daughters would be the
post Kantians."

Philosophy."

Kant is our tableaux (like marx) in our Clinton/Yeltzin (rock&roll in the free
world) times, in trying, to determine, whether to annunciate or renunciate the
beautiful (much less the true) (to say nothing of happiness).

So it may be easier to believe in our Masoch contractualism. Fine print
pleasure. But I don't know.

        Well Children it looks like some of those bad boys think that
getting rid of Eliot and 'dusting him' and 'recontextualizing his work' in
some so called counter-tradition is going to get him some prestige in
certain circles of leftist type of would be readers and or even would be
poets of a certain ilk that fancies themselves poets and even lovers of
language. well, we all know now, don't we,  that  poetry changes nothing
and that being a right wing christian automatically excludes one from
being a poet in that nasty so-called counter tradition. And some folks
feel real strongthat if ya ask a question, well geez, well Lord knows you
can't possibly be asking a valid question.Well, we know that if the
editorshad said,, we wanted to publish a poem by the Possum, but the big bad
publisher's can't afford it, well, geez, then we know that they would have
gained the  credibility of their ordinary readers and then the sympathy
would have flowed totheir cause. But as it stands, we all know that hatred
and resentment and jealousy and envy at the heart beat of so many bad
readers and especially the left who never seem to be able to figure things
out without wanting to put down a person now, do they? or dont
they?afterall theyhate Possum so much just he was so successful and
they're not and never ever going to be. And you think of poets like Hart
Crane who spent just years trying to get out from under that Angel that
Anxiety the Possum seemed to cause him. But Allan Tate and Berryman and
others they did fine, and did not have to call him names. Like the lefty
types do oh Dear!!! Well, you know weak poets abound in every time, and so
do weak readers oh dear!! Well they are so mixed up with their american
idea of peotry as democracy and Eliot was just not like that and Neither
was Joyce or old Ez. I remember when he came to see your mother and he the
Possum just sat there reciting ream after ream of poetry by Auden, and
Thomas and Joyce and Yeats and so many others, so many, so many. Ah! the
room it just vibrated!! I remember yer mother she ran in the other room,
and went found some of them there pomes from her youth by that French poet
and Mister Eliot well, he just sat there with tears inhis eyes. And then
he did some by Herbert, and Donne and he read us a passage of Djuna Barnes
who yer aunt  had known in Paris when she was working in the fashion
business. and I remember when he bought our first copy of Prufrock and
Other Poems. I was so thrilled. Well, you see I just dont get this stuff
by the newer poets, they seem so bored and resentful.Ah, but William hewas
never bored, but he was jealousof old Possum and Ezra.
And you know, like some, they think CD is a professor, but that aint the
case, CD is just a reader who lost her head like Orpheus did over reading
too much poetry rightor wrong, left or right, and just being a poor Irish
Jewish girl well shejust has such Passion from so many restless and
lonesome nights of sitting up with the poetry and the words, so whyshould
she be a he? when there is no poetry likethe word which vibrates through
memory and desire. Well if anyone ever memorized a poem, it would not be
the Waste Land now would it? It sure as tarnation hell would not be a poem
by a rambling shuffling sufi american poet who only went from one book to
another complaing and hating about the sorrows ofhis people and expecting
others tounderstand them. Shall I dare to eat a spoon and spit the dead
words of the counter-tradition up your asshole and make you eat them from
assuming something about a stranger, and all them elitists making eyes to
kill your voice and love of poetry and poets dead and alive. alive like
the dead and dead like the alive. Ah! but you see, dear, even here they
hate the gender which speaks a lingo unlike their own, and they cannot
help it, half of them are losers who will be forgotten in the night of the
darkness coming at them soon. Ah, yes of course they were good poems in
that silly book, but then what happened to Jack Spicer, and what happened
to so many others, et tant d'autres et tant d'autres. We dont know do we,
we never shall until we are dead. Well I dont suppose  Derek Walcott cares
to have his verse besides mister ginsberg's whose ear for rhyme was a
carpenter's dream, inother words flat flat flat. Oh well, what can ya do?
Eat your heart  out and go back to Villon, if I find oneof their poets
that can move me as much as Miriam Waddington or Dorothy Livesay, well
then I will rush to their books like a fish rushing upstream. But I doubt
that day will come, because I think they are burnt out, and that their
ideas are so old fashioned they cant see the trees  for the forest.
Poetry, such a  hard art, and so long to gain, and life being so short.

Adorno also writes however: "The bourgeois want art voluptuous and life

I don't know that this is a significant qualification at all. Can my life
be voluptuous if I deny myself artistic pleasure?  Where does life end
and art begin?  Is not aesthetic asceticism itself "bourgeois"? It
certainly doesn't come from any other social class known to me.

Did Adorno really want life "voluptuous"?  In which case how can he say
"in a false world all hedone [i.e. pleasure] is suspect." I suspect that
for the sake of a clever chiasmus he asserts something that he doesn't
really mean to say.

A TRUE ACCOUNT OF TALKING MY ROOMMATE INTO BELIEVING
I'D SAID ANYTHING RELEVANT ABOUT HIS WORK WHATSOEVER

I told Chris to get over it
& put on his shirt, "Obviously,
we need more cigarettes, since
none of these women are calling
us back, what the fuck, why
even bother writing all these poems
in the first place? It took me
_two days_ to get this one to look
like an octopus, look at it!
it's beautiful! and she won't even
kiss me anymore, let alone
leave her husband!"
                     "Yeah, well, Mark Wallace
wrote the most relevant post in this
whole--"
        "Wallace?!?" I shrieked. We bounded
down four flights of stairs, "I don't know,"
I said, "he has a point, but it isn't
mine." Brooklyn. I pointed at the moon.
                                                     "All you
did, Gary, was juxtapose my poems
with ones I'd told you were important
to me. It's not like you did a close reading
of them."
        "That wasn't the point, didn't
you get the connections I was making?"
                                                           "No,
but you can't read anything on e-mail, and
besides, it's not like those poems influenced
the ones you referred to."
                               "It doesn't
matter," I said, "that was my whole point.
Everything influences you all the time, like
even if you're focusing on one thing,
everything else is resident there."
                                        "We should
look for a new chair," Chris said, reminding me
it was garbage night, "everything I own is breaking
down, I'm breaking down." He coughed,
dramatically.
                   We turned the corner onto 7th Ave.
At that moment I remembered that someone had
e-mailed me earlier to tell me a poem
I'd written was "indulgent." Yeah? You
live in a shithole & try to get excited about
"paring down." Jack Smith became more extravagant,
more indulgent, the worse his
living conditions. I could connect this up to Chris's
poems, easy. What's a non sequitur (his
poems are filled with them) if not the manifestation
of capitalist frustration? Like, "Look,
here's everything, you can have none of it."
The non-sequitur gives you everything,
while taking it all away. The non-sequitur
is very American.
                 "Nobody's gonna give a shit
about what you say anyway cuz you're my
roommate."
               "Poetry is failure, Chris, we're all
failures, & beautifully so." Even after
saying it, I didn't believe it. I realized
at that moment there wasn't anything I really
believed in. I liked how the streetlights
looked, and realized I liked them because there
was no way to describe them. Accurately.
They burned coldly, above the street. So what? We
all do.
______________________________________

NOTES FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION: Under whose influence was this poem most likely
written: Frank O'Hara, Amy Gerstler, Petronius, Sharon Mesmer, Blaise Cendrars,
Michael Lally, Eileen Myles, Villon, Chris Stroffolino, Jordan Davis, Ovid,
David Trinidad, Gerald Burns, Ange Mlinko, Mayakovsky, Charles Bukowski or
Kenneth Koch? The poem does not seem to answer to, directly, Jacques Debrot's
challenge to "uncover" in Stroffolino's work the influence of Dylan,
Shakespeare, etc. Is the poet "making a statement" in his refusal to operate
within the specific terms of this particular discourse and reading, or is he
simply "avoiding the tough work because he's lazy from too much dairy,
cigarettes and beer"? Do you find people "burn coldly" on e-mail? Why would
anyone write a poem in the shape of an octopus? If the poet had put, say, a
lemur on the sidewalk beneath the streetlight, would you have paid closer
attention to the poem? If it can be said that Paul Eulard gives you a world
only to take it away, piece by piece, is Chris Stroffolino Michael Palmer's
distant cousin? Debrot has been oddly silent the last day or two. Does this
speak of his tacit agreement with, or refusal to operate within, the terms of
the present writer? Or simply ennui? Why hasn't the present writer brought up
James Tate yet? Is he uncomfortable around goatees? Why hasn't he brought up
Brautigan? Isn't the act of hyper-extended metaphor (another feature of
Stroffolino's work) "Brautiganesque"? Or is this something "one finds" in
Shakespeare? Why hasn't he yet quoted Stroffolino's "I wish I could control
where my shit goes/ but the things that pass through me were never mine"?
Wouldn't that have said everything he's said so far, but more succinctly, &
direct from the horse's mouth?

THE IMPORTANT ISSUE IS:

when you dream a long complicated dream in which you are being kicked in
the head by an ornery mule in Wisconsin before meeting the whole extended
family and you suddenly wake up after bumping your noggin on the corner
of the bedframe - was the mule-kick/headbump the origin of the dream
narrative or its denouement?

are we awake yet?

"The Story of my Life"

Bored with my prose style I vacationed in Tahiti.
The women were not what I expected; no sympathy was demanded of me.

I vacationed in Tahiti, regretting only that fine dust in my nostrils.
No sympathy was demanded of me--happily, since I had none to give.

Regretting only that fine dust in my nostrils I lived among the dead,
happily.  Since I had none to give, I wasn't worried about the blood
supply.

I  lived among the dead leaves of Autumn.  Unaware of the venom,
I wasn't worried about the blood supply, not even about those

leaves of Autumn, unaware of the venom in my recalcitrant heart!
Not even about those wise enough to invest every cent

in my recalcitrant heart!  She might have warned me that she was
to invest every cent in such inimitable resorts.

She might have warned me that she was bored with my prose style!
In such inimitable resorts the women were not what I expected.


Probable influences on this poem:  Gaugin, Heidegger, Ashbery, Rimbaud,
San Juan de la Cruz, Gilbert Sorrentino, Juan Ramon Jimenez, Jerome
Rothenberg, Celan, "Rene" Rilke, Pasolini, Cavafy, Judith Butler, Antoni
Tapies, Jacques Derriere, Eric Dolphy, Andre Gide, Basho Matsuo, Marianne
Moore, Pere Gimferrer, Pierre Reverdy, Bill Berkson, Francis Scott O'Hara,
Luisa Castro, Juan Goytisolo, Theodor Adorno, Borges, Jose Lezama Lima,

St. Augustine, Leonard Elmore, Li Po, Gary Snyder, Char, Ponge, Ramon
Gomez de la Serna, Emily Dickinson, Virginia Wooolf, Horace, Mallarme...
(partial list)


But of course if I was really influenced by all these people  I would be
a) a better poet   OR
b) even MORE derivative...

*** Man beaten in 'Titanic' video robbery attempt

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Has it come to this? A San Francisco man
was hospitalized early Tuesday after an assailant pummeled him to the
ground, kicked his head, and attempted to steal his new video copy of
the movie blockbuster "Titanic." A police spokesman said the two men,
who apparently knew each other, were both at a Blockbuster video
store on the first night that "Titanic" went on sale. "The assailant
punched and kicked the victim, then took the video tape," the
spokesman. The 19-year-old victim was treated for an eye injury,
while the assailant, aged 22, was arrested and could be charged with
aggravated assault, the police spokesman said. "It looks like the
Titanic video was secondary in this incident," he said. "Thank
goodness - if it was the primary cause we'd all be in big trouble."

Hi Anselm,

I don't think Ishmael has E-mail... I've asked her for her address many
times. If you'd like her mailing address (it's changed since the last time
I gave it to you), tell me... I'll call it up.

CENSORSHIP AND ATTACK ON MAIL ART IN CHILE

In response of the systematic and offensive political persecution =
and
the intolerance that for various years have been going on at the =
University
of Chile's Fine Art School (actions promoted and spurred by =
reactionary,
totalitarian an pro Pinochet sectors) on March 98, the Mail Art =
Exhibit
"Stop: liberty, diversity and pluralism" was held at the Santiago's
Museum of Contemporary Art, in defense of the constant attacks by =
sectors
in power. As a result, Humberto Nilo, the Director of the U. de =
Chile's
Fine Art School and organizer of the event, was dismissed from his =
position
along with the Museum's Director and the Curator of the exhibit: =
Mrs. Rosario
Letelier and Mr. Ernesto Munioz.

The brillant track records of the dismissed wich includes their =
strong
defense of Human Rights during the chilean dictatorship; =
recuperating
Guillermo
Deisler memoirs, and hundreds of other artistic manifestation in =
defense
of Human Rights and the dissemination of the best in Contemporary =
Art,
were not taken into account.

It is paradoxical, not to mention denigrating, that after 17 years =
of
military dictatorship in Chile, and after reaching (as certain =
oficialist
sectors proclaim)  democratic and social harmony levels worthy of =
being
emulated by the rest of the continent; we have to experience the =
sad spectacle
in wich cultural spaces are closed through economic strangulation, =
harrassment
and dismissal of distinguished artists, simply because they don't =
share
the "official line" and open or covert censorship of critical =
manifestations
on what's established and current.

These cases, are not only attacks on people of proven professional =
and
artistic excellence, they constitute a frontal attack on the =
principles
that ground culture, in addition to being a crass outrage on the =
libertarian
aspirations of an broad sector of the national and international =
artistic
community. It is time we sponsor and stimulate the global coscience =
among
all those artists who believe on the diversity and pluralism in =
art, to
confront outrages such as that have just taken place in Chile. It =
has to
be done now, since with the sophisticated strategies for =
manipulation and
control, in the hands of the new inquisitioners of culture... =
tomorrow
could be too late!

The intolerance and desdain for cultural diversity are achieving =
strategic
permanence in those places that have historically been destinated =
to
protecting
diversity. Perhaps that's why there's been a strong push to silence =
them.
What about critical view and reflection? Or is it that we are =
facing the
beginning of a world regime with a cultural policy that is =
predominently
non-critical, blind and "light" aligned with the purposes of =
Neo-liberalism?

Faced with the fear that the arrogance and brutality of the chilean
regime could put in peril the future of Humberto Nilo, Rosario =
Letelier

Dear Listees:

This semester, I'll teach a course called Introduction to Poetry at my
college, and I've created a web page -- my first --for my students. I
haven't registered it yet with any search engines; I'd like some
feedback first, if you feel so inclined. For example, I'd like to know
if anyone has problems reading any of the sections of the page; if so,
which sections? What browser do you use? What size screen? What
appearance settings/video controller? And beyond the technical matters,
what do you think of the approach?

You can check it out at:

Thanks,

Listees:

Recently finished Don Byrd's provocative THE POETICS OF COMMON KNOWLEDGE in
which he contends that most contemporary poetry is irrelevant because it has
failed to address information theory (which was only meant to be used for
computer engineering, if I'm not mistaken.  I was wondering if I've missed any
serious conversation or reviews on the book.  If anyone has any response to
the book, I'd like to hear from them.  I never felt that "common knowledge"
was particularly well defined in the book, but was intrigued by the idea of
"information" replacing the role of "substance" in traditional philosophy.
Also not clear to me was what Byrd thought the effect of
information/communication theory should be on contemporary poetry.  Reminded
me faintly of Fish's essay on speech acts in IS THERE A TEXT IN THIS CLASS?
which Fish says in most interesting because he chose a text that is directly
concerned with "speech acts".  The impact of such explorations on other texts
seems relatively uncertain.

One of the more confusing ideas in the book is just exactly how "interest"
(which he opposes to "interpretation") creates meaning.

Is it anyone else's opinion that the book merely raises questions or did I
miss something?

Thanks

I may show up at the RIBOT conference with a picket sign, because I,
as someone born in 67, seem to be stuck between generational
identifiers.

"Over 60 Under 30 (poets & visual artists from around the world, born
before 1938 after 1968)"

What is the purpose of organizing groups of writers based on age? The
obvious missing links are always in the wrong place and the list of
exceptions is longer than the likenesses exhibited by those of the
same "generation"

as Armand Schwerner once said, it seems that there is a turnover in
poetry generations about every five years or so.

It makes sense, I think, to identify poets of a particular place and
time, or even of a specific time and no particular place. Or a
particular place at any time.

If we could narrow it to that, we could get pretty "exclusive" and
that would allow us to say somethings. I have been reading Bill
Luoma's book WORKS & DAYS and which is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED reading not
only for its poetic "on-base percentage" but for what Eileen Myles
describes in one of the best blurbs ever, as the "...expressing being
alive in groups..." which is crucial, I think, for an understanding of
what such group designations can mean. And he writes about San Diego
in the 80s and New York in the 90s and it has meaning for me, even
though I wasn't there.

Anyhow- Bill's terms of the literary community, which involve personal
mythologies born out of creative isolationism, transcend literary
posturing. Or so it seems to me. Havign left Buffalo, I see how highly
bureaucratic that lifestyle is/was, how it already presupposes the
kinds of community that develop in spite of it. And there is community
there, inspite of the fact that the community would be there even if
the people werent...

And that's my terribly blathering point, that what is the point of
such generational designations. What is it that people are trying to
learn about themselves that they need to be marketed in that "rent a
beatnik" kind of way. What formal or social concerns determine how
these groups get constituted. Obviously, if you live in New york,
these questions are easier to answer. "We're the group that met at
that bar every week." "We're the group the met at the church" etc.
etc.

but what does that mean?

Dear friends:
                    I am transmitting you this serious accusation of
attack
and censorship to the art and, in particular, to the mail art. The
success
of the campaign depends on you, it is say, it depend on the diffusion
that
you could give you to the communication (including thw wegsites) and of
the
expressions of rejection that you transmit to the addresses indicated to
the end. Fraternal greetings.

Estimado amigos:
                           Estoy trasmitiendo a Uds. esta grave
acusación
de ataque y censura al arte y, en particular, al arte correo. El éxito
de
la campaña depende de Uds., es decir, depende de la difusión que Uds. le
puedan dar al comunicado (incluyendo las páginas de internet) y de las
expresiones de rechazo que Uds. trasmitan a las direcciones indicadas
abajo. Saludos fraternos:

CENSORSHIP AND ATTACK ON MAIL ART IN CHILE

In response of the systematic and offensive political persecution and
the intolerance that for various years have been going on at the
University
of Chile's Fine Art School (actions promoted and spurred by reactionary,
totalitarian an pro Pinochet sectors) on March 98, the Mail Art Exhibit
"Stop: liberty, diversity and pluralism" was held at the Santiago's
Museum of Contemporary Art, in defense of the constant attacks by
sectors
in power. As a result, Humberto Nilo, the Director of the U. de Chile's
Fine Art School and organizer of the event, was dismissed from his
position
along with the Museum's Director and the Curator of the exhibit: Mrs.
Rosario
Letelier and Mr. Ernesto Munioz.

The brillant track records of the dismissed wich includes their strong
defense of Human Rights during the chilean dictatorship; recuperating
Guillermo
Deisler memoirs, and hundreds of other artistic manifestation in defense
of Human Rights and the dissemination of the best in Contemporary Art,
were not taken into account.

It is paradoxical, not to mention denigrating, that after 17 years of
military dictatorship in Chile, and after reaching (as certain
oficialist
sectors proclaim)  democratic and social harmony levels worthy of being
emulated by the rest of the continent; we have to experience the sad
spectacle
in wich cultural spaces are closed through economic strangulation,
harrassment
and dismissal of distinguished artists, simply because they don't share
the "official line" and open or covert censorship of critical
manifestations
on what's established and current.

These cases, are not only attacks on people of proven professional and
artistic excellence, they constitute a frontal attack on the principles
that ground culture, in addition to being a crass outrage on the
libertarian
aspirations of an broad sector of the national and international
artistic
community. It is time we sponsor and stimulate the global coscience
among
all those artists who believe on the diversity and pluralism in art, to
confront outrages such as that have just taken place in Chile. It has to
be done now, since with the sophisticated strategies for manipulation
and
control, in the hands of the new inquisitioners of culture... tomorrow
could be too late!

The intolerance and desdain for cultural diversity are achieving
strategic
permanence in those places that have historically been destinated to
protecting
diversity. Perhaps that's why there's been a strong push to silence
them.
What about critical view and reflection? Or is it that we are facing the
beginning of a world regime with a cultural policy that is predominently
non-critical, blind and "light" aligned with the purposes of
Neo-liberalism?

Faced with the fear that the arrogance and brutality of the chilean
regime could put in peril the future of Humberto Nilo, Rosario Letelier
and Ernesto Munioz, we begin this World Campaign to repudiate censorship
and personal attacks against any artist, regardless of whether he
practices
Mail Art, anywhere on the face of the Earth, requesting from everyone to
send-in expressions of solidarity and rejection against all sorts of
discriminatory
policies on cultural matters, so that in some way, their offenders can't
get away with their threats unscathed.


CENSURA Y ATAQUE AL ARTE CORREO EN CHILE

A raíz de las sistemáticas y ofensivas persecuciones
políticas e intolerancia que por varios años se dan en la
Facultad de Artes de la Universidad de Chile -acciones promovidas e
incitadas
por sectores reaccionarios, totalitaristas y Pinochetistas- se convocó
y realizó el pasado marzo de 1998, la exposición de arte
correo "STOP: libertad, diversidad y pluralismo", en defensa
de los constantes ataques de estos sectores de poder, en el Museo de
Arte
Contemporáneo de Santiago. Como resultado de la misma, el Director
de la Escuela de Bellas Artes de la Universidad de Chile, Humberto
Nilo, organizador de la muestra, no sólo fue expulsado de su cargo,
sino también, el Director y Curador del Museo que albergó
la exposición la Sra. Rosario Letelier y el Sr. Ernesto Muñoz.

De nada sirvieron las brillantes trayectorias de los expulsados ni su
férrea defensa de los derechos humanos durante la dictadura chilena,
incluyendo la recuperación de la memoria de Guillermo Deisler, el
eterno exiliado, y cientos de otras manifestaciones artísticas en
defensa de los derechos humanos y la difusión de lo mejor del arte
contemporáneo.

Resulta paradójico, por no decir denigrante, que después
de 17 años de dictadura militar en Chile, y habiendo alcanzado -según
lo pregonan ciertos sectores oficialistas- unos niveles de democracia y
convivencia social dignos de emular en el resto del continente; tengamos
que asistir al triste espectáculo de cierre de espacios culturales
a través del estrangulamiento económico, el hostigamiento
y despido de sus empleos de destacados artistas por no compartir con la
línea oficial y la censura abierta o solapada de toda manifestación
crítica sobre lo establecido y lo vigente.

Estos casos no son sólo ataques a personas de probada excelencia
profesional y artística, sino más bien constituyen un ataque
frontal a los principios que cimientan la cultura, además de un
craso atropello a las aspiraciones libertarias de un amplio sector de la
comunidad artística tanto nacional como internacional. Es hora de
fomentar e incentivar la conciencia mundial entre todos aquellos
artistas
que creemos en la diversidad y pluralidad del arte, para hacerle frente
a atropellos como el que acaba de ocurrir en Chile. Y tiene que ser
ahora,
ya que con las sofisticadas estrategias de manipulación y control
en manos de los nuevos inquisidores de la cultura... ¡mañana
podría resultar demasiado tarde!

La intolerancia y el desprecio por la diversidad cultural están
entronizándose justamente en aquellos lugares destinados históricamente
a ser la salvaguarda de esa diversidad. Quizás por eso mismo es
que se despliega un ahínco feroz y mordaz para silenciarlos. ¿Y
la visión crítica y la reflexión? ¿O es que
estamos ante los inicios de un régimen mundial con una política
cultural predominantemente acrítica, ciega y "light"
afin con los propósitos del neoliberalismo?

Ante el temor de que los desplantes y la brutalidad del régimen
chileno puedan poner en peligro la suerte de Humberto Nilo, Rosario
Letelier
y Ernesto Muñoz, se inicia esta campaña mundial de repudio
a la censura y al ataque personal contra cualquier artista, practique o
no el arte correo, en cualquier lugar del planeta, solicitando al mundo
entero que envíen expresiones de apoyo solidario y rechazo frontal
hacia todo tipo de política discriminatoria en materia cultural,
para que de alguna manera, sus ofensores no puedan llevar a cabo sus
amenazas
impunemente.

This book of Don Byrd's has always seemed woefully under-discussed to
me, though Joe Amato and others here on Poetics cite from it regularly
(see the opening chapter in Joe's _Bookends_ and elsewhere).

By way of initial response, it seems important to underscore that DB's
"information theory" is not limited to the academic phenomenon of that
name during the late 1940s and 1950s (though Don's explication of the
foundational texts and thinkers from this period is certainly the most
subtle I've seen from a non-specialist). But for the broader
implications of "information theory" and "statistical reality," see the
passage begining on page 330, "Only those disciplines that study culture
have been largely untouched by the cognitive science." And so forth.

Frankly, I think Paul Vangelisti may be the most gifted editor of our time.
Bringing together writers under 30 & over 60 strikes me as a *brilliant
thought experiment*.  Joel Kuszai is completely right about the arbitrariness
of generational identifiers -- but, as Cage & MacLow demonstrate, the
arbitrary can, under certain conditions/controls, be extraordinarily
compelling.

I like the idea of the arbitrary as an editing principle. How about a
conference/anthology of poets born on Sunday? Poets with an n as the third
letter of their first names? poets with vestigial nipples? poets whose
mothers had brown eyes? Poets born in towns and cities with no public
transportation? Poets who play the slots? Poets with wheelbarrows in their
sheds? Poets with gardens of phallic vegetables? Poets who often forget to
button at least one button of their 501s? Poets who don't use sunscreen?
Don't get me started. There's no end of brilliant possibilities.

DUBLIN, Sept 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Bill Clinton has
been given a 250-to-one chance of shooting a hole-in-one when he
completes his whirlwind tour of Ireland with a visit to golfing
mecca Ballybunion on Saturday.
            And Paddy Power, Ireland's leading bookmaker, on Friday
predicted Clinton would prove too weak for the three Irish
golfing addicts who will accompany him, giving him the poorest
chance of winning at eight-to-one.
            Club captain Brian McCarthy was expected to win ahead of
Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy and former foreign minister
Dick Spring, who will partner Clinton.

Dick Spring? No....

But Mark, what your examples fail to account for is that the arbitrariness of
-30 +60 is not self-evident as are the examples you give.  Vangelisti's
juxtaposition is interesting both for what it might & might not disclose -- it
might perhaps prove Kuszai's contention, not through assertion, but
dramatically; or it may not deconstruct generational markers at all;  in any
case the particular inventiveness of V's idea is that he combines the
traditionalist idea of anthology (+60) with the insurgent (-30).
Unfortunately I myself  don't qualify on either count, but then, I never felt
I needed to be published in every issue of every magazine I ever liked.

Dear David:

1. [initial digression: On my youthdy]

Ah, werey youy in your youthdy an Englished bakkery and a stuudy?
Bloody goody for youy, old chappy. I mostly proudly in my owny
youthdy (for whaty it's worthy to youy, whichy I am startting to
thinky may not be muchy), was a freighty-car mechanicy and a memmber
of thee Hegel Upside Down Internationalist Brigade. This lasty was in
Nicaraguay, for thee bulky of '83. In thee HUDIB --or BIHAR in
Spanishy-- therey werey thirty oddy irony-lovingg poetys withy sorey
necksys and numerosy ex-gigolosys from Argentiny to Tanzany. We atey
monkesys and bugsys, took runny shiitys on flesh-eatings planteys,
jackedd-offy in thee presencesy of thee cockatoosy, skirted aroundy
Coontra paatrolsys every timey we coulddy, wroted poemseys about poor
peoples in thee moony, and fromy our hammoocks strungy betweenn guava
trreeseys, played a cut-throat gamey calledd Thee German Ideology. It
was all quite romanticy, quaintly funnys, and oftened violenty!!!

Aren't you impressedy?


2. [hats off!]

I think you are a marvelous poet. And I think you are marvelously
witty. And I mean that, really and really.


3. [four serious questions]

Yet now may I ask you four serious questions, placing a question
mark after each.

a) David, do you remember that I asked you, in a most friendly way,
if you would go for a ride with me?

b) David, is that long and throbbing thing which dangles from your
bellybutton a nerve?

c) David, do old English studs always have such prominent and anxious
bulge in bell-bottoms?

d) David, could you please move back just a little bit on this camel
whose name is Araby? (question mark shaped like shepherd's hook)


4. [dresden]

Dresden, as it burned, they say, was beautiful from the Vickers
[sic?]. Thousands of fires gathering in whooshes to become a single
consuming one!

I lay the aerial photo of your Khartoum location post flat on the
floor, make motor-sounds, spread out my arms, bank, and see.


5. [see what?]

Oh, see in horror what has become of my spired and melodious
city! For in the shock of it, it all comes into view, as if I could
see, with suddenness, in all directions and simultaneously!


6. [have you ever been to a flamenco bar?]

Not at all to interrupt as an obvious joke, but have you ever been to
a flamenco bar?


 7. [the phenomena of my comeuppance, or: "so it goes: a bedtime
story for my niece"]

Oh, little crown of iron forged to likeness of a doctor's face,
what are you doing in this circle of flaming studs and bakers?

And little burnt dinner all set to be eaten
(and crispy Frau so kindly invited to lick boot to boot),
what are you doing near this shovel for dung-digging,
hissing like ice-cubes in ruins of little museum?

And little shell of bank on which flakes of assets fall,
can't I still withdraw my bonds for baby?

Good night moon.
Good night socks and good night cuckoo clocks.

Good night little bedpans and a trough where once there was an inn
(urn of dashed pride),
what are you doing beside little wheelbarrow
beside some fried chickens?

And you, ridiculous door-handles of the Arab's car,
opening long, long tunnel for little toothless princess,
why do you seem like sister-in-law going nowhere
on little exercise bike?

Good night barbells and Arbeiter's shoes
under plastered ceilings of Grundschulen.

Good night bladder of Helen Vendler and a jar from Tennessee.
(though what are these doing here in Dresden?)

Good night blackened parrot and some keys.
Good night, good night.

(And little mosque popped open like a can, which same as factory of
flypaper has blown outward, covering the shape of man with it (with
mosque): he stumbles up the Platz. What does it matter who is
speaking, he murmurs and mutters, head a little bit on fire.
Good night to you too.)

Good night moon.
Good night poor people who shall inherit the moon.

Good night first editions of Das Kapital, Novum Organum,
and How To Be A Success On Poetry Listservs.

Good night nobody.

Good night Mr. Kent, good night, for now you must
soon wake up and rub your eyes and know that you are dead.


8. [hoping it is my bad dialect]

David, it was a bit gauche of you to suggest you would cannibalize my
wife after eating me, but that much I don't really mind-- everyone
has a right to odd perversions, as long as such are consensual
or safely fanciful. What does nag at me a great deal is the Motel
6 reference, which in the net of your proto-narrative seems to
insinuate a tryst with my sister-in-law (whose maiden-name is not
Garcia, but what, as you say, is in a name?). I read and read. Please
assure me that it is only your bad English and that I am being too
much the "Ideal reader" (for I, too, admittedly, have a long outie
and am a paranoid). If you do not, then at the next Orono, when you
reach out your hand and say, "Pleased to make your acquaintance,"  I
shall take your hand, twist it 360 degrees, circle it about my head,
place it very high behind your back, and swiftly kick your
health-spa'd legs out from under you. This simple move, especially
effective against overly pumped-up contricants, is called "Dancing
with the Stud," and it was taught to me, actually, by a Cuban
military advisor.

At location (Orono) of lonely and looking-about poets, it shall be
hand-clapping time!


9. [your copyright permission, please]

Also, I wanted to mention that three magazines and three web-sites
have written unbidden to ask if they can reprint "Khartoum
Translation Conference," i.e. the one that  somehow threw you into
your snit of incendiary-jelly spurt. I think one of the magazines
(the one that makes people really, really angry by printing posts
without permission) may be interested in running our whole exchange,
beginning with your "brainwashed sudanese poet" up to wherever this
goes (for I don't doubt that you will come roaring back like the
stock-market, and I will even let you have the last word!).

Please excuse all the bad-writing parentheses, exclamations,
etc., but could you post me back-channel on the above possibility or
otherwise write an elliptical bombing poem to the List in reply?
Thank you, David!


10. [a cross-cultural saying]

All best to you, then. And as we used to gayly say in the German
Ideology game (with apologies here also for missing accent
and inverted question mark):

"Es este el sombrero, camarada, que se le cayo de la cabeza?"

Jacques I agree completely. It has continued to strike
me that many, many poets do write in a context of their
own period of age; we do represent the concerns of our
period, and everyone is influence highly by the time in
which they come of age. Of course this isn't EVERYTHING,
and there are wonderful and enormous exceptions (think of
the continual experimentation of Barbara Guest, for example [
of course this presumes wrongly that older poets no longer
experiment]). But generations to represent something. And I
think, moreover, that Paul was brilliant to put younger poets
and so-called "older" poets side by side. Are there substantial
differences, are the concerns generational? You'll have to read
RIBOT, I guess, and find out. But how can you even begin to answer
these questions (which I think, if they are not terribly
important are always very interesting) if you don't explore
something like this. RIBOT has done many a general issue; this
is a particular issue to explore a fascinating concern.

In response to Jacques point, I'd like to add that I don't think it arbitrary
exactly, but is produced from neccessity.  Paul told me that he'd been getting
lots and lots of submissions from young unknowns and that he'd like to show
case them, but as publishing these sorts of magazines is never economically
viable, he felt he should keep a core of well-known writers.  How to drop
Norma Cole for Leslie Scalapino (both are regular contributors) so you can
include Gwyn McVay, Emily Grossman, Tracy Grinnel (under 30 and whose
contributions are excellent) becomes a tricky matter.  Since Paul funds the
magazine out of his own pocket and has for years on a very limited budget, he
has to sell some magazines to keep this thing afloat.  Rather than merely
choose one friend or long time contributor over another, he was able to keep
the Waldrops, Baraka, Rakosi, and include space for the up and comers.  Now,
whether such a strategy pays off in terms of sales, I sorta doubt.  But,
Baraka (Funklore from Littoral Books was the all time biggest selling book
that Consortium Distributors ever carried) definitely helps keep the attention
of distributors and mean the books get out there.

I have to say that since I've seen the issue in galleys, no one will be
surprised at what Baraka does or Rakosi, but they might be surprised to see
that there are surface differences between the geezers and the young lions.
The geezers are by far more sparing in their use of language.  Also sort of
interesting is how many more women are there as young lionesses and how many
more men are there as geezers.  But the best thing about this issue as with
every issue of Ribot is the international scope.  Mohamed Dibb is there,
Emilio Pagliarani, and a number of young Italians who have never been
translated before, some young Mexicans translated by Rick Gilbert, just lots
of really interesting combination that defy almost any classification schema.

By the way, just got the new Chain in the mail with the pro forma plea for
contributions and subscriptions so I just want to take a moment and say how
important it is to BUY the magazines that you like rather than just expect
them to run your work because you are so brilliant.  When things like Chain
and Ribot and Arshile and so on go under, there will be no one to present your
genius to the world.
The new Chain is sleak and handsome as usual and the next one's theme of
Letters sounds really intriguing. As usual, it promises to introduce me to
lots of writers I might never have come across. We need to support the
magazines with themes (however arbitrary) and those without (however
overdetermined they may still be).

Erk! Erk!
But it reminds me of a poem by Charles Bukowski, in which he suddenly
realizes that in the time he has spent pumping iron he could have read the
complete works of Balzac - so he abruptly cancels his membership.

I've always heard great things about this conference (annual or
semi-annual, I think). I always thought it was Alan Golding who ran it, but
perhaps things have changed. It sounds like an intersting topic, and
complimentary to the conference here at San Diego that's taking place this
coming March. (More on this later).

read it about 1-2 years ago, so it's not too fresh in the head, but i saw
it generally as an attack on gratuitous abstraction, a call for a return to
the local, to words instead of "language", to combinations instead of
differences / i too had trouble, still do, defining the common knowledge,
though i think part of the book's appeal is that it resides so compellingly
poised on the edge of that definition -- at one point he writes something
about the current age coming to definition (soon?) in a present with a new
name -- a rough paraphrase -- which to me is part of the problem: we're
left teetering... / and of course, avoiding the definition of a new
paradigm, of paradigmatic thought in general, is one of its central ploys /
one sentence early on had me sold, though: "Poetry is made from sounds and
marks, but, paradoxically, *not* language..."

Kent, let me lapse into perfect english in the hope of avoiding
misunderstandings, although no doubt at the sacrifice of anything poetic. I
meant to imply nothing of the sort concerning your sister-in-law. I meant
no personal relation of Motel jokes to myself : it's standard-issue comic
material, the human dong. I never worked in a bakery : that was suggested
by the popping-up of the word "tarts" in the word-salad the persona of
Davood offered. In fact little of it was personal, although it is true that
your relative and I have spoken, fondly, of you, during our exercise-hour.
Your account of your time in Central America makes it sound like tough fun,
assuming it _is_ personal material. The difficult passages in my life are
nothing so noteworthy nor laudable, and I must cede the victory to you. I'm
not sure where the competitive edge came from--it's certainly in your tone
and I take it you are responding to something in mine, of which I stay
unaware.  As I expect you know, distorted texts such as we have been
exchanging cause all kinds of ping-ponging signification to go on behind
the surface, which is at once their pleasure and their pain. They can make
one paranoid, although I felt little of that with your latest, thanks to
its plain-spokenness. There is a certain right-minded quality to your
communications that I'd sooner not spend time on; it's not my fault you
don't have an endowed chair at Harvard; the Holier-Than-Thou Chair perhaps
would have done nicely. Your bully-boy braggadoccio is thin in humor, also.
Please, you are free to publish your Khartoum letter/s, which btw I found
hilarious--thanks for them. I don't think I want anything of mine to leave
the List for further publication just now, though. It's been fun, but I
doubt it can continue to be. I would sooner have sent this back-channel,
but your post required a front-channel response, I think.  David

PS I'm sorry I was unable to come up with a blurb for your book about being
a Japanese poet. I hope this lack of a response which I did not in the
first place offer, and certainly had not promised, has not caused some
emotional festering in your heart. But I am at a loss to account for the
gratuitous offensiveness in your latest post. Shall I return the book you
were kind enough to send?  D.

        Anselm, there was discussion on the List lately of a report carried
by some newspapers, that found a positive correlation between time spent on
the Net, and depression.  As I recall, however, the article did not say
whether those sampled had been depressed before they went on-line, nor, if
so, that their depression was now less, greater or about the same.

The social scientists said they were surprised : they had anticipated that
the opposite would be the case, i.e., that depression would be ameliorated
by e-mail, etc. As would I have. These results made the resaerchers posit
some causes, and I think one suggestion was, that the increased company,
not being tangible, or even visible,--that the virtuality of all this
proved an irritant, finally, and a thoroughly depressing one at that. "The
hungry sheep look up and are not fed." This proving the case, not much left
to do but disconnect and go sit in cafes with notebook and pen, or try
line-dancing. Back to Square One.

Other Listafarians will no doubt have their own takes on this topic.  Hope
all's well, Anselm.  David

One take on this is the ongoing discussion on the Research list among
people who have pioneered in IAD studies; they find the study flawed
to a great degree, without controls, with a slewed demographics, etc.
I also think they might be jealous that _this_ study got all the atten-
tion, while similar one's didn't.

It does seem to me to be true by and large, but it has a lot to do with
user's expectations. When I've taught I have found people thinking the Net
would be a lot easier than it is, that the interactivity would be simpli-
fied, that it would be easy to meet people online, that it would be a
kinder place than it is, that it would automatically bring people toge-
ther, that it would be fun, that the software would be simple to set up,
that the ISP software in particular would go in easily, and so forth and
so on. And all these things then confound people who might be uncomforta-
ble with the computer in the first place. As far as I know the study
didn't take into account who had or hadn't used computers before, things
like that. It makes a difference. One final issue by the way is the sheer
volume of information - beginning users tend to keep every email they get
(I know someone with 8000 files of it and someone else who has had up to
5000 messages in the inbox) - and then become extremely depressed when
they discover it's all useless, impossible to read, almost impossible to
catalog. Or someone looking, say, for articles on Japan, entering Japan in
say Alta Vista and coming up with several hundred thousand replies...

As I remember it was some major info/techno companies who were hoping that
the study would indicate just the opposite of what it did. I also seem to
remember that the study indicated a 1 percent increase on the depression
axis and a four/tenths of 1 percent increase on the alienation axis. The
researchers claim that these results are statistically significant. They
may be, but they don't seem earthshaking especially given what appear to
be the many faults of the study discussed here. GIGO! shit in, shit out.

thanx to matt for mentioning my book...

indeed i studied with don, so it's difficult to be objective (if that's
what i'm supposed to be)... but w/o trying to cozy up to the guy (b/c he's
someone i care for lots---but there i go!), and simple as i can say it,
don's book is one of the very few that attempts to map the contours of late
20th century north american thought and culture through the lens of poetic
urgencies and insurgencies (and not the other way 'round)... his syntax is
occasionally difficult, his theorizing often seems (seams) stream(s) of
consciousness... but if you can get with the flows, it's a most rewarding
excursion... if he doesn't manage to address ideological realities to
everyone's satisfaction, he does at the same time offer a critique of
technology, information technologies in particular, that works the
human-writing (or more broadly, making) interfaces...

there are answers in the book, in short, or directions, but the provocation
is such that there are no easy answers/directions... i see them in general,
and i trust this is not too abstruse, as having to do with (re)covering the
full measure of the finite (as opposed to the infinite)... which as don
would have it, as i read him, is less a matter of epistemology than of
ecology, less a matter of metaphysics than of physics... yes, a certain
utilitarian drift in don's prompts---but then, this is also a mark of our
age, no?...

well anyway, so i (would) think, like to or not... the concluding few pages
of the book are, in my view, breathtaking...

best,

joe

 One can say anything with statistics -- that's the joy and uselessness of
them.  It's rarely useful, I've found, to discuss depression in such terms
anyhow.  Reminds me of the psych. nurse, years ago, who told me to put on
some makeup and go to my activities so I wouldn't feel suicidal.

Great book, by the way, on depression is William Styron's Darkness Visible.
And it's about the length one can stand to read when moderately depressed.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

As I've posted before, I finished Don Byrd's The Poetics of The Common
Knowledge and was impressed by it on a number of levels. I always
welcome intellectual histories as informed, energetic and original as
the one that occupies the first couple of hundred pages. I disagree with
Byrd's idea that feedback and its attendant scientific and technological
applications erase old philosophical paradoxes and inconsistencies and
point toward a new epistemology, hermeneutics and poetry. But his
arguments concerning such matters that arise out of the work done by
Maturana, Verala, Prigogine, Bateson, Wiener et al are compelling and
have made me rethink and, I hope, refine a number of my positions. As
though this isn't enough reward for reading the book, Byrd squarely
places the sciences (artificial intelligence, cognitive science,
particle physics, chaos theory etc. etc.)at the center of
discourse--"The Common Knowlege"--where they most obviously are and this
includes poetic discourse. Joe Amato's observation seems indisputable:
there is a utile (to borrow David Jones' term) import to Byrd's book
that draws on the authority of the sciences. As far as I'm concerned,
given the squishy self-indulgence of the New Georgians, the intentional
and (f)utile hermeticism and critical dependency of langpo, and the
not-good-enough-for-prime-time performance poets et al, this is all to
the good for poetry. Byrd's plan, far from being eclectic, is focussed
and concrete and a great jumping off text for any further discussion
that, wants to connect (and I mean really connect) with current
conditions.---Carlo Parcelli

Not the least of these faults is that for those percentage differences to
be statistically significant the study population would have had to be
enormous.

I would agree that what might be measured by the study is disappointment
of heightened expectations.  If this were true of only 10% of the
participants it would skew the results.  If one were to survey (and I
think the study was a survey rather than a study although the media
tends not to make fine distinctionns) poetry readers vs. non-readers and
10% of the readers started in the expectation of receiving pleasure (an
interesting question in itself) they would be disappointed and the
survey would then "show" that reading poetry "causes" depression.  This
may be the case?

I'll be in New York 23-27 September & wondered what readings are going on
then.  I won't have evenings free, but there're still weekend afternoon
reading series, right?

Evenings on the 24th to 26th, at least, I'll be at Suspended Music,
concerts by Deep Listening Band (Pauline Oliverso, Stuart Dempster * David
Gamper) & Ellen Fullman's Long String Instrument (100 feet long) in the Low
Library building of the Columbia U campus. (The concerts are FREE & should
be very good - stop by & say hi).

(& as long I've got your attention, just put up this morning on Antenna
Radio, my feature program on John Cage. None of his poetry, but lots of
music. The show is Mappings at <http://www.antennaradio.com>.)

   Do you mean verify this personally?
    Like "Yeah, I WANNA TESTIFY WHAT THE Listserv's DONE TO ME"?

    If so, I wonder if anyone can verify the study that links
     "poetry scenes" to increased feelings of social isolation &
      major depressions among folks already suffering from said feelings
            ?

Yeah, don't know about ya'all but, when feeling suicidal, I feel
suicidal through makeup, activities and reading the posts on the poetics
list.

Which is to say that these communications, while at times game-like and
fun, could ever for me equal lying on my best friend's bed or my
neighbor ringing my bell.

It's in Six Short Masterpieces by Tolstoy -- which appears to be out of

CALIFORNIA FIRM TO TEST SUICIDE MACHINE
by B.P. Jackson and James R. "Tabby" Nackle

San Diego (MP) -- Announcing plans to seek beta sites for testing of a
new "bio-psych" technology to be mass-marketed over the Internet, a
California firm unveiled it's much ballyhooed "Execu-Will" suicide
kit. Leading computer advocates and local business leaders hailed the
announcement by MindMites of La Jolla as exemplary of the effects of
"hot money" on a region such as Southern California, where there are
numerous bio-psych companies. Critics criticized bio-psych as simply
new economic terrain created by the commodification of 1970s
"biofeedback" techniques. They claimed MindMites was only cashing in
on what amounted to natural, holistic processes, and vowed that they
would fight Execu-Will by offering their own suicide kit over the
Internet for free. "We hope to drive them out of business by making
what they hope to sell freely available," said Giovanni Troubadour, a
spokesman for the group "Anti BioPsych Alliance."
   Execu-Will works through a series of mediated suggestions which are
supposed to be taken literally, according to company insiders who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It works on the presumption that
if you read something, experience something, have a thought even, that
those things are to be regarded as true," the insider said.
"Execu-Will," the source continued, "regards that belief is the most
important tool is modifying human behavior and physiological
functioning." Through a complex series of thought patterns and
"throught-driven" modifications (heart rate, for instance) different
"goals" can be achieved. The goals of the Execu-Will suicide machine
are obvious: slowing of the heart rate to brain death, whereupon all
other functioning eventually ceases. However, to allieviate the
tendency towards self-preservation, the "machine's" bio-psych
functioning works to "execute the will," (i.e. the "will to live").
    For reasons which remain unclear, "fear" is the only anticipated
ingredient to have been left out of the Execu-Will package. It is
widely believed that many companies are rushing to develop and patent
different bio-psych combinations of thought patterns, and most experts
had believed that fear would be a major factor in the product
announced today. Fear has always been the most widely used bio-psych
tool. The hope of bio-psych firms is that new fear-based products will
lead to an explosion of new weapons technologies. Long in prototype,
the Execu-Will suicide machine had been anticipated for over a year.

        After Bernstein



        There's a price
        we shall pay for
        remaining above
        ground. Just like
        we flew to Florida,
        it's gonna cost.
        "Desirable beachfront
        hotel or condo"--
        that's what your life
        must amount to, now.

        You wanna poke your
        head up outa the earth,
        like some prairie dog?
        Like some living dead?
        Some insistent zombie?
        Okay let's see plastic
        on that. Full occupancy
        ensures rates stay high.
        You could be buried in
        one of many mass graves.
        Sprinkled with lime.
        Out of the future action.

        But (somehow--some
        secretary's social gaffe)
        here you are. So, whaddya
        got to say for yourself,
        Mr/Ms Living Tissue, huh?
        You're eminently replaceable.
        So far. We're barely waiting.
        The mere factoid of you,
        The Creation, palls fast.

        Those appurtenances--all of
        them--we can replace, & will.
        That pilgrim soul stacks up
        in warehouses globally. Our
        inventory embarrasses. So
        give it what you got plus,
        'cause we aren't in Kansas
        any more, no, nor New York.

        Hey! Your atoms persist--
        whyntya just check out?
        Space is at a premium,
        and evolution's draft picks
        were published yesterday.
        Godknows you're beautiful,
        lovely, talented, gifted,
        subjectively marvelous :
        but God quit the board
        in a snit. Hike it higher.

*** Deserted Channel Island chain regains Union Jack

PARIS (Reuters) - British honor was restored Thursday when invaders
from the non-existent kingdom of Patagonia handed back a flag seized
five days earlier from the most southerly outpost of the British
isles. However French eccentric Jean Raspail, self-proclaimed consul
general of Patagonia, warned that his marines would swing back into
action early in the next century and once again stake claim to the
deseerted Minquiers archipelago in the Channel. "Every so often the
Kingdom of Patagonia needs some territory," Raspail said after
handing back a slightly tattered Union Jack flag to the British
Embassy. See

Specieees being has been downraded to a tropical depression,
                a correction to too high prices
dearly puchased from a last fire sale, 'cause god gave Noah
                the rainbow sign
To the Haitian knuckler-baller escaping from bad derivatives
            on the coast-guard cutter
signing a contract with majordomo leagues 20 thousand, thousand
            under the sea.
But he played both ways, offense and defense, so he signed a contract
            with an agent who didn't know the  margins paid
Or the prices of moving expenses for living too long
            and not using the escape clause
to be, that is needs be the freee angent.

Yes to the below.  I was going to write to Joel about this backchannel,
but--after discussing the plans for the conference w/ Paul and Standard and
Guy Bennett, it's looking very clear that questioning the point of
generational divisions is going to have as much to with the discussion as
preserving them;
even if the magazine doesn't 'deconstruct generational markers' in the end,
I'll bet the conference will.

So, Joel, bring your picket sign; having a problem with the terms of the
discussion is a better reason to come than it is a reason not to.
(Also--you can do a Meow display at the book party.)

And I second the recommendation of Bill Luoma's book.  There's some mystery
of technique here--when I write anything with friends' names in it, it falls
flat, but this isn't the case in Works & Days.  And I don't entirely think
it's because some of the 'characters' are poets I've read, either.  I once
read a comment to the effect that Frank O'Hara's poems have -helped- make
all those people famous.

Some Europe


Why do the French, for example, Julia Kristeva and the chatterings asso-
ciated with the chora and ruptures, or Jean-Jacques Lecercle and delirium,
then take Gilles Deleuze on non-sense or Catherine Clement on rapture, or
the opening of Anti-Oedipus or practically the w/hole of Libidinal Econo-
my, then there's the latent hysteria in The Story of the Eye, I mean why
do the French - and this becomes something for the English or the Ameri-
cans - some sort of escape into the preconception of depth where no one
treads - there's always the unconscious - good etiquette keeps it down as
does the internal evidence of the text - for example foreclosing or fire-
walls around what constitutes sense - reading the endless descriptions in
P.D. James for example - there is a sort of rectitude of class everywhere
present in this thinking and I'd say even in for example the performative
which becomes clear-cut and no wonder everyone gets upset with Derrida
spilling ink all over the margins; of course Huntington's been taken apart
for his climatological theories of civilization, so we've got to look
elsewhere as France (yes, Kristeva and Derrida only half-way in and out,
and for that matter let's not forget Lacan's choratic behaviors on and off
the text) might be the testicle of Spain but there the image rummages
around and comes to an end - it's not as if there's the necessity for a
sudden bursting-forth like you get, maybe in Lautreamont, Rimbaud as well,
but you don't get in Japan and France isn't simply that regimented
although regimented indeed - so why there, language-control-subversion
_from the lowest levels_ in the form of a conspiracy I don't know - but
these _chatterings_ (let's not forget feminin ecriture, Irigaray, Wittig,
Cixous, or what might pass for masculin ecriture, Barthes, Sollers for
two, ever read his Women? I did for the in-sites) are everywhere, taking
apart foundations or what might pass for them (let's not forget however
Rene Thom, the Bourbaki, even Benoit Mandlebrot on the other side of the
coin, all these mother-structures appearing - I'd put Pierre Duhem's
analysis somewhere in the middle of all this) - you've got cooling ponds
on the surface with their ordered ciliated enfoldings of structured
shorelines and down deep, Leviathans breaking out (look at Roustang or
Clement Rosset, now we're talking) or shuttling around the surface (then
there's the German analyses of classical geometric surfaces and their
ur-structures, think of Klein, although there are Manning and Sommerville
for n-dimensional stuff, not to mention Coxeter) - one might wonder about
the flaneur tradition (situationism, Baudelaire, Beau Brummel) as far as
that goes, the whole francophonic enterprise as it were, one great derive
- look at Balzac and one couldn't leave out, in the entirety across the
board, Rabelais - or the Flaubert of Saint Anthony or Salome - from which
all sorts of disturbances erupt - I prefer Bouvard and Pecuchet myself -
it's subtler there, the choratic breaking out as ripples across the cool-
ing ponds, especially in the received notions section of the book - one
might place, especially in regard to derive, the vagabonding of Villon
naturally enough - as if nature were artifice vis-a-vis Mallarme (not to
mention the Quebecois Gaston Miron, which opens up all sorts of possibil-
ities - Nicole Brossard's ecriture feminin, Hubert Acquin's Robbe-Grillet
coupled with frisson and anti-colonialism, Paul Chamberland's eruption,
Marie Claire-Blais' burning homes, flamed desires) - as Victor Beaulieu
might point out the Catholicisms erupting as well (look at Bataille, Lei-
ris once again, no wait, Verlaine), even sciences' chatterings in the
guise of Michel Serres (not to mention Foucault somewhere hungering about
the Bourbaki if I had my way about it) - or Sartre's Being and Nothingness
finishing off with slimy holes, you get the picture (all those theories of
representation, say Christian Metz) - broken by Baudrillard turning rup-
ture into rapture into and out of fine art - it's a big swirl, it has no
beginning and no end, it just goes round and round and doesn't escape the
borders of the continent - oh yes, it's been incontinent - there have been
missives, missions, missionaries - unceasing flooding of lapped shores
world-wide - Celine would pause at one or another point here - place three
little dots - _all_ those shores - I'll refuse to do it - it's been an
industry (don't forget for a second the analyses of Pierre Bourdieu, Regis
Debray) - it turns in on itself - it implodes - a precession of thinking
simulacra - (actants maybe in Greimas, sad and fallen leaves and leavings
in Violet Leduc) - world-wide influence (Sartre and de Beauvoir beaver to
his mister, Levi-Strauss' discontent with structure turned music, telling
his way through the saying of culture in spite of everything or Piaget
bringing it back in essai de logique operatoire) - one's got to give cre-
dit to rapture still (Michel Tournier doing to Robinson Crusoe or The
Ogre) - just a moment, the phone's ringing (Pierre Levy on the other end
of the line) (extending outward like hermaphroditic pubic hair) (curling
around Sarduy as everyone comes to Paris) (drugged by Michaux) (killed by
Artaud) just a moment, the bell's ringing (running down the flow) (someone
I don't know)

MORE PROOF FROM THE MAELSTROM

Extract from the Durbanville Times 23 July 1998:

Rita de Grooning, a paraplegic garage attendant in Durbanville, recently
remarked that during the troubled years after her first accident, damaging
and ultimately losing a leg while clearing mines in southern Sudan, she
turned to the work of E M Cronenmeyer, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poet of South Africa.

“Cronenmeyer is instantly forgettable, he's so difficult and manages to
avoid stating anything clearly. I spent hours trying to work out what he was
on about. It's brilliant stuff," remarked de Grooning. "I was faced with
some difficult political situations up there. Poverty, war, disease. It’s
refreshing to turn to a poet like Cronenmeyer to get away from the real
world."

Asked to clarify, de Grooning went on, "Well, when someone’s dying under an
oppressive regime, there's more than one possible angle- they get it wrong,
taking it personally. Especially women, who haven’t had much luck with
pronouns in literature anyway, I guess. We need poetry that avoids personal
history, is really difficult and means little to the people being
slaughtered. That’s clearly the way forward for poetry; I've read all the
theories."

The collected works of E M Cronenmeyer, "Oh God, I Really Hate Pronouns", is
available from Sin-Tax, Cape Town.

Above the world-weary horizons New obstacles for exchange arise Or unfold,
O ye
postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.

There are presently over 600 subscribers.

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list=
 should
not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep=
 the
list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also to keep
the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While=
 individual
posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we continue to
work
to promote the editorial function of this project. The definition of that
project, while provisional, and while open to continual redefinition by list
participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized discussion of poetry.
Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend those directions in=
 poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to=
 the
creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible. **We also encourage subscribers to post information on
publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in=
 which
they appear (see section 9 below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,=
 and
become part of an on-line archive. *Posting to Poetics is a form of
publication, not personal communication.* Participants are asked to exercise
caution before posting messages! While spontaneity of response may seem the
very heart of the list at its best, it also has the darker side of=
 circulating
ideas that have not been well considered (or considered by another reader --
editor or friend). Given the nature of the medium, subscribers do well to
maintain some skepticism when reading the list and, where possible, to try=
 to
avoid taking what may be something close to a spontaneous comment made in=
 the
heat of exchange as if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader
Beware!").

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.=20
For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.

___________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you subscribe
with
your real name and we reserve the right to request additional information,
including address and phone number. All subscription information you supply
will remain confidential.

You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line=
 message,
with no subject line, to:

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your name=
 to
unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow several
days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.

*

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the=
 Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you may be
able to substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may=
 get
bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us. If
the
problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from your
system
administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is part of your
scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider obtaining a=
 commercial
account.

In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,=
 simply
resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account problem has
been resolved.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription=
 or
subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's administrative=
 address:
poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may take up to ten days, or
more,
for us to reply to messages.
____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other
unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.=
 Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from=
 this
list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages are
received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional messages
until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day. While it is
difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily, weekly, or=
 monthly
posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in mind. If you plan to
respond to multiple threads, it is generally preferable to consolidate your
reply into one message. While relevant excerpts from a post to which you are
responding may usefully be appended to your reply, please do not include in
your new post the whole text of a long previously posted message. As an
outside
maximum, the listserv is set to accept no more than 5 messages a day from=
 any
one subscriber.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a=
 post,
since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or
who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are
always welcome. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or=
 supply
information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting something you
requested, please send the request or comment to the individual backchannel,
not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted Poetics
message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to receive ONE
message each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for=
 that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply to this
message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for
any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may=
 lose
not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily turn
off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"

set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail
message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather
long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics subscribers.=
=20
This list is alphabetized by server not name.

or try:

review POETICS by name review POETICS by country

which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country
(since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)

*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a=
 specific
subscriber.*

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to=
 serve
as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in formally
innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center provides
access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new poetries
including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct=
 connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides=
 information
about contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in=
 poetry
and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets'
reading their work, as well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview
series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the links=
 to
Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year or search=
 them
for specific information. Your interface will allow you to print or download
any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications=
 as
easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a list=
 of
your press/publications to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press
Listing in the subject line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write=
 file
name, word processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail=
 message
to the address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If your word processor will save files in Rich Text Format=
 (.rtf)
this is also highly desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover
copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check=
 the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you
have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

THE INTELLIGENT ESSAY ASSESSOR
A psychology professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder is
spearheading the creation of an Intelligent Essay Assessor, a computerized
tool to assist professors in grading students' written essays.  Thomas
Landauer says that to use the program, a professor must first teach it to
recognize both good and bad essay writing by feeding it examples of both,
which have been manually graded.  The program can also be trained using what
he calls a "gold standard" -- passages from textbooks or other materials
written by experts on the same subject as the essay to be graded.  While
earlier digital essay graders work by analyzing essays mechanically --
looking at sentence structures and counting commas, periods and word lengths
-- Landauer says his program can actually "understand" the student's writing
using sophisticated artificial intelligence technology called "latent
semantic analysis."  It does so by comparing the patterns of word usage in
student essays with the usage patterns it has learned from the initial
samples, enabling the computer "to a good approximation, to understand the
meanings of words and passages of text."  If an essay appears to convey the
same knowledge as those used in the examples, the computer gives it a high
score.  The Intelligent Essay Assessor is not meant to be used to grade
essays in English-composition or creative-writing assignments, where a
student is being graded more on writing skill than subject knowledge.

Ron,

This seems like a joke, especially the title of Cronenmeyer's book & his
wonderfully pedantic comment, "I've read all the theories."  Does anyone
out there know anything about this Cronenmeyer?  Maybe someone could
post a work of his on the list so we can see what he's up to.  If this
turns out not to be a put-on, then it seems to suggest that
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry can be a kind of escapism-- or at least, escapism
for the oppressed!  So I'm a little surprised to find you, Ron Silliman,
suggesting this as hopeful (though I think I would agree with you, if
only because the work's being *read*, poetry finding some use (however
ironically) in the world at large).  Hey, I like some escapism myself--
it's just not the only thing I want....

I had Ron Silliman's _Sunset Debris__ onsite for some weeks before I got
around to reading it, even though friend and big fan of the author. Then
one of those horrible nights when you can't sleep and a too-generous quota
of your omissions and inadvertencies camps in your mind, I picked it up and
was totally engaged. It is difficult material formally though not at
sentence level, difficult to endure, but I needed something that would stop
my wheels spinning, and I read it from start to finish (it would be
confusing to say A-Z!). It quieted me by holding my attention. This was not
what I would describe as escapist.

Perhaps the word is being used inaccurately, in this thread. However, I can
well suppose that in tough circumstances, easy reads can feel thin, w/o
enough substance to be worth entering. Isn't this what's being said?  David

Franklin, LA Boys, listers, Ribotters, thanks for the generational
surge in protective alliances among the best of friends, in the worst
of times.  Without really trying to defend a position, or without
having to imply any real belief whatsoever, let me remark upon the
controversy which now has escalated to a full-fledged San Diego-LA
war. The true spirit of west-coast road rage has gotten to me. You
don't even have a football team!

ok ok ok. I'm sorry if my question about age/generational groupings
seemed rooted in a criticsm of the Ribot conference upcoming this next
month. It certainly wasn't intended as that, although when it was
announced it struck me and I've thought about it a lot lately; as well
earlier this summer in Buffalo a generational "poetry festival" was
held, although on much smaller terms. Certainly given the
proliferation of forms and scenes, the internet, blah blah blah, the
failure to have any sense of ideological "centering" (like a war, or a
cause, but not princes Diana) might cause especially younger people to
seek more demographic methods of defining ourselves. The baby boomer
poets. The generation x poets. etc. etc. The anxiety about not having
any criteria around which to organize ourselves , it could be said to
be perhaps the only unifying characteristic of poets under 40. This
anxiety about relationships to one's peers and elders, including
access to the ability to redress the boundaries of literary
inheritance. It certainly has been an endless feature of the dialogs
on this list, though it didn't begin here.

And I think I might as well say it and try to dig my way out of it
later, and maybe it's what I've been trying to propose, neither as
advocate nor critic, but also (and not purely in dialectical terms,
either) as both critic and advocate. And it is esentially that the
terms underlying such formations of group identity, including editing
a press or a magazine, that the terms of it are largely social issues
and are comprised of all the usual things that define social life;
that the formal criteria proposed are often uselessly vague (i.e.
"innovative" and "experimental" as terms serve only to define the
group's social boundaries and not the "work itself"). I think that
there are good things and bad things to this tendency. And I'm not
proposing that we replace the network-social model with a bureaucratic
proceduralism by which the "best poem" is always found utilizing
machinic concepts of determining [insert evaluative criterion here] as
regards taste, judgement, etc. I think a "social theory of editing"
could have a positive role in developing the expanding poetry markets
in the neighborhoods of southern california, for instance. And that
you could conduct a workshop on the "social theory of editing" and you
could do it with the verve of labor organizer, or a composition
teacher.

BY THE WAY
for those who think that listserv technologies will simply be outlawed
for causing anxiety, depression, stress, and endless "gossip" (i.e.
literature)--think again. You can't return the south pacific to its
pre-colonial status anymore than you can get the US dollars out of
Quebec...

And to go back to it, it never seemed to me that the terms of the
Ribot Conference were in anyway going to be about generational
definitions, etc., and I'm sorry to hear that issue has now been
placed on the docket, for I personally think it is a waste of time.
There is a lot happening that weekend: doesn't the Arshile reading
happen that day too? I would like to go up to the conference, and
would like to go to LA even before then for some events, so please
post them here to the list. But the age-issue really doesn't seem like
all that interesting a topic to me. If we can make it a valuable topic
for conversation, then let's hear it, thank-you. Because aside from
attempts at valuating the startling juxtapositions created by placing
an unknown20somthing alongside an established 60something...  I mean I
can't get beyond what seems unavoidably humorous in this setup. Why
not find an established 20somthing (and they're out there, dammit) and
put her next to an unknown 60something...  but hey, I'm there. I'll go
just to hear the poetry, okay, the startling juxtapositions don't say
anything "in themselves"--commentary, give me some interpretation!

For the record, I'm less interested in being included than I am in
hearing what the criteria are. And this is true most of the time. So
my placard idea was only a joke...but I will be up there and so will
some of the San Diego Unit of the poetry reserves.

RE: BILL LUOMA
There is a kind of Social theory behind WORKS & DAYS and one which I
think could be a model for group formation. And not group formation
with a sense of us & them, but group formation in the sense of
tactical defense techniques.
    Franklin writes that when he tries to write about his friends it
is "flat" compared to Luoma's work. I think that he's right and I am
cuirous to know how this works. There is an "x"factor in this book,
which gives off a glow. There is something immediately engaging for me
about this highly social work. And it isn't something that I
experience in every work which uses the proper noun, so a lot of talky
fake new york school stuff leaves me cold. There is somthing to MY
TRIP TO NYC and the other works--something which is carried across all
the works. I don't know how to describe it--pathos?--perhaps, but it
is something which is made possible by the fluid style of the
paragraphs which allow him to submit "unrelated" observations to the
catalog of actions, verbal and active actions, which comprise his
work. Some of these, like the line "I never know why people in love
spend time apart when they could be dead in two years" rip open
whatever protective covering I had put myself into and the raw
emotions of tears and spit and snot seem to be the punctuation to a
kind of linguistic utterance more closely aligned with the scream than
any other--   and this is the first book of poetry I have read this
decade that made me cry. I'm glad I got to it when I did.  and I
realize that's a bizarre criteria for liking a work. For me, Luoma
provides a history book about a group of friends, more than he records
a literary history. And what is interesting about these people isn't
that I know them or know who they are, but that Bill knows them and
there is an accumulation of knowledge and experience made possible by
the sustained ability to record in a compiling sort of way (like
Myles' "anchorman"?) all of the events which register as actions.
Obviously it is edited: no one loves baseball that much. And there is
the danger that its most endearing characters become like "gargoyles"
pried loose from a place where they are valued, hanging by a thread
above a crowded city street. How Luoma is able to maintain the
integrity of friends whose lives he effectively "represents" is worth
discussing. Something about "the treatment "" of that personal-detail
material. and you can imagine a book like this will someday be the
subject of lawsuits, if not this book, one inspired by it. In fact, it
is one of the few books wherein the names aren't changed. Maybe that
is what finally makes it "poetry"

Someone wrote me back channel that in new york, if you wanted to hang
out, then you were part of the group. In a sense that spirit describes
the tone of Luoma's book.

I have more to say about all this, but it's confused and I'm eager to
go outside now that the sun has gone in for the day.   love, Jimmy

Content-Type: text/plain

My work is a great soporific I've been told.

I've lately begun reading my way through all of the "other" Faulkner
novels beyond the usual half dozen that everyone gets in college (or got
when I went some 28-30 years ago). I picked up one, The Unvanquished,
sort of by chance about 6 months ago, just coming off of David Wallace's
Infinite Jest and was stunned by how much mind was present in every
single sentence than I'd gotten from any "mainstream" novel in many a
year (since Gravity's Rainbow perhaps). Yet in fact they do read "easy"
if you can avoid getting completely stopped by some of the gargantuan
knots of syntax, which are themselves totally worth the experience.

But I've written before that much of the power of fiction comes
precisely from the displacement of the effects of language onto symbolic
structures, of which character is a main formation.

Ron

Since the Carnegie-Mellon study alleging Internet-caused depression
continues to surface, the following story from today's Washington Post may
be of interest.



A Search for Net Impact on Social Life=20

                  By John Schwartz=20
                  Washington Post Staff Writer=20
                  Monday, September 7, 1998; Page A3=20

                  What is the Internet doing to us?=20

                  The burgeoning online medium has proved an irresistible
subject of study
                  by social scientists thrilled to see a new society
emerging virtually
                  overnight. Academics are examining every facet of online
life for
                  America's millions of Internet users, including the ways
people use the new
                  medium, its successes and failures in education and
medicine, the
                  prospects for electronic commerce and the development of
communities
                  of people linked via modem.=20

                  But despite a great deal of research, "We know very
little about how the
                  Internet is actually affecting people's lives," said
James E. Katz, a leading
                  researcher in the field and professor in the Department
of Communication
                  at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.=20

                  Last week a much-touted study from Carnegie Mellon
University
                  suggested that users of the Internet become lonely and
socially withdrawn.

                  "The more people were online, the more signs they gave of
being a little bit
                  more socially isolated," in responses to standardized
questionnaires used
                  by researchers to measure depression, stress and strength
of social ties,
                  said Robert Kraut, the lead author of the study.=20

                  Reports on the study sparked a strong reaction in the
online world from
                  people like Arthur R. McGee, 32, an employee of a San
Francisco-based
                  Internet service provider for nonprofit groups. "Going
back as far as I can
                  remember, my use of [online communications] has GREATLY
increased
                  my human interaction," McGee said on WELL, a Sausalito,
Calif.-based
                  online service. "I've met more people IN PERSON of
varying ethnic and
                  social backgrounds than I would have without these
communication tools."

                  But computer author Robert Lauriston countered, "I think
a lot of people
                  are in denial about the negative effects of spending too
much time online."
                  On the global conference system known as Usenet, Donna
Gettings, 43, a
                  manager of an at-home medical transcription service in
Pittsburgh,
                  quipped, "According to this survey, I guess I committed
suicide some time
                  ago."=20

                  The Carnegie Mellon study is part of HomeNet, a $1.5
million project in
                  which 93 Pittsburgh families were given free computers
and Internet
                  accounts. The three-year-old project has already
published studies
                  showing, for example, that use evolves from initial
passive World Wide
                  Web surfing to communication activities such as e-mail
and Usenet. The
                  group has also shown that people who view pornography
online tend to
                  greatly decrease their porn surfing after the novelty
wears off.=20

                  HomeNet, however, has its limits. The 169 participants
are a small group
                  and were not selected at random =96 two things that make i=
t
difficult to
                  generalize any study results to a larger population. The
researchers also
                  did not follow a "control," or similar group that had no
Internet access,
                  generally considered an essential component of any such
work, said Jim
                  Thomas, a professor of sociology at Northern Illinois
University. That the
                  researchers only surveyed the participants twice =96 once
before they went
                  online, then a year later =96 is a serious weakness, said
Donna L. Hoffman,
                  a researcher at Vanderbilt University. The Carnegie
Mellon researchers
                  themselves note that the study's large population of
teenagers, who tend to
                  grow depressed and withdrawn, is one factor that may have
skewed the
                  results.=20

                  The new research is "not ready for prime time," Hoffman
said. "This is not
                  saying that the Internet does not cause depression,"
though she doubts it
                  does because such a finding would "run counter to
experience, anecdotal
                  evidence, practice and scholarly research" like her own.
"Maybe it does =96
                  but this research does not prove that."=20

                  The notion that Net use might cause depression "surprised
us," said
                  Carnegie Mellon study co-author William Scherlis. He was
careful to note
                  that "the effects that we noticed are small, but they are
statistically
                  significant. . . . It's not a big enough effect that if
you use the Internet                too many hours, you're going to wake up one
morning and need a prescription
                  for Prozac."=20

                  "These are relatively minor symptoms of depression,"
Kraut explained,
                  "more like being in a funk than being suicidal."=20

                  Kraut declined to even attempt to translate the slight
drop on an abstract
                  scale of loneliness that the researchers used into real
terms. "I'm not taking
                  too seriously the actual numbers people are reporting;
I'm taking seriously
                  the fact that there is a trend."=20

                  Scherlis suggested that simple changes could make
Internet exploration a
                  less solitary pursuit =96 simply moving the computer from =
a
basement office
                  to the family room, for example.=20

                  Kraut said the various uses of the Internet might affect
mood; simple Web
                  surfing, which for the most part resembles television
viewing, might leave
                  users feeling enervated and somewhat down =96 as televisio=
n
can. Reaching
                  out to others through electronic mail, discussions and
participation in
                  online communities, on the other hand, might make people
feel more
                  connected and positive =96 especially if they tend to buil=
d
the strong bonds
                  of friendship and support that are still more common in
the real world than
                  in the online one. A preponderance of weak relationships,
they suggest,
                  might not have the same uplifting effect. Those factors
could be seized on
                  by companies offering Internet services to come up with a
better product,
                  Kraut said.=20

                  The group's initial analysis of mood and various kinds of
Internet use,
                  however, has not borne out Kraut's theory; he said more
research is
                  needed.=20

                  Other researchers are examining the Internet with
different results.
                  Rutgers's Katz and colleague Philip Aspden, executive
director of the
                  Center for Research on the Information Society, surveyed
2,500 Internet
                  users and found no evidence of social withdrawal: Online
participants are
                  no less likely to join religious, leisure or community
organizations than
                  people who aren't online, the research indicated.=20

                  Hoffman and partner Tom Novak at Vanderbilt University's
Project 2000
                  have collaborated with researchers at the Georgia
Institute of Technology
                  and others, and focus in part on consumers and what they
find compelling
                  in electronic commerce. Their research, too, suggests
that many Web
                  users consider being online to be both positive and
enriching, leading to a
                  satisfying mental state known as "flow."=20

                  No one yet knows where various threads of research will
lead, and
                  Carnegie Mellon's Scherlis warns against reducing
scientific results like his
                  to a "bumper sticker" notion that the Internet is
depressing or somehow
                  dangerous and should therefore be controlled or
restricted. The findings
                  "should in no way give anybody an excuse to delay
bringing the Internet
                  into the home or into the schools or into the inner city
=96 or anywhere else
                  for that matter," he said.=20

Herb,
this may be a shot in the dark but.  i heard on the CBC a piece that
featured someone(s) playing a lone piano wire strung between two distant
points in a church. i can't remember how it was "played" but i still
remember it almost ten years later. are these the same people? does anyone
know what i'm talking about?

it was beautiful.

Yr so lucky getting to read those other Faulkners for the first time. When
I was in my twenties I simply sat down and read them all thru (exceptThe
Rievers, which came out later) and even then I knew that I was never going
to have an experience like that ever again. Since then I have never sat
down and read someone right through. There are still about 4 Queneau books
I get to read for the first time. But you have to get really careful,
because meting them out to yrself that way, you can miscalculate and die
before you have read, say, _The Blue Flowers_.

 Innovation and Experimentation in Contemporary American Poetry

What criteria delimit the margins of American poetry today?  What is the
role of the lyric and narrative in the elliptical, fragmented and
disjunctive approach utilized by many contemporary poets. How has Language
poetry given way or split off from other "experimental" poetries and how do
gender and race figure into those divergence's?  How has performance poetry
altered, popularized or skirted the "poetry establishment"?  What projects
have poets undertaken to analyze, bridge, or deconstruct the mutually
marginal spheres of "high" and "low" poetry today?

We particularly invite papers on poets such as, Rae Armantrout, Lucy
Brock-Broido, Anne Carson, Lynn Emanuel, Elaine Equi, Jorie Graham,
Barbara Guest, Lyn Hejinian, Brenda Hillman, Susan Howe, Ann Lauterbach,
Bernadette Meyer, Jane Miller, Tracie Morris, Harryette Mullen, Alice
Notely, Susan Wheeler and
others.

 This three-day conference sponsored by Women Poets at Barnard will begin
on Thursday, April 8 with a poetry reading, and continue through Saturday,
April 10.  The keynote speaker will be Marjorie Perloff.  The conference
will feature critical papers as well as additional poetry readings.  Papers
received by January 5 will receive priority, but papers will be read
through January.  Papers grouped as panels welcome.  Please submit to
either Claudia Rankine, English Dept, Barnard College, 3009 Broadway, New
York, NY 10027 or Allison Cummings, English Dept, Hampden-Sydney College,
Hampden-Sydney, VA 23901.

I liked Infinite Jest okay also. The secret sources for it as a book, I
think, are the work of John Barth and Anthony Burgess (I was surprised
to see "horrow show" appear more than once). His sense of the sentence
is entirely utilitarian and his ear is tin, but his sense of
construction and the grotesque are marvelous. The scene in which the son
describes his initial reactions to his father's suicide (depicted in
terms of smell) was amazing. I found it odd, given his own background as
a tennis prodigy, that the people who really seemed "felt" as characters
were all the ones in the half-way house.

But any novel that has several hundred footnotes (including several with
key plot twists) is okay by me.

        I feel a little like I have been reading other people's mail,
but I appreciate all of the
kind things that have been  said about _The Poetics of the Common
Knowledge_.

        There is a structure.  Three androgynes--called Symbolic Nature
(Descartes), Symbolic History (Hegel), and Symbol Person (Freud)--the
second, in some sense being already the product of the  interaction
between the first and third-- hop into bed and mother-father
twins--together called Symbolic Symbols (information theory), one called
the Statistical and the other called the Non-statistical.The Statistical
is the reality that Neilsen and Gallop track (the only public reality
that is widely recognized; the Non-statistical is the realm of poetry.
(There is a sub-version of each chapter that
addresses a poet, Duncan, Stein, Zukofsky, and Olson respectively).

      The non-statistical  is  non-exemplary. The instance cannot be
used to read a group.   It holds to the earth not by manifesting nature,
history, person, or symbols (language), but by what Anthony Braxton
calls in connection with his music "gravitational intrique."  I wish I'd
had that term when I was writing the book.

            Again thanks.  It is always gratifying to be read.  A reader
that will stick
with a book as long and turgid as PCK is to be doubly appreciated. (By
the way,
for any prospective readers, there is a little comic relief about half
way in, a chapter in which I compare Wallace Stevens and Jackie
Gleason--Ralph Kramden).

Even if you've read Don Byrd's book it helps to have read some of the
myriad of core texts that Byrd uses. Much of the books appeal for me was
the fact that many of the books that Byrd brings to bear in his exegesis
were works that I had read especially in the sciences and philosophy. I
found the overlap startling and this meager sampling nonetheless
reinforced in my mind the sense that Byrd had indeed tapped "the Common
Knowledge."---Carlo Parcelli

time to type them up.

THE SUN & MOON PRESS CAMPAIGN TO FREE ITS POETRY

Sun & Moon Press has long been known for its publishing
and promotion of a wide-range of contemporary poetic voices.
But we recently recognized that some of these voices have
been kept prisoner on our shelves, locked away from the
very audience for which they were intended. We hope to
address this terrible injustice by offering our SUN & MOON
PRESS CAMPAIGN TO FREE ITS POETRY. Below is a list (posted
in several parts) of some of the books that simply got
lost in the shuffler of the Press's poetic proliferation.

We are offering these titles for the amazingly low price
of $4.00 each plus postage ($1.25 added postage per book).

To order simply write the quantity on each line before the
title and return to Sun & Moon Press (6026 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles, CA 90036) with a check for the cost of books
and postage.

Help us to free some of these great poetic achievements.

_____Will Alexander. ASIA & HAITI (paper, list price $12.95)
     As a Black American Surrealist poet and painter, Will
     Alexander has no equal, and his influence is now being
     felt internationally. Demonstrating the influences of
     the poets of Negritude, contemporary history and
     economics, and the forces at play in Alexander's home
     city of Los Angeles, ASIA & HAITI is, as CUPS wrote,
     "Truly incendiary."

____ Pierre Alferi. NATURAL GAITS (paper, list price $10.95)
     If Alexander and his poety is "incendiary," young French
     poet Pierre Alferi is absolutely "hot." His work has
     received major acclaim in his homeland, and his editing,
     with Olivier Cadiot, of LA MéCANIQUE LYRIQUE created a
     true poetic sensation in Paris. "A geography of silence,
     formed with stern images--both vibrant and still." --Rhizome

____ Claes Andersson. WHAT BECAME WORDS (paper, list price $11.95)
     Member of the Finnish Parliment, jazz pianist, literary ac-
     tivist, former editor of an avant-garde magazine, psychiatrist,
     and Minister of Culture, Claes Andersson is a wonder, and
     these poems are trul revelatory: funny, dramatic, philosophical,
     insightful." A man once thought, in desperation: / The best
     thing would be to hang myself / in the nearest ocean."

____ Bruce Andrews. GIVE EM ENOUGH ROPE (paper, list price $10.95)
     Britian's REALITY STUDIOS wrote of this great poetic collection
     in 1988: "It is a virtuoso technique and a relentless inven-
     tiveness that enable the ambition of this difficult writing,
     which delights, inspires and disquiets in its accomplishment."
     Andrews writes: "Narcissism is like not seeing that there could
     be a private language of the body which is social -- Guerilla
     means everyone has the tools to do it." One fourth street
     vendor, hipster, tent revivalist, academic moralist, and just
     plain everyman from Dubuque, Andrews gets the blood flowing
     clear up to the head.

____ Bruce Andrews. I DON'T HAVE ANY PAPAER SO SHUT UP (or, Social
     Romanticism) (paper, list price $13.95)
     The noted poet of LOVE SONGS, GETTING READY TO HAVE BEEN
     FRIGHTENED, EXECUTIVE SUMMARY and numerous other works is
     up to his politico-spiritual highjinks again in this
     brilliant book."An energized, headlong glance into the
     originality of this controversial writer," observed THE
     WILSON LIBRARY REVIEW upon the 1994 publication of SHUT
     UP. "Gesalt me out!"

____ Rae Armantrout. MADE TO SEEM (list price, $9.95)
     Award-winning poety David Bromige wrote: "I would like to be
     able to write a few elegant sentences on Rae Armantrout's
     poetry. I admire it tremendously, I love it, I find her to
     be the finest writer of the short lyric poem in English
     today. Except that of course it is the anti-lyric. And anti-
     rhetoric too, anti-elegant sentence, it turns an amused grin --
     a veritible medusa of an amused grin -- towards superlatives,
     towards whatever smacks of flattery, towards the impressionistic,
     towards what talking-about can do -- or rather, can't do."

____ Rae Armantrout. NECROMANCE (paper, list price $8.95)
     Noting the "feel" of narrative weaving through Armantrout's
     great lyrics, the reviewer of THE BLACK WARRIOR REVIEW noted
     of this 1991 publication: "There is not possibility of giving
     away the ending, none of what I've written here prepares
     for her surprises." Elaine Equi observed in THE POETRY PROJECT
     NEWSLETTER, "In the poetry world where so much depends upon
     having a style that's easy to categorize, Armantrout makes
     you believe that there is still such a thing as originality."

____ Ece Ayhan. A BLIND CAT BLACK and ORTHODOXIES (paper, list
     price $10.95)
     WORLD LITERATURE TODAY wrote of this publication: "Ece Ayhan
     (b. 1931) has been a marvelous maverick of Turkish poetry
     since he erupted on the scene in the 1950s. ...Every element
     of his poems became esoteric, oblique, indecipherable. ...{But]
     the language, sometimes deceptively simple, at times staccato,
     has a way of dazzling with all its obscurities." As for the
     artists Paul Klee or Arshile Gorky, behind Ayhan's seemingly
     abstract images "there are subtle and often sly symbols, most
     of which deal with minority cultures." Whore, homosexual,
     pederast, betrayer, these are the people of Ayhan's beautifully
     troubling world.

Here is the second installment of our big Sun & Moon Poetry sale


____Djuna Barnes. THE BOOK OF REPULSIVE WOMEN: 8 RHYTHMS AND
    5 DRAWINGS (paper, list price $6.95)
    Originally published in the chapbook series of Bruno of
    Greenwhich Village in 1915, this renowned volue of poetry
    presnets portraits of the period--a mother, prostitute,
    cabaret dancer, and others--which seemed wildly radical
    in their day, and still reveal the great American writer
    Barnes's deep roots in the milieu of the New York of the
    first decade of this century.

____Clark Coolidge. OWN FACE (paper, list price $10.95)
    First published in 1978, OWN FACE represents a growing shift
    of that period of Coolidge's career from a more structurally
    based, abstract writing to a more personal and lyrical work.
    This book plays with the notion of the self and other, from
    its cover photography--which is not the author but spelunker
    Floyd Collins--to its contents, highly charged, seeming personal
    lyrics, which move always outward to the reader and his own
    encounter with language. One of the most important of this great
    Amrican poet's books.

____Henri Deluy. CARNAL LOVE (paper, list price $11.95)
    One of the most noted of French poets writing today, Henri
    Deluy, editor of the famed journal ACTION POéTIQUE, explores
    the various aspects of love in this major collection of
    poetry, first published in France in 1994, and translated here
    by Guy Bennett. "Borrowing some of the strategy of Sacher-
    Mosher, master of erotic suspense, Deluy as found a language
    chained to law, but nonetheless thrills. You may find yourself
    willing to be disciplined, but only if your know in advance
    that desire is most effective when thrown into abeyance," wrote
    RHIZOME.

____Ray DiPalma. MOCK FANDANGO  (paper, list price $5.00)
    A 20 Pages chapbook of three long poems by noted American poet
    Ray DiPalma.

____Ray DiPalma. NUMBERS AND TEMPERS: SELECTED EARLY POEMS
    (paper, list price $11.95)
    The first comprehensive survey of DiPalma's writing, this book
    presents a selection of his best work, and shows the fascinating
    trajectory his poetics have followed over more than two decades.
    DiPalma's poetry is a carefully chiselled creation of experience
    that is at once aural, tactile, and visual. He composes with
    what Jackson Mac Low has described as "Precision and surprise
    and no nonessentials. Gists and Piths."

____Arkadii Dragomoschenko. XENIA (paper, list price $12.95)
    "XENIA is an eclectic book, flashing many moods and rhetorics
    that will deepen and broaden [Dragomoschenko's} appear and
    perhaps excite further interest in the once hidden Russian
    avant-garde," observed THE VILLAGE VOICE SUPPLEMENT when this,
    his second collection in English, first appeared. Since that
    time Dragomoschenko has been recognized internationally as
    one of the most important post World War II poets, and his
    linguistic experimentation hailed as a major poetic achievement.
    Despite the hard conditions of contemporary Russian culture,
    he has continued to live in St. Petersburg, the source of much
    of his poetic energy. Translated by Lyn Hejinian and Elena
    Balashova.

____Gloria Frym. BY EAR  (paper, list price $9.95)
    This book can be read as a long poem, bound by narrative and by
    the imperatives of form; each of its sections and each of the
    poems that constitute the book are complete in themselves. Andrei
    Codrescu has remarked of Frym's writing: "Frym is one of the
    finest practitioners of the prose poem." BY EAR demonstrates her
    mastery of this challenging form.

____Charley George. SUNDAY'S ENDING TOO SOON (paper, list price $10.95)
    Throughout the 1970s Charley George was active in the Boulder,
    Colorado scene, which included Ed Dorn, Jack Collum, Allen Gins-
    berg, Anne Waldman, Reed Bye and many others. Within that group
    he was recognized as a significant poet, and he gave numerous
    readings, taught creating writing, and published in some forty
    magazines. But George was also (of necessity) a business man, a
    financial analyst for IBM and a jewelry manager for Neiman-Marcus--
    all of which stole time from his art. Then suddenly in 1988 he
    died, at the age of 47, of a heart attack. His poetic legacy is
    this beautiful volume of poetry, writing not to be missed.

____ Peter Glassgold. BOETHIUS: THE POEM ON THE CONSOLATION OF
     PHILOSOPHY. (paper, list price $10.95)
     Surely one of the most ususual books of poetry ever written,
     Glassgold's BOETHIUS is like no other work in English, a
     translation out of the Latin into diverse historical Englishings,
     this work is a kind of "patascholarship" similar to Glassgold's
     HWAET!, which translated modern and contemporary poetry back
     into Old English. Here he has overlaid various Old, Middle, and
     Modern English translations of the great Latin classic, creating
     a sort of sound-collage to the many translations and the influence
     of Boethius on English.

____Charles Bernstein. ROUGH TRADES (paper, list $10.95)
    Charles Bernstein is, simply put, one of the most influential
    and widely-read poets of our age. One of the true masters
    of irony in poetry, Bernstein manages to also infuse each
    poem with an affirmative vision which verges on the utopian.
    Containing famed poems such as "On Time and the Line," "The
    Kiwi Bird in the Kiwi Tree," "Fear of Flipping," and "Blow-
    Me-Down Etude," ROUGH TRADES is, as THE AMERICAN BOOK REVIEW
    proclaimed "an exhilarating and liberating work."

____André du Bouche. WHERE HEAT LOOMS (paper, list price $12.95)
    One of the last of the great modern French poets, du Bouchet's
    work remains largely untranslated, except for a small edition
    of poems by Paul Auster, and now, this brilliant new translation
    by British poet David Mus. An investigation of light and all
    that is associated with it--fire, white, wind, sky, air, sun,
    flame--WHERE HEAT LOOMS is a stunning lyrical collection of
    international importance.

____David Bromige. THE HARBORMASTER OF HONG KONG (paper, list price
    $10.95)
    Bromige's more than 25 books have brought him international
    recognition and awards, including the Watern States Book Award
    in 1988. THE HARBORMASTER is one of his wittiest and most
    profound books, a celebration of language in its personal, social,
    political relations. "Dear / me, an appointment on the far /
    insists, and in these fists / flower all the meals who / walked
    us to this well."

____Michael Coffey. ELEMENOPY (paper, list price $10.95)
    LIBRARY JOURNAL wrote "[Coffee] is a kind of Dadaist or 'dropster
    punster,' as he calls himself, delighting in all sorts of verbal
    pyrotechnics, always favoring the 'word over reason,' ...[This work
    is] replete with puzzles and pleasures." These poems' "energy is
    invigorating: if the possibilities for forms and kinds of re-
    lationships in language are endless, then so are our own," wrote
    PUBLISHERS WEEKLY.

____Norma Cole. MY BIRD BOOK [Littoral Books] (paper, list price $9.95)
    Published by Littoral Books of Los Angeles, which Sun & Moon Press
    distributes, MY BIRD BOOK represents Cole's charting of a world
    where nature and artifice intermingle. "Parabola leads to fable,
    country as theater, history as scent," "Once we might have sworn
    we'd met these words before," notes Michael Palmer. "This extra-
    ordinary gathering proves otherwise."

____Clark Coolidge. THE CRYSTAL TEXT (paper, list price $11.95)
    Reviewing this book upon its original publication, Bernadette
    Mayer wrote: "In a world where people are perforce cut off from
    the mystical cosmic and sublime aesthetic every day, the works
    Clark Coolidge...provide for us the beauty of some of the
    intersitial stuff that might weave a perception to change
    the world back together." One of the most influential of
    American poets, Collidge is well known for this collection and
    the numerous others which have helped to change the face of
    American poetics.

____Charles O. Hartman and Hugh Kenner. SENTENCES (paper, list price
    $9.95)
    The child of the playfully perverse marriage of a 19th century
    grammar school book and a contemporary computer technology,
    SENTENCES is a surprising lyrical romp. The noted literary
    scholar and poet Charles O. Hartmann discovered a book titled
    SENTENCES FOR ANALYSIS AND PARSING, which was used at the Thayer
    Street Grammar School in Providence, R.I.  Hartmann took this
    book to legendary critic Hugh Kenner, and together they ran it
    through the TRAVESTY computer program developed by Kenner and
    Joseph O'Rourke. They ran that result through the DIASTEXT program,
    based on the "diastic" writings of poet Jackson Mac Low. The
    result is the wonderfully eccentric book, an inspired collaboration
    between technology and human literacy.

____Fanny Howe. THE LIVES OF A SPIRIT (cloth, list price 10.95)
    Composed in what the author describes as "a state of waiting-
    for-God," a state in which the mind is passavid and yet
    alert, in which everything matters, and there is no escape--
    THE LIVES OF THE SPIRIT is a book of expectation, a kind
    of contemporary gospel. This book is central to the writings
    of the major poet and fiction writer, Fanny Howe.

____Benjmain Hollander. THE BOOK OF WHO ARE WAS (paper, list price
    $10.95)
    San Francisco poet Benjamin Hollander explores, through a negotiation
    with poets of the past and present such as Paul Celan, Edmond
    Jabes, and Anne-Marie Albiach, how to "project memory on stage."
    Recognizing poetry as a theatrical field, a perfomance so to speak,
    THE BOOK OF WHO ARE WAS contemplates the process of poetic
    creation in which it is actually the reader's or spectator's
    memory that is projected upon the stage or text. As Jordan
    Davis observed in THE BOSTON BOOK REVIEW: "What is striking in
    his [Hollander's] poetry is his gift for associated concepts
    the way other poets associate words. ...Hollander is most
    himself when he writes others words."

Subject:      20C. Literature Conference

Since this annual conference at the U of Louisville has been mentioned
on the list a couple of times recently, it seems the right moment for me
to post my annual invitation to send stuff. All the information you need
(deadlines, etc.) is on the conference
website:www.edu/a-s/cml/xxconf/call99.html

We have a creative and a critical keynote (forgive the eminently
deconstructible shorthand terms here!) every year, usually one or two
"special guests," plus a full program of critical panels and poetry /
fiction readings. Robert Creeley is this year's creative keynote; we're
working on Donna Haraway for the critical. I don't direct the conference
but I am heavily involved at the level of getting speakers, reading
proposals, compiling panels, etc. What this means in practice is that
it's been a fairly Poetics-list-friendly event in past years, and a lot
of list-folks have come. I read critical proposals (read blind); you
might as well know in advance that creative submissions go to a rather
more conservative group of readers who operate by pretty "mainstream"
criteria (just so's you don't get your hopes too high).

Deadline (slightly flexible) for submissions is Oct. 1, and the
conference takes place the last weekend in February.

Elsewise: like Herb Levy, I'll be in NYC end of Sept. (Sat. 9/26,
actually) and would also like to hear of any goings-on there. Thanks.

>   The PEN May Be Mighty, but in Mexico It Gets Bodyguards
>
>   By Molly Moore
>   Washington Post Foreign Service
>   Monday, September 7, 1998; Page A17
>
>   MEXICO CITY-For nine months, Homero Aridjis, a Mexican poet and
>   international spokesman for freedom of expression, has not stepped out
>   of his house without the bodyguards that shadow him everywhere: to
>   poetry readings, to lunch with friends, even to walk his German
>   shepherd.
>
>   Now, the telephone warnings that prompted the Mexican government to
>   assign guards to the president of PEN International -- a global
>   writers' organization -- have escalated with new and more chilling
>   death threats that reflect a pattern of increasing violence against
>   Mexican writers and journalists.
>
>   "Despite the enormous political opening in the last two years, it is
>   still extremely dangerous to be a journalist in Mexico," said Jorge
>   Zepeda, president of the Society of Journalists, one of two new
>   Mexican watchdog organizations recently created to assist journalists
>   and publicize attacks against them.
>
>   Many journalists argue that it is the growing independence and power
>   of the Mexican media -- fed partially by reforms in Mexico's longtime
>   one-party political system -- that has provoked the surge in attacks
>   and threats against journalists and photographers in the past two
>   years. Once largely pawns of the government, many newspapers and
>   magazines are professionalizing their staffs and pursuing aggressive
>   investigations of drug cartels and official corruption.
>
>   In the last 16 months, four journalists have been killed in Mexico in
>   job-related slayings. Scores have been physically attacked, threatened
>   or intimidated, making the period one of the most violent for
>   journalists here in a decade, according to the New York-based
>   Committee to Protect Journalists. In 1997, threats against journalists
>   were up 55 percent over the previous year with 187 assaults, threats
>   and acts of intimidation, Mexico's Network for the Protection of
>   Journalists reported.
>
>   The attacks have been waged by drug cartels, corrupt law enforcement
>   officials and old-style political bosses, according to Zepeda, who
>   said his organization is attempting to "convince Mexican society that
>   an attack against a journalist is an attack against the whole society
>   and its right to be well-informed."
>
>   Many of the attacks appear to have been related to the journalists'
>   aggressive reporting. Benjamin Flores Gonzalez, editor of the
>   newspaper La Prensa in San Luis Rio Colorado, a town on the border
>   with the United States, was gunned down and died on the front steps of
>   his office last July, the target of drug traffickers angered by his
>   unflinching coverage. A Mexico City journalist was murdered last year
>   and five others abducted, reportedly by police who resented their
>   coverage of corruption.
>
>   Mexican authorities have made few arrests in such cases. The telephone
>   threats received by Aridjis -- one of Mexico's best-known writers and
>   a frequent government critic -- have been particularly troubling to
>   journalistic organizations because of his high-profile position as
>   president of PEN International, the prestigious London-based
>   organization of poets, novelists and other writers.
>
>   "Homero Aridjis becomes a lightning rod because of his visibility,"
>   said Joel Simon of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
>
>   "We suspect that whoever is behind these calls is trying to inhibit
>   Mr. Aridjis' activities as a writer, International PEN president, and
>   an editorial page columnist," the New York-based PEN American Center
>   wrote in a letter to Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo last week.
>   "This latest death threat forms part of a disturbing pattern; previous
>   threatening phone calls also occurred within weeks of a public
>   appearance by or press interview with Mr. Aridjis regarding human
>   rights in Mexico and contemporary dangers faced by writers."
>
>   Aridjis, 58, said he doesn't know who is behind the threats. The first
>   was left on his answering machine at his Mexico City home within hours
>   of a telephone interview with a Washington Post reporter in which he
>   discussed a series of grisly kidnappings in the Mexican capital by a
>   gang that sliced an ear off its victim and sent it to the victim's
>   family as proof of the abduction. The telephone call was made last
>   November from The Post's Mexico City bureau to New York City, where
>   Aridjis was visiting relatives.
>
>   The next morning a voice on his answering machine warned, "Soon you
>   will die like dogs. . . . I'm going to cut your ears off." Aridjis
>   said he assumes that Mexican authorities eavesdropped on the
>   conversation and that the information then somehow found its way to
>   the kidnappers or their associates.
>
>   When asked if Mexican government agencies routinely tap journalists'
>   telephones, one administration official replied, "It wouldn't surprise
>   me if the telephones of some journalists were sometimes tapped."
>
>   Mexican authorities were concerned enough by the threat that they
>   dispatched three bodyguards to the airport to meet Aridjis when he
>   returned here.
>
>   Just after midnight on Aug. 17, Aridjis received another message
>   threatening him as well as his two adult daughters, who were visiting
>   from the United States. "You'll be sorry. . . . You're going to die
>   very soon," the caller said.
>
>   "This kind of intimidation creates a climate of uncertainty, a culture
>   of fear," Aridjis said. "These threats go against freedom of
>   expression in Mexico."
>
>   He described the threats as a "psychological intimidation" that is
>   affecting his writing, as well as his everyday activities. "Our life
>   has changed," he said. "Everyone looks like a suspicious person."
>
>   The PEN American Center and the Committee to Protect Journalists noted
>   that Aridjis had recently spoken out about lack of respect for freedom
>   of expression in Mexico at an Ottawa conference on "The Artist and
>   Human Rights."
>
>   "We are quite worried and taking these threats seriously," said a
>   spokesman for Zedillo. "We will try to do as much as possible to
>   help."

That would be a very interesting conference.  I fear that I'll be working way

7 September l998

Dear Alan

SEveral years ago I was an invited guest at your conference to read either my
poems or my translations from the French of Prevert  (probably both) but I
wonder whether your staff may be interested in my reading from my new
collection of fiction (out late September) called The Radiant ABsurdity of
Desire.  It was just reviewed wonderfully in Publishers Weekly (August l7,
l998) and has exceptional blurbs on its back cover from the English critic
(and senior editor of the New Republic ) James Wood as well as from Alan
Sillitoe and the trranslator and theater director Barbara Bray.

If you are not the person for the creative reader selection, please be kind
enough to show this letter to the proper person.  And good luck to you!

Sincerely

Harriet Zinnes

There is an article debunking this study in salon magazine
(www.salonmagazine.com).  It makes some of the obvious critiques that
might have already occured to most of us webizens. It appears to be a
classic "before and after" study:  have some people fill out
questionnaires, give them computers and access to the web, and then give
them the same survey after a predetermined time. The results were not even
that significant statistically speaking. Also, there was apparently no
control group. (e.g. give another group free Faulkner novels or Silliman
poems, or force them to listen to Talk of the Nation every day, or any
number of other activities; THEN compare.)

Or else simply give a control group the same questionnaire after two
months, after having done nothing in particular.  Maybe some portion of
the population will get depressed anyway because of some other factor
(cloudy Pittsburgh weather, vicissitudes of the Steelers or Pirates,
etc...).  It wouldn't have to be a very significant portion to match the
result of this badly flawed study.

In 1992 I was in Guatemala, where those identified as indigenes (indio is a
slur, india has among its informal meanings prostitute) in a population
almost all of which is native genetically are only the practitioners of the
aboriginal cultures. I neither saw nor heard any discussion of the great
tragedy that the "discovery" was for native peoples. Instead, I was shocked
by signs all over the non-indigene parts of the country proclaiming the
five hundredth anniversary of the introduction of the road to salvation.
Talk about a conquest.

Harriet --

        Would the Alan Sillitoe be the same as wrote "Loneliness of the
Long Distance Runner", and who along with Philip Larkin and Seamus Heaney
populated my young, impressionable years? (You only need answer the first
prt of that question.) I always had a horrible suspicion that he had rung
up the curtain and joined the choir invisible, along with beloved Larkin,
and, living in the States now, I've had trouble coming by evidence to the
contrary. From your comment, it appears he is still reading. Is he still
writing?

it's annual -- every february.  alan doesn't "run" it per se but is on the
organizing committee and therefore accepts papers, gets excellent poets to
read there (haryette mullen last year), and hosts smashing good parties.

Slipping Through the Cracks


Orientation from Herodotus II, 36: "When they write or calculate, instead
of going, like the Greeks, from left to right, they move their hand from
right to left; and they insist, notwithstanding, that it is they who go to
the right and the Greeks who go to the left."

Quotes from Henry George Fischer, The Orientation of Hieroglyphs, Part I.
Reversals, Egyptian Studies II, The Metropolitan Museum of Art:

Of Nefertiti: "Even in the Karnak scenes where she alone worships the Aten
her name is invariably preceded by a reference to Akhenatan in her title
[fig.] 'great wife of the king, whom he loves.' And much more frequently,
her cartouche follows two of his, which are in turn confronted by the
names of Aten [...]. Thus the reversal in her cartouche may indicate that
her husband is the source of her contact with the god. There is, in this
relationship, something of the Miltonian concept: 'Hee for God only, shee
for God in him,' although they shared 'Thir Orisons, each Morning duly
paid.'"

"As shown by his gesture of invocation, the king himself pronounces the
offering formula in front of him, all of which is oriented as he is, ex-
cept for the name of the divine recipient."

"Quite possibly, in view of the adjacent juxtaposition displayed by the
adjacent caption, 'singing to the harp,' the missing object of the prepo-
sition was thought to be supplied by the opposed representation of danc-
ing, with the figures facing left."

"Among the repertory of hieroglyphs in common use, as represented in
Gardiner's Sign List, there are a few exceptions to the usual orientation
- exceptions, moreover, for which no explanation has been offered. The
most perplexing of these are the inverted staff, the sail that is blown
backwards, the reversed boat [...]." [hieroglyphs and references omitted]

What are signs, that they may be stayed upon the head, faced within the
mirror, transformed from outside-in, absolved from inside-out? What is the
materiality of the sign so lost and constituted in these forms, where <
and > are not oppositions but independent, assigned different and variant
encodings? One might reference calligraphy in general, the running style
of kanji, and see Jan Assmann's Ancient Egypt and the Materiality of the
Sign, in Materialities of Communication (eds. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and K.
Ludwig Pfeiffer).

[I come towards you. I approach you. I leave by the moon. I go from the
cave. The world goes with me. Your sight bedazzles me. How can I return
when your sight is imprinted on mine, eye to eye?]

What is the history of the sign and token, from Sumerian tabulations and
clay impresses - through the pressure of edged reeds, rock incisions,
brush and penstrokes? I've spoken repeatedly about these elements; one
might also consider a _wavering hieroglyphic_ in which each and every sign
might face one or another direction, in relation to portent, to the divin-
atio at work as the superstructure breaks loose from the world, recuper-
ates the word as construct of the gods.

"In two Old Kingdom tomb chapels, where the owner of a tomb addresses mem-
bers of his family in order to give them testamentary instructions, the
orientation of his statement is reversed, along with the words that intro-
duce the statement."

Perhaps you break through the lines; I _must_ face you, regardless of the
consequences, regarding your mien, in due regard for your truth in its
place, breaking down the symbolic, transforming it into a certain surplus.

I have no regard for the orientation. I'm always facing you in my dreams.
Making love face to face. Watching. Looking.

Being observed.

"Instead of turning an entire statement around, together with the words
introducing it, the scribes of the Old Kingdom sometimes applied the re-
versal solely to the introductory word [...] 'he says,' following the
speaker's titles and name, in order to point up the fact that the
following words were a direct quotation."

Perhaps I dream your breath, hear your voice coming from the left or
right or within me, an insistence toppling even the vacuity of avatars,
returning your flesh across the queendoms of distributed networks. You
speak so softly, I bend towards you, my ear against your belly. What is
heard in the smooth convexity of spheres, planets, earths.

"Old Kingdom lists of offerings (from Dynasty III onward) are very common-
ly turned so that the hieroglyphs address the person for whom they are in-
tended."

"Here the reversal may have been intended to stress the roundabout orien-
tation of a river that flows south instead of north, as the Nile does."

"Writings of _`kprt_ 'entering and coming forth.'"

Conceivably I do not know whether I am coming or going, towards or away
from you; my hand trembles, the brush goes every whichaway across the
parchment, the signs _spill._ Perhaps I enter you, come forth through a
portal whose destination remains unknown; I am faced left, right, or in-
verted, I lose my way, Virgil nowhere to be found.

"The first two dynasties provide evidence for all three of the basic situ-
ations requiring reversals - confrontation, symmetry, and concordance -
including several uses of hieroglyphic confrontations that are frequent in
later periods, notably the opposition of various elements of the royal
protocol and the opposition of the names of a divinity and of a king."

Facing you, I face myself; joining you, I join myself; becoming you, I no
longer separate such residues, things, stains and processes. Language
wrapping allowing all entering. Direction from the sphere.

Ron, now time enough has passed for us-all to introduce to ourselves
meanings from your books, isn't it time for the Footnoted Ketjak and
Tjanting?  From U.C. Press, or leastways some place they have lots of paper
and ink? You could use footnotes from everyone's suggestions, or supply
them all yourself. I would read this volume before I read F's Wake again.
Hands up all who feel likewise.  David

Interesting post, Alan. Do you know R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz's _The
Temple in Man_? It mentions a 'transparency' inscription on opposite
sides of the same stone in the wall between two rooms at Luxor:

"The wall's characteristic of _transparency_, placing the hieroglyph for
cloths of room 12 in the symbol for 'box of cloths' represented in room
5, would suffice to establish a relationship between the symbols for
cloths and the olfactory bulb. To this is added the characteristic of
what weaving represents as a symbol--that is to say, the _interlacing of
threads_, just as the nerves are interlaced so as to make perceptible
the contacts of the individual with the environment. Thus, we frequently
find the symbol for cloths in these three secret sanctuaries.
   Figure 42 shows clearly what I am suggesting here. The olfactory
bulb, with the olfactory tract splitting in two, constitutes an organ
whose image is identical to the symbol for cloths...." (103).

The approach to the temples of Egypt as detailed mappings of human
anatomy recalls the Eassons' discussion of Blake's _Milton_ as modeled
on the physiology of the optical system.

Queries:
1.I'm looking for Kristeva's essay entitled "The Poet and the Sun." Could
someone inform me where i can find it?
2. I understand Rothenberg has an essay on Bloom. Does anyone know where it is
located?
3.I'm not sure about this, but i heard Rothenberg is giving a reading in NYC
soon. Is this true? If so, where & when?
4.Does anyone know the publication plans for Mina Loy's long poem (don't know
the title)?

Much appreciated,

Here are a couple of possibilities for "Poet and the Sun".  there's a brief
chapter in Tales of Love (1983, 1987 in English) titled "Bataille and the Sun,
or the Guilty Text".
Or maybe you're thinking about her book Black Sun?  Or maybe I'm missing the
boat and someone else will clue us in.
Randy
backchannel if either of these are what you are looking for and you want more
details

Not sure where -- Poetry Project, most likely.

On Tuesday 15 September there will be a reading around the 2nd volume of
POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM at 7:30 p.m. at the Astor Place Barnes & Noble,
with Rothenberg, myself, Bernstein, Andrews, Tarn, Vicu=F1a, Weinberger &

____Ted Greenwald. WORLD OF MOUTH (paper, list price $8.95)
    Ted Greenwald is a major American poet, straddling influences
    from both the New York School Poetry and "Language" writing.
    This is one Greenwald's most important collections. As Bruce
    Andrews wrote of it, upon its original publication. "This is
    language, direct."

____Dennis Phillips. ARENA (paper, list price $10.95)
    Phillips' third book of poetry places the reader in the rec-
    ognizable terrain of the West -- both the West of the once-
    dominant mythos of European tradition and the final diffusion
    of that mythos at the edge of the North American continent. In
    this "arena" civilization battles itself: "The ocean is rough
    in a spot / where tractors and earthmovers / herd strings of
    men. / It is a foreign country. / They build or destroy the
    street."

____Douglas Messerli. MAXIMS FROM MY MOTHER'S MILK/HYMNS TO HIM
    Through the two matched sequences of poets of this, Messerli's
    fourth book of poetry, the author probes the dialogue between
    male and female, wife and husband, mother and father, the
    masculine and feminine psyches of his own being.

____Gil Ott. THE YELLOW FLOOR: POEMS 1978-1983 (paper, list price 6.95)
    Beautiful lyrics that mix song and sentiment in fresh ways by
    Philadelphia poet Ott. "held at my / perimeter / that is the force
    of my / desire / sun / weaving of branches / the larger body /
    that is."

____Tom Mandel. LETTERS OF THE LAW (paper, list price $10.95)
    Tom Mandel focuses on the notion of "law" in both the spiritual
    and social senses. Mixing religious fables and folktales, personal
    lyrics, social commentary, and songs of sorrow and joy, Mandel
    interweaves the laws that encompass each one of us in our
    searches for meaning in our lives.

____Clarence Major. SOME OBSERVATIONS OF A STRANGER AT ZUNI IN
       THE LATTER PART OF THE CENTURY (paper, list price $9.95)
    These poems by poet and novelist Clarence Major, were inspired
    by his time with the Zuni Indians and by the memories of stories
    told by his grandparents of the Indians of his own ancentry.

____Nick Piombino. POEMS (paper, list price $8.95)
    The 31 poems of this collection demonstrate Piombino's commitment
    to and his experience with a language that maps a path of the
    speaker's "person need to articulate his perceptions." Piombino's
    language, in the context of his poetics, acts as "prognostication,
    presage, sign."

____Tom Raworth. ETERNAL SECTIONS (paper, list price $9.95)
    One of British poet Raworth's most important collections, the
    writing of this book is at once narratively based and is radically
    disjunctive, a writing that at every moment seems to be pushing
    away from the line previous but suddenly snaps back into a logical
    whole and transforms the meaning and the reader's experience.

____Martha Ronk. STATE OF MIND (paper, list price $10.95)
    The poets of STATE OF MIND are in transit from one state of mind
    to another as geographies (especially Californian) slide into
    states of mind, statements of "fact" into memory or metaphor.
    A brilliant work from an excellent poet.


More to come later today.

Anne Carson, because published in the US is an "American" poet, but there's
no mention of Daphne Marlatt, Lisa Robertson, so many others. So it goes,
especially for Canadian poets published only by small Canadian presses, I
guess...

Dear David:

The Student server is up now, and I see, late in the day, that Araby
has been taken down. OK. But before I go home with all my busted
illusions, may I ask you one last virtual tough-guy question:  Dude,
how do you do that?

For in one tent you are "The Blades of Glass Whirling and Warning
Cannibal Who Eats The Wife for Dessert" and then next tent (voila!)
you are "The Sad and Aggrieved Elephant Man."

In the gone and melodramatic game of youth you cede the victory to
me; in the greater game of the postmodern ping-pong, I cede the
victory, hats off, to you. For in the latter, who can return a
Champion's shot that starts on the table and then rockets bizarrely
backwards into the gallery at the Champion's back? May I say Bravo
along with the rest? May I say, stunned and admiring, that "you've
earned it"? (Sorry, I see I've asked you more than one question. I
really don't mean them as tough-guy serves or returns-- just a
paddle, now, making whooshing sounds in the carnival air.)

But please, no matter what, keep the book. I really hadn't thought
about the blurb thing for a long time. You were asked way back then
because I felt you were one freak of a poet. Still do. But now book
is dead. Dead, dead, dead. Too late, too late...

Oh, well!!!

And maybe I'll see you at Orono. May we both say, "Pleased to make
you acquaintance," then sit down together, have a beer, talk about
our families, and suck on the insect-like legs of lobsters with all
our might.

love,
Kent, "The Camel Boy"

On at least one of her books, Anne Carson's complete "biography" is "Anne
Carson lives in Canada."  Which makes the "American" designation
particularly odd.

My hand is up.
I wrote a long chapter on Sunset Debris, Ketjak (I have “Y’—ordered it in the
nick of time, I guess—what IS a “nick of time”?), Tjanting, and Paradise in a
dissertation that is appropriately buried in the basement of my grad school’s
library.  One of its readers was the occasionally-vilified-on-this-list Ron
Wallace (who is pretty much a nice guy, as I remember him), who signed the diss
while dissing the topic with “you haven’t convinced me to read any of this
stuff” (it was clearly a powerful and convincing piece of scholarship).  A
challenge issued by Eli Goldblatt (to drop another name familiar to some people
on this list) inspired me to read the books that led to my dissertation, so
blame him for this post (I had thought I would work on--get this--Galway
Kinnell when I started grad school).  I also post for the self-indulgent
purpose of having someone besides the four members of my dissertation committee
read this stuff (in fact, I am not convinced they read it) that I had so much
fun figuring out.
    While in my first fulltime faculty job, I offered a colloquium on langpo to
a department that had never heard of langpo (the liberal arts minor leagues)
and used Sunset Debris (which is ecriture feminine, by the way—astonishing the
things that get into that 20th C. conference) as a central part of the
presentation.  I explained how one intention of the text, according to the
author in some interview published somewhere, was to impose upon the reader the
violence of which language is capable.  One of my colleagues took the book to
the county jail, where he was working with inmates, and he reported to me that
the inmates found that violence in the text and felt that it was like their
sense of having been fucked over (an appropriate rather than offensive choice
of words, given the text) by their worlds.  That, for me, was evidence for my
belief that langpo works outside the overeducated, underemployed audience (see
“A hopeful note?”, whatever its irony) (where do I get this idea of audience
from?—I am sure RS wrote this once, but I can’t remember where.  In any case, a
pretty good reason for an ABD person to get interested) for which it was
intended.
    As for those footnotes, or at least the sorts of minutia that make for
footnotes (stop reading now if such minutia bore you), here are some of mine,
though perhaps not quite what DB has in mind.  I used the minutia to support
some argument but the real point for me was just figuring out this stuff.   I
actually counted all of the sentences in Ketjak (I gave up on Tjanting, at
least to a point).  This counting gave me great pleasure (“Gaiety transfiguring
all that dread”—my answer to an earlier “Huh?”), strange as that might be (my
greatest pleasure in McGwire’s 61 is that he hit it on his father’s 61st
birthday, not that he hit it—if only his father’s birthday would have been June
1st, I would have taken even greater pleasure, and the pitching in the league
would have been really bad).  So here are my footnotes unburied from the
library basement for anyone who is interested, pretty much lifted whole from
the dissertation, where they weren't footnotes, though maybe they should have
been.

Silliman describes the form of Ketjak in an interview with Larry McCaffery and
Sinda Gregory:
  ""Ketjak" itself is a musical form--it's the Balinese version of the Ramayana
myth, with as many as two hundred singers.  It's essentially a choral form, and
I was interested in the concept of the cumulative effort. . . . .
 Ketjak is structured so that every paragraph has twice as many sentences as
the previous paragraph, with every other sentence being a repetition of the
sentences (in exactly the same order) from the previous paragraph."  (247, 248)

He is lying or at best telling a partial truth.  Three times he leaves out
sentences that appeared in the previous paragraph, once from the fourth to
fifth paragraph, and twice from the eleventh to the twelfth paragraph, where
both omissions are on the same page (80).  These omissions break down the
structure so that the fifth paragraph, which should have sixteen sentences
according to the given method of paragraph extension, has ONLY FOURTEEN
SENTENCES..
     Twice he places two sentences side by side in successive paragraphs, the
first time by simple repetition: "Modal rounders.  A sequence of objects,
silhouettes, which to him appears to be a caravan of fellaheen, a circus,
dromedaries pulling wagons bearing tiger cages, fringed surreys, tamed
ostriches in toy hats, begins a slow migration to the right vanishing point on
the horizon" (5, 6); and the second time by making two sentences into one: "A
learned solitude, constantly in the head looking out.  Constantly waking, new
day" (33) becomes "A learned solitude, in the head looking out, constantly
waking, new day" (63).  He also occasionally inserts two new sentences between
sentences from the preceding paragraph.  In one span of insertions (61-64) in
the twelfth and final paragraph (48-93), the inserted sentences have appeared
before as the seventh paragraph (5-7).

    Here’s another note re the first quoted paragraph from the interview quoted
above.
     This community-centered production--"the concept of cumulative effort"
noted by Silliman in his comments on the form of this poem--sets up a metaphor
for reading contained in the title of the work.  "Ketjak" is a Balinese dance
with a basis in traditional forms of dance and choral music, but the form
itself was invented for a 1931 movie through the collaboration of Balinese
dancers and Walter Spies, a Russo-German artist and musician (Ramseyer 239).
The variable and collaborative nature of this and other Balinese dances
suggests a method of reading Silliman's Ketjak.  Beryl de Zoete in
collaboration with (how nicely that fits the discussion) Walter Spies gives
what could be a model for the communal production of Silliman's Ketjak in
noting the nature of Balinese dance, its
  "constant changes and exchanges which are always going on, out of a native
impulse to create and experiment.  Balinese dance is not static or uniform, and
there are almost as many ways of doing one thing as there are villages which do
it. . . . The traditional framework remains, but the elements have a different
emphasis and perhaps a different distribution."  (44)
 Dancing in Bali can be a product of any person; "just as one hour does not
stand out from another with insistent individuality, nor does the activity
which we call dancing.  A dancer may be a fisherman, a wood-carver, a
goldsmith" (5).  (More Yeats here.)   It might be pertinent to recall Gertrude
Stein's assertion that "everybody has to be a poet" ("Poetry and Grammar" 237).

     I may have taken the significance of the title of Ketjak further than
Silliman intends it, but such taking may very well be what he intends.  He has
asserted that "a text is equally situated through the life of the reader" as
through the life of the author.  He writes with this recognition firmly in view
so that his works
  "come into play only in the presence of the collaborator who opens the text.
It is through this interaction, the reading process, that a work can be said to
exist in the world, a complex event with multiple actors, and an event which
changes with each reading."  ("Interview" with Tom Beckett 46)

     The constantly developing existence of the text "in the world" reflects
the metaphor of the ketjak, which varies from performance to performance and
place to place and does not distinguish individually between performers: "to
seek a consecutive theme in the wandering voices, the cracked strings and
wailing cries, the various fragments of solo which occur during the dance, is a
vain quest" (de Zoete and Spies 85).

Minutial Tjanting:
     For the first parts of alternating paragraphs, the sentences new to the
paragraphs occur between two sentences from the previous odd or even paragraph,
which is similar to the progression of Ketjak except that this insertion goes
on in two different sets of sentences.  But if this were all that happened to
the paragraphs, the Fibonnacci series would have to be broken and Tjanting
would be a simple doubling of the form of the earlier poem.  Instead, Tjanting
goes beyond Ketjak by completing the paragraphs with sentences entirely new to
the poem.
     It will be easier to see how this works by looking at the numbers of
sentences that should occur in separate paragraphs of Tjanting.  The twelfth
paragraph has (or should have) 144 sentences.  These sentences should be
doubled in the fourteenth paragraph by inserting a new sentence between each of
the existing sentences.  They are doubled in such a way, but that gives
paragraph fourteen a total of 288 sentences, far short of the 377 needed to
keep the series intact.  In order to follow the progression of the series,
Silliman adds 89 sentences to the end of the paragraph.
       This goes on until the nineteenth paragraph, which, being the last
paragraph, needs 987 sentences to complete the series, sentences that have no
space in which to be repeated (this paragraph stretches across 86 pages and
should contain 4181 sentences, though I have not counted--my obsession with
counting has its limits).  The first of these 987 unrepeated sentences is "An
end to rewriting" (191).  I find this hilarious.

    Tjanting further demonstrates this expansion, and its doubling of Ketjak,
by including sentences from the earlier work, usually with significant
alterations.  "A tenor sax is a toy" (Ketjak 4) and "A tenor sax is a weapon"
(Ketjak 5) become "Shit is a toy" and "Shit is a weapon" (T 51).  "Revolving
door" (Ketjak passim) revolves into Tjanting as "Revolving dork" (156) and
"Revolting door" (182).  "A day of rain in the middle of June" (Ketjak 4ff.)
becomes, surprisingly, "A day of rain in the middle of June" (Tjanting 100),
which serves the purpose of making the ordinary remarkable, exactly what
Silliman's "gleeful specificity" does for all the odd but ordinary details he
brings into his poems.  He does return to the usual, however, when he again
(mis)quotes the sentence as "A day of June in the middle of rain" (Tjanting
183), which has its own queer referential sense, the inverse (almost) of which
is the reference of the original sentence.
     The "embeddedness" suggested by one of Silliman's puns surfaces not only
when Tjanting incorporates individual sentences from Ketjak into its paragraphs
but when it includes a whole paragraph from the earlier poem.  Silliman embeds
the fifth or the sixth paragraph of Ketjak--which paragraph it is depends on
how you look at the embedding--in the nineteenth paragraph of Tjanting, making
it a part of Tjanting by performing the same sort of mutations on the sentences
lifted from the earlier work as he has on the sentences original (this term is
used advisedly, with an awareness of how Silliman uses many found and allusory
sentences) to the later work.  Though he may repeat nearly the same words, he
reorders them, sometimes to the point that their reference is completely
different.

     I also did a limited survey comparing percentages of various grammatical
structures in the “sentences” of Ketjak and Tjanting, using four
categories—complete sentences, noun phrases, other grammatical phrases, and
ungrammatical constructions.  There was a point to doing this, but I have
forgotten what it was.  I am glad to have done it, however.  I counted these
two, among other strangenesses, as complete sentences: "The way new stretches
shoot out." and "Forms crab forth."  Transfiguration.

     I could plum the structure of Paradise a bit, but too much is enough, and
besides, the most beautiful of all the carpenter’s tools is the level.  I will
wonder if the reference to Ron Hanson hasn't been outdated for a few years
now.  Who should it be in the next edition?  I can't remember.  Can anypne
help?

     Finally (finally!), two questions:  Is Silliman (Paradise) quoting
Hejinian (My Life) or vice-versa or are they both quoting someone else with
“For those who love to be astonished”?  Who has A-X and Z--what sort of
alphabet would that be?

No, Ron, you are not alone in remarking that one Mike Davidson caught #61.
However, unless #62 is caught by a Michael Palmer, it isn't a big
coincidence.

There are several Michael Davidsons in the halls of fame/notoriety. Our MD
told me that there is another MD who is a writer of (closet homosexual?)
novels. (That is maybe correct--it's been a while since we had that
conversation). I think our MD's wife-to-be stumbled upon him while in a
library search for the other MD.

Now we have a 3rd MD to deal with, because this #61 dude bears little
resemblance to the Adonis scholar & poet of San Diego. In fact, he looks
his complete opposite. But both have good hand-eye coordination? No, this
guy didnt catch it, he won a scramble for it under some seats.

Btw, has anyone else remarked the ubiquity of McGwire facial hair
arrangements throughout both leagues? Not ginger, always, of course. Last
night a Giant pitched to a Padre and both wore McGwires (sable), while the
ondeck man wore one as well.

Friends,

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the issue of whether public
funding to an artist can be linked with the idea of whether the art
is decent. After the Robert Mapplethorpe scandal not so long ago,
Congress passed a law that for an artist's art to receive public money
via the National Endowment for the Arts, it must be deemed decent.
On NPR Morning Edition this morning, Nina Tottenberg said that if the
Supreme Court supports Congress, it is in effect the end of NEA. Then,
there's the question of Congressional funding: Funding for NPR / NEA
& PBS.

This petition is being passed around the Internet. Please add your
name to it so that funding can be maintained for the NEA, NPR & PBS.
Please keep this petition rolling. Do not reply to me. Please sign and
forward to others to sign. If you prefer not to sign please
send to the e-mail address indicated or return to me. Thanks.
This is being forwarded to several people at once to add their names to
the petition. It won't matter if many people receive the same list as
the names are being managed. This is for anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a
worthwhile expenditure of $1.12/year of their taxes, a petition
follows.

If you sign, please forward on to others. If not, please don't kill it
send it to the email address listed here: wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu.

Petition: funding. In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce
spending costs and streamline their services, some government
officials believe that the funding currently going to these programs is
too large a portion of funding for something which is seen as not
worthwhile.

Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS equal $1.12 per
person per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts equals
$0.64 a year.

A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated that 76% of
Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to national defense
and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for federal funding.
Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations committees each have 13
subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies. Each
subcommittee passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year is
to have each bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year, which is
October 1. The only way that our representatives can be aware of the
base of support for PBS and funding for these types of programs is by
making our voices heard. Please add your name to this list and forward
it to friends if you believe in what we stand for. This list will be
forwarded to the President of the United States, the Vice President
of the United States, and Representative Newt Gingrich, who is the
instigator of the action to cut funding to these worthwhile programs.

*If you happen to be the 150th, 200th, 250th, etc.,
signer of this petition, please forward a copy to:
<wein2688@blue.univnorthco.edu. This way we can keep track of the
lists and organize them. Forward this to everyone you know, and help us
to keep these programs alive. Thank you.

NOTE: It is preferable that you SELECT the entirety of this letter and
then COPY it into a new outgoing message rather than simply forwarding
it. Or if option is available, do a SEND AGAIN.

Yeah, it was a pretty varied group to start with.
In Guatemala (I don't know whether this applies more broadly) we have been
adjectified as "estadosunidense." Not real handy to the anglo tongue. How
about "yewessian?"

But contrary to that Delillo rendered circulating simulacra of a Bobby
Thompson desire, the Icon of McGwire History Recording has been encoded,
irradiated, so as to allow for truth in identification. The One True

 In '92, the year she was awarded for the Nobel Peace Prize, I heard Rigoberta
Menchu Tum read a poem.

She noted it was a liturgical offering to the anonymous Guatemalan dead, los
indigenas guatemaltecos. It was said under her breath, on the air, narrowcast,
streaming audio, buffering, as it were.

Since '96 when the "peace accords" with the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional
Guatemalteca were signed those not too dead and not buried too deeply in mass
graves started to return, mostly out of southern mexico.

Talk about a conquest. (cf. also _Our Own Backyard: the US in Central America,
1977-1992_, William LeoGrande, UNC, 1998)

I've lived in various places in Ca. and there are problems at times over
the use of _America,_ since it seems to imply the US - i.e. American
citizens for example. Ca. gets left out. And there is an adj. for the US -
US citizen, for example, albeit somewhat colloquial.

Hurrah and thanks for the minutia (I am re-reading Tristram Shandy in yewessian
astony-ment).
This (below) reminds me Brautigan's chapter in Confederate General from Big Sur
called Counting the Punctuation Marks in Ecclesiastes. Years ago I checked and his
counts were accurate. This is what depressed people did before the internet.

I'd have doubts about this, but I'd like to see the work. I'd also like to
see what the cloth symbol apparently stems from re: say Gardiner.

I'm always amazed, not at the similarities, but at the differences of
origins - looking at cuneiform, hieroglyphics, kanji, and seeing almost no
relationships at all. And the current meanings of the last seem very
twisted compared to their apparent origins (from the accounts I've read -
I know very little kanji by heart). I could see the development of a
meta-syntactics of the sign, working through narratological issues as well
- something that might be applied across the board to different symbolic
systems.

And thank you for the reference - I'll look for it.

yours, Alan

For those who aren't aware, Michael I think inadvertently could be read as
saying that the numbers of the dead had been exaggerated, many of those
claimed as dead having been in exile. Estimates of the dead run between
100,000 and 400,000, almost all Mayans from the highlands. 400 villages
disappeared from the map, many others were combined into the sort of
fortified resettlement villages that the US did so much to popularize
during the Viet Nam war. Large numbers of people took to a life of
scavenging in the forest (these folks had been farmers for millenia) for
years at a time in order to remain invisible to the army and the police. In
a country of enormous potential wealth and enduring grinding poverty over
half the population was reduced to a new level of penury. With an
unemployment rate of 80% a worker lucky enough to get a job in a
maquiladora factory then and now will make $.14 an hour.
Since the peace accords the situation has gotten worse, if anything: the
death squads may no longer be government-sponsored, but they persist. Added
to them are gangs of thugs recruited from the ranks of the disbanded troops
of both sides. Murder and pillage have become more commonplace and less
discriminating. And the poor, "the truly miserable" who make up the bulk of
the population, as a Guatemalan friend put it, continue to starve.

As a token of our throw-away foreign policy, the US, which has a big share
of responsibility for this situation, does nothing. The cold war being
over, Guatemala is no longer a security concern of ours. Toss it out the
window like a used beer can.

I think Mr. Weiss meant this for this list. Because it is true. (It is hard to
estimate in particular the early 80s of Guatemala and the tenure of Efrain Rios
Montt and Ronald Reagan(think percentage of all the dead of all american wars
combined)). But he is right, more, about the situation today. It is world we live
in. Now. You and me and Mark McGwire.)

Well, here's hoping that the one who catches the ball this evening (yes!) will
be named Marianne Moore, the only poet I can think of who actually wrote an
article on the St. Louis Cardinals (in 1968).
Actually, I once published an article on Lou Brock, but I'm nowhere near St.
Louis at this point, unfortunately.  I did see him hit his 38th home run this
season at Busch.
And I hope Sammy Sosa hits one too.  Maybe Lorca can catch it.

Our final posting for the great
Sun & Moon sale

Each book is $4.00 + $1.25 for postage

____Jackson Mac Low FROM PEARL HARBOR DAY TO FDR'S BIRTHDAY
    (paper, list price $10.95)
    Upon its original publication in1982, FROM PEARL HARBOR DAY...,
    representing work written from the 7th of December 1981 to the
    30th of January 1982, was recognized as a significant new direction
    in the writing of noted poet Jackson Mac Low. Although he had
    written disjunction poems since the 1930s, this work evinced a new
    interest, arounds in part by the "Language" poets, in intentional
    methodology, as opposed to his chance-oriented poems, writing he
    continued in BLOOMSDAY (1984) and in PIECES O' SIX (1992, Sun & Moon
    Press). This book is a must for all readers interested in the work
    of Mac Low.

____Joe Ross. GUARDS OF THE HEART (paper, list price $9.95)
    Of the Byron of Manfred were to join forces with the "Language"
    writers, together they might have produced the four astoundingly
    original plays of poetry by the young poet Joe Ross. His is a highly
    romantic work, the writing of a believer in the potential of the
    human mind, a believer in the possibility of knowing truth. But
    Ross's work is also completely contemporary, syncretic and
    disjunctive, revelatory of the constant shift and flux of the
    late 1990s.

____Aaron Shurin. INTO DISTANCES. (paper, list price $10.95)
    In this, his eighth book of poetry, Aaron Shurin continues to explore
    the prose-poem format he began in 1984, a form in which he has
    sought to combine lyric and narrative in a way that reflects in its
    complexities and contraditions the tension between individual per-
    ception and social control; a poetry simulatneously of praise and
    dislocation.

____Giuseppe Steiner. DRAWN STATES OF MIND (paper, $8.95)
    Steiner joined the ranks of the Italian Futuris movement during World
    War I, and contributed poetry to a variety of Futurist journals. But
    in the years to follow Steiner abanonded the Marinettian project
    of "words-in-freedom" because he felt that verbal poetry was in-
    herently limited, due to the inadequate expressive potential of
    words. Pushing Marinetti's work, Steiner first experimented with
    "syllables in freedom," and when these also seemed unmanageable, he
    turned away from verbal expression altogether. These wonderful
    visual poems are remarkably original and fun.

____John Taggart. LOOP (paper, list price $11.95)
    In LOOP, noted poet John Taggart's largest collection to date, the
    poet expands his poetic vistas, probing along lines first laid out
    by the Objectivists, but in a manner all his own. Here is a use of
    poetic repetition that permits us to hear and hear again the rhythms
    of our lives, from childhood to what we describe as adulthood.

____Hannah Weiner. SPOKE (paper, list price $6.95)
    Perhaps this book is the recently deceased Weiner's most important
    book. Certainly, she never saw words in space as clearly as in SPOKE.
    Its sense of energy, humor, and poetic exploration is hard to be
    matched.

____Mac Wellman. A SHELF IN WOOP'S CLOTHING (paper, list price $8.95)
    Mac Wellman is a hero to almost any of the younger playwrights; more
    than anyone of his generation, Wellman forged a new poetic theater
    that has had an enormous impact on contemporary drama. But it is
    important to remember that Wellman is also an incredible poet, as
    crazily divine book reveals.


THERE'S MORE FOLKS AT SUN & MOON.....but that's all for this sale....

I look forward to your orders.

I am hearing conflicting reports in regards to sending petitions over the
net.  I have heard that they are useless, because you actually need a
signiture - and through this medium that is impossible (I think).  Anyway
does anyone know for sure.

Subject:      Fall Readings in Montreal
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Hi, No fixed adDress, a group of Montreal writers dedicated to exploring
new writing practices is holding a series of readings this Fall, so if
you're coming up (or down) this way, don't miss 'em.

Wednesday, September 23:
Lisa Robertson, Vancouver-based poet, author of _Debbie: an Epic_ (New Star
Books and Reality Street Editions). Her work has also been published in
_Out of Everywhere_ and _Moving Borders_.
"someone drags an amazon like a dead
a kneeling amazon a fallen a
mazon an amazon facing
backwards an amazon armed with a word
pulling an amazon treading down an
amazon an amazon with a mounted
amazon from behind by an ama
zon over a fallen amazon an
amazon overcoming striking down"

Introduced by Gail Scott, author of _Main Brides_, a novel (Coach House Pres=
s).

Thursday, October 15:
=46rance Daigle, Acadian novelist, author of several novels, most recently
_1953: chronique d'une naissance annonc=E9e_ and _Pas Pire_ (Editions de
l'Acadie).
with Robert Majzels, author of _City of Forgetting_, a novel (Mercury
Press) and translator of France Daigle's _1953: Chronicle of a Birth
=46oretold_ (House of Anansi).

"For novelists do not live; they grind. They take life apart, revelling in
the sight of its countless components, and then spend sleepless nights
trying to figure out how to breathe life back into this inert matter. And
even if they succeed in putting it all back together, they continue to fret
over whether the machine will be of any use."
from _1953_

and Fredric Gary Comeau, Acadian poet and playwright, author of Ravages
(Editions Perce-Neige).

"la cartographie de cet instinct
nous force a redefinir l'errance
l'image du nord l'hiver toujours present
le corps en attente d'une voix ou d'une lueur
le besoin d'habiter le langage comme lietmotiv
au seuil d'un autre lieu d'un territoire
que nous imaginons mobile"

Thursday, October 29:
Gerry Shikatani, Montreal-based sound poet, author of _Aqueduct_ (Mercury
Press, Underwhich Editions, Wolsak & Wynn).

"(those gestures behind doors)=8A
I can remember then, the precision of that meal=8A Eggs, hot, yet still
liquid and yellow in their sweet warm cream, the tureen to fingers was hot,
I would taste and inhale the odours into me. And the crisp, almost smoke
salt skin of a duck confit in its soft giving sauce, a tableau of pureed
carrots fanned with ridges, and those sweet white potatoes, still vegetable
crisp, speaking of their presence in the earth."

Wednesday, November 18:
Nicole Markotic, Calgary-based poet and fiction writer, author of Minotaurs
and Other Alphabets (Wolsak & Wynn).

"they didn't notice, but "L" and "R" can be versions of the same letter.
can be, to her ear, the same sound. listen, there's a reason, dreams happen
beneath eyelids. there's a pattern, trust me when I say I'm going to sew
buttons on the underside of shirts, read them across ribs"
from _lip service_

Introduced by Erin Mour=E9, poet, author of _Search Procedures_.

Our thanks to the Canada Council and Moveable Type Inc. for financial
support for these readings.

All readings: 8 pm at Bistro 4, 4040 St-Laurent.

The value of a petition is always variable. When I worked as a lobbyist =
for the prison movement in Sacramento in the 1970s, it was standard =
operating procedure for lawmakers to routinely sort incoming mail =
geographically -- in district mail, out of district mail -- the latter =
almost always being pitched without even being read. The major variation =
on that theme was a tripartite one: in district mail, out of district =
mail, in the district of the office I want to run for next mail (state =
senators in Calif. have noticeably larger districts than do members of =
the "lower" house, as do members of congress).=20

Since petitions so often tend not to be sortable on those terms, they =
were always looked at with some suspicion.

Several lawmakers also used a numerical system. A postcard, by virtue of =
the effort demanded, was presumed to indicate that 3 persons in the =
district (and that "in the district" was a constant) felt likewise moved =
on a given issue. An actual letter was presumed to indicate that 9 =
persons felt likewise. Items that had been "pre-written" (like those =
pre-printed post cards that start, Dear Mr. Gingrich) were, by this =
scale, a one. A few pols always knew exactly what the numbers on any =
given bill were in these terms and while it didn't always sway votes -- =
there were a few back then who actually had their own opinions -- it =
sometimes would have an impact, especially in situations where it wasn't =
a "hot button" item.=20

So, petitions tended to be a "one" per signature, but it was/is often =
hard to tell what the district relation of a given signature was, which =
tended to make it even less felt. But it was/is a register of feeling, =
position, voter emotion, etc., and so is taken into consideration.

The problem of the net and petitions right now is two-fold. First, I =
can't tell that you are really you when you sign a petition and I'm even =
fuzzier as to where you live (in my district or otherwise). Second, lots =
of pols, like business execs still, tend to be technology idiots. Think =
of Janet Reno's comment that "I'm not personally acquainted with a PC at =
the moment" in response to a question concerning the Microsoft =
anti-trust case -- this from a woman who has a PC service contract that =
requires 15 minute response time and a 30 minute fix, meaning that =
whoever currently has the Justice Dept contract these days (I used to =
work for a company that had it) has a paid employee basically waiting =
full-time at DOJ headquarters with a system that has last night's backup =
ready to be swapped for Reno's the minute it crashes -- and she doesn't =
even use the machine!

What pols know about the net, all too often, is what they read in the =
media, so they know that it got Hank the Angry Dwarf elected as People =
Magazine's "Sexiest Man Alive" (or whatever that contest was), they know =
about the Ourfirsttime.com scam, they know about the IPOs of Yahoo and =
other internet companies, and that there is a lot of porn out there. So =
they're basically stupid and suspicious -- always a bad combination.

Having said that and with this background, I do tend to sign petitions =
and circulate them. How impactful are they? Never as much as I would =
like, but frankly better than nothing. The real question is what ELSE =
can I, or you, or anyone do to help get the NEA funded or oil companies =
to stop supporting African dictators or whatever. Getting a good person =
elected or a bad one dis-elected has one hell of a lot more impact in =
the long run.

Fire Damages Home of Poet Rita Dove
Filed at 5:18 a.m. EDT=20

By The Associated Press
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A lightning strike sent flames shooting =
through the roof of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Rita Dove's home, =
causing about $250,000 in damage but sparing her original manuscripts.=20

``There is a lot of water damage, but overall we were quite lucky,'' Ms. =
Dove said. ``I really thought ... it was going to burn to the ground.''=20

The fire started with a lightning strike that threw Ms. Dove's husband, =
Fred Viebahn, across a study Monday night. Flames shot through the top =
of the house, destroying the roof and attic.=20

The lightning strike also knocked out power to most of the other houses =
on her street.=20

``I heard a loud, terrible explosion,'' said Ms. Dove, who teaches =
English at the University of Virginia.=20

The fire collapsed part of a ceiling in the two-story wood house, =
injuring three volunteer firefighters. One was being treated at the =
University of Virginia Medical Center for burns, and the other two were =
treated at the scene for scrapes and bruises.=20

Ms. Dove won the 1987 Pulitzer Prize in poetry for her book ``Thomas and =
Beulah.'' She served as the nation's first black -- and youngest -- poet =
laureate from 1993 to 1995.=20

Dear David,

Well I am in New York, every moment I feel like that guy in the Stevie
Wonder song "Living in the City" when he says "New York, just how I
pictured it, skyscrapers and everything."  For me it is "New York, just
like I remembered it, sexy women and beautiful industrial blight,
everywhere."  Because of course I am returning, same apartment same job
same friends.

I thoroughly enjoyed the poem below and am tacking it to my newly put
together and delightlyfully functional office.

love,
Rachel

p.s.  I am getting a chapbook published by G.Sullivan.  In it is a poem
in which I use an email from you in a twisted and misquoted fashion.  I
don't put your name on it.  Would that offend you?  Would you like to
see it and tell me if you are offended?

I don't know--my Pessoa is somewhat damp, anxious and celibate.  But
perhaps we should ask: which heteronym?

As Bernardo Soares, assistant bookkeeper, he wrote:

We should be pure, not to be noble or strong, but to be ourselves . . .

We must abdicate from life in order not to abdicate from ourselves.

Woman is a good source of dreams--never touch her.

Learn to disconnect the ideas of voluptuousness and pleasure . . .
Because nothing is what it is . . .  For that reason you must not touch
anything . . .

Sound & Language announce the launch of a 'writers' book, commissioned from:

            TERTIA LONGMIRE and AARON WILLIAMSON

____________________________________________________________________________=
__

In this book, 'energies of writing' emerge through developing photography
and writing - both as materials and activities - in relation to each other.
Here, the textual is transformed, quarried and disfigured as it re/appears
physically in the image, and vice versa.

The book was realised collaboratively, beyond any definitive role taken by
either of the artist-writers. Similarly, the interplay between written
texts and visual images is non-illustrative, being materially accumulated
through repetition and symbiosis.

Taken together, both elements convey a mercurial ineffability in which
logos and imago converge. The collaborative 'I', postcriptually written-in,
becomes a supplementary, elusively figured 'hook' for this convergence. In
this way, writing generates an energy which not only signifies but is
itself the subject of signification.

-   Tertia Longmire is a writer and visual artist. She has made many
installation pieces, exploring ideas about revelation, concealment and
spatial boundaries, often using found objects and texts. Her books include
'ReFuse' (Text and Image, 1996); and 'The Table Leaks its Object' (Magpie
Press, 1997). She is lecturer in sculpture at Brighton University.

-  Performance artist and writer Aaron Williamson's work is informed by his
experience of becoming profoundly deaf. He has toured extensively in Europe
and North America and recently completed a Doctoral thesis entitled
'Physiques of Inscription' at the University of Sussex. His publications
include 'Cathedral Lung' (1991); and 'A Holythroat Symposium' (Creation,
1993).

-------

A reading - performance will take place at:

ONE IN THE OTHER
1 Tenter Ground (off White's Row)
London E1 (Liverpool Street BR / Tube)

on Wednesday September 30th
8.00pm

This is a free event, copies of the book will be on sale
the event supported by Performance Writing / Eastern Arts Board and
Sound & Language.

The book is available for sale, from October 1st onwards at =A35 (plus p&p)
from  -  85 London Road South. Lowestoft. Suffolk NR33 OAS
(cheques etc made payable to Sound & Language)

see you there

I don't now Pessoa as well as I should.  There is a strange Spanish poet
who does translations, some of which have no originals behind them. Here
is my rough version of Leopoldo Maria Panero's "Imitation of Pessoa"--does
anyone recognize the poem its an imitation of? If it comes from a real
Pessoa poem it might shed light on the whole virginity question:


Love, do not be:  flee from being and let being flee from you
like a dead man, and tell it, don't touch me
like a dead man, let life not plant in me
its animal claw, for
life is a sin, love, do not be
life smells bad, love
do not be for living is a
perpetual flight from that birth that strangers
conspired against your happiness one day, from that
birth that those unknown people
wanted for you and noone could match you
because you are still a virgin, a virgin
like a saint, from life itself:

                                my love, be like me, do not be.


There are also some Trakl translations that I am trying to track down.
I'll post them soon.

mcgwire and sosa seem like great sports, the finest millionaires you want

going to happen) to show us film of maris hitting his record making shot or
some of the hate messages he received for his desecrating the memory of the

Thanks to those of you who pointed out my mistake in listing the
conference site--turns out it's printed incorrectly on our conference
poster (embarrassing mistake!), which is where I copied it from. Anyway,
the correct site address is

http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/cml/xxconf/call99.html

I'd missed out the "louisville" before.

A student of mine needs to know the name of a "prominent" American family,
perhaps politicos or plutos, who can, ostentatiously or otherwise, trace
their origins to the pilgrim fathers.  Any suggestions would be very
welcome.

        Dear me Mr. Kent, the literary character not the man, that was the
trouble! You are created a literary character in your Khartoum letter, just
as I am creating myself Mr. Davood, and Mr. Kent can say anything he wants
to Mr. Davood, and vice versa, if in correct patois. So Mr. Davood is
saying things apparently to Mr. Kent, but really to their audience (o yes,
there is being one) on the Listserv, and Kent Johnson is not to be taken
personally aback. no more should David Bromige cry aloud under the lashes
of Mr. Kent if directed at back of Mr. Davood....On which misnomer, more
later.

 And the things I am created to write cannot be about me, for I do not
exist, so they are about everybody. Everybody is studding at college,
measuring p-word and c-word, where to apply, etc., studding up how the
collect word for harem or marry'm, one of em, old game of hunt & pecker,
saucy gander get saucier goose. Hah!-- Btw, Mr. Kent, since you are so the
expert on the harem, can you say where are mine gone? They sly from me who
sometime did me freak, as Sir Thomas Whynot is compleynting. O lonely me!
How I enjoy to put on the CW vinyl here at the hustele. How are you doing,
goodlookin'? If you see her, send on home to me. When you walk down the
street, my heart falls at your feet. The days and nights are getting
longer. Headed for the creating side of town. I'm nobobdaddy's refining
sugar now. I'm not makin' party out of lovin', just like Muskokees.
Whippoorwhill not being so lonely, since I hear him.

So my mentor Professor Bromige is writing upsetly to his corespondent
Professor Johnson because B feels J broke the wonderfully unspoken rules.
Having superbly done art in Khartoum missives, J ununderstandably turn into
reallife clutch of pointed sticks. So B is saying J is the real
postmodernist ping-pong backwardshot paddle champ, he himself B only one
dismayed discontestant, though flatterned with your plenteous praise and
ever eager for more of the seme thing, though his real motive, he is saying
thru me, is me itself and a possible playmate for me, in the parallel park
situation not the headon tragic mundane, where severeal issues of poetry
today can be shopped if not priceless.

B say moreunder "Davood" is slip of keyboard for "David," me sharing name
at first with him. B is himself an apologist for misunderstanding that I am
of arab world, B saying his rarely laughable broken language is sole result
of himself translating psyche-wise to the London england of his first
schoolings from the californica argot he is writing else to the List
employing, and there is reason being the "Anglo" in "Anglo-Egyptian Sudan"
tripwries old language-injuries into the bargain of outdating political
boarders. Also welcome chance to do bad writing this time with intentions.

Glad indeed to have gotten out of the way of that burden, may I assure you,
Mr. Kent, that if meeting you means having to journey to Khartoum, let us
be meeting
half the way. How a jolly bout the France of the master poet Alan Jennifer
Sondheim--I should liking the overwhelming intellect existence he
foreshadows! Les Cafes Philosophes for us, my friend! With two wine glasses
and an artifacted argument always safely between us, we shall be the very
spirit McGregor and Seltza of St.Louis Germain duh Prez!

I am kissing your feet, David (The Text one, not the One with the Painful
Feet of himself).

Oops! I had instead of been backchanneling such confidence privations!

My spell check suggested treacle for Trakl.  Anyway, this poem is called
"After Trakl (2)" (title originally in English). The poet is Leopoldo
Maria Panero:

"Dark is the brow of the solitary man
wandering through the garden where the stars have died
through the motionless garden where the stars have died:
and a fish in the sky
gleams
showing the path of excrement"

Don't recognize that, but all I have is the Honig/Brown _Poems of FP_
and the prose _Book of Disquiet_.  There are similar lines scattered
throughout but this one seems a bit over the top, even for this
excitable boy.  I could easily be wrong.  Two excerpts from the Ricardo
Reis heteronym and one from Álvaro de Campos:

Lydia, we know nothing. We are strangers
Wherever we may be.

Lydia, we know nothing, We are strangers
Wherever we may live . . .

        *       *       *

Nothing comes of nothing. We are nothing.
Briefly in sun, in air, we postpone
The unbreathable darkness that weighs us down
. . . .
We're stories telling stories, nothing.

        *       *       *

On the road to Sintra, near midnight, at the wheel in the moonlight,
On the road to Sintra, tired of my own fancies,
On the road to Sintra, each moment closer to Sintra,
On the road to Sintra, each moment farther away from myself . . .

  ah one of my CW (Mccoll?) students just submitted a poem called
   "breaker, breaker". I used to have a CB and a paper-route.
   I'm havin' trouble with the teminology but I'm into CB--
   which could stand for Charles Bernstein--one of the first

                       (oh jimmy schuyler jackson 5 ABC)

        70s razor comercial?). he do the police in different...
        " he is the author of three books including COPS..."
   and the smokeys may then there get RACHEL LEVITSKY if she's
    not carful if she's gonna APE that song by Stevie Blind Boy
   Wonder because he gets put in prison for being unwitting FALL guy
   (totally wired?), but then Bill Louima plunged in and told me
     that my last book was written when I was a prisoner
       (of my own device? oh to fly like a beagle or bagel
          anything but HEGEL; even KANT, he's better on marriage)
      and I though that maybe that was true
       but I hope the only way out isn't to have to be baseball
            or hawaiin (Cow (CB)....PUNCH, the OZmuns,(frankly mup)
            but this be glitch glitch glitch---

I can't let this pass without mentioning that we watched *Smokey and the
Bandit* in its entirety late the other night and it seemed utterly alien
material from another time.  To conceive of it being accepted by a
large-scale movie-going audience today is nearly impossible: it is almost
sublime in its simplicity, its constant repetition of a single motif:  The
Bandit drives really fast and gets away with it.  This is its one message,
its one object to be contemplated, its one source of pleasure.  Over and
over and over the bandit drives really, really fast (never mind why) and
avoids the smokeys.  One waits for something else but their *isn't*
something else.  And after 5, 6, 7 of these, to my amazament, this
becomes immensely pleasurable, the pleasure of the joke which is
gut-busting funny precisely because nothing could be less funny.  It
occurred to me that this must have come out just after Carter lowered the
speed-limit & so this must have tapped into the time-honored
"get-the-govt-off-our-backs" cultural mantra - but forget that, it ruins
the zen-like beauty of the thing.

On Pessoa, there is the brand new book, _An Introduction to Fernando
Pessoa_, by Darlene Sadlier_. (Univ Press of Florida), perhaps the
most extensive overview of FP and company in English. The
book's selected bibliography somehow omits _A Pessoa Centenary_
(Carcanet, pub. in '95 or thereabouts), which contains the only
English translation (to my knowledge) of Octavio Paz's truly
magisterial essay on the poet, plus loads of fantastic photos.

Uh, I hope no one minds a vaguely serious question about Pessoa, but I
remember several years ago a discussion of a bad translation of Pessoa
(hokey pokey & all).

Would anyone here care to to recommend some good ones?

I don't read translations much if I know the original language (I dislike
chilled soups) but I know Edwin Honig has done quite a bit of Pessoa. One
edition has an intro by Octavio Paz.  Since Honig is a quite interesting
poet his Pessoa would be worth looking at. A few poems translated by him
appear in _Poems for the Millenium_ vol. 1.

Herb:

In addition to poems available in translation from Honig there is
_The Book of Disquietude_, translated by Richard Zenith (Carcanet,
'96). This is the novel-length and still editorially contested
"journal" of Bernardo Soares, Pessoa's "semi-heteronym." Zenith's
(as well as Sadlier's) introductory essay here is worth a look to
give an idea of how byzantine and cut-throat is the world of Pessoa
scholarship.

this smokey and the bandit talk is too wierd. two weeks ago while camping
on an indian reserve in northern ontario they were playing the sound track
to smokey and the bandit on the community radio station.  my partner
couldn't believe that i knew all the words and could sing along. she'd
never heard of it. brought back good memories for some reason.

i wonder when you ask if it could hold a theatre full of adults today.i
wonder if it ever did or whether the theatre was just full of 11 year old
boys?

hmm

When Henry Adams talked about an accelerating historical pace he didn't
know the half of it. What a concept: "Smokey and the Bandit" as an artifact
of the Peaceable Kingdom.

Joe asked me to forward this -- he's temporarily off-list.

Folks:
I've been off-list for awhile and have no doubt missed some fascinating
discussions, but I have a favor to ask-Duncan McNaughton, whom many of
you
know or know of, will be giving a reading in Vancouver on or around
October
10, and would like to supplement that with other readings in either
Seattle,
Portland or Vancouver. I know the time frame is short, but if any of you
are
aware of possible venues for such readings in any of those three
cities-from, let's say, October 10 to the 17th-could you please contact
me
at jsafdie@mailnt.ctc.edu <mailto:jsafdie@mailnt.ctc.edu> ?
Duncan's un-electronic, so I'll have to be a go-between in this
enterprise.
Thanks in advance for any information you can forward along . . .
                                Best,

                                Joe Safdie

TEA-TIME WITH GLENDA

Glenda, the Goodhearted Arts Administrator ? and special guest Kristoff, Rebel
Academic? discuss alienation on the internet and its impact on individual arts
granting, travel funds for professional conferences, e-mail NEA petitions and
other arts-related issues.

GLENDA:  My guest today is Kristoff, the Moire Effect Chair and Professor of
Liminal Obfuscation at Brown Buffalo University. He is also the author, most
recently, of _In the Garden of Giordano Adorno: Totalitarianism and the New
Cyber Heretics_, published last year by Vervivovuva. Kristoff, I'm really happy
to have you here today. Everyone at the Foundation really loved your little
book.

KRISTOFF: Yes, it seems to have taken on a life of its own.

GLENDA:  "A life of its own." Wow. I've never thought of a book having "life"
before . . . but it does make an odd kind of sense. It's very
"phenomenological," isn't it? [Giggles.] The cover feels just like human skin!

KRISTOFF: "Giordano Adorno" is, as you know, a hippogriff.

GLENDA: [Blushing.] A hippo--?

KRISTOFF: --griff, yes. Though I suppose to be thoroughly post-Henna 90s about
it, we'd call her a hippogrrrl, hmm? "Hippogrrrl." Oh, my. Anyway, "Theodor
Bruno" just didn't seem quite as catchy. For [chuckles heartily], well, for
obvious reasons. But then one becomes endlessly attendant to this sort of
minutiae. Minutiae: M-i-n-u-t-i-a-e. It is all rather insect-like, isn't it?
So, hmm, yes, I suppose there really was something to Cronenberg's
cockroach-infested Burroughscape . . . [scribbles in noebook] . . .

GLENDA: You were just inspired to write a poem, weren't you! [Long, deep sigh.]
Okay. Let's go back to what you were saying before about books and life.
There's a relationship between the two you seem to be connecting up. That seems
so . . . radical . . . I  mean--

KRISTOFF: [Interrupting.] Oh, my, well [blows nose into monogrammed
handkerchief] it's very radical, Glenda, the academic climate being what it is.
[Under his breath:] Byzantine cutthroats!

GLENDA:  I just love the way books smell! [Inhales the binding of Kristoff's
book with near-perverse intensity.] How could anyone say the author is dead!
Smell him! Smell him, Kristoff! [Thrusts book in Kristoff's face, knocking his
glasses off.]

KRISTOFF: Uhn!

GLENDA: Oh my goodness! Kristoff! I'm so, so sorry! [Fumbles around on the
floor, coming up with Kristoff's glasses.] I do like these glasses. A lot of
our successful applicants this year are wearing them. [Looks out through
Kristoff's glasses.] I'm now seeing the world as Kristoff sees the world! Such
excess! And yet, such paucity! O! [Smiles, handing glasses back to Kristoff.
Sing-songy:] I know someone whose travel grant is going to come through!

KRISTOFF: Yes, well, where were we?

GLENDA: We were talking about your book. I just get so excited talking about
books. It gives me so much satisfaction to know that we have, through the
Foundation, helped bring so many important books into print. In fact, if I'm
not mistaken, _Giordano Adorno_ was one of them!

KRISTOFF: [With slight discomfort.] Indeed it was.

GLENDA: What's it about? Your book, I mean. It sounded interesting from your
proposal.

KRISTOFF: Let me see if I can break it down for you sans academese. I was
playing with ideas about identity, speed, the body, frames, the internet,
alienation, gender, sexual politics, and culture. I wanted to create a
post-panopticonic site in which to see the pathology of the individual played
out to its utter exhaustion against the totalitarian impulses of--

GLENDA: [Interrupting.] By "culture" you mean "multicultural"?

KRISTOFF: Well . . . yes, in a sense, I suppose--

GLENDA: [Visibly relieved; filling teeny-tiny boxes with expressive
checkmarks:] I thought so. Please, go on. This is truly fascinating. You're so
articulate! I'm so glad you're my guest today. [Squeezes Kristoff's arm.] Hey!
You have a tattoo! "I . . . heart . . . Kristeva . . ." Wow, Kristoff. You must
love your mother very, very much.

KRISTOFF: . . . er . . . yes . . . well,  so this book, really, is the
culmination of some twenty-five years of--

GLENDA: We have to cut to a commercial, Kristoff. Oh. No? We still have time?
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. Well, we have half a minute left. Listen. The Foundation
is putting together an evening of readings by younger poets, we want to feature
the best and the brightest . . . we put out an open call for applications, but
there's just . . . [sighs] . . . well, there's just a mountain of submissions,
Kristoff. We want to be fair about this, of course. So I'm wondering, since we
have you here . . .  as the Moire Effect Chair of Brown Buffalo, you better
than anyone in the country know who the most promising young poets of today are
. . . can you give us any suggestions? Lend us any arrows? Point us in the
right direction?

KRISTOFF: Glenda, I just happened to bring along a list of my former students,
among whom you'll find--

At the beginning of the summer I mentioned that I would read every book
published by the members of this list. Some of you have titles which are
very difficult to find, some were free, some places wanted full price no
matter what, some paid me to review them, others were found on
remainder, and some of you have decided to be published on presses who
are eager to receive money without sending product. Shame on you's. With
the exception of the latter, I have accomplished this feat. I also
finished all of the other books I intended to read. As for my intention
of interviewing everyone on this list, certain people paid no attention,
thirty one interviews were started and two were finished.

This fall, I am taking suggestions as to what I should do next.

My predictions-- Many books will be published. Many books will appear in
my mailbox (located at 345 E. Whittier St. Columbus OH 43206) there will
be a measurable ratio between the two if there was an enthusiasm towards
such. Many people will win awards, I know who some of you are already.
Jordan & Chris will find a smokey place without fire hence resolving
their feud. Henry's posts will slow with the student borrowing
onslaught. David and Kent will let people know they have never been
feuding. Dan Bouchard will visit another landmark or be given another
political situation to write about. Bill Luoma will ask another odd
question. The last issue of Mike & Dale & Hoa's younger poets will
happen shortly after they publish something else without asking the
author who happens to have years of explosives training funded by the US
government. Some louse will bring up someone like Armand Schwerner again
much to the chagrin of everyone. Many unintended postings will appear,
one which will cause particular scandal. Jeff Clark is determined not to
be an FBI agent and Jeff McDaniel will be. Someone will purposely make
mistakes in false self referentially. New people will lurk on the list
thinking their voice not important enough to type. In typical fashion
the fashionable will appear as such except to those who have experienced
the ruse of dandyism.

Recently, a book crawled into the post box of the ilk I rarely see.
Surely my only comfort in dead periods such as this on the list has been
Tony Hoagland's Donkey Gospel. You send me a funnier book than that &
I'll eat it.

Be well

sadly out-of-print. but Roger Conover was going to re-publish it. does anyone
know about this?

In The Lost Lunar Baedeker:Poems edited by Roger L. Conover (Farrar, Straus,
Giroux, l996), Conover did not include "Anglo-Mongrels and the Rose" but he
indicates in a note where it can be found as follows:  The Little Review 9:3
(Spring l923), pp. l0-l8; 9:4 (Autumn/Winter l923), pp. 41-51;
ContactCollectrion of Contemporary WRiters (Paris: Three Mountains Press,

Furher info on 'web depression' and the study discussed earlier came in
my mailbox today.  According to the APA Monitor the study in question is
schediled for publication in _The American Psychologist, certainly one
of the more rigorous journals in existence in terms of methodologies.
This should put to rest some of the doubts about validity, etc.,
expressed earlier.  The content is still open to conjecture?

The brief bits I posted were from the Honig _Poems of Fernando Pessoa_
(Ecco 1986).  City Lights has just reprinted that title, according to
Amazon.

Can anyone comment on the quality of the Richard Zenith translations in
_Fernando Pessoa & Co. : Selected Poems_ (Grove Press)?

re original query re pessoa's virginity...

in his wonderful introductory essay to the neat little photo-biography
"Fernando Pessoa" put out by Hazan's Pocket Archive (1997), Antonio Tabucchi
makes reference to a brief relationship b/t pessoa & one Ophelia Soares
Qeuiroz (not a heteronym!), a relationship "entirely played out on a level
which involved pain and suffering, morbidity, and possibly self-inflicted
injury."  beneath one of two photos of ophelia the text refers to the
relationship as "amorous"... there is also a copy of a plan drawn up by
pessoa to walk Ophelia home from work via a route that would maximize the
time spent together...

in jose saramago's novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis, more amorous
adventures are imagined (?) for pessoa.  in william boyd's story "Cork" (in
the collection The Destiny of Nathalie X ), there are explicit sex scenes
between a young woman and 3 different heteronymic versions of Pessoa, each
with a different ... technique.  Tabucchi has also invoked Pessoa in his
fiction, in the wonderous & melancholic Requim: A Hallucination, tho without
any carnal activities...

In addition to the famous heteronyms Caeiro, Campos, & Reis, there are also
Bernardo Soares (of the Book of Disquiet), Raphael Baldaya, Antonio Mora,
Charles Robert Anon, Alexander Search, A.A. Crosse, C. Pacheco, the Barao di
Tieve, Pantaleao, Vicente Guede, Abilio Quaresma, and others.  Most had
their own horoscopes, bibliographies, philosophies & aesthetics.  Critics of
each other in print & private.  A.A. Crosse won a famous puzzle contest &
loaned the winnings to Pessoa in order to buy a home for him & Ophelia...

Soares spoke I believe of writing as an expression of shared solitude.  On
his deathbed, his last words were "Hand me my glasses..."

a hundred years ago (well, on 9 sept 1898) St=E9phane Mallarm=E9 died.

odd to think that it took until the 1960s to see the publication of his "Le
Livre" =8B the great impossible score for what was absolutely not a "book" bu=
t
a performance score.

even odder, in a way, to think that it took until the 1970s to see the firs=
t
edition that complied with the poet's own specifications (page size, type
size, etc.) of his "Coup de D=E9."

a new biography & a new augmented & revised edition of his works (a Pl=E9iade
volume) have just come out.  This week's "Cahier Livres" in the daily
Lib=E9ration  has good articles on both & on the man:

p.s. what is Nedge?

Nedge is the current incarnation of one of the older little magazines around
(started as Harbinger in 1969; Northeast Journal, mid-70s [ie., NEJ];
Nedge, early 90s).  We are able to draw on a large submissions base and
try to emphasize the individual poem rather than the poet, the group,
or the trend.  We have published well-known & prizewinning poets, but
are equally proud to keep publishing new & "unknown" writers.  Despite
the Neanderthal tone of poetics list postings by that guy Henry Gould,
we have published poets like Leslie Scalapino & Rosmarie Waldrop & other
real avant-garde types!!  & we are very happy for the opportunity to
consider poems, prose, essays & reviews from list members.  [snail mail
only please, with SASE, to: Nedge, POB 2321, Providence, RI 02906]

Poem of the Day
OUR TOWN
Ryan J. Cunningham

Leaving our town you just can't do
All of us here will be missing you
Good luck where ever you may roam
Remember our town will always be home
Having you in our town has been fun
Sorry to see your time here is done.

Better to read in a park or at some friend's apartment than at Barnes &

Here's an idea for an oblique but handsome kind of federal support for the
arts.

The Starr report, now so generously supplied us via internet, is, I
believe, public domain. What's to keep some poetry press or presses from
publishing an illustrated edition? The proceeds should cover the production
costs of a lot of poetry books. My guess is that every member of the
federal and state legislatures would want one immediately, a hefty number
of sales even before the general public lines up.

As to illustrations, use your imaginations. My own idea would be, since
photos of the faces of celebrities are also public property (no libel law
protection there), to attach said images (and throw Starr in for good
measure) to body doubles behaving in an illustrative manner.

I throw this out for whoever wishes. I myself am too overcome with lethargy
to profit from my own idea. An acknowledgement on the copyright page would
be nice, tho.

Subject:      Best Sellers (?)
Content-Type: text/plain

Here's something almost as lurid as the story of the cigar in the Starr
Report.

A co-worker [the author of _God Save the Quarterback_, a sports book
about US style football in the UK, to be exact] pointed this out to me
and I pass it along more for bemusement than enlightenment, but...

Amazon.com now claims to have rank ordered all 3,000,000 books it claims
to sell in terms of their sales figures. In theory, at least, this
presents a poetry "best sellers" list.

There are obvious problems here. I for one tend to get my books from
three sources -- SPD, Bridge Street Books & directly from publishers --
none of which would ever get counted by such a system. And I suspect
that small press buyers in general will stay away from Amazon, so the
list is all the more suspect.

And it exists in a world in which Tom Clancy is still #1. Thus saying
nothing about value (or, perhaps, all too much). Of course, Mr. Clancy
is about to be displaced by Kenneth Starr when that hits your checkout
counter at the Super G next Tuesday (the first mass distributed porn
novel!).

But...

Here are some rankings as of yesterday (out of a possible 3 million).
Wherever there was a choice, I chose the paperback to check.

Best American Poetry, 1998                 3,761

Creeley, Life and Death                  198,541
Watten, Frame                            219,401
Hejinian, The Cold of Poetry             245,352
Elaine Equi, Decoy                       247,338
Bernstein, Dark City                     288,634
Bernstein, Close Listening               356,420
Watten, Total Syntax                     362,114

Perelman, Writing/Talks                  522,751
Armantrout, Made to Seem                 566,537
RS, Lyn, Watten, Davidson, Leningrad     665,959
Silliman, Demo to Ink                    771,155
Silliman, Xing                           771,157 (Meow Press!)
Fanny Howe, The End                      920,071
O'Sullivan, Out of Everywhere          1,061,724
Bromige, Harbormaster of Hong Kong     1,146,129
Jim Brodey, Heart of Breath            1,148,421

There are presumably two million books available through Amazon that
sell less well than does Jim Brodey's collected (which I own and
recommend, but would not buy through Amazon).

I will leave this to the sociologists of the imagination (Gary Sullivan,
are you out there?) to contemplate what any of this might mean.

Earlier this week, msnbc.com ran an article questioning amazon.com net
worth reports, and suggesting that they were both unreliable and
possibly manipulated.

I don't know how one goes about reading "back issues" of a website such
as msnbc, (obviously, I didn't try to retrieve this one) but articles
should be retrievable somehow.

Ron:

I don't think these figures mean much at all, except as a kind
of very short term index of orders. For example, someone wrote to me
about a month ago to tell me that lo and behold, when he had
looked a couple days back, _Doubled Flowering_ was ranked at 4,000
something out of 3 million titles. When I went to check, hardly
believing this could be true, the book ws listed at 29,000 or so. I
went back a few days later, and sure enough, there it was, pushing
10,000. Today, after reading your post, I checked again: Now it has
crashed down to 295,265!

Clearly, such wild fluctuations are caused by little conjunctural
sale-blips in a given week or two, most likely class orders for
poetry titles.

You don't really think these rankings suggest that there may yet be
hope for poetry in the market, do you?

Oops, as they say, I see in checking the post I mentioned that it was
not 4,000 some, but 14,000 some. Yasusada never did climb that high
in the Amazon rankings, I guess.

MAG NETS by M Magoolaghan, 20pp, PaperBrainPress1860 Pacific Beach Drive
#4, San Diego, CA 92109,

Tiles pulled randomly from packaging, loose letters and uncropped
combinations arranged as they were found provided the method of composition
used in this text.  The result is an extremely fractured sequence which,
beginning in near gibberish, gradually establishes its own idiom. An idiom
which mirrors beautifully the abundance of textual fracture with which we
are surrounded as each day offers its selection of  billboards, packaging,
headlines, notices and tickets. The author's decision to minimise editing
puts it up to the reader: are you going to look for significance? does it
hold together? is it fun? Yes to the last anyway, for the rest you're on
your own. There is a pleasant suggestion underlying this assembly of
relics, that "this too will pass' and in places a hint of the process of
language change as the jumps and truncations assert an odd but
self-consistent syntax.

The design of the book is charming, size 106 mm x 221 mm just right for the
drawing of the double doored  fridge which takes up the cover (the theme
continues on the back cover with a drawing of all those loops for pumping
out the heat) . The title and author's name are tricked out as fridge
magnets. I didn't mention that after pages of short lines as in the example
above there's a block of text about a third of a page long that in that
context has the effect of a choir bursting out from behind a bush at a
picnic. Long live PBP.

Subject:      Numbers
Content-Type: text/plain

Obviously, I don't think the numbers here can be trusted -- even if they
are not tampered with in any way, the source itself makes it a far cry
from any kind of neutral perspective. Amazon.com is attractive to a
particular kind of web buyer, generally, plus some other types under
particular circumstances.

But I did look at those numbers both hopefully and in despair.
Hopefully, because well, darn, there are 2 million books that come AFTER
the very last of my examples. In despair, thinking of what numbers like
those mean for the distribution of poetry in general bookstores period.
Think of the medium sized independent book store with room for 50,000
titles max. How many books of poetry will they carry and of what sort?

On the third hand, however, I was intrigued that the inherent "top of
mind" bias I would expect regarding the NY trade houses did not show up
more pronouncedly. Certainly, those presses will be more widely
represented in my hypothetical 50K title independent, where distribution
comes much more into play, and even moreso in the chains. Yet, move them
just one step away from that sort of distribution bias, like a virtual
service would, and the playing field levels significantly. They may
still get all the reviews in the NYT and NYBR, but it's a pleasure to
see Ginsberg, Poems for the Millenium and Sun & Moon books represented
as highly as they are.

And it's great to see Lew Welch (one of my tests for The Disappeared)
show up so highly. Unfortunately, Amazon claimed not to have heard of
Joe Ceravolo when I searched.

But as Pound, Creeley, Spicer, Judy Grahn, Lee Hickman and others have
all already proven, you can change the world of poetry with just a few
copies of anything if you just get them into the hands of their best
possible audience.

Ron

I guess the difference would lie in the single-mindedness of the bandit
scenario - no weaving of various plots (part of the fun of Seinfeld, where
various jokes end up surprisingly in dialogue) - and also none of
Seinfeld's ironic winking, his pop-post-mod admission that its all
artifice.  Smokey and the Bandit is straight up and it assumes that
speeding without getting pulled over is transcendental good fun.   -m.

On Fri, 11 Sep 1998 "T. Bartleby Jones" (dbuuck@SIRIUS.COM) wrote about the
ways in which later 20th century heterosexuals have taken Fernando Pessoa
as one of their own, giving him an enviable sexual afterlife . . .  We
might also take a look at Donald Mager's entry on Pessoa in the "Gay and
Lesbian Literary Heritage" (Henry Holt, 1995) in which FP is refigured into
a kind of Portuguese Langston Hughes, refined, dandyish, left-leaning,
virginal, but obsessed, in his English poems, with A E Housman, Hadrian,
Antinous, and (as "Alvaro de Campos") with the shamanic gay
interpenetrative spirit of Walt Whitman.

His heteronyms, etc., in this essay seen as a species of drag performativity.

But I know next to nothing about Pessoa and perhaps there really was an
"Ophelia."

To all concerned as contributors or potential readers, _the visual poetry
book_ edited by Upton and Cobbing and including many from USA and Canada,
now entitled  WORD SCORE UTTERANCE CHOREOGRAPHY and now with the ISBN  0
86162 750 4 goes to the printers this week, at what looks like 156 pages,
after a couple of last minute adjustments - and it is hoped that it will be
out quite quickly.

I know when it is hoped to launch but will keep shtumm until I know if it's
possible. Quite soon though. More news when available.

I suspended my mail for about a month while I was away and haven't caught up
yet so please forgive me if this has been listed already - for those
interested not just in the work of Bob Cobbing but in visual and sound
poetry generally may I recommend
BALLET OF THE SPEECH ORGANS: BOB COBBING ON BOB COBBING
an interview by Steven Ross Smith published after 17 years...

A very intleligent I mean intelligent interview and therefore worth getting
though I strongly suspect Bob would not stand by everything in it now.
Underwhich Editions, Toronto ISBN 0 88658 096 X

All best

On the other hand, you could decide there is no "world of poetry".
That audience-measuring and political/status considerations are
irrelevant.  You could look out onto Desolation Row.  - Henry Gould

According to the Paris Press website (www.westmass.com/Paris-Press), which I
believe was last updated in the beginning of 1998, they have "plans" to
publish Rukeyser's _Collected Poems_ "soon." Hope this helps.

 Dear Letters Editor:

 I found your fall preview of movies, books, music, and art [ART FOR
 AUTUMN, Sept. 7, 1998] informative, eclectic, and enjoyable. It
 was a pleasant surprise to see the likes of P.J. Harvey and Joshua
 Redman mentioned alongside of more commercially popular artists such
 as Alanis Morisette and Stephen King. I cannot help but notice, however,
 that in an article devoted to promoting (or at least exposing consumers
 to) a wide range of new art/entertainment product, the conspicious lack
 of any books of poetry on this list. This lack is made even more
 conspicious, for me, by the fact that you actually quote both John
 Keats and Robert Frost in your introduction to the list--neither of
 whom, presumably, have any new "product" for sale. I am aware that
 conventional market wisdom says poetry--especially contemporary poetry--
 does not sell, but with the recent erosion of NEA funding for poets
 and trends in publishing that make it more difficult for poets who are
 not already "stars" in other fields (Jewel, Jimmy Carter) to find
 major distribution for their books, I cannot help but wonder if one
 of the main reasons contemporary poetry doesn't sell--or is even read
 as much as Frost or Keats--is because forums like Newsweek do not
 consider it worthy of attention in the company of Tom Wolfe, Jackson
 Pollock, and Harold Bloom. To answer your question: "Should we quote
 more poetry?" Yes, but it would be even better if you REVIEWED it
 as well.

Welcome to Bill Griffiths' NOMAD SENSE (Talus Editions, c/o English
Department, King's College, Strand, London WC2R 2LS; four pound fifty or
eight dollars). These are poems of un-rootedness, and of the rejection of
security - they carry on, in some ways, from the poems of "vegetable
passion" in _Rousseau & the Wicked_ (Invisible Books 1996), reflecting,
perhaps, Bill's shifts between the Durham coast at Seaham and his work in
the Eric Mottram Archive in the wicked city. They live under an image:
"The future belongs to those who are mobile" which Bill sources as
"communications advert in Time 22 Nov 1993 opposite a chart showing the
rise from 2 million to 18 million refugees around the world 1976-1992,
according to United Nations figures": the contrasts and oppositions run
through the book:  here's a different take on "talk with the animals" from
"More Binaries":

lions by that express pain

or

- and here's the closing bit of "Seed-Time" - a distinctly
non-wordsworthian view of seed packets...:

ANNOUNCING an update to the TEXTBASE webpage featuring experimental writing
& visual
art projects from MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.

<http://www.skynet.apana.org.au/~samiam/textbase/textbase.htm>

TEXTBASE has been operating for a few years as a loose collective of
writers working in the visual arts scene & we are now publishing our own
literary journal.  the TEXTBASE webpage features a complete
documentation of our visual arts projects as well as the first two issues
of the journal. there are also some interesting hypertext pieces on the
webpage - i recommend benjamin brady's "a is for geophysics" for those of
you with good graphics & sound.   any comments/criticism/inquiries
appreciated.

BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE: i still have six hard copies of the first two
issues of the journal which i'm willing to send to interested parties. this
is a free offer but swaps for your journal/chapbook/whatever would be
great.  backchannel a name & address.

Sorry, I just realised I didn't indicate which parts are new - it's
probably not obvious.  The new parts are three new projects under the
Projects section - the Stickers project & City Lights. The third is
Concrete Poetry, a new exhibition at 1st Floor (under Projects, 1st Floor).

Literary Translation: Priorities, Theory, Practice -- a conference to be
held November 13, 14, and 15 at the Stevens Institute of Technology.
Speakers include Allen Mandelbaum, Serge Gavronsky, Armand Schwerner,
Katherine Washburn, David Curzon, John High, and many others. The
conference will include some of the most distinguished poets
and translators of poetry working today.

Poets are invited to read their translations of other poets' works or
translations of their own works. Please contact either Deborah
Sinnreich-Levi at dsinnrei@stevens-tech.edu and/or Ed Foster, Humanities
Dept., Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ 07030.

We are also interested in papers on any aspect of literary translations.
Sessions will be held through-out the conference on a great variety of
subjects. There will also be workshops in Russian, French, Chinese
(classical and modern), Japanese, Turkish, Hebrew, Urdu, Afrikaans, and
many others.

The conference fee is $35 ($10 for graduate students) but can be waived
in cases of hardship.

American poets are criticized for being isolated, for talking only to
each other, and for writing in a world that has little to do with what is
happening elsewhere. We will have poets and scholars attending from a
great many parts of the poetry universe. Come and read your works and help
us prove that the criticism is wrong. And find out, too, what is happening
in China . . . in Germany . . . in Russia . . . . . .

  That the "Speaker" of the song is speaking from within desolation
  row rather than from outside of it....
  i think if you listen to--or look at--the lyrics
  that's consistent throughout--
  he may have to "lean [his] head out far enough" from it
  in order to be able to write the song, but
  that doesn't mean he's not speaking "from" it.......

I looked up Gerald Burns's _Letters to Obscure Men_, a book from 1975 not only
long out of print, but many copies of which were burned in a huge house fire
(back, I think, when publisher Jim Haining lived in Illinois). Sales of this
nearly impossible-to-find-item (of which I have a copy, btw, & will photocopy
for anyone who wants to read it, gratis; just e-along your address) are flying
out of Amazon's virtual warehouse swifter than 2,025,559 of their other titles
(it's listed today as 974,441th most popular).

Oh, I'm sure Amazon's numbers have real-world correlation of some form or
another. I'm just not convinced it's "sales." Maybe it's to "potential
chimps-having-the-special-desire-to-flip-page-given-any-one-page-to-start"? It
seems like maybe if you handed Gerald's book to 3 million chimps, approximately
974,441 might bother to flip a page, even back & forth several times.

Sociologist of the Imagination? Well, what does it pay? Ron, can I put you down
as a reference?

What else? Oh, yeah, before I forget: Billy "double diminutive living on song
street in nowhere" Little, five bucks says you're a pseudonym. (Forgive me if
you're not. I actually thought Bill Luoma's _My Trip_ was Ron Padgett, doing
another "Leon"-like project, & even wrote to Geoffrey Young saying, "Thanks,
this _is_ Padgett, right?" He assured me it wasn't. I didn't believe him. I do
now, I guess.)

Oh, and: My book, _Dead Man_ (also Meow Press!), while listed, didn't even have
a number _assigned_ to it. That means like all 3 million more-customer-friendly
Amazon books beat the holy living crap out of my teeny tiny nothing little
shit-ass chapbook flop every sad motherfucking day of the year.

Waaaah!

I don't get it.  What are you correcting?  I listened to it last night -
they were playing a great live rendition from a concert he gave in
Manchester in 1966.  Obviously the "speaker" is singing from/in/on/under
Desolation Row.  But what does this have to do with the statement
Ron made and the dismal counter-statement I made?  Other than trying
to suggest I haven't heard the lines correctly (which I had) & therefore
could be dismissed?  I'm not being cantankerous, Chris - just tangled up.

A question to any of you poetics folks who are publishing books. Chax books
are either bound here by myself with helpers, or, if they are trade
paperback books with perfect or smyth sewn bindings, the binding is taken
care of along with the printing.

But I'm looking for any recommendations of binders who will take
already-printed pages and turn them into perfect-bound books which look
decent, for a reasonable price.

If anyone has experience with this, and a binder to recomend, please e-mail
me directly at
chax@theriver.com


thank you so much,

To All Of You School Teachers Out There:

This semester I'm teaching an intro to lit course that includes a
theory/criticism component. The previously-assigned text for this course
has a chapter on Structuralism & Poststructuralism, the subheadings of
which include "Russian Formalism," "Semiotics or Semiology," "French
Structuralism" and "Poststructuralism." All in fifteen easy pages.
Needless to say, this chapter is "introductory" to the point of being
useless, so I'd appreciate hearing from anyone (by backchannel) who can
recommend a better survey of the terrain--perhaps an essay or chapter,
rather than an entire monograph. Preferably something that would be
comprehensible to a freshman college student.

Thanks in advance.

A fellow school teacher,

Mark Salerno

Amazon also has best sellers by sub-category.  In poetry, single authors,
American, the list is dominated by Shel Silverstein and Kahil Gibran, with
someone named "Jewel" in the number 1 spot. 9, 10, and 11 are Steven,
Ginsberg, and Chas. Wright, with Donald Hall at # 12.

Who is Billy Collins? He has a couple of books in the top ten?

In Spanish poetry (in translation of course) Pablo Neruda is the author
of 24 of the top fifty, including 8 of the top 10.

Folks:

        There was a late summer pause in our e-mailings, so this one will
be a bit longer than usual -- in fact I have divided it into two sections
to make it easier for the server to send. From now on we are aiming at
once-a-week e-mailings.  If you have something you would like to put up on
the list, send it to this list's e-mail address.  Right now, we have to be
selective in what we post, mainly because of limited resources.  In the
near future we hope to set this list up on listserv software, with a
moderator, which will make everything much easier and more efficient for
all of us.
        Summer is waning and fall is approaching.  We want to urge
everyone on this list, especially those on college campuses, to do what
they can to initiate or support anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic
working-class-oriented activity -- either as a part of SAWSJ or in other
ways.  Hopefully, this e-mailing will help in that effort.  Please keep in
touch.
        Finally, we welcome to all new subscribers.

                                        Andor Skotnes

        Last month, an e-mailing on this list included a invitation to
support the Tom Leedham Legal and Accounting Fund and the TDU's Teamster
Rank and File Education and Legal Defense Foundation.  The Hoffa Unity
Slate believes that, by sending this message, we violated the rules
governing the Teamster election and has cited us to that effect.
Evidently this Hoffa Unity protest is just one of a great many that it
have been filed.  The SAWSJ Coordinating Committee is currently working on
a response to this protest.  For your information, the text of the protest
letter appears below.  As you will see, the protest against SAWSJ is made
on the rather surprising grounds that SAWSJ is an employer.

Re: Enclosed Protest

Dear Mr. Cherkaksy:

        James P. Hoffa and the Hoffa Unity Slate file this protest against
Tom Leedham, the Tom Leedham Slate, "Scholars, Artists and Writers for
Social Justice (SAWSJ)," TDU and the Teamster Rank and File Education and
Legal Defense Foundation on the ground that the enclosed newsgroup posting
by SAWSJ (Exhibit A) constitutues an improper solicitation for funds for
the Leedham Legal and Accounting Fund and for the Teamster Rank and File
Education and Legal Defense Fund.

        Exhibit A is a printed copy of an electronic posting made by SAWSJ
to an electronic newsgroup with the address of <misc.activism.progressive>
The posting lists "sawsj @Sage.EDU" as the individual making the posting
(in the second line following "From:").  This is the address of SAWSJ.
Item 4 of the posting is a solicitation for contributions to the Leedham
Legal and Accounting Fund and to the TDU's so-called "Teamster Rank and
File Education and Legal Defense Foundation."  By posting this item to the
newsgroup, SAWSJ was soliciting, or at least facilitating and assisting
the solicitation of , funds for the Leedham Legal and Accounting fund and
the Teamster Rank and File Legal Defense Foundation.  The solicitation
states that the purpose of  soliciting funds for the Teamster Rank and
File Education and Legal Defense Foundation is to obtain funds to support
the Leedham Legal and Accounting Fund.  See Exhibit A-3: "[NOTE; The TDU's
Teamster Rank and File Education and Legal Defense Fund is also accepting
donations for similar purposes.]."

        Exhibits B and C show that SAWSJ is an employer.  Exhibit B is a
printed copy of  the SAWSJ home page which appears at
<http:\www.sage.edu\sawsj\>[sic].  Exhibit C is a printed copy of the
site's "SAWSJ Organization & Leadership" sub-page. The statements on the
sub-page establish that SAWSJ is an arm of the Labor Relations and
Research Center at the University of Massachusetts (an employer), that
SAWSJ is funded by several Universities (employers) who subsidize the
activities [sic] the individuals who constitute the SAWSJ's "Coordinating
Committee" and members, and that the SAWSJ employs a "staffperson" and
therefore is itself and employer.

        The solicitation by SAWSJ is therefore a solicitation by an
employer and is contrary to the Rules which provide that funds for a
candidate's Legal and Accounting Fund can be solicited only by the
candidate, members and a member's immediate family and that all expenses
associated with any such solicitation must be paid for with unrestricted
campaign funds.

        The Election Officer should order the Leedham campaign to cease
and desist from these improper solicitations, should require SAWSJ to post
an appropriate notice, and should require the Leedham Legal and Accounting
Fund and the Teamster Rank and File Education and Legal Defense Foundation
to return all contributions that result from this improper solicitation.

                                        Very truly yours
                                        [signed]
                                        Patrick J. Szymanski

2. BEVERLY ENTERPRISES CONTINUES ITS SUIT AGAINST SEIU LOCAL 585 AND
ROSEMARY TRUMP

        Under pressure, Beverly Enterprises dropped its absurd defamation
suit against Kate Bronfenbrenner, professor of Labor Relations at Cornell
University and SAWSJ activist.  This suit was Beverly's response to
Bronfenbrenner's from testimony at a Congressional hearing about Beverly's
anti-labor practices.  However, as Kate wrote last month, Beverly has
continued its suit against SEIU's Rosemary Trump and SEIU local 585 for
the same alleged offense.  WE NEED TO HELP TO PUT PRESSURE ON BEVERLY TO
END THIS FOOLISHNESS.  You are urged to write or e-mail Speaker of the
House, Newt Gingrich (georgia6@hr.house.gov), urging that the general
counsel of the House file an amicus brief in the 3d Circuit Court of
Appeals in this case. The amicus brief will focus on the issue of
testimonial immunity for expert witnesses who are asked to testify at
Congressional forums and hearings. If you want more background information
about the Beverly suit, please consult the SAWSJ web site at
www.sage.edu/html/SAWSJ.

3. SAWSJ BAY AREA ORGANIZING MEETING, 9/15

ANNOUNCEMENT:

Dear friend,

We are writing you today, because we understand that you are one of the
Bay
Area individuals interested in working with the group called Scholars,
Artists & Writers for Social Justice (SAWSJ).

WE ARE CONVENING A MEETING TO FORM A BAY AREA CHAPTER OF SAWSJ ON TUESDAY,
SEPTEMBER 15th, 7:00 pm, AT THE HOME OF JACK KURZWEIL, 1737 Allston Way,
Berkeley, CA 94703

As you may already know, SAWSJ was recently formed through the work of
people involved in a series of Campus-Labor Teach-Ins held across the
country in 1996 and 1997. The SAWSJ founding statement, originally
published in the Nation during 1997 (and available at the SAWSJ web site:
www.sage.edu/html/SAWSJ), describes the organization's mission:

1. To restore the mutually empowering relationship that once existed
between the labor movement and the academic and cultural communities

2. To foster the growth of a vibrant, militant, multicultural
working-class
movement

3. To assist the organizing drives of the new labor movement

In April of this year SAWSJ held its founding convention in Washington,
D.C., at which it adopted  a constitution, elected a national leadership,
and issued a call for members to form local chapters and start organizing.

We agree with the mission of SAWSJ and have decided to form a local SAWSJ
chapter in the Bay Area. We are therefore inviting you to this first
organizing meeting.

Your participation in this important project is crucial!

Please RSVP to Ken via email (kkloc@igc.org) or phone (510-594-8649).

In Solidarity,

Ken Kloc, Jack Kurzweil, Ellen Starbird, & Ted Stolze

4.  SUPPORT SYACUSE UNIVERSITY STRIKERS

To SAWSJ:

I would like to appeal to your organization for help in putting national
pressure on Syracuse University for the punitive position it has taken
against faculty and students supporting striking workers on our campus.

The strike of 750 SEIU Local 200A members, who work in our libraries, as
food service workers, in physical plant, and as custodians, is over
subcontracting issues as well as wages and benefits.  Syracuse University
has already replaced 100 union workers over the last 8 years with
temporary workers receiving near minimum wage with no benefits.  The union
wants protection in the contract against further degradation of the
workforce.  The university has refused, and has now hired Pinkertons,
threatened faculty and staff who strike in sympathy with being fired, and
told students they cannot leaflet as individuals on the campus in favor of
the union!

I have received your emails over the years, and Kate Bronfenbrenner, whose
case involving Beverly Enterprises was aided by your efforts, has
suggested that this list would be a good venue for a national petition
campaign against our university union-busting efforts. Apparently,
Syracuse University and Beverly Enterprises are cut from the same
corporate cloth which is working to stifle academic discussion over
corporate privilege, no matter what the social cost.

Here are some other efforts the university has taken against supporters of
the strike:

1. Non-union staff have been told they will lose their jobs if they refuse
to cross the picket line; their wages withheld and medical benefits will
be denied immediately, and if their family members are using tuition
benefits to take classes at SU they will be yanked out of classes.

2. Faculty members have been told we will also have wages and benefits
withheld, and may be replaced as well. We have been receiving daily
messages of intimidation from the administration.  Faculty who have
organized a teach-in on the campus about the strike for the students have
been told "that won't be allowed."

3. Chairs of departments have been told they will no longer be chairs if
they are not in their offices on the day the strike begins (which will be
tomorrow, Aug. 31).  They are also told they must deliver to the deans the
names of all staff and faculty who are not at work so that their wages and
benefits can be withheld and they can be replaced.

4. Students have been told, unbelievably, the following, which is quoted
directly from the administration:

    "Students who are supportive of the Union issue are NOT allowed AS
INDIVIDUALS to disseminate information on University property -- as they
are acting in stead for Union members.

        "Students wishing to support Union issues may act through
RECOGNIZED STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS if their organization, AS A WHOLE,
supports the Union issues.  In this case, the organization must follow
standard university protocol in REQUESTING AND RESERVING space and/or
equipment (such as tables and chairs) through Event Scheduling.

        "Graduates who hold scholarships, fellowships, graduate
assistantships, research assistantships and teaching assistantships do so
as UNIVERSITY beneficiaries."

The campus has now become like an armed camp, with extra security guards
and police roaming in groups, posted at every entrance and every parking
gate.  The city bus system has been rerouted to deliver busloads of scabs.

Meanwhile, the university administration continues to publicly proclaim
this to be the leading "student centered research university" in the
country.  We say: it is the leading "student CENSORED research university
in the country!

You can view more information about the strike on our web page (which is
still under construction) at:

http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/maxpages/faculty/merupert/SUlabor.htm


Please help us.  Please contact me as soon as possible about a petition
drive using your list.  We would like the petition to read something like
the following:

We call on Chancellor Kenneth Shaw of Syracuse University to
cease and desist all punitive and intimidating measures against Syracuse
University faculty and staff who support the union employees strike and
wish to disseminate information to the campus of the union's position.  We
also call on him to stop trying to run the university on the backs of its
lowest paid, least powerful employees, and of trying to pit their needs
against the students' needs.


Thank you so much for your help.

5. SUPPORT JAZZ FACULTY ORGANIZING AT THE NEW SCHOOL

Dear Labor Supporter, and Music Lover

I am writing to you on behalf of the 70 part time Jazz faculty at the New
School, who have been trying for eight long months to negotiate a first
contract with management. During our struggle to win the right to vote on
union representation in December, 1997, many of you played a pivotal role
in convincing the New School to live up to their progressive ideals and
allow musicians to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted a
union. As a result of hundreds of letters, emails, faxes, and phone calls,
the New School allowed a vote, which overwhelmingly showed that the jazz
faculty wanted a union.

Since that time, Local 802 has been negotiating with management for a
first contract. From the beginning, our elected bargaining committee has
made it clear to management that four items must be included in any
contract: a fair wage, pension contributions, job security, and health
benefits.  Although our current positions on wages and health benefits are
not that far apart, to date the New School has refused even to give us a
counterproposal on pension contributions, and our demands for job security
have fallen on deaf ears.

We believe that the New School -- once again -- needs a moral push.  We
are asking our allies in the labor, religious, neighborhood and political
communities to lend your moral support to our struggle for a just contract
with the New School.

Please take the time email New School President Fanton to urge him to do
what is right, and settle with the Jazz faculty who have made the Jazz
program the best in the world.  Dr. Fanton's email address is:
fanton@newschool.edu

We are asking for what is reasonable, and what the other unionized workers
at the university already enjoy: a decent pension, and job security.

Please forward all correspondence with Dr. Fanton to Local 802's
Organizing Department.  Email copies of your emails to us at:

Tdubnau@local802afm.org.
If you have any questions, please call Local 802 Organizer Tim Dubnau at
(212) 245-4802, Ext. 185.

Thank you very much for your help.

                                        In Solidarity,

                                        William Moriarity
                                        PRESIDENT, Local 802 AFM

6. CONFERENCE: 3RD NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WHITENESS

CALL FOR PRESENTERS

November 6-8, 1998
University of Chicago

Beyond "White," "Black" or "Other": Confronting Whiteness to End Racism

W E ' R E   I N V I T I N G . . .
Organizations and individuals who are... Activists,  Educators,  Scholars,
Organizers, Community members and leaders, Spiritual members and leaders,
Artists, Trainers, Consultants, and all generally interested in
supporting the theme, the mission, and goals of the conference.

T O   P R E S E N T . . .
Workshops, panel discussions, papers, symposiums, artistic performances,
roundtable discussions, and other events of potential interest to
participants.

F O C U S I N G   O N . . .

OUR THEME: (Beyond "White," "Black," or "Other") We use the term "Other"
to denote the centrality and focus on racism in the U.S.A. as a
"black/white"  issue. The title also reflects the common usage of these
terms. Our goal here is to challenge all these divisions -- to get
"Beyond" them -- not to endorse them. We understand Native Americans,
Latinos, Asian Americans, to name a few groups, are often left out of the
analysis and discussion. Our hope is to create space where dialogue occurs
and awareness increases on these issues. We're specifically interested in
examining how whiteness has created, contributed to and maintained the
racial categorization of "white,"  "black" or "other" and what new ideas,
strategies, tactics and definitions can be used to move beyond this idea
which has been so politically, spiritually, morally, economically and
socially divisive.

OUR MISSION: To hear diverse voices and ideas on how to confront whiteness
to end racism.

OUR GOALS:
* Expand the analysis of racism and "white" supremacy beyond "black" and
"white"
* Build alliances among anti-racists to confront the legacy of "white"
supremacy
* Explore how ideas of "whiteness" relate to "race," class, gender,
  sexuality, age, ethnicity and other diverse ideas of human differences
* Spark antiracist action locally and nationally
* Explore strategies and tactics to make the discussion of "whiteness" and
  antiracism a mainstream issue
* Bridge the experiences of academics and activists
* Develop more accessible and effective language to discuss concepts of
"race" and racism
* Encourage "white" people to examine their role in the perpetuation of
Racism both personally and as members of the "white" race
* Make sure people of all "racial"  and cultural groups are involved in
leadership roles in the study of "whiteness"
*Explore how "whiteness" has denied the "multiracial" heritage and history
of the U.S.A. and its people
* Explore the history of the idea of "whiteness" and its relationship to
racial oppression, the idea of "non-white" inferiority and the idea of
"white" supremacy

H O W   T O   S U B M I T   A   P R O P O S A L

*Send us a 1-page description of your presentation, workshop, event etc.

*Include your name and contact information.

*Indicate the length of your event. We are blocking program time for
events either 1 hour in length (60 minutes) or 2 and 1/2 hours in length
(150 minutes). If you are proposing an event of some other length, please
specify this. Depending on the proposal we may or may not be able to find
a space on the program.

*Indicate space or equipment requirements if you need more than a simple
classroom and blackboard setting. Simple is better, but we will try to
accommodate special needs.

*When possible, (to help us)  please submit proposals by email. This helps
us keep our cost low and to circulate submissions for review. Email
submissions should be sent to contact@euroamerican.org

If you do not have email, we will accept proposals by U.S. mail at Center
for Study, 245 West 4th Avenue, Roselle, NJ 07203

We will begin selecting proposals October 1, 1998. Submissions will be
reviewed until all remaining positions on the schedule are full.

For information on the submission process, please contact Jeff Hitchcock,
Executive Director, Center for the Study of White American Culture by
phone at (908) 241-5439 or by email at jeffhitchcock@euroamerican.org

T O P R E S E N T E R S . . .  The National Conference on Whiteness, an
annual event, drew over 300 people in Cambridge, Mass. last November. From
our start, we have envisioned the conference as a 20-year series that not
only looks at whiteness, but also mobilizes the attention and resources
needed to act on it on a national scale. This year, our third, we're
planning for 500 participants. As with last year's event, funding is
limited. The conference is administered by a collection of small nonprofit
organizations, i.e. we have no large institutional sponsor. Over 95% of
our funds came from registration fees.

We can not reimburse expenses to presenters. But if you do present, we
recommend you take advantage of our sliding registration fee scale (from
$150 down to $15) commensurate with your contribution, and balanced
against the difficulty or success you have in obtaining other funding.

We look forward to continuing our relationship with those who have worked
with us previously, and we encourage those just hearing about us to join
the process. For more information on the conference, check the conference
web site being hosted at www.euroamerican.org.

7. CONFERENCE : THE LAST FRONT: CORPORATIZATION & THE END OF PUBLIC
EDUCATION

Dear Friends:

On October 10-11, 1998, public education activists will convene at
San Francisco State University to learn more about, and organize
against, the privatization of public education. "The Last Front:
Corporatization & The End of Public Education" will be hosted in
part by the Anti-CETI Coalition, which recently defeated an attempt
to privatize the California State University technology system.

As private investment takes on larger roles in public education, very
real threats to democratic self-determination and civil rights are
posed to both students and teachers.  From Channel One to Edison
Charter Schools to AT&T Phone/I.D. cards, privatization threatens
teacher unions, student/faculty intellectual property rights, and
public accessibility to education. The influx of corporate moneys
within the seemingly autonomous face of public education calls for a
reassessment of both what it means to be a corporation, and what it
means to provide a public education.

We hope you will join us in San Francisco on the weekend of
October 10-11. We need your participation so that we can make
these necessary reassessments -- and so that we can organize a more
effective movement in defense of public education.

We also need your financial support. By sending a donation today,
you will assist in the funding of publicity and outreach, a
Conference Truth-Kit, and, most important, subsidized traveling
expenses for speakers and student participants.

Donations can be sent to:
The Last Front
2700 - 23rd. St.
San Francisco, CA 94110

(Please make checks payable to The Last Front).

In fighting against the privatization of education, we are fighting for
public education, an essential element of a living democracy. We are
counting on your support for this event. Together we will defend
public education from corporate takeover.

Thank you in advance for your support,
John Murphy,
on behalf of the
Last Front Organizing Committee

8. AFTRA, SAG, AND UCLA LABOR EDUCATION SEEK RESEARCHERS

From: Paul Worthman <PWorthma@AFTRA.com>

The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA) and the
Screen Actors Guild (SAG) are engaged in a joint research project with the
collaboration of the UCLA Center for Labor Education and Research. We are
currently seeking student researchers in about six cities who can do data
entry for a period of about 2-3 weeks, and then participate in
interviewing performers, producers, agents, and corporate and non-profit
clients who contract for audio or video work for training, education or
instruction, sales, phonecasting and other such work.

We are currently seeking researchers, and hopefully a faculty sponsor for
the student(s), in the following cities:

Denver, San Francisco, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

I have attached a brief summary of the project we are engaged in. I would
appreciate your circulating this message to SAWSJ members.  If you know of
a student who might be interested in this position, or can refer the
inquiry to appropriate faculty or career centers in the targeted cities we
would be appreciative.

I would be happy to discuss the project more with interested SAWSJ members
who might be able to assist us and who wants to contact me.

ATTACHMENT:

The UCLA Center for Labor Education and Research and the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), and the Screen Actors
Guild (SAG)  are jointly undertaking a national research project. We are
exploring recorded audio and visual work done in about 20 cities across
the country which we loosely characterizze as "industrial, non-broadcast"
(excluding radio and television commercials). In essence, this work
consists of such things as sales videos, convention or trade show
material, training, educational or instructional material, in-flight or
cruise line entertainment, or similar activities. This area of work
constitutes a small, but not insignificant part of actual and potential
earnings for performers.

Indeed, we have some evidence that total earnings throughout the country
easily exceed $100 million. Some of it is done by or commissioned by large
private sector, governmental or non-profit agencies, while other work is
done by small firms or individuals. While a good deal of it is currently
done under agreements with AFTRA or SAG, most of the work is not done this
way.

Our immediate research objective is to learn as much as we can about the
totality of the work and answer such questions as:
exactly what work is being done, and where is being done?
who is commissioning the work?
who is producing the work?
who is casting the work?
who is doing the work?
what kinds of budgets are established for different kinds of projects?

We are seeking an "academic sponsor" in each of about 20 cities who would
endorse an undergraduate or graduate student who would undertake such an
investigation for us and with us. We would be asking the students to spend
some time in the AFTRA and SAG offices extracting data we already have on
record and putting it into a data base. Then, we would want the student(s)
to conduct interviews (which we have developed) with clients, producers,
directors, agents, and talent to broaden our information base and gain
more information about those areas and projects for which we do not have
data.

We can pay students around $9.15 per hour for this work (and perhaps it is
negotiable).

While I have been in contact with some academics in several cities, I
appreciate your willingness to forward this to people you know. Please
have them direct questions, comments or their willingness to help to me -
or Mathis Dunn, AFTRA's Assistant National Director- at 213-634-8113; or
email me at pworthma@aftra.com .

9. HOTEL WORKERS UNION SEEKS RESEARCHERS FOR EXCITING CAMPAIGNS THROUGHOUT
NORTH AMERICA

The Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union (HERE) is
recruiting full-time research staff for its fast-growing Research
Department.  Positions are currently available in a number of regions
across the U.S.  and Canada, with new positions opening frequently (see
listing below).

The department is responsible for conducting in-depth research and for
assisting in the development and implementation of strategic campaigns in
support of organizing and bargaining struggles in the hotel, food service

Mark,

Although it doesn't explicitly address Structuralism, Steven Lynn's
_Texts & Contexts: Writing About Literature with Critical Theory_ [now
in a second edition] offers a very readable introduction to New
Criticism, Reader-Response, Deconstruction, Biographical/Historical,
Psychological, and Feminist approaches. I've used in in half a dozen lit
courses with considerable success. It even presents sample short essays
in each chapter -- including rough drafts and revisions! -- showing how
to apply the approach to a text. HarperCollins published it in 1994.
ISBN 0-06-500099-4 [but get the new edition].

Best,

Healthy but depressed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. government agency said Friday it had set
up an Internet site that will control people's cholesterol. The site
allows people to enter their cholesterol levels and gives advice on how
to lower them. It offers recipes, exercise plans, guidance for reading
food labels and explanation about drugs. The site, available at
www.nhlbi.nih.gov, can be found by clicking on "What's New" on the NHLBI
page. More than 13 million Americans have coronary heart disease, and at
least 80% of them would be helped by getting their cholesterol down, the
government says, but only a third to a half get active treatment.

Does the foewardness of the post make the politics self-evident?

Does the vicariousness of politics make for a certain reality that makes for
movements of history?

Does the earnestness of desiring symbolists imbue their politics/?

Does the surplus of comfortable poetics poets make for antithesis for
forwards?

Does the the multiple critical apperception of structural inequality rendered
as sublimated ideological mystification allow for self-evidence?

Does the historical imprecation of always already make the hyper-ironic
reactionaries know to dismiss the poetry of foewards?

Wasn't there some type of binding called Graymount (Graymont?) covers?
Publishers used them to bind review copies, I think. I think libraries
also used them so that paperbacks would have more durable covers. I just
tried to find the source in my old Pushcart "Publish It Yourself
Handbook," but I couldn't find it. Although I think it's in there
somewhere. Of course, the copy I have was printed in 1980, so the company
(also called Graymount) may no longer be in business.

I'll keep looking.

Hi-Mark Prejsnar here.. (apologies to Kevin Killian..)

My new chapbook is out today from a new small press in Atlanta, 3rdness.
It is a single long poem, Burning Flags.  Anyone who expects (either as
subscriber or contributor) to receive John Lowther's magazine will receive
a copy of my chapbook gratis with the second issue.  That's gonna be
mailed out in about four days.

(This is The Magazine Formerly Known as Syntactics...From this point
forward the title will consist of the same letters but in a different
order for each issue: issue 2 is called Itsynccast)

Only paid subscribers who have a sub for at least two issues will get the
chap...Folks with exchange arrangements will have to order it separately.

To get a copy of Burning Flags, send a check for $5.00 made out to John
Lowther, to:

3rdness

with lee ann brown being sought, let me say that her new book,
polyverse, gets a very nice review in the sept 28 issue of publishers

x-resistant generation, this book*s polyversity combines optimism, a
collage *pop* sensibility, shameless narcissism and a tremendous
generosity rare in books of poetry today."

The NEXT WORD curated by Johanna Drucker
NEUBERGER MUSEUM of ART, September 20, 1998 to January 31, 1999

The NEXT WORD is an interdisciplinary exhibition of work in visual art,
artists' books, visual poetry, and graphic design by artists who are
examining the ways texts and images produce meaning in contemporary
society. The daily landscape of late 20th-century American culture is
saturated with visual and verbal messages and many of the works in this
exhibition reflect this daily experience with the look of language as an
image. Artists have long been responsive to the visual properties of
written language while poets and designers are intrigued by the inherent
tension between reading a text for meaning and looking at its visible form.
Whether committed to individual expression or serving commercial interests,
artists in various fields make use of many of the same tools from
conventional to digital media. Thus artworks, commercial productions, and
advertising converse through a shared vocabulary of forms, while they
remain distinct through their motivations and messages.
        -- Johanna Drucker, from the catalogue for The Next Word

The first of what I hope will be several works by the Uruguayan visual
poet and mail artist Clemente Padín is among the Guest Artist work of
Vispo. First up is his essay "The Options of Mail Art," with an
introduction I wrote, at
http://www.speakeasy.org/~jandrews/vispo/ClementePadin/ClementeIntroToOptionsOfMailArt.html

Just wanted to add something to Standard's post:

If you want more info about the L.A. Books readings, check out the web site:

http://www.litpress.com

You'll also find photos from previous readings at Cafe Balcony. And, as
always, we post annoucements of new publications by literary presses
(newly updated).

Tricky-Dicky, Tricky-Dick, come out, open Bill's Gates
Pray tell, how your contrary garden do grow?
Compere our vegetate seeds, mix our Fates
Dick, blow on that schtick, tit-willow tit-willow.

If you're tired of a two-way, call out Tricky-Dick
When in search of a new way, a less schticky schtick
He'll huff you and puff you, you just take your pick
All hail!, the adaptor, your friend, Tricky-Dick.

Lewd Pinky put the boxes in the Capitol and the world rolled away.
Hanky-Panky sweeps these broken worlds for love. Tricky-Dick oil your eye
from that buttercup shell. Lewd Pinky does the cigar dance, Asia falls to
its knees. Hanky-Panky corroborates sex-change truth with advocates of
sun-dried life. Tricky-Dick, calling the hail from the hallways of the
malls of America.

Tricky-Dicky, Tricky-Dick, come out, open Bill's Gates
Pray tell, how your contrary garden do glow?
Compere our vegetate seeds, mix our Fates
Dick, blow on that schtick, tit-willow tit-willow.

Lewd Pinky busts through the door and Russia goes south. Humpty-Panky
clutching at King's bannisters of sentimental poetry in a last ditch
attempt to pre-empt the great fall. Lewd Pinky looking up deflation in
American Heritage Dictionary, news fit to squint. Hanky-Panky runs a
spellcheck on his memoirs, finds continual confusion as to whether pinky or
Panky was his avowed intent.

If you're tired of a two-way, call out Tricky-Dick
When in search of a new way, a less sticky schtick
He'll huff you and puff you, you just take your pick
All hail, the adaptor, your friend, Tricky-Dick.

Lewd Pinky tripped and packaged no need to leave the baby house. Tricky-Dick,
hiding in the shadows of your shadows, with his banjo string twanging.
Senator Hanky-Panky kisses Blair Rabbit during total eclipse of the moon,
offspring from wind expectant. We take you there, behind the picket fence
of Tricky-Dick. Lewd Pinky plump as LA, sharp as berets. "Hanky-Panky put
as gold" the children chant, each time a ball gleams through their project
hoop.

Tricky-Dicky, Tricky-Dick, come out, open Bill's Gates
Pray tell, how your contrary garden do grow?
Compere our vegetate seeds, mix our Fates
Dick, blow on that schtick, tit-willow tit-willow.

Lewd Pinky gnawing squirrel for dinner as the place goes nuts. The Tale of
Little Brave Hanky-Panky, over 3 billion copies sold worldwide! Lewd Pinky
floating boats economists had forgotten to plug. Hanky-panky in a fit of
peek, caught nappying with Woody Allen down at the neon strip reading
'shrimp in the house'.

If you're tired of a two-way, call out Tricky-Dick
When in search of a new way, a less sticky schtick
He'll huff you and puff you, you just take your pick
All hail, the adaptor, your friend, Tricky-Dick.

Lewd Pinky grand juried, squaring the circle jerk. "Hanky-the rope-Panky
saves the end of the day, read all abort it!". Tricky-Dick peucing the
blandishments of a twisted artefact. Lewd Pinky Nancy's eyes gone Democrat,
smile like a bruise. Hanky-Bannister, pissed as case of built, sycophants
notwithstanding, hick as a stub. Tricky-Dick peucing the blandishments of a
tristed Arniefact.

Tricky-Dicky, Tricky-Dick, come out, open Bill's Gates
Pray tell, how your contrary garden do glow?
Compere our vegetate seeds, mix our Fates
Dick, blow on that schtick, tit-willow tit-willow.

Lewd Pinky moving millions into Treasury Bills. Bull market  - Hanky-Panky
drives the dream tomb home. Lewd Pinky's signature a genre of memoir
everybody speeds. Thank God for Hanky-Panky! Lewd Pinky and the
Sudanese it's sticky. Hanky declares war on off-colour duds, official, the
Panky pledge in full, inside. Lewd Pinky's mouth an oval full of lampoon.
'Hanky-Panky go home, phone (phoneme) the raft son. Lewd Pinky, Lewd Pinky,
they moan in Indiana; Lewd Pinky Lewd Pinky, sanctimonious Connecticut
cries. Hanky-Panky, Hanky-Panky runs for term, the low-down on those
impacted knees. Lewd Pinky red rude, blue nude Lewd Pinky. Hanky-Panky
sings the folks back home. Lewd Pinky put up, Lewd Pinky downloaded, Lewd
Pinky on bar stools, Lewd Pinky fast food. Vote H-P, the man who stands for
Higher Purchase, vote for H-P it can't get any better, H-P, H-P, it won't
get any worse.


Interlude buzzes the phone off the hook, the voice on the line, the ear in
a crook.  "Er, listen, H-P, it's Tricky Dick; can you please explain what's
up with this shtick?  I'm thinking you saps maybe just need a third, and
I'm beating the Bush, it's bad bad bad.  Let me have a refrain if a

Writing in a Garret or Garrotted


If anyone out there needs proofreading or copyediting, please let me know.
If anyone out there needs internet advice or advice for the internet love-
lorn, please let me know.
Honestly small charges under all conditions including internet consulting.
Circumstances are relatively dire here. Please backchannel.

Please disseminate and pass on my work as quickly as possible wherever
possible before the Y2K problem blows up the hard drives. Since I'm fairly
marginal, any stolen republished texts greatly appreciated. Once I'm dead
also you may have my body to do with what you will, but it's a poor body
and there's not much in the doing.

Meanwhile, trying to organize a panel on the future of the net - below
some topics - request for comments -

Community - What emerging forms of community will come into existence?
Virtual Reality - What enhanced modes of perception will exist?
Access - How will the rest of the world be wired? Will it? With what
 consequences?
Geopolitics - How will the global political and economic climates change
 as a result of a world-wide network?
Information Wars - What sorts of hacking, vulnerabilities, and propaganda
 moves will occur? How will these interact with "real" vandalisms and
 wars?
Subjects and History - Will "history" still exist? Will the "subject"?
 Will capital tend to dominate the online user, and will he or she be
 "inserted" into capital?
Resistance and Culture - What forms of resistance and culture will occur?
Cyborgia - What forms of technology will transform the body itself into
 the networked body?

That's about it - if the panel flies, I'll let you know. Have a couple of
chapbooks appearing, I'll let you know; I'm more than greatful for them.

Are there swat teams for flies?

Did I already submit this? If so, please ignore.

We really need some good archival or letters as cultural artifact type
stuff if anyone has any ideas (we need less work that breaks words into
letters--already got a healthy sampling).

Chain /6: Letters

—Jonathan Swift

You say I confess the little mistake and omit the large-Because I see
Orthography-
—Emily Dickinson

But as well as being both material and abstract, letters have another
important characteristic: they are collective. There is a collective
store of letters (the linguistic system) and this is what allows
communication between subjects, and interpretation.
—Jean Jacques Lecercle

Meaning is never simple (except in mathematics), and the letters which
form a word, though each of them is rationally insignificant . . . keep
searching, in us, for their freesdom, which is to signify something
else.
—Roland Barthes

I am composed of nine letters.
—Susan Howe

Epistolary exchanges, alphabets, symbols, orthographies, archival finds,
typographies, correspondences, lettrist hypergraphies, the letter of the
law, fonts, emblems, handwriting, inscriptions, glyphs, gossip, notes,
rebuses, phonetics, mesostics, acrostics, graphemes, anagrams,
hypograms, scarlet, purloined, valentines, letters from camp, letters
from the front . . .

As always, we especially encourage collaborative, interdisciplinary, and
mixed media work.

Please send poems, essays, performance texts, film or video stills,
scripts, camera ready visual art, musical scores, choreographic notes,
proposals, etc., by December 1, 1998. Please send copies to both Jena
Osman and Juliana Spahr;  send only visual art to Janet Zweig (addresses

Different Languages Website

We are working on setting up a website of multilingual works. The
website will present a bibliography, out of print works, testimony and
assignments from people using multilingual works in the classroom, and
criticism. Please send work—poems, prose, essay, plays, camera ready
visual art, performance texts, film or video stills, clips, and/or

notes, teaching statements, bibliographies or bibliography entries,
suggestions for reprints of out of print works—for consideration to us

Is a fine one, this was in public that I had my arms around him and he was
a wonderfully warm, resilient armful, but I dont want his body after he's
dead.

In fact the whole problem of dying is that one leaves (generally speaking)
a corpus delecti behind.

Alan, I've downloaded some of your writings and will b-c you as to
which....give me a week, I'm deadlined territory right now.  Not much

Dear List:

I'm posting some info about the upcoming Geraldine R. Dodge Festival that
is taking place at Waterloo Village, Stanhope, NJ. Though I'm well-aware
that the poetry of some of the participants may send some list members into
doing uncontrollable and illegal acts, I'm hoping that this info might be
forwarded on to those with an interest in the poetry mainstream. If you are
teaching creative writing classes, I hope you let your students know
aboutthis event -- which is the largest poetry festival in North America.


As a matter of truth-in-advertising, I am a publicist for the event.

Among the over 60 readers are

Amiri Baraka
Sharon Olds
Bei Dao
W. S. Merwin
Eliot Weinberger
Alicia Ostriker
Galway Kinnell
Marge Piercy
Robert Pinsky
Adrienne Rich
Faye Chiang
Denise Duhamel
Bob Holman
Mark Doty
     &
Lucille Clifton

There are also open readings, workshops, talks and other poetry related events.

The festival  runs from Thursday September 24 thru Sunday September 27.
Events run from 8am to about 10pm.

Waterloo Village is a beautiful site and if you bring along non-poetry type
friends, they can wander around the pond, lake and restored section of the
Morris Canal. There is food and refreshments available, as well as a large
poetry book store run by Borders.

Waterloo Village is in Sussex County and is off Exit 25 of Route 80. Follow
signs to Stanhope/Waterloo Village.

There is a Poetry Bus that is leaving from the Port Authority Bus Terminal
which will be showing the "Poetry Heaven" video made at the last festival.
The ride takes about an hour and fifteen minutes

A full schedule is available at: www.grdodge.org. You can e-mail the
festival offices at festival@grdodge.org.

A day pass for Th-Sat is $16. There is a $10 ticket for evening events as
well as all-day Sunday. A festival pass is $50.  There are reduced rates

Hi, this is Dodie.  Before I announce the beginning of Small Press
Traffic's 24th season, I'd like to mention a group video show that's
happening this Thursday (the 17th) at ATA (Artist's Television Access),
right down the street from SPT at 992 Valencia.  It's an evening of shorts
by a variety of local video makers.  In one, by Kota Ezawa, Kevin Killian
plays the head of Muni, whose secretary murders him with snake venom and
dumps his body in Golden Gate Park.  Commuters, come indulge your
fantasies!  (Muni is the increasingly dreadful San Francisco transit
system.)

Roberto Tejada
Rodrigo Toscano

We are pleased to begin this new series of poetry and wine evenings at
Yerba Buena with Rodrigo Toscano and--in a rare visit to San Francisco--the
art writer and poet Roberto Tejada.

Roberto Tejada was born in Los Angeles, California (1964). He has published
critical reviews and writings on contemporary Latin American artists and
photographers in Bolet=EDn de Curare, La jornada, Artes de Mexico, Luna
cornea (Mexico),Third Text (UK) Flash Art (US-Italy) Arte Internacional and
Art Nexus (Colombia). After ten years in Mexico City, editing Mandorla: New
Writing From the Americas, an annual of advanced poetry and poetics, Tejada
lives now in Austin where he's the assistant curator at the Wittliff
Gallery of Southwestern and Mexican Photography at Southwest Texas State
University in San Marcos. His poetry slows down the "reckless velocity of
the social" with the figures and tropes of international (post) modernism.
This writing pingpongs from a short, fragmentary, careful line a la Beckett
to vast postapocalyptic caverns of fantasy and Bataillean distress. His
enemy? The implacable, trivial "exoticism" demanded by the market, hell on
serious art production.

Rodrigo Toscano's poetry, like his work in the labor movement, has become a
cutting edge laboratory for social action. Does "poetry make nothing
happen"? Don=B9t tell that to Toscano, whose dizzying, polyvocal poetry
begins with the speech of two nations and deconstructs it to a
revolutionary music. Toscano's work has won him many fans among the
"Language" and "post-Language" poets, but it's a nightmarish mirror of the
social realities behind both the headlines and the stories we don=B9t hear
about. Originally from San Diego, Toscano's forthcoming books include The
Disparities (Sun and Moon), and Partisans (O Books). His work has appeared
in journals such as New American Writing, Chain, West Coast Line, Poetics
Journal, The Washington Review, Zyzzyva, Big Allis, Tripwire, Object/Torque
and others. He is currently at work on an as yet untitled book commissioned
by Atelos Press.

Subject:      Keep The British Library Free
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

KEEP THE BRITISH LIBRARY FREE!

September 15th 1998




Dear Poet


As you may know, the Board of the British Library is currently
considering a proposal to charge readers 300 pounds a year for use of
the reading rooms. This proposal was put forward in a Strategic Review
Consultation Paper issued in mid-July and which called for responses by
28th August. The decision on whether to recommend to the government the
introduction of charges will be made at a final meeting of the Board on
October 16th.

KEEP THE BRITISH LIBRARY FREE! has been set up to campaign against the
introduction of any form of charging. The Campaign believes that
charging for use of the reading rooms would alter irrevocably the nature
of the Library, as well as contravene the directives of the 1972 British
Library Act, which established a national centre for reference, study
and bibliographic and other information services. Any charging scheme,
whatever exemptions might be offered, would inevitably exclude some
individuals on the grounds of inability to pay. Over and above that,
every tax-payer has, of course, already paid for use of the reading
rooms - by contributing 80 million pounds a year to the Library.

Despite the fact that the consultation period took place at a time when
most academics, writers, and students were away, the Campaign has
rallied strong opposition to this proposal. At the end of August, it
organised a successful public meeting, attended by over 200 people, and
addressed by Frances DSouza, Frank Kermode, and Roy Hattersley, among
others. And on 28th August, a 150-strong lobby presented the Board with
a petition of over 6000 signatures and 250 letters of protest. In
addition, there have been many letters in the press about the issue, and
several lengthier articles. A recent broadcast about the Campaign on the
BBC World Service reached over 140 million listeners worldwide.

We would very much like you to help us in the Campaign. We are sure you
subscribe to the view that libraries are fundamental to a thriving
democracy, culture, civilisation and economy and agree that charges at
the national library would set a  precedent for local public libraries
to introduce charges of their own. More particularly, as a publisher, I
am sure you would wish to support the many writers who use the British
Library - as such individuals are essential producers in the industry
itself. Your primary suppliers, in fact.

It is very important, therefore, that we keep up the pressure on the
British Library Board in order to ensure that the introduction of
charges does not continue as an option. We need your support. Here is
how you can help the Campaign:

(1) Please send a message of support to Keep the British Library Free!
c/o Ian Wollington, Flat 3, 91 Richmond Road, London E8 3AA e-mail:
wolly@wollington.demon.co.uk

(2) Respond to the Strategic Review Consultation Paper. Although the
consultation period has formally ended, the Paper says that it would
still welcome responses after this date, though by now  it is vital that
you do so as soon as possible. A copy of the Strategic
Review Consultation Paper can be accessed on the Internet at
http://www.bl.uk

Responses can be by fax 0171 412 7251; or by e-mail at:
strategic.review@bl.uk

For further information and details, you can access our website on:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Aegean/8435/Library.html

(3) Come to the rally on the afternoon of 14th October, two days before
the final decision is made. We plan to gather in the piazza of the
British Library at 2pm. We will have speakers to address the meeting. It
is vital, therefore, that as many people as possible attend. We need to
show the strength of the opposition to these charges. We hope therefore
that you and other members of your organisation will be able to attend.
You may even wish to speak at the meeting.

(4) Finally, we do need funds to finance the campaign - to pay for
leaflets, posters, the hire of meeting halls, and so on. Please send any
donation, however small, to Keep the British Library Free!, c/o Bryan
Smith, 26 Devonia Road, London N1 8JH

If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
either: - Ian Wollington on 0171 2499592 or wolly@wollington.demon.co.uk

or Peter Preston at VERTICALINE@HOTMAIL.COM. Many thanks.

Yours sincerely,

todd,

i seem to only be able to write to others on earthlink.
please send a note to poetics indicating that I cannot reply to anyone who
isn't on earthlink and thus my absence from email for the last week.

I do not have a place to live and have no access to my account most of the
time.

a message comes on the screen saying, "so and so" is not acceptable to your
STMP server. Please fix it. etc.  but I'm simply replying, etc. so I don't
know what to do. I don't have a phone so I cannot call them...

help

I'm trying to organize a real panel on this subject for the spring, here
in New York - proposing this to the School of Visual Arts. It would be in
real space; there might be a Net component - I've done that a lot before,
and the Cybermind conference we held in Perth, Australia, involved every-
thing from CuSeeMe video to Real Audio to newsgroups, a MOO, etc. (I was
there in real life.) So we'll see...

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

05:31 AM ET 09/16/98



            By Matt Pottinger
            BEIJING, Sept 16 (Reuters) - ``Is Lewinsky with the KGB?''
screams a headline in a popular Chinese magazine.
            As the White House sex scandal unfolds, the racier
publications on Beijing newstands are having a field day with
the story, even as staid newspapers such as the People's Daily
report the simple facts without the tawdry details.
            Packed with gossip on U.S. President Bill Clinton's plight,
the latest issue of Guandong Writer magazine would make Western
tabloid editors green with envy.
            The cover story is entitled ``Clinton's Sex Scandal: White
House or Palace of Lust?''
            Its most sensational allegation: Former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky was sent to Washington, when she was a child in
the 1970s, as a Cold War agent on a mission to sexually ensnare
the president and destabilise U.S. politics.
            ``Information has exposed Monica Lewinsky as a spy assigned
by the former Soviet Union. Her mission was to drag a U.S.
president through the mud!'' the article said.
            The story was attributed to a retired KGB official who now
runs a karaoke bar in Moscow.
            Beijing is buzzing with the story, which is taken as fact by
many residents.
            ``Isn't Lewinsky a Russian spy?'' said 38-year-old Xu
Tieliang, as he dug into his pockets for cash to buy cigarettes
at a street market.
            ``I read it in one of the little papers. Maybe the American
newspapers are scared to print it,'' he said.
            Clinton is a familiar and well liked figure in China, where
he appeared uncensored on national television during a
groundbreaking visit in June.
            Officially, China is silent on the sex scandal. ``We don't
comment on that,'' said a foreign ministry official on Tuesday
in response to a reporter's question.
            State media largely ignored the story until U.S. independent
counsel Ken Starr issued his report alleging potential grounds
for Clinton's impeachment.
            Even then, stories in the Communist Party mouthpiece, the
People's Daily -- a benchmark of political correctness in China
-- have been terse and buried on the inside pages. Lurid details
of oral sex have been ignored.
            The popular media, including tabloids and city broadsheets,
tested the limits of official tolerance by initially running
news briefs.
            Sensing the coast was clear, they abandoned caution, and now
Clinton's follies are grist for radio talk-shows and full-page
newspaper spreads.
            The subject matter has ranged from salacious gossip to
poignant political commentary.
            The Yangcheng Evening News, a southern daily, on Tuesday
splashed fuzzy pictures apparently skimmed from the Internet
portraying Clinton with a ``mystery woman'' it dubbed ``the
second Monica Lewinsky.''
            Other papers have taken a crack at putting the scandal in
context for Chinese readers, while poking fun at U.S. hysteria.
            ``Sometimes you simply don't know whether to laugh or cry
over Western democracy. In what is supposedly the 'sexually
liberated' West, people are really making a mountain out of a
molehill,'' said the Guandong Writer.
            A commentary in China Women's News entitled ``Poor Fellow''
starts out by moralising about Clinton's excesses, but ends up
praising the United States for having ``stricter supervision
than any country on earth'' over its government.
            If a president could be skewered for something as slight as
a character problem, the commentary said ``what official over
there would ever dare to engage in corruption.''
            In a wry jab at Chinese politics, the author suggested that
Clinton could avoid public scrutiny if he were a Chinese
official instead of an American one.
            ``It wouldn't hurt for you to give up the presidency and
become head of a Chinese township or village. Maybe then you
won't be sullied for a little 'morality problem','' it said.

i am interested in hearing from poets who have had their works published
by small presses (or other) and how they deal with publishers/presses that
quite literally re-write the work WITHOUT consulting with you th poet
first. i am sad to say i have had this experience only recently. perhaps
my intentions weren't clear. but i always thot (i took it for granted)
that before you are published publishers talk to you, consult with you on
whatever revisions or whatever. in one instance i stated: "i do not want
you to publish this essay." (yes, i had to turn a press down! i just
didn't think the essay was worth it in the end), but they went ahead and
printed my work. i feel awful. like i've just been walked on.

but maybe my experience is the exception. i have had one very good
experience with a press. they sent me a copy of what they wanted to do
with my work, and it was better than my original intention. but they sent
me detailed notes and a proto-type of sorts so that i cld see it before
hand. so i am happy that there is this press out there. with an ethics
. . . that puts the work first.

My experience with Burning Press was outstanding.  Luigi (Bob) Drake took
incredibale care with rather particular needs of my mss--some very odd
spacing/arrangement which went completely out of whack when the font and
such were altered.  Luigi worked to get the text back to, at times better
than, my original arrangement, and I was kept informed via email and proof
copies every step of the way, including decisions about cover art,
materials, bindings, etc.  I couldn't have asked for a more conscientious
and concerned editor.

I have had only one bad experience, years ago--I don't even remember the
journal, but it was, as I recall, fairly mainstream.  They had obviously
scanned my poem in with some OCR software and then barely attempted to
correct the errors caused by it.  The proofs were incorrect and my
corrections were ignored.

So, from my experience, which is extremely limited, it seems that small
presses are more careful--this makes sense to me, anyway

Subject:      Textual abuse
Content-Type: text/plain

Both SUNY Buffalo and the Archive for New Poetry at UCSD have a copy of
an early (1967 or 68) book of mine that was published by Jim
Orsino-Sorcic at Gunrunner Press in Milwaukee. Jim was real young and
new to the small press scene (as was I) when he did the book and he
re-did linebreaks to make it fit his format. I felt totally violated at
the time and still feel today as if I were the subject of an unwilling
collaboration. Must have been how Rexroth felt at Zukofsky's reworking
of his poem in the Objectivist Anthology.

I've left that work off of my biblio (as you will note on the site at
EPC) and have never considered it _my_ work. I've made a point of
notating both extant copies in those archives and I don't have a copy of
the book myself.

And I've been much more careful after that.

I do think that small press people are generally (not entirely) more
careful than those in the larger presses where the flow of
responsibility gets more distributed and less personally felt. But
there's not much you can do about it, ultimately, beyond letting other
people know which presses do that.

CENSORSHIP AND ATTACK ON MAIL ART IN CHILE

In response of the systematic and offensive political persecution and
the intolerance that for various years have been going on at the University
of Chile's Fine Art School (actions promoted and spurred by reactionary,
totalitarian an pro Pinochet sectors) on March 98, the Mail Art Exhibit
"Stop: liberty, diversity and pluralism" was held at the Santiago's
Museum of Contemporary Art, in defense of the constant attacks by sectors
in power. As a result, Humberto Nilo, the Director of the U. de Chile's
Fine Art School and organizer of the event, was dismissed from his position
along with the Museum's Director and the Curator of the exhibit: Mrs. Rosar=
io
Letelier and Mr. Ernesto Munioz.

The brillant track records of the dismissed wich includes their strong
defense of Human Rights during the chilean dictatorship; recuperating
Guillermo
Deisler memoirs, and hundreds of other artistic manifestation in defense
of Human Rights and the dissemination of the best in Contemporary Art,
were not taken into account.

It is paradoxical, not to mention denigrating, that after 17 years of
military dictatorship in Chile, and after reaching (as certain oficialist
sectors proclaim)  democratic and social harmony levels worthy of being
emulated by the rest of the continent; we have to experience the sad specta=
cle
in wich cultural spaces are closed through economic strangulation, harrassm=
ent
and dismissal of distinguished artists, simply because they don't share
the "official line" and open or covert censorship of critical manifestation=
s
on what's established and current.

These cases, are not only attacks on people of proven professional and
artistic excellence, they constitute a frontal attack on the principles
that ground culture, in addition to being a crass outrage on the libertaria=
n
aspirations of an broad sector of the national and international artistic
community. It is time we sponsor and stimulate the global coscience among
all those artists who believe on the diversity and pluralism in art, to
confront outrages such as that have just taken place in Chile. It has to
be done now, since with the sophisticated strategies for manipulation and
control, in the hands of the new inquisitioners of culture... tomorrow
could be too late!

The intolerance and desdain for cultural diversity are achieving strategic
permanence in those places that have historically been destinated to
protecting
diversity. Perhaps that's why there's been a strong push to silence them.
What about critical view and reflection? Or is it that we are facing the
beginning of a world regime with a cultural policy that is predominently
non-critical, blind and "light" aligned with the purposes of Neo-liberalism=
?

Faced with the fear that the arrogance and brutality of the chilean
regime could put in peril the future of Humberto Nilo, Rosario Letelier
and Ernesto Munioz, we begin this World Campaign to repudiate censorship
and personal attacks against any artist, regardless of whether he practices
Mail Art, anywhere on the face of the Earth, requesting from everyone to
send-in expressions of solidarity and rejection against all sorts of
discriminatory
policies on cultural matters, so that in some way, their offenders can't
get away with their threats unscathed.

Let me second this.
A suggestion for publishers: in the first issue of Broadway Boogie, my
first publishing venture, I made a mistake while typesetting and dropped a
few lines of a poem. I of course included a little tag with a correction,
but that doesn't really make it right. Since then I have always given my
authors proofs of the typeset work (whether in the form of xeroxes or
print-outs) before going to press.

Curious that the Objectivists Anthology should come up in this discussion -- thumbing
through the copy in SFU Special Collections yesterday, I discovered what must be
the largest "errata" insert I've ever seen!  A wonderful found poem!

Like Mark Weiss, I've made mistakes here. I've missed a correction before.
I've also had one occasion of an author who did not want to proofread, and
more mistakes ended up in that book. I've never intentionally changed an
author's text, though, without consulting her or him, and when I've made
design decisions which I felt were not necessarily implied by the text,
I've talked to the author about what I was doing and have obtained approval.

Still, the mistakes are much regretted, and, like Mark, make me take steps
to insure they don't happen again. On the other hand, something I share
with Mark is the desire for perfection in our books; and, from that
perspective, it seems there are always little things (hopefully not big
ones) in each project which make one feel that it could be just a little
better.

And, Ron, there is also a copy of your Gunrunner Press book in the rare
book vaults at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. When I worked there in
the late 1970's and early 1980's I found it and I also had trouble
recognizing it as your work. So if you're ever in Madison, you might want
to stop there and annotate that copy, too.

Abused:

When Norton published the Before Columbus American Book Awards anthology
they included a large selection from my "This Passover Or The Next I Will
Never Be in Jerusalem," though after delight I was dismayed to learn that
they had entirely amputed half of one of the poems I liked the best
("Sweat-Lodge").  Purely a sloppy error -- and apparently they did just as
careless work with Ginsberg (a kind of reassurance).  The errors due to
haste in getting the book out -- so much for getting Nortonized -- but it
just ends up more of a heart-breaking  mess.  I called, wrote, and so far
no errata -- just a promise that maybe in the next printing things could
be fixed up (I don't believe there's been another printing, but even so I
doubt it.).

Norton is a grand place, one of the better places and of course so far out
of corporate clutches, but I have prefered working with smaller presses
(Mercury House is a delight) because most of the time you can exercise far
greater care, far more of a collaborative relationship, far more
appreciation for the writer's body as well as soul.

Except for an unexpected indentation problem on my first chapbook no
problems in textual concerns with my work. In other areas, there have
been doozies tho. Mainly with large publications that have went long
beyond their posted reading schedules and have not responded to queries
as to whereabouts & then publish the piece, or smaller cliquish
magazines that decide not to respond to a submission. Perhaps we need a
shit list to mail around. And a list of respectable places as well-- I
place kudos to Gian Lombardo at Key Satch(el) and Quarter After Eight
for going extra lengths when dealing with pieces which have textual
issues.

As for publishing others, I have only had one major problem which was in
the first full length book. That was when I found out two lines were
lopped off of a piece in Chris Stroffolino's Oops due to a Quark X-press
page quirk I forgot about (the x in the box thang). Unless people count
delays.

For the journal, in a few cases I have offered some writers reserved
edit options and if they want to change the piece I'll publish it. I've
probably made some enemies that way,  and possibly through certain
rejections, but I'm not going to publish some 3rd or 4th rate piece just
because you got books sitting on shelves everywhere. Unlike some places
I do just fine fiscally without publishing a name for name's sake. I
have always related to James Laughlin's notion that "New Directions
books are published _for_ James Laughlin" and hope the concept hasn't
passed with him. Let be be finale of seem. Let someone else be the
curator of crap. If you don't respect the journal you send to enough to
send something decent or your ego is too pasty and fragile (or HUGE) to
send more than once, what do you expect? Rejecting things is the same as
understanding that when a poem says "I saw God," it's the poem who saw
God.

Be well

In 1992 I did a book with Singing Horse Press. Gil Ott edited & was a joy to
work with. He sent a proof beforehand--which I thought was a given.  Now I'm
doing one with John Noto's Vatic Hum press, and one of the fun parts is going
up to the city & having lunch & looking over the manuscript as we go. Maybe the
moral is that good poets make good poetry editors.

A poem in my book _Rubbing Torsos_ begins "The dead toy gaily with
us" and ends "and broke all my dead toys." However, when I read through
the sheets at Ithaca House before binding I found "all my old toys." I
have to admit a secret delight in the resulting erratum slip that reads:
"For _old_ read _dead_"

I have used the section at the back of M.H. Abrams _A Glossary of Literary
Terms_ with some success.  The entries are concise and list the more
prominent works in each specific area.  I've been using the 6th edition
which is getting a bit dated, perhaps, but for an intro style undergraduate
course, I think it covers the bases quite well.

Dear Pierre,

Thanks for sending along the St. Lazaire Press books.  Those books
begin to give me a sense of the many directions that emanate from
Robert Kelly....  And Tom Meyer's work is wonderful--sadly, one of
far too many well kept secrets in American poetry.

Is there something I can send in return?  Do you have a copy of
_Early Days of the Lang Dynasty" (Meow Press, 1996)?

Mark et al,

The best theory/criticism anthology that I've seen is Davis Richter's THE
CRITICAL TRADITION, which starts with Plato and runs right up to the near
present (all in an easy 1500 pages). He provides failry concise overviews,
and then often substantial excperts from the theorists he includes. Of
course, it's very canonical (as is to be expected from any such book), but
that's only to say that it provides a fairly solid introduction to the
major trends in Western Lit. Crit. Structuralism and Poststructuralism are
divided into two chapters (15 theorists), and offer a decent account of
semiotics, deconstrcution, etc...

The second part of the essay (Political Dimensions of Langu(im)age) is now a part
of the text of the main essay (Digital Langu(im)age--language and image as
objects in a field), at http://www.webdelsol.com/Perihelion/jimarticle.htm, so I
deleted the posting to the message board of webdelsol of Political Dimensions.

I finished writing The Political Dimensions after the Perihelion deadline had
passed and the first part was already published. Jennifer Ley, the editor of
Perihelion, had to take some time to read and incorporate the new material into
the essay. Which she did. To her credit. If it were the print world, I'd a simply
been out of luck. I had to argue hard for this late inclusion. But I think it's
one of the more important parts of the essay. It is the second to last section.

I wrote it as soon as I understood it. Uruguay's Clemente Padin helped me
understand it...

Jim Andrews

Subject:      Attack against artists
MIME-Version: 1.0

Dear Christina,

I have posted at http://www.speakeasy.org/~jandrews/vispo/clement.html a Web version of
the message Clemente Padin, Irving Weiss, and Viktor Todorovic sent concerning the
dismissals of the Chileans for their involvement in the Mail Art show you seem to mention
below. I think that there are probably a lot of people who would like to support the call
for protest Clemente articulated, but who feel that details concerning the art exhibited
in Santiago, Chile, and the events surrounding the dismissals have not been provided.

In part, Clemente says:

"In response to the systematic and offensive political persecution and intolerance that
for years have been going on at the University of Chile's Fine Art School (actions
promoted and spurred by reactionary, totalitarian and  pro-Pinochet sectors) on March 98,
the Mail  Art Exhibit "Stop: liberty, diversity and  pluralism" was held at Santiago's
Museum of Contemporary Art, in defense against  constant attacks by sectors in power. As
a  result, Humberto Nilo, the Director of the U. of Chile's Fine Art School and organizer
of  the event, was dismissed from his position along with the Museum's Director and the
Curator of the exhibit: Mrs. Rosario Letelier and Mr. Ernesto Munioz."

I have emailed Humberto Nilo for more information, but received no response. Can you
provide more information? Are there works on the Web from the show that people can view?
What was the reception of the show otherwise? What triggered these events? I need more
information.

Can you send digital images of some of the art to me so I can post it on my Web site, and
others can too?

It seems to me an important thing for the people on the poetics listserver, very
important.

Regards,
Jim Andrews

Stephen,

I just checked, and Amazon lists THE CRITICAL TRADITION, 1989 edition, as
out-of-print, and the revised second edition (1997) as only available in
hard covers, for $63.98 -- probably not a good price for students, nor for
me. Do you have any other information about this, as I have known Amazon to
be wrong about out-of-print books before, but usually when they are small
press publications.

Subject:      Beyond the Sun & Moon Sale
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I've just had the great pleasure of receiving Sun & Moon Press's two most
recent books: Joan Retallack's How to Do Things with Words and Myung Mi Kim's
Dura, both of which I have been eagerly awaiting. I keep thinking there must be
some magic to Douglas Messerli's publishing: how can he do so many books? But I
also know that there is no magic, and that Sun & Moon lives within the same
dire poetry publishing economy that many of us on this list are all too
familiar. While at crucial points in its history, Sun & Moon did benefit from
NEA and foundation grants, that time seems more and more remote. And a press
like this, without the kind independent resources that have sustained some
other literary publishers of a comparable scale to Sun & Moon, is dependent on
sales for its survival.

So when Sun & Moon sent those lists of $4 poetry books last week, it seemed to
me that buying multiple copies of those books might be the ideal way to support
Sun & Moon, to ensure that it is able to keep publishing books like the ones on
the lists. While Sun & Moon is actually and officially a nonprofit
organization, fund raising by the press has been negligible. But the sale, it
seems to me, offers a great way of making a contribution to Sun & Moon -- and,
in the bargain, getting books for oneself and also books to give to friends.
It's a little like what Peter Pan says about Tinkerbell: if we want a press
like Sun & Moon to survive, we all have to sprinkle a little fairy dust now, in
the form of bulk buying of those $4 books. That may be the only kind of magic
that works -- the kind that comes from readers who want these books and want
more of them.

For those who want to take another look at the list of books available, check
out the Poetics List archive for this month under messages from Douglas
(http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html) or write to Douglas
Messerli direct (at djmess@CINENET.NET) and I am sure he will return your
request with a copy of the list. (The Sun & Moon website it at
http://www.sunmoon.com )

i guess when that works it works. some typos are just typos and it's hard
to find the trope. and some ideas are better than others.

Ron, your notion of dis-owning the poem when this happens gives me some
comfort. i think you are right, those poems of mine that were published
without any consultation or dialogue are not mine.

WORD SCORE UTTERANCE CHOREOGRAPHY
What is a poem?
Don't answer that.
What isn't a poem? Read on.
I assume that there was utterance before writing. I assume that some, at
least, of that utterance was pleasurable - pleasurable for the utterer or
the auditor or both... There are birds singing in my garden - a thrush on a
stout high branch is stringing complexities of notes in what seems to me
joy. Joy in birds may be different to joy in humans, though I doubt it, but
I am sure that it is there in birds, that birdsong and the utterance of
other creatures often goes beyond mere assertion. Surely the same use of
voice has always been with Homo Sapiens even if I am wrong about the rest of
the creatures.
To say that an act of utterance is, perhaps firstly, pleasurable is not to
deny that it is communication as well... The instigation and communication
of pleasure is a primary act; if we all spent more time making pleasure, if
only for ourselves, we might undermine each other and ourselves less.
And then we had writing, scripts of one sort or another. Is script a
notational system for utterance?
I think that often it is not, because it is inadequate for the purpose; but
it may give an indication of what the utterance may be. However, the
performance, if it is to follow the script, requires intelligent informed
reading.
What we can say of any script is that it is other than the utterance
referring to it. A script is partly a hyper-utterance system. With a script,
we can, to some extent, escape death: Ovid, dead 2000 years, speaks to me
often though the signal to noise ratio is poor; and, of course, I cannot
speak back. With a script we may begin to simulate our presence with
another. We may read what others we have never met have written.
But scripts, as I have said, are limited. Timbre is lost. Accent is
problematic. Tone and intention may only be indicated by elaborate and
unwieldy means. Over time, pronunciation and stress change and words'
meanings are modified. Body language is lost.
So much of our received and transmitted information is non-verbal and/or
visual, should we not make use of non-verbal and visual material in our
poetry?
Why not modify and extend the written language / script / notational system?
And, at the same time, why not perform similar operations upon our concept
of what constitutes the spoken language? Let us recognise the importance of
what we say which does not use recognisable words, grunts, sighs and so on,
gestures and less easily perceivable signals. A film camera extends it and
we are happy, and the wiser for it. Our language, English, Spanish, French
or whatever it is, is only part of our total potential utterance.
As we extend our concept of language to include all the possibilities of our
utterance, let's allow pictures. Illustrations if you like, but, better than
that, perhaps the texts can be bade to tell their own pictures. Evocatively
and pictographically. Prompts. Doodles. Cartoons. Some visual poets work in
that area, extending meaning and the means of meaning, but limiting the
performed utterance to the process of reading. There is much fine work of
that sort.
Emboldening, italicising and underlining are widely acknowledged to have
significance in linear texts though many poets eschew it. I wonder why?
Musicians make their lives easier by writing instructions on scores,
extending the notational system. Why shouldn't poets? Can that basic
formatting not be expanded? Larger type, louder voice? What about type at an
angle to the vertical? What is the difference between the hand-written text
and the printed or typed text? What difference does a deliberate smudge make
to a text? What might be done with variations in the grey scale? What might
be done with variations in the grey scale! The text... does the text have to
be a text? I read that in Mecca the sky line seen from certain angles writes
There is no God but Allah and Mohamed is his prophet. I hope that's true.
The text could be the room around you. The text might include other
performers. The text could be your own body. Alphabet soup anyone?
About 100 years ago, Picasso and Braque saw this from another similar angle
and put words into their fields of vision. Why should not poetry contain
painterly material?
If poetry can be set to music, then music can be held (as you hold someone
you love rather than as you hold a prisoner) in a poem, and be, in certain
cases, inseparable from it.
Hypertext demonstrates the viability of this idea; but this work, whatever
it is, and among other things it is visual poetry, has been available to us
as a possibility all the time; and here is a whole book of it. A hole book,
because some of the work it contains is only partly in the book; the rest of
such works remains potential, in the book, and must be performed beyond the
book to be realised, made kinetic.
Not all the poets in this book would agree with what I am saying. There's
glory for you.
I see no reason to be limited to words alone in poetry any more than we
should limit ourselves to particular pronunciations of words. It depends
what kind of communication you want. It depends to what degree you want to
tell the linguistic sea not to flow... Our utterance of texts from the past
is to a greater or lesser extent guess work because we can no longer hear
the original utterance; we only have some marks on pages and walls and our
deductive ingenuity. In translation, we may compromise much of the sound /
music for the sense and vice versa.
I do not want to make non-verbal expression mandatory for poets, merely to
extend the permission for such use to take place. A fellow poet who had
witnessed a performance in which I participated remarked that he had at
various times made all the sounds I had made; but only, as he put it, in the
bedroom; and, he went on, it had not occurred to him, nor did he feel ready,
to make such sounds before an audience. I took this as praise and as an
encouragement to persist.
Our repertoire of non-verbal sounds is extremely interesting. Analysis of it
would, I am sure, support the belief that pain and pleasure, and love and
hatred, have close kinship.
I do not think that there is an equivalence between any set of marks and any
set of sounds except one that we impose. Little is further from my desire
than to propose a crude synaesthetic system. The audible utterance and the
visible mark / gesture are signs of our responses and signs to which we may
respond, no more.
Performance of the same text may vary quite widely from day to day and
performer to performer. To some this might be seen as a weakness or failure,
but I welcome it. Let us give poetry, from those who wish to, physicality
and the frailties and/or variety of physicality.
The variation between performances of visual texts is likely to be far wider
than one would expect of a linear text... I mean of course a verbal text. Or
do I mean a lexical text. What is the distinction? A microphone will capture
it all whether or not the utterances are in the lexicon; and we have far
less trouble with new (to us) non-dictionary exclamations than we do with
words the dictionary knows and we do not.
In going beyond the dictionary and widely accepted conventional forms, we go
nearer to some extent to communication, being able to ignore the Babel
obstacles. It depends what manner of communication you wish to effect.
I could bog you down with definitions and precise terminology here; instead
I am underlining words on which I might be terminologically attacked, and
some words on which an attack is long overdue, and leave you to read the
dictionary when you have time!
With visual poetry you don't have to start at the top left hand corner of a
page and work down towards the bottom right hand corner. You just start, not
anywhere, somewhere. It's like not having to stay on the pavement. It's like
being where you want be when you want to be - though as a maker you will
soon find that the visual poem inflicts its own constraints; you do not have
freedom. But you can walk through old walls and sometimes hear and see the
sounds rising from the page and hear what is marked there without it being
performed.
Visual poetry encourages us to be calligraphic with our voices and bodies,
and somewhat musical with what we see, making the performance at once more
abstract and more concrete than a performance based on linear lexical text.
Much of what is going on here may not be writing as that is often
understood. It is not painting or drawing, but it is near them. And so with
music. And so with much else. It may be writing.
If we don't have its name yet, so much the better. No one has dominion over
it; it has no nationality; but it is international;
In the beginning was the word for a continuation is an utterance; it is that
it is
What is a poem
Each editor brought a notional list of poets to the making of this book.
Perhaps it was a list of prejudices though I would prefer to think of it as
a list of hypotheses. I was pleased at how easy it was to agree to a list in
common. Subsequently there were additions to that list; but always our
intention was to make available to users of this book another insight.
This book is not intended to define a school nor to provide you with a list
of the best or most significant poets. It may do one or even both, but that
would be a complete accident. There are no real bests, only lists of them;
and significance can be a beam in the eye.
In this book is a selection of poets chosen to give a sense of the variety
of approaches that is possible. We had very limited space and could not
include all that we enjoy.
Faced with the question, put to us sometimes by audiences and generated by
our own deliberations, What is the relationship between the marks on the
page and the sounds one makes when reading the page, here, in this book, is
an answer, a set of answers, providing the beginnings of an answer.
Use this book to increase your understanding of this kind of work and then,
if you wish, build your own pantheon. If this book introduces you to poets,
then so much the better, because many included here are too little known in
this country...
(Personally, beyond the aims stated, I am most unhappy that we have been
unable to locate the Swedish poet Bengt-Emil Johnson for whose work on the
page and in the ear I have the greatest respect. He has contributed
immensely to the extension and enrichment of poetry and I regret that it has
not been possible to demonstrate that here..)
A potential bibliography is huge. We offer instead a handful of references,
believing that they are sufficient to whet your appetite and start you
searching out your own sources of information.
It is the editors hope that you will pay attention to what it is the makers
themselves say they are doing, rather than relying on what others say,
including us. Try to hear recordings and see performances. Experiment with
the techniques yourself because by doing so you will appreciate the richness
and complexity they can generate.

I think a little on line symposium on editorial practice might be a good
idea, and I'll kick it off. But first, a story:

In the early 70s, when I was editing Broadway Boogie, I made it a practice
to send xeroxes of the photocopy to the writers for them to sign off on
before going to press. After I received them back I printed an edition (I
think it was number 2) and sent the contributors their copies, upon which I
received a frantic phone call from one of them, insisting that I scrap the
entire press run: he had found a typo. It seems that I had mistakenly typed
one letter for another, fortuitously or not changing one of his words for
another that fit plausibly into the poem. I apologized and reminded him
that he had signed off on the copy. The best I could do would be to slip in
an errata sheet. But frankly, I told him, you might want to consider my
mistake--although I would never on purpose change your work without your
consent, I think it improves the poem. He wasn't mollified, and he steamed
off to his friends all around NY. All of them looked at it and said,
without exception, you know, this improves the poem. He was chagrined, but
kept the error, and when the poem saw print again in a book it was still
there.

This is not an add for mistakes. I've made more than enough that I won't
allude to even obliquely.

Here's the way I work. I'm real impatient with primadonnas. Anyone who
sends me a manuscript is forewarned that I'm a very active editor. If I
want a book I accept it as is, but that doesn't stop me from respectfully
making the best case I can for what I hope will make it better. This
follows from my assumption that the poem once on the page is no longer a
part of the poet's psyche but an object to be shaped. Thus far all of
Junction's books have been in this sense collaborative, and poets who
weren't at first fond of having me comment insistently on their work have
by and large incorporated my suggestions or noted the problem I had spotted
and have provided a better solution. And they have all been pleased with
the outcome. In no case, by the by, am I taking credit for the work--it has
to be damned good in my estimation for me to accept it as is in the first
place, and my tinkering is just that. And I think I learn at least as much
from the process as the poets do. It's the reason I do the press to begin
with--this, and the exercise of the craft of bookmaking, are what's in it
for me.

Often poets present a larger book than I can print or than the work
merits--very few of us produce 150 good pages of our best verse every two
or three years, and many poets, myself included, winnow the work
exceedingly slowly if they get no input. I of course enforce page limits
were necessary, but some poets have insisted that I take an active part in
determining the final content of the book and the order of poems as well.

As a courtesy to the poets I share text and cover design and jacket copy
with them. But this is my area as publisher. I take these things very
seriously, but I'm also very aware that they are first and foremost a form
of advertizing.

I started out concerned that this process might cost me some friendships.
Instead, it's strengthened existing friendships and created some strong new
ones. In fact, the dialogue with the author usually becomes a very intimate
exchange.

On textual editing: I was just last night re-reading Oppen's "Discrete
Series," and it had never been as apparent to me what a disservice is done
the poems by ND's refusal to give the poems each their own page (Oppen's
thwearted wish). I'm actually dealing with this question, to some degree,
in the Oppen material I'm currently editing, where one of the more
troubling issues has been the extent to which each page is integral as a
unit in and of itself. All previous selections from Oppen's "working
papers" (all of which I've found extraordinary, and would be hesitant in
critiquing), have presented fragmented, aphoristic excpets from the
material which often appear radically different in the genetic documents.
What is lost in such an approach is the process of composition (which is
the process of thought itself), a process often much more disjunctive, much
less condensed, than it might appear from the earlier selections. Also lost
is a certain symbolic quality - i.e. the semantics of visual/material
appearance (some non-literary researchers have actually studied Oppen's
archive, his handwriting in particular, for clues about Alzheimer's...)

Anyway, this just to continue the symposium (as it were). To add to the
Olson story: Nate Mackey is rumoured to have changed "snapping our fingers"
to "snapping out fingers" in 'Alphabet of Ahht' after a mis-type (his own,
however, not a typesetter's or printer's).

Charles,

I didn't know that there was a new edition, but this would make sense. The
old edition was itself only available in hard cover, and might still be
found used through university bookstores for a bit cheaper. But yes, the
cost is a bit prohibitive nonetheless (used goes for $45 or so, I believe).

Anyway, for _content_ it works...

The Case of the Real (Declarative, for Lexie)


"What appears to be a book about words is. So it's. Where there is. What
appears to be awash in philosophy is. This is. It's. How is. It is. Al-
ready, for such a text is. But it is. Perhaps it is. Or rather, the ling-
uistic is. Nor are. There is. Death is. Death is. There is. Technology is.
Technology is. The machine is. It is. Technology is. But this is. This is.
Technology is. The surfaces are. This is. Cataclysm, dissolution, the col-
lapse of the molecular, atomic, are. Being is. Perhaps Being is. Being is.
It is. Intervals are. From moment to moment, speech is. At the heart of
the written, there is. Transformations, becomings, are. There is. Almost
all flows have been lost; this is. Our concern is. Words lead; they are.
Words are. There is. Today is. There is. Not to write is. The beginning of
the book is. What was. There are. Pure process is. One is. To step from
the beginning, to step from this beginning, is. But mathesis is. There is.
Everything and nothing are. Either everything is. Linkage is. One maps
palely against or through the other; technology is. Following Lyotard, one
might say that the real is. Writing is. It is. The scene is. The scene is.
The scene is. It is. It is. It is. It is. The world is. It is. It is. This
is. It is. On the other hand, there are."

I'm pleased to announce a significant new resource at the EPC, Un bureau
sur l'Atlantique, a new bilingual web site created by Juliette Valery. The
Bureau promotes American poetry in France through translation workshops,
events, and different publishing series. The web site is terrific and
provides a good look at the Bureau and its publications as well as the
important work "Taches blanches / Blank Spots" by Emmanuel Hocquard. Come
and visit Un bureau, the current selected resource at the EPC home page,

When reading the page proofs for my The poetics of Self-Consciousness I
never removed a large paper clip sort of thing from the top of the pages.
One of the title headings read Vincente Aleixandre instead of Vicente, but
I never saw it until the book was printed.  So it is Vincente on very
single &%$#@ page of the chapter.  Ouch.

I'm looking at the epigraphs to Gilbert Sorrentino's Aberration of
Starlight--the Apollinaire I know is from "Marizibill" (Alcools), and the
Satie is well known.  But can someone point to the source of the lines
from Vallejo?--

Gil Ott's Singing Horse Press has just published its 19th book in 19 =
years, Linh Dinh's _Drunkard Boxing_, and it's simply fabulous. To give =
you a sense of it, I want to quote two poems:

O HANOI

In the middle of town, or just off to the side,
Is the largest turtle in the world. (Or, maybe,
Just one of the largest.)

We lived in the old quarters, on Potato Street,
Then Coffin Street, then Clown Street,
Then Teleprompter Street.

In a so-called tube house, a house
So narow one must walk sideways
With one's head turned. Like this. We slept
Upright during the Four Thousand Year War, and,
Out of habit, for a thousand years afterward.

You will find my name, that of a ballyhooed scholar
From the 23rd century (AD or BC, I can't remember),
Inscribed on the next-to-last stele
At the Temple of Poesy.


CHATTER OF HONOR

On January 17th, 1978, at 2:32 PM, we were insulted.
On May 4th, 1985, at midnight, we were again insulted.
Our prestige has been retarded.
Our legendary status deterred by patriotic rogues.
Our height has been declined.
We were promised a terrace and chunky soup,
A pair of loafers and two leaflets.
We were led to believe
We had ongoing safe passage through the sewage.
But our guide was hosed as we entered the city.
We wandered until dawn popping every lit window.


These are, as I think those two poems show, uses and contexts to which =
an imagination informed by surrealism (and much more) have not =
previously been put. The book as a whole is like discovering a world you =
never knew existed and which makes absolute sense.

Since it was just printed last week, I'm presuming that it can't be at =
SPD yet, but it certainly will be there soon. And, as the verso says, =
"Individuals may contact the press directly."

Douglas,

Speaking of fabulous, it's wonderful to know that Joan Retallack's _How =
to Do Things with Words_ -- already a legendary work -- has finally also =
become a reality we can all hold, own and read.

if i didn't have jennifer, julu, nikuko, i wouldn't be able to write.
i'd only be able to write my own name, repeatedly, compulsively.
it would decathect, disappear, only a viewpoint of iron and salt
remaining.
there would be nothing but annihilation to the limit, debris, ash left

a lot smarter too

but i don't dream of them, don't talk to them, perhaps there are words
they place in my mind, murmuring, subaudibles, occasions for poetry and

A THING OR TWO UPON THE PAGE
The contributors to this volume have been invited because of their
fascinating, and fascinatingly diverse, approaches to an apparently similar
situation. They produce (at least) two types of text which can be described
as verbal and visual (to leave aside the vocal that surfaces also as an
aspect of these works). That these two types may be reproduced, from
authors' copy, on separate and contiguous pages, might be the only
relationship that can be claimed for them. Yet it is clear from the
statements of poetics that each writer has also produced, that the nature of
that relationship is very seldom one of contingency or peaceful
co-existence. Whereas some artists see themselves as engaged in two (or
three) separate activities, like Franz Mon, others usefully dispute the
distinction that the page divisions of this project have contentiously set
up; the appearance of the fashionable word "hybrid" in the statements of
Spencer Selby and Steve McCaffery testifies to this.
The question is one of medium.  In contributor Johanna Drucker's The Visible
Word, Expcrimcntal Typography and Modern Art 1909-1923, she sees the
typographical experiments of Modernism (which she continues in her own work)
as a material practice with two orders of materiality. The first is the
"stuff of apparency" (Drucker: 45), the "sheer concrete thingness of
printer's type", as another contributor, Edwin Morgan, put it. (Cobbing and
Mayer: 21) Such an order may not exclude questions of historical and
cultural value; the same text on paper, brass or gold surely is validated
differently. Secondly, Drucker reminds us, following Saussure, the text is
bound also by the relational signifying system we call language.  There is
no necessary connection between these material codes; whereas the linguistic
system is rule-bound (in terms of grammar, syntax, etc.) even when the rules
are broken, the realm of the visual is less encoded, although historical
conventions are not absent. A comparison of Tom Leonard's agitprop slogan
poster poem and Clemente Padin's "Destability Stabled" will reveal, in the
first, that the two systems are complementary, and in the second that the
visual expression undermines and complicates the verbal content.
Yet this doubleheaded materiality is ever present in language, in Leonard's
piece, and in all physical inscription of language. Writing is not on paper,
like a flat projection upon a screen, but is in the paper, as it were.
"Materiality of language," as McCaffery says, "is that aspect which remains
resistant to an absolute subsumption into the ideality of meaning .... To
see the letter not as phoneme but as ink, and to further insist on that
materiality, inevitably contests the status of language as a bearer of
uncontaminated meaning." (Perloff: 129) As some contributors say, such
"contamination" of Drucker's two systems is present in the physical
appearance on the page of the "verbal" texts. This is not simply a question
of design, layout, presentation, but of a visual syntax. There are no
non-meaningful elements of a poem, in this sense, and questions of the
spatial orientation of language on the page affect the reader's active
engagement, and can be used to deliberately affect that engagement in many
ways.  This is relevant whether one is faced with Mallarmé, Olson, computer
or hypertext poetry; or, as a teacher, the unreadable purple loops of an
embellished exam script!.
The spatial field of the page has often suggested notation, whether it is in
the precise spacing of Jackson Mac Low's "Forties" or the openness of
Cobbing's visual sound-scapes. Both imply eye-movement as text-realisation,
present in both language and the visual, but again more coded in language
(left to right, top to bottom, for example) than in the image (though
conventions of perspective, centre and frame may dictate starting points).
But what happens when language is read in that visual field?
To turn to purely visual work, an escape from the linguistic system into the
more open semiosis of the visual field can, in differing degrees, effect a
critique, or even dismissal of, the constrictions of language. In certain
texts here, language as system is absent, or skeletally present as ink on a
page, or is replaced by recognisable image (and even figuration, especially
in collage pieces). The avoidance of the discursive in the figural is
analogous to the attitude of sculptor Anish Kapoor who speaks of his
suspicion of objects. A similar suspicion towards language as system is
demonstrated here, along with a fascination with page space (and, by
extension, book-space, in the work of book artists and others).
Some work collected here almost magically holds the two "systems" in a
separate and parallel state.  Drucker's spatiality matches the semantic with
a rare poise and assurance. McCaffery on the other hand talks of presenting
a number of writing systems on one plane.  It is in some of the more hybrid
texts that the system of language and the field of the visible collapse into
one another, beyond the typographical doubleness described and enacted by
Drucker. Each begins to take on aspects of the other. Letter forms or what
might be letter forms, lose their relation to the system (and this doesn't
only happen in the use of alien writing systems, as in Maggie O'Sullivan's
designs). Yet shape and image begin to take on the look of letter shapes,
symbols in an alien script, something that it forced upon the performer of
such texts, for that is what a reader has become (whether or not one rises
to one's feet with Bob Cobbing and begins to sound the texts as a score).
The irruption of thingness in language, as I've hinted above, is the
irruption of material historical occasion, of making, validation, and
performance of the text, that will unsettle linguistic system, and declare
its rooted but excessive presence.
But materiality has not only been used as part of a materialist poetics. A
hundred years ago (and where were the celebrations of this fact?) Mallarmé's
Un Coup de Dés dissolved syntax, opened up the page, varied type size and
style, and margins, partly as a critique of the case of early modern
newspaper design, yet its aim was an ideality of the Book. The paradox is
that, like the contemplation of yantra or icon, an intense perception of
material, significantly disrupted, affords access to a metaphysical realm,
even a spirituality, or (as one contributor argues) to a pre-verbal state of
primeval responsiveness. This paradoxical and, from the point of view of the
poetics I have so far outlined, an opposing view of verbal and visual
practices, can he found in some of the statements contained here. I don't
personally share this view of language and the visual, but it does point to
one of the commonalities of this work: the fact of the made thingness of the
work diminishes the ro1e of selfhood in artistic creation. It also serves as
a reminder of two things: firstly, poetics is a prescriptive, yet
speculative, and suggestive, discourse (unlike the formulations of theory
and criticism) and what it enables is almost as important as what it says;
secondly, that the models of language and the visual are themselves
historically and culturally unstable, and open to continual re-negotiation.
Such work as contained here, whether verbal, visual, hybrid, or whatever it
does or doesn't designate itself, has its place in those re-negotiations.
Its power, in the most general terms, lies in its ability to test and
contest the limits of language, the limits of the visual, and, ultimately,
the limits of the world. Its refusal of boundaries, or its shifting of
these, its exceeding of the boundaries, its excessive drawing into the fixed
areas of literary and art practice of techniques and materials usually
regarded as extraneous, is one of the great challenges that can be made in
this era. As computer technologies conflate the visual and the verbal, an
art which persists and resists at the meeting points of these systems
(whether or not it partakes of the still "new" technologies, and oddly very
little of what is contained here does) is particularly relevant and
exciting. You will discover, as you read the following pages, quite a few
things upon and into them, as the generalities of introduction give way to
specific practices and specific pleasures.

Art for art's sake crosses cultural boundaries.  For the Establishment it is
underwritten by the order of values handed down (along with the trust funds).
For the Avant-garde it is the talisman providing safe rejection of those
values (along with the trust funds).

Everywhere I look I see cliques.  And eminently superficial poetry, written
for friends and mentors.  Phrases parroted from someone's 100 year old idea
of sophistication.

I'm a bad reader & frustrated cleric trying to stir up some noise & get

Art for art's sake cannot be for art's sake. Art for art's sake crosses cultural
boundaries like burb dwellers do. A healthy avant-garde does not seek the new for
the sake of novelty or art, but out of respect for contemporary experience and in
appreciation of those with vision who have gone before.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

hey all, an architect wants to do a directed study w/ me on the poetics of
"human verdigris," that is, the effect of human touch, life, etc on metal
over the course of time, the endpoin tof which would be some kind of
multimedia "docoment," possibly a piece of metal w/ an inscription.  i've
suggested he read lorine niedecker, christian bok's crystallography, clark
coolidge's the crystal text and paul metcalf's work, for tastes of how
poets "materialize" verbally certain materials.  and he's reading, of
course, bachelard.  but does anyone know of texts or writers who are
specifically interested in metals to whom i can refer him?  thanks in
advance, and thanks also for the many responses to my "many queries" of
about a month ago.  bests, md

Anyone have any recommendations on translations of Rilke?  I have a twenty
year old edition of the sonnets and elegies translated by Poulin, which I
have never liked, despite the blurbs on the back by such luminaries as
Lowell, Ignatow, Dickey, and Kunitz. My German is weak, and I don't
respond well to the "yoo hoo" school of Rilke translation.

In a similar vein, I am looking for lucid essay(s) on Rilke, explaining
his significance to modern poetry as a whole.

Peter Riley, _Two Essays_ (Grossteste, 1983) (the first of these is "Note
on Vein Forms," about minerology: "It is a fluid substance, always
bending and drooping and melting, oxydising and dissolving....This
animal-like quality is in conflict with the static qualities of stone or
even wood, which are also integral to human sense")

Peter Riley, _Tracks and Mineshafts_ (Grossteste, 1983) (poems: "The
fuzzily scanned futures of our acts / become a chalky rubble under our
feet, / crumbling downgrade, offer and result / of protection from
climate, horizontal / bone web across the rim of hope, we / sink in it,
down to the ocean floor")

i like stephen mitchell.  he translated "The selected poetry of Rainer Marie
Rilke." I think he only translate mainstream books like that (collections) but
he does a good job and also translates Neruda well.

He is a an excellent translator--he collaborated with Chana Bloch in
translating Yehuda Amichai, and I think he works with a lot of biblical
literature. I did see, however, that he wrote some book about how to use
"the power of Tao Te Ching to achieve success in your financial and personal
life" or something silly like that.

As for Rilke, I have _Duino Elegies_ as translated by David Oswald, and I
like it.

it's a big deal to me now. how wld you feel if someone butchered yr work,
i mean how wld you feel if you really felt that they'd wrecked yr work,
something you spend a lot of time on. or maybe they do butcher your work
and you don't care. i think 10 years after Ron published his anthology he
still cares.

Maria,

Many bookmakers have done metal bindings, some even entirely metal books. I
know Arion Press did a Flatland many years ago with metal covers in metal
case of some sort. Also, Daniel Kelm has done many metal bindings, I think
even inventing one or more styles of binding in metal. Johanna Drucker, I
think, has done some work with metal, too. I'm not the expert on this, but
perhaps through MOMA's artists' book collection, or Printed Matter
Bookstore in Manhattan, a lot could be found out, if you want more
information along these lines. Steve Clay might also be a good resource
about such works.

Someone mentioned Blake in response to this. See Viscomi's _Blake and
the Idea of the Book_ (Princeton 1993) for the authoritative discussion
of the technical processes involved in Blake's relief etching on copper
plates and the relationship of those processes to Blake's poetics. Matt

for those of you who don't know me, skip this message (and i am terribly
sorry to have bothered you).

for those of you who DO know me, you have been wondering where i am.  well,
short version is, about a year ago i lost access to the account that i get
poetics mail on.  my new account at mit was on a different server with a
painfully arcane mail handler.  i did not want to resubscribe till i got
a better mail handler in place.

because i lost access to my old account, i lost everyone's email addresses.

so, S O R R Y to everyone who has been wondering about me.  the longer you
leave an embarrassing and impossible task, the more embarrassing and impossible
it becomes...

excuses out of way, my new email address is mcgrand@mit.edu.  i now have access
to old account, but don't mail me there because am in process of shutting it
down.

how do i get the huge block o' text version, the whole list activity for day
as one email version (reply to mcgrand@mit.edu)?  i will send a real list
type message shortly, but anyway, hello everyone, i missed you all badly.

for those of you who don't know, i am an editor at the Free Cuisinart, an
ezine housed at the Creative Coalition of Artists site at
http://www.on-net.net/~cca

this will change soon -- stay tuned for new address.  we have two upcoming
thematic issues coming up (new zine comes out every two months) -- here is
call for work for them:

-------------------------------------------



The upcoming editions of Free Cuisinart will be "The EP" Free Cuisinart
(extended play), and the Flower issue.

The "EP" Cuis will feature a selection of authors with extended groups
(5-8) of poems.

The Flower issue is not your typical Roses and Carnations and Romance
sort of flower thing.  No, we want _funky_ flowers.  We want the
orange bowl parade as enacted in your exe's Mai Tai.  We want Busch
Gardens worn on the fine sternums of Dolly Parton and Pee Wee Herman.
We want you to surprise us.

The issue will feature poetry, prose, fiction, collage, and artwork
involving flowers in some way.  There will be room for lots of
illustrations, and we are looking not just for poems and fiction, but
most particularly for artwork, and for collage writing -- writing that
melds prose, poetry, standard bureaucratic and/or governmental forms,
found words, street scene quotation, your Aunt May's recipes, excerpts
from your senior prom program... whatever fancy and artisanship dictate.
Just... surprise us.

well, I've been slow in reading my list mail lately so sorry if I'm
coming in at a bad time...

as far as editors go...

1. great way to circumvent all that "voice of the poet" stuff without
even trying

2. and if you want to work with some real chance operations, let it go
to print without looking at it, let somebody else re-lineate everything
for you, I used to think it would be interesting to just let other
people rewrite poems with my name on them (someday we will kill the
author, but it's tough when the "Economist" and the "Guerilla Girls" are
some of the only people on your side, they'll never work together)

I know this may seem a little flippant, but I am serious...as to
whomever had an essay printed after they said "don't print this" that's
very wrong...in the business world you would sue them, but in our world
there's nothing to sue for I guess

All in all, if you find a good editor stick with, Elliot didn't and we
ended up with "Cats." I'm far too silly today to be posting today,
apologies, apologies.

Subject:      thoughts on memory

everyone -- said in earlier message that i missed you, and one of the times
i missed you MOST was when i took on entire cuis issue one month to give
jordie a break.  it was themed around memory, and i did the following
editorial.  i DESPARATELY wanted your thoughtful, insightful commentary
before posting, but in absence of that, here is what went up.  thoughs
whoops thoughts on it anyone?


Editorial for the Memory Issue



The shape we make of the past forms our interpretation of the present
and prophesies the future.

What we remember is what remains in our mind, not what happened. Whether
 a memory is an accurate representation of past events, a distortion, a
partial representation, or a partial distortion, it is only a facet (or
at best a few facets) of the complex, three-dimensional imago, one of
the transformations of the equation of a fractal shape from gigi-second
 to gigi-second, twenty-four hours to twenty-four hours, fifteen minutes
 to fifteen minutes.

Art -- a poem, a short story, a drawing -- can capture one full quick
slice of a multi-dimensioned reality either as it is happening, as it
might happen, as it happened, as it will happen, or as it could have
happened. Art can pick out one facet to follow through the loops and
inside-outs of a stream of time.

Someone told me once that we remember only what we tell. When we write,
 or draw, we are telling, and we are also telling something as if it
were a memory, making a memory out of an imagined memory, putting a
real memory through the filter of imagination. What is both
frightening and comforting somehow is that when reading or writing,
the cenotaph, the representation of a memory of what may have happened,
or never happened, can draw us into another line of memory -- someone
else's memories. I read when I am miserable to exist somewhere
besides in myself. I read when I am elated to merge with other
elations.

Each work is part of memory -- memory passing, memory recaught,
memory in process, writing as a process of memory, writing as an
artifact of memory, the act of memory as an act of forgetting or
of living or of making a death. A writer making memory from everyone
 else's words, a writer making her own words into everyone else's
 memory. The tick, tick, tock, of a mind forgetting, forgetting and
 trying to hold one true thing.

Memory. Cenotaph. Imago. Eidolon. Ideograph. False. Repressed.
Dissociate. Eidetic. Mimetic. Remember. Recollect. Recall.
Reminisce. Regress. Anaphora. Pentimento. Inchoate. Anima.
Disarticulate.

sorry for the name/sake mix-up.

To share with the list also:

here's the thematic reason--rather than just create a collection of
poems in a magazine format--Carolyn Kemp and I decided that a thematic
base allows a certain dialogue to resonate between poems. Especially in
small publications like ours--we wanted to avoid a "collection of stuff
we like"--which we felt some magazines do do. THe theme then (as in
#6--politics--) is an engagement with the notion of themes. Think of
architecture--one needs a site rather than a building or house. The site
then enters into a dialogue with the building rather than the building
being just "placed" on the site. (Thinking of Neutra or Schindler's idea
--the Louis Sullivan buildings or Wrights "organic machine" that a house
must be...) . Anyway--and also-- years later someone mightpull down a
ReMap or other magazine and see what--say--politics or food or nature
editions we did and (hopefully) see a dialogue there between the work,
the magazine, and the reader.

the poems then don't have to be "about" the theme, but rather--about--as
in--he's about the house.

At least that's ReMap's idea.

What do you (all) think?

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

There is an exercise invented perhaps by Bernadette Mayers, which I found
in In the American Tree:  have your friend write poems in "your" voice.
(Of course this would be a deliberate experiment and not a random mangling
by some third party editor)  What charmed me about the experiment was the
idea that one would have all these poet friends who would both know one's
work and be able to pull off a convincing imitation. And of course one
would have to have a distinctive enough style in the first place, so that
the poems would be recognizably yours even if written by someone else.
Could this rise above parody and pastiche of the more obvious sort?

May be.

writers, the inimitable Fanny Howe. Fanny Howe has written twenty books of
fiction and poetry, including The Deep North, The Lives of a Spirit, Poem
from a Single Pallet, The Quietist, Robeson Street, O=B9Clock, and Saving
History. Her most recent is Nod from Sun and Moon Books. She has won two
NEA awards and is a Fellow of the Bunting Institute. She teaches writing
and American literature at UCSD. She is both of the earth and high above
it, her writing touches on the spirit, the body and the complicated social
and political frames both quarrel in. When I get in a jam, I always try to

Just want to say, I disagree with this - what we tell _shapes_ memory by
constituting it within consciousness (Sartre's Psychology of Imag. goes
into this) - but so much memory is untold - so much is within the _body_
itself, not constituted in any way by language or by practice. Drew
Leder's The Absent Body, one of my favorites, comes to mind.

There is so much reliance placed on/within language these days! As if the
mind were email (you're not saying this, I know), as if ascii run rampant
through columnar neural arrays. It's what's overlooked, what's not there,
that's important. What broils through dreams, wavering structures that may
or may not make sense, become sensate. And other than Lacan's saying more
or less it's so, I don't see the unconscious structured like a language,
no matter what distant shores the +like+ is relegated to.

Maria & others,

This was probably taken for granted in earlier remarks about Blake, so forgive
me for stating the obvious, but the fact that Blake often wrote directly on
metal & stone -- that is, on lithographic plates instead of paper -- seems
relevant.  Among other things, how to reconcile the material resistance of the
medium (lithographic texts must of course be written backwards, laboriously)
with Blake's version of automatic writing in which, as a medium himself for
occult forces, he attempts to offer no resistance?

We compared "Herbsttag" (Autumn Day) once on another list--here's Rilke,

     Herbsttag

     Herr: es ist Zeit. der Sommer war sehr groß.
     Leg deinen Schatten auf die Sonnenuhren,
     und suf den Fluren laß die Winde los.

     Befiehl den letzten Früchten voll zu sein;
     gieb ihnen noch zwei südlichere Tage,
     dränge sie zur Vollendung hin und jage
     die letzte Süße in den schweren Wein.

     Wer jetzt kein haus hat, baut sich keines mehr.
     Wer jetzt allein ist, wird es lange bleiben,

     und wird in den Allen hin und her
     unruhig wandern, wenn die Blätter treiben.

     Autumn Day

     Lord: it is time. The huge summer has gone by.
     Now overlap the sundials with your shadows,
     and on the meadows let the wind go free.

     Command the fruits to swell on tree and vine;
     grant them a few more warm transparent days,
     urge them on to fulfillment then, and press
     the final sweetness into the heavy wine.

     Whoever has no house now, will never have one.
     Whoever is alone will stay alone,
     will sit, read, write long letters through the evening,
     and wander on the boulevards, up and down,
     restlessly, while the dry leaves are blowing.

You could have a look at Lawrence Weiner's work. This conceptual
artist says his work is not poetry, but he's no expert. I think he
is, and he's done a range of texts as metal plaques permanently
installed in the outside walls of musems,  set into pavements in
Amsterdam and elsewhere. Jenny Holzer, whose not so good a poet has
however also done metal plaques.

Well, I've always thought that "Stephen Mitchell" was the name an
electronic translation program generated by Harper Collins or Random House
or one of those big publishing houses. It basically works by translating
anything that you feed into it into what is called "New Age American", an
artificial language that is always vaguely familiar if not accurate.

Thanks, Rachel, I needed that opinion & comparison.  And to the others who
recommended or unrecommended translations of Rilke, thanks as well.

Not to single Stephen Mitchell out, but I think the larger problem is that
most translators are content with very little--a sort of flat, generic
translatorese. And then they wax grandiose citing Walter Benjamin. And
they call this "writing a good poem in English." I was looking for more of
a Pound-style translation, one that actually could make this claim in all
seriousness. I guess I want translations that pay attention to
L+A+N+G+U+A+G+E.  Some people accept much less from translations because
they know that they are translations.  I have always refused to do so, and
have gotten a lot of grief (or perhaps given grief to others).

I remember Bly at at a reading years ago.  He said "Here, I've translated
Machado into William Carlos Williams." But he hadn't really, of course.
There was none of Williams' crispness and concern with form in what he had
done.

I've also been unsettled by Stephen Mitchell's translations, enjoyable as =
they
are, because it's quite obvious that none of the tone, diction, voice, etc=
.
(of Rilke's original) remains.  What we're left with may be wonderful poem=
s,
but only "Rilke-inspired."  Anyway, after going over Rachel Loden's offeri=
ng
of M.D. Herter Norton's translation, and the original (although I don't
speak/read German), I found Norton's work to be so much more faithful to
Rilke's sounds, rhythms, and diction (as near as I can tell).  Yet, I'm un=
sure
about various phrases, like the use of "thy" rather than "your" in the fir=
st
stanza's 2nd line, or the convoluted "long will so remain" in the last
stanza's 2nd line.  So, in my ignorance and naivete, I changed Norton's
translation a touch, and wonder if there are are any German-speaking poets=
 who
might comment on whether the changes are more (or less) faithful to the
original, or at least manage to avoid archaicisms that Rilke might not hav=

I still think that Stephen Mitchell (whether man or machine) is a good
translator.  Both of the books I have also contain the Spanish (Neruda) and
German (Rilke) untranslated.  I know enough german and enough poetry to vie
for Mitchell's translation of Rilke... it is poetic, it is a good, fair
translation.

Far too much complaining and snobbery go on on this list.  Be fair.  If you
don't know German well enough to do your own translations, don't judge
another's translations.  If you have "heard" something about a translator,
read him yourself before making judgemental statements.  If Rilke does not
sound enough like, say, Pound, to you, in a translation, well, that is because
Rilke is not Pound.

I think that no matter what translation you choose, you should try to obtain
one with a side-by-side printing of German and English, so that when you are
doing in-depth study of, say, diction, you can find out the connotations of
the original words without depending on a middleman.

And here's a third version (besides Stephen Mitchell's and M.D. Herder
Norton's) of Rilke's poem "Autumn Day," or "Herbsttag":

Autumn Day (tr. C.F. MacIntyre)

Lord, it is time.  The summer was too long.
Lay now thy shadow over the sundials,
and on the meadows let the winds blow strong.

Bid the last fruit to ripen on the vine;
allow them still two friendly southern days
to bring them to perfection and to force
the final sweetness in the heavy wine.

Who has no house now will not build him one.
Who is alone now will be long alone,
will waken, read, and write long letters
and through the barren pathways up and down
restlessly wander when dead leaves are blown.

word-by-word translation is not the same as poetic translation.  if you want a
word-by-word translation you can buy a German dictionary and do it yourself.
if you want a real translation, language to language, a word-by-word
translation such as Norton's isn't what you're looking for.  Remember that
German is not just "other words for English" but actually a separate language
with phrases that, when directly translated, do not convey the intent of the
author.  "Translation" does not mean A=A.  There are incongruencies that will
exist.  Which is why a poetic translation such as Mitchell's conveys the
poetics of the original document.

This may be a bad thing to bring up since none of you seem to like Pinsky, but
his translation of Dante's Inferno is a good example of a poetic translation
that is not a word-for-word translation but is in fact more effective and more
true to the original document.

hmm, for translation into dead lingos Pinsky's Dante compares favorably to
Bly's Rilke though the results are on opposite poles: pinsky's soporific &
Bly emetic.

How do you know?  And what do you mean by "the poetics"?  I'm in complete
understanding that translations are not meant to be literal, "word-by-word"
renditions, as you protested.  However, I prefer having a translation that
transmits as much as possible of the cadence, the diction, the tonality, of
the original.  I don't prefer a translation, at least when attempting to
become acquainted with a poet's work, that exercises great latitude in these
areas.  However, once I'm reasonably acquainted with a poet's work, and have a
good sense of their poetics, their aesthetics, and some of the flavor of the
language and personal diction that they're working in, I love to read more
generously interpretive translations, such as Mitchell's.  I love to read
three, four, five translations of the same poem.  But please...if we're not
going to get books that have a three-fold translation process [Part One: the
original;  Part Two: a "literal" translation (or as close to literal as
possible); and, Part Three: the translator's interpretation of the
poem]----then, I prefer to BEGIN with something that is as close to the
original as possible, taking the fewest liberties.  I don't need to read the
poem in a smooth version of English as an entry-point into the writer's work.
The "smooth" version is desirable at a later point, I think.  Anyway....I
don't think that the various frustrations you're seeing folks express about
translations can be reduced to snobbery.  It's just a very hoary, hairy,
hellish situation we're all dealing with, each in our own way.

no one has mentioned edward snow, who has done the two volumes of the neue
gedichte as well as the recently-published "uncollected poems" (perhaps
other volumes as well -- these off the top of my head).

the puzzling fact about rilke in english -- of the high modernist german
poets he's arguably the most "influential", yet we have no one in english
that has taken on the complete rilke corpus.  (at least for stefan george
there is, tho it's long out of print and the german is not printed en face
with the english; that we lack this for trakl is also lamentable...)
((p.s. to pierre j: when can we expect celan's threadsuns and
lightcompulsion?))

i always try to read poets in multiple translations simultaneously:
individually they are always lacking, together they can begin to
complement the natural defaut des langages (mallarme cum benjamin).

Actually, Bernadette Mayer's book _Moving_ was given to the printer with
the request that he set the lines off the right and left margin ("raggedy,"
was her term) in a random fashion. So that the book that now appears was
given its from by a printer, rather than Mayer itself. Chance operation
indeed...

Mainland poet Susan Schultz and mainland poet I organized this island
writing conference with a few other people mainland writers. It was this
weekend at the University of Hawai'i, Manoa.

On Thursday local poet Kathy Banggo answered some questions and Hawaiian
playwright Alani Apio showed some video clips from his plays. The
audience had lots of questions. Apio said he wanted the Hawaiian nation
and saw revolution as the only way. Some concerns were expressed by
various audience members about bloodshed and revolution. Some audience
members came up to me while I was waiting outside for a ride home and
complained to me after the talk. One said that he felt that as a white
male that his opinion wasn't respected. Another person said they were
from Manhattan and I just didn't understand things. I didn't really
understand what either of these people were talking about.

On Thursday night a reading was held for the new Bamboo Ridge collection
called _Growing Up Local_. I wasn't able to attend. Maybe Bill Luoma,
who did attend, could provide some insight.

Friday night started with mainland novelist Bob Shachochis reading (some
complaining by various authors caused the schedule to get rearranged).
He is a writer for Harpers. He read a piece on Haiti. It ended with an
exotic, full-lipped woman nursing her baby in some sort of place filled
with dead bodies. He used lots of metaphors and long sentences. Bob was
invited by the students who do the Hawaii Review.

Then Kathy Banggo read some poems. She read some in standard English and
then she read some in pidgin. When she read the ones in pidgin the
audience laughed and clapped a lot. Her chapbook is available from Susan
Schultz. It is lots of fun to read.

Then Alani Apio read some poems and a few monologues. He read some poems
about fishing. And one about "fake sleep" which he does so that his
father can touch him. The monologues were really good. One was about a
bunch of haoles coming and killing all the ahi in the character's family
fishing shrine. I thinks his plays are interesting. He has written two
plays in a trilogy. The first is about a character who has sold his land
to a hotel and the hotel has given this character a tour guide job. In
the second, a character comes out of jail and forms a sovereignty
movement to reclaim the sold land. You can order the plays from him. If
you email me I will send you his address.

Then Samoan novelist Sia Figiel read. She read from her novel _Where We
Once Belonged_. She had the giggles while reading the section about the
haole teacher Miss Cunningham. The parts she read from the novel felt
alive. She also read some poems from her new book. Someone,a fellow
white female English teacher, asked me later where the trope of the
white female English teacher originates in postcolonial literature. I
said maybe in AFrican literature but I wasn't sure.

The next day there were three talks. Bob Dylan did his sound check in
the background. He was playing that evening at an outdoor stage next to
the reading.

Figiel read a talk from her new book about winning the commonwealth.

Caribbean-Canadian poet Nourbese Philip read a talk about her writing
and colonialism and language.

Shachochis read from a novel. The novel was a story about a woman who
leaves Kansas to join the peace corp. He said that it was his Miss
Cunningham. He compared the woman in the novel to Figiel. Some people in
the audience didn't like this and complained. They talked about power
differentials.

That evening mainland novelist who has lived in Hawai'i for several
decades Ian McMillian read first. He read a story about a man and his
canoe. The canoe was called the red wind.

Then Nourbese Philip read. She started by reading a quote by a writer
from Hawaii that said that the haoles were all uptight and never had sex
while the Pacific Islanders and the Asians were having a good time all
the time. She talked about s/kinship. Then she read part of a poetic
essay from her new book. She also read some poems she had written
earlier on islands.

Then Samoan-American poet Caroline Sinaviana read. She read a poem that
she dedicated to afro-germans. And a poem about Rudy in Paradise. This
poem reminded me of the quote that Philip used to begin her reading.

Then local novelist Lois Ann Yamanaka read. She read some parts that
were cut by her editor from her forthcoming novel. She said she read for
15 minutes but it felt like only seconds. The audience laughed a lot.
She also looked stunning in a long black skirt and shirt and vibrant
orange lei.

After the readings Apio got up and said he hadn't read McMillians' novel
but that he felt that McMillian shouldn't write about things Hawaiian
b/c it was appropriation. He also complained about McMillian's Hawaiian
which he said wasn't accurate. McMillian said he believed in
imagination. He said that Apio should read the novel b/c the characters
was from New Jersey (although I must admit that the character did seem
to have an Hawaiian name). Philip said that her attitude was that even
if appropriation is wrong, if you can't legislate it you can't do
anything about it. She said that the problem goes away when people from
a certain group start writing. Then the appropriation doesn't matter b/c
no one reads haole on things like Hawaiian canoes anymore. Yamanaka said
to read the novel. She said people often made accusations without
reading the novels. The audience laughed a lot at this line.

A party was held after the reading with free beer and pupus. At the
party the chair of my department, who is local, said to me that next
year we could do a haole invasion conference and I could read. I laughed
at the joke.

Maria,

you should check out the so-called orphic gold plates.  which are gold leaves
with incribed poems, hymns to help the dead person.  they were buried with
dead persons in greece of old.  i forget how scholars date them.  there is an
interesting collection called fragmenta orphica i believe that would contain
them.  edited by one of those german philologists like wilamovitz.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Here's an additional two translations of "Autumn Day," along with the Nort=
on
and Mitchell translations.  What a trip, comparing these...it seems that e=
ach
translator can only meet limited criteria.

For Arndt, recapturing Rilke's rhyme is paramount.

For Bly, telling an accessible story might be the main objective; he's got
such a mixture of strategies, it's hard to determine what's paramount.

For MacIntyre, perhaps a gentle nudging of the original into a gentler Eng=
lish
syntax, and a generally delicate touch where interpretive ego and personal
poetics is concerned, could characterize his implicit ambitions for the
translation he offers.

For Mitchell, a graceful lyric, with full accessibility to a particular ma=
rket
niche, and a certain somberly spiritual cadence, seems primary.

And for Norton, as I've said before, a fairly literal translation that mat=
ches
the rhythm, tone, diction, and syntax of the original, seems most importan=
t.

None of the translators (except for Norton), seem to have been able to
successfully meet multiple objectives (since they must inevitably conflict=
),
and seem instead to have settled on what's most interesting, comfortable,
marketable, or simply reflective of their own personalities.

The additional translations:

October Day (tr. Robert Bly)

Oh Lord, it's time, it's time.  It was a great summer.
Lay your shadow now on the sundials,
and on the open fields let the winds go!

Give the tardy fruits the hint to fill;
give them two more Mediterranean days,
drive them on into their greatness, and press
the final sweetness into the heavy wine.

Whoever has no house by now will not build.
Whoever is alone now will remain alone,
will wait up, read, write long letters,
and walk along sidewalks under large trees,
not going home, as the leaves fall and blow away.

Autumn Day (tr. Walter Arndt)

Lord: it is time.  Great was the summer's feast.
Now lay upon the sun-dials your shadow
And on the meadows have the winds released.

Command the last of fruits to round their shapes;
Grant two more days of south for vines to carry,
To their perfection thrust them on, and harry
The final sweetness into heavy grapes.

Who has not built his house, will not start now.
Who now is by himself will long be so,
Be wakeful, read, write lengthy letters, go
In vague disquiet pacing up and down
Denuded lanes, with leaves adrift below.


 Autumn Day (tr. C.F. MacIntyre)

 Lord, it is time.  The summer was too long.
 Lay now thy shadow over the sundials,
 and on the meadows let the winds blow strong.

 Bid the last fruit to ripen on the vine;
 allow them still two friendly southern days
 to bring them to perfection and to force
 the final sweetness in the heavy wine.

 Who has no house now will not build him one.
 Who is alone now will be long alone,
 will waken, read, and write long letters
 and through the barren pathways up and down
 restlessly wander when dead leaves are blown.

 ---(for my taste, I prefer Norton's work to either MacIntyre's or Mitchel=
l's,
because it seems far closer to Rilke's original, and I'd rather deal with =
some
convolutions in the English, so that I get a taste of the German, than hav=
e
the poem overly-sweetened and watered down and homogenized, etc., etc., et=
c.)



       Herbsttag

       Herr: es ist Zeit. der Sommer war sehr gro=DF.
       Leg deinen Schatten auf die Sonnenuhren,

       Lord: it is time. The huge summer has gone by.
       Now overlap the sundials with your shadows,
       and on the meadows let the wind go free.

       Command the fruits to swell on tree and vine;
       grant them a few more warm transparent days,
       urge them on to fulfillment then, and press
       the final sweetness into the heavy wine.

       Whoever has no house now, will never have one.
       Whoever is alone will stay alone,
       will sit, read, write long letters through the evening,
       and wander on the boulevards, up and down,
       restlessly, while the dry leaves are blowing.

Here's a version by Eric Blarnes:

Lord: it is time.  The summer was so great.
Lay down your shadow on the sundials;
over the meadows let the wind blow.

Goad the late grapes: ripen on the vine.
Grant them two more southern days
to come to perfection, and squeeze
their sweet last into heavy wine.

Whoever has no home now, will not find one
and whoever is alone, will stay alone.
Will stay awake, read, write long letters
and wander the highways up and down -
restless, while the leaves drift.

Pound would probably not be the ideal translator of Rilke.  When I
mentioned Pound, I was thinking of a translator who took language and
poetry seriously.  Mitchell produces readable versions of many poets, not
at all a "bad" translator, but I don't feel like settling for mediocrity.
As I said before, this earns me much grief.

It is precisely those who don't know enough German who have the most*
right to complain, I think.  After all, we are the ones who need the
translation! I agree it's not fair to single out Mitchell. After all, he
is probably better than most.

I don't know what Jessica means by "poetic," "fair," "vie," and

Anyone know if Hard Press is still alive? It's been about a year since the
last issue of _lingo_, and their Web site hasn't been updated in that time,
either. Last I heard --  also about a year ago or longer -- was that they
were in the midst of a fund-raising effort. (I've had a ms. under
consideration there for *two years* because its fate is linked to the
results of that effort.) It would be a shame if we were to lose such a fine
outlet for innovative work. Which reminds me, I'd better get my Sun & Moon
order in the mail...

I'm a little out of date, and so have posted nothing on the Rilke thread.
But I would agree with Rachel's post:  the resonantly-named H.D.
Herter-Norton is rather interesting.  I grew up as a little fledgling
poet, long long ago, reading Herter-Norton, who did much of R's work in a
series of volumes, and C.F. McIntyre, who is also a rather interesting
case.

The best thing of all in my opinion is to use several of these translators
and pick up a bit of the ol' teutonic, and try reading bits of originals.
Rilke is astonshing for how the movement and thematic resonances of each
poem embody themselves in sound.

In my opinion McIntyre is still the best english version of the Duino
Elegies.  There are silly and odd turns of phrase, but that's not
altogether inappropriate to that stunningly new, unprecedented work.

McIntyre believed in trying to capture the rime and meter of the originals
(and also other more fleeting alliterative and in general sonic effects) ,
and he always does so with a kind of ruthless determination, a kind of
brashness, that makes most translators dull by comparison.  He churned out
selected volumes, usually for U. of Cal. Press i think, of a number of
poets..Rilke, Mallarme, Verlaine.  His way with Mallarme is quite
interesting.

Herter-Norton's books were all published by WW Norton, interestingly.
Very different, and in some ways opposite.  Some quite fascinating turns
in the treatment of the Sonnets to Orpheus...which are done like most of
the poems without any attempt to reproduce the endrimes (or sometimes the
meter).

These two translators were everywhere in used bookstores when i was
growing up; no longer true now no doubt, but they will be pretty much
ubiquitous in libraries of every type.

Poulin has taken some hits, and rightly, probably.  But I found it very
useful when Greywolf Press(?) put out his bilingual four volumes of
Rilke's very extensive work in French.  The poems (if bijoux and "small")
are superb and are typical Rilke poems using the resources of French
instead of German. French is a language i have some claim to being able to
read, rather than just muddle thru; rilke as frog is worth checking out
for anyone in the same boat.

Frankly i take it for granted that a poet as entirely himself and grounded
in the physical specificities of his technique, as Rilke, cannot be gotten
at too well in translators..altho' a multiplicity of translators helps.
Personally, i find that german is not that hostile a language to muddle
thru, in order to get at some of the feel of Rilke, Celan, and others.
(Bilingual texts are the best way to start, for all that the english is
never a trot but of course sometimes strays quite far from a literal
rendering...)

Over the years i've glanced at the recent translators, who've been
mentioned, though only cursorily.  I haveta say i'm *not* very impressed,
when they are set next to the ones i grew up with...Tho' i'm sure they
have certain strengths..

Well George Bowering would never say this, for, while always enjoying a
joke he's otherwise unwilling to blow his own horn too loudly,

but his terrific _Kerrisdale Elegies_ is a transmigration of Rilke that
nevertheless manages to carry a lot of the mood of the original into a
completely contemporary & Bowering-esque poetic sequence

                (being Bowering he shifts the acrobats into baseball
players: wonderful)

INBOUND, 9/23/98 (for D.B.)

Shit, I'm fucking late again & the subway reeks
albeit less than last week, at least
the air doesn't feel like it's strangling me

At least all the fruit I bought at the bodega
won't go bad today while I'm at work, at least
I can drink wine or brandy tonight
w/out feeling like I'm being strangled & need

to puke. At least I'm on the lease, & at last
can sit for an hour writing love letters & know
no heat from the concrete below will give
me vertigo, & at last the envelopes I fold each into
will have a return address, where each can be returned.

Thanks, Jonathan. But, I realized, que hay solamente una correcion, last word,
strike "return," add "rebuke." Gotta end on that harsh, Tuetonic-sounding

Yes, in answer to the query about Berrigan's version of the Rilke poem. It
was just on the shelf behind me, so here.


AUTUMN'S DAY
                after Rilke


Lord, it is time. Summer was very great.
Now cast your shadow upon sundials.
Let winds remind meadows it is late.

Mellow now the last fruits on the vine.
Allow them only two more southern days.
Hasten them to fulness, and press
The last heavy sweetness through the wine.

Who has no home can not build now.
Who dwells alone must now remain alone;
Will waken, read, write long letters, and
Will wander restlessly when leaves are blowing.

* MAURICE SCULLY: STEPS

1-874400-15-6   =A36.50 / $11 (estimated)
200 x 120mm paperback   72pp

_Steps_ is book four of Maurice Scully's five-book set with the overall
title of Livelihood. It is a work in three sections in verse and prose
poetry, not a "collection" of discrete items but itself part of a large
structure in which various steps are tested and taken to negotiate a
survival worth having.
Maurice Scully was born in Dublin in 1952. After some years in Italy,
Africa and the west of Ireland, he re-settled with his wife and four
children in Dublin, where he now teaches part-time at Dublin City
University.

1-874400-13-X   =A36.99 / $12 (estimated)
200 x 120mm paperback   160pp

_Futures_ is Ken Edwards' first published novel. It traces the paths take=
n
on her bicycle by the protagonist, Eye, across and out of an unnamed city=

in the wake of an event she can't remember. Her quest is to face her terr=
or
and retrieve the fragments of her life, which lie in the future that neve=
r
quite arrives, until it does.
Ken Edwards founded Reality Street Editions with Wendy Mulford. His poetr=

The issue of translation is very interesting here (as well as elsewhere).
The differention between "word for word" and "author's cadence" suggest
one of those loads of ore that shall never be fully mined out.

Where this discussion pushes me, apart from the obvious what Rilke shall I
read, is toward a comment Ron Silliman posted a while back.  He stated
that he was reading Faulkner straight through for the first time, and that
there was more mind in one of Faulkner's sentences than in...

This thought--mind coursing through, inhering in, cadencing, a given
work--has been pleasently bothering me.  I felt it reading Hass's "Berkley
Ecologue" the other morning and I felt it in "Biotherm" a few hours ago,
but I have no formal way of talking about it.  Norman Malcolm is no use
here, and neither is Ryle. Wittgenstein perhaps?  And is this the cadence
that was mentioned earlier?

I really don't want to sound mystical here, but some thoughts won't leave
until you've forced them out.

 I wonder if those who don't
                   like stepehn mitchells' (or are actively disturbed
  by them)
                  translations of rilke
                                         prefer that guy whose name
  i forget
                 who put the duino elegies in that wcw 3 step
  toodle-loo shuffle mode
                   allegedly more beloved of
                                             proper avant-gardistes
  It seems no one's mentioning
                     Mitchell's DUINO elegies
                                             but the earlier poems
  and no i haven't read robert hunter's
                            translation yet
                                             but i will say that
  mithcell (though I don't know german)
                        made rilke work for me,
                                                made him seem
   less pretentious,
                      less easy-affirmation
                                               more self-doubting, etc

   than the BLY mode he's often
                          associated with
                                               and the duncan mode
   (joris did some interesting

Just to second Chris's praise of Mitchell -- I don't mind the smoothing out
of the crunchier parts, and the fallacy of imitative translation just about
ruins poulin, mcintyre etc for me -- Snow's North Point New Poems and
Uncollected Poems volumes strike me as not too bad --

As far as imitative - seems like the translator is trying to do at least two
things - put up a model that reflects as many aspects of the original as
possible - AND create an equivalent in which the translator's version
gets to shine in its own ambience - the translator's language -
so they're always going to be a resemblance & a difference.  Maybe
this has something to do with the "cadence" thing somebody mentioned -
Honig's Pessoa translations seem to have a Whitman cadence -

but that "difference" is actually a similarity on another level, since
if the translator's ambient language doesn't shine it won't reflect
the dazzle of the original -

Are we just talking about translations of Rilke's sonnets here? I'm sorry
that the Leishman and Spender translation of the Duino Elegies are
longgone and hard to find. I seem to remember Robert Duncan writing
somewhere about how excited he was when they first came out, and how he
and his friends pored over the notes as if they were the Talmud.  To me,
the versions of the Elegies are my favorite in English, but I don't know
German and can't really judge them as translations -- anyone want to
confirm or set straight my perception here?

That's what a "good" translation is -- a convincing imitation. Then, there's
the elusive, mystical element:  what's convincing? But I think this is a
useful way to consider translation. We have to assume a translator's getting
the meaning close enough. So, when you read the new version, are you
convinced?

accurate.)

Cats, mold, & Mitchell.  The latter's Duino Elegies are, at best,
misleading tonally, and at worst, flat-out wrong.  (See the opening of his
8th.)  I really like Gary Miranda's version, which I came across in an
English-only edition from Azul [7804 Sycamore Dr. Falls Church VA 22042;
more info on Amazon].

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Vatican theologians have finished the draft of
a major document in
which the Catholic Church will officially ask forgiveness for its past
errors, possibly including the
Inquisition and its treatment of Poets. The Vatican said Wednesday its
International Theological
Commission would meet next month to work on a document "on the
relationship between the
Church and the errors of the past." The theologians will review a
working draft of a document
ordered by Pope John Paul, who wants the Church of nearly a billion
members to seek forgiveness
for the past as part of celebrations marking the millennium.

What this list needs is a poem about the clitoris:

MY TERN

Implication?  Ocean.
Athwart bastard fingers flying
blood-swan, halcyon, Leda's blessed
fuck.  From the cay of tiny caverns from
cleft-wedged salt-splayed nest, my little
hoodlum hatches honking like a
goose.  This lay is golden, wild
chase commensurate with intricate in-
vulgate song 200 million twelvemonths
long and horny as a beak, at your service
catching oysters, puffin, preening into wind;
dirty bride she struts the isle, raven-
ous cormorant phoenixing on matchstick
thighs burning from the humming-
bird beat of hurtled blood, to spite
Masters and Johnson, those Ordinary
Seamen, their boat docked on a moatful of
last night's frigid bath, who wage
subnaval battle armed with cross-
bow and game-cock.  This is not an albatross.
It's my tern, little bird of secrets sent to rime
above the toilet water perfumed with fish.
Her darkest meat is swelling;
spread her wings, make a wish.

Yes, as to poring over Leishman's notes to the Elegies and Sonnets . . .
some of the most remarkable stuff I ever read, the acme of German
Romanticism (or something) -- easy to see why Duncan would have liked them.
The translations, though, I remember as less impressive.

I come down on the side that wants more from Mitchell's Rilke versions, and
Mitchell's translations in general -- that is, I keep WANTING more, and it
really isn't there. But there is a very nice introductory essay in that
edition by Robert Haas, which I think is another thing Jonathan asked about
in his introductory query.

I'm very interested that Rilke seems to be a . . . constellation . . . in
people's reading (in the sense of Spicer's tree, Olson, the English Dept.,
etc.). Who would have guessed? I pick him up every couple of years or so and
usually wind up getting enraged and literally throwing the book against the
wall. He finally doesn't seem to be writing to me. And yet, and yet . . .

All this autumn talk (and the poem) made me think of "season of mists and
mellow fruitfulness" and "ripeness to the core" -- anyone got the Keats poem
around?

very quickly at my work desk:


What I think - we know - it's about "about" just as you articulated so =
architectually, I fear your drift may be lost or diffused on arch. =
ignoramuses - but shouldn't be.

It's about learning too, in the way poetry informs, or what is revealed =
only through language or the writing of it, what the reader "learns" =
about "politics" and how poetry informs or resonates with that concept. =
The writer, too, may find alternative resonances in their work when =
connected, however loosely, with a thematic idea.

Further, by choosing love, food, nature, etc. - all words worn and =
rendered indistinct by use and misuse, we can refresh them, or come to a =
fresh use ala Stein by placing poems next to them.

sorry for the name/sake mix-up.

To share with the list also:

here's the thematic reason--rather than just create a collection of
poems in a magazine format--Carolyn Kemp and I decided that a thematic
base allows a certain dialogue to resonate between poems. Especially in
small publications like ours--we wanted to avoid a "collection of stuff
we like"--which we felt some magazines do do. THe theme then (as in
#6--politics--) is an engagement with the notion of themes. Think of
architecture--one needs a site rather than a building or house. The site
then enters into a dialogue with the building rather than the building
being just "placed" on the site. (Thinking of Neutra or Schindler's idea
--the Louis Sullivan buildings or Wrights "organic machine" that a house
must be...) . Anyway--and also-- years later someone mightpull down a
ReMap or other magazine and see what--say--politics or food or nature
editions we did and (hopefully) see a dialogue there between the work,
the magazine, and the reader.

the poems then don't have to be "about" the theme, but rather--about--as
in--he's about the house.

At least that's ReMap's idea.

What do you (all) think?

Subject:      the general plight

Here's an article from this week's Science News which I think speaks
volumes about the state of these U. States. (n.b. Science News is a very
useful 16 page weekly for the scientifically curious but semiliterate,
among whom I include myself)

[IMMIGRANTS GO FROM HEALTH TO WORSE

        People from around the world flock to the US expecting to find a better
life. But to scientists' surprise, a growing body of evidence indicates
that increasing familiarity with US culture and socioety renders immigrants
and their children susceptible to many mental and physical ailments, even
if they attain financial success.
        The latest study of this phenomenon, directed by epidemiologist William A.
Vega of the U. of Texas, San Antonio finds much higher rates of depression,
substance abuse, and other mental disorders in US-born Mexican-Americans
compared with both recent and long-standing immigrants. This pattern held
regardless of education or income levels.
        Vega's results, published in  the September _Archives of General
Psychiatry_, appear at the same time as the release of a national report on
declining physical and mental health in children of immigrant families. A
panel convened by the National Research Council and the Institute of
Medicine, both in Washington, DC, reviewed previous studies and concluded
that assimilation into a US lifestyle may undermine the overall health of
immigrant children much more than being poor does.
        In contrast, studies of nonimmigrant US residents usually link poverty to
poor physical and mental health.
        "The material on immigrant health shocked me when we first reviewed it,"
says panel member Arthur M. Kleinman, a psychiatrist and anthropologist at
Harvard Medical School in Boston. "Vega's study is consistent with the
panel's conclusion that immigrants' health deteriorates with assimilation
to US society," declining toward general US norms, says Kleinman. Other
studies have indicated that citizens of many countries, including Mexico,
are healthier overall than US citizens.
        Vega's team interviewed 3,012 adults of Mexican origin, ages 18 to 59,
living in Fresno County, CA. Of that number, 1,810 people identified
themselves as immigrants. Interviews were in English or Spanish.
Interviewers expressed an interest in health issues only and trioed to
minimize any tendency of participants to lie--due to US residency
concerns--about having immigrated.
        Nearly 1/2 of US-born Mexican-Americans had suffered from at least one of
12 psychiatric disorders at some time in their lives, compared with only
1/4 of the immigrants. Common mental conditions in US-born individuals
included major depression, phobias and other anxiety disorders, and
substance abuse and dependence.
        Prevalence rates for mental disorders were lowest for those who had
immigrated with the past 13 years. The higher rates found among immigrants
of 13 or more years still fell considerably below those for the native-born
group.
        Immigrants may constitute a hardy group willing to carve out new lives in
a foreign land. However, immigrants in Vega's study showed mental-disorder
rates similar to those of Mexico City residents.
        A related study of 1,500 public health care users in California, conducted
by psychiatrist Javier I. Escobar of the RWJ Medical School in Piscataway,
NJ, reports lower rates of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder,
as well as better physical health, in Mexican and Central American
immigrants than in US-born Hispanics. Nonetheless, immigrants were poorer
than the US natives, Escobar's team reports in an upcoming _British Journal
of Psychiatry_.
        Physical and mental health advantages for immigrant families vanish by the
third generation of children born in the US, according to the panel report.
Reasons for the initial strength and later decline of immigrants' health
are not clear, says Vega's group.
        Close-knit extended families and cultural injunctions to eat nutritious
foods and avoid drugs and divorce may safeguard the health of recent
immigrants from Mexico, Escobar suggests. Increasing social isolation and
loss of stable religious affiliations may later herald health declines,
Kleinman proposes.]

My one methodological question is that we're not told how mental health
histories were determined and whether the diagnostic standards were
constant. But this seems pretty sound from what we're told here. Note the
tendency not to go beyond the extended family in seeking explanations--the
bias towards defining the primary unit as the individual in the US version
of capitalist society, and the social forces that actualize that
definition, are so extreme that even moving towards defining the family as
unit is fairly recent and almost revolutionary. My guess is that anyone who
grew up in an immigrant community, as I did, would tell you that the
boundary between family and community was porous to the point of being on
occasion almost non-existent, as it is in many other societies. The loss of
that cohesion and its replacement by a system of social rewards and status
based on income rather than utility to the group or even pleasure in the
task might go a long way to answering the mystery. Although hard to devise
an experiomental model to test that hypothesis.
But hey, what am I suggesting? That it takes a village to raise a child? I
must be a commie.

My vote goes for the Leishman-Spender of the Duinos. The chief flaw is that
they are a bit breathy, or breathless, too exclamatory, a tad adolescent.
Leishman, or Spender? I suspect the latter, though I don't know the whole
story of the enterprise--has it been written down anywhere?  Rilke's tone
is quieter and graver, with none of the hysteria in the L-S. But otherwise,
tonally, cadence-wise, and word for word, phrase for phrase, they
accomplished an impressive task. I hadn't realized it is now o-p and in
short supply. Too bad.

Mark-- Most of your questioning below is covered within _Street Lives:
An oral history of homeless Americans_ by Steven Vanderstaay with photos
by Joe Sorrentino its a phenomenal resource on the line between
homelessness, mental stability, ethicity & etcetera.

Be well

there is a book called _the third place_, i forget who by, that addresses
big aspect of this beautifully.  the notion it propounds is this: that in
general, people need a sort of "third space," a space not home, or work,
but completely social.  a few requirements for it to work -- has to have
component of "regulars," and offer, via that "regulars" aspect a sort of
instant camaraderie/mileau within which individual has self-created
definition; 2) needs to be free play without social and class boundaries,
such that big landowner jokes and talks and trades banter as equal with,
for instance, grocer.

author identifies attempts by american architects, in the gaudy Superhoses
whoops! Superhouses, which dot decadently upscale housing developments (of
a sort which i'm SURE WE are all not intimately acquainted!) now intended
as eeyries for overly paid yuppies.  you know the type, with pools and
tennis courts and a gazillion rooms.  these houses attempt to place
the third space in the home, but are doomed to failure because the place
ment of them in family setting cuts off larger community.  author mentions
as successful examples the general store, in front of which people hang
out in small towns in late 1800's to mid 1900's.  or sidewalk cafes in
italy and europe.  also, beer gardens of midwest, as long as they are a
sort of family venue, rather than uproarious places for college students
to vigorously and unpleasantly recycle intoxicants ("you don't own beer,
you only rent it for a while...").

book has been ringing true to me ever since i read it.  now, if only _I_
could find a third space in boston area...

Eliza,

This is an idea that has long intrigued me. Wherever I've lived, I've
tended to adopt a cafe as my 'local', but it usually takes either a few
years of being a regular, or an extraordinarily friendly atmosphere, before
I get to know the staff/proprietors/other regulars. I've tended to prefer
cafes as a writing venue (we did that thread a while ago) over my own
bedroom or living room: even if I'm on my own in the cafe, there's a sense
of being-in-the-world that inevitably shapes my writing.

As far as idenitfying a good contemporary example of this space goes, I'm
similarly ambivalent about Superhouses (or the kind of "urban village"
approach that might be similar). I've just moved into something like this
(maybe I am an "overly paid yuppie", though I sure don't own as much Alessi
kitchenware as our neighbours!), a converted shoe factory in Wellington's
CBD that is within a block of several other apartment blocks by the same
developer. There are no tennis courts or pools as far as I can see, but
many of them aspire to some sort of common area. One has had the building's
roof partly removed to create an open-air "street" on the second floor, one
has a private courtyard on the roof, but ours has two kinds of open area,
one more private than the other. There's a large atrium from the first to
the fourth floors, open only to residents, but beneath this the factory's
been opened up into an archway that now connects two previously dead-end
side streets. Among my neighbours (very few of whom I know well, but I've
only been here a couple of months), there's a range of reactions to this
openness. It does make the place feel less isolated, but they tend to be
less enamored of the drunks and skateboarders.

There was an article recently in an architecture/design mag called Urbis,
discussing these attempts at urban communities, and it pointed out many of
your reservations. Attempts to get a community feeling together were
thwarted by (a) the fact that the (mostly wealthy) inhabitants of these
places often have second homes outside of the city, and are never here at
weekends, and (b) the tendency of people to have their own third spaces,
often in cafes, whose regulars are not determined by neighborhood, but by
old networks of friendship/families/colleagues/ex-flatmates.

I'm more optimistic about our place, because it's close to several other
apartment complexes, the whole meta-complex having several hundred
residents, and there are still a few of the traditional inner-city dwellers
(students and artists living in warehouses) nearby, making the place a bit
more than a ghetto for accountants and architects. There's no real
tradition of inner-city living in New Zealand, but maybe we will see some
sort of post-modern agora taking shape here.


        Cheers,

                Tom Beard.


(P.S. I wonder how this might relate to Benjamin's idea of the Arcade:
not-quite-private, not-quite-public?)

That third space used to be the street itself--porch- or stoop-lined, so
that the boundaries between the familial and communal domains was blurred.
In San Diego a lot of the houses have porches, but no one sits on them, and
the kids don't play on the street (not even the sidewalk). In my old
Irish-Italian-Puerto Rican neighborhood in Brooklyn the stoops became
block-long front-row seats for the adults to observe the children and the
passers-by and to commerce in gossip and negotiate difference. It could
take a half hour to get from the corner to my door with a quart of milk.
And the children were known to everyone, and knew it, from birth thru
adolescence.

The three step line

"free verse"
        make it almost

it might be used for longer
        more discursive poems

Of course, I am not getting the right cadence here.  Wittgenstein said
that understanding a musical phrase is analogous to understanding a

Maybe my perspective on "Stephen Mitchell" is different from everybody else's.

A long list of translations from such widely divergent languages as Koine
Greek, Biblical Hebrew, classical Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and even my
own favorite, Sanskrit, has been attributed to this "Stephen Mitchell" [and
perhaps there are translations from other exotic languages which I have not
seen; I wouldn't be surprised].

Now I won't question Stephen Mitchell's competence in German [BTW, I read
Rilke in this language] and other modern European languages. But I know he
doesn't know Sanskrit, and I have major doubts about the others. That's why
I prefer to attribute these translations to a machine "Stephen Mitchell"
[maybe there's a factory somewhere, I don't know].

So what is this machine designed to do? It has generated a corpus of
spiritual classics for the New Age. Rilke is part of a canon that includes
the Gospels, Genesis, the Book of Job, the I Ching, Zen tales, Rumi,
Sanskrit proverbs on how to accumulate wealth, etc. etc. etc. I think that
this whole "Stephen Mitchell" translation project has levelled these
products of very different cultures into one palatable, highly fashionable,
soup.

Sanskritists for several generations have been wrestling with a problem
which thoughtful translators of all sorts will recognize as familiar. We
have been trying to figure out how best to translate the Vedas. One school
argues that we should try to make them intelligible to modern minds by
adopting what is called 'sympathetic translation' techniques. The result is
the domestication of the Vedas.

What interests me about the Vedas is that they are among the strangest
things I have ever read. One does have to make them strange. They are
strange already. When I translate them I try to keep them that way, horse
sacrifices, bestiality, soma hallucinations and all.

Now the "Stephen Mitchell" project, as far as I can tell, wants to cull
from such books as the Vedas pearls of wisdom that will comfort us in our
moments of spiritual uncertainty, or maybe certainty [I don't know].

You can use the Vedas, the I Ching, the Gospels, etc., any way you want. As
my sons say, it is a free country. But I use these texts as a window into
the minds that produced them. I don't want to be consoled or uplifted by
them.

Not exactly...As i recall it, Witt. had an income (not extravagent) from
some inherited capital.  He also had very little interest in most aspects
of material consumption and lifestyle, that would require this money.  So
he made what amounted more to grants, to help poets get by.  I can't
remember the details re Rilke (tho you are right he certainly at least
considered t helping him) but i know he made a grant of this kind to
Trakl.

Witt's belief that financially supporting poets is a top priority, is
needless to say the single most important thing about him.  Well-off
individuals in our time and place should be reminded of his example, and
urged to emulate it.

Very much agree with db's take. When Jerry Rothenberg & I were putting
together the first volume of MILLENNIUM we looked at most if not all extant
translations of Rilke. As far as the elegies are concerned, the
Leishman/Spender still sounded the best, so we decided to use their
translation of the First Duino Elegy. As we were interested in new
translations whenever possible or necessary we asked Robert Kelly to
translate the Eighth Duino Elegy  =8B & that turned out to be a lovely
working.
    I redid a few of the shorter poems (_Death_ & _Tombs of the Heterae_)
not because we couldn't have used some other ones, but because I couldn't
resist the pleasure of it! For some odder Rilke =8B a strange text not
published until the 70s because the estate didn't want to release it =8B see
my translation of _Testament_ in SULFUR # 30 (spring '92).
    As far as Stephen Mitchell is concerned, George Thompson's recent post
hits the nail on the head. Any translation that makes an original (George
mentions the Vedas) more "approachable," "understanbdable" i.e., an easier
read, than the original, is off the mark. This point I have argued in
various places when writing on Celan translations.

The fund Wittgenstein established for "needy artists" just before the outbreak
of WW1 was equivalent to something like $100,000. 00 in today's currency.  It
was disbursed to visual artists (e.g. Kokoshka), philosophers, etc. as well as
poets -- the 3 largest beneficiaries however were Rilke, Trakl, and Carl
Dallago. W didn't select the beneficiaries himself, & as his biographer Ray
Monk tells it, disliked Rilke's later work, & had never heard of Trakl before
the disbursment was made -- when W did read him he said that, although he
couldn't understand Trakl's poetry at all, he liked its "tone."  Although W
was himself somewhat cool to avant-garde work -- if not hostile -- it's
curious, but not surprising, that he should be the favorite philosopher of the
av-g.  Marjorie Perloff discusses this brilliantly in _W's Ladder_ -- an
extraordinary book.

On a completely different note, it's always struck me as truly strange that W
& Hitler were contemporaries at the same Realschule in Linz -- they were
exactly the same age, although W was 2 grades behind H at the  school --  In
_Mein Kampf_ -- if I remember the story correctly -- H. says that there was a
wealthy Jewish student at the school -- he doesn't give a name -- to whom all
his hatred of the Jews can be traced -- I've heard it speculated that W. was
that student.

   Hey, just picked up the new St. Mark's PP Newsletter (#171)
   and notice the editorial change (Coultas and Sikelianos) and
   its colorado/nature slant (john wright on community gardens
   and collom...) Notice also that poetry is being published in it
   again, and notice that it is now no longer strictly publishing
   "SWEETHEART REVIEWS" and is perhaps going to allow for the kind
   of controversy and dialogue it hasn't seen since the jordan davis
   regime. Well, we'll see---though I disagree with the angle of
   the particular negative review included in it I applaud the editors
   for their willingness to raise such issues....

   Also of note in St Mark's newsletter: two reviews that mention the
   first line of Ashbery's THREE POEMS (one on Ashbery by someone
   I've never heard of--Daniel Kane) and another one on Heather Ramsdell
   by Mark Wallace. Kane also shows that Ashbery is responding to Padgett
   in one of his poems (an interesting review that may challenge the
   dichotomy Debrot proposed last month), and reviews of Notley's new
   book as well as Charles North's book of essays--which I am hoping to
   get when my adjunct checks start rolling in like little toothpick boats

   Also, an ad for chapbooks from some Talisman subsidiary called
   JENSEN/DANIELS. It almost sounds like it should have some
   slogan like "Books for the discriminating palate" beneath it,
   but it doesn't. (and a review of Edwin Torres' CD by Josie McKee)

   RAIN TAXI--is also great, kicking off with some controversial
   letters to the editor (Marilyn Lynds pointing out that Ashbery's
   "The Dong With The Luminous Nose" is NOT an erection but based
   on a poem by a man named lear....
   And William Heyen defending his book against a reviewer
   Also includes a great interview by Brian Evenson with John Yau,
   a non-octupus shaped cartoon by my roommate (ah nepotism!)--
   ANOTHER review of ramsdell, and NOTLEY----
   a great piece on Frank Stanford's unpublished epic (which CD Wright
   doesn't seem to like) "The Battlefield Where The Moon Says I Love You"

   Other highlights: A review on Bernstein's CLOSE LISTENING that
   does a fairly good job of summing up much of the book (though it
   ignores Perelman's contribution), and finally
   a review of a biography of the late great BILLY TIPTON!!!!!!!!!
   Do people here know about Billy Tipton????????
   I always wondered how she fooled her wives into believing she
   was a male, and here the mystery is solved (but still hard to
   believe).......
   Well, a lot more I skipped of course. But it's nice to see an
   eclectic range of writers here, and sure beats reading nothing
   but the newspapers on the subway.........

VILAMOURA, Portugal (Reuters) - The Academy of American Poets issued
what it said was a virtual ultimatum Thursday to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to stop the violence in Kosovo or face poetic
retribution. So far, only Germany has went on record agreeing with the
poets stance by agreeing a formal deadline should be set, their defense
ministers agreed Milosevic must quickly obey the Poets' order to halt
the crackdown on ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province or take the
consequences. U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told journalists that
"I am happy to see that poets still have a miniscule amount of
revolutionary power."

Thanks to George Thompson and Pierre Joris for glimpses under the hood
of the Mitchell threshing-machine and to Ron Silliman for signing up on
the "actively disturbed" (quoth Chris Stroffolino) side of things.  Am
voting for the Bill Gates (via Tom Beard) version of "Herbsttag"--I
mean, "den shrewd weenie"!  Who can compete with that?

I do tend to wax apoplectic on this subject as the unfortunate recipient
of any number of Mitchell texts given as gifts by well-meaning friends
and family members with the shining hope that they are thereby giving me
"poetry."  And this is the real shame, that these Velveeta versions (or
maybe Stepford texts) are substituted for the real strange thing and are
out there contributing to the general anemia.

So I remain vastly puzzled as to how Mitchell's versions can be "less
easy-affirmation, more self-doubting, etc."

Here's a line chosen at random from Job, first King James and then
Mitchell:

  Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and
answer thou me.

  Stand up now like a man;
        I will question you: please, instruct me.

Feh!  Is this what was called "the smoothing out of the crunchier
parts"?  How do we not mind this?

Earnestly desiring instruction,

Jesus said appearing nightly at Canadian doughnut shop


            BRAS D'OR, Nova Scotia (Reuters) - Jesus may be trying to
send a message to night owls on their midnight doughnut binges.
Or perhaps He just craves a cup of coffee.
            Either way, hundreds of people are flocking to the Tim
Horton's doughnut shop in the small Cape Breton Island town of
Bras D'Or on Canada's Atlantic coast to see a Christ-like image
that has inexplicably appeared on an outside wall.
            The apparition first showed up  Monday and was said to be
clearly visible to staff at a restaurant across the road under
the shop's floodlights.
            ``They removed the light yesterday ... but now apparently
you can see it towards the side of the building, as if the image
has moved,'' said a waitress at the nearby Lick-a-Chick
restaurant.
            ``People are coming from far and wide to see it.''
            The waitress, who did not want to be identified, said there
is little to see in the daylight -- the image is clearest at
night -- but there were traffic jams around the doughnut shop
Thursday morning as the curious and credulous flocked to the
site.
            ``Apparently, it's really, really busy up there already
today. I guess the traffic is crazy and there's cars parked all
around,'' said Diane Slopek, a spokeswoman for the Tim Horton's
chain, which is owned by Wendy's International Inc .
            ``We're just puzzled by the whole situation.''

Lick-a-Chick? That waitress must be Mary Magdalene.

Just a short request for information regarding Trakl translations.

Who and where can I find decent translations of Trakl?  I am studying
Heidegger and Trakl next semester and multiple suggestions would be
helpful.

Thanks!

A ray of hope for Salman Rushdie, though it doesn't mean he's out of danger
-- this from today's TIMES:

By BARBARA CROSSETTE

UNITED NATIONS -- On Thursday, the Iranian foreign minister publicly
divorced his government from the death threat imposed on British author
Salman Rushdie in 1989 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and Britain responde=
d
by restoring full diplomatic relations.
"The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention, nor is it
going to take any action whatsoever to threaten the life of the author of
'The Satanic Verses' or anybody associated with his work, nor will it
encourage or assist anybody to do so," the Iranian foreign minister, Kamal
Kharrazi, said in a statement that he read to reporters Thursday.
Kharrazi's remarks followed comments made in New York on Tuesday by Iran's
president, Mohammad Khatami, who told reporters that the Rushdie affair was
"completely finished."
Standing next to Kharrazi, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said he was
"delighted" to hear Iran's position clarified and to know that the reward
offered to anyone willing to kill Rushdie had been officially renounced.
Although an Iranian foundation continues to offer a $2.5 million bounty for
the death of the year-old Indian-born British author, whose novel Kharrazi
said still offended Iranians, the foreign minister said his government
"dissociates itself from any reward that has been offered in this regard an=
d
does not support it."
A somewhat stunned Rushdie, interviewed by telephone in London, said
Thursday night, "It's over."
"Until I went into the meeting with the British government, I wasn't sure,"
he said. "But they have told me emphatically that this is it. It's a
breakthrough, and it's over. It's done. There is no longer any threat from
the Iranian regime. The fatwa will be left to wither on the vine."
In addition to meeting with officials from the British Foreign Office,
Rushdie spoke by telephone with Cook twice Thursday, and said he was
convinced by the government's assurances. "I am given unequivocal and
emphatic and definite information from the British government that it's
true," he said.
Rushdie, who over the years often seemed on the verge of being released fro=
m
his death sentence, only to have the Iranian government reiterate its
commitment to the fatwa, or religious edict, said he wasn't sure how to
handle the thought of freedom, and had not yet begun making arrangements,
for instance, to travel in public without a team of Special Branch agents
guarding him. It was not clear what his new security, if any, might entail.=

"When you're so used to getting hard news -- and by that I mean bad news --
then news like this is almost unbelievable," he said. "It's like being told
the cancer is gone. Well, the cancer's gone."
He added, "This has been an enduring and collective effort, and I want to
thank all those people who helped, many of whom are in the United States,
including the government of the United States."
Rushdie's book, which was first banned in India, in the fall of 1988, and
prompted riots in Pakistan in early 1989 just before coming under Khomeini'=
s
edict, shocked Muslims in many countries, who deemed it blasphemous.
The book, written in Rushdie's most surreal style, includes a dream sequenc=
e
with prostitutes impersonating the wives of Mohammed to improve their
business. It also refers to Mohammed as Mahound, a demon in Christian
morality plays. Rushdie, who was born a Muslim, was seen as a traitor to hi=
s
faith.
After Khomeini called for Rushdie's death, the author was forced to seek
haven in a series of safe houses in London and was guarded around the clock=
.

In recent years, Rushdie was able to travel abroad from time to time, but
always under tight security. He has made several visits to New York, to
promote books he has written since "The Satanic Verses" and to appear on
television interviews and in small public gatherings.
Rushdie, the co-editor most recently of an anthology of South Asian writing
titled "Mirrorworks," has never been able to return to his birthplace,
Bombay, India, however, and has not ventured into Islamic countries, where
emotions still run high.
At an impromptu news conference Thursday after meeting Kharrazi, Cook said,
"Her Majesty's government recognized the fundamental role of Islam in
Iranian life and understood and regretted the offense the book 'The Satanic
Verses' has caused to Muslims in Iran and elsewhere in the world."
Cook said the understanding reached Thursday with Kharrazi would improve
ties with the European Union as well as Britain. The British, who had been
represented in Tehran by a charge d'affaires, said Thursday that they would
raise the level of representation to ambassador.
"These assurances should make possible a much more constructive relationshi=
p
between the United Kingdom and I believe the European Union, with Iran, and
the opening of a new chapter in our relations," Cook said.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who received something of a rebuff
from the Iranians this week, was less enthusiastic. The United States has
not had diplomatic relations with Iran since the seizure of the U.S. Embass=
y
and the taking of American hostages in 1979 during the revolution that
brought Khomeini to power. Khomeini died in June 1989, a few months after
the edict was issued.
"The question is, how will it be implemented," Albright said of Iran's
pledge to distance itself from the bounty.

rompted riots in Pakistan in early 1989 just before coming under Khomeini's =
edict, shocked Muslims in many countries, who deemed it blasphemous. <BR>
The book, written in Rushdie's most surreal style, includes a dream sequenc=
e with prostitutes impersonating the wives of Mohammed to improve their busi=
ness. It also refers to Mohammed as Mahound, a demon in Christian morality p=
lays. Rushdie, who was born a Muslim, was seen as a traitor to his faith. <B=
R>
After Khomeini called for Rushdie's death, the author was forced to seek ha=
ven in a series of safe houses in London and was guarded around the clock. <=
BR>
In recent years, Rushdie was able to travel abroad from time to time, but a=
lways under tight security. He has made several visits to New York, to promo=
te books he has written since &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; and to appear o=
n television interviews and in small public gatherings. <BR>
Rushdie, the co-editor most recently of an anthology of South Asian writing=
 titled &quot;Mirrorworks,&quot; has never been able to return to his birthp=
lace, Bombay, India, however, and has not ventured into Islamic countries, w=
here emotions still run high. <BR>
At an impromptu news conference Thursday after meeting Kharrazi, Cook said,=
 &quot;Her Majesty's government recognized the fundamental role of Islam in =
Iranian life and understood and regretted the offense the book 'The Satanic =
Verses' has caused to Muslims in Iran and elsewhere in the world.&quot; <BR>
Cook said the understanding reached Thursday with Kharrazi would improve ti=
es with the European Union as well as Britain. The British, who had been rep=
resented in Tehran by a charge d'affaires, said Thursday that they would rai=
se the level of representation to ambassador. <BR>
&quot;These assurances should make possible a much more constructive relati=
onship between the United Kingdom and I believe the European Union, with Ira=
n, and the opening of a new chapter in our relations,&quot; Cook said. <BR>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who received something of a rebuff f=
rom the Iranians this week, was less enthusiastic. The United States has not=
 had diplomatic relations with Iran since the seizure of the U.S. Embassy an=
d the taking of American hostages in 1979 during the revolution that brought=
 Khomeini to power. Khomeini died in June 1989, a few months after the edict=
 was issued. <BR>
&quot;The question is, how will it be implemented,&quot; Albright said of I=
ran's pledge to distance itself from the bounty. <BR>

Dear list members:

I don't believe that Mitchell's translation is as artless as some of you
seem to imply.  When one compares his version of the final stanza of
"Herbsttag," for example, with all the others that have been quoted,
Mitchell's seems to me to be obviously superior.  Like MacIntyre, he tries
to approximate Rilke's rhyme scheme; but Mitchell is more faithful to Rilke
in that he avoids the temptation of a final rhyming couplet.  Mitchell's
near-rhymes (somewhat like Pinsky's in his _Inferno_ translation) strike me
as a graceful reconciliation with the original: they permit a plain style
(like Rilke's, in this poem) that nonetheless retains a sonic pattern.  And
a plain style seems far preferable to the supposedly more "accurate"
version of Herter Norton.  "Build him one no more"?  "Long will so remain"?
Aren't _these_ constructions, vaguely archaic and portentous, much closer
to the language of conventional spirituality?  The "real strange thing"
about Rilke seems to me less a matter of his diction (Augenaepfel aside)
than of how his mind and imagination work.  Hass's essay in the Mitchell
edition gets at this strangeness.

So what exactly is the complaint against Mitchell?  That his books are
popular?  That he is interested in poetry not as a cultural artifact, but
as a religious discourse?  These would seem to be within his rights as an
author.

Andrew Rathmann,
Chicago

Rilke:

Wer jetzt kein haus hat, baut sich keines mehr.
Wer jetzt allein ist, wird es lange bleiben,
wird wachen, lesen, lange Briefe schreiben
und wird in den Allen hin und her
unruhig wandern, wenn die Bl=E4tter treiben.

Mitchell:

Whoever has no house now, will never have one.
Whoever is alone will stay alone,
will sit, read, write long letters through the evening,
and wander on the boulevards, up and down,
restlessly, while the dry leaves are blowing.

Herter Norton:

Who has no house now, will build him one no more.
Who is alone now, long will so remain,
will wake, read, write long letters
and will in the avenues to and fro
restlessly wander, when the leaves are blowing.

MacIntyre:

Who has no house now will not build him one.
Who is alone now will be long alone,
will waken, read, and write long letters
and through the barren pathways up and down
restlessly wander when dead leaves are blown.

        Well, since the red Sox clinched the wild card berth today, there
are
        cheers in Fenway.

        I was wondering if I dared broach the subject of this last weekend
of the season on this list, and I thank George for letting it in through the
back dugout, so to speak. Poetics fans in New York, Chicago and San
Francisco (arguably the three most important cities in North American
poetry) are urged to comment -- poetically, of course -- on the respective
merits of their teams. Chicago is my kind of town, even though I did
literally leave my heart in San Francisco. (I always thought the third space
WAS the baseball diamond . . . )

Thanks for the tip. A very good piece, a good bit of which is scarcely
translatable, dependent as it is on puns and homynyms peculiar to French.=20

Wonderful to comtemplate what kind of intellectual forum a popular
newspaper can be in a country that insists on educating its citizens. On
the other hand the French do PhyEd very badly (but somehow, dspite their
pollution, alcohol and nicotine, manage to outlive us).

1). _Epoch_ magazine at Cornell University published no poetry in its last
issue.

2). I have looked at _Epoch_'s slushpile and can report the mag gets few
poetry submissions.

3). This must change.  This is therefore a call for help.

4). You're thinking, "Epoch is a venue I'm not interested in."

5). Nonsense. The magazine has been known to publish genuinely non-gooey
ink, even avant-garde things.

5). What I'm saying is there is, like, a poetry paucity at this magazine.

6). This is a bad thing.

Thanks, David, for the Reuters wire. I would like to point out that
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen has published two books of poetry
with Morrow. Cohen, a New Georgian poet just like his pals at the The
Academy of American Poets, in his quote captures the "virtual" (read
delusional) spirit of the Academy's ultimatum.
Meanwhile, I've been reading Diana Johnstone's background piece on
Yugoslavia in the new Covert Action Quarterly. Its basicly a rehash but
she makes some interesting observations about liberal NGOs in the
region. I guess the Academy is a kind of faux NGO because even their
ultimatum is not likely to garner any IMF, corporate or state money.
The Reuters wire points out that only Germany so far has supported the
Academy's ultimatum. Perhaps, that's because Germany leapt in
prematurely to recognize Croat and Slovenian independence and to declare
the Serbs the new Nazi's as though it were a curse that could be pass on
to another people. In point of fact it was the Croat Ustashe that
aligned with the Nazis during the Second World war and the Nazis,
themselves, were said to be horrified by the Croats brutality against
the Serbs, Gypsies and others.
Even the German foreign minister at the time objected to the move to
support Croat and Slovenian independence. But it was seen as tantamount
to the economic annexation of two of the more potentially wealthy
regions in the former Yugoslavia. Such secession was illegal under
Yugoslav and international law but the Germans legitimized the move,
held off international opinion against it and helped precipitate the
atrocities commited on all sides.
Cohen in a poem called Deng's Revolution to his great hero, the late
Chinese Premier Deng Shiao Ping, writes:

Let your vision
for propsperity
whisper to the world
without violence and low,
like the wind
in the wheat fields.

Of course, Deng said "To grow rich is glorious" so he's alright in
Cohen's book. What's a little slaughter when the blood runs green.
Besdies against the tide of all history, Cohen, 'wished' the transition
proceed 'without violence'. That's certainly a trait of the New
Georgians--delusional wishing.No wonder in between bombing
pharmaceutical plants, Cohen chooses to write poems in the style of the
New Georgians. What is the Academy going to do; write ten poems for
every Croat Milosevic slaughters. Such levity in the face of such horror
only serves to demonstrate the impotence of the Academy as emphasized by
their fellow Neo-Georgian, Bill Cohen.---Carlo Parcelli

Hokusai's Visit to Kyoto, 1828 (Bunsei 11)


Hokusai kicks higher into the air than safety would allow!
Hokusai heartily moves upward and downward on the same spot and fast!
Hokusai runs aimlessly around the MOO, Coyote on the loose!
I don't understand that.
Hokusai cries, half in sadness and mourning, half in pure exhaustion.
Hokusai laughs infectiously and everyone desires to join in!
I don't understand that.
Hokusai kisses everyone, remembering safe sex, and the kindness of
 strangers!
Hokusai walks around Kyoto looking at everyone through his eyes.
Kyoto
an intense clearing, city-basin, distant humans, everywhere visible...
You see snow, Luminous Sign, and the City of Wind here.
Player name      Connected    Idle time    Location
-----------      ---------    ---------    --------
Hokusai (#127)   a minute     0 seconds    Kyoto

Total: 1 player, who has been active recently.
I don't understand that.
Flap flap flap flap flap flap! while Hokusai flies away!

I'll second this.  Barr is a good editor and Epoch is a good magazine open
to interesting work (heck, they published me twice).

As a former _Epoch_ editor-type (back in CS Giscombe's days), I can vouch
for the magazine's "quality."  And knowing Burl Barr, I can vouch for his
seriousness & goodness.  But let's face it--the magazine has taken a
strong turn towards the fiction side of things in the last few years; are
you intimating, Gabriel, that one wouldn't be wasting one's postage,
paper, and printer cartridge to send disjunctive / alyrical /
"experimental" work _Epoch_'s way?  (If so, more power to yez.)

Thanks for picking up on that. The books you refer to are _Of sons and
Seasons_ and _A Baker's Nickel_ which are rated 372,252 and 638,074 at
amazon (just so Ron knows). But the best is the one was written with ex
pres canidate, this is a review from it:

The Double Man : A Novel
William S. Cohen, Gary Hart

Amazon.com Sales Rank: 492,724

Complete waste of time. Totally unfulfilling.
Absolutely no sense of completion. My only guess is that everything will
be resolved
in a future book (though I wouldn't read it).

The book was written well but that only leads to the expectation that
there will be
some substance to the plot. The reader never finds out: 1. Who the
double man is (if
there is one). 2. What really happens to Elaine. 3. Who her father
really is, etc. The
protagonist (investigator) never finds out anything himself but is told
everything by
secret "deep-throat" types. The ending is wrapped up in a few pages by
someone who seems to be in a hurry to get back to the Senate floor for
roll-call.

In exchange for learning about some inside workings of the senate, we
are forced to
except a far fetched plot that magically ties up the JFK asassination,
drug smuggling,
the Mafia, and secret KGB plots.

I got this paperback at a book sale and I don't think it was worth the
50 cents that it
cost. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of
this title.

Be well

How good... no... what a relief to see someone point out that there is
another point of view... was watching tv a while back, a thing I rarely do
so I don't know how frequent it is, and someone talking about Bosnia began
to criticise the Croat side relative to the Serbs; and the chair immediately
cut in and said "Well, we don't want to go into the details"

I'm still hoping to hear a NATO warning for China to get out of Tibet. Of
course, the Chinese might shoot back.

What's this got to do with poetry? Well, I'd rather hear more critical news
and fewer war poems by people who have not been to the countries involved

Ithaca House (under John Latta at that point) did my book in 1985, NEW
FACES OF 1952, for which I am grateful.

And judging from the excellent writers we publish in New American Writing
and the numerous excellent writers we have to turn away (doing an
annual mag), there are plenty of people out there for Epoch.

Heck no, Mark -- not intimating that at all at all.  Only that you're
right to think that the magazine favors the lyrical -- BUT it doesn't
exclusively favor it.  Burl is totally open to non-lyrical work, to
unrecognizable work: he's a good patient solid thoughtful reader.  He
knows that just as one writer can be capable of the traditional lyric as
well as new lyrical or alyrical work, so also can one typical Epoch
reader want to read both, either, or something completely different.

Yes, Epoch just turned in a big-way toward fiction: but this is a turn
less of editorial policy, I think, than of reputation's vicissitudes
(i.e., Epoch just won the O'Henry Awards and was voted best mag of the
year, beating out even The New Yorker -- or something like this), and I'm
reporting to you that because of this new rep, we're getting fewer poetry
submissions, and I'm basically GIVING EVERYONE A TIP: opportunities,
opportunities, opportunities...

Please send.

The work itself.

                                                        So,
It seems to me
               While the 3-step line _was_ an attempt
                                                     To regularize
"Free verse"
            (Used,
                  As Jonathan points out
To great effect in "Asphodel"),
                               It's effect,
                                         Like the short line generally

Is also to materialize the poetic line,
             Working
                     Against the discursive flow. Thus, Chris's
Association of this w/
                      The "avant-garde"
                                        Is not all wrong.

Try this as an experiment:  "sew" a triadic line poem back together and
scan.  I did this some time ago, and discovered that many lines turned out
to be iambic pentameter.  Apologies, Bill.

And many more that didn't. This rather misses the point. WCW was not
obsessed with avoiding the iamb at all costs, he was inventing a different
kind of metrics and a different way of conceiving same. The lineation is
never for the sake of a predesigned formula. Try reading each part of the
triad as a metric unit. So, in "The Ivy Crown" (I opened at random) there
are only two triads that could be scanned as iambic. The first reads
but being mortal
            can defy our fate.
                        We may

This is not iambic hexameter. This is three variable feet. The swing is
completely different

For those who believe that Mitchell is really a machine, here's a real
machine translation (courtesy of
"http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?") of Herbsttag:

-------------
Autumn day

Gentleman: it is time of the summers was very large. Put your shadows on
the sonnenuhren, and suf the corridors release the hoist.

Instruct the last fruits to be full; gieb for them still two more southern
days, urge it to the completion and hunt the last sweet one into the heavy
wine.

Who has now no house, no more builds itself. **time-out** who now alone be,
will it for a long time remain, will be awake, read, long letter write and
will in the all back and forth jerky move, if the page drive.
----------

I love the "Gentleman:" bit, but where the hell did that "**time-out**"
come from?

I think the "real strange thing" that those constructions present, for me
at least, is the impression of reading a foreign language. We have the
luxury with English of being able to translate into a very flexible syntax,
so that it's possible to produce something closer to the original word
order while still being parseable. "Long will so remain" _sounds_ like the
kind of contorted syntax that Anglophones recognise as being distinctly
German.

Perhaps the worst way to translate a poem (as a poem) is to make it sound
like comfortable, conversational English.

To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Amnesty International is collecting signatures for a pledge to
support this very important United Nations declaration. Amnesty already has
3 million signatures (real and virtual) world wide, and wants 8 million
(which would be 1% of the world's population). The UN Secretary General has
already agreed to be present either in person or live by satellite, if he
has to be in New York, to receive the pledge as a  tangible statement of
the people of the world's commitment to an  international agenda of human
rights

The most simple way to add your name to the pledge is to:

       Send an e-mail to:   <udhr50th@amnesty.org.au>

  Put YOUR NAME in the SUBJECT and the following text in the message:
        "I support the rights and freedoms in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights for all people, everywhere."

Please forward this message to as many people as you can.

Tom, the mysterious "time-out" is an amazing serendipitous find; I used
the same webpage to translate "Me and Bobby McGee" into and out of several
languages in a row, and after one of the Romance languages, "bobby" lost
its proper-noun status and became "police officer McGee." Kind of a twist
in the plot.

Not much to add to this discussion, except to note that the iamb occurs
quite naturally in English language speech--that's _why_ it was so popular
in the first place.  Listen, and you'll hear iambs in the evening news.
Not pentameter, of course, but certainly rhythmic.  Finding that a triadic
line contains iambics is not much more surprising.

I too love the Babelfish translation programs....in fact I have been using
them to make poems lately.....that is I translate and retranslate sentences,
fragments, paragraphs....then edit and retranslate.

My current favorite is how confusing the program finds pronouns.

I think that the program bases the gender of the pronoun based on the gender
of the noun following it. so she plays her piano becomes it games it plan.

Anyway, it is my new favorite way to undermine my "voice"

Hi Peter,

Thanks for re-sending those books--I've already managed to give about 30 of
them away!

Let me please reiterate my gratitude--it's been so nice to have a little
book to give to people. Strange, though, to give it to my dad (I don't dare
give one to my mother).

In any case, I have this reading coming up on October 12th and want to be
sure to have enough books there for anyone who may want one. Maybe could
you send me 10 or so to sell? I could sell them at my reading and also put
some on consignment at the good bookstore here (St. Mark's), and also sell
some at Jordan Davis's reading series, where he lets people sell books etc.
In other words, maybe send me 15 on consignment? I'll sell them and give
you the money as it comes in? I, of course, will prepare covers here, so
you'd have to send just books sans dust-jackets. Would this be okay?

Hope the rest of the series is going well. I just finally really got a real
job copyediting Avon catalogs--strange but pays well. Am for sure planning
on purchasing entire series in a month or so. Thanks for doing this--will
send Explosive #6 and Juliana's chapbook soon.

Best,
Katy

Years ago, when I was living in Ithaca, I sent a few poems in to Epoch. I
sent them in the mail on a thursday and the rejection arrived in the mail
on saturday.  I don't think they could have been in Goldwyn Smith Hall for
more than twenty minutes.  I imagined a grad student in creative writing
taking the poems out of the envelope, passing a jaded eye over them, and
stuffing them into my SASE.  Nothing like swift and painless rejection!

I'll try again, though.

In reading the digest form of Poetics, I realized
that I left out the ordering address for A.BACUS.

It is:
Potes & Poets Press Inc
181 Edgemont Avenue

Please note that the chapbooks should be ordered
through Small Press Distribution.  An expanded
announcement regarding those will be on the list
in a few days. Keep eyes peeled.

I will be reading new manuscripts for the chapbooks
in January.  Send then.

Does your "metric unit" mean more than something that takes up a
different measured space on the page?

What's the variation, then, that makes this line "variable" or makes it
swing completely differently from whatever swing iambic pentameter has
(and i.p. swings in more ways than one)?

Williams' first two part-lines are simply i.p. with a caesura
conventionally halfway through the line, where W first breaks the line:
the only variation here is to mark the caesura with indentation.

The line sounds then like much conventional metric verse:  the foot
boundaries don't coincide with word boundaries in the first half, then
do coincide to stabilize the rhythm in the final two feet; Williams
wants
the third part-line seen as part of the triad, but how does it swing
differently from the start of a new line?

How does this--

but being mortal
            can defy our fate.
                         We may

--swing differently from this:

made glorious summer
                by this son of York;

No argument here.  There can't be a definitive translation meeting all
objectives, and religious/spiritual discourse is certainly a legitimate one.

Maria, I just discovered Adrian Castro's "Cantos to Blood & Honey," and am
excited to see poetry that deals with the Yoruba influence on Caribbean
history/religion/spirituality/culture, especially the orishas and the bata
(the sacred drumming).  He is the first poet I've seen to include so much
about the Yoruba/Santeria religion & music in his work.  Intriguing.

On very short notice I've been recruited to teach 3 sections of Helen
Vendler's version of an Intro to Poetry course.  My question is this:  how do
I let students know about all of the poetries that fall outside of Vendler's
syllabus without alienating or appearing to propagandize them?  Harvard
students, as you might imagine, are extraordinarily grade conscious & really
quite conservative & it's upsetting to them that a TF would have reservations
about the assumptions that underlie a course (for one thing, they implicitly
trust brand names -- Harvard & Vendler are 2 -- and for another -- most
importantly -- it makes it much more difficult for them to predict how I'll
grade their papers).  In the past I think I've only confused & antagonised my
classes. An added complication of course is that the  poetry scene in Boston
is ferociously mainstream.

Which is all to say that I would appreciate hearing from anyone who has had
more success with this sort of thing than I've had.

I've had interns who were undergrads at Harvard (admittedly, on a couple)
complain of how conservative the thinking is about poetry there, how
mainstream it is, too. Seems there should be some way of getting such
people together and Jacques could teach them.

I have had some luck with students schooled that way, though, in turning
the teaching toward various approaches in terms of thinking about what
poems are, how they are made, and what the poet might be up to inside them
-- in a way, attempting to get outside the canon altogether and not worry
much at all about who the poets are and where they come from and who has
decided they are worth teaching, rather paying quite close, physical
attention to the words -- another thing might be to attend to the poets
Vendler and Harvard do approve, but who can't really be domesticated --
like H.D. (who might lead into Duncan quite easily), Stevens, Ashbery, etc.
-- take the canon and change the way it is read.

But then, not knowing Vendler's Intro to Poetry course, I don't know what
you're expected to do -- do you start with Homer, or earlier, or with
Beowulf or Chaucer?

I taught a class that was quite mainstream, and I frequently made the point that
there were poets with other points of view, with alternate agendas, who might be
of interest to the class. Given any reasonable opportunity, I mentioned names &
titles of anthologies & literary journal titles. I also was upfront in letting
the students know that this was the poetry I was actually invested in/interested
in personally, but I didn't really go into the work in class, because that wasn't
what the class was about.

Some of the students pursued my leads, some didn't.

I always made the point that there were other opinions/poetics outside of the
ones we were learning in class, and gave a brief description. Often enough we
teach poets in relation to each other, and this presents the opportunity to
mention that there are alternatives even to the alternatives you are officially
presenting--and I think this gives the student a broader view of poetry/poetics.

But you have to be rather glancing in your asides--otherwise it does seem you're
taking ths class in another direction.

On teaching poetry at Harvard: you might require the students to do a
presentation toward the end of the course on poets who are not on the
syllabus.  Give them a list of poets they should pursue on their own and talk
about.  That list can be comprised of non-mainstream poets.  Then the students
will themselves discover the cognitive dissonances involved and might talk
them through without Jacques's pushing them at all (except quietly, by way of
the list).

i've heard rumor of a book that came from writing experiments done at st.
marks some time ago.  the way the book was described was that it gave
descriptions of the experiments as well as the results.  i also thought the
book was editied by bernadette mayer, but i can't verify that either.  does
anyone know of such a book?

i have found one edited by anne waldman titled "out of this world:", but
i'm still waiting for that one to come through the interlibrary loan.

All the poetries that fall outside of Vendler?   I'm not even sure I'd
be able to name them all, let alone make students aware of them in a
significant way. . .

If the problem is alienation though. . . or the thought that you're teaching
students about "conventions" only to pull the rug out from under them, I
suspect that the question really has very little to do with what is or is not
in the Vendler.  After all. . .if students have been endoctrinated into
literature, it's usually into realistic prose, not poetry.  I know what you
mean by alienating however--but I would sugest that it has as much to do with
the anthology model itself, not whether the poets names are familiar. . .After
all, most of the poets in the Vendler anthology wouldn't get along with each
other at a party.  They're already undermining each others conventions. . .I'm
not saying they're not still representative of some British/American
ideo-BORG.  I'm just saying that the cannonical tradition itself is already
disorienting for students. . . and the more you try to cover. . .the more
disorienting it gets.

I'm saying this in part because I tried to teach against an anthology a couple
of years ago. . . staggering so called traditional poetry with so called
untraditional poetry (though we might disagree with my classifications).  It
sorely tested any notion that I may have had that students apprehend poetry
better through "difference" than continuity. . . The entire class probably
ended up rejected poetry entirely and went on to get M.B.A.s  (and I've
avoided teaching introductory poetry classes since then as well)

By the same token, though:  if the problem is that students have trouble
getting a grip on the fast rush of changing styles. . .than one should
naturally feel compelled to add one or two (chap)books to the syllabus.
Naturally, there's also no reason why these books can't be a half-lobster shy
of a lampost.  From Basho to Kelly.

Doesn't help with the "all" question though. . .

Not to sound totally cynical, but when working with grade obsessed
students, there are two magic words: extra credit.  Used properly, they'll
jump through all sorts of hoops.

Here's a less cynical approach:  let the students pick.  That is, break
them up into small groups, assign each group a problem (that is, a critical
concern that leads away from Vendler and towards other poetries) related to
your reading list, meet with them during your office hours, give them
sources, suggestions, outside readings, etc.  Each group then makes a
presentation to the class.  To keep the grade obsessed on your side, make
sure there are points attached for them to receive credit (grades) for
their work.  Meeting with small groups separately from the class is crucial
for this to work:  what an entire class will obstinately refuse,
complaining and kvetching, small groups will often respond
enthusiastically.

Hope this helps.

You might try pointing them toward some "brand name" anthologists who
incorporate both mainstream and non-mainstream poetry.  I'm thinking
specifically of Kenneth Koch's _Making Your Own Days_, in which he has
Herrick and Herbert ext to Schuyler next to Ginsberg next to Bishop next
to O'Hara next to Auden next to Cendrars to Marianne Moore to Pound to
D.H. Lawrence to WCW's "Della Primavera Trasportata al Morale" -- which is
a start.  There's also Rothenberg's very fun _Revolution of the Word_
(1974?), in which he collects some of the weirder stuff of more
well-knowns.

Well, since no one else has responded to Andrew Rathmann's defense of
Mitchell, perhaps I should.

I'm not persuaded at all by AR's defense. Is the rhyme scheme of Mitchell's
version closer to Rilke's than MacIntyre's? No. As a matter of fact Rilke
is rather fond of rhyming couplets not only in this poem but throughout
'Das Buch der Bilder' [and througout his gesammelte Werke].

=46urthermore M's "plain style" is not more accurate than MacIntyre's or
Herder Norton's: "will never have one" does not translate "baut sich keines
mehr"; it interprets it. Vaguely. Nor is "will sit, read, write long
letters through the evening" an accurate translation of Rilke's "wird
wachen, lesen, lange Briefe schreiben."

AR concludes:

>So what exactly is the complaint against Mitchell?  That his books are
>popular?  That he is interested in poetry not as a cultural artifact, but
>as a religious discourse?  These would seem to be within his rights as an
>author.

The complaint is this. Mitchell is not an author. He is a translator.
Insofar as he is a translator he has no rights. He is or should be the
self-effacing slave of his text. It seems to me that instead Mitchell is a
slave of a "religious" discourse with high sales figures.

Are you saying that he should be more faithful to that discourse than to
his texts?

Pierre Joris somewhere cites what H=F6lderlin did to German in order to
transmit Pindar's Greek. The miracle is that the German has taken on some
of the of dazzling brilliance of Pindar's Greek. In Mitchell's hands, it is
the other way around: the source language is turned into a variation of the
target language.

Do you want a German Rilke in Paris circa 1902 or an American one in Barnes
and Noble circa 1990-something? I'd prefer a translation that makes 90's
English walk & talk more like Rilke's German. Two things result: Germanless
English readers get a better sense of who Rilke actually was, and English
becomes a little richer.

I really don't think that I'm being unfair to Mitchell.

Not sure this applies to the list, but maybe; it concerns how I financed my
habit (writing) I taught 11-18 for a number of years. English, History,
Theatre and then increasingly Computing. Wasnt called IT then and the
content insured that few could cope. That helped build character. The
students were great. They were quite feisty - poor area, though not all were
poor; mostly the children or grand children of immigrants and subject to
heavy racism particularly from the police. Some were inclined to violence;
but the majority were okay. Because there was selection just across a nearby
administrative boundary, though we were called a comprehensive school but in
fact it was a sink. There was a barmy analysis of human ability which banded
students into top 25% middle 50% and bottom 25%. Ours were drawn from the
bototm of the middle and the bottom. Many didn't fit the classification, but
it wasn't completely wrong. They needed a special curriculum and they didn't
get it.

If you were straight with them and got on with the job of teaching them they
were generally fine. The problem was the management who were potty to the
point of malignancy. No backing. Constant pointless change. Interference.
The school declined rapidly and eventually closed.

Obviously that isnt the case with all schools or even many, but the
difficulties we had are shared by pretty well all of the others to a lesser
degree. Next school much the same.

I got out of that and went to Further Education i.e. some post 16 many post
18 below degree level usually

everything was fine for a couple of years and then the government privatised
it

FE had been a haven for all sorts of wild life - people like me who, in my
analysis, wanted a way of earning some money that didn't make us feel
immoral, people - I think like me - who had come to the conclusion that
teaching was one of the best things a person can do; and various wasters who
weren't good for much and sheltered under the stones of FE. After
privatisation that third category became the management of the colleges.

Massive drop in resources, pressure to fake grades, in all the varieties of
activity that can breed; bullying; time wasting; lowering of standards... I
got out. Meanwhile my secondary school friends (11-18) are reporting
impossible targets, bullying, lack of resources

and it makes it that much more difficult to stay alive to make poetry

It isn't teaching now but training parrots and preparing bogus portfolios

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

From Sedgwick's _Tendencies_, an autoexegesis of one of her own poems:

"The more than exhibitionsim, the blissful new vocational pride of this
poem (much though I _have_, in this reproduction of it, hurried past); the
wracking and politically expsensive divorce of the tightly zoned and
abjected female body from the enfranchised female voice; the many
filaments with which the poem binds its personnel to their multiple and
changing stations in the culture of the "examination"; the equivocal
address of this letter by which the demarcation of private from public is
erotically exploited even as it is generically defied or transformed; the
po-faced relish of mimicry that confuses the power relations of observer
and observed; the half occluded agressiveness with which the autoerotic
enactment of the poem both provokes and deprecates the fury of the
impinged upon reader, and the fatuous insistence with which it solicits
and pretends to ignore the desire that is the unnamed engine of the
fury--all are condensed in the "thud / of longing" with which the
contracted, bodily siting of the drama of enjambment is displaced back
outward onto the sheepish hungry gaze from the wedged-open door."


dichten = condensare. I wish my line breaks could express so much.  But
why write bad poetry if you can write bad prose?

I'd like to see Stephen Mitchell translate this or Helen Vendler explicate
it.

One of the greatest successes I've had as far as an individual text goes
is teaching _Dictee_ by Theresa Hak Kyung Cha. Ways into this from
VendlerLand? Start charting out the relationship of poetry/poetics/poets
to the visual arts. New York School--obvious--canonical choices there.
Then provide a contemporary example such as Cha who was also a filmmaker
and visual artist. There's also a lot that can be done in terms of
examining what a "personal narrative" what encompass--always a favorite
of self-obsessed undergrads, Harvard or otherwise.

My advice: Don't think in terms oppositions (good/bad,
canonical/noncanonical) but instead provide examples around the map that
illustrate different ways of thinking and composing. And just think, you
have the opportunity to teach students how to read poetry. Most college
English majors don't know how to read the stuff, but a great teacher can
open that door. Have fun!

1. About the Poetics List

The Poetics List was founded in late 1993 with the epigraph above.

There are presently over 650 subscribers (9/28/98).

Please note that this is a private list and information about the list=
 should
not be posted to other lists or directories of lists. The idea is to keep=
 the
list to those with specific rather than general interests, and also to keep
the
scale of the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List, while committed to openness, is moderated. While=
 individual
posts of participants are sent directly to all subscribers, we continue to
work
to promote the editorial function of this project. The definition of that
project, while provisional, and while open to continual redefinition by list
participants, is nonetheless aversive to a generalized discussion of poetry.
Rather, our aim is  to support, inform, and extend those directions in=
 poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and styles, and to=
 the
creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible. **We also encourage subscribers to post information on
publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in=
 which
they appear (see section 9 below).** (THIS MEANS *YOU*).

Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,=
 and
become part of an on-line archive. *Posting to Poetics is a form of
publication, not personal communication.* Participants are asked to exercise
caution before posting messages! While spontaneity of response may seem the
very heart of the list at its best, it also has the darker side of=
 circulating
ideas that have not been well considered (or considered by another reader --
editor or friend). Given the nature of the medium, subscribers do well to
maintain some skepticism when reading the list and, where possible, to try=
 to
avoid taking what may be something close to a spontaneous comment made in=
 the
heat of exchange as if it were a revised or edited essay ("Let the Reader
Beware!").

The "list owner" of Poetics is Charles Bernstein. Joel Kuszai is list
manager.=20
For subscription information contact us at POETICS@acsu.buffalo.edu.

___________________________________________________________

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to Poetics are free of charge. But we ask that you subscribe
with
your real name and we reserve the right to request additional information,
including address and phone number. All subscription information you supply
will remain confidential.

You can subscribe (sub) or unsubscribe (unsub) by sending a one-line=
 message,
with no subject line, to:

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

the one-line message should say:

unsub poetics

{or}

sub poetics Jill Jillway

(replacing Jill Jillway with your own name; but note: do not use your name=
 to
unsub)

We will be sent a notice of all subscription activity. Please allow several
days for your new or re-subscription to take effect.

*

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:

Sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator.  If this happens you will not be able to send messages to
Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to get your Poetics
mail.  To avoid this, unsub from the old address and resub from the new
address.  If you can no longer do this there is a solution if you use Eudora
(an e-mail program that is available free at shareware sites): from the=
 Tools
menu select "Options" and then select set-up for "Sending Mail": you may be
able to substitute your old address here and send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If your
system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics messages may=
 get
bounced.  Please try avoid having messages from the list returned to us. If
the
problem is low disk quota, you may wish to request an increase from your
system
administrator. (You may wish to argue that this subscription is part of your
scholarly communication!) You may also wish to consider obtaining a=
 commercial
account.

In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your account, your
subscription to Poetics will be temporarily suspended. If this happens,=
 simply
resubscribe to the list in the normal manner, once your account problem has
been resolved.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual subscription=
 or
subscription policy, should be addressed to the list's administrative=
 address:
poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu. Please note that it may take up to ten days, or
more,
for us to reply to messages.
____________________________________________________________________

3.  Cautions

Please do not post to the list personal or backchannel correspondence, or
other
unpublished material, without the express permission of the author.=
 Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material from=
 this
list and its archive may not be reproduced without the author's permission,
beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use".

The Poetics List has a 50 message daily limit. If more than 50 messages are
received, the listserver will automatically hold those additional messages
until the list is manually unlocked, usually the following day. While it is
difficult to prescribe a set limit on the number of daily, weekly, or=
 monthly
posts for any  subscriber, please keep this limit in mind. If you plan to
respond to multiple threads, it is generally preferable to consolidate your
reply into one message. While relevant excerpts from a post to which you are
responding may usefully be appended to your reply, please do not include in
your new post the whole text of a long previously posted message. As an
outside
maximum, the listserv is set to accept no more than 5 messages a day from=
 any
one subscriber.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long documents in a=
 post,
since this may make it difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or
who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics (especially
reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may also become part of
specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are
always welcome. (See section 7.)

Please do not send inquiries to the list to get an individual subscribers
address. To get this information, see section 6.

If you want someone to send out information to the list as a whole, or=
 supply
information missing from an post, or thank someone for posting something you
requested, please send the request or comment to the individual backchannel,
not to the whole list.

____________________________________________________________________

4. Digest Option

The Listserve program gives you he option to receive all the posted Poetics
message each day as a single message. If you would prefer to receive ONE
message each day, which would include all messages posted to the list for=
 that
day, you can use the digest option.  Send this one-line message (no subject
line) to

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

set poetics digest

NOTE:!! Send this message to "listserv" not to Poetics or as a reply to this
message!!

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this message:

set poetics mail
____________________________________________________________________

5. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are going to be away
for
any extended period of time! Your account may become flooded and you may=
 lose
not only Poetics messages but other important mail. You can temporarily turn
off your Poetics subscription by sending a message to
"listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu"

set poetics nomail

& turn it on again with: set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from the Poetics
archive. (See 8 below.)

____________________________________________________________________

6. Who's Subscribed

To see who is subscribed to Poetics, send an e-mail message to
listserv@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu; leave the "Subject" line of the e-mail
message blank.  In the body of your e-mail message type:

review poetics

You will be sent within a reasonable amount of time (by return e-mail) a
rather
long list containing the names and e-mail addresses of Poetics subscribers.=
=20
This list is alphabetized by server not name.

or try:

review POETICS by name review POETICS by country

which will give you the list alphabetically by name or a flawed list by
country
(since all ".com" and ".net"s are counted as US)

*Please do not send a message to the list asking for the address of a=
 specific
subscriber.*
____________________________________________________________________

7. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

our URL is

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

The mission of this World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to=
 serve
as a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of activity in formally
innovative writing in the United States and the world.  The Center provides
access to the burgeoning number of electronic resources in the new poetries
including RIF/T and other electronic poetry journals, the POETICS List
archives, an AUTHOR library of electronic poetic texts, and direct=
 connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides=
 information
about contemporary print little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in=
 poetry
and poetics. And we have an extensive collection of soundfiles of poets'
reading their work, as well as the archive of LINEbreak, the radio interview
series.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.
____________________________________________________________________

8. Poetics Archives via EPC

Go to the EPC and select Poetics from the opening screen. Follow the links=
 to
Poetics Archives. You may browse the archives by month and year or search=
 them
for specific information. Your interface will allow you to print or download
any of these files.

Or set your browser to go directly to:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/poetics/archive

____________________________________________________________________

9. Publishers & Editors Read This!

PUBLISHERS & EDITORS: Our listings of poetry and poetics information is open
and available to you. We are trying to make access to printed publications=
 as
easy as possible to our users and ENCOURAGE you to participate! Send a list=
 of
your press/publications to glazier@acsu.buffalo.edu with the words EPC Press
Listing in the subject line. You may also send materials on disk. (Write=
 file
name, word processing program, and Mac or PC on disk.) Send an e-mail=
 message
to the address above to obtain a mailing address to which to send your disk.
Though files marked up with html are our goal, ascii files are perfectly
acceptable. If your word processor will save files in Rich Text Format=
 (.rtf)
this is also highly desirable

Send us extended information on new publications (including any back cover
copy
and sample poems) as well as complete catalogs/backlists (including excerpts
from reviews, sample poems, etc.).  Be sure to include full information for
ordering--including prices and addresses and phone numbers both of the press
and any distributors.

Initially, you might want to send short announcements of new publications
directly to the Poetics list as subscribers do not always (or ever) check=
 the
EPC; in your message please include full information for ordering.  If you
have
a fuller listing at EPC, you might also mention that in any Poetics posts.

Some announcements circulated through Poetics and the EPC have received a
noticeable responses; it may be an effective way to promote your publication
and we are glad to facilitate information about interesting publications.

Check with Teachers and Writers in NY. They have a wealth of interesting
writing experiment books-- new ones all the time.

Believe it or not, innovative practice can be included side-by-side with
the more traditional syllabus as long as you're able to stretch
definitions.  Maybe the traditional syllabus says, for example,
autobiography or uses of the personal.  Maybe "Daddy" by Plath is there.
Why not juxtapose it with sections of "My Life" by Hejinian?  Students
then can see the range of what personal can mean.

Maybe Czech? Ladislav Novak has some along those lines, one called
individualista (in Solt, Concrete Poetry: A World view, 139) Or Josef
Hirsal and Bohumila Grogerova, Czechs, same, 144-5? Evidently the Novak
poems come from a book called Pocta Jacksonu Pollockovi, 1966. Now that's
cool! good luck with the search, Sylvester Pollet

Or, as an assignment/project, give the students a list of alternative
anthologies, and ask them to write about the different assumptions
that govern Vendler vs. the other anthology.  Or, have them write
about the different standards for "good" poetry in the two
anthologies.

I've had pretty good luck in contemporary poetry classes with having
the students read two different anthologies.  Sometimes, they end up
doing a final project which involves selecting and introducing an
anthology of their own making.

You might also create other assignments that take them
to perspectives outside Vendler:  have them go to the Electronic
Poetry Center and browse various magazines and author sites.  They
might even read Hejinian, Bernstein, Creeley, S. Howe--and they could
still retain brand loyalty (Harvard), but discover different possible
Harvards?  Or, they might listen to Cage's Norton Lectures (at
Harvard) and ask what is the relationship of his poetics to
Vendler's?  I suspect that some of the antagonism and confusion
you've experienced in prior classes will be inevitable if and as you
challenge what Vendler has created as the "best" of poetry.  Perhaps
the place to begin is with the process of judgment?

Evguenie Sokolov  by Serge Gainsbourg (1928-1991)
ISBN  0-9662346-1-8     Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 97-80957
Translated from the  French by John and Doreen Weightman

        This is the one and only novel by the 20th century provocateur of
French pop music and film  - the legendary Serge Gainsbourg .   This
prototype lusty punk tore into the threads of French society with his
numerous films, music projects, and outlandish persona.   He made
recordings with Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin  and a scandalous recording of
"Lemon Incest" with his own daughter Charlotte.   If that wasn't bad
enough, he told Whitney Houston  live on French TV that he would love  'to
fuck' her.

        Evguenie Sokolov  is a novel about an artist who uses his
intestinal gases as the medium for his scandalous artwork.  What once was a
huge smelly and noisy problem in his social and sex life becomes a tool for
success in the early eighties art world.   Please note that there is also a
song by Gainsbourg called Evguenie Sokolov  of farting noises over a reggae
track.

Some quotes about Gainsbourg and the novel:



"Gainsbourg is both the best and the worst, yin and yang, white and black.
This Jewish little Prince from Russia whose dreams were probably fueled by
Andersen, Perrault and Grimm, became, when confronted by the tragic reality
of life, a moving or repugnant Quasimodo, depending on his and your state
of mind.  Hidden deep within this fragile, shy and aggressive man lies the
soul of a poet craving tenderness, truth and integrity."   Brigitte Bardot

"Serge Gainsbourg is one of the world's great eccentrics.  His kinky
obsessions, smothering fashion with tastelessness have catapulted him into
super stardom in France.

This is his only novel and you have never read anything like it  Evgueine
Sokolov will make you squirm.  It will make you laugh.  It also may very
well make you sick.  Gainsbourg's vision is his own: authentic and
convulsive.  But don't forget to hold your nose."   John Zorn

Gainsbourg takes one childish, cheap and tasteless one-joke idea and
manages to keep it entertaining enough to last for a whole book. he has an
envious command of adjectives and adverbs." Mark Webber, Pulp

For those who are interested, this book can be special ordered thru Amazon
and Barnes & Noble website as well as thru your local independent
bookstore.

Thanks,

   Went to a reading yesterday in Brooklyn, hosted by Prageeta Sharma,
   of the two aforementioned writers---and found both of them
   worth listening to, but in lieu of a reading report
   (I'm one of those people who usually needs to "see it on
    the page" first), I wanted to bring up a point concerning
   DIDACTICISM in poetry that was raised by Kyle Connor (Oh, shit,
   scratch---the "O'connor" from the title line)....
   He read these poems that he (defensively?) called "didactic"
   and people in the audience (well, some) were "rolling their
   eyes" in smug(?) disapproval as he read them, even with his
   disclaimer. Now, I wonder WHY is DIDACTICISM a TABOO in much
   "avant-garde?" I don't think it's just Kyle's particular poems
   that was being reacted to, though perhaps the dry declamatory
   mode in which he read them did have something to do with the
   eye-rolling? But even if he had read them (performed them)
   differently, maybe there still would have been much of the
   same dismissal. It's a question Im curious about, and maybe
   the emphasis on "poetry readings" (particularly on "coterie
   poetry readings" in which most of the audience is going to
   be considered the "converted" (or the "choir") one "preaches"
   to) over poetry on the page has something to do with the taboo.
   I mean that reading the work at home--in "solitude"--it may
   not come off as negatively didactic as it would in the
   "levelling" crowd. Nor do I want to say that Connor should
   simply go to the Nuyorican or other slam-venues where didacticism
   is more appreciated, because even there I find style eclipses
   substance. Well, curious what anybody might think of these
   and related issues.....
   more later, chris

Well, I can't speak for the (rest of the) 'avant-garde', but I'm wary of
didacticism in poetry for a number of reasons.

- Primarily, it's because didacticism implies to me that the author has it
all worked out, and that he or she is going to tell us how to think. It
leaves no room for dialogue or ambiguity.

- Wouldn't a didactic poem require a unified voice and a pre-determined
meaning? This is unlikely to appeal to langpos.

- While I can see that didacticism has its place, I think that it belongs
in textbooks and editorials. Technical & rhetorical prose tries to edge
language towards precision and logic, which is not a bad thing in itself.
But poetry seems a better medium for doubt, internal debate, contradiction,
openness, ambivalence, elusiveness and just plain nuttiness.

Which is not to say, of course, that poems can't cover the ground normally
covered by essays or manifestos. I just prefer it when the poem is itself a
process of discovery and argument, not the end result.

Out of curiosity (and other things)--

When did Serge write this book?  Sounds utterly fascinating.

Is it true that there is an upcoming issue of EPOCH devoted to experimental
fiction?

I'd be curious to see who all is in that, see if there's any crossover among
the poets/fiction writers.

A very didactic response, no?   But then you aren't writing poetry. . .

I'd assume that most people associate didacticism with that vertically
imposed clarity of style that is so offensive in some political
statements, and people who write--though not just poets--are a little
more self-conscious about popping people, things, actions into one
classification or another (and that includes didactic vs. non-didactic
people, things and actions).

As to whether this is what Stroffolino was posting about. . .I can't
say, I wasn't there.  For all I know the eye-rolling had more to do with
the embarassment that poets would dismissive their own work out of hand,
or embarrassment that one should have to apologize for being didactic. .
. I could spend a great deal of time arguing over the semantics of a
term like "didactic" (Are the Creedos in Conjunction 21 negatively
didactic?  Is Wole Soyinka?  Is Charles Olson?  Is there a difference
between pedagogical and didactic?  If a poem brings us to conclusions
through a "process of discovery and argument" are those conclusions less
didactic than the conclusions of the rhetorician--or is the poet just a
slyer rhetorician?)  but it seems to me if poets are apologizing for
their didacticism, than why shouldn't we expect the worst?  What. .

No no experience at all in that.  A "sister-in-law" went to middle school
there and likes the Goosebumps series very much.  She is now in Boston,
getting prepped for Vendler, no doubt.

Has this something to do wth the purchase of Manchester United & the

Yes. I don't know Connor's work, so I can't comment on the specifics, but I
think we all know examples of poems that _are_ exasperatingly didactic.

It's a difference of connotation, perhaps. I'd read "didactic", in Louis'
post, as being close to "preachy". I love writing that's full of _stuff_,
that teaches us obscure details about mediaeval heresies or Mexican cuisine
or stamp collecting. But this is different from telling us what to think.

As long as the emphasis is on our _own_ conclusions, rather than being
forced to agree with the poets', then I wouldn't call it didactic.


        Cheers,

The three World anthologies are prose and poetry books.

A lot of St. Mark-type language experiments are found among many Teacher &
Writer Books as excercises for students

Bernadette mayer's list of language experiments is found in the reissued
LABGUAGE BOOK

Subject:      walking before running (teaching poetry)

i suspect i'm about to make myself obnoxious to at least one or two
people but here goes my cap over the dam...

don't know vendler's anthology/syllabs.  but i don't think a very
traditional syllabus is a bad start for learning to read poetry.  i
think, by virtue of having twigged onto existence of list, everyone
here is probably already an "expert" poetry reader and forgets that...

reading poetry is HARD!

when one has been reading it for a long time, it is easy to forget those
first baby steps.  even if they ARE from harvard, i think the students
are, at least some of them, probably very much beginners in poetry.

starting with a very traditional anthology means students get a chance
to slowly work their way up the history of poetry, acquire a complex
frame of reference, learn the "in" jokes.  i think the idea of having
a final student presentation of off-syllabus work, with a list of
suggested writers, is a great idea, but i would not confine students
to list.  i'd ask that they look at work from at least a few of
suggested writers (have handy -- what the heck, harvard has money --
xerox one or two poems each from your suggested list), and if none of
these writers appeals to them, have them pick their own but say they
must o.k. it with you a solid amount of time in advance, and specify
no duplicates.  it would be interesting to see who they come up with.

i wouldn't let them start picking till at least a good way through
semester, so they'll have some reading sophistication to use in
choosing.  if there are any students fluent in another language, you
could suggest that they consider picking someone who writes in that
other language.  if student wants to choose someone who is not widely
translated, have them read one poem in original language (providing
translation as well) so people get sense of sound of original.  have
everyone xerox a selection of poems (3-7) from their chosen poet, and
provide packet of these poems to class a couple of weeks in advance of
presentations so people have time to read.

this would let you slip in a whole new feature to syllabus which is
student-chosen.  even the grade grubs will sit up and take notice if
you put hefty grade value on presentation.  you could specify "living
poets" except there are some very interesting experimental writing
from older writers.

anyway, that is my 50 cents on subject.

There's also THE ART OF SCIENCE WRITING, edited by Mayer w/ Dale Worsley,
which consists of exeriments and examples re: writing about science
(imaginatively and otherwise). It's geared mostly towards high school and
early college students, but is certainly worth checking out. (It's written
as a textbook for use in science courses).

I don't know about a whole book but 56 of these experiments can be found
in

boundary 2 23:3,1996   i use them in poetry workshops with high school
kids all the time. what is also an added bonus is that the immediate
preceding page is the last section of an interview with Charles Bernstein
that acts as a great little pep talk for me when i go into a new class.

You mean you haven't had an experience like that? or she didn't? OR I
didn't? Well, I did and so do many still. Highest ever sickness rates. Cases
going before courts for bullying and heavier stuff. Because your sister in
law went to an okay school and didnt notice - as a pupil? they wouldn't see
the bullying etc of teachers by teachers - doesn't mean it isn't happening
elsewhere. Also, perhaps I didn't make clear, my experience was of a
particular kind of inner city school but the diseases wch have been let
loose in FE are now affecting pretty well all schools... They can't recruit
enough teachers any more

Our chief inspector of schools wants to go back to kings and queens history
and believes that everything canbe measured by the same yardstick. We have a
national curriculum which changes by the month with deep prescription. Lives
are being wasted - I was being quite serious and, at the risk of going off
poetics task, trying to pass on useful experience. So I didn't expect
facetious disbelief. I am not at all interested in M.U. or any other lost
continent of sport. And the weather has been fine.

A tourist a few years back said to a Greek in my hearing, listen I've been
in Turkey for SIX WEEKS so I KNOW; you guys should get together


Anyway, think what you want. I'm going back to poetry while I wait for my
time in court to come round

The domain of poet Will Alexander’s nervy curiosity ranges from the icy
Himalayas, to African savannahs, from physics. astronomy, and music, to
alchemy, philosophy, and painting. Orishas, angels and ghosts all sing
to this poet, instructing him in their art of verbal flight. This is a
poet whose lexicon, a “glossary of vertigo,” might be culled from the
complete holdings of a reconstituted Alexandrian library endowed for the
next millenium.
--Harryette Mullen

Will Alexander’s writing is “movement / as dialectical alterity.” In
reading Above the Human Nerve Domain, one recognized that what one
thinks and one’s corpus are both “subjective exclusivity.” On this
“language of disrupted ghosts” thought is corpus, “a body condensed in
grace.” --Leslie Scalapino

Will Alexander’s dazzling Above the Human Nerve Domain embraces the here
and now, the after and the before. Scanning its images, words roll
around the mind’s cavernous tongue. There is the feeling of being lost
in the returned gaze of this quantum diorama, here primary and human,
here blended apart from itself. But upon second seeing confusion seems
to evaporate and the gaze of the diorama seems simultaneous with our
own. The inner and outer don’t cease to exist but are given equal
footing to comment on one another “in which mnemonic trance /
co-intuits” as we’re reading this writer “with active double eurekas.”
--Diane Ward

This glorious set of whirling prosodic proofs exult that a body can be
struck by stanzaic facts of light. The reader is dazzled by expanding
forms of predictory anaphora arriving as an “intstantaneous beam.” The
author of  Vertical Rainbow Climber, Arcane Lavender Morals, Asia &
Haiti, and The Stratospheric Canticles has done it again with strobic
precision.
--Norma Cole

Right Livelihood by David Brooks
---------------------

De Gustibus




What if eros resided in the
stomach instead of the loins?
Imagine that first freudian
shock when the child wanders
into the room and there’s
mommy and daddy— eating steak!
Think of the nervousness
of teenagers having first soup,
think of pizza in the back seat
on Saturday night!

The whole business of dinner would
be taboo: subjects like how much
is it normal to eat at one time
or what if your dinner partner
doesn’t seem satisfied suppressed
for centuries, until the invention
of the talk show. There would be
a whole pornography based on food,
right down to the stupid letters in Penthouse :
“I came home and there was
Bernice eating buffalo wings
with a stranger on my living room floor.
I got so excited I pulled out a bag
of pretzels and ate them all myself!”

Think of the unhappiness of confining
food to marriage, when deep down
we all know someone we wouldn’t mind
having a snack with. How lewd now
seems the business lunch,
the honorary banquet! And what
about those who sneak a little grub
on the side? We’d punish a woman for
eating around, but a man’s gotta eat when
a man’s gotta eat, you see.

After all we are better off with
the grief from our groins than living
in a world of anorexic saints, fearing
the premature desert. Too sad
to think of all those 900 numbers—
you call someone up and they make it
sound like its Thanksgiving dinner,
but if you knew the truth, it’s someone
who could care less about food,
someone who couldn’t tell
fois gras from Peter Pan.

If I had an hour class to teach, I would read 2 poems in class, one from
the Vendler list & one of your own choosing.  2 short poems.  Then I
would "lecture" on them, half hour each, with all the references, ideas,
sidelights, background, foreground, weird slants, etc. that you can come
up with.  I would start encouraging feedback from the 1st class & expect
students to be active in the discussions as they get used to it.

I think you can give a class all the lists, anthologies & suggested readings
you want but without that close extended encounter, they won't have the
tools or the motivation to explore much.  (by background I mean not just
purely literary, but poet's bios, history, politics...)

chapbook series...

POTES & POETS' FIRST CHAPBOOK SERIES

Please order from SPD, 1341 Seventh Ave, Berkeley CA 94710
or tel. 1-800-869-7553

ISBN PREFIX: 0-937013-

Drafts of the Sorcery.  Jake Berry.   $7.00   -81-1   *37pp

Jake Berry composed the 4 poems of Drafts of the Sorcery during the four
seasons of the year beginning with autumnal equinox 1997. They are
experiments in various approaches that will eventually be included in
his long work BRAMBU DREZI, the second book of which was released by
Pantograph Press in spring 1998. Berry has published 15 books of poetry.
He is also a folk musician, his first CD, Shadow Resolve appeared in
1997 from Front Porch, and he has just completed a second collection of
original songs with Wayne Sides, performing under the name Bare
Knuckles.


Studio As History.  Ryan Whyte.    $7.00     -78-1    *39pp

After the failure of the twentieth century's avant-gardes to liberate
art
from the confines of class and institution, it is perhaps necessary to
re-examine the structures of those very confines. 'Studio as History'
posits the myth of the Studio as the tain of a mirror which enables the
art-world to continue to reverse the conditions of the 'real,' economic
world of power and thus widen the gulf between art and life. A work of
speculative historiography, this essay ranges among Greek history,
Scholasticism, Romanticism, and phenomenology. Its author, Ryan Whyte,
is
an artist and critic.


Subterfuge for the Unrequitable. Carrie Etter.    $6.00 -79-X  *27pp

A collection of poems that contemplate the erotic as a subterfuge
for the unrequitable, masking while inevitably revealing the
discreteness of bodies and minds.  Ron Silliman comments, "To
'register the tongue's torque,' Carrie Etter's poems show great
skill and a willingness to take risks, both rare things in a
'first book.' This writing is simultaneously 'out there' and
always also immediately present (in the most literal sense of
'with it'), an experience that is by turns centering and
dizzying.  It's quite a ride."


Quite Vacation. Jack Kimball.   $6.00 -83-8    *27pp

A serialized, noirish gallop across tones and attitudes of language.
Each verse stands on its own yet radiates outward to engage all the
other co-conspirators in the sequence.  Had Wieners or O'Hara wed the
frog princess, their firstborn might have sounded like Kimball.
Dickinsonian without parsimony, Spicerly without rancor.  Alan Sondheim
comments, "Just wonderful, that's all I can say, wonderful."


Improvisations / Transformations.  Jim Leftwich.   $7.00 -76-5  *45pp

Three poems: *Alto Ossia*, *Unambiguous Eggs*  and *Unambiguous Eggs*
full of neologisms, unusual visual spacings, and dense musical text make
up this unique chapbook from the editor of JUXTA and JUXTA/ELECTRONIC.
From *Alto Ossia*:  "yntaxtly em to dyne. meat rose singerprints fght
mission. …" Words, sentences and poems on the edge of meaning that
tantalize the reader's mind to finesse around the spaces between reality
and pure syntactic innovation.



Little Wives.  Barbara Cole.   -82-X     $7.00   *35pp

*little wives*  "...aims at nothing less than re-entering the
women of modernism--producers, compromised producers, and triumphant
poets, as well as re-locating significant creations of male modernists
(Molly Bloom) that have structured thinking about the female character
in
the 20th century." -- Rachel Blau DuPlessis.
Barbara Cole recently completed her M.A. in Creative Writing -- Poetry
at
Temple University.  An editor of the the new poetry magazine, *pH*, her
second chapbook, *postcards*, is due out in Winter 1998 from
BeautifulSwimmer Press.



Sarah Mangold.   Blood Substitutes.     $7.00   -77-3   *45pp

"I sometimes  :skip skip:  it's about// affection it's all a fiction// I
wanted - - I'm - - a place// wolves to the lake//. . .".   Mangold has
been published in Fourteen Hills and The Midland Review. She was born
in 1971 in Omaha, Nebraska and grew up in Kansas and Oklahoma.
She received a BA from the University of Oklahoma and is currently a MFA
candidate at San Francisco State University.  This work represents a
diaristic venture into the poet's daily life that is enigmatic in its
short phrases and disjunct manner of reporting that life.


Music, No Staves.  Katy Lederer.   $6.00   -80-3     *22pp.

In MUSIC, NO STAVES, which begins as an elegy and ends as a love poem,
Lederer explores the relationship between father and daughter via a
series of traditional, though nonetheless scandalous tropes.  The form
of the poem - which is sometimes mimetic, sometimes disruptive, but
always furtive in its effects-acts as counterpoint to the gravity of the
subject-matter.  Originally from New Hampshire, Katy Lederer lives
in New York City, where she edits Explosive Magazine.  She has
another chapbook out from idiom press entitled Faith.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

When I try to think of didactic poems I am fond of they are all tongue in
cheek, like Koch's "Some General Instructions" or Notely's hilarious
extension of this concept in a poem I read recently in her selected poems.

Of course, Pound is very DIDACTIC also, that is what that "village
explainer" quip was all about.

Williams picks up on this Poundian tone when he takes that "Let me tell
you, my townspeople, how to conduct a funeral" or "Rather notice, mon
cher, how the steeple" tone. Wrongly or rightly, most contemporary readers
don't like to be brow-beaten. What is didactic is not the conveyance of a
message per se, but a certain rhetorical gesture equivalent to grabbing
you by the lapels. There are powerful poems that we might not think of as
didactic because they skip this gesture, The Crowd at the ball game, The
Yachts, In Chains:

When blackguards and murderers
under cover of their offices
accuse the world of those villainies
which they themselves invent to
torture us--we have no choice
but to bend to their designs,
buck them or be trampled while
our thoughts gnaw, snap and bite
within us helplessly--unless
we learn from that to avoid
being as they are, how love
will rise out of its ashes if
we water it, tie up its slender
stem and keep the image of its
lively flower chiseled upon our minds.

The students had already elected courses numbered 1, 2, and 3, without
knowing what was to be taught or who was to teach. If their new professor
had asked what idea was in their minds, they must have replied that
nothing at all was in their minds, since their professor had nothing in
his, and down to the moment he
took his chair and looked his scholars in the face, he had given, as far as
he could remember, an
hour, more or less, to the Middle Ages. ...

The only teaching that appealed to his imagination was a course of lectures
by Louis Agassiz on the Glacial
Period and Paleontology, which had more influence on his curiosity than the
rest of the college
instruction altogether. The entire work of the four years could have been
easily put into the work of
any four months in after life. ...

The task was doomed to failure for a reason which he could not control.
Nothing is easier than to
teach historical method, but, when learned, it has little use. History is a
tangled skein that one may
take up at any point, and break when one has unravelled enough; but
complexity precedes evolution.
The Pteraspis grins horribly from the closed entrance. ...

Thousands of men have to do the same thing, but his case was peculiar
because he had no need to do it. He did it because his best and wisest
friends urged it, and he never could make up his mind whether they were
right or not. To him this kind of education was always false. For himself
he had no doubts. He thought it a mistake; but his opinion did not prove
that it was one, since, in all probability, whatever he did would be more
or less a mistake. He had reached cross-roads of education which all led
astray. What he could gain at Harvard College
he did not know, but in any case it was nothing he wanted.

Chris drops another bombshell on the list - we haven't had many lately.

Why is didacticism taboo among the "avant-garde"?  he asks.  But the word
has a negative ring not just among the avant-garde.  Joseph Brodsky was one
not-so-avant-gardist who thought & wrote in various ways that aesthetics
precedes, underwrites, ethics.  This probably had more to do with his
position in Russian poetry than in the West.  But it seems pretty
representative among artists.

Chris's described audience may have rolled their eyes because art is
a kind of discipline, a cultus.  The askesis of invisible poetry is
rewarded with a shared experience "purified" of extraneous issues.
The cultus in fact finds didacticism unethical within the system in
which art is enclosed in its own play sphere.

The irony is that "alternative" art is in part an alternative to a
society perceived to have lost its bearings.  A sort of fallen world
in which public discourse & the institutions that underwrite it -
public schools, journalism, politics, local communities, shared
labors - are seen variously as corrupt, confused, betrayed, misled,
oppressive, oppressed, etc.

I don't happen to agree with the Brodsky view; I don't think either
ethics or aesthetics are "prior" to one another.  Thus the idea of
a poetry that teaches, or denounces, is not automatically anti-
aesthetic; nor is a poetry that skillfully renders itself as
art-for-art's-sake necessarily poetry.  One must take a deep breath
and consider the radical idea that poetry might speak with
authority & glee at the same time.  Hey Pushkin!

Chris --

Well, Kyle _did_ apologize four or five times for the didacticism --
so that the apology (as well as the didacticism)
became a running gag
at which the audience members were almost _supposed_ to roll their eyes --
not to mention suspend the inquiry
as to whether these poems were in fact instructional --
didn't you think they were more moral
(a la Laforgue or early Eliot?) than instructional?
Nice to hear an epigraph from Valery in 1998 --
the ur-Wittgenstein?

--

Also, with all this talk about didacticism and Kyle's enjoyable stance
Rachel's wild funny thoughtful reading seems to have been set aside -- do
writers come out of schools? Rachel seems recognizably _of_ Naropa, in that
she's much more interested in accumulating energy than in dispelling it with
asides and remarks, but there's critical thought along with the joy -- is
this all hooey I'm saying? maybe, anyway, looking forward to further
readings and writings from Kyle and Rachel -- Jordan

     No boke of experiments from Poetry Project, tho' the Mayer list of
writing experiments can be found at project website -- www.poetry

Paul Beatty, Brenda Coultas, Jackson MacLow, Rosa Alcala, Alice Notley &
bunches of others.

     I would second the first hand for Teachers & Writers books --
Padgett-edited book of forms, Larry Fagin's book on the list poem, & lots
of others which Jordan Davis could elaborate on with more depth; would
even say that the book on forms might be the thing for Jacques' Harvard
poetry section.

As to didactic being a little on the taboo side in poetry; maybe it's a
good enough thing, 'cuz pieces I find to be faux-didactic (tongue in

You're going to have to pry our didacticism from our cold unmoving
hands.

To start up a reading series call everyone you know and convince a few
of them that they are poets until they start to write something then ask
them to retype it and ask them to send it to Epoch and stand up among a
group of other acoyoltes who have been trained in the same capacity and
switch back and forth. Until their mouths are dacytl weapons. A pack of
poets is best to groom. That way they can rob and loot others and split
the gun rental cost five ways in order to support their craft. Never
apologize unless it's funny or can be made so. Blood rituals are
necessary so a knife is in order. I am sorry we made pirogues out of
your grandmother, but we thought you should have some. They are your
pirogues now. Have the weakest member of the pack read and explain
experimental poetries to toughen them. Suggest a metrical structure
which emphasizes heavy breathing in so far as to allow them to write
poems throughout the day. Banks have more money than bodegas. Hand over
the signed hardcover first editions. I am sorry you are better looking
than your mother. Have one of them be a huffer of any known propellant
forms. This will thicken the plot of your story especially if one gets a
good dose of airplane glue in their nose. Since fiction pays better this
could help in the long haul. Calling yourself a poet is a cop out and a
breech of poetics. Have a secret poetic handshake. Like this. I'm sorry.
Make sure they know they are in it for the long haul. That leaving or
staying with poetry will kill them, one faster than the other.

Jordan: Kyle comes from the Philadelphia school if this was really a
school. Perhaps it would "include" all the folks who centered around my
house for two years starting about  four yrs ago for a workshop that met
once or twice a month : Valerie Hanson, Kevin Varrone, Ethel Rackin, Ron
Powerhaus Swegman, Major Jackson, Steve Potter, Dave Simpson, Laura
Wilder, Ron Wandover, Matt Danish and others.  Except for a sense of
magick there, as evidenced through the amount published afterwards, the
journals edited since, the reading series run, that we're real active,
what else is there to say. Except this.

Be well

Precisely! In fact I taught Plath right up against Cha in the class in
which Cha was a top-of-the-charts hit. I used the rubric of "identities"
and the "personal" throughout the semester, and the students at San
Francisco State really responded to all the "difficult" texts I put
before them. In fact my willingness to teach such a variety of work
really allowed the students to loosen up in their own creative
experiments. What it's really about is igniting the students with
excitement about the possibilities of language. Yes, teaching poetry IS
difficult. Reading poetry IS difficult. And many students--I don't care
if they're at Harvard or where they come from--are intimidated by the
very thought of studying poetry. It's a great gift you give students
when you equip them with the tools necessary to read a poem.

I'm doing book orders for a "Foundations of Creative Writing" course next
term.  I'm going to have students read some defenses of poetry, but I'm
wondering if there's anything comparable for prose.  Defense of Prose?  Any
good attacks on that genre?
Thanks in advance,

Susan Rothenberg.  (Thank you Steve Clay for this and many other books from
Granary.)

the cause of poetry and poetics here in San Francisco at Small Press
Traffic.  So come on down!

Thanks again . . . Kevin K.

Perhaps tacky to respond to a thread with my name on it the irony that
my name (spelled deliciously wrong) heads a thread on someone elses
didacticism when I, the FEMINIST, with a capital finger pointing at me
would be accused of it and yet I have nothing to do with all of it
though I in fact think my ultimate goals are THOROUGHLY DIDACTIC.  For
example, this from Yaya and Grace:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Yaya and Grace get together to declare:

For now on sexual love will be a matter only between women.  The penis
will be not more than an auto-erotic stand.   Some men when faced with
this new edict will augment their breasts and dress in a manner
customary for women.  Women will accept these men into their couplings
only if they chose to refrain from making what is sublime grotesque.
Use of  the grotesque will be reserved for the naturally exagerated
behavior patterns of those walking alone.  There will be no live
performance of sexual love for those excluded, the video can be
purchased for $10.00.  A registration form will be filled out and a
positive identification number will be recorded.  Be prepared to give us
your mother’s maiden name with the correct spelling and the time, place
and date of her birth.  You will need to provide this information if you
would like to review the results or, your homosexuality.   Rest assured,
all is confidential.


Note:
Currently, no explanation is being offered for the new prohibitions so
please don’t ask.  To do so will cause unseemly physical ailments,
mainly having to do with the hands and the feet.  In particular, fungus
on the nails.  The will grow thick and ridged and yellow, making future
couplings unlikely.

I want to compile a list of contest judges who have awarded prizes to
their students.

It doesn't matter if the judges are mainstream poets or otherwise.

Someone who's very good at rewarding his students for emulation is
Charles Wright.  He's chosen at least two of his former students for book
prizes (one twice).

Heather McHugh has.  Jorie Graham has.

In each case I would like to know the name of the student as well as
the name of the judge, because, as I say, some teachers have done this
many many times.

Would anyone know of others besides Graham, McHugh, Wright?

Instances from previous decades?

Prose is indefensible.  But seriously, I think Sidney and Shelley were
defending not poetry as a genre, or "verse," but poesie in a larger sense;
their defenses (or apologies) apply beyond what we think of as "poetry"
today.

as does Aristotle

on a more recent note, in 1996 Burning Deck published Paul Auster's book,
*Why Write?* which collects seven pieces which might be thought of as
Auster's "defense."

Oct. 11 -- Lee Ann Brown & Shelly Marlowe

Oct. 18 -- Donna Cartelli & Michael Gottlieb

Oct. 25 -- Lisa Lubasch & Max Winter


Zinc Bar is at 90 W. Houston St., readings at 6:30, generally Sundays, $3
donation for readers suggested. One can call 212-366-2091 for other kinds
of details from Douglas Rothschild who maintains the current polarities
along with Brendan "my lungfull is water-proof" Lorber.

About this sunday's reading:

     Jordan Davis is the author of The Economist, Beowulf, Dismembering
Derrida, The London Review of Books, Upstairs, Pome on a Train, & other
volumes. He is a figment of the local & national consciousness, spackles,
& represents the finer side of the human dilemma.

     Lytle Shaw recently transplanted himself. He is an Idiom hero who
places poetics squarely in the jaws of the beast. He fills speech
balloons during the summer & does not regret the San Francisco. He will
cause you to think about the nature of your engagement.

 Still here at Naropa, I have to say that Rachel's work is very different from
most of what goes on here. Rachel arrived at Naropa with her
wild-funny-thoughtfulness and took it with her when she left. Would that there
were a little more of it still around. But I'll take advice from her any day.

Re. this idea of schools, I think a good school would be one that didn't produce
writers identifiable with that particular school. Otherwise, it's more like a
machine.

Cranking out Naropa poetry,

Jonathan Mayhew's Writing Experiments (with apologies to Bernadette
Mayers)

1.  Make a list of writing experiments.

2.  Write a poem in which you include some reference, explicit or
implicit, to everyone you know who has committed suicide.

3.  Write poems designed for a particular magazine (a la Jack Spicer),
even if this magazine doesn't publish poetry.  Send the poems to the
magazine as you write them until they either publish you are tell you to
stop.

4. If you are an academic, give an academic paper composed entirely of
heroic couplets.  Don't tell anyone what you are doing.

5.  "Ghost-write" poems for politicians or celebrities.

6.  Write non-stop for 6 months, in every waking hour not devoted to any
other necessary activity.

7.  Compose a poem employing as many metaphors or example as possible
derived from Wittgenstein's  _Philosophical Investigations_.

8.  Read only poetry written before 1800 for a year.  See if your writing
has changed.
If it has changed for the better do the same with 1700.

9.  Take a book of poetry by someone else and compose poetic responses to
every single poem.  Try this with a poet you hate and then with a poet you
love.  Try writing your poems directly in the book, if you can stand to
deface it.

10.  Invent "heteronimos" a la Pessoa.

Subject:      Re: Teachers Awarding Students Prizes

i know list had a discussion on this about a year or so ago.

personally i think such behavior dishonest and offensive.  if a teacher of
mine were judging a contest, i simply would not submit.  if i submitted
before i knew they were judging, i might either write to disqualify
myself, or perhaps contact teacher and tell them not to read my submission.
if all that failed, and i won, i would not feel very good about it.

i know anthony hecht recommended james merril for award (nba) one year
he was judging.  and said (perhaps facetiously) in correspondence to e.
bishop that he saw no point in reading other works since none could match
up to merrill's work.  i don't recall if that was a year that merrill won,
but i believe it was.  merrill was friend, rather than student.  i still
got the willies reading that letter.

but i am not convinced contests are the way to go either.  i think ther
is a level of quality in most things such that things can be as good, and
nothing can be better, and few things can be as good.  things can be as
good but good in different ways.  at a certain point, a contest seems
a bit arbitrary.  even, a bit like lotto.

do i enter them -- occasionally.  have i ever won one -- no.  do i think
that is fair -- of course not!  i should win every contest, everywhere,
all the time!  says one part of me.  another says "oh, you really are
not very good as a writer -- you see, proof."  can you see why i have
an ambiguous relationship to contests!

I meant Mayer not "Mayers." This is a lot of fun.  Here are the next 10
experiments:

11.  Compose a "Japanese Poetic Diary"

12.  Write an autobiography, but including only events having to do with
particular "subjects" (cooking, jazz, landlords, shoes).

13.  Write the eleventh "Duino Elegy"

14.  Write a book of poetry in which the letter B never appears.  See if
anyone notices.

15.  Parody your own style.

16.  Stage elaborate contests (sestina contests, memorizing contests,
rhyming contests).

17.  Invent multiple ways of "gambling" on poetry (e.g. on the contests
devised above).

18.  Create a "neo-classical" style that is as regular and normative as
Racine.  The vocabulary should be fairly limited, the syntax limpid, the
versification utterly smooth.  Use this style as your normal mode of
communication as much as you can get away with.

19.  Try to get non-poets to collaborate with you on grandiose poetic
projects.  Test your persuasive powers.

20.  Convince famous painters to illustrate your work or paint your
portrait, or composers to set your poems to music.

Both this list and CAP-L discussed this subject at great length last year,
but I think Graham was the only judge explicitly mentioned. I do remember a
controversy a few years ago involving Maxine Kumin -- she had apparently
chosen a ms. by a personal friend in an "open" competition, a choice which
she adamantly defended in a letter to _Poets & Writers_, I believe, on the
grounds that to her it was plainly the best entry. In the early years of
the National Poetry Series, four books were annointed outright by judges
who solicited mss. from friends and students -- nothing hidden about this
-- and only the fifth came out of a slush pile. Now supposedly all five are
the results of "open" competition.  I see nothing morally wrong with poets
helping to advance their students and friends by making phone calls,
writing supportive letters to publishers, etc. Frankly, that's probably how
90% of poetry books -- or any books -- get published. The crime comes
where you have 600-1000 folks naively sending in $25 checks on the
assumption that their ms. will be read and evaluated blindly, without
regard to who wrote it. I think that if any press or organization
sponsoring an "open" contest in which the judge picks a personal friend or
student gets caught (even if they weren't aware of the judge's dubious
action at the time), they should publish the book at their own expense and
refund the entry fees to the contestants. Otherwise it's a blatant
violation of trust.

Just curious, Gabriel... are you planning to write an expose? I think it
would be terrific if you did. What the hell -- it's the Age of Lewinsky.

1). Thank you for your response, Eliza

2). Yes, expanding the list to friends might be useful.  So,

3). Has anyone knowledge of judges choosing _friends_ as well as students?

4). Yupola: Nepotism and the arbitrary certainly are the name of the game.
But since it's difficult to gauge the former, I'd like to grock the
latter.

4.5). Am cynical about none of this: it's just sort of interesting in a
boring kind of way.

5). I'm not being reform-minded, and my interest in this certainly isn't
original, but I'd simply someday like to see a history -- or at least a
list -- of who chose whom for many of these thingies.

6). Of our subscribers, for instance, how many have chosen their own
students or friends?  Of our subscribers, how many have been chosen by
friends or teachers?

7). Not interested in editorial choices for magazine publication:  that's
a different matter and is small potatoes, and happens too often to be
considered scandalous.  But book publication is a little more
interesting, isn't it.

8). I sometimes dress-up like Else von Freytag-Loringhoven.

Thank you, Fred.  Though it's as you say the age of Lewinsky I don't
imagine I'll write an expose.

But I wouldn't mind however if any history I might come to write about this
problem eventually won me an internship in the White House.

I'll dip into the archive here if I can recall how to do that and read
about Graham and the others.  Thanks.  Gabe

Here's a brief rundown on the backscratch history:

1. Homer chose Virgil in an Epic contest even though he was his ephebe.

2. Walt Whitman was named "Poet of the year" in New Jersey by Edgar Allan Poe
who was serving as manager of the Hoboken Blues ball team that year. Walt
had been manager the previous year. That tells you something.

3. Emily Dickinson saw her future 20th-century publication history in a
dream in July, 1863 (the battle of Gettysburg was going on at the
same time).  She mentioned it to her brother but never publicly
acknowledged having a "spin strategy" for canonization.

4. Galway Kinnell awarded himself an award in a contest while wearing
a "Galway Kinnell" t-shirt while visiting Ireland in the summer of 1987.

5. Henry Gould tried to find a friend to award the 1st Annual Nedge
Nudge-to-Fame Contest but was unable to come up with one.

I could go on endlessly - shows you the extent of something!

there was a motion to award the award to george bowering instead, but spandrift
said if henry wouldn't take it, he should get it himself.  it got ugly, and
last i heard, nedge was discontinuing contest.

What about all the poets who actually went to San Francisco
State--though you'd never know it? During the reign of Frances Mayes
(oops! did I say that in public?) the department did its best to hide
its most interesting alumni. That's changing, however.
Some hints: Robert Gluck, Mary Margaret Sloan

Art is propaganda--anyways--

but a more practical approach would be to start by asking the students
to "define" what a poem is or might be--

that would lead you into the realm they exist in and see where you can
make additions. Teach a text such as "Poetics of New American Poetry"
--tho a dated text--worked wonderfully with my senior level art students
one year. Ashbury, Olson, (KINGFISHERS!) etc. The idea is that since you
are teaching--it IS proganda--and give yrself the evirons to know that!

ps: The Objectivists and critical work on them would NOT be out of the
realm and would NOT offend Ms Vendler--either.
