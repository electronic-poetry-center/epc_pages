Hi all,

We've switched hosts here at boogcity.com, and in doing so I
discovered that we never put up this great Boog Reader pamphlet by
Mariana Ruiz. So here's the ink to Mariana's pamphlet, and below this
note are the links to the others that are online.

BR3: For Kurt on His 37th Birthday
At 2:06 a.m. on Feb. 17, 2004 I emailed 51 poets asking them for
Nirvana acrostics by 3 p.m. that same day, three days before what
would have been Kurt Cobain's 37th birthday and a live performance of
Nirvana's In Utero Boog was putting on. These 13 writers met the call:

Todd Colby, Sean Cole, Shanna Compton, Jordan Davis, Erica Kaufman,
Aaron Kiely, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Tony Rubin, Alan Semerdjian,
Jill Stengel, Edwin Torres, Dana Ward, Ian Wilder, and Stephanie Young.

Dear Friends,

We are delighted to announce the release of Brenda Iijima's chapbook *Falling
Blooming Rising Blooming. *

It is available at http://deletepress.org

Brenda has described the project as "a lyrical confrontation with the
mediated experiences of contemporaneity governed by capital affecting the
body-biome epigenetically and penetrating subcutaneously."

The book is a hardback, 32 page machine that has been fully letterpress
printed on a Vandercook in an edition of 100 (75 of which are for sale). It
includes original art collages and handmade cotton/abaca endsheets dyed
with a combination of persimmon, iron oxide, and a concoction of pulverized
willow charcoal and bituminous coal mixed with handmade walnut ink.

Please support her brilliant writing.

As always, in arms,

Crane Giamo
Jared Schickling

Beard of Bees is happy to give to you a new chapbook from Alexandra Mattraw

http://www.beardofbees.com/mattraw.html

from "Mystique":

Lies become irises starred skyward.  Their faces

lit tapers.  Like bread, opposed to facts.  Reams of

blue and gold dissolve, await consumption.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

*CFP for Upcoming Issue of postmedieval=97
Contemporary Poetics and the Medieval Muse*



In a recent article, Chris Jones provides a survey of what he calls =93an
important new development in modern poetry,=94 namely the increasingly larg=
e
and diverse =93range of modern writers who drew on Old English sources in
their work,=94 performing a return to and recovery of early medieval forms
and plots. The foremost characteristic of this =93New Old English=94 was th=
e
=93sustained deployment of Old English tropes and techniques=94 and =93the
rhythmical possibilities for composition=94 offered by early medieval poetr=
y.



One of the aims of this issue is to build on Jones=92 work, and extend the
conversation to more overtly experimental and postmodern poets who work
with the medieval in a variety of ways. What kind of work is being done now
*beyond* English (Old, Middle, etc.)? How does this work push beyond the
tendency of translators to, on the one hand, preserve an archaic medieval
=93feel,=94 while on the other, smooth the material out for contemporary
readers? Furthermore=97and this is the second and more important set of
questions that we wish to explore in this issue=97what would a poetics look
like that, instead of limiting itself to reaching into the medieval for
content and form, explored medieval modes of authorship, subject position,
voice, gender, genre, etc.? How could a poetics critically engage with the
medieval through creativity itself, rendering both breaks and continuities
between contemporary and medieval poetry in terms of language, lines, and
utterance, rather than relying on traditional academic discourse?



Some of the projects we=92ve been excited about in discussing this issue
include *Thomas Meyer*=92s *Beowulf* (Punctum, 2012); *Caroline
Bergvall*=92s *Meddle
English* (Nightboat, 2010); *Julian T. Brolaski*=92s *gowanus
atropolis*(Ugly Duckling, 2011); and
*Pattie McCarthy*=92s *bk of (h)rs* (Apogee, 2002). All of these texts
partake of medieval sources and/or modes of authorship in order to explore
poetry as, respectively, a visual medium, gendered language, language
slippage and loss, linguistic/sexual hierarchies, and so on. In other
words, they do not attempt to update the medieval=97they trouble contempora=
ry
poetics and language through the medieval, and vice-versa. What they
produce is new, but, it seems to us, newness is not the point so much as
disrupting received language systems in order to see what happens, what
understanding of language and poetry can be discovered.



This issue of *postmedieval* will explore such poets and poetry with these
questions, and modes of engagement, firmly in mind. We anticipate a
collection that examines not only the ways that medieval literature informs
and influences the work of such poets as those mentioned above, but how
such work can provide an intriguing lens for considering medieval
literature itself, and how certain medieval modes of writing and authorship
anticipate strains of the contemporary avant-garde. If you are unsure if
your essay is appropriate for this issue, please provide an abstract as
soon as possible, and the editors will respond. In general, essays will be
no longer than 2,500-3,000 words, and the deadline for initial drafts is
October 15, 2013. The issue will be published in 2015.

Greetings!

I just wanted to let you all know that a band that I front (The Minor
Arcana=97http://www.minor-arcana.com) are running a Pledge Music campaign a=
nd
that we are donating 40% of our proceeds above and beyond our goal to the
Poetry Project. The deal is there are 11 days left in the campaign and we
are halfway there. If we are fully funded in 11 days (roughly $2,000 to go)
then Pledge Music will keep the funding open until March 2014 and as people
continue to Pledge, 40% of all of that money goes to the Poetry Project. If
we are not 100% funded in 11 days, then my band gets no money and neither
does the Poetry Project. You can help fund the project here:
http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/minorarcanarecord2

Pledge Music is like a Kickstarter but just for musicians, curated, and
with more accountability. 25% of the money is withheld from us until we
complete the album and upload it to their servers AND everyone confirms
they received their promised exclusive. Cards are not charged until we are
fully funded and if we fail to meet the terms and conditions which Pledge
Music monitors, refunds are guaranteed. In other words, we can't scam
anyone.

The campaign is trying to raise a little less than half the money necessary
for us to record our second album. The album is about personal and
political turmoil (specifically the death of my close friend and ex-fiancee
and the Occupy Movement, by and large) but includes a songs which are
tributes to Celan, reimagine/recontextualize Wallace Stevens and William
Carlos Williams, appropriate Andrew Joron and Rimbaud, but do it in the
context of post-punk meeting art rock. I wrote all of the lyrics and music.

Some of the exclusives include broadsides/chapbooks by myself and other
poets: Sarah Heady, Greg Bem, Amy Silbergeld, & Carlos Soto Roman. There
are also exclusives that include exclusive posters, exclusive packaging for
CDs which will ONLY be available to pledgers and will include broadsides of
the lyrics (which you can preview at the campaign's site), or if you have
your own band or musical project or recording needs, a full 8 hour day of
tracking at Philadelphia's Turtle Studios (www.turtlestudios.com) OR an
entire full-length record mastered by them, or I or my band will travel
anywhere within a reasonable distance (say 5 hours-ish of Philly) to play
an event/party=97there's a lot of weird, quirky packages available.

It's important, however, that we first meet this funding goal in the next
11 days, or else the campaign cannot raise funds for the Poetry Project, so
your help is important now. Crowd funding isn't about how much you value an
artist after all=97it's about how much small DIY bands/artists and groups
like the Poetry Project value you. It's our demonstrative admission that we
cannot do what we do without support from our community of colleagues,
peers, and fans.

Thanks for reading this and for all of your consideration.

Best,

Matthew Landis

Greetings!

I just wanted to let you all know that a band that I front (The Minor
Arcana=97http://www.minor-arcana.com) are running a Pledge Music campaign a=
nd
that we are donating 40% of our proceeds above and beyond our goal to the
Poetry Project. The deal is there are 11 days left in the campaign and we
are halfway there. If we are fully funded in 11 days (roughly $2,000 to go)
then Pledge Music will keep the funding open until March 2014 and as people
continue to Pledge, 40% of all of that money goes to the Poetry Project. If
we are not 100% funded in 11 days, then my band gets no money and neither
does the Poetry Project. *You can fund the project here: *
http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/minorarcanarecord2

Pledge Music is like a Kickstarter but just for musicians, curated, and
with more accountability. 25% of the money is withheld from us until we
complete the album and upload it to their servers AND everyone confirms
they received their promised exclusive. Cards are not charged until we are
fully funded and if we fail to meet the terms and conditions which Pledge
Music monitors, refunds are guaranteed. In other words, we can't scam
anyone.

The campaign is trying to raise a little less than half the money necessary
for us to record our second album. The album is about personal and
political turmoil (specifically the death of my close friend and ex-fiancee
and the Occupy Movement, by and large) but includes a songs which are
tributes to Celan, reimagine/recontextualize Wallace Stevens and William
Carlos Williams, appropriate Andrew Joron and Rimbaud, but do it in the
context of post-punk meeting art rock. I wrote all of the lyrics and music.

Some of the exclusives include broadsides/chapbooks by myself and other
poets: Sarah Heady, Greg Bem, Amy Silbergeld, & Carlos Soto Roman. There
are also exclusives that include exclusive posters, exclusive packaging for
CDs which will ONLY be available to pledgers and will include broadsides of
the lyrics (which you can preview at the campaign's site), or if you have
your own band or musical project or recording needs, a full 8 hour day of
tracking at Philadelphia's Turtle Studios (www.turtlestudios.com) OR an
entire full-length record mastered by them, or I or my band will travel
anywhere within a reasonable distance (say 5 hours-ish of Philly) to play
an event/party=97there's a lot of weird, quirky packages available.

It's important, however, that we first meet this funding goal in the next
11 days, or else the campaign cannot raise funds for the Poetry Project, so
your help is important now. Crowd funding isn't about how much you value an
artist after all=97it's about how much small DIY bands/artists and groups
like the Poetry Project value you. It's our demonstrative admission that we
cannot do what we do without support from our community of colleagues,
peers, and fans.

Thanks for reading this and for all of your consideration.

Best,

Matthew Landis

Announcing a new, co-published title
from Scary Topiary & Katalanché presses

GEORGIA by Andrew Zawacki

A long poem in the myriad traditions of Philippe Soupault, Charles
Olson, Carson McCullers, Jacques Derrida, et al., GEORGIA is a bereaved
"insomiateque"--part incantation, part invective, part lullaby.

Saddle-stitched binding and silk-screened covers. Art by Grace Tran.
Edition of 166. $10, ppd.

ALSO, I'm excited to announce the long overdue digital version of the
very rare, first ever Scary Topiary chapbook: ARTHUR ECHO by CAConrad &
Thom Donovan, which vanished quickly in its original run of 88 print
copies. This title is now available in a free, pdf form.

Find both chapbooks & others at:

What I've been doing -


New ESP-Disk vinyl and cd forthcoming!

We've been busy recording and mastering; the recording was made
at GodelStrings on Saturday, the mastering on laptops.

The lineup and instrumentation -

Azure Carter, lots of songs!
Chris Diasparra, baritone and tenor saxes!
Ed Schneider, alto sax, a bit of singing!
Alan Sondheim, long-necked saz, cura, cura cumbus, electric saz,
viola, violin, tro, oud, classical guitar, parlor guitar, dan
moi, kouxian, ukulele, sarangi, suroz, ghichek, pipa, sung lisu,
flute, chromatic harmonica, Cm harmonic harmonica!

(I wanted to see what the transitions would be like, from one
instrument or mode of playing to another; I also wanted to try
using an extreme number of instruments during the course of a
9-hour recording session.)

The sound recording is amazing - I really recommend this studio.

-- Also, working on a series of texts on IMMORTALITY for the
upcoming Subtle Technologies gathering/conference in Toronto
this weekend, yay!

-- And query - just found a Korean gayageum at a thrift store;
it's quite old and needs some work - if you know anything about
stringing it please get in touch! Thanks -

Also in Ezra, my translation of Enclosed Garden by Emilio Prados is
featured. Prados, a major figure in the Generation of 1927, along with =
his
close associates Lorca, Aleixandre, Cernuda, Guill=E9n, spent his years =
of
exile after the Spanish Civil War in Mexico City. His poetry configures =
the
body as a garden and the garden as a lover in a maddening concatenation =
of
the contained within the contained, walls within walls opening on the =
limits
of existence. Enclosed Garden, 380 pages is available from Lavender Ink =
/
Di=E1logos. This is the first substantive translation of work by Prados
(1899-1962) into English.
http://www.lavenderink.org/content/link-titles/152. A wonderful review =
of
this edition has been published by Lucina Schell at

Subject:      Crowd Funding Campaign Donating Portion of $ to Poetry Project
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Greetings!

I just wanted to let you all know that a band that I front (The Minor
Arcana=97http://www.minor-arcana.com) are running a Pledge Music campaign a=
nd
that we are donating 40% of our proceeds above and beyond our goal to the
Poetry Project. The deal is there are 11 days left in the campaign and we
are halfway there. If we are fully funded in 11 days (roughly $2,000 to go)
then Pledge Music will keep the funding open until March 2014 and as people
continue to Pledge, 40% of all of that money goes to the Poetry Project. If
we are not 100% funded in 11 days, then my band gets no money and neither
does the Poetry Project.

Pledge Music is like a Kickstarter but just for musicians, curated, and
with more accountability. 25% of the money is withheld from us until we
complete the album and upload it to their servers AND everyone confirms
they received their promised exclusive. Cards are not charged until we are
fully funded and if we fail to meet the terms and conditions which Pledge
Music monitors, refunds are guaranteed. In other words, we can't scam
anyone.

The campaign is trying to raise a little less than half the money necessary
for us to record our second album. The album is about personal and
political turmoil (specifically the death of my close friend and ex-fiancee
and the Occupy Movement, by and large) but includes a songs which are
tributes to Celan, reimagine/recontextualize Wallace Stevens and William
Carlos Williams, appropriate Andrew Joron and Rimbaud, but do it in the
context of post-punk meeting art rock. I wrote all of the lyrics and music.

Some of the exclusives include broadsides/chapbooks by myself and other
poets: Sarah Heady, Greg Bem, Amy Silbergeld, & Carlos Soto Roman. There
are also exclusives that include exclusive posters, exclusive packaging for
CDs which will ONLY be available to pledgers and will include broadsides of
the lyrics (which you can preview at the campaign's site), or if you have
your own band or musical project or recording needs, a full 8 hour day of
tracking at Philadelphia's Turtle Studios (www.turtlestudios.com) OR an
entire full-length record mastered by them, or I or my band will travel
anywhere within a reasonable distance (say 5 hours-ish of Philly) to play
an event/party=97there's a lot of weird, quirky packages available.

It's important, however, that we first meet this funding goal in the next
11 days, or else the campaign cannot raise funds for the Poetry Project, so
your help is important now. Crowd funding isn't about how much you value an
artist after all=97it's about how much small DIY bands/artists and groups
like the Poetry Project value you. It's our demonstrative admission that we
cannot do what we do without support from our community of colleagues,
peers, and fans.

Thanks for reading this and for all of your consideration.

Best,

Matthew Landis

Hi folks

I'm really pleased to get your messages but I'm finding the self promotion o=
f your writers is becoming wearisome

Not a big problem I suppose but I'm not sure that it's really true to the sp=
irit of poetry

Best

backward pilgrim by Deborah Akers / I-Beam Books, 2013

http://i-beambooks.com/backwardpilgrim/index.html
=20
=93In poems pulsing with the dense, rich music of partial rhyme,=20
Deborah Akers brings us her arresting vision of the Colorado Rockies, a =
landscape where
 =93... ten thousand feet / raises the stakes / to biblical =
proportions...,=94=20
where =93eons of crushed lives / crowd into / swaths of sandstone...=94
=46rom kyrie to benedictus, Akers sings the songs of a pilgrim come to =
the mountain.=20
On these pages she invokes what might be lost, if not for the power of =
her poems to reclaim it.=94
=97Paulann Peterson, Oregon Poet Laureate

The seemingly unavoidable human impulse to seek comfort and reassurance =
in taxonomy means that providing labels might be the best way to =
introduce Deborah Akers and her new book of poems, backward pilgrim. =
Akers was born and raised in Colorado, schooled in Washington and =
Oregon, and lived for several years in California, before returning to =
Oregon (specifically, Portland) to work and write. So, Akers can safely =
be included in the category, Western poet. Her poems throb with an =
abundance of images derived from the flora, fauna, geology, and =
geography of her home state, thus making her a Nature poet, as well. =
Many of her poems recall her childhood and invoke family scenes, so =
calling her an Autobiographical poet would not be a mistake, though =
there is a reserve in Akers=92 recollections that preclude adding a =
label so raw as Confessional. While her poems abound with internal =
rhyme, half-rhyme, and assonance, Akers does not employ any recognizable =
conventional forms (though she frequently uses strophes of equal length =
in many of her poems), so the designation Free Verse poet is apropos, =
with the Objectivist poet Lorine Niedecker being someone in particular =
with whom Akers can be favorably compared. Then there is the matter of =
the religious imagery that provides spiritual seasoning for so many of =
Akers=92 poems. Akers was raised a Protestant, but one sequence of poems =
references a Catholic requiem, and allusions to Buddhism also appear. In =
virtually every Akers poem, if the divine is not encountered directly, =
it is almost surely lurking somewhere in the background and is providing =
some of the impulse for what is being written. However you finally =
classify these poems, all of them reverberate with the beauty of what is =
seen, what is heard, what is said. Often, it is a spare beauty, =
austerely recorded, but it is undeniable. Finally, backward pilgrim is =
Akers=92 first collection of poetry, which should be seen as a =
recommendation in and of itself. A first book resembles a =93Selected =
Poems=94 in that a first book can be a gathering of an author=92s best =
work to date. First collections have the advantage of no boundaries: =
every poem the author has ever written can be considered; only unwritten =
poems are unavailable. The author has the luxury of being ruthless, =
tossing aside the merely good and the just adequate, while holding out =
for the best. Akers=92 pilgrimage through years of poems has resulted in =
a book that provides not only a lovely, detailed map of territories both =
physical, emotional, and spiritual, but meditations on the journeys =
possible when one opens oneself to the mysteries the world has to offer.

Dear friends,

Hope to see you this Thursday, June 13th for a reading in solidarity with
NYC grand jury resistor Jerry Koch, featuring:

*Lonely Christopher
*Diana Hamilton
*Sophia Le Fraga
*Ariana Reines
*Joshua Furst
*John Coletti

*and more!

We'll be raising money for the legal and support fund of NYC grand jury
resistor, Jerry Koch. A longtime anarchist and legal activist, Jerry was
recently subpoenaed as a witness by a federal grand jury, and has refused
to testify. As a result, he's been sentenced to up to 18 months in jail,
with a possibility that the sentence can be renewed, which he began serving
two weeks ago--despite not being charged with any crime, and invoking his
First and Fifth Amendment rights.

There's a long history of federal grand juries being used to persecute
political activists, and it's a trend that has increased in recent years,
so we hope you can come out to show solidarity with Jerry. We'll be taking
donations, and there will be beer and wine for sale, with all proceeds
going to Jerry's support campaign.

Even if you can't make it out to the reading, please take a look at the
Jerry Resists support campaign website,
http://jerryresists.net/category/news/, and consider making a small
donation and/or writing a letter.

All best,
Aaron and Josef

*Details:
7PM
138 Manhattan Avenue, #3
Brooklyn, NY 11206*

Subject:      New from AngelHousePress - Four Hundred Rabbits by Steven Artelle

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8; format=flowed

Steven Artelle's long poem "Four Hundred Rabbits" is simultaneously
imaginative & philosophical. There are red rabbits, shy rabbits, rabbits
into soft core porn, rabbits with foot fetishes, filthy creatures who
become deities of dust, robot rabbits, masked rabbits. Above all "Four
Hundred Rabbits" has a poignant lyricism with descriptions which bring
to mind Albrecht DÅ±rer's Apocalypse & William Blake's illuminated books.
This work is full of energy, heat, humour & creativity. If John Updike,
Dante Alighieri & Lewis Carroll were to have a love child, his name
would be Steven Artelle.

"one rabbit cried/our divinity was nothing without the cities/the cities
with their night fires and their cavernous days/and praise and praise
and praise was the pulse of our dancing"

Limited Edition of 50 copies.
ISBN: 97819267860302
Price: $5.00 CAD

available at AngelHousePress.com

Steven will be launching "Four Hundred Rabbits" on Friday, June 14, 2013
as part of the Ottawa Small Press Book Fair Pre-Fair Reading in Ottawa
at 7:30pm, the Carleton Tavern, 223 Armstrong, UPSTAIRS.

copies will be also be available at the fair at the Jack Purcell Centre
on Saturday, June 15 at the AngelHousePress table along with remaining
copies of chapbooks by Ben Ladouceur, Christine McNair, Catherine Owen
plus ephemera from Le Temps des Cerise.

yr fallen angel,
Amanda Earl

My great friend Andrea Baker just had the first installment of her "Famous
Rapes" series published at the Rumpus. This installment of visual poetry
reenacts "Master Paintings" that include rape through packing tape. This is
one of the best feminist projects I've seen in years!

Hi,

The online pdf of Boog City 81, with a special section of work on =20
Oakland, Calif., is now available. You can read it at:

http://boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc81.pdf

And, for the first time ever, everything's hyperlinked in the issue.

And two important Boog things to note:

You'll see on pages 2-3 the list of all that's going on at the 7th =20
annual Welcome to Boog City Festival where, for the first time, we've =20=

surpassed 100 performers. If you want to view the flyer separately and =20=

share with others:

http://boogcity.com/flyer.wbc7.pdf

(thanks to our art editor, the incomparable Jonathan Allen =
(http://www.jonathanallen.org/=20
), for the festival logo.)

************************************************************************

And, as part of the fest, we're hard at work on raising funds to bring =20=

NYC expat Matt Roth, Major Matt Mason USA, in to witness the =20
performance, for its 15th anniversary, of his classic Me Me Me album, =20=

to play the final song of the record and then a set of post-Me Me Me  =20=

solo work.

We've raised $309, and need to raise $191 in 10 days, on or by Sun. =20
June 30, to be able to get Matt to town. The ad for the Matt =20
fundraising is on p.2 of the paper. if you want to view it separately =20=

and share with others:

And to paypal donations of any amount, send funds to =20

Thanks for your continued support.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

Introducing a new poetry release by Ivy Johnson, recent graduate of Mills=
=20
College MFA Poetry program, published by Timeless Infinite Light of Oakla=
nd,=20
CA.

In "As They Fall" various syntagmas - words, phrases, sentences  - are pr=
inted=20
in handwriting on 3" x 4.25" cards.  The poem(s) can thus be arranged in =
any=20
variety of order by the builder/reader of the poem, a methodology recalli=
ng=20
works such as Robert Greiner's "Sentences."  Each card is beautifully pri=
nted=20
with a starry design and is unique in its own cloudy wash of pale salmon =
pink.=20

"As They Fall" creates a mythic economy of language based in contingency=20=

rather than declaration.  Pulling from my own pile of cards randomly I re=
ad,=20
"now I am hungry / put your mouth on me oh god / the warbling poles / the=
=20
wind planted seeds / is this not baptism / throbs w/ a flash / florescent=
 lights /=20
turn, then".  Alternatively, I am invited to construct my own poem, invit=
ed to=20
navigate of the total space that is the whole of the poem's language and =
to=20
"try out" its economy of movement and imagery for myself.  For example: "=
As=20
in a mirror / the handprints / random flat vibrations / sometimes a figur=
e /=20
build in me / as if returning were possible / the sun was pure / a scene =
/ a=20
flood behind it".

Hello Again,

In a little over five weeks, to mark our 22nd anniversary, we'll be
putting on our seventh annual Welcome to Boog City poetry, music, and
theater festival, featuring poets, musicians, and playwrights
performing at two venues, in two boroughs, over four days, from Fri.
Aug. 2-Mon. Aug. 5. To see the full schedule of over 100 poetry,
music, and theater peformances visit:

http://boogcity.com/flyer.wbc7.pdf

Ten days before the event, we'll be putting out the festival issue of
Boog City. This issue will feature pieces on some of the performers
and a full schedule, illustrated with images of each of the
performers. Here's what last year's looked like:

http://www.boogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc72.pdf

Advertising in the festival issue of Boog City means you will reach
more than 3,000 readers, poetry lovers, and small press aficionados
throughout the East Village, other targeted areas of lower Manhattan;
Williamsburg and Greenpoint, Brooklyn; as well as online distribution
on our boogcity.com website. That's an increase of 33.3% over our
regular issues for no additional cost. And, since this issue is also a
program for the festival, readers will give it a closer read as they
check to see who's up later on that day and throughout the festival.

Boog City continues to offer our special Small Press Ad Rates. That
means when you advertise with us you will save 50% off of our regular
display ad rates.

      * Full Page        $250
      * Half-Page       $130
      * Quarter-Page   $70
      * Eighth-Page     $40

Here is a link to our full rate card:

http://boogcity.com/adrates.pdf

As I mentioned in previous emails to you, Boog City focuses on getting
the word out about lesser-known artists, be they poets, prose writers,
musicians, painters, photographers, or cartoonists. Eight times a year
we publish poetry from the likes of Anselm Berrigan, Renee Gladman,
Lisa Jarnot, Eileen Myles, Kristin Prevallet, and recent Pulitzer
Prize winnr Tracy K. Smith, alongside our music section, small press
book reviews, political commentary, art, comics, and photographs.

We look forward to working with you to bring your message to the local
arts community to increase awareness and sales of your publications in
the New York area.

as ever,
David

Free event at Campos Plaza Housing Development? =

featuring Cooper-Moore, Rob Brown, Darius Jones, Roy Campbell Max Johnso=
n, Chad Taylor + children of Music is Mine

For 3 years, Arts For Art has run a free music program 'Music Is Mine' f=
or the children in Campos Plaza housing development - 611 East 13 Street=
. =

The primary teachers have been William Parker and Jean Carla Rodea with =
help from other musicians.
Last Tuesday when musicians who were to perform for and with the Music I=
s Mine students arrived for the final class of the year, the children we=
re being driven away on a 'field trip' And -Our teachers were informed t=
hat NYCHA will be closing the center in September.
Later we heard that all of the NYCHA children, senior & health centers w=
ould close because of the loss of federal funding, due to the sequester =
budget cuts. Now it seems that people are rising to Save these centers. =
 Hopefully our event will bring much needed attention to these important=
 programs. =

let me know if you can help.
GOLES will send a representative and Councilwoman Rosie Mendez will be s=
peaking =

and I am very sorry for the late notice!
thank you
