If so, I would appreciate it if you could e-mail it to me.

Reading and writing about Zukofsky's "A" of late, I'm puzzled by a passage in
"A"-8: "SOCONY will not always sign off on this air" (p. 63, UCP ed).

Can anyone identify "SOCONY?"  The line evokes a radio station-identification
for me. Could it be a station nick-named "Soco" in New York?

The press release below was written as only law firms could write one.
However, the website -- www.uncoversettlement.com -- has a lot more
information. It includes a database that will enable you to see if you are
among the thousands of writers whose work was being sold without permission
over the net.

Please note that there are deadlines!

Feel free to distribute to writer's lists, etc.

And pardon the cross posting.

Freelance Authors Regain Copyright Control Through Innovative Settlement

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., July 26

Document Provider to Obtain Permission Before Selling Authors' Articles
Electronically

Historic Legal Settlement Includes Class Notification to Authors

The settlement, believed to be the first class action lawsuit of its kind in
the nation, instructs commercial document delivery services to obtain
permission from authors before their creative works can be sold
electronically via the Internet. The case involved a group of individual
authors who challenged UnCover, an online document delivery service that
sold copyrighted magazine and journal articles over the Internet without the
author's permission. UnCover pursued royalty contracts with many periodical
publishers and paid copyright fees to publishers, but not to individual
authors.

The $7.25 million settlement, preliminarily approved by the federal court in
Oakland, California, requires UnCover to expand its copyright permission and
royalty payment system to include individual authors as well as publishers,
and to obtain certain specified forms of permission before delivery of such
articles. UnCover will now also offer a licensing agreement with any author
who requests it, paying royalties semi-annually. The settlement fund will
come from other settling parties.

The settlement also uniquely initiates a search for thousands of authors,
poets and other academic and creative writers who may have had their works
sold by UnCover in the past. Any authors who retained their copyright in any
article delivered by UnCover between October 22, 1994 and July 12, 2000 may
be eligible to participate in the settlement. Anyone whose written work has
been published in a magazine or periodical is strongly encouraged to visit
the special Web site ( http://www.uncoversettlement.com ) where a potential
class member can get complete information and submit their claim for a share
of the settlement via the Internet. The Web site will be launched on Monday,
July 31, 2000.

"Selling individual articles electronically without author permission has
been an industry-wide practice. We believe the law does not allow the
practice, and this settlement should go a long way to changing it," said the
authors' attorney John Shuff of the national law firm of Robins, Kaplan,
Miller & Ciresi L.L.P. ( http://www.rkmc.com ), known for its broad
experience in complex litigation. "We hope the industry will take notice and
adopt the same permission procedures as UnCover."

The representative plaintiffs, a group of freelance and academic writers,
and poets, were Joan Ryan, Jim Tunney, Arlie Russell Hochschild, Lyn
Hejinian and Ron Silliman.

"The intellectual property owned by authors is no different than music owned
by songwriters or images owned by photographers," said copyright attorney
Dan Reidy of the Law Offices of Daniel A. Reidy of Sausalito, California,
co-counsel with Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi L.L.P., referring to recent
legal challenges to the electronic downloading and distribution of music and
photos on CDs or via the Internet. "Authors have not only regained control
of their work, but perhaps more importantly, they have regained control of
their value," said Reidy.  UnCover's founder, Ward Shaw, said that UnCover
has long worked with publishers and rights organizations such as the
Copyright Clearance Center and the National Writers Union's Publication
Rights Clearinghouse to pay copyright for delivery of the articles
researchers and others need. "We are happy to work with individual authors
directly as well," said Shaw. UnCover ( http://www.uncweb.carl.org )
maintains a database of approximately eight million articles -- increasing
by approximately 5,000 per day -- from more than 17,000 periodicals, and
specializes in supplying copies of articles from often hard-to-find
scientific, medical and technical journals and other publications.

ACUSTICA International SF2000
It's Sound, It's Art, It's Music
http://arsacustica.net

A two week celebration of SOUND ART brings the boldest, most exciting
artists from Europe and the US to galleries, theaters, and museums
throughout the city. Acoustic art is the melting pot of heterogeneous
elements, noise, language, and music organized by means of electronic
techniques into a new, unique genre. It has been developed in experimental
studios, like the Studio of Acoustic Art of the WDR (West-German
broadcasting station) in Cologne. The focus of ACUSTICA INTERNATIONAL SF
2000 will be on international composers who recorded and composed for this
studio under the direction of Klaus Schoening.

BILL FONTANA
Reception with the artist:
Sept. 7, 6-7pm
Gallery hours: Tue-Sat 10am-6pm
Tel. 415.546-0158
Internationally known for his experimental work in sound, Bill Fontana
shares with the small group of artists who work in the medium an interest in
transforming the aural environment. He is unique, however, in employing
exclusively ambient, rather than electronic, sound. Fontana regards the
physical environment as a living source of musical information, with
aesthetic and evocative qualities that can conjure up visual imagery. For
this show he will install invisible sound pieces with visual surprises.

Tel. 415.626-5416
No other school of art has inspired people's creativity as vigorously as
Futurism, which began in the early 20th century and still gives fresh
impetus to various art forms. Futuressencexxx focuses on provocative plays
from the futurist movement. The original works, read by local artists from a
contemporary point of view, are dramatized through musical compositions by
German artists Gerhard Staebler and Kunsu Shim. The music, which for the
most part has been created at the ZKM, Center for Art and Media Technology
in Karlsruhe, Germany, invites us to hear, see, touch, smell, and pulls us
into the whirlpool of ACUSTICA INTERNATIONAL 2000.

Roberto Fabbriciani: contrabass flute
Nicola Sani: electronics
Tape production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst, 1996, 35 min
Centered on the theme of flowing water, the acoustic material for this

40 min
This complex electro-acoustic composition in the form of a string quartet
transports us into the Elizabethan age. English dancer, actor, writer, and
choreographer Nigel Charnock interprets Shakespeare sonetts in permanent
movement. With clarinet and saxophone, Michael Riessler enters into a
dialogue with the dancer. Fever makes dance audible and conveys danced
poetry to the ear.

INTERMISSION

ALVIN CURRAN
Erat Verbum John
Dedicated to John Cage
Electro-acoustic live concert with Alvin Curran: keyboard
Production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst 2000, 15 min
This etude and portrait of John Cage uses the sounds of his voice, music,
and personal environment in a performance of raw and digitally processed
sounds created directly from a sampler and controller keyboard. A second
computer program distributes the performed structures through an eight
channel sound system.

JOHN CAGE
Roaratorio.
An Irish Circus on Finnegans Wake
Multichannel performance
Voice: John Cage, Singer: Joe Heaney, Fiddle: Paddy Glackin, Bodrhan: Peada

Realisation: John Cage and John David Fullemann, Executive producer: Klaus
Schšning. Multichannel production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst/The Cage
Trust, 1979, 60 min
Karl-Sczuka Prize 1979

With his prize-winning piece, Roaratorio, an Irish Circus on Finnegans Wake,
John Cage composed a key work in the acoustic art of the 20th century.
Drawing on his experience of music, verse, sound poetry, recording montage,
and his close ties to Zen Buddhism, he created an all encompassing cosmogony
of the human voice, the sounds of nature, and the human environment. His
enduring and intensive preoccupation with James Joyce's Finnegans Wake led
to this sound-text of 2500 sounds and quotes from Finnegans Wake, spoken by
John Cage.

RANDY THOM
Ear Circus Number One
Compositon with soundtrack motives
From the film Forrest Gump
Production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst 1995, presented by Randy Thom, 60
min followed by a demonstration of his film soundtracks

"Ear Circus Number One does not have a 'story' in the sense that a Hollywood
film has a story, but it has some of the dynamics of a story. Many of the
sounds suggest certain kinds of locales, and a few of the sounds are being
filtered through the point of view of a character who is possibly going in
and out of a dream, or a series of memories, most of them unpleasant, some
about war. I used some of the sounds that I recorded for the film Forrest
Gump, including the helicopter."        -Randy Thom

NICOLA SANI / MICHELANGELO ANTONIONI
Noto-Mandorli-Vulcano-Stromboli-Carnevale
Film by Michelangelo Antonioni
Music and soundtrack by Nicola Sani
Presented by Nicola Sani
20 min
Nicola Sani presents the musical soundtrack to Antonioni's short poetic
film, images of the sites where he shot his masterwork L'Avventura thirty
years ago. Sani's composition consists of concrete instrumental and
electro-acoustic sound material merging sound and image.

ROBERT CAHEN
Sept visions fugitives / Seven Fleeting Visions
(excerpts)
Camera and realisation: Robert Cahen, acoustic design: Michel Chion, sound

Production: ARTE and Les Films du Tambour de Soie in collaboration with CICV
Presented by Robert Cahen
Grand Prix Europe, International Video Festival Estavar, Spain 1995,
International Video Art Prize, Germany, 1996
Robert Cahen presents sequences of his prize-winning and already legendary
videofilm, Seven Fleeting Visions, which trace the idea of concentrated
meaning within a concentrated aesthetics perhaps reflecting a secret
affinity to the creative process in haiku poetry. Cahen's videos display not
only his own inner world, but also the inner and outer world of an alien
with his gestures and rituals.

INTERMISSION

BILL FONTANA
Acoustical Visions of Venice
(excerpts)
North American Premiere
DVD production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst, 2000
Presented by Bill Fontana
30 min
Acoustical Visions of Venice is one of three unique projects based on a
large collection of multichannel digital recordings Bill Fontana made during
his installation for the Venice Biennale in 1999. The installation placed on
the facade of the Punta della Dogana, the famous 15th century customs house,
explores the idea of hearing as far as you can see with microphones and
transmitters placed in the amazing visual panorama of Venice that surrounds
the Dogana. The idea is to explore the changing space of sonic perception in
the layered sound textures of Venice.

ANTHONY MOORE
Moving Sounds
(excerpts)
DVD production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst, 2000
Presented by Anthony Moore
30 min
Exploring acoustic space with DVD technology, Moving Sounds tries to map the
space of the studio by mechanical means as a volumetric area through which
sounding objects swim. Quietness means distance, loud sounds reflect
closeness, movements to the left or right are actual in a network of
travelling receivers (microphones) and mobile sources. The results of these
experiments are then composed to form a piece about space and shifting sonic
perspectives.

PIERRE HENRY / WALTHER RUTTMANN
La Ville / Die Stadt. Metropolis Paris - Berlin
HoerSpielFilm
with the silent movie
Berlin. Die Sinfonie der Gro§stadt (1927)
by Walther Ruttmann
Production: WDR Studio Akustische Kunst, 1985
Presented by Klaus Schoening
65 min
Klaus Schoening presents this audiovisual project  which combines Pierre
Henry's sound composition, La Ville/Die Stadt/The City, Metropolis
Paris-Berlin with the silent movie, Berlin. Sinfonie einer Grossstadt, by
the German filmpioneer Walther Ruttmann. The composition structured by
numerous acoustic micro-components like a film without pictures is an homage
to Ruttmann's classical silent film, a unique artistic document about Berlin
and the roaring twenties.

SOUNDS OF ALL KINDS
From DADA to NOW
Admission $10 general,
$8 members/students/seniors
Tel. 415.771-7020

TRISTAN TZARA / RICHARD HUELSENBECK / MARCEL JANKO
L'amiral cherche une maison a louer (1916) for three performers
In 1916, artists Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janko, and Richard Huelsenbeck
collaborated on "simultaneous poems," of which "The Admiral looks for a
house to rent" is a daring and amusing example. Three performers speak three
languages (French, German, English) while simultaneously making noises to
create a true Dada experience.

WASSILY KANDINSKY
Klaenge / Sounds (1912)
Poetic texts read in German and English
Around 1912, painter Wassily Kandinsky experimented with texts he called
Klaenge, which deal both directly and indirectly with sounds of all kinds.
They will be presented here in their original German with English
translations, all accompanied by slides of woodcuts he created for the first
published edition of the poems.

KURT SCHWITTERS
Ursonate (1922-32)
Excerpts performed by Konrad Steiner and Charles Boone
Kandinsky's Klaenge and Schwitters sound works and collages from a few years
later are pioneering experiments in what we call nowadays crossover art: art
in genres not normally associated with the artists who created it.

CHARLES AMIRKHANIAN
Son of Metropolis San Francisco (1997)
Tape composition
Composer Charles Amirkhanian will be on hand for the first Bay Area
performance of Son of Metropolis San Francisco. This tape composition is a
highly subjective sound portrait of our city, which avoids the more obvious
tourist's view of this place.

ABIGAIL CHILD
Mercy (1989)
Sound film
The films of Abigail Child, one of America's foremost experimenters in the
medium, invariably feature sonic elements which are as powerful and
provocative as their visual elements.

LAETITIA SONAMI
Conversation with a Lightbulb (2000)
Live computer sound performance with visual elements/faculty installation
World renowned composer/performer Laetitia Sonami is a pioneer in live
computer performance. In concert, she wears a specially designed glove that
is hooked directly into her computer. Through this, the movements of her
fingers, wrist, and arm act as triggers for the vast array of sounds that
emerge from loudspeakers; her movements during the performance provide a
kind of choreographed visual element to the sounds.
The program, co-sponsored by the San Francisco Cinematheque, is organized
and directed by San Francisco Art Institute faculty member Charles Boone

Announcing the publication of: REIMAGINING THE AMERICAN PACIFIC: From South Pacific to Bamboo Ridge and Beyond by Rob Wilson

In this compelling critique Rob Wilson explores the creation of the &#8220;Pacific Rim&#8221; in the American imagination and how the concept has been variously adapted and resisted in Hawai&#8216;i, the Pacific Islands, New Zealand, and Australia. Reimagining the American Pacific ranges from the nineteenth century to the present and draws on theories of postmodernism, transnationality, and post-Marxist geography to contribute to the ongoing discussion of what constitutes &#8220;global&#8221; and &#8220;local.&#8221; Reimagining the American Pacific is an engaging and provocative contribution to the fields of Asian and American studies, as well as those of cultural studies and theory, literary criticism, and popular criticism.

Early Praise for Reimagining the American Pacific
&#8220;At ease with the interface of the local and global, Rob Wilson flies in and out of Asia and the Pacific. As he rediscovers and redefines the continent, islands and waters, he constantly rereads America. Such a geographic venture is also an exercise in de-disciplining.  Circulating freely among literature, culture, economics, politics, history, and media, Wilson&#8217;s imagination and judgment are shrewd, sardonic, zestful, zany, and delightful.  Reimagining the American Pacific is a thoroughly rewarding book.&#8221;&#8212;Masao Miyoshi, University of California, San Diego

Listers:

Does anyone out there
close watching the convention
find it so far best described
as something between
Coleridge's "willing suspension
of disbelief" and Keat's
opaque "negative capability" ?

Watching the Philadelphia Big Top
seems to beg me to judge
its reality...while asserting its reality.

Democracy, instead
of disappearing, merely
surrendered its truth claims,
turing itself into a comforting
poetry on one hand or
an empty moralizing
on the other.

Bst,
Gerald

Thanks to all who helped in the unravelling. Would there were prizes
available to show virtual thanks.

"A"-8's SOCONY stands for Standard Oil Company of New York, which did
business in the northeast from the 1930s through the mid-sixties. A 1927
roadmap captures the spirit with a cover image of NY state renamed
"SOCONYLAND."

Taken in context,  "SOCONY will not always sign off on this air." ("A"-8
61-63) is probably a play on a (real/fictive) radio sign-off for the sponsor.
Thus it rhymes with Gill Scott Heron's "The revolution will not be televised"
-- as well as "A"-8's ironic:

"New York, N.Y.
Editor, Times Union:
I would die for dear old Standard Oil
Ex-Soldier,
12:47 P.M"

Thanks again all,
KS

 But the labor process
       Consider the labor process apart
       From its particular form under particular
       social conditions
       What distinguishes any worker from the best
       of the bees
       Is that the worker builds a cell in his head
       before he constructs it in wax.
. . .
       By the green waters oil
       The air circles the wild flower; the men
       Skirt along the skyscraper street and carry weights
       Heavier than themselves;
       By the rotted piers where sunk slime feeds the lilly-pads,
       Not earth's end.
       The machines shattering invisibles
       And which wrecked the still life
       Precede the singling out; the setting up of things
       Upholds the wrist's force; and
       The blood in the ear
       Direction of the vertical
       rigidly bound to the head, the
       accelerated motion
       of rotation of the head
       Under the head's hair.
       SOCONY will not always sign off on this air." ("A"-8 61-63)

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  If any of you have web access you
should check out this project that Margaret Crane and Jon Winet are
doing re the Republican Convention this week.  (It will continue
right through the election).  It's called "Democracy--the Last
Campaign."  Here's the URL

http://dtlc.walkerart.org/

And when you get there and see the stars or twinkling lights or
whatever they are, click on one of them and that will take you to
succeeding menus.  I'm writing for it, so is Dodie Bellamy, Roberto
Tejada has been writing, David Levi Strauss, oh, there's quite a few
of us all giving our opinions on the Republican Convention from
wherever we happen to be.  Margaret and Jon are actually in the press
booth in Philadelphia streaming video, shooting live interviews, the
whole nine yards.  Margaret called me very excited the other night.
Apparently up in the press room at the top of the Convention Center
you get free long distance calls 24 hours a day!!!

Is there anyone in Philadelphia on this list, what's happening, write
me back channel and tell me!

Thanks everyone

In Support of Daisy Zamora, 19 July 2000
En apoyo a Daisy Zamora, 19 de Julio de 2000

Renowned Nicaraguan poet Daisy Zamora is a respected writer and human
rights advocate, combat veteran of the Nicaraguan Revolution, former
voice of underground Radio Sandino, and former Vice Minister of Culture
for the Nicaraguan Revolutionary Government.  After years of  defending,
and speaking for, the voiceless in her own country (women, children, and
the poor in particular), she finds herself threatened and intimidated by
lawless forces at a crucial moment in her country’s history.

Most recently, this took the form of a fraudulent article attributed to
her, published along with her photograph and e mail address, in El Nuevo
Diario, Nicaragua’s largest daily newspaper.  The article was a virulent
attack upon the current government of Nicaragua, as well as specific
individuals, and could have endangered her life.

She learned that this article was written by the prominent Nicaraguan
sociologist and author Oscar René Vargas.  Currently under a restraining
order, he is her ex husband, a man who has stalked and harassed her ever
since she divorced and fled him three years ago.  His fraudulent article
was the latest in a string of acts by a man who has done everything
possible to crush Zamora’s rights since she left him, not to mention
extreme efforts on his part to stop her from pressing legal demands
against him to pay court ordered child support for their two children
who live with her.  Zamora has weathered everything from psychological
abuse to charges of kidnapping by this man, but she has refused to back
down on issues of major importance to most women in Nicaragua.

El Nuevo Diario gave her the opportunity to publish a rebuttal and
exposé of the fraudulent Vargas article, and she used that space in
their newspaper to make her situation very public.  She chose to break
her silence, knowing that if a woman of her accomplishments could be
treated in such a manner, then voiceless, powerless women facing similar
situations all over Nicaragua would have no alternative but to suffer in
silence.  The fraudulent article was intended to endanger her safety,
repress her voice as a writer, damage her ability to publish her
opinions freely, and restrict her freedom of movement to and from
Nicaragua, but it served only to stimulate her energy and anger against
injustice.  She exposed her private life and came out powerfully against
the repression she has experienced as a woman, knowing she is not
alone.  Her plight is mirrored in the lives of countless women in
Nicaragua who have not yet realized full social equality, and she is
determined to expose the truth of these attempts to repress women’s
voices on every social level in Nicaragua.  In addition to publishing
her rebuttal, El Nuevo Diario tightened its security, and responded with
integrity, informing Zamora that Vargas, who frequently published in
their pages in the past, will never again be published by them in any
capacity because of his fraudulent article.

However, in spite of Zamora’s vigorous efforts, no legal action has been
taken against Vargas for his fraudulent article, but that must be
corrected.  Such individual terrorism and repression must not be
tolerated in free society, especially in an impoverished Central
American country that needs its strongest voices and press to be as free
as possible to help it emerge from years of political confusion and
chronic poverty.  Nicaragua will soon face profoundly important
Presidential elections that will determine the course of its future as a
nation.

Such manipulation and disrespect for the press, and the attempt to
silence an important writer, could set back the cause of human rights in
Nicaragua by decades.  Newspapers are still a vital source of
information there, and must not be hindered in their role of
contributing to social progress.  If there can be no faith in the
authorship of what they publish, they will lose their power as reliable
information sources, and that is a matter of concern to all who believe
in the concept of a free press.   Tolerating this type of behavior sends
a wrong message to the people of Nicaragua at a time when women’s rights
are in a fledgling state, and at a political moment when the country is
in need of as many examples of justice and fairness as possible.

We the undersigned represent thousands of writers, artists, and human
rights advocates around the world who have been alerted to this grave
situation.  We call upon the government and media of Nicaragua to
conduct full scale investigations into this crime by Oscar René Vargas
against their free press, and the attempt to endanger one of their most
important writers.  We urge them to guarantee her safety to continue
speaking, writing, traveling, and working for justice, on behalf of
writers everywhere, and in the name of fairness to the emerging voices
of women who are struggling to be heard and should not be silenced by
those who believe they can act with impunity.  Such impunity spells a
death sentence for human rights and the free press.

Subject:      Berkeley commencement speech
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

It was ten years ago this week that Iraq invaded Kuwait and the US began
massing troops in the Gulf region and simultaneously imposing economic
sanctions against Iraq. Those sanctions have never been lifted.

Below is the transcript of a commencement speech given at UC Berkeley in June
2000 by Fadia Rafeedie. She is a top student and an acitivist for Palestinian
rights.Her speech below preceded Sec. of State Albright's.
Please read what she says here. She is someone to be proud of.

_________________



I don't know why I'm up here articulating the viewpoints of a lot of my
comrades out there who were arrested, and not them. It's not because I got,
you know, straight A's or... maybe it is. Maybe that's the way the power
structure works, but I'm very fortunate to be able to give them a voice. I
think that's what I'm going to do, so if you give me your attention, I'd
really appreciate it.

I was hoping to speak before Secretary Albright, but that was also a
reflection of the power structure, I think, to sort of change things around
and make it difficult for people who are ready to articulate their voice in
ways they don't usually get a chance to.

So I'm going to improvise, and I'm going to mention some things that she
didn't mention at all in her speech but which most of the protesters were
actually talking about. You know, I think it's really easy for us to feel
sorry for her, and I was looking at my grandmothers who are actually in the
audience - my grandmother and her sister - who weren't really happy with
all the protesters, and I think they thought that wasn't really respectful
of them, and a lot of you didn't, I don't think, because you came to hear
her speak.

But I think what the protesters did was not embarrass our university. I
think they dignified it.

Because secretary Albright didn't even mention Iraq, and that's what they
were here to listen to. And I think sometimes NOT saying things - not
mentioning things - is actually lying about them. [Applause]

And what I was going to tell her while she was sitting on the stage with
me, I was going to remind her and I was going to remind you that four years
ago from this Friday when we were freshmen, I heard her on 60 Minutes
talking to a reporter who had just returned from Iraq.

The reporter was describing that ½ a million children were dying [died] due
to the sanctions that this country was imposing on the people of Iraq. And
she told her, listen, "that's more.. children than have died in Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. Do you think the price is worth it?" [Albright] looked into
the camera and she said, "the price is worth it."

And I was going to tell her, "do you really think the price is worth it??!"
Since that time, 3 times that number of... people have died in Iraq.

I mean, we're about 5,000 here today. Next month by the time we graduate,
that's as many people who are going to die in Iraq because of the
sanctions. This is what House Minority Whip David Boniors calls
'infanticide masquerading as policy.'

Now, I don't want to make the mood somber here because this is our
commencement, but commencement means beginning, and I think it's important
for us to begin where civilization itself began, and where it's now being
destroyed. [applause]

Let me talk to you a little bit... a little bit more about the sanctions,
because I think it's very important. Now, I'm a Palestinian, I would really
love to talk about the struggle for the liberation of my country, and to
talk about a whole bunch of other things... and I see some people maybe
rolling their eyes, and other people nodding... these are controversial
issues, but I need to speak about Iraq because I think what's happening
there is a genocide. It's another holocaust.

And I'm a history major, and sometimes I look back at history and I see
things like the slave trade, the Holocaust... you know, I see... I see
people
dropping atomic bombs and not thinking what the ramifications are, and I
don't want us to think about Iraq that way. It's already a little too late
because 2.5 million people have died and yet these sanctions continue.

For the last 10 years, you wouldn't imagine the kinds of things that aren't
being let into this country: heart machines, lung machines, needles, um...
infrastructural parts to build the economy. Even cancer patients...
sometimes
some of the medicine will be let in, but not ALL of the medicine.

It's very strategic what's let in at what time, because what it does is it
prolongs life, but it doesn't save it.

In Iraq, the hospitals... they clean the floors with gasoline because
detergent isn't even allowed in because of the sanctions.

These are all United States policies.

And Secretary Albright - I have no conflict with HER, you know, as an
individual.. I don't happen to RESPECT her, but she belongs to a larger
power structure. She's a symbol.

And when the protesters are protesting, it's not because they, you know,
want to pick a fight with the.. with the woman who you guys all happen -
well, many of you - happen to love.

In fact, she was.. she was introduced as the 'greatest woman of our times.'
Now see, to me that's an insult. [applause] This woman is doing HORRIBLE
things.

She's allowing innocent people to suffer and to die.

Iraq used to be the country in the Arab World that had the best medical
services and social services for its people, and NOW look at it. It's, it's
being OBLITERATED.

And a lot of times you might hear it's because of Saddam Hussein and I'd
like to talk a little bit about that. He's a brutal dictator - I agree with
her, and I agree with many of you. But again, I'm a history major, and
history means origins. It means beginnings. We need to see who's
responsible for how strong Saddam Hussein has gotten.

When he... when he was gassing the Kurds, he was gassing them using
chemical weapons that were manufactured in Rochester, New York.

And when he was fighting a long and protracted war with Iran, where 1
million people died, it was the CIA that was funding him. It was U.S.
policy that built this dictator. When they didn't NEED him, they started
imposing sanctions on his people. Sanctions - or any kind of policy -
should be directed at people's governments, not at the people.

The cancer rate in Iraq has risen by over 70 percent since the Gulf War.
The children who are dying from these malicious cancers [and here the front
row walked out of the theatre so I was blabbering incoherently]... um.. and
diseases, they weren't born when the Gulf War happened.

The reason that the cancer rate is so high is because every other day our
country is bombing Iraq STILL. We're still at war with them. They have no
nuclear capabilities. In fact, just last week, the United Nations
inspectors found [again] that Iraq has no nuclear capabilities and yet WE
are BOMBING them every other day with depleted uranium. And what this does
is it releases a gas that the people breathe. It's making them ill, and
they're dying and they don't have medicine.

I saw some of my friends, even, being arrested here today. One of them was
Lillian. Her aunt did a documentary about this depleted uranium, and it
showed that it's being MINED by Native American populations in the United
States. THEY'RE getting sick. Their children are getting sick. And that
depleted uranium is going from HERE, to our MILITARY, to Iraq, and it's
decimating populations. This is a big deal.

And I'm embarrassed that I don't even get to talk about Columbia, because I
saw a few signs about that, too. And my colleague here, Darren Noy, who's
also a Finalist, is very interested in these issues. We don't stand alone.
I'm on stage with allies, I'm looking out at allies, we need allies, my
allies have been taken away [today].

But in general, I mean, I'm speaking to a crowd that gave a standing
ovation to the woman who typifies everything against which I stand, and I'm
still telling you this because I think it's important to understand.

And I think, that if I achieve nothing else, if this makes you think a
little bit about Iraq, think a little bit about U.S. foreign policy, I've
succeeded.

I don't want to take too much of your time, but I want to end my speech
with a slogan that hangs over my bed in Arabic. It says, "La tastaw7ishu
tareeq el-7aq, min qilit es-sa'ireen fihi" and that translates into, "Fear
not the path of truth for the lack of people walking on it." I think our
future is going to be the future of truth, and we're going to walk on that
path, and we're going to fill it with travelers.

Different cultures.  In my line of paid work, given recent extreme
cuts in library journal acquisitions, we rely on UnCover.  Since
no-one makes any money off mathematical journal articles, no-one
minds UnCover distributing her (mathematical) work.  But then again
we generally don't retain copyright either.

Good luck to all who were unfairly treated.

Hello Ken:
Socony-Vacuum was a gas company, gasoline company for automobiles--I'm
sure they had a commercial on a radio station, but some commercials did ed
witha "signing off for  Blank maker of that good blank blank." Or there
was the double commercial "Ipana for the smile of beauty, Sal Hepatica for
the smile of Health"

I see you're on page63-- on p 58: "Technology throughs light on mental
conceptions"--and then the passage about repetitions on p 59--I suspect we
are to think of the line about how one listen and pereives. Technology
seems to be woven in with the "political"
        The first line
                        And of labor

        Last line

                        Labor, light lights in air, on earth, in earth.

A line so great that he tacks on a coda and repeats it!

        Delighted that you are workig on  Z.
        By the way, when we lived in a bigger house we rented the third
floor to musicians, usually violinists, and one of the said she was going
to New York to a master class or something like that with a Paul Zukowsky,
so I mentioned Z, and she came back absolutely frozen--after "Are you the
son of the famous poet, Louis Zukofsky"  She said he just glared at her

        I guess the shrapnel haunts.
        Good to see you in Orono.
        Cheers,
        Bill

How about Elizabeth Willis--I do'nt think she's on this list.
If you do find out where Pat Rehm is, I'd appreciate your back channelling
her address to me. She is really fine.
By the Liz gave a reading of her own poetry at Orono-- very powerful
Cheers

 From the recently posted country stats, I have learned that there are
2 list members in Spain. Will you two please email me and make
yourselves known? I am a poet from the U.S. (originally from its San
Diego outpost), soon to be relocating to Sevilla, and will be looking
for allies overseas. Thanks, Cole Heinowitz

ANNOUNCING
[special offer to the poetics list follows the announcement]

A Book of the Book: Some Works & Projections About the Book & Writing

Edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Steven Clay

A Book of the Book: Some Works & Projections About the Book & Writing
comprises works from over ninety writers, poets, painters, performers,
scholars, critics, anthropologists and historians. Illustrated throughout
in black and white, it features a full-color, double-gatefold facsimile of
the great Blaise Cendrars/Sonia Delaunay book of 1913 "La Prose du
Transsib=E9rien."

"A collection for the general reader and the specialist, "A Book of the Book=
"
is an accessible and erudite set of readings on the book as a mythic and
material object. These texts comprise a vivid exploration of the poetics of
the book, a multi-faceted study nurtured by the literary and ethnographic
scope of its editors' vision, that argues compellingly for the continued
survival of this most mundane and metaphoric of artifacts. In a moment when
irresponsible, inflammatory ravings about the demise of print rage through
the cultural landscape, this collection offers serious reflection upon the
real profundity of the book as a symbolic force within the poetic and
spiritual imagination that remains the wellspring of human culture. Drawn
from diverse realms - of avant-garde art, anthropology, textual criticism,
literature, and speculative thought - this will be the definitive
collection for decades to come - a volume whose very physical presence in
the hand performs the rhetoric of its pages in offering its riches to the
reader."

-Johanna Drucker author of "The Alphabetic Labyrinth" and "The Century of
Artists' Books"

Dear Readers,

What follows is my report on the Boston Poetry Conference 2000. Gary's
comments are in double brackets and preceded by his name [[Gary: Hello!
Testing, testing. I was a very, very bad conference-attendee and did *not*
take notes. But, when I remember something, I'll just step in like this and
bleat it out.]] I apologize for 1) any misquotes or wrong linebreaks in
quotes from poems 2) missing some readings and presentations (the conference
was pretty tightly scheduled), and 3) not writing as well as Kevin Killian -
I'm not really a "linear narrative" kind of girl, but, well, here goes ...

Gary and I rode to Boston in a van driven very safely by Tracy Blackmer,
accompanied also by Douglas Rothschild, Prageeta Sharma, Adeena Karasick,
Rachel Levitsky, and Eddie Berrigan. The ride was extremely fun as we kept
our minds active playing a game called "Essences" which reminded me of games
I used to play in my ESL classrooms. To play the game, one person thinks of
a person (we mostly chose poets) and the others ask questions like "If this
person were a smell/color/musical instrument/poetry venue/person in the
car/food/ etc., what/who ____ would they be?" to find out who the person is.
One of the best was Jordan Davis, whose color was pink, fruit was cherries,
and smell was nail polish. [[Gary: Yeah, that was Prageeta's person.
Rachel's was Maureen Owen, who we should have guessed, but didn't. Eddie's
was Lou Reed: Q: "If this person was a country, what country would they be?"
A: "Long Island." Mine was Leslie Scalapino: Q: "If this person was a book,
how would they be designed?" A: "Oh, uh, with reverse type on a darker
background, I think, and a long thin picture of something, maybe a
landscape, just below the text." I was proud because I guessed Nada's: Sei
Shonagon.]] Eddie has the notebook with all of the clues written down just
begging to be transformed (or just typed up) into poems. Other discussion in
the car had to do with ethnicity and aggressiveness - the three Jewish women
in the car feeling that our tendency to be assertive & boisterous was almost
certainly due to the our lineage's permission to be so. A stop at McDonald's
in Connecticut found Adeena eating a giant vanilla soft-serve and me the
rest of the pizza Rachel had so kindly brought. [[Gary: I couldn't believe
we had stopped at a McDonald's! But, duh, like, what else is going to be on
the side of the freeway like that in the middle of Connecticut or whatever?
Besides, to my utter shame and horror, on the ride back, we stopped at a
virtually identical McDonald's - Eddie said that the only difference was
which soda machines were where - and I actually broke down and ATE A
CHEESEBURGER AND FRIES despite being a quasi-vegetarian.]] Tracy was quiet
most of the way; she kept her eyes on the road. Douglas told (in the course
of playing "essences") a Grimm fairy tale about "Six-in-one-blow" in his
famous discursive style, and he also very kindly read my Tarot cards.

Upon arriving at the Boston Artstitute, hungry Adeena and I went off to have
Indian food and talk about relationships while Doug and Gary went to get
pizza ... A. and I got so enfolded in our talk we missed the first part of
Friday's reading and walked in in the middle of Dan Bouchard's
Olson/Rothschild poem, having missed the "frightening" Williams poem he
read. [[Gary: Before the reading, Dan gave me a copy of a recently
self-published pamphlet, _I Remember_, which has a picture on the cover of
him at I guess some kind of rally or protest having to do with housing -
he's a tenant organizer. But, each "I Remember" has to do with animals:
sometimes pets, sometimes deer or other wild animals, and ends with a spider
seen earlier on the day the piece was written. Anyway. I think it was Mitch
Highfill who had said something about the Williams poem being "frightening."
It was. & it was great. I wanted Dan to read his longish "Private History of
Books," but he didn't; instead, he read "At the Intersection of Olson and
Rothschild, which contains a reconfigured line from Ginsberg: "O, Charles
Olson, what wide thoughts I have of you tonight!" There's a line in that
poem about smoke-walking, which I take to mean going out and smoking &
walking, which I can't do anymore, having quit I guess two or three months
ago.]]

Following Dan, Beth Anderson read from a 20-poem sequence of 20-line poems.
[[Gary: I don't remember much about these poems ... I don't know what my
problem was. I think I was still sort of zoning after the five+ hour ride
up. But, also, Beth's poems are very intensely abstract, and not easy to
focus on, if you don't have them there with you to look at while she
reads.]]

Jordan Davis followed beaming out his boyish grin and really pleased the
crowd, myself included really resonating with his bizarre collocations and
ear for speech. He read some short poems, one that sounded like the words on
the side of a delivery truck: "Express. Express.", "Karaoke of Myself" with
all its "stets", a monster poem and the very popular "Yeah/No." He was sent
off with a chorus of HOOHOOs from the audience. [[Gary: I think the monster
poem is called "W." Actually, this reading was mostly the things he had read
at St. Marks a while back with Kenneth Koch, and that was a great reading. I
love what he's doing in this somewhat-longer poems, there's a kind of
rapid-eye movement combined with rapid-brain movement. That sounds stupid,
but his work's interesting - I should I guess explain how the eye-brain are
related, in his poems, and I suppose there are seemingly causal
relationships between what gets seen then what gets said, but they're not
one-to-one. So there's this constant rush sensation, which isn't as chaotic
as that sounds, but this rush & going back and forth between this kind of
description-of-poet-in-the-world-seeing and then this other language, which
I'm assuming, for the moment anyway, is probably what he's put down in
journals, thoughts. I'm babbling. I liked his reading very much.]]

Then came Laura Mullen all in black with a turquoise-y scarf. She read with
lots of caesurae sounds at the ends of her lines and seemed to write a lot
about face, the idea of the face and makeup. I have in my notes that there
was a poem about nail polish but I may be mistaken. Some of her lines: "You
might be more you on the medication" "We are made of chemicals". [[Gary: I
think she read a poem where she'd taken one of Bernadette Mayer's poems and
done a Bernadette "experiment" on it. I have to admit I don't remember much
about it. This is the one serious problem I have at readings, or no that's a
lie, I mean writing about them. If I haven't read the work before, it's
often impossible for me to reconstruct the stuff later, unless it's really
obvious to me what's going on in the poem, and it's not usually. ]]

Lee Ann read mostly from Polyverse - her present beau for Forrest Gander who
was Present, her long continuous Bernadette Mayer experiment piece she wrote
while actually on the phone with Bernadette, weaving B's language into the
piece. She read a couplet she'd written in high school about Boston - I
don't remember it exactly but it rhymed Boston with something like "a city
to get lost in." She sang a couple of songs, one that had a lot of little
animals such as chipmunks in it, and birds too, I think. [[Gary: I think
there was a fox in her song, but I don't know about these other animals. I
especially liked the Bernadette-on-the-phone poem, or continuous sentence I
guess it was, there's something I can't call it "more natural" because it's
all artifice of course, but for me it's an entirely different experience
than the acrostics and hymns.]]

Forrest Gander read sort of abstract erotic work. Here's a line: "wiping my
eyes between your breasts/ giving it some spur," He read a longer
quasi-narrative between whose strophes or episodes he banged the podium most
effectively. "The top of my head taken off/ to reveal a terrible honking."
[[Gary: At one point during his introductory banter, Forrest said something
like: "I think in a number of years we're each going to realize and admit
that we've *all* been writing a Bernadette Mayer experiment." This was
actually the best of Forrest's work that I've heard (or read). He did this
great sort of "cranking the thing up again" gesture of repeating the last
couple of words of the previous stanza (or prose chunk?) each time.]]

After the reading, Gary, Jack Kimball, Mitch Highfill, Kim Lyons and I went
out - or I should say, they went out; I didn't want to go inside the smoky
Irish bar that smelled of cigarettes and badly washed water glasses so I
stayed outside and sat on a stoop. [[Gary: I tried to get her to come in to
the bar, because it felt weird leaving her out there, but she didn't want to
come in, and then Janet Bowden came along and said she'd hang out outside,
and so I said, okay, I'm just gonna go in now, and then I did.]] I wrote
part of a poem and talked to Janet Bowden for a while. Lee Ann came by and
put me in her video. Then Gary and I went to Jack Kimball's place - he's
newly returned from Japan. We talked for a long time and then I said I'm so
tired I have to go to sleep and they stayed up talking loudly about ... the
relationship between Olson & Prynne ... [[Gary: Yeah, but also about what it
MEANS that such and such gets carried from one writer to another, and, um,
well, it was just so much more COMPLEX and IMPORTANT than that, and I, uh -
oh, forget it ...]] and I got mad - it was three in the morning - and kind
of chewed Gary out. I was already very very tired. I cried. [[Gary: Okay,
okay, I feel guilty already! When I got home, I defrosted the refrigerator,
even. Oh, and I bought Nada a wok and some flowers. We kind of had a fight,
later.]]

SATURDAY:

We got there late at the end of Betsy Fagin's reading so I didn't really
have time to focus in on her work. I noticed her rust-colored shirt and her
reading style as if the words were kind of foreign or scary. [[Gary: I was
especially sad we were late because I wanted to see Betsy's reading most. I
think I've seen her read once or twice before, but only in group readings,
and I really love her work. Since I missed it, here's a poem I like from a
groovy self-published chapbook Nada & I found at St. Mark's called _Physical
Culture_:

REAL THING

Over on the always all that happens
the glass actually
the glass in sidewalks

I say it shinies
he explains recycling, glass actually
how point well taken

and them standing there
more than women who faked hair,
lipstick wrapped around you

choreographed moves talk
about projects how
working on artistic very serious,

about project
and developing art or music
producing I mean offers

really suggestions
in contact and want your card.
hook up, get more out there

turn inner city kids to gold
learn them golf
and golf fashions

wear the black kids, demographic,
will wear the white kids
and then everyone only daily.]]

There was a pile of fortune cookies on the table next to the podium and some
of the readers were opening them and introducing their readings with their
fortunes.

Katy Lederer's fortune read "You are broad-minded and socially active." - as
apt a characterization as any. As she did when I saw her read at the Zinc
Bar, she asked for feedback about the microphone level. I like it when poets
do that. Some lines from Katy, read in her soft and somewhat wispy but
!audible! voice: "I am happy with my lot." "My lot in life, 'twas my only
companion." "To perfect an imitation of myself" "The women and the men put
on a mouth." [[Gary: Another line I remember was: "O, I wish to be, major or
whatever" except that as she read it, it didn't sound as sassy as it seems
written down.]]

Tracy Blackmer has an inimitable reading style: it's deadpan but animated,
insidiously layered with ironies but not cutting, even when she read lines
like "So, you're a fan of Mike Myers, too?" or "Groupies - am I supposed to
guide them?" "Guess who's on the cover of Vanity Fair? I am." "Tracy means
imperious, bold." "Salami for breakfast, cheese for lunch, cheese for
dinner." Tracy was sticking voodoo needles in the wax doll of pop culture
left and right, "street of skinny girls/ their flat stomachs/ their fat
boyfriends/ carrying falafels." [[Gary: She does these hilarious dialogues,
some of which take place in chat rooms on the internet. This is only
tangentially related, but I just started reading Steve Benson's _Blue Book_,
which is of course filled with dialogues too, but of a very different kind.
Anyway, Tracy told us later that we got the edited version of her reading,
because her mom was in the audience! Actually, I think she might have said
hello to her during the reading. But, I think she was horrified at one point
because she had forgotten to take out a "vagina" or something and read it
out loud before realizing it. This sparked a whole "Parents, Whaddaya
Supposed to Do?" conversation back in NYC.]]

Arielle Greenberg in a pink floral old-fashioned dress read a lullaby:
"Sealegs. sealegs, come back to me." She very kindly got the audience to
applaud hard-working organizer Aaron Kiely. Some more Arielle lines:
"Artists are very much like terror, terrified fish" "Let's make out tonight
in a certain interesting way" "Thirst loved me" "In the cartoons, everything
was backward and made from dots". She read a funny list poem she'd written
in response to so many people at the Orono conference referring to the
"longer projects" their presentations were taken from: "The project in which
the white people don't speak like that." Arielle left the stage with a
schoolgirl curtsey. [[Gary: I had been writing back and forth with Arielle
for many months without having yet met her, so it was especially thrilling
to finally see her. Her last piece was something that she wrote after going
I think to a church somewhere and hearing all of these hymns. Stephen Ellis,
who printed up a bunch of broadsides for people who'd come to the
conference, did one of Arielle's, which is wonderful. Anyway, I was excited,
because now I knew who she was, and could go up and say hello, although I
actually waited a while after that, I think, to do so.]]

Wiry Ric Carfagna read in a thick east coast accent and was sometimes hard
to hear but what lines I could catch intrigued me: "I speak from this
distance to disrupt the status quo" "an easily compromised theory of the
misdirected" "sky full of browbeaten errata" . He began one piece about
"americana" and "subjectivity" with a quote from Marinetti about images
following each other in rapid succession, and to read it put on a white
straw hat on whose hatband were several sunflowers. [[Gary: I totally could
not hear Ric read for some reason, which is why I tend to try and avoid
sitting all the way in the back, which is - duh - where I was while he was
reading.]]

Marcella Durand followed with poems that explored light, subjectivity, and
other subtleties of perception. Some of her lines: "a creeping soft movement
subject to your displeasure" "lighthood and selfhood" " "this source of
gravity" " small onions glazed in tamarind sauce I help you visit" "your
tender throat the reflection of mapping". It seemed to me that compared to
most other readers she didn't read for very long - she was on stage, and
then, then, she was gone. [[Gary: her reading was way too short. She's an
amazing poet, I think, and I kick myself for not picking up _City of Ports_
while we were there. But, whatever. I also wanted this Kirby Doyle book, one
of those Poets Press things that Diane Di Prima published, but this isn't
really the time or place to talk about that.]]

Elfin Keith Waldrop, with his "pagan or ... foreign hairstyle" read from
"Haunt" - about the death camps???-" solemn, set up camp, watch me
disappear" and "Potential Random". He said the poems in Potential Random
didn't really have any reason to be together except that they all had the
same [apt] title. Some lines: "making our thought opaque" " "this poem is
quite impersonal" "its aftertaste trailing dust from nothing to nothing".
[[Gary: Actually, I was spaced out during the first part of Keith's reading,
and came back "to" when he started reading from "Potential Random."]]

David Kirschenbaum in his strappy sandals opened the Saturday afternoon set
with poems of community: to Lee Ann ("All the boys love Lee Ann Brown"),
Sean Cole, a postcard to Anne Waldman... With Arielle he read a dream poem.
[[Gary: The dream was a Classic Dream: Arielle and her boyfriend Rob go into
a neighbor's apartment and begin looking through EVERYTHING. Then, the
neighbor comes home and I think confronts them, but I don't remember what
happens after that.]] He read "If Love Were Baseball" which meant nothing to
me because I don't speak baseball at all. [[Gary: Me neither. I don't get
sports at all. All I know is that my father watched it and seemed to get a
lot out of it, and that's pretty much reason for me to ignore it. But,
people seem to like it quite a bit, so I certainly don't want to say
something horrible and disparaging about a Nation's Pastime or like that.]]
Lines I liked: "I had claws from fifty gophers" "a relationship song between
Pharaoh and Moses" - I have a bit of a Moses fixation so that last
especially made me smile.

Kim Lyons was up next, opening with "Dandelion": "twin nuclear hands lit the
match." I could hear her breath going into her body: "reddish telepathy in
tangerines" "pharaonic storehouses of gold furniture" "I remember eating
turtle soup." Kim read a long piece in 26 sections about places she had or
hadn't been to - on vacation?: "Once blood ran down my legs there" "big
golden cat's eye fried in a pan" "When I had amniocentesis in Queens
momentarily left the body" "monomany" "ate one slender onion stalk beside a
...? egg and kickass hot sauce" She also read "Hypothesis" which seemed to
me to be a poem in the shape of a diorama: "intricate forces discursive
shadows" "unexplained convulsive stream" (she pretty much summed up my
poetics right there, also with:) "a kind of gluey furnace" "I lie down in
formal tulip beds." Kim had left the long prose part of this poem in her
carpet bag (someone shouted, "carpetbagger") and paused to find it to no
avail - there was a silence - which Kim broke by saying wasn't she like
Tonya (I forget her last name... Harding?) the ice skater when she fell down
on the ice - Quick Thinking, Lyons. She also read the bumbly, dreamy,
tangled "Monday Monday": "got group masturbation" "am dropped off quantum"
and MY FAVORITE LINE: "Take the power back, warblers." Right on. [[Gary: Kim
is great. I felt bad that she lost her page, though. I think it preyed on
her afterwards much more than it should have. Kim said something later that
night that I was actually SHOCKED to hear come out of her mouth: We were
walking along behind Nada and Adeena, and she was actually talking about
something else, I think about one of the readers we had just seen, and she
all the sudden interrupted herself and said: "You know, Nada and Adeena
totally win the Best Asses Award." I said: "I'm glad it was you that said
that!"]]

Brenda Coultas took the stage in jeans and a grey t-shirt, grinning, telling
us about her nightmare bus ride to B-town. The bus driver, under the
influence of something, took them on an unexplained detour through the
Catskills. [[Gary: She described this later at the bar during one of the
breaks. Wow. Totally freaky, the driver stopping every 45 minutes or hour,
because he'd been nodding off! and so would then walk to the back of the
bus, so you couldn't see him, and then walked back and got back into his
seat, "totally perked up." At one point someone asked him if he knew where
he was and he said yeah and they asked him how much longer it would be and
he said "I have no idea."]] Brenda also told us she writes about five poems
a year - "as Joanne Wasserman says, they're like Chanel suits; they only
make a few a year but they're exquisitely hand-crafted." She said she was
going to read some poems about the Bowery and Northern Indiana that were
"composed of sentences rather than words" (at this point the pedant in my
head said, excuse me, but what are the sentences composed of?): "It had a
little DNA. Inside the DNA it had a little story. To get to the DNA the eye
was pulverized." "They were having lots of sex of all kinds." "I ate the
box." Brenda says not koo-pons but kew-pons, I noticed. She writes so much
about eyes: "I would have a boy's eye implanted on my forehead" "It was very
exciting to be naked in a crowd while wearing three eyes." She read a piece
I was too interested in to take notes on about PENIS STALKS she kept in a
jar and sometimes took out to touch the penis stalks together. She also read
a piece which figured herself as various mass-market toys: "Hello - I'm a
retired Beanie Baby." Everyone agreed that Brenda's reading was wonderful.
[[Gary: Me too, all the eyes made me kind of paranoid after. No, that's an
exaggeration. But, you know. It was great.]]

Edwin Torres opened with a Cage-ean moment of silence he called "Surface
Noise." It was very powerful to make us focus for a moment on all the
incidental sounds that were filling the air in the absence of speech. He
then went into a kind of "conversation" piece that made me think of that
early scene in Pulp Fiction where they're in the car eating hamburgers.
Edwin's hand moved rhythmically in rapper-like punctuation. He read a
didactic Utopia poem I felt pessimism from and then went into "Small Town
USA" which I can only describe as a kind of insulting croon - like a cartoon
voiceover in garbled speech - he also, I thought, sounded like some kind of
voice giving dictation, or a proofreader - all the time parodying the small
mentality of smalltown. Next was "Andy Warhol as Moses" - more Moses! - you
can bet I was happy - about wearing an Andy Warhol t-shirt so brightly
colored with faces of celebrities that he could walk through a sea of bees
and part it. Next a macaronic trilingual sound poem I hugely dug. Then
something that sounded to me like a discursive hyper-philosophical bad acid
trip w/ lines like "there's a point you realize that you won't go out with
what you came with" and "welcome to the age of nearness." A poem taking off
on the word "boy" - it made me think of ... dare I say it ... "West Side
Story": "Boy, Boy, crazy boy - get loose boy!" And then a piece about being
Puerto Rican and identity and outer symbols of identity I thought was really
brave and vulnerable: "if you even have thoughts of fitting in you're not."
During the last part of Edwin's reding I noticed David Kirschenbaum, who was
videoing everything, blowing giant bubbles with his gum; I was impressed. I
thought Edwin was *awesome*. [[Gary: Again, I totally agree. The "boy" poem
was great, and kept shifting from, yeah, I guess it reminded me of West Side
Story kind of too, but also this kind of racist use of "boy" and then this
weird I guess kind of neighborhood use of "boy" - but incredibly fast. Like
he was showing all these postcards of how this word might be variously
inflected. Dude!]]

Sheila Murphy [[Gary: Oh. My. Fucking. God. You have no idea how excited I
was that Sheila Murphy was reading here!]] in red t-shirt and pixie haircut
launched right into her poem. "Just zen enough a sacrament" "al l of the
ledged places happiness affords." She referred to Thales when introducing
"The Indelible Occasion" [[Gary: No, actually, "Thales" is a poem title. I
don't know what "The Indelible Occasion" might be.]] "She would drive anyone
to sobriety" "Philosophy's a crate of leaves, ripe for dispersal." Sheila
read very carefully, articulating gorgeously: "this lockstep feast, this
livermore" "sandwich bread and opulence inside the crust of brain." She
described some of her poems as haibun, the single line a haiku in some
relation to the prose "patch". A poem she described as "pure mental
breath" - one of Gary's favorites - in fact I think he took her book
("Falling in Love Falling in Love with You Syntax") to work [[Gary: I sure
did.]] so I can't check the title but anyway it was something like
"Abscondily with Plenty Mercredi": "blossoms synonymous with syntax for a
change." [[Gary: No, actually, "Pure Mental Breath" is a series of poems,
and Sheila read the one that begins: "Blossom, synonymous with curfew for a
change." But, yes, she did read another poem called "Abscondily with Plenty
Mercredi," which is, yeah, one of my all time favorite Sheila poems.]] At
one line, "Mercury slips out of retrograde at last", I elbowed Gary because
he had quoted that line in one my favorite of his letter-poems to me, and we
grinned at each other knowingly. Actually Sheila's lines are sprinkled
throughout those poems of his ... [[Gary: It's true. But, stupidly, I don't
think I wound up reading any of those particular poems. Anyway I was
thrilled because Sheila read mostly my favorite poems from my favorite
collection of hers, the selected, _Falling in Love Falling in Love with You
Syntax_, including the title poem, which is what she ended with. If the
conference had ended at this point, I would have been totally fulfilled. Do
I need to rent out a giant billboard on Houston Street?: "I [HEART] SHEILA
MURPHY" with a picture of her book and then my face also, crying because I'm
reading it and overwhelmed with emotion?]]

And as if that stunning set weren't great enough, next up was the hilarious
and pithy Michael Gizzi beginning with "tercets written after rereading
Dante", about which comment he said," Don't you hate it when people say
things like that?" A line I liked: "flies on real tapestry." He has the
noir-est cowboy raymond chandler voice, doesn't he?: "ham on a rainbow"
"mumble, and be amazed" "money isn't everything, if you count clouds" "A
treatise on cowlicks" " A sweeping look at hard candy" "Why, Sargasso sea,
are you so geek?" "The edema of an important breast-beating". In his plaid
shirt and sandals, he looked so sincere saying " I've only joined one
organization in my life, and I won't say what it is, but it was hard to get
into. But it wasn't." What was it? "Cocktails made of wines/ You have a
nosegay for a heart." [[Gary: I remember specifically "Requiem for a Tent,"
which Michael introduced saying that he'd just had dental work, was on
laughing gas, and his wife had told him that her tent blew away and "that
was all I needed." His voice is perfect for these poems. ]]

I really had to pee at this point, so I dashed out and missed Rosmarie
Waldrop. ... [[Gary: Oh dear. And me without my notebook. I really could NOT
focus by this point. But, I did see Cole Heinowitz sitting in the row or two
in front of me SQUEALING when Rosmarie announced that she was going to read
from this one particular book. She got a huge round of applause and
whoops.]]

[[Gary: I'm not sure if it happened at this point or earlier in the day, but
there was a publishing panel David Kirschenbaum put together that Nada
missed but I saw. Unfortunately for you, Nada is the one who kept the notes.
I don't remember every participant's name even. The first guy, for instance,
all I remember is that he was from the south and was publishing broadsides
with a couple of his friends, mostly it seemed of people like Ferlinghetti.
He had some great anecdotes, though. One involved hiring Hunter S. Thompson
to read, and how much money -- $20,000? - they lost hosting that one.
Apparently, Thompson was totally drunk and you couldn't understand anything
he said. And he was kicking people? Something. Hmm. Oh, who else? Katy
Lederer talked about _Explosive_, which just had a new issue come out. She
chewed gum, read from an iMac laptop (her printer had malfunctioned prior to
leaving for Boston) about basically coterie poetics. "Writing should be
amoral" she said at one point. Jill Stengel talked about a+bend press, which
is this amazing series that does two books a month. They're beautiful
chapbooks, and she promised to send us some that we didn't have, so this is
kind of a Public Begging Spectacle I guess: "Please Send Them Jill Please
Send Them Please Dear God They're So Cool!" She's pregnant, by the way!
Congratulations! Oh, who else? Ed Foster talked about Talisman House and all
of the important anthologies they've published and how the chain stores are
basically ensuring no one will ever read them. And how distribution mostly
sucks. "Where are you gonna go," he asked, at one point, significantly. "The
internet?" Sue Landers playfully elbowed me and gave me a look. I'm sure
there was someone else, but my memory is awful. Someone! Fill in the
details!]]

Evening set: Michael Franco, I noticed, used the words shtick, schmooze and
spiel in his opening spiel and he isn't even Jewish. He also had a rising
intonation at caesurae kind of reading style. Early on he invoked his
trinity of heroes Olson Duncan Creeley. I found myself tuning out a little
bit. But I did write down a few lines: "what truth there was/ is." His
spectacles were on strings, I noticed. "Instantly a shadow teaches the
frivolity of will." "the absent stone now here on my desk." He called the
parts of his poems "circumferences." [[Gary: Where was I that I missed
this??? I actually had seen Michael read at St. Marks earlier in the year,
and was kind of primed to see him read here, but totally missed it. I think
I walked in right as he was ending.]]

Donna de la Perriere and Joseph Lease were stuck in traffic, but made it
just in the nick of time. Donna had trouble with the microphone level. She
wore thick black glasses. I noted down: "the high note" "the frantic
tapping" "many legged creature that scatters the moment you come near. There
seemed in one piece to be metaphors of dryness and bleakness, but I think I
was getting really zoned out and feeling sleep deprivation at this point:
"the white enamel of appliances glows in the bare lot." [[Gary: I am an
idiot or deaf. I don't remember a single word of her reading! Ack! I'll
never be forgiven, and rightly so. I can't comment on the rest of this
evening, as I was pretty much about to pass out by this time.]]

Joseph Lease, in a large denim shirt, had to spit out his gum: "there's
always that tension of being burdened with I." I sensed some negativity: "He
hated himself and he hated the town." "Listen with pain." I liked this line:
"A boy remembered he was a solid black rock, lima bean-shaped." and also
"Everything became culture, where you hang your name."

Ange Mlinko, looking chic in a tight scarlet skirt, was up next with the
unenviable task of preceding Robert Creeley. She seemed a little
internalized but read precisely. "If the animals don't come to you then you
must not be Orpheus." Well ... yeah! Her vocabulary curlicued: "hamadryad",
"fete galante", "serious violins", "madrigal "... "even the rose has this
problem" In one poem she asked a question I very much wanted to answer,
"When do goldfish become carp?" Basically, goldfish are to carp what
wallabies are to kangaroos. [[Gary: To give you an idea of how out of it I
was by this time, I only remember that I *thought* one of the poems she read
had just been published in _The World_, but she assured me later that it
wasn't, and when I checked, yeah, it wasn't. Oh, wait, I do remember a few
things, actually. Ange started off with new poems, most of which were
completely new to me, and then ended with I think some from her book
Matinees. The last one ended with her pointing at the audience and us going
"Go to Boston!"]]

Creeley was welcomed with a big fame clap. When he said of the conference,
"It's a terrific occasion," I could only think of Gary doing his dead-on
Creeley impression. I wondered if Creeley himself might not be doing a
Creeley impression, in his army jacket and darkened bomber glasses and
monosyllables. "But now to be here/ putting my hand on the table/ I felt it
turn into wood." "One dreamed of a thoughtless moment" I loved this: "My
mother, dying, came out of the anaesthetic ecstatic, saying 'it's all free,
you don't have to pay for any of it'" Other patriarchal wisdom (but isn't
this AMBIGUOUS?): "nothing's apart from all." Hmmm. And "what you do/ is how
you get along/ what you did/ is all it ever means." The venerable master
left the stage with an even bigger fame clap than the one that had welcomed
him, and some people standing in an attempt to ovate him. [[Gary: Creeley's
a great reader and I could pretty much listen to him reading the phone book.
But, really, I was dust about an hour & a half prior to this, and don't
remember a lick of it. Superamount Sadness: I love Creeley.]]

SUNDAY morning I walked around Jack's beautiful suburban neighborhood in the
perfect sunshine, warming up my voice, looking at flowers and quaint New
England houses. But I don't think I really RELAXED, [[Gary: I got up early
and found the coffee place. Newton is a weird town, I don't know what to say
about it, except that the buildings are beautiful, and the trees .... ! oh!
I couldn't imagine going back to Brooklyn after walking around at like 8:00
a.m. in this picture perfect neighborhood ...]]

Rebecca Wolff opened the morning set, in a loose white-ish ... housedress?
and her hair pinned up. I didn't know her work very well before this but I
found I loved it and I also found it very weird: "The world is my cloister/
Last night I sliced the tip of my thumb off." "That which does not kill us,
blah blah blah [that's verbatim]" She read from "Never Enter" - poems not
completed or 'consummated' - great idea for a collection: "I'm in trouble
dad, it's my recombinant.../ I'm in trouble officer, it's my degenerate ..."
She wrote of a "candied impulse through the brain" "where the nascent meets
the latent, I put my tongue in the path." Everything read in a captivating
drone. I felt like I was inside her head. "It's a mitzvah/ lack of
self-consciousness" "God is in the desperation/ in the fallopian tube/ in
coffee can/ in arsenal." "Mannerism no more superficial than a daylily"
"blushing in conversation with animal fame" "I was born with a yellow brain
and cannot make up stories." [[Gary: This was a really fun reading for me
too, and I was sitting in the back! Like an idiot!]]

Prageeta Sharma was next with her nuanced psychological poems: "If it hadn't
been you it would have been someone else" "Have you graced yourself or
better yet have you outsmarted yourself". She read a memory piece about her
hometown, the nearby suburb Framington: "banana seat you ride near me."
Other lines I wrote down: "The lure jerked me with a madcap head" "arranged
my maturity to make it lasting" "I over-identify with being a calf [!!!!]"
She said of one poem, "it's so angry; I'm not angry!" and laughed big. Then
she opened her poem "The Silent Meow" by saying, "I was at this party and
this cat came up to me and its meows were mute, and my friend and I were
like, oh, there are so many metaphors there..." [[Gary: The angry poem was
intense. Maybe Prageeta's not angry because she got it all out & into this
poem!]]

Wendy Kramer, who Gary can also do a SPOT-ON impression of, read three
pieces. I'd heard them all before so only took a few notes although I knew
she'd read them all a little differently from before because her poems are
different each time. Wendy reads collages - sometimes 3-D. Because the poems
change so much in performance, she said the question has arisen for her
"where is the poem?" She read: 1) "Boston Beer Urn", 2) "Tomato Meditation",
and 3) "Sentiment" (a Valentine's day waltz) - of which she said, that,
despite its shape, "it's not a cross, OK? I'm Jewish." Some lines: "from an
original melody by/ sharp/ knife sharp sharp knife dot all right and
reserve" but oh dear I'm faltering here I can't represent Wendy's vivacity
and immediacy on a page. You'll just have to see her for yourself. [[Gary: I
think it was Wendy's reading that made me want to read the Steve Benson
book. I mean, I guess the connection's obvious: they're both doing these
live-reading situations where you're using a text of some kind, something to
spring off of, but much of what does go on is improvisatory. It's an
incredibly brave thing to do, is vulnurable in a way that writing even the
most candid, self-revelatory prose isn't.]]

Patricia Pruitt was next reading something very epistolary and obsessive I
missed the introduction to so I couldn't tell who was writing to whom but
did it have to do with French poets? Lines: "is it orgasmic or mere
agitation?" "is it presumptuous of me to address you at all?" I could tell
my mind had wandered far away because I was getting nervous about my reading
later and I noticed myself noticing a horsefly on the shoulder of Jean Day,
who was sitting right in front of me. Then Ange Mlinko walked in in a
lavender shift dress with delicate blue flower pattern and pinkish inserts
(later she told me it was a Betsy Johnson)-it fit her like a glove - and I
noticed myself growing covetous. [[Gary: I couldn't really hear Patricia!]]

Simon Pettet went right into his poem: "You once said I was ruminating beet
red/ but I was doing no such thing/ I was just giving poetry readings" His
groovy English accent lent credibility to his archaisms. From "Jazz": "Can
she be kinder or straighter. I don't think so." and "it all passes, all but
the lasses." It was at this moment I noticed two black women in the room,
one with a giant turban - was it lime green??-and remembered that the day
before I had seen one black man. It seemed to me to be an exceedingly white
conference. Sigh. [[Gary: True. Is this the part where we post suggestions
for the overworked Aaron Keily? Okay: (a) more time between events and (b)
more diverse make-up of readers!]]

I had to take a break next so I missed Michael Basinski and daughter Natalie
joined by Wendy K. reading collaged cardboard tubes. [[Gary: I saw it. I
couldn't really hear either Natalie nor Wendy. I could tell that the piece
had been worked out somewhat in advance, but was largely improvisatory. So
that there were these ebbs and flows of energy.]]

Returned to hear Jean Day open with her poem "Stranger": "The baby wore an
expression of concern." She described her Atelos book, "The Literal World"
as "an American project," and said she was now working on a book of odes and
fragments. Some lines: " the text that comes down into the head/ sloping
toward the sea" "like an expatiation on tears" "I'll lodge with the eelgrass
family" "Here in the realm of euphoric radicalism" "a dropsical chorus" "You
might be the one they call 'mimic man'." [[I couldn't hear her at all. I
think this was the last reading where I sat all the way in the back. I
finally "got it."]]

Next was the poetics panel. Bill Howe in a very North Beach-y leather hat
talked of a walk with Chris Cheek in England where they talked of noise - he
used the metaphor of a crumbly cliff. "Noise resists of accrual/ [lots of
sound verbs]" Noise, he said, piles and puddles into meaning.
Experimentation is noisy, he said, otherwise it's not experimental. "What
makes something noisy?" he asked. Noise as indicating friction between the
known/ understandable/codified and The New. Noise and Not-Noise overlap - he
said that's the point where experimentation takes place. Noise, he said, is
a loaded term, is valuable and isn't valuable, is and is not aesthetically
pleasing. [[This was sort of like Cage meets Attali, maybe?]]

Linda Russo next talked about how real material spaces and conditions
influence what gets made. She read from "Secret Silent Plan" and mentioned
Hettie Jones as an example of ... uh, oh, I forget what ... mainly Linda
described the spaces of Buffalo and that became the piece. [[Gary: I think
Hettie Jones was mentioned as part of a thread about gender inequity during
the Beat period. But, yes, most of the talk was about the literal space of
the University of Buffalo.]]

Rachel Cunningham spoke next on poetry slams, saying "nothing is really
absolute in anything I say" (join the club). She described how slams work
and asserted that "slams make poetry into music videos." She said she wants
to create a non-competitive theatrical poetics distinct from the slam world.
"Peacock feathers with peacock feathers." [[Gary: This talk sparked a
conversation in the van on the way back: everyone talked about how they'd
fared in various slams.]]

Adeena Karasick surprised everyone next by launching into a rhythmic
performative burst of a poem that was her poetics and a poetics that was her
poem. Some representative lines: "feel my cantabile billowing" "zipless
variants" " the buxom bust of throaty fetters" " the hegemony of labial
maybes." Jack Kimball's comment: "shameless." [[Gary: True, or as Jordan
said, very Mae Westian. I've seen Adeena read maybe four or five times
before this, and - though the reading style was similar to the earlier
readings -- I was genuinely surprised by this one.]]

Joe Elliot metaphoricized his poetics as his son's various "useless"
construction projects, of which he'd brought a number of photographs. His
son Leo had said of a machine he'd made, "It doesn't do anything, Dad, do
you want to help?" The analogy to poetry was " the supple artefact of the
joy that the writer encounters while making it." I loved this. He tore apart
the yuppified capitalist metaphor of a poem being "successful": "Poems don't
work, Alelulia!" "Get out of the way," he advised. "Usually, the thread's
sonic." I really did love this forcefully expressed, funny, concise
presentation, although I disagree that poems are useless. They have many
uses, one of the most important of which is to make connections, linguistic
and social ... but I won't go on with this as I really hoped to keep
authorial commentary to a minimum here. [[Gary: I'm fading here - I mean
writing this, now - but I want to chime in and say that one of the things I
loved about this talk - my favorite of this panel -- was just how nonchalant
Joe was in talking about poetics. I felt a real connection between Joe's
poetics, as he talked about them, and his work - which, sadly, he didn't
read at the conference (though I've seen him read a couple times in NYC.)]]

Douglas Rothschild opened his presentation by saying, "Poetry is nice, but
now we're going to make a little machine." He said that his primary rubric
was that one ought to be a 24-hour poet; I realized I believe this, too. A
job, he said, is a thing you do in order to not do that thing for four or
five hours, but being a poet is different, he said, a vocation for which one
must be always on call (my words). He discussed how the others on the panel
fit into his rubric - maybe arguable. He said "everyone's afraid of
standards," and then proceeded to recite his three maxims of the poetry
school of poetry, which I'd heard and argued with before: 1) Poems should be
good. 2) The poet must have a sense of temperance. 3) A poet's first job is
to learn how to edit. These would annoy me a lot, and did when I first heard
them, except that I saw all kinds of loopholes in the language, and Doug
himself pointed some of them out. That is, a poem should be good but it
needn't be. The poet must have a sense of temperance, but needn't
necessarily BE temperate; rather, she might have a sense of temperance if
only in order to be able to violate it. And a poet's first job is to LEARN
HOW to edit - but not necessarily TO EDIT. So I didn't really feel I needed
to object more than with a couple of genial hisses to Doug's proscriptions.
He finally proposed Poetastism, a school of poetry in which "any poetic
techniques generally seen as making poems good are seen by poetasters as
bad." I liked this very much as a possible method, and recognized it in my
own practice sometimes. [[Gary: For some reason Doug singled me out as being
someone who had argued with him about Poems needing to be good last year
when he gave his Poetry School of Poetry talk. I had actually asked him
"good by whose measure?"]] ((Note to append to Gary's note - from Nada: I
was the one who had argued with him last year! At Franco's party! Doug was
totally conflating me and Gary! And we don't even look alike!))

I stopped taking notes here as the set I was to read in was next and I was
very agitated, much more so than usual. It felt like a lot of pressure to
have people coming up to me saying "I'm so looking forward to finally seeing
you read" when I didn't somehow that day feel very connected to my poems or
to my body even really. So I tried to focus on my breathing. Aaron came up
to me at the beginning of the set and told me the order had changed, Gerrit
Lansing and Ken Irby wanted to be numbers one and two so would I mind going
last and I said no I guess not. Here's what I remember of the set. Gerrit
Lansing was pretty wonderful, with numerology and sex. Ken Irby reminded me
of my father with a basso voice and much gravity, kind of a square head.
Mitch Highfill also low in the voice read his terrific poem about son
Jackson we published in the Eat Village Poetry Web: "Jackson confuses
popsicle, icicle, and testicle." Also his complex poem "Rat Pack": "bodying
forth." Adeena Karasick read with her characteristic waves of femme fatale
dynamism. Gary Sullivan I can't speak objectively about as he mostly read
letter-poems to me ... he seemed very with his poems rhythmically and I
remember admiring his cute haircut (done by yours truly) and getting
nervouser. I think I might have the order wrong here. (Later Gary confirmed
this -it's all jumbled up -- but I'll leave what I've got here to illustrate
how intensely disoriented I was at this point.) I don't have the schedule
right here. Forgive me. Then? Brendan Lorber brimming with odd little
poems - he read a hilarious list of titles -- and deadpan humor, in a green
Nepali shirt, his face a mask - how does he do it? Especially funny his
penis poem and his last poem a series of letters to various popular
magazines, linked in narrative. Then came Eddie Berrigan in a beautiful
yellow shirt with red cherry blossoms (!!!) ; he read some short poems - one
about tulips -- and then a chapter from his novel. I was up next with some
opera. I sang two songs with poems sandwiched between. I don't know
objectively how I was although some people told me I was great and others
told me I fucked up. Onstage I felt confused and exhausted but kind of
powerful too, at least when I was singing. After my reading a man came up to
me and asked me in a thick accent if I was Jewish and I said yeah why and he
said because Jewish women are so ... I don't remember the adjective but it
was something like 'expressive' ... and you see he was Jewish, from Russia,
so I took no umbrage at the stereotype and now mention this only to make
this narrative vaguely circular. [[Gary: The order of the above was actually
Gerrit, Ken, Brendan, me, Mitch, Adeena, Eddie, Nada, not that it matters
much, except that I had to follow Brendan, who gave what was one of the
funniest readings I've ever seen. I remember a great Irby line: "The flag
inside the flag." But, mostly, like Nada, I was exhausted and nervous. Mitch
read a fantastic piece called "Rat Pack," which Stephen Ellis published as a
one of the Boston Conference Oasis Broadsides. Adeene read a couple poems
from Dysemia Sleaze, as well as from some of her earlier books - I think it
was pretty much the same poems she had read at the Project earlier in the
year. One poem, my favorite, was written after a recent trip to India, and
is filled with inter? intra? lingual puns. Eddie read this one passage from
his novel-in-progress that I remember him reading before, too - it's filled
with repetition, lines that repeat themselves completely, that reappear as
you're going along, "moving forward," and sort of mess with how a novel is
supposed to move. Nada sang beautifully and read powerfully, even though, as
she said later, ,she was "out of her mind." I know she had a fever the whole
time, so I believe her. We had an argument later about the performance, but
it was mostly because we were both exhausted. I was stupidly trying to
engage her in a discussion about her performance, and about ideas about
performance and self-revealing, and so on, AT THE SAME TIME I WAS ALSO
CHASTIZING HER FOR BEING KIND OF MEAN TO ME IN HER FEVERISH STATE. Not mean,
really, but not nice either, and I was a bit hurt, and we wound up arguing
about pretty much everything from What Is Performance? to What Color Are
Bluebirds? or whatever. It's all okay, now, though, and more importantly,
though she might not believe me, Nada changed the way I'd been thinking
about performance, at least for the present.]]

Anyway we had to leave five minutes after my reading, because Tracy was
driving back to New York. This time the riders were Eddie Berrigan, Brenda
Coultas, Lee Ann Brown, Adeena Karasick, Gary and me. Tracy told us about
her former job as a male impersonator: she was Axl Rose and Jim Morrison,
among others! I remember Lee Ann and Brenda talking po-biz and Lee Ann
telling a funny story about how when she was in elementary school she had an
imaginary boyfriend named Lance she kept in a box in her desk! We stopped at
a McDonald's on the way back. Lee Ann got a call on her cell phone while we
were there and we almost -unintentionally - drove off without her: scary!
There was a CD of the Velvet Underground playing; I enjoyed singing along,
especially to "I'll be Your Mirror." Most of the way back I slept with my
head on Gary's knee. It was strange after all that to get dropped off on
Thompson street and see walking past us a very tall, buxom woman in a faded
blonde wig and French maid's costume. I'll stop here.

Hi everyone!

In keeping with Ken Sherwood's recent question regarding "A"-8, I want to put
another Zukofsky query into play:  I'm writing a biography of LZ, and would be
*very* interested in hearing (backchannel of course) from anyone who attended
his summer session course at San Francisco State College back in 1958, or who
knows of someone (and that someone's address) who did.

And of course, I'm always interested in any personal encounters with,
correspondence with, or general gossip about Zukofsky.

Many thanks,

Mark, you might want to get in touch with Barry Ahearn at Tulane University
(if you haven't already).  He did a book on Z and might have access to some
of what you need.  I studied with him there back in the day and found him
helpful.  Best, Bill

I don't know who the list-members from Spain are; perhaps they want to
maintain their privacy. I do know something about the scene there--

I was in Spain recently giving a summer course on Spanish poetry in Almer=EDa=
.
Never a stranger to controversy, as the clich=E9 goes, I had published an
article (summer 99) in the "Hispanic Review" that was a fairly harsh
critique of a group of Spanish poets grouped around the title "la poes=EDa de
la experiencia."  These poets propose a return to a kind of Audenesque tone
and declare the end of the avant-garde.

It is rare that an academic article written in English and published in a
specialized journal in the US gets noticed in Spain.  However, my article
was widely circulated among Spanish poets hostile to the "poes=EDa de la
experiencia"--hence the invitation to participate in this course.  It was
quite bizarre to be giving a press conference in a hotel a few yards from a
beach in Spain:  noone in the USA cares what I think about anything (nor
should they!).  It so happened that some poets that I had criticized were i=
n
the same hotel, giving their own course on Spanish poetry.  I received some
strange looks.  It was a bit like waking up suddenly to realize you are a
character in the novel you have been reading.

The poets whose work I admire can found, mostly, in a magazine called "La
alegr=EDa de los n=E1ufragos" published by Amalia Iglesias and C=E9sar Antonio
Molina.  There is almost nothing of interest available in English, a
situation I am trying to remedy as a reluctant translator.  I'm talking
about the past twenty years of poetry.  There are dozens of editions of
Lorca in print, of course...    =20

In answer to the questionaire a friend was distributing -- Name ten good
books -- Freud replies that he understands "good" as meaning 'like a good
friend', that is, someone whose work you are not intimidated by (with awe,
etc), nor feel in any sense 'superior' to. Had he understood "good" in
some other way, Freud says his list would have been very different: so:
"good" as distinct from "great," "most significant," etc. etc.
        Curiously, Freud's understanding of "good" purposefully excludes
poetry. He writes, "Genuinely creative writing of purely poetical value
has been excluded from this [Freud's] list . . .  because . . . [the
phrase] good books . . . did not seem exactly aimed at such . . . I must
set 'goodness' far above beauty: 'edification' above aesthetic enjoyment."

Kevin Davies has a line in his new book somewhere that goes *something*
like (I don't have his book here, so could be getting it very wrong),
Don't trust your poet-friends to tell you whether your work is good or
not.

I know an absolutely  loving couple whose *sole* serious unresolvable
arguments are only ever about poetry.

Nada and Gary : I very much appreciate the comprehensive report on the
Boston Conference. Made me wish to have been present. So many names who are
still only names to me I wish could be persons (to me). Then, the names I
know as persons, gladdened by their mention to imagine in fresh alignments
with each other some for a first time. Happy to read you are reading Steve
Benson, long in exile from SF, but met up with in Maine last month--SB one
of our finest poets and at the same time, conjecturists of poetry, and one
I consider essential to read over and over. Dear friend also Ken Irby (we
met in was it 1962!?) of whose reading I should have liked to learn more,
dense mysteries of poems increasingly so with the kind years. I appreciate
the comments occasioned by Creeley's appearance, how persons of such
consistency can impress as imitating themselves i.e. "doing a creeley"
which calls the big questions regarding identity out of their cages once
more. And on & on, would love to see Lee Ann's video of it all......

A propos this,

the maid's spare outfit went missing.  We had hoped we had 'cured' him of
these episodes.

A young man handcuffed crucifixion style to a cell door. The screams and
moans of young women echoing through the cell block C. Another young woman
dragged naked, bloody through a garbage strewn prison hall.  Hunger strikers
denied access to water or toilets.  Metal handcuffs pounding, smashing the
fingers, hand and wrist of prisoners who refuse to be finger printed.

These are the scenes reported by eyewitnesses from Philadelphia's central
prison, the Roundhouse, on Friday morning, August 4th.  As the Republican
Party National Convention left town, over four hundred men and women
remained in jail, many for the fourth day.  Their bails range from $6,000 to
$30,000. One man was given a bail of $450,000.  Two people, including Ruckus
Society founder John Sellers, are being held on bail of one million dollars.

Their crime?

They were among thousands of people who mobilized in Philadelphia this week
to confront and challenge the corporate controlled power structure at the
appointment of Republican Presidential candidate George W Bush.

Free Speech TV has been in Philadelphia all week, providing live television
broadcast from the Independent Media Center.  All the news that the
corporate media censors.  Each morning an expanded two hour telecast of
Pacifica Radio's Democracy Now! with Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzales has
examined the issues and interviewed the young men and women who have dared
disrupt the festivities of the powerful.  Each evening, Crashing the
Party! - an hour and a half report on the day's events, hosted by Radio for
Change's Laura Flanders has told the real stories of their creative
challenges and Philadelphia's brutal response.

Free Speech TV's coverage can be seen on Dish Network Channel 9415 and has
been carried live on over 30 Public Access cable stations around the
country.  It has also been streamed live and archived at www.freespeech.org.

You can visit our website to get a Dish Network Satellite so that you can
follow our coverage as we move to the Independent Media Center in Los
Angeles on August 14th -18th to cover the mobilizations that will confront
the Democratic Party at the coronation of Al Gore.

We need your support to continue this unprecedented coverage. Please

BRUTAL TREATMENT CONTINUES AGAINST JAILED PROTESTERS

UNPRECEDENTED CRACKDOWN HIGHLIGHTS SYSTEMATIC ATTACK ON DEMOCRATIC
PRINCIPLES OF PEACEFUL PROTEST AND PEOPLE OF CONSCIENCE

Philadelphia, PA ~ On the last day of the Republican National Convention, in
Philadelphia, the cradle of democracy, police and federal authorities have
demonstrated a determination to undermine both the US Constitution and
people's basic human rights. Jailed demonstrators continue to demand medical
treatment, access to lawyers, access to phones, and timely release. Outside,
solidarity actions continue, with rallies planned at Franklin Park at 7 p.m.

Guards, police, and administrators continue to attack protestors in jail,
seeking to demoralize and divide. Recently released prisoners have reported
eyewitness accounts of widespread abuse that can only be described as
torture. There are numerous accounts of arrestees who have been isolated,
verbally abused, punched, kicked, thrown against walls, bloodied, and
dragged naked across floors, in one instance through a 'trash trough'
containing refuse, spittle and urine. There has been a reported sexual
assault by a female officer who pulled and twisted a prisoner's penis. Seven
witnesses saw one woman dragged naked and bleeding. Diabetics, epileptics,
and asthmatics continue  to be denied medication. Trauma and psychological
stress are evident.

Paul Davis, from ACT UP Philadelphia, reports his eyewitness accounts of
brutality inside the Philadelphia jail. "I saw a man handcuffed to his cell
door in a crucifixion position. I heard women screaming and being dragged
along the floor. I saw a woman screaming in pain as a police officer said,
'You want more?! You want more?!'"

Arrestees have now been held for over 60 hours without arraignment, some
without phone calls or contact with their lawyers. Detainees report missing
paperwork, and arraignments with incomplete or slipshod records.
Philadelphia continues to restrict R2K Legal Committee lawyers, allowing
only a total of three lawyers access to all six detention sites, and
hundreds of defendants. Prosecutors have set unprecedented high bail for
non-violent civil disobedience. Most bails range from $15,000 to $30,000,
while others are much higher. Two individuals have bail of $1,000,000, an
amount typically reserved for serial killers, not community organizers,
non-violence training facilitators artists and puppet makers charged with
misdemeanors.

"I consider this a civil rights catastrophe of the first order," R2K Legal
Committee counsel Ron McGuire stated. "This is an attack on our 14th
Amendment. An attack on due process and reasonable bail." "This is a
systematic political effort to undermine and destroy the momentum of a
growing movement for social and environmental justice."

R2K Legal has documented 381 confirmed arrests, not including members of the
International Action Center and School of Americas Watch (15 more).
Additionally, there are people we have not heard from (we estimate up to
30), but due to restrictions on protester's access to telephones, there is
really no way to tell. Of these people, approximately 60 have accepted
"Release on Own Recognizance" or "Signed On Bail." Prisoners are working
together to agree on and communicate their demands. Solidarity tactics to
demand their release include singing, chanting, and story telling, along
with a 150-person-strong hunger strike. Some have been on hunger strike for
as long as 56 hours. Three men have fasted without water for 28 hours.

Supporters are asked to phone Mayor John Street at 215.686.2181 and demand
the immediate release of these  political prisoners.

Notes on "Red Roses for Bronze" (CP: 209 - 305) /

On the function of the poet / of poetry / rejection / isolation / in
unrequited love / and need for spirituality / HD sculpts her love in bronze
/ shaping the contours and wandering curves / belittled, mocked by cynic
curls worn / by a light and free intellect / imprisioned by her gaze /

"With stroke, / stroke, / stroke, / stroke, / stroke at-something" (211)
melts with welcome / HD's careworn emotions sliding layers over one another,
sediment falling to the sea-bed as her wishes, her images spin lazy down the
page / how easily am I caught by red roses caught in bronze / when
exasperated, a little breath is lost / "that I would prove too strange, too
proud, / for just the ordinary sort of come and go, / the little half-said
thing, / the half-caught smile," (211-2) / the incredulity of "forgot?
impossible," (212) / quiet, contemplative, plaintive - a woman, fiercly
independent / but desire has pulled despair out of the ravine / that
separates by a marble stair / of love denied / of gaze fallen upon the
muscle concealed beneath fine weave / her desire surges forth "I feel that I
must turn and tear and rip" (213) / in her frustration - she longs to flail
forth - to make him aware of her singularity among women / treat my
exception with honour /

A scenario is built in IV / would you meet me "to-day - / tomorrow will not
do at all;" (213) / HD's discomfort makes my fingers ache as they dance over
the keys / why the aching pain inside me / nags me, pushes fears forward /
my faith in writing ever nearer the marble stair / of alienation and
misunderstanding / without the complete picture / how can I proceed? /

Encircled by light caught in a tangle of serpents, HD slips into a rapture /
bewitched by his hair / his eyes, flecked with pounamu glint / and we are
swept by her adoring gaze / grasping the ineffable essence which words
attempt to imprision / her love, who is as distant as the stars, as Mars, or
Actaeon / as avatar of Artemis, the Huntress / buried beneath the hounds of
desire, despair and desolation / Artemis's own, not his own / did HD wish
she would be stumbled on - in a cavern - to find Actaeon caught in surprise
at Artemis's sudden beauty / as she bathed / only to have her call his own
hounds upon his transcendence from hunter into hunted / that sudden betrayal
of purpose / of desire revealed all too late / when wounds bleed for too
long / in mis-deed, retribution is swift / even the crime of inattention /

And did Artemis deliberately lose her race / did she cast her face / so that
the dappled light beneath oak trees / flickered with irony over the freed
mystery / of allure, so deep and still that all men are ensnared by her
visage / in all her honesty - all her forthright pride - her solid sense of
worth / so that she seethes in jealousity, in hate, and in love spited /
spiritedly sings "I would clear so fiery a space / that no mere woman's love
could long endure; / and I would set your bronze head in its place, / about
the base, / my roses would endure," (215) / as she knows that her own is
eternity / her red rose in brazen words sprint ever forth / outwards and
upwards through time / the flame always one step ahead of ashes and dust /
all that is left of these of lesser spirit / where is the earthy ideal /
deal la ma!

Esprint activated / 21 electrodes tingling in the sudden vacuum / auditory
relief / back into the formless / bone conducting vibrations from each bone
- a nerve relay / no perceptible delay in response between nature and
machine / sound meshes with vibro-sense / I listen to HD - she continues, a
poem may also be a microcosm for a book / and "Red Roses for Bronze" circles
and penetrates these themes / HD, a dancing matador goading her malcontence
/ HD finds a certain liberation in the expression of sensuous image and
ritual / in a love which is transcendent / " is a trap, / a snare ) /a bird
lifed a passionless wing; / nothing, nothing was ever so fair / as the
wonder that clutched at me there, / unaware; under the rain; my brain sang"
(217) / in this refrain, too easy to grasp at this / and say 'HD knows the
pain of indifferent beauty; of the besotted vision which finds sumptuous
wonder in the most starved of gesture' / while this is not quite simplex,
does it go deep enough into complexity to be called multiplex? /

One often finds darkness in the depths / and "Red Roses for Bronze" ends
with 'The Mysteries' / a poem which begins its six sections in dark days /
gloomy spirits, turbulent earth / then breaks the permafrost with the first
flower of the season / at the cusp of her love lost / comes love renewed /
with spring in step, it's hard not to lift your head / and smell your
bouquet / a sceptre / a flower / enchanter / magician / arch-mage /
escalating magics running across the moor to greet the stripped, fevered
warrior / its purpose? "Not to destroy, / nay, but to sanctify" (303&304).

My feeling is that this dimension of HD's work reflects but one facet of her
nature / and nature is the key / nature transcends human failings / while
the pangs echo endlessly down corridors / "the air / will be full of
multiple wings;" (218) / again, and again, HD turns away from the frailities
of other humans to these long gone myths the Greeks stole from Kemet - but
whose essence lives on, in the history of the tale / HD's voice runs now
quick, "Who is there, / who is there in the road?" (223), now lifted by
endorphins "again shall my pulses beat / like the deer / escaped from the
net," (226), now melancholy "Hard, / hard it is to wake the gods, / but
once awake, / hard, / hard, / hard is the lot / of the ignorant man," (227)
/ Our own ignorance struggles with HD / in a world where words have become
kaleidoscopic / where grammar has lost its importance / overwhelmed by the
sound-bite / where classical no longer means white european achievement /
but tradition in all its multitude / where the Greeks sample Africa / the
persistent, constant use of Greek mythology to accentuate / imposes
http://longman.awl.com/mythology/glossaries/default.asp upon the reader /
even as "Orion bent / to shelter Artemis;" (261) and is slain for his pains
and thereafter his dance across the sky is chased by the scorpion /

The heavy elements melt into air

brutal, protocols of enforcement
with spectacular diversions, briefings

SUBPRESS WINS AWARD
FROM ACADEMY OF AMERICAN POETS

Author:     Scott Bentley
Title:      The Occasional Tables

Length:     88p
Price:      $10

Subpress announces the publication of Scott Bentley's first
collection of poems, entitled The Occasional Tables.  This
book was one of four to receive a grant from the Greenwall
fund of The Academy of American Poets.  Bentley lives in
Oakland, CA, and teaches writing at Cal State Hayward,
negotiating the East Bay hills in his wheelchair. His work
has appeared in a number of small magazines, as well as
three chapbooks.

The Occasional Tables is a collection of lyric poems
written over the past decade.  Each poem is written to a
specific person for a specific event.  Some of the poems
stand alone and some are written as discrete series.  Yet
taken as a whole, "they resonate in a complex way to the
poetical as a worldly category, obligated to personal and
political unease as well as pleasure. The book is,
in this sense, full of life." (Hejinian)

Or as Alex Cory says remarks:

"I'd have called this an 'important' book, except in its wake
importance doesn't count for anything. All that could
possibly count is writing a poem for someone you care
about, and if it could stand up to that, be useful, like these
poems by Scott Bentley, poems that need to personally
operate in the midst of a life, in the midst of a marriage--
a real love poem, written for someone, for Marta, to make
poetry become capable of that, of making so small, and so
actual, of a gesture . . ."

Subpress books are available from Small Press Distribution
and directly from the publisher.  Desk and review copies
are available.

Subpress is a collective that is supported by nineteen
members who have agreed to donate 1% of their yearly
income for three years. Each person is responsible for
editing one book. Subpress operates under the `A`A Arts
umbrella, a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation. `A`A Arts has
received grants from the NEA, The Academy of American
Poets, NYSCA, HCM, & the UH Diversity & Equity Fund
to do local programming and publishing, yet we continue to
be in need of funds. Consider becoming a donor.
Remember, only you can prevent the extinction of

>From the Back Cover

Remarkable intricacies of intelligence are at play in Scott
Bentley's wonderful new book, the result of thought's
occurring at maximal velocity without impatience. It
evolves with the intensity of what might be termed a
musical passion; the writing is precise and the effect is
enormous.  And it is not only in this respect that one might
cite the work of Louis Zukofsky as that of a predecessor,
since the poetical, for Bentley as for Zukofsky, is a worldly
category and obligated to personal and political unease as
well as pleasure. It is, in this sense, full of life. This is a
book of enormous seriousness and complex resonance. I
have read it with care and joy, and I expect to read it many
times again.
    -Lyn Hejinian


Scott Bentley is loud and clear and on fire cumulatively.
Now we all get to sit down together at the eating table of
language occasions. Bentley's abstract menu begins with a
poem containing some of the most phonemetrically erotic
phrases ever invented. What better way for a poem to be
but for somebody. Grammar flutters & fucks in the dust
"beyond a yell of water" but does not muddy its conjugal
thrust. These are love poems to every body, generously
sifted through vectors of grace, exploded.
    -Lee Ann Brown


>Author Bio

Scott Bentley was born in Burbank, California, in 1964.
Paralyzed from the waist down, childhood was spent
mostly in hospitals as he underwent twelve operations in
about as many years to repair a defected spine and hips.
Childhood memories include the sight of countless balsa
wood airplanes stuck in trees, the early morning sound of
an outboard motor as a tiny aluminum boat carrying
grandson and gramps headed out to sea, and the words of
"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?" In southern
California on streets named for varieties of avocados Scott
grew up amidst the enduring conflict and broken furniture
of parents who were married too young. As soon as he was
able, he left home for college to study writing and received
a BA from UC Santa Cruz in 1986 and an MA from UC
San Diego in 1988. Since then he has been living with his
spouse in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he teaches
writing at CSU Hayward. His work has appeared in
Chinquapin, Idiom, The Impercipient, Lyric&,
Mirage#4/Period(ical), & The Raddle Moon. His
publications include GROUND AIR (O Books, 1994),
OUT OF HAND (Parenthesis, 1989) & EDGE (Birdcage,
1986).


>From the foreward

    In 1989, on my 25th birthday, I threw a party for
myself and invited all of my poet friends to celebrate at my
grandmother's house, where I was living at the time. My
presence in the house helped my grandmother to fill up the
echoing hollow left after my grandfather passed, and my
grandmother, as part of my grandfather's legacy, helped to
shepherd me through graduate school at UC San Diego.
    In attendance at this bash were some famous and
some not so famous poets: some just now, a decade later,
coming into a bit of recognition; some continuing to toil in
obscurity; and some having moved on to other occupations,
other worlds. Though I am no longer in contact with many
of these writers, each one of them, whether in a classroom
or huddled around a Royal typewriter while working all
night on some collaborative project, helped to shape the
writer I have become. It has been my utmost privilege to
have been acquainted with each of them and their work.
This book, in large part, attempts to acknowledge my debt
to those and other writers I have known, who by serendipity
met and contrived to hazard some semblance of community
of individuals intensely and variously interested in one
thing: language.
    During the evening of that long ago birthday party,
one particular poet, Fanny Howe, gave to me as a present a
poem that she had written. Though the poem itself is now
tucked away in a box somewhere in my attic, the edges of
the paper yellowing among the many other scraps and
mementos collected from my school days, I can still
remember exactly the sense of breathless fluster that I felt
at having a poem written just for me, typed and folded and
sealed in a brightly colored envelope. It was on that night, I
think, that I happened upon the idea for this book that you
now find before you.
    Over the past decade, the poems in this volume
were all written for particular people on particular
occasions. Sometimes I would, say, be aware that
someone's birthday was coming up, so I would write that
friend or relative a poem; sometimes I would write a poem
while holding in mind only the vaguest impression of a
certain person, maybe after having only just met him or her;
and sometimes, I must admit, I would write a poem and
then assign it to a particular person for dedication, long
after the piece was written; and sometimes forlorn, ah, a
valentine. No matter the particulars of a given writing
situation, in nearly every case, I would then give the poem
to the person, whenever the time seemed appropriate to do
so, sometimes in the form of a small hand-made chapbook
printed ornately on exquisite paper.
    While you read these poems I ask you to keep one
or two things in mind. If none of the poems in the volume
point to you as the beloved, I hope you can, just the same,
read and enjoy all the poems as if each one had been
written for you, as if a lovelorn arrow had been flung
straight toward your brave forehead. If a particular poem
does however bear your name and you've never seen it
before, surprise! And if a poem bears your name and you
are tempted to feel something, congratulations! It is not
often we are permitted such moments of grace.
    Any perceived breach of confidence is strictly
accidental, the car careening over the guard rail, blind-
sided. As Fanny Howe writes "Where I am is one thing, but
where I am NOT is bigger." In the end, intentionality still
gets us Iliads of camellias, ladies, strewn across the
periodic table.
    It goes without saying that the poems and the words
out of which they are made are objects. If a particular poem
is dedicated to you, the poem as a fact is meant as a gift. If I
had been a carpenter, I would have built you a house, but I
am a poet. Gathering the materials I have before me, I
wrote a few poems for some of those people in my life
whom I have known, loved and continue to admire. The
risk in such a project, one so apparently personal, is that the
poems will have their inevitable referents-every word,
phrase, line and sentence will imply larger meanings in this
world of words. Language and memory and experience
conflate. It is possible that a particular reader may find
some of this slippage uncomfortable or disturbing. None of
us has any control over any of this and I am sorry.
    The poems should be thought of as tiny and endless,
their music meant to delight with decoration the vaults of
the imagination. In this sense, I hope you can enjoy this
book a little; if not, winter is coming. I invite you on the
coldest day of the year to take a match to this book's pages,
so that at least it will serve to warm your house if it cannot
warm your heart.

>Sample Poems


With Nothing Underneath

    -for Marta

scantily panty, my
plenty empty

puny:  oh, your pale
pilsner, your shady

prissy, my lissome
transom pretty:    suspend

me unattended, my saucy
cedilla:        askance the sea

saw suckling streams
my pendulum compendium



Castaways

    -for Jennifer, a valentine

    If you woke one morning to find the body sleeping
next to you a shindig of party favors, a polyester cocktail
on your fine suit;

    if I lived a thousand years, happily
ever after never having had
you to do all over
again;

    if you'd been the Skipper, I'd be your
Marianne or Ginger, of course,
this clearly being a case

of mistaken indemnity, neither
of us meant anything much to the other

by it, so
we said . . .

and yet, I would have liked to rescue you from all that
network variety, navigating
the orange and pink Day-glo that Providence channels,
tossing off covers
up such transgressions you searched
the lagoon, the dawning

    on land
    snakes, alive.

so i was doing some research on stuff (i'm teaching a sort of "other"
englishes classes this semester; or i'm supposed to but it might not
make b/c when the university deregistered all the students who hadn't
paid yet last week my class dropped down to 11 students) this summer b/c
i was in ny where they have books in their libraries (the UH one has
been cut to smithereens and it is the only one on the island; plus it
suffers from usual colonial buying habits--it seems to have bought
practically no caribbean literature; very little african lit other than
the usual suspects; almost none of the lit in scots, etc.). but nyc has
this great schomberg center where they seem to have almost everything
i've ever seen mentioned in caribbean literature. i spent an exciting
few days up there.

but anyway, i was looking for this ken saro-wiwa poem that was written
in a sort of other english ("dis nigeria sef"). i found it at the
library on microfilm. it was in a chapbook, i think, called _songs in a
time of war_ and came out in 1985. "dis nigeria sef" is long and
complicated (but it is well worth reading) so i'm not going to talk
about it but the book opens with this great revision of sappho that blew
me away:

VOICES

They speak of taxes
Of oil and power

They speak of honour
And pride of tribe

They speak of war
Of bows and arrows

They speak of tanks
And putrid human flesh

I sing my love
For Maria.

I've just received word that Dudley Randall, legendary founder and publisher of Detroit's Broadside Press, has passed away.  After working with Margaret Danner and others in the Boone House cultural center, he began Broadside, one of the most widely circulated and influential of African-American presses, in 1965.  When I was a graduate student doing my first research on Melvin B. Tolson, I noticed Randall's phone number on a letter he had sent to Tolson.  Gambling that Randall might still be at the same number 15 years later, I called.  Not only was he there, but he took time to answer my questions and was among the most generous and encouraging of older poets I was to meet in those years.


              Booker T. and W.E.B.

"It seems to me," said Booker T.,
"It shows a lot of cheek
To study chemistry and Greek
When Mister Charlie needs a hand
To hoe the cotton on his land,
And when Miss Ann looks for a cook,
Why stick your nose inside a book?"

"I don't agree," said W.E.B.
"If I should have the drive to seek
Knowledge of chemistry or Greek,
I'll do it.  Charles and Miss can look
Another place for hand or cook.
Some men rejoice in skill of hand,
And some in cultivating land,
But there are others who maintain
The right to cultivate the brain."

"It seems to me," said Booker T.,
"That all you folks have missed the boat
Who shout about the right to vote,
And spend vain days and sleepless nights
In uproar over civil rights.
Just keep your mouths shut, do not grouse,
But work, and save, and buy a house."

"I don't agree," said W.E.B.
"For what can property avail
If dignity and justice fail?
Unless you help to make the laws,
They'll steal your house with trumped-up clause.
A rope's as tight, a fire as hot,
No matter how much cash you've got.
Speak soft, and try your little plan,
But as for me, I'll be a man."

"It seems to me," said Booker T.--

This message has been edited from an original distributed by the author.

                            people arriving at the vortex of the last day
                            write music as naive as God's

- Thunder 1, YI.

     'YI', Yang Lian's most important work, was composed
over five years (1985-89) and later translated by Mabel Lee.
It is now published by Sun and Moon Press, LA, USA.

You can oder it direct from the publishers, through SPD (Small Press
Distribution) in the United States or from amazon.com, etc.

     The structure of 'YI' is based on the 'Yijing' or 'Book of Changes',
re-configured according to by Yang lian's particular interpretation.
64 parts are collected into four larger sections:

     1. The untrammeled man speaks
     2. In symmetry with death
     3. Living in seclusion
     4. The descent

     Seven different poetic forms and three styles of
prose are employed as a major challenge to Chinese language itself,
poetically closed since 1949. They work attempts to explored the great
neglected potential of the language. This one of the things which makes
'YI' an important work for understanding and effecting a modern
transformation of Chinese culture and poetics.

     The title 'YI' in Chinese is a specially created character for the
book.

    Please pass this message on to anyone else you think may be interested.

[John Cayley adds: Yang Lian's collection of shorter poems,
'Non-Person Singular'
and the chapbook of his sequence 'Where the Sea Stands Still' are
still available
from Wellsweep Press. Email me to order.]

dear kevin and all,

i was in philly for the protests, working with the independent media
center, interviewing people with my friend "kk" the camerawoman.  i cant
write much specifically now but the website has loads of info.  i think the
most important thing is the message of the movement - that 1) economic
inequality as a result of IMF/WTO/world bank-style globalizing is leaving
thousands in poverty, frustrated and with a growing sense of little to lose
(hence, i think, the growing numbers of people willing to throw themselves
in harms way) and 2)  there are too many issues people are concerned about
in the US and North America which are not getting anywhere near accurate
coverage, or any coverage at all, from the mainstream, corporate-owned
media.  the activists want to make a space for ALL of these issues to be
foregrounded.  examples which seemed to receive large turnout in phily were
economic inequality, police brutality, the growing prison industrial
complex, threats to education on all levels, and the farcical "democracy"
of our two-look-alike-rotating-figure-headed (they're not so) christian
(or) moral wrong wing.

for great details, photos, stories, video, etc -- Check out
http://www.phillyimc.org

this movement is incredibly well organized, well supported and growing
quite large.  the things i describe here are things that are going on in
every city where the movement is going on.  LA is the next stop, going on
right this minute.  and many of these folks are going to prague for the
next IMF meeting in september.  if you want to say they're all rich folks
who can afford to go to all these things - not quite.  many people are
getting funded by pools of friends, getting rides and roughing it,
borrowing heavily against student loans which they will have to pay back,
or using credit cards likewise.  buses are often chartered to bring people
from far away too.  when people arrive wherever they arrive, locals have
been set up to take them in.  in philly local cooks made vegetarian food
and sold it VERY cheap on-site at various locations.

the independent media center, where i plugged in, for example, was put
together in a rented space and staffed by about 250 volunteers at any given
hour of the day, though records indicate that hundreds more at least
registered with the IMC.  equipment was donated including about 35
computers, a T1 wireless for ethernet connections, the work of producing
the daily print newpaper, lots of software.  the whole thing was set up
about 5 days before the convention began.  people showed up with everything
from personal camcorders to "borrowed" school-owned professional cameras.
a pirate radio station, web radio, web tv and a constantly updated website
have been among the things implemented at the IMC to cover the
counter-conventional activities.  documentary filmmakers, video artists,
poets and writers, many many hackers and other multimedia revolutionaries
have worked day and night to keep the place functional, and keep coverage
up-to-the-minute.  decisions about what stories to present were and are
made democratically by joining the editorial collective and rating stories
as they come in.  anyone at all from anywhere can join the editorial
collective and rate stories.

every day was ruled by bicylces, digital recording and programming devices
and cell phones.  teams would set out with recording equipment and note
pads, while others on bicycles would race around looking for breaking news
which was never hard to find.  cell phones were used to commmunicate to
each other on the street and also to call in live radio broadcasts and/or
inform the website breaking news editor and the dispatch counter.  its
beginning to look a lot like neuromancer.  i finally see the importance of
a laptop and a cell phone.  -- barring time-travel and speed shuttling, the
bicycle is looking better than ever.

other incredible aspects of this movement are that there are hundreds who
have volunteered their legal services to defend and witness for arrested
folks.  they have their own office much like the IMC.  likewise hundreds of
medical folks have donated time and resources to stand by for those who
need medical attention.

various tactics for civil disobedience are being taught in organized
training sessions.  these training sessions are important - as the police
become better trained in how to deal with the new tactics, the tactics have
to change - anyone who wants to do blockades or any other civil
disobedience is strongly urged to attend training sessions BEFORE taking
part in actual, physical activism.

Dear Friends:

I have just reactivated my subscription to this listserve, after a
year-long hiatus which I spent working and travelling way too much. It feels
great to jump back into the discussion, and I look forward to taking part!

I wanted to take a minute just to say hello. I also wanted to announce
that I am in the process of putting together a group here in Boston for
experienced poets to get together and share work. There are already five
of us, and we are looking for a few more like-minded and dedicated people.

If interested, please drop me an email!

Hugs to All,

Suzanne

Just as a quick follow-up to Kristin Gallagher's important post,
I'd like to point out the following article, which I noticed on a
quick visit to the Philly IMC site. It invites people to write
personal letters of support to the 341 remaining arrested (only
one address is given, but more apparently to follow). Note the
"Jane Doe": as I understand it, many or most of those presently
in custody have refused to give their names in an attempt to
stymie the legal process. The harassment they are undergoing
is no doubt intense, and stems from an exercise of political
rights rather than any actual wrong-doing; it is unquestionably
worth 10 minutes and 33 cents even to attempt contact.

For those who can afford to do more than write, there is also
a Bail Fund Appeal underway; details may be had from the
Philadelphia Direct Action Group web site at
<http://www.thepartysover.org/bailfundappeal.html>. Bail has
been set as high as $30,000 for such alleged offenses as the
overturning of trash cans; two protesters have had their bail
set at one million dollars. A further report on the conditions
under which the prisoners are being held can be found at
<http://www.thepartysover.org/media/r2kupdate20000807.html>.

I would also suggest letters - as those I will be writing - to
the Mayor of Philadelphia and his District Attorney. The Mayor's
direct address seems to have been withheld from the city govt.
web site pending the resolution of this affair, but he can be
reached via the "Information and Complaint Office" at

Mayor John F. Street
c/o Renee Grundy, Executive Director
The Mayor's Action Center
City Hall, Room 143
Philadelphia, PA 19107

(215) 686-3000
(215) 686-2250

I tried to locate his home address but was unsuccessful.
As for the D.A., she is:

Lynne Abraham
District Attorney of Philadelphia
1421 Arch Street
Philadelphia, PA 19102-1576

Comments to the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer may
be directed to:

P.O. Box 41705
Philadelphia, Pa. 19101

Tel. 215-854-4543
Fax 215-854-4483

What all of this represents is a chance for those of us
who weren't there, for whatever reason, to take on a
very, very small part of the responsibility of assisting
those who were - and who, in effect, represented us justly
and in good faith. In retaliation for which they have
been jailed, assaulted and unsystematically tortured, denied
medication and other necessary services, denied contact with
their lawyers, denied contact with relatives and friends.
If such makes the Philadelphia police department sound like
the tool of a brutal dictatorship - well, I guess that's not
essentially wrong. "All right we are two nations," advises
John Dos Passos, reminding us it's been less than 75 years
since Sacco and Vanzetti were similarly made welcome.

Support our Political Prisoners
By IF-AID

Dear Comrades,

It is crucial that we let our voices rise above the State's prison walls
and reach the
hearts of our heroes who are being illegally held for daring to voice what
we all believe
in. Our community is one of people meeting people, a solidarity of human
beings. We
must let our brave Political Prisoners in Philly know that we recognize
their sacrifice
and support their courage in standing for Solidarity.

Please take the time and send them a personal letter, let them know they
are not
alone, let them know we will not rest until all of these absurd charges are
dropped and
our brothers & sisters go home.

So send a letter to:

PIC Inmate PP 908052 Jane Doe 021 8301 State Rd. Philadelphia, PA 19136

At the moment I only have one Political Prisoner's numbers. I'll send more
as I get
them. Or if others have the numbers please post them in the comments
section of this
post. Our brave sister's nickname is "Turtle", and I am sure she will
spread your
messages to others in the prison. Please remember all letters are read by
prison
officials!

If one is interested in visiting a comrade they can take NJ Transit to
Holmesburg and
walk to the prison. Each prisoner gets 2 hours a week visiting privileges.
You will need
quarters, ID and will be searched and frisked before entering.

For more information please feel free to contact me.

The Prison phone number is 215-685-8394 (It is called CFCF)

Please distribute this e-mail widely.

Sincerely, Elliott M. Madison R2K Legal/ IF AID Legal

Annual Transcontinental Poetry Award by Pavement Saw Press

Each year Pavement Saw Press will seek to publish at least one book of
poetry and/or prose poems from manuscripts received during this
competition. Selection is made anonymously through a competition that is

open to  anyone who has not previously published a volume of poetry or
prose. The author receives $1000 and a percentage of the press run. The
judge of the competition will not be announced until after the
competition is judged. Last year’s judge was Bin Ramke.

All poems must be original, all prose must be original, fiction or
translations are not acceptable. Writers who have had volumes of poetry
and/or prose under 40 pages printed or printed in limited editions of no

more than 500 copies are eligible. Submissions are accepted during the
months of June, July, and until August 15th.

Entries must meet these requirements:

1. The manuscript should be at least 48 pages and no more than 64 pages
in length.

2. A cover letter which includes a brief biography, the book's title,
your name, address, and telephone number, your signature, and, if you
have e-mail, your e-mail address. It should also include a list of
acknowledgments for the book.

3. The manuscript should be bound with a single clip and begin with a
title page including the book's title, your name, address, and telephone

number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address. Submissions to the

contest are judged anonymously.

4. The second page should have only the title of the manuscript. There
are to be no acknowledgments or mention of the author's name from this
page forward.

5. A table of contents should follow the second title page.

6. The manuscript should be paginated, beginning with the first page of
poetry.

7. There should be no more than one poem on each page. The manuscript
can contain pieces that are longer than one page.

Your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $15.00

(US) made payable to Pavement Saw Press. All US contributors to the
contest will receive at least one book provided a self addressed 9 by 12

envelope with $3.20 postage is provided. Add appropriate postage for
other countries. For acknowledgment of the manuscripts arrival, please
include a stamped, self-addressed postcard. For notification of results,

enclose a SASE business size envelope. A decision will be reached in

"dooglits"? George didnt tell me those were his _dooglits_ ! Was that a
word of yours, Louis Cabri, or was it being x-posted from another List?
Looks like your entire post is in quotes, or rather, was being lifted from
elsewhere, with its little > s prefacing every line.  I do hope only one
poetics List has read that I lick the dooglits of noted poets. Otherwise,
my inbox will be flooded with requests!

And I won't even know where to begin, not knowing what a dooglit is.....

Internet Security Systems Security Alert
August 7, 2000

Brown Orifice, BOHTTPD, a Platform Independent Java Vulnerability in
Netscape

Synopsis:

On August 5th, code was made public by Dan Brumleve, which demonstrates a
serious security hole in the Netscape Java distribution. This vulnerability
allows a hostile web site to start a server process on the browser system.
That server can access arbitrary files on the browser system and locally
connected networks through "file:" URLs. All versions of Netscape Navigator
and Netscape Communicator versions 4.74 and earlier are vulnerable when Java
is enabled. Mozilla from mozilla.org is not currently vulnerable. Preview 1
of Mozilla from Netscape (Netscape 6 Preview 1) is expired and cannot be
tested.
Microsoft Internet Explorer is not vulnerable at this time.

Impact:

A hostile web server can start a server process on the browser system with
no warning to the browsing user. This process can access any file on the
local (browser) machine or the locally connected network through normal file
sharing, if it is accessible by the browsing user. Additional code and
external URLs can also be distributed by the running server, resulting in
self-propagation and feedback to the hostile site.

Affected Versions:

Netscape Communicator 4.74 and earlier with Java and downloadable plugins
enabled. Netscape Navigator 4.74 and earlier with Java and downloadable
plugins enabled.

Affected Platforms:

All platforms on which Java and Netscape are available are vulnerable. This
is a platform independent exploit. Systems running Windows 2000, Windows NT
and Linux are known to be vulnerable through demonstration.

Unaffected Platforms:

Microsoft Internet Explorer is not currently affected.
Mozilla is not currently affected.
Browsers with Java disabled are not affected.

Description:

Upon execution from a hostile web page, a hostile Java applet downloads a
set of socket classes permitting it to create a web server within the
Browser Java runtime environment. Through the use of the socket class, the
exploit code listens on a configurable port number (the default port is
8080, the httpd proxy port). Through the use of "file:" URLs, this hostile
server code is capable of accessing any local files, including any network
files that can be reached, through file sharing, from the local file system.

The origination site contains clear warnings that this code is a security
vulnerability, but nothing in the nature of this exploit requires a warning
to the user from the browser. Like any other Java applet, this can run with
no execution warning.

The origination page also does not fully describe the sample exploit
server's behavior. In addition to starting up a web server, the pages
delivered by the web server contain image references back to the originating
host. Any browsers that connect to a compromised system reveal themselves to
the origination site.  This introduces the possibility for further
propagation of similar exploits, through redirection or references to the
hostile code from the hostile server itself. Self-propagating versions of
this exploit have not been observed at this time.

The origination site contains a "BOHTTPD_spy" page containing a list of
sites known to have executed the code. This list is being actively exploited
by other sites around the world, which are attempting to browse or break
into the compromised sites. Some of these attempts appear to be automated,
while many appear to be simple manual browsing. These sites may be unaware
that their own efforts to browse the compromised sites are being revealed to
the origination site, along with the IP address and port that they are
browsing.

Fix Information:

No fix is available from Netscape as of this writing.

Recommendations:

Until a fix becomes available, Java should be disabled in the browser.
Disabling the "downloader plugin" can also prohibit the downloading of the
required socket classes that this exploit requires for operation.

Additional Information:

Code available from http://www.brumleve.com/BrownOrifice includes Java
source code for the sample exploit that could be readily modified for more
malicious use.

Information about this exploit appeared on several popular web sites
including SlashDot, days before appearing on BugTraq. It can be assumed that
knowledge of the exploit, its source code, and variations are widespread.

While Mozilla, at this time, does not appear to be vulnerable, this appears
to be due to an error attempting to locate the "downloader plugin". This
situation could change with release or configuration.

No other browsers are known to be vulnerable at this time.

A RealSecure signature for the following data will detect someone
downloading the BOHTTPD.class:

Context: URL_Data
String: .*BOHTTPD\.class

If this class is renamed, this signature will no longer be effective.

I have to say that I dont know what they are, either, and unlike Mr
Bromige, I dont want to know. But I can tell you this: if I wanted
anyone to have a go at my dooglits, it would be Mr Bromige.

Listmates, ten days up north at Bowering Manor, shooting the grouse (or
trying to--the grouse,a distant relative, is good at hiding). After dinner,
Ludo in the Lounge until Exhaustion. There's to be no Licking of the
Dooglits, I hear. So I'll miss you all, in the still of the night. But
eventually comes dawn, followed by all that Canadian bacon. MM-mmm!

Structure of the World-Order


Electronic commerce (e-business) is characterized by world-wide transac-
tions between one country and the rest of the world, over a globalization
climate for cultural export (world-music for markets). Hedge funds are
correlated; a panic in one part of the world affects everyone. Supply more
than 40 per cent of the world's oil, own about 78 per cent of the world's
total reserves!

Transactions between one country and the rest of the world, including
transportation, utilities, shelter, medical care, among other things, but
not transfers such as unemployment on a trans-national level. Various
indices are used in macroeconomic analysis, including the transportation
or agricultural sector. Also used in the sense of the public of the world.

Movements among moving borders in one world-part across others, nations
transferring funds through chaebol or keiretsu banking conglomerates
shifting across continental boundaries. World-wide current-account and
gold on the movement, investments moving shares in restructuring systemic
crises. World-grid shuddering across world-grid, currency valuations
floating pegged to nominal flows of foreign low-risk shares of sponsored
ADR. Jostling and adjustments, record low unemployment levels after tax-
ation and tracking-rates. Almost no one present for crisis compensation,
currency on the move.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;

Is this America?  Unfortunately, yes....

Reports of beatings abound.  Also arrests were made before any protests; the
police had gathered enough intelligence on the upcoming activities to arrest
key organizers before any "free assembly" occurred.

Subject: re: my statement on philly protests - pass along

Free Speech in Franklin's City?
Rebecca Hill

      When I made my fourth visit this year to Philadelphia it was three
days
before the opening of protests against the Republican National Convention.
The excitement and warmth of a diverse crowd of people hanging around in the
neighborhoods was my first experience of Philly as an epicenter of brotherly
and sisterly love.  There were kids who'd gotten radicalized by the huge
demonstrations in Seattle and DC, people like me who'd been active for some
ten years or so, as well as older folks who'd been protesting U.S.
imperialism with Christian non-violence since the 1950s. There were street
punks, students, ravers, and, Moms. They were people of Latino, Asian, and
African-American descent, and whites, working together  - in every place I
went from the streets to the jail.
      "When I'm scared by the cops," said one man at a non-violence training
I went to before the protests started, "I invoke an image of
Gandhi -- sometimes Jesus." I'm different from this man in many ways; I'm
likely to think of an image of George Jackson at a protest, and I sang
"we're not gonna take it!" more often than any other song. Nonetheless, he
and I, and all the others had much to learn from each other as we discussed
our philosophies of democracy and equity and how to achieve them whether
among ourselves or in society at large.   Even at large meetings, I was
impressed with the successful democratic process, and with the energy and
commitment of everyone I met.
      The first protest I went to was on Monday with the Kensington Welfare
Rights Union. At City Hall, the Million Billionaires entertained us with
their chants "Gore or Bush, Bush or Gore, we don't care who you vote for -
we already bought 'em!" and those zany, rag tag pro-lifers amused us even
more with their sign "Drunkards and Fornicaters will Rot in Hell with
Tupac." Guess who has more influence on our political system?
      We marched from City Hall toward what we've christened the "FU
center,"
where the Republicans would soon be holding a pageant costing tax payers
several million dollars. Along the way, people lining the streets, or just
walking by greeted us with thumbs up, cheers, claps, and sometimes just a
looks of curiosity. A few malcontents shouted "get a job!" It wasn't too
hard to think of a response.  I could tell my experience was similar to
others when many picked up the chant: "got three jobs, Can't pay rent? Who's
gonna be your president?" with knowing jollity.
   REPUBLICANS DEFACE NEIGHBORHOODS!
      Only one thing I saw that day really upset me. Whoever was in charge
of
the convention was clearly catering to Republicans and ignoring the actual
people who lived in the neighborhoods near the convention center. They had
already defaced the streets of Philly long before the delegates' arrival.
They didn't use spray paint to make their point. Instead, Convention
decorators had hung flags of each state - including all the flags featuring
the Confederate Stars and Bars - from lampposts all along the street in what
was clearly a predominantly Black neighborhood. On Monday night, I actually
met some of those people who had come to attend the Republican convention.
While I was sitting in a bar in the train station, I met two young men in
rumpled suits who were clearly already drunk when they reeled laughing into
the bar. They told me that they'd just had a blast, gotten into the
Republican convention in order to enjoy the free caviar and champagne and
didn't care at all about the issues, and didn't even know what most of the
issues were. Where were the media to interview these guys and show them on
camera?
        On Tuesday, I participated in an action on Broad and Spruce, where
we
drummed and danced, played soccer, played with stuffed animals and sang
songs. Many in our group were there to protest the effect of current
economic "reforms" on children and teenagers, who have no say in the
political process but are affected severely by welfare reform, parental
notification laws for abortions, and increasing use of criminal sanctions
against juveniles. After we blockaded the intersection, I went to support
the group of protesters who looked the most vulnerable, the police
immediately communicated that they were ready for our non-violent protest.
As I stood between the wall of bicycle cops and seated protesters, one
officer pushed his bike into me and said "don't touch the bike! Don't touch
the bike! If you touch my bike you're gonna bite it!" I asked him if he
meant he'd shoot me and he said, "figure it out."
       The police couldn't have been happier when the moment for the arrests
finally came. They grabbed us and cinched our plastic hand-cuffs on tightly
enough to cut off circulation and cause pain.
THIS IS ILLEGAL FOR DOGS
    After they arrested us, they put us on buses. On the bus, it was
stifling
hot, as the windows barely opened. We sat, worrying over our hand-cuffs -
whose hands were blue?  "was I bleeding at my wrist?" We then stayed on the
bus from around 5:20 or so until sometime around 9:00 or 9:30pm. At some
point, a woman realized that hot air coming into the bus through what looked
like heaters.  We begged for water, but when we called out and asked for it,
the guard in the front of the bus refused us, and simply tossed a splash of
her own water against the window in front of us so that we could watch it
trickle down. One of the women noted that keeping a dog in such conditions
was illegal and we began chanting "bow wow wow yippie yo yippie-yay." When a
public defender arrived on the bus, she breathed in the heat and said
something like "Oh my God."
      We weren't let off the bus until one protester in another bus actually
passed out from dehydration.
    At this point, they brought us into the "roundhouse" to be processed.
However, instead of following the normal booking procedure, after taking our
pictures they sent us to 5' by 7' holding cells where we sat six to a cell.
They told us they would fingerprint and arraign us  - but it would take a
while, and they left us there. At around 1am or so, gave us each a
"sandwich" made of wonder bread with a piece of American cheese, clearly in
honor of the convention itself.  When a small number of us were finally
permitted our first phone calls, at one am on Thursday morning, I managed to
get word out to my parents so that they would know where I was.  Since it
was one in the morning when we got our calls, many of the detainees didn't
feel able to call their families.
         The majority of the women were practicing "jail solidarity" while
others had decided, for personal reasons, that they would need to sign bonds
and give their names to the police. However, it did not matter whether
people were willing to cooperate. One woman had identified herself early on,
because she had a five year old child, but the police left her (and all of
us), taking out a few people at a time to arraign them, and leaving the rest
of us wondering when if ever we would be allowed to leave - whether to go on
to the actual jail or to get out.  There were moments of panic and hysteria.
At some point, (I'm not sure on what day or hour because I was unable to
sleep for more than an hour at a time during the three days that I spent in
the tiny cell,) the police announced that they would be placing more people
in our already packed holding cells. Shortly afterwards, one woman a few
cells down from me started screaming and wailing "I HAVE TO GET OUT OF
HERE!!! I HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!!!" and punched her hand into the wall.
Several hours later, she was taken somewhere else and we all wondered
"where?" Was she going to get medical attention? Was she going to be sent to
a hospital for x-rays? Nobody could tell. At another moment, we heard the
men on the other side of the wall indicating that someone was being beaten.
We heard a guard say "stand up and walk like a man, bitch" and then heard
what was clearly a beating. To be witnesses we sat silently, holding hands,
and listened, many of us crying quietly.
         Despite all these pressures, because the people who are protesting
here are concerned with building community and see their lives as being
connected with others, we survived the craziness. We sang songs, held
meetings, told jokes, shared our food, and worked to get each person what
she needed.
         By the time I was arraigned, I was completely disoriented and
exhausted, and was eventually let out the door of the jail, with no phone
call onto the street at around 1:30 in the morning, still wondering "what
happened to that one who gave her name the first day and wasn't
fingerprinted until two days later? What will happen to all those women who
are going to the PIC? What will happen to the men? Now that I'm out, I'm
most worried about what will happen to those people with bails set at one
million dollars, and what this means for protest in our country.
         Protesters were the only people who took care of us. When I finally
got out, greeted by the mother of one of the other detainees, and by another
person who was - because he just felt he had to and wanted to - driving
protesters to wherever they needed to go. Protesters fed us and gave us a
place to relax and regroup and make phone calls that had been denied us in
jail. It is this spirit that I have met the entire time that I have been
here among "rag tag youth" who are protesting because they don't like the
fact that corporations are in control of our political system and our lives.
That this group of kindly people, hungry people who were sharing their only
food with each other, are now  lambasted as a bunch of "criminal
conspirators" and "cowards" is simply ridiculous.
       The truth is that the police are so afraid of non-violent protesters
that they locked up several hundred people for three and more days without
charging them, and assigned million dollar bails to activists who tried to
bring attention to issues that weren't addressed in the Republican gala this
week. The corporate owned media is so afraid of us that they won't print
much of the truth about what's going on here. When I tried to identify
myself to a cameraman as a faculty member at  a major university, he turned
his camera off and walked away. I guess that doesn't fit the story they're
trying to tell.
I'm worried about how this affects average Americans. I met a man on the
street who said to me, "guess that should teach you not to protest." I think
Ben Franklin would turn in his grave, to hear Philadelphia defended with
sentiments like these and other statements I've read in the papers in the
last few days. Those are the only demonstrations of cowardice that I have
seen in Philadelphia this summer.

Dear etc...
Hello, again. Glad to be back on....
have suddenly become aware that hardly anyone I've talked to about poetry,
especially
under 42, talks much about Creeley's GOLDIGGERS and wondering if that's
because
I didn't bring it up or for some other reason...

Anyway, I'd curious to see what people think of it. Sure, if one wants to
point me to any
formal essays or dissertation chapters, but I guess I'm curious in this more
informal
context...
       What, for instance, is this book's relation to Creeley's poetry?
        Would it be a footnote, or a key to it? Or something else?
        What is its relevance today? for you particularly?


      I think enough for now...

       I look forward to any comments....

The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.

Interesting idea.  I for one am looking forward to the posts.  But I do have
a problem with the above synopsis.  A decentering is not a suspension of
history.  Quite the contrary, it is the lack of a grounding center which
allows, even requires, history to appear.  In truth, the only way to suspend
identity and relations is to blow our brains out.  That will probably work.
If we're going to play with French theory, we gotta get it right.  Best, Bill

They are completely different books--completely different contents,

Have you looked at Nathaniel Mackey's "Robert Creeley's The Gold
Diggers: Projective Prose"?  It's a chapter in Discrepant Engagement
(recently reprinted, paperback, by University of Alabama Press --  a
discount offer to the Poetics List to follow in the next few days...)

Dear all --

I have a new responsibility as of now:  I am the calendar/"up-date" editor
for the online journal How2 (the new, online version of Kathleen Fraser's
breakthrough publication How(ever)).  So I'm asking everyone to please
keep my address on hand so you can backchannel me when you have put
together your fall reading series or know of an event, call for papers,
conference, etc., that would be of interest to How2's readers.  I'm
looking specifically for events relevant to innovative women writers.
Events can take place anywhere across North America.  I'd like at least
one month advance notice, but I'll list things up to a year away.

I know there are lots of reading series coordinators on this list, and I
would love to get the most updated schedule of events from people at the
Highwire series, Belladonna series, Lungfull/Zinc Bar series, Small Press
Traffic Series, and any and all series that I am missing or don't yet know
about.

To send me a listig or update, please put "How2 listing" in your subject
line so I will make sure to pay special attention to your email.  Please
email me directly at acgreenb@syr.edu, not to How2.

Please help me make the calendar as comprehensive and useful as possible,
while garnering free publicity for your event!

Thanks so much,

Arielle
acgreenb@syr.edu

Hey, guys --


In regards to my recent post about How2:

Sorry for any misunderstandings -- I'm very new at this -- but How2's
calendar section is primarily for calls for papers, conference listings,
and lectures by or about innovative women poets.  That's just the nature
of the site right now. I may eventually look into a way to list individual
readings, but for now, since we can't be a comprehensive resource in that
way, and we don't want people to feel left out, we're focusing on papers
and lectures and conferences, and NOT individual readings.  However, I
will make exceptions for reading SERIES curated by/focusing on innovative
women poets.  The Belladonna series by Rachel L (whom I don't yet know but
hope to soon -- hi, Rachel!) is a perfect example of the kind of series we
*can* list, and while we may not be able to list the entire schedule of
such series, I can list contact info and highlights.  I can also list
festivals/gatherings/etc. where a bunch of women poets are going to be
reading together at one time, even if it's not "a women's festival" (for
example, the recent BoPo).  I'm not sure if there are other series like
Belladonna, but if you know of one, please let me know.  And please notify
me about relevant lectures, symposia, conferences, etc.

Hope that clears things up.

Thanks so much,

Arielle

trembling foreign ec

ec is messy, said d'eruza; what's goods and services in one country isn't
necessarily equivalent in another. it's a question of human trial and
error; it's a question of ornament, kinesics, what's actually proffered
and its relationship to class and gender. all of which is problematic,
replied d'nala, which is what makes ec fascinating and fetishized; it's a
form of gambling with constantly changing currencies and crises; earth-
quakes in one part of the world affecting my earnings in another. so one
might characterize it as a trembling of abstract quantity, susceptible to
natural and artificial catastrophes and breakthroughs. exactly, said
d'eruza; and all of this combines with expectations and displays of greed
and good will, a tendency towards barter in the finer details, as well as
price leveling. then there's also migrations to urban centers, telecom
encroachments, disasters of free trade and environmental damage, enormous
wage differentials among countries. d'nala said, all of this we call ec-
onomic jostling and self-organization; no matter how disastrous or rag-
tag, someone trades somewhere, someone offers, someone receives. don't
forget the major exception, said d'eruza, the case of war, pillage, van-
dalization, destruction, plague - in other words, accounts received and
destroyed, non-payable. the internet trembles here as well, said d'nala.
everything is a trembling, replied d'eruza, it's the world-nature. exces-
sive volatility is the only certainty, coupled with monstrous leveling
where civilization huddles. against what, said d'nala. against interest
compounded, she replied.

Subject:      Representations of the Visual Artist in Literature
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

For a freshman course I will be teaching at the Rhode Island School of
Design, I'm wondering if anyone could suggest examples of the visual artist's
representation in literature.  I do not need to teach a representitive or
cannonical sample and my own initial thoughts have been somewhat quirky (I
don't want to go back further in time than the 1850s say):  Wilde's _The
Picture of Dorian Gray_, Pater's _The Renaissance_, something of Henry
James', Ashbery & O'Hara, Warhol's _A, a Novel_, Chris Kraus' _I Love Dick_,
one of the bios of Basquiat & Schnabel's film--you get the idea, I hope (one
thing I don't want to do is Browning--for the selfish reason that I'm tired
of doing *those* poems).  Would greatly appreciate any suggestions!!!

Thanks in advance.

Just like to say that I saw Susan Gevirtz and Taylor Brady read at the Bay
Area Award show last night at New Langton Arts, and it was excellent. A nice
blend of Susan's sparser, sharp otherworldly language pyrotechnics and
Taylor's sprawling twists and turns through passages that mine the
subconscious associations of the seemingly mundane and flow from the "vowel
leading sounds of words."

Nice work all around. Susan's reading breathed life into a new book I'd only
read in manuscript form (Hourglass Transcripts), while Taylor's small
chapbook whet my appetite for more to come.

Congratulations to both on the reading, and award.

Valencia (Seal Press). She is the co-founder, along with poet Sini Anderson,
of the notorious all-girl open mic and road riot Sister Spit. This fall she
will be embarking on a new cabaret tour called The Wasted Motel Tour, which
will bring an unruly gang of baby poets, tired old whores and delinquent
divas across the godforsaken USA.

Sten Rudstrøm  is a performer/writer who creates solo and collaborative
dance/theater/music works. He gained his early performance art experience in
Berlin, producing several solo works and forming the site-specific
movement/music/art band Another Slice of Reagan's Dick. Since arriving in
the Bay Area in 1990, Rudstrøm has studied with Ruth Zaporah, Sara
Shelton-Mann, Tracey Rhoades, Debbie Taylor, and Julie Kane, and has
performed in San Francisco at Theater Artaud, Footwork/Dancer's Group, New
Performance Gallery, and The Marsh. In 1996, he produced, directed and
performed in Theater of Cruelty, a critically acclaimed show based on the
life and writings of Antonin Artaud. He continues to perform nationally and
internationally at venues including Dixon Place, Highways, LACE, Splinter
Group, St. Mark's Church, Boulder Art Center, and  TanzFabrik (Berlin) and
Triade (Hamburg).

Kathy Kennedy is a sound artist working primarily with issues of the
voice and the interface of technology. She founded the innovative female
singing group ESTHER in SF, Choeur Maha in Montreal, and the women's center
for digital media studioxx.org. She also creates large scale sonic
installations for hundreds of performers called sonic choreographies.

Gino Robair: Potluck Percussion 2
  "You bring it, I'll play it!"

Gino Robair comes from a long line of musicians hailing from Northern
Italy, Hungary, and Bukovina. Primarily trained as a classical
percussionist,
Gino has played theremin, percussion, keyboards, and bowed Styrofoam on
numerous records and commercials. He has recorded with John Butcher, Anthony
Braxton, Eugene Chadbourne, Lou Harrison, Peter Kowald, Terry Riley, LaDonna
Smith, and Otomo Yoshihide, among others. He works regularly with the
Splatter Trio, the Club Foot Orchestra, and has performed with Wadada Leo
Smith, John Zorn, the ROVA saxophone quartet, and Paul Plimley.

Liz Miller is interested in the excess of stimulation and sensationalism --
how it affects the psyche and society. Her performance-based work deals with
the dynamics of temptation and repulsion and creating situations which are
simultaneously captivating an disturbing.

Kevin Killian, poet, playwright, novelist, art writer, biographer and
critic, author of Little Men, Argento Series, Bedrooms Have Windows, Shy,
and Arctic Summer.  His new book I Cry Like a Baby will be published by Hard
Press in September.

Eli Crews finds himself currently fascinated with the phenomenon of
instantaneous interpretation and misinterpretation. Different methods
of input to the performers are utilized: pre-recorded messages; written
notes or instructions; each other's sound. Players or speakers hear things
and respond, certain items get lost in the mail, other items are addressed
to the people that lived there before you, but you open them anyway. Not
unlike the children's game Telephone, but with less giggling. Maybe.
When he is not writing descriptions of himself, Mr. Crews can be seen
and heard playing bass in bands such as Shinola, Spezza Rotto, and the
Roofies.

The Moving Target Series takes its name from poet Lew Welch’s 1967 essay “A
Moving Target Is Hard to Hit,” and in the spirit of that essay the series
moves from venue to venue in San Francisco, spotlighting different arts
spaces and presenting an eclectic mix of performance, poetry, movement,
music, and film. Past shows have been at 848 Community Space, Z Space
Collective, 111 Minna Street, The Luggage Store, and New Langton Arts.
Performers have included poets Diane di Prima, Leslie Scalapino, and Bill
Berkson; choreographers Remy Charlip, Sue Roginski, and Alex Ketley;
performance artists Nao Bustamante, Ruth Zaporah, and Woody Woodman;
musicians Jon Raskin, Carla Kihlstedt, and Duck Baker; and filmmaker Konrad
Steiner.

Dear Arielle,

Just letting you know I got your message but was hoping you might list
events that might be significant outside North America.  We've just had a
great conference here (Australia) which had some brilliant papers on women
poets and interviews with and readings by writers like Tracy Ryan.  I don't
know how much help I would be with North American events but there is a
small group of HOW2 Australian readers who might find a more extended
calendar useful.

Anyway, cheers,

absolute freedom to write
within this tiny domain of space and time, i have this chance:
 to place my words almost anywhere, in almost any order, saying:
 what i want, harbored against violence, this temporary utterance
enunciation which you comprehend
i do have the width and breadth of this desk, overlooking a street
 there are almost no trees on the street, the leaves are browned
the desk is here, just now, brilliant and waiting
i have this choice to language in every direction
 names among others
 languages among others
 violations of syntax, torn semantics, disturbed texts
disturbances in every direction
quiet here so i can write the defaulting of the world
 for the moment keeping loss to a minimum

the speaking of shells and drums, the scream of poetry
 escapes freely in the air
even within the camp, vibrations and obeisance to
 natural law

Mr. Kirshenbaum,

Having moved to Alabama just dazed ago, and only ditto
joined the Poetics list, weirdly: your request for
Birmingham info! An opportunity for me to contribute, so
soon!

I don't know about bookstores or readings yet -- that is,
whether they exist here -- but HIGHLY recommend the Civil
Rights museum downtown, across the street from the 16th
Street Baptist Church that was bombed 15 September 1963.
The museum provides an extremely thoughtful and affecting
history of the civil rights movement from Jim Crow to the
present day, focussing on Alabamian events but covering
national ones too. If you have time, you can also go across
the street to the church and Deacon Green will show you
around.

Larry Keenan's Beat Gallery is now up at Beat Generation News:
http://www.beatnews.org.

In 1965, California College of Arts and Crafts student Larry Keenan was
asked by his teacher, poet and playwright, Michael McClure if he would like
to photograph a group of his friends. Asking McClure whom his friends were,
Keenan was amazed when he listed names that included Lawrence Ferlinghetti,
Allen Ginsberg, Bruce Conner, Neal Cassady and Ken Kesey. Keenan had
studied the works of these groundbreaking poets, writers and artists, and
recognized the significance of this opportunity.

Twenty-one years old, Keenan spent over a year photographing the Beats in
their homes and with their family and friends. He began documenting the
last days of the Beat Generation with a borrowed 35mm camera using mostly
Tri-X film push processed with available light and no tripod. He cleverly
made an enlarger from an old slide projector to print his work.

Keenan has been key to photo-documenting the Beats for the last few
decades, and his images have graced several Beat books, galleries, shows,
and exhibitions.

The wording of "12hr...Project" is typically vague, hence ultimately meaningless.In general poetics discussions should include clear definitions of terminology used. In some kinds of writing we enter into a sort of "game" in which what I call "the ramble coefficient" may be high.Similarly certain kinds of poetry or literature assumes a certain "enlightened" audience. But the Project's wording is like a bad book blurb. In short, the irrational always intrudes,but reality stands by with a .38.
  As to centres,to self-quote:"...We need,or postulate we need - nay,require - a centre.Everyone and everything needs a centre.There are shopping centres,centimeters,centipedes,off-centres,community centres:one thinks of being centred.In Chess it is essntial to "dominate the centre",and so on.One hears talk of
being "centred in the centre"."He is probably at the centre - not the American center - no:the REAL centre.We could in fact well BE that centre.The centre that postulates itself."And so on.

CHICAGO REVIEW 46:3/4 -- NEW POLISH WRITING (guest-edited by W. Martin)

This 300-page issue, devoted to the last decade of Polish writing,
will be a comprehensive survey of the most recent work by several
generations of Polish poets (translated into English, of course).
Among the 50 poets included are:

-- the generation of poets born before World War II, such as Zbigniew
Herbert, Tymoteusz Karpowicz, Ursula Koziol, Czeslaw Milosz, Tadeusz
Rozewicz, and Wislawa Szymborska
-- the "New Wave" poets of the 1970s (Stanislaw Baranczak, Julian
Kornhauser, Ryszard Krynicki, and Adam Zagajewski)
-- the poets of the 1980s, such as Piotr Sommer, Ewa Lipska, and Bronislaw Maj
-- and the latest phenomenon, the so-called "[Frank] O'Haraists" (aka
the "New Barbarians") affiliated with the literary journal _bruLion_,
who burst onto the scene in the early 1990s. These poets include
Krysztof Koehler, Marcin Baran, Marcin Sendecki, and Marcin Swietlicki

In addition to poetry, the issue will have translations of new
fiction (by Stefan Chwin, Henryk Grynberg, Slawomir Mrozek, Adrzej
Stasiuk, Olga Tokarczuk, Magdalena Tulli, and others) and feuilletons
(by Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski, Pawel Huelle, Stanislaw Lem, and
others).

To help the uninitiated navigate through this dynamic territory,
we'll be publishing several critical essays that address the last
decade of Polish writing. These essays concentrate on the questions
of novelty, selfhood, the Solidarity movement, and life after
communism. Also included will be an interview with Piotr Sommer, who
can be said to have single-handedly sparked "O'Haraism" with his
influential New York School issue of the journal _Literatura Na
Swiecie_ (1986).

Any way you slice it, this issue promises to be an indispensable
introduction to contemporary Polish writing, which is considered by
many to be the most energetic and diverse literature of the New
Europe.

Hank Lazer just mentioned Nathaniel Mackey which reminded me I recently
stumbled across a most wonderful book.  Mackey said nice things on the
back cover so I bought it (Michael Heller & Donald Revell also said nice
things there, so one and a half more reasons . . .).

The book is Norman Finkelstein's _Track_.  Book-length poem and completely
beautiful from page 7-90.  It seems to fit somewhere between Oppen's "Of
Being Numerous" and Michael Palmer's "Sun." On first reading . . .
possibly.

It seems to have come out in 1999.  Was there any talk of it at the time?
If there was, I seem to have missed it.

Buy TWO copies!

"Hey," I used to tell her,
"I'm not paying you to talk."
Then I got dead in a police shooting of
natural causes.
You have a gun, Don,
use it.
Now I'm getting my Willy Wonked.
Spanking the monkey.
Getting a hummer.
I'd love to reassure you but
I need a tetnus shot.

I used to stand around and
ask folks if I could
search their cars for drugs.
Sometimes they'd ask if I was a cop but
usually I'd just pocket anything interesting.
Oh! It's Miss Information
looking like death on a trisket.
The other bad thing about marriage is that
you have to talk to each other.
We call it
kissing time goodbye.

It's not just pretty words,
it's true.
Every hour he's out of jail
he's away from home.
I took viagra and got taller.
Bag his hands and roll'im,
that's what I say.
Frivolity is the refusal to suffer.
If you could do anything,
what would you do?
1.  Smoke marijuana 600 miles from the nearest human.
2.  Be invisible.
All art consists of the slight,
progressive alterations of accepted forms
and patterns, often of biological origin.
Similar to cosmetics.
It's what you have when all your friends
are part of the water table.
Why mess with natural selection?

Greetings once again
from Valparaso, Chile.

The big news these days at Le Chantier is our latest event: the EXPATRIATE
YOURSELF POETRY CONTEST. It's our very first Poetry Contest here at the
virtual kaf. We figured it would do you a lot of good to roam around the
world a little, but often the possibility of international travel is an
impossibility for you. Well, whoever wins this contest is going to be
expatriated for a while, since first prize is a Round Trip Airfare from
the
US to South America (so I can meet the winner). Come down here, meet new
people, learn a new language, work on your writing, be a tourist, get lost
in the Andes, etc. Visit http://LeChantier.com for details.

Remember, I don't have a physical residence so to speak, but I do live in
my
virtual home at zkotpen@lechantier.com, so please write me there with your
thoughts and comments, as well as for information on our travels and
projects here at Le Chantier.

take care...

titles...

Crosscut Universe: Writing on Writing from France
Edited & Translated by Norma Cole
160 pp., offset, smyth-sewn
ISSN 0269-0179  Serie d'Ecriture
ISBN 1-886224-39-0 original paperback $15


Norma Cole has combed through books, little magazines, and
correspondence to gather an exciting body of writing by our French
contemporaries. There are letters, poems, interviews, critical pieces,
and texts that cannot be classified.

The authors include Anne-Marie Albiach, Joe Bousquet, Danielle
Collobert, Jean Daive, André Du Bouchet, Dominique Fourcade, Liliane
Giraudon, Emmanuel Hocquard, Claude Royet-Journoud, Jacques Roubaud,
Agnès Rouzier.

The texts (whether excerpted or complete) were selected for their
interest as writing and for the conversation they enter into by
appearing together. A conversation that creates new contexts for each
individual text, but also widens the perspective in which a great deal
of writing imported from France, for instance poésie blanche-- the
writing of the "blank page"-- can be read. This conversation, rigorous
and vigilant, addressing issues such as biographical and historical
circumstances, and the relation of writing to other writing (reading),
has been taking place for some time. Here are some pieces of it, most
of them appearing for the first time in English.

Introduction, Norma Cole

"Par ces rappels, je n'entends rien prouver, mais seulement orienter
l'attention." Maurice Blanchot, L'entretien infini

There are conversations embedded in these pages, a kind of cross-talk
through time and space. Texts, interviews, critical pieces, journal
entries, letters, worknotes and at least one simple list make visible
and audible an openwork of embodied voices in conversation, in the
deliberate breaking open of intentionalities, isolating single
elements at one extremity, multiple folds, complex rhythmic
architechtonics in the process of being constructed and deconstructed
at the other. Most of these pieces have been published in France in
literary journals, as books or as parts of books, although at least
one has been circulated privately as a "report." One text, a guest
becoming ghost, was revoked when the author, although pleased with the
translation, decided his own text needed to be completely rewritten.
Some of the writing here will extend the available work of writers
previously translated and now familiar to North American readers,
while a number of texts will introduce new work and new names.

Dialogic threads echo and reverberate through considerations of body
and book, silence as both restraint and production of meaning, the
neuter or neutral as the unassigned in relation to sociopolitical
complexities of address, the sentence of syntax and precedent. Sets of
references indicate points of orientation and question assumptions of
assignment. Their generosity and hospitality are striking as is their
rigor of investigation. Writing is action, the phenomenological self
entering language, already a specific set of conditions within
conditions.  Writing and its silences are made up of specific concrete
decisions. Circumstances and events (such as two world wars and the
Algerian struggle for independence), from detail to detail, date to
date, are not backdrop but termining facts appearing at different
focal lengths, from naming to silence, testing the orders of
apprehension as well as of writing.

Here is a range of writing at varying stages of coming into being,
self-aware, proposing a stance very different from the taxonomy of
"text/paratext." In _Beginnings_, Edward Said asserts, "One of the
critical distinctions of modern literature is the importance given by
the writer to his own paratexts -- writings that explore his working
problems in making a text." The opposite impulse is at work here, for
what is of interest is how the texts read together intentionally or
inadvertently, addressing each other and writing beyond the limits of
this or any single volume.

Norma Cole lives in San Francisco. her books of poems include Mars,
Moira, Contrafact, Desire and its Double, & The Vulgar Tongue. Her
translations of French poets have appeared in many publications.


========================


Ernst Jandl
reft and light
translated from the German by various American poets
poems, 112 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISSN 1077-4203 "Dichten ="
ISBN 1-886224-34-X, paper $10

Ernst Jandl's poems are so engrained in the German language that they
are impossible to translate. This volume present an unusual
experiment: for each German poem there is not one, but several
adaptations, so that the original is encircled by multiple English
analogues. The responses range from close imitations to freewheeling
versions that continue Jandl's thinking into other semantic areas.

Ernst Jandl was born in 1925 in Vienna. He began publishing poems in
1956 and quickly attracted attention as the wittiest and most
exuberant of experimental poets, with a knack for uncovering the comic
potential in discrepancies between sound and spelling, in cliches,
mispronunciations, dialect etc. Readers with a bit of German will
enjoy his 'surface translation' of "My heart leaps up when I behold"
into mai hart lieb zapfen eibe hold.... He has not only explored the
limits of language in his visual and sound  poems, but has written
powerful political commentary by playing with "Auslanderdeutsch," the
kind of pidgin German spoken by foreign workers.

He has translated Gertrude Stein, Robert Creeley's The Island, and
John Cage's Silence.

Among his many prestigious literary prizes in both Austria and Germany
are the Georg-Trakl-Preis (1974), Georg-Buchner-Preis and Grosser
Osterreichischer Staatspreis (both 1984).

He died in June, 2000 while this volume was in production.

The translators include Charles Bernstein, Lee Ann Brown, Tina
Darragh, Ray DiPalma, Rachel Blau DuPlessis,  Kenward Elmslie, Anselm
Hollo, Julie Patton, Joan Retallack, Cole Swensen, Craig Watson,
Marjorie Welish, John Yau, et als.

Alas, the Buffalo email system is not working today and so it is impossible for folks on that system to get access to their email, including messages posted to this list. The list service will be restored as soon as this problem is fixed.

According to the technical advice posted on UB's web site, they hope to
restore
the email service on Friday for a brief time before shutting it down again
through Sunday night for a scheduled mail maintenance. (Go figure.) It
seems to
me this will make it unlikely that Poetics List posts will go out again until
Monday, when those using the "buffalo.edu" email will once again have
access to
their accounts. In which case, have a good weekend!

CULTURAL EXCHANGE BRINGS TWO TIJUANA POETS TO LOS ANGELES

Bajo el Mismo Sol (Under the Same Sun), an international cultural exchange
program between the cities of Los Angeles and Tijuana, will present "Poetas
por Pintores" ("Poets for Painters") with Elizabeth Cazess=FAs and Eduardo
Arellano reading their works on Friday, August 18th, from 8 to 10 p.m. at
Espresso Mi Cultura, 5625 Hollywood Boulevard (corner of Gramercy) in
Hollywood, and on Saturday, August 19th., from 1 to 3 p.m. at the 15th
annual African Marketplace & Cultural Faire in Rancho Cienega Park, 5001
Rodeo Road in Los Angeles. Admission.s to both readings are free, but there
is a $3.00 entrance fee for African Marketplace.

Examples of their poetry, in Spanish and English, can be found below. The
poets will read in Spanish. Translations of most of the poems will also be
read.

Tijuana-born Elizabeth Cazess=FAs, who has written poetry since 1972, will
read an excerpt from her new book *La Mujer de sal* (Woman of Salt).
Considered one of the leading poets in Baja California, she has one
numerous awards in Mexico.

Eduardo Arellano, who was born in Zacatecas, Zacatecas, has published three
collections of poetry: *Di=E1sporo o pasi=F3n* (1985), *Desierto de la=
 palabra*
(1994), and *La Tierra destinada* (1999). He has lived in Mexicali and
Tijuana since 1988 and is a member of the faculty of the School of the
Humanities of the Universidad Aut=F3nomo de Baja California.

For the next year Bajo el Mismo Sol will bring two poets monthly to
different venues in Los Angeles. Simultaneously, Los Angeles painters will
have their works exhinited in six different galleries in Tijuana. For the
following year the exchange will be reversed.

For further information call Luis Ituarte, (213)485-4474.

WOMAN OF SALT (excerpt)

I
Mother I voyage to the depths of the sea
to leave in your hands the cast of my face
coastlines where my rivers meld with yours
the lenses of my eyes
seeing me in your tides at last                                                         =09
Lend me your quetzal feather
for my skirt the waves of the sea
anklets of snailshells and bells
adorning my feet in exchange for this offering
May my steps on staircase and balcony
intone a song that the birds carry
to the great lords of light reaching
the ears of Neptune
before he awaken.

II
I strip off the clothes of abandonment
that the flames of Sodom illuminate
The salt of my tears will clothe me
a river of glow-worms and garlands.
For your sake the light from the mountains falls
before your turquoise dress
when in the morning the customary sun rises.



Eduardo Arellano

from THE LOVER'S DAWN

So as to clothe ourselves in leaves, so as to steal the fruit and prepare
ourselves
a banquet of delicious prohibitions, with toothy sweetness,
love, let us taste each other while we live.

This garden flowers despite weather,
carving out of our bodies
a view into each other's depths, each time further=20
into blood and lip where that which rebels,=20
that which breathes in us,
still hides, the blind well of this moment=20
when you know yourself mine,
and something tells us that we have exceeded
the second's compass.

Wait, don't return yet to your name, observe these vestiges,
the field that opens before exhausted bodies.
Astonished as you are, taste this seed
about to sprout for us, beyond us
in a paradise where nothing is marginal
and a wind without origin delivers us its breath.

"I consider this hour by hour: If I should die now, have I written suffic-
ient? I don't think my work easily sums up; there are far too many edges,
confusions. Philosophy is my first love; I would want this to stand or
fail by such. But it must be dragged out between the scraps and clutter.
I mean this in all sincerity: What remains? For how long? For what read-
ers? The first question is the most important: The What of my work, the
content, reading between or through the lines, searching out the philoso-
phical among the ruins." (Alan, quoted by Jennifer.)

Jacques--One of the best is I've read is Joyce Cary's novel The Horse's
Mouth. Cary was a painter before he began writing fiction, and you sense it
right away. It also gives you the chance to bring in Blake, since his
art/poetry figure in it from page one. You can't do the course w/o Blake!
Also gives you the chance to show the Alec Guinness film, AG as Gulley
Jimson. Sounds like a great course! best, Sylvester

The trAce/Alt-X Competition for New Media Writing

Prize: One Thousand English Pounds

IS THIS STILL HYPERTEXT?

Publishing on the Web has exploded in recent months, with everyone from Stephen King to six-year-olds putting their books on the Web for readers to download.

But the Web is more than just a way to deliver electronic books. Multimedia elements such as animation and sound, programming languages such as Java and Javascript, and new ways to link these with text make reading on the Web different from and more exciting than reading print.

To reward the best writers in this new medium, trAce and Alt-X are holding

The trAce/Alt-X Competition for New Media Writing

Prize: One Thousand English Pounds

This is the second time the competition has been held (see below for winners last time). The first time around we called it the International Hypertext Competition, but the notion of hypertext doesn't go far enough to describe the innovative, lively and ground-breaking literature which is appearing today.

Part of the challenge is for the artists/writers themselves to help us decide exactly what New Media Writing is. Everyone working in the area of net-art and net-writing is constantly asking the question 'What is this new genre? Is it new? Is it a genre? What is it that we're making here? How do we name it? What are its characteristics?'

In the introduction to the Ink.Ubation Salon he curated for the recent trAce Incubation conference, Mark Amerika wrote:

"Over the past three years, the trAce online writing community has become one of the premiere international locations on the WWW known for its generous support of net-based writing, particularly when it comes to bringing greater visibility to pioneering writer-artists who are busying themselves by reinventing writerly practice -- particularly our accepted notions of "authorship," "text" and "publishing."

This contest acknowledges that the web itself is a work-in-process and so, as a result, we're looking for work that continues to stretch our preconceived notions of what writing is. As part of their entry, writers are asked to provide a description of their site and what it seeks to achieve creatively and technically, as well as answering the question 'What name do you give to the kind of art exhibited in that site?' We're hoping that their responses will help us identify just what it is that writers and artists think they are doing out there on the web.

The deadline for submissions is 30th September 2000 and the results will be announced in December 2000

This year's judge is Shelley Jackson, writer and multimedia artist, and author of the acclaimed hypertext novel Patchwork Girl (Eastgate 1995), a feminist reworking of the Frankenstein myth. Her other e-publications include the award-winning My Body (Alt-X 1997), a semi-fictional autobiography in hypertext, and her own ever-expanding web site, Shelley Jackson's Ineradicable Stain http://www.ineradicablestain.com.

THE FIRST COMPETITION

The results of the first trAce/Alt-X International Hypertext Competition were announced in 1999, when the prize was shared between:

Mark Amerika, Director of the Alt-X Online Network http://www.altx.com said of the competition "The sheer volume of interest in our trAce/Alt-X contest, as well as the quality of the work being submitted, has convinced me that a new form of narrative art is emerging in cyberspace, one that equally borrows from the literary, performing, conceptual and visual arts, but that is also experimenting with the Net as a unique medium with its own compositional potential."

Sue Thomas, Director of trAce http://trace.ntu.ac.uk , added "trAce is delighted to be working with Alt-X in establishing what will surely form the touchstone for web-based writing. The winning sites prove the existence of a new breed of artist, one who combines science and art to the highest advantage. It's thrilling to see just what can happen when writers become programmers and vice-versa, and it's also no surprise that one of the joint winners was a collaborative effort. The web is an excellent tool for bringing artists together."

the inexpressible, the [lover's discourse] is based upon what cannot be put into

Robin Magowan, Memoirs of a Minotaur:  From Merrill Lynch to Petty Heart
to Poetry (Ashland, Oregon:  Story Line Press,
1999).  ISBN:  1-885266-79-0.  273 pages.  $16.95 paperback.

         This memoir by Robin Magowan offers not just a chronology of
self-formation for the Merrill Lynch heir to the fundamentals of
capital-building and sexual excess. At its core is a poetic quest for
language and vision, a text written and formed in "the visionary company
of love" which would include Rimbaud, Whitman, F Scott Fitzgerald, and
Henri Michaux. The "labyrinth" the self is entangled in as tortured
"minotaur" is the excess of wealth and business nexus, the solipsism of
sexual need and self-consciousness, the social determinations of class and
culture that are never fully voided. But the mentor figures in the book
are, oddly enough, James Merrill as delicate social force and trainer of
agape, and Nancy Ling Perry as the militant  apocalypse of drugs, SLA
revolutionary ideology, rage, bliss, and death. Somewhere between these
two voices, lost in the heights of Tibet and clarity of meditative
consciousness and restraint, Robin Magowan finds a new self and heightened
language, and reveals much about the American capitalist self in the
process. This is a wondrous book capturing the 1960s at its visionary and
crazy core, and moving out of the conformist 1950s into something
better. It enacts a poetic quest worthy of a great soul, written with
courage, lucidity, and need:  a "drunken boat" casting its waves from
Merrill Lynch to Dante and ordinary selfhood.  This memoir utters a prayer
of "crack up" like Fitzgerald's uttered in the micro-cracks, wounding, and
megatrends of capital gone inward into self-abolishment and the quest for
vision.

Yes, *Track* is an exceptional book--I've got a briefish review of it in
Jacket #11, which pretty much says, hey, read this.  The poem is an ongoing
project of Finkelstein's, and Bill Burmeister and I will be publishing another
installment later this year as a Diaeresis Chapbook.  So watch this space!

Would appreciate references on the use of absence, erasures, gaps,
fragmentation, etc. in contemporary poetry.

Thanks.

Dear Colleagues

Many of you will know that Reality Street Editions is publishing  A BOOK FOR
TOM RAWORTH to celebrate the work of this important poet.

Many fine contributions have already been received and accepted; but the
book is not yet complete. For a variety of reasons which may make a good
story one day, it hasn't yet been possible to contact everyone I would wish
to; and time is passing.

Hence this message. Submissions are still being accepted, but the time is
almost up.

We're interested in contributions from those who, in one way or another,
have been *associated with Tom over the years.

If you are interested in this project and would like details, please contact
me by email as soon as possible. NB I may need a few days to respond; please
be patient.

You can also help by copying this message to others who might be interested

Lawrence Upton

Hi Richard!  "Typically" vague?  Typical for whom?  Why be vague and
meaningless (nothing is meaningless) when we can be sharp and specific?  All
the centers you mention are of course provisional--especially the shopping
center, I pray to god!!!  Anyway, no big thing.  I'm still looking forward to
your posts.  I admired the example you provided.  Maybe you could say that
the fractured images "draw attention" to the issues of identity, relations,
center--something like that.   Forgive me for sticking my two cents in  where
it probably doesn't belong.  You seem like a formidable guy and I'm delighted
to be in contact.  Best wishes, Bill

1.  Charles Bernstein
2.  Perloff
3.  anything by Derrida (it's all in there, though the focus is rarely poetry)
4.  Heidegger (travels well over time)
5.  anything by Hugh Kenner on Modernism (he's especially good on Eliot and
his remarks                     certainly apply to current poetry)
6.  Modern Poetry and the Idea of Language by Gerald L. Bruns (good overview,
not     restricted to contemporary exemplars, which is good)

Lots of other very good books out there, but I haven't seen one that gets any
further than these guys.  If you're looking for works that address how
specific contemporary poets fiddle with the ideas/devices you mention, I've
been avoiding them (with a few exceptions).  Most of those books are more
dissertation fodder than tools for a well rounded understanding.  Most, but
no doubt not all.  Best, Bill

Wasn't Lust For Life (V. van Gogh) a book before a movie?

Last week, in my rush to get the list caught up
before the weekend's planned outage of campus
email services, I accidentally directed a "review"
of subscribers' email addresses to the list rather
than, as was intended, the administrative account.
I apologize for any discomfort or inconvenience the
message may have caused. As many of you know, I've
maintained a "no review" policy since I became
moderator in January of 1999 - in contrast to the
time preceding, when any subscriber could order
from the listserv program a message such as went
out on Friday. I don't have any plans to change
that policy, and I'm sorry for having acted at
variance with it myself.
     Nevertheless, the results of the message
are likely to be less than disastrous: it was
rather in concern over potential problems, than
in reaction to any actual problems that I chose
to do away with the "review" option. In general,
subscribers to the Poetics List have been very
responsible with the information thus available,
and I don't anticipate that general courtesy
will change. If anything, we may see only a
reduction in the number of address queries.

Charles and I are doing what we can to have the
message removed from the list archive - the
possibility of which is yet to be determined.
I suspect that it could be done, supposing we
are able to reach the right person, and supposing
that person is willing to accomodate the request.
Given the degree of supposition involved, I prefer
for the time being to reside in the subjunctive,
and will not say that the message -can- be removed,
nor that it -will- be. Whatever alarm this matter
may raise may be diminished in recalling that
the email address of anyone who has posted to
the Poetics List has been publicly available from
that moment; for many of you, the persistence of
the message in question would be little change.
In any case, I will give notice the list of any
development in our effort.

Thanks for your patience.

the work at hand. Deadline: September 15th.

I'm also interested in getting maybe a couple more interviews and essays. PLEASE
DO NOT EMAIL ME AT MY COLUMBIA ACCOUNT. Please address all queries (or send
finished work) to me at my new email:

readmemag@excite.com

Here's a sketchy overview of what's planned for issue 4:

I n t e r v i e w s

Martin Corless-Smith / Benjamin Friedlander / Drew Gardner / Kevin Killian /
Julie Patton / Wanda Phipps / Ron Silliman (Part 2) / Fatimah Tuggar / Mark

0 Smoke rests in quiet air; you glisten, water's truth.
1 No vanes but smoke drift; small waves, no foam, dissolving you.
2 Winds rustle, vanes move; small waves, moody, short.
3 Leaves and twigs; lost memories, and crests begin their shudder.
4 Dust raised, see leaves twirl; whitecaps, whitecaps!
5 Small trees swaying; you surface; look for the foam at sea.
6 Large branches and crests foaming, everything mixed up.
7 Whole trees, heaved seas, sloshed origins of worlds.
8 Streaked foam, broke twigs, abandoned things and beings.
9 Dark currents, loose tiles, ropes taut and broken, falling seas.
10 Uprooted trees and waves hang over fate of worlds confused.
11 Torrents everywhere in dissolution of beings and inverted seas.
12 The world of hidden things and devastations.
13 World of shrieks and fallen names and cries.
14 No cries no things no worlds;
15 No cries no things no worlds

        Yes, LUST FOR LIFE was first a book, by Irving Stone, who also
edited LETTERS TO THEO, Vincent's letters to his brother.

        As with so many things to do with van Gogh, from auctions of his
works to the reproducton business--these works, the two books and the
Vincent Minelli directed film with Kirk Douglas Vincent and Anthony
Quinn, were great hits at bookstores and box offices around the world.

        And just think--they eventually led to "Starry Night"--remember
the hit song?

        Thank goodness for the former preacher van Gogh that he believed
that our reward in is in heaven, not on earth--

        as others here below in the Vale of Tears are reaping such
benefits from his works, which brought him close to nothing material--

        (Of course some cynic might remark, well if he was spiritual about
art, why should he have cared about its material success in the first
place--better to leave that to those who are!.
        A van Gogh was found here not so long ago in a Milwaukee suburb--it
had been in the family for a while and just hanging up in the
house--as a bit of homely decoration--until
"discovered"--and voila! like hitting the lottery!--riches appeared!)

I hope the list of everyone's email address was for the people who were
looking for specific email addresses.
If anyone happened to copy that list for their own personal mass emailings
of events and such, please remove me. I'd rather get my info through the

Subject:      His Life: A Poem
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

In Munro's, a bookstore that seems far too large for the little city it's in
(Victoria, BC), and which for some reason doesn't put poetry way in the back
corner, I came across and acquired His Life: A Poem, by George Bowering.
It's a real find! Poems written based on diary notes from the soltices and
equinoxes (thus four per year) from '58 to '88. In addition to the absolute
loveliness of the writing itself, you can get a real feel for a world that
is just ever so slightly distanced from your own (in my case, Bowering is 11
years my senior so was a real grownup poet when I was still noodling in
highschool with the Oscar Williams anthology as sole companion). It is in
this sense a completely realized world. It feels like a great gift to read.

I don't know if SPD has it -- and I got the only one Munro's had -- but
there is a web site: www.ecw.ca/press

To Bill etal. I wasn't being too serious about the 12hr project, and the
thing about centrs came from along poem that I wrote (vaguely a la
Ashbery's Flow Chart) in response to a "challenge" by a fellow N.Z. poet
whose name I supress for now in case there's an earthquake on the net! But
I think that literary theory tends to get too waffly. I like M.Perloff and
C. Bernstein etc but why not be concise and clear when required? In a poem
or in certain lit. we are "talking" at different levels. If the Russians
and British technitians (and I was a Telcom/Electronics Eng.Tech. until
1987)spoke like literary theorists there'd be more balls ups. Anyway I'm
not formidable,I'm just a plodder. The editor of SALT (a small N.Z. mag NOT
the Australian SALT) chopped up my long poem (hand written) and publised it
with BEGIN AGAIN: being repeated. The idea being that the idea of a work
beginning at an arbitrary place (cf Valery on a poem only being interrupted
not finished)(and cf J P Sartre's "Nausea")was illogical. After all life
doesnt. Of course we divide things up, but I just needed,or felt I needed a
project. In other words if somebody would commission a (poetic) symphony
so to speak for the right money I'd do one (am doing through my "Infinite
Poem" (more on that project later))! I dont want to sound arrogant or
formidable though. Anyway here's another short piece from thr
BEGINNING,MIDDLE,AND... BEGIN AGAIN:
The grandmaster revolves,seeing the oil of rainbows,whose colours,once
described,were always there - or something or rather of this sort,and
notwithstanding it, whatever IT is,HAS begun,whose lyric intensity
overwhelms us like an acid wave. BEGIN AGAIN
The Editor put the "BEGIN AGAIN'S" in! So, no, I wasnt thinking directly
about centres, I dont really think much about what I write. Its more like I
imagine composing music could be - or improvising which I used to do on the
piano.The email for SALT is http://homepages.ihug.co.nz\~mbellard\ Thanks
for you kind comments, Best wishes, Richard Taylor.  >

>Hullo Bill Again.Could you send who you are etc? As to the questions of
"centres" I suppose it was in my subconscious.After all,we (or I) tend to
just accept things.Imagine if we WERE in a kind of space-time world, or
where things changed (Monty-Python style) constantly?In Auckland (or
Panmure where I am) there are a lot of volcanic cones, infact I'm looking
at Mt Maungakiekie(Mt Wellington) now. It was there when Iwas a boy
(1950s). Imagine myshoch if itwasnt there next time I looked up!Regards

Hands Collected   The Books Of Simon Perchik
Poems: 1949-1999
Edited by David Baratier
ISBN #1-886350-85-X
Perfect bound, olive green cover, with quotes from famous people
612 pages

Includes 59 new poems and complete editions of every book. 612 pages,
olive cover. Simon Perchik was born December 24, 1923 in Paterson, New
Jersey and his appearance in extremely influential, and now legendary
little magazines such as Truck, Manroot, Tish, Measure, Oink, and
Sparrow has shown his depth of commitment to small presses.
Concurrently, large print run publishers from The Nation to The New
Yorker; from Poetry to Partisan Review; from Southern Poetry Review to
the Ohio Review began publishing his work in their pages. Until the
publication of this book, the work of one of our most talented poets has

been largely unavailable. This is his seventeenth collection of poetry
which clearly shows how the usage of punctive and typographical metonymy

could be a concern for future writers, and expands the general
understanding of the Black Mountain Movement, not as one simply focused
on history or motion of the line across the page as breath with only one

acceptable locution, but rather as one that made the sincerest
“sirventes against the city of Toulouse;” a generation of practitioners
splintered in newness.

For an interview with Simon Perchik and poems contained in the
collection please see:
http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket08/perchik-iv.html

Let others jockey for position. Perchik’s poems are obdurant and honest
and will reach those who need them most.
          — James Tate

At Corinth, two temples stood next to one another: one to violence and
one to necessity. Mr. Perchik’s poems attend both temples, and are often

terrifying compressions of the violence in simple daily acts. He makes
dense and sometimes brutal poems with all the implicit tenderness of a
full man.
             — Paul Blackburn

I was delighted to hear from Mr. Perchik, as I always am, and read his
poems with my usual pleasure in his feeling and language, and with great

avidity therefore, and only had that falling-feeling at that point which

he must know himself, that the human does have that thing in it which,
let in, at least to expression, levies something (example, say, family
reference of the person etc. — the social — as against that inner good,
virtue, no matter what the filthy eighteenth century did to that too
((as well as it did to the contract social)). So much of what Perchik
does include (but leaves it at the heart level) is this important thing,

and I always hear it, as he knows, in what he does.
               — Charles Olson

Every country, every culture has its unsung masters, as indeed does
every art form. Perchik is American poetry’s unsung master— a true
original, a writer who follows his solitary path, ignoring the currents
of fashion. Some of us —small groups of enthusiasts scattered across the

globe— have taken this work into our hearts and try to share it with a
world that often does not have time for originality on this scale. I for

one enjoy this poetry; I do not study it, or pore over it; I read it.
And then I read it again, because with every reading it becomes obvious
what a master Simon Perchik really is.
         — Tony Frazer

Simon Perchik’s extraordinary lyric talent is one of the best kept
secrets in contemporary American poetry. Perchik’s performances are
superior to those of most contemporaries, avoiding safe closet dramas
and reflexive ironies. Again and again, elemental tokens-rain and stone,

pairs of signature hands-establish a mythic field for the complex
interplay of memory and desire so essential to the lyric’s fierce
struggle against oblivion. Clever conceits and surreal leaps orchestrate

very personal material into archetypal configurations that approach
transcendence.

           — Edward Butscher

Simon Perchik, as one in a community of poets, should be welcomed into
the fold. He can teach us how to be different from each other, as we
think we are, but need to be reminded by one like Perchik that the
difference should be original...

                — David Ignatow

What is always clear...is that this is a complex, lyrical vision of the
commonplace. Even a meager narrative is hardly worth noticing, finally,
in the midst of these exquisite imaginings. It is the constant struggle
in this process which empowers his poetry, and provides tension in his
lyric.
        — Naton Leslie


Simon Perchik’s poetry is harshly urban, its tone established by violent

verbs (yank, twirl, rake, cock, attack) and equivalent nouns (buzz,
risk, jet, rock, clank) by means of which it purges itself of song and
sentimentality. And its images are tough: “At five / the office
buildings in Manhattan / grow a hollowed spine”, “one young maple /
screams insensibly with reds and yellows”; “July’s jet fight / on top
the heart”. Sometimes it becomes a private poetry, a quality intensified

by Mr. Perchik’s omission of all titles, so that it is hard to find the
centers of thought or feeling or observation it clusters around. Yet
allusions to birds and flight express a gently recurrent yearning, and
images of mirrors and photographs imply a search through the self, of
which, perhaps, the poems are agglomerated fragments. And the forms are
tight. Lines click into place, and, despite occasional obscurities,
these are few serious confusions. It is a poetry hard to feel but
intellectually alive ... Working close to the deeper sources of poetry,
in modes reflecting individuality and technical determination, Mr.
Perchik is the most         original....
                  — Donald W. Baker, in Poetry

Perchik’s poetry is an intensely personal, high-voltage vision,
formalized into poetry by compression, crisp language, and sharp nervous

rhythms. Like the best poets of our age, he works directly from his own
“local” — immediate daily life. No angelic ravings, no subway visions
for this man. Instead, a tough urban wit and an almost
successfully-hidden gentleness.
         — Frederick Eckman

The flash and swirl of images in the hands of a less gifted poet would
be indulgent—here they explode from a central potency: Perchik’s
emotional maelstrom sucks up all manner of objects. We soar and spin,
secure only in the felt knowledge that he will let us down revivified,
somehow more complete than we were before we entered his world.
                — Robert Peters

These are poems with fresh insights sticking out all over them and they
ought to give pleasure to anyone whose mind is still open to new
poetry.                — X.J. Kennedy

Simon Perchik was born December 24, 1923 in Paterson, New Jersey. He is
a graduate of New York University having received a B.A. in English and
LLB in Law. As a pilot during World War II, he was awarded the
Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal w/three Oak Leaf Clusters, ETO
Ribbon w/three Battle Stars, and the Presidential Unit Citation.
Following admission to the New York Bar in 1951, he was in private law
practice, save for five years as Assistant District Attorney for Suffolk

County, New York. He has seventeen collections of poetry published to
his credit and continues to be widely published in many periodicals
including The New Yorker, The Nation, International Poetry Review,
Partisan Review, Massachusetts Review and the Southern Poetry Review.
Mr. Perchik continues to reside in East Hampton, New York with his
family.

The Chinese poet & editor Bei Ling, a resident for the last few years in
Providence & Boston, was arrested in Beijing a week ago.  His brother,
living in Beijing, has also just been arrested.  Charges have not been
announced but Bei Ling is being detained by the unit responsible for
political subversion.

I met Bei Ling often while he lived in Providence - he was a friend, and a
tenant, of my ex-wife & children for a year or so.  I published his poems
in Nedge.  He's extremely friendly, intelligent, unusual.  Edits an
international journal called "Tendencies" in Cambridge.

This arrest is a crime against free thought & speech.
There is an op-ed piece by Susan Sontag in the Times today
(Saturday).  I will be trying to do what I can to press for his release,
& encourage others to do likewise.  If someone would forward this to
the Buffalo list, & other writer's lists, I would be grateful.

Henry

Mime-Version: 1.0

First we criticise our various governments for not funding poetry adequately;
then, when they do . . .

List members may be interested in historian Cassandra Pybus's article in
Jacket # 12 titled "The CIA as Culture Vultures". It looks carefully at the
figures that detail the extrordinary shower of money the Amercian Central
Intelligence Agency secretly poured into the coffers of one of Australia's
leading cultural and literary magazine for two decades. Literary editors of
Quadrant have included poet James McAuley, poet and academic Vivian Smith
and poet Les Murray, recently recipient of the Queen of England's  Poetry
Medal.

Here's the link:

        http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket12/pybus-quadrant-cia.html


Here's an excerpt from Cassandra Pybus's piece:

"Quadrant [magazine] was the brainchild of Richard Krygier, the founding
secretary of the Australian branch of the Congress for Cultural Freedom
which was established by the CIA in 1950 as a key element in their strategy
to combat Soviet propaganda. Michael Josselson, chief of the Agency's
Berlin Office for Covert Action, was the executive director of the Paris
Secretariat. He was later joined by another agent, John Hunt, and by the
late fifties there were five CIA operatives working in the Secretariat. In
its first year the CIA outlay on the Congress for Cultural Freedom was
$200,000, close to 2 million dollars in 1999 [Australian dollar] terms.
Later they set up the Fairfield Foundation as a front; one of any number of
private foundations used to launder CIA money, of which the Ford Foundation
and Rockefeller Foundation were especially prominent....

"Josselson was not happy with the make-up of the Australian committee since
the CIA strategy was to court intellectuals of the non-communist left, not
fund a bunch of zealous anti-communists. Alarmed by Josselson's
dissatisfaction, Krygier sought the advice of the editor of  "Encounter",
Irving Kristol, who suggested that Krygier ask Josselson for money for an
Australian literary quarterly, along the lines of  "Encounter"....

"On advice from Bob Santamaria, Australia's most virulent anti-communist
campaigner, Krygier chose James McAuley as editor. He was not an obvious
choice for editor of a literary journal, since he was viewed by many in the
literary world as a mediocre poet and a Catholic fanatic. This chorus of
concern did not bother Krygier. He had no interest in poetry or religion:
it was McAuley's passionate anti-communism which really impressed him."

Louis-Ferdinand Celine. Ballets without Music, without Dancers, without =
Anything. Trans.
by Thomas and Carol Christensen. Green Integer, 1999. 187 pp. Paper =
$10.95

Celine is the great bad boy of literature, the original gangsta, =
complete with rap. And
there is much of the adolescent about his work: fascination with bodily =
functions
and scatology, ill-undirected fury, abundant energy, the preen of =
alienation. Un-
bearably bleak, clotted with polemics and obscenities, his texts =
virtually
assured rejection. Yet in many ways style and manner, like the personal =
behind
them, were a careful construct, far more complex and ambigious than =
generally
perceived. Celine was a man of the past, lamenting the loss of his =
Europe;
his portraits raveled out the rag ends of a world of which beauty was no =
longer
possible, "thick black dreams." He wrote in a delirium, febrile prose =
dropping
to the page as from a sausage grinder, his work a head-on assault upon =
all our
self-delusions. "Everything we are taught is false," Rimbaud wrote. As =
is
everything we believe and hope for, Celine might add. "It's all dance =
and
music--always at the edge of death, don't fall into it," Celine =
inscribed in a
presentation copy of Voyage au bout de la nuit.
      Fascinated by dance all his life, repeatedly he attempted to have =
ballets
staged, publishing with Gallimard in 1959 a collection of scenarios for =
same,
now translated here for the first time, wonderfully, by Thomas =
Christensen
and Carol Christensen. Just as music and all certainties of the time =
dissolve
in Ravel's La Valse, so do language and civilization in the fence posts =
of
Celine's exclamation points and the barbed wire of his ellipses. Behind
those exclamations lurk the arresting, transformative events of the =
first half
of the twentieth century, and, in those ellipses, the terminal =
discontinuities
of our time: those places where the very foundation and support beams of
our world have been torn away. (James Sallis)

Omen


In the burned-out hut, think naked Alan-and-Nikuko, speaking to the Doc-
tor: We're your meat and seafood, Doctor, no matter your name or guiding
spirit, but you're hardly anything. Come here in your soiled clothes.
Nikuko come here. Fallen Red Guards go into dark rages, "Doctor, take
Nikuko. Take her. Take her good."

Food, part and parcel of the world around us. How swollen the world is for
just a moment, how bursting, pubescent. A panic in one part of the world
affects everyone. Quakes and dark rages affect everyone. There is no con-
sciousness. Nikuko cried in sickness that she missed the very world; it
flew in all directions.

Knut Hamsun. On Overgrown Paths. Trans. by Sverre Lyngstad. Green =
Integer, 1999.
244 pp. Paper: $12.95

This swan-song memoir is the latest of Sverre Lyngstad's admirable =
translations
of Hamsun's work into English, all of which vividly convey both the =
rawness
and the lyricism of Hamsun's style and the abrupt, random shifts of his
narrator's moods. On Overgrown Paths documents the events and memories
of Hamsun's life during his 1945-1948 confinement and trial for his Nazi
affiliations in World War II. Except for some brief details of his =
arrest and
trial, Hamsun commeants very little on the political climate of Norway's
postwar years. He does, however, include a transcript of his defense
speech, which is a fascinating account of the insoluble conflict of =
obli-
gations he faced and a muted challenge to his accusers' self-exulpatory
scapegoating impulses. But most of this memoir dispenses with self-
vindication and instead reads like one of Hamsun's early novels, =
meander-
ing through the random everyday events of his life: encounters =
(sometimes
politically charged, sometimes not) with ordinary Norwegians; =
meditations
on nature's beauty; bittersweet memories of youthful friendship and=20
romance; and, above all, world-weary assessments of life, chance, and
the individual's place in history. Hamsun constantly notes that,
no matter what happens in the political sphere, the ultimate problem
of existence is one's private rendezvous with death. Whether or not
we feel we can judge Hamsun's moral and political failings, or excuse
his indirect complicity with the Holocaust, or accept his peculiar
combination of nationalism and fatalism, this memoir, like act 5 of
Hamlet or the philosophy of Schopenhauer, is the disturbingly
conforting testament of a man who is utterly fed up with existence
but has learned to accept its inevitable disappointments and in-
justices. "But let us not turn tragical in our disappointment,"
he says in a variety of ways. "The whole thing isn't worth that
much." [Thomas Hove]

This review of Jaimy Gordon's Bogeywoman appeared in the Summer 2000
issue of The Review of Contemporary Fiction, p. 169

Jaimy Gordon. Bogeywoman. Sun & Moon Press, 1999. 343 pp. Paper: $12.95

Jaimy Gordon is an extraordinary writer and Bogeywoman is her best work =
so far.
Readers familiar with the Rabelais-inspired Shamp of the City-Solo and =
her
acclaimed road novel She Drove without Stopping know that Gordon does =
not
give repeat performances. Each work presents its own set of aesthetic
possibilities, its own idea of what the novel can be.
      In the most basic terms, Bogeywoman is a fantasy-picaresque novel =
narrated
by a young woman who calls herself the Bogeywoman. The Bogeywoman dis-
covers her lesbianism at Camp Chunkagunk Tough Paradise for Girls; =
carves
up her arm and so is sent to the "bughouse"; falls in love with the =
beautiful
Madame (Dr.) Zuk, and escapes with her toward the Eastern-bloc country
of Caramel-Creamistan... In short, she moves--is constantly =
moving--through
a world that is at times familiar, at other times strange, and that by =
the end
of the book seems to have broken with reality entirely.
      There is a kind of manic energy that runs throughout Bogeywoman, =
the
source of which seems to be the narrator's bad-girl sensibility--a =
mixture of
street-smarts and naivete, cynicism and charm. For example, she composes
a song for her friend Emily, stuck in the bughouse and refusing to eat: =
"Be-
cause I couldn't stop for lunch / It kindly stopped for me. / The van =
was=20
PIAZZAS BY HASSAN / FAST FREE DELIVERY..." But most of what makes
this book so interesting cannot be paraphrased. There is something very
disturbing the evolves in the background, behind the plot's motion and
the narrator's smart-ass remarks. It's as if all of the book's wackiness =
is
insufficient veil for some sort of drippy chaos, an impressionistic =
swamp
which can (and toward the end does) overcome whatever sense of
security and normalcy readers might think they are feeling. [Martin =
Riker]

<bold>PIX

</bold> Works by

<bold>  14 artists


</bold>23 August to 23 September

 at Lance Fung Gallery, 537 Broadway


Reception for the artists: Wednesday, 23 August, 6 - 8 PM

 Gallery Hours:  Tuesday  - Saturday, 12 - 6 PM




Lance Fung Gallery is pleased to expose today's contemporary art scene
to a contemporary formation of new artists through its exhibition, PIX.
The exhibition's curator, Lance Fung, finds himself at the center of a
show jointly instigated by the permanent gallery artists at Lance Fung
Gallery and Emily Harvey Gallery. Each gallery artist has selected
another artist outside of either gallery for participation in PIX,
allowing artist-selected-artists to exhibit works within a chance
context while being positioned in the wider gallery community.


The selected artists are China Blue, Bob Braine, Rafe Churchill, Devon
Dikeou, Jonathan Feldschuh, Franky Kong, William Pope L., Minaliza1000,
Jeff Perkins, Eliza Proctor, Kristine Roepstorff, Adam Smith, Suzy
Sureck and Paul Welsh.


Unlike many group shows, PIX has challenged each artist to fabricate an
original work specifically for this exhibition. One might expect a
group of site works in one space to be an overcrowded experience, yet
PIX presents a clear and clean surface. Ideas of space, optics,
location and disorientation are just a few of the interests developed
in the individual works of art and PIX as a group show.


Media include sound, video, sculpture, installation, drawing, painting
and outdoor work. Devon Dikeou covers the entire floor of the main
gallery with ceiling tin, turning the experience of a group exhibition
into something unexpected. While Ms. Dikeou's installation is a visual
tour de force, it also serves as a sound work and process work when
viewers walk on it. China Blue fills the main space with a work which
compliments Jeff Perkins' sound work in the rear gallery.


Bob Braine, Rafe Churchill, Jonathan Feldschuh, Franky Kong, William
Pope L., Minaliza1000, Eliza Proctor, Kristine Roepstorff, Adam Smith,
Suzy Sureck and Paul Welsh present extensive works ranging from two
dimensional imagery to concept, process, sculpture and ephemera further
widening the scope of the exhibition.

Kenning is pleased to announce the first in the Kenning summer chapbook
series, hovercraft, a long serial poem by K. Silem Mohammad.  hovercraft is
published as Kenning #8 (Vol. 3, No. 2 [ISSN:  1526-3428]) and is available
at $6.00 / per.  The first pressing, featuring durable, hand-printed jackets
designed by Andrea Troolin, is limited to 100.  Also note:  issues 6 (the
“Cunning” issue) and 7 (the “odd” issue) are still available at $6.00 / per
– collectively, they feature work from Jackson Mac Low, Mary Burger, Akilah
Oliver, Susan Briante, Brian Strang, Tisa Bryant, Sarah Jane Lapp, Betsy
Fagin, Rod Smith, Jean Donnelly, Buck Downs, Keith Waldrop, Lytle Shaw,
Habib Tengour, and numerous others.  Order now:  checks payable to the
editor, Patrick F. Durgin.  Kenning’s new home office (to which all
correspondence should be sent) is 24 Norwood Avenue #3, Buffalo, NY 14222
USA.  Subscription information is available below.

On hovercraft:  In reply to a signal epigraph to the book from a poem by
Carl Rakosi, Mohammad picks "up the signet of these hanging contras / and
bale[s] into words." The result is a book which resists safe nomenclature
such as 'post-language' or 'nth generation New York School' – nor does it
perform an exercise of reconciliation of whatever these schools sponsor by
way of influence, be it a re-politicized Objectivism or an American sublime
in the quotidian. hovercraft, instead, offers a virulently infectious joy in
the word and a relentless engendering of meaning in the world. Carefully
observant, perversely comic, responsive to difference, and riding the crest
of its own resistant textures, Mohammad's verse is propelled by a
near-Cratyllic economy of verbal praxis in which concision takes on a new
guise. As usual, the author puts it best: "in expedition, freshness."
Sometimes baffling in its furtive leaps and always exhilarating in its
strange tunefulness, hovercraft is a very powerful and promising first
chapbook from this emerging poet.

Subscriptions pay for the production and distribution of the newsletter.
Subscribe to Kenning at $12.00 / 2 issues, or $24.00 / 4.  If you subscribe
now at the standard rate, your subscription will begin with the summer
issue.  And, as with many small-press ventures, your contribution is matched
by that of the publisher -- Kenning is perforce a not-for-profit enterprise.

On Kenning:  Kenning is published 3 times annually with the summer issue
being a single-author chapbook.  Interested in new writing as progressive
social discourse, Kenning seeks to draw together work from newer and
established authors, some of which featured in the past & future being:
Stefani Barber, Charles Bernstein, Taylor Brady, Garrett Caples, Clark
Coolidge, Lyn Hejinian, Richard Kostelanetz, Eileen Myles, Hoa Nguyen,
Juliana Spahr, John Taggart, Edwin Torres, & Ida Yoshinaga.  And, coming
soon, the Duration Press chapbook series preview project, featuring
selections from this exciting series of international poetry in translation,
neatly ensconced in every spring issue.

I'm not so sure the arbitrary is necessarily illogical, or that "life
doesn't."  As for life, I suppose it depends on what we're talking about,
life as biological event, or our seemingly individual perceptions of it.  The
latter may be the only jiggle available to us.  And those perceptions are
vague, specific, logical or illogical, contingent upon who is doing da
tinkin', I guess.  I see so many student poems, for example, that are little
more than dense blobs of verbiage with no sense of control and development.
They all look alike, read alike.  "Avant garde" aesthetics can be freeing,
but in the wrong hands they often conceal an embarrassing lack of talent,
skill and intelligence.  Of course Sartre and Valery were masters.  But I get
your point, and I still think you're a pretty bright guy, so it has been an
honor to trade fours with you.  Let's move on.  Best, Bill

Eureka!

The Poetics List's 'bureau of research and development' is pleased
to announce several important changes in subscription options -
detailed below - the chief interest of which will be the new
allowance of messages formatted using Hypertext Markup Language,
commonly known as HTML.
      What follows is especially relevant to Digest subscribers,
all of whom will need to change their digest option from text-only
to MIME or HTML digest, as detailed in the following instructions.
The new digest forms have been tested with a variety of email
applications including Mulberry, Eudora, and Pine, and perform
well with all.

These changes need to be made as soon as possible. I will endeavor
to keep the list clear of HTML formatting for the next week, until
Monday, 21 August; on and after this date, HTML will be allowed on
the list. Anyone receiving the digest in traditional, text-only form
after that date will find that form displays rather than interprets
the HTML tags - in other words, it makes of messages thus formatted
a half-legible mess.
      Please attempt to make this change in your subscription yourself;
I will be on hand throughout the week to assist those of you who
experience difficulty in so doing - but, given the number of digest
subscribers, and the lack of any prescripted method for performing
this operation en masse, I cannot make all of the necessary
changes myself.

Thanks for your assistance. This is an exciting change, and I for
one look forward to its impact on the list!

Excerpt from the Welcome Message as updated 18 August 2000:

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each post.
To change options, send a one-line message, always beginning with
"set" with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

With a "regular" subscription, you receive individual postings
immediately, as they are processed by LISTSERV. To change to this
option if you are currently not getting the list in this form send
the one-line message:

set poetics nodigest

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day or once per
week. These "digests" are collections of individual list postings.
Some lists are so active that they produce several digests per day.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

There are three digest formats: a "traditional", text-only format;
a MIME format; and an HTML format. Because posts sent over the list
with HTML coding disrupt the format of the text-only digest, we
recommend that you use the MIME or html versions. If your mail reader
works with HTML, choose that; if not, try MIME, although you may find
the HTML version will also work for you.

To change your digest options, send these messages to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

Digest (traditional): set poetics digest [We DO NOT recommend this]
Digest (MIME format): set poetics nohtml mime digest
Digest (HTML format) set poetics html digest

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive short "index" messages
at regular intervals, usually once per day or once per week. These
"indexes" show you what is being discussed on the list, without
including the text of the individual postings. For each posting,
the date, the author's name and address, the subject of the message
and the number of lines is listed. You can then follow instructions
provided in the index to download messages of interest from the
server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

Send the "set" to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

        Index (traditional): set poetics nohtml index
        Index (HTML format): set poetics html index

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

        set poetics nodigest

NOTE!! Send these messages to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>,
and not to the Poetics List or as a reply to this message!!

Abashed and synonyms of that, I have to say thanks to Ron Silliman
for his remarks on my recent book.

When Bromige left for home after several days in my abode last week,
he left his copy behind. But it wont work; I just wrapped it up to
mail to him in Sebastopol.

Eliot,Williams (his Breuhgal poem and his very "visual"

there's Joanna Paul who is in both media,and Wystan Curnow,Michelle Leggott

inspired by or predicated on visual Art.Blake is pretty obvious if you can
even get facsimiles of the originals.I'm in 2nd Hnd books so might be able
to source books.Your course sounds interesting so I'll keep thinking.Another
interesting (current)thing is Miriam Bellard's architectural "poem" based on
Tristram Shandy.See: http://homepages.ihug.co.nz\~mbellard\ In fact Miriam
is doing a PhD in Architecture,and is very talented.There's also intereting

you got or read "Black Riders The Visible Language of Modernism" by Jerome

Alan Loney of N.Z. who was deeply involved both in printing and
poetry.Robert Creeley knows him.Best wishes,Richard Taylor.

William Gaddis's _The Recognitions_ may be a bit much
for a survey course to integrate, but it certainly
represents the visual artist.

I'd have to write at length on these ideas we're exchanging.But briefly - I admit I was a bit cryptic - the I.P. is a growing thing and moves (ultimately) beyond me the author, or initiator. So I move away from the idea of "better" writing. I get on with what I'm doing. (trying to sell secnd hnd books (quality)) and read widely and keep my cat fed and women at bay! (Joke).I also tutor maths and english. I was an Eng. Tech. then took a B.A. in English.(1995) I've published in some local mags and also in a mag called "Pica" which I think is still going in Chicago. Scott Hamilton (I know!) has published some of my stuff.I've also done a lot of public readings in Auckland. Michelle Leggott,Roger Horrocks,Alan Loney,Wystan Curnow were some of my lecturers and I admire there work. Also Murray Edmond.There are others of course.Michael Arnold,Hamish Dewe,and Scott Hamilton are some others.
 I think its healthy to talk about onself. Perhaps not too much. I'm always interested in other people. I believe in openness. I will say that too many writers (and others) are too closed off and/or limit there interests. I dont get depression and I dont worry about anything. I never plan much. Always ready to experience things. I like Charles Ives's music as much as Handel's or even some "crazy" heavy rock or whatever. Interested in a wide range of art e.g some of the conceptual atrists interest me, and so on. I'm reading Pat Barker's Regeneration series and Richard Dawkin's "Climbing Mount Improbable." I'm a plodder but I read widely. I'll get a copy of your books. You sound an interesting fulla. Best wishes, Richard.

Subject:      Quid 5
Comments: To: British-Poets List <british-poets@mailbase.ac.uk>

Just got a copy of _Quid_ 5 in the post today--one of the better issues, I
think: most intriguing is the opening contribution, a long letter by JH
Prynne to Andrew George concerning his recent translation of the _Epic of
Gilgamesh_ (published by Penguin).  It's a translation that's been widely
praised, & Prynne writes to compliment George on it, but also to offer
different interpretations of certain cruxes, & to suggest a different
reading of the poem's message than that given in George's preface.  It's a
fine & invigorating letter, rather less knotty than usual for Prynne's
prose.  A passing enthusiastic reference to _Beowulf_ reminds me of a
conversation I had with Prynne this spring in which he expressed great anger
about the distortions visited on that poem by Heaney & the attendant
media-circus.  A poem that clearly meant a lot to him; as does _Gilgamesh_
it would seem.

The issue also has "California Tonking," a long & interesting review of
Clark Coolidge's _On the Nameways_ by Drew Milne--not an author one expects
to get much of a look-in in Cambridge quarters, perhaps, & the piece is both
admiring & often uncomfortable.  If I don't always agree with Milne, I think
the piece is one of the most substantial pieces of criticism written on
Coolidge in some time.

The issue also contains a piece on Chris Emery's _The Cutting Room_ by
Keston Sutherland (which, typically for Keston, is written on a larger scale
than that might suggest, sketching out larger theses about phenomenology,
Silliman's New Sentence, Marxism); & poems from the stable of Barque Press
authors--Emery, Sutherland, Brady, Mirakove.

End of report--time to give the 2-year-old her bath.  The mag's address is

Advance notice on Living Root:

        "In the subtle resources of this articulate poet's testament, one voice
again speaks for all" --Robert Creeley

        "....he proves that American English may be the major 'Jewish' language of
the late twentieth century."
--Sander Gilman, The University of Chicago

        "...at any moment a paragraph will open far afield--to the Babel of
language, to kaballah, to Walter Benjamin--or an interwoven poem will give
the autobiography lyric depth and concentration..."-- John Felstiner, author
of Paul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew.

        "...a work of crossings, hauntings, reanimations: a mighty golem walking
the lost Jewish streets of Brooklyn and Miami Beach." --Norman Finkelstein,

Literature.

>I made an error here. I meant my father commented on the incident.In the days there was no television in N.Z. The biggest race thing here in N.Z. was the 1981 Springbok Rugby tour in which I was battened inthe face. A football field in Auckland was bombed by a pilot called Marx(!)and there were battles with the police. In Hamilton those who invaded a football pitch to stop the game were beaten and called "communists","jews", and "niggers" etc. So much for the "nice" image N.Z. has. The race thing is unresolved. The Maori suffered a similar (perhaps not quite so drastic) fate as the Aussie aboriginees and the American Indians. Its interesting that according to Michael King,historian, they never actually lost a battle per se. Mostly they outwitted the British. They were defeated by trickery (not by all Pakehas),numbers,corruption,religion, and diseases introduced. In the last 10 years, with the intro. of what is called "Rogernomics", or free trade taken to the nth, there has b
 een a drastic decline in the well being of Maori and poor Pakeha. And over the whole population N.Z. has the highest suicide rate in the Western (if not the whole) world.
 Still, all's not bad, but the present Govt. is a bit timid indealing with socio-economic matters.
 However, this is a rather bleak view...N.Z.rs are still by and large fortunate to live here and it is a good country to visit. Not as quite as when my mother came in 1939 when she thought Auckland was a village. But smaller than Melbourne for example. As long as we keep an eye on the politicos, things are stilly pretty good. No bombings of Chuches thank the relevant power. And writing "good" or
"bad" poetry isn't subject to tax yet! So there's my penny ha'penny's worth.my English grandmother used to say:"A penny for your thoughts",and "go on with you!".Best wishes, Richard Taylor.

The declarative sentence, the statement, the clear interrogative, have
run their course. What can be meant by this?

Only that gaps open among words, that spaces lead to other spaces, that
language itself is wounded, that every word links elsewhere, pulls hard
at the skein, harder at the skin.

This is the critical problem of contemporary thought: the unmooring of
language, untethering of thought, which wanders blindly among surfaces.

There is no return; language is unpunctuated, phrases slide obscenely
(perhaps) upon each other, every word is skewed with every other. No
longer is the difference a function of two variables; instead, it is an
accumulation of partial and occluded signs whose deferrals slide into
non-existence.

Languaging slides from an accumulation of words, proprietary signifiers,
protocols; the sentence has already disappeared. One letter shudders,
stutters, against another; pronouns lose antecedents, precedents; nouns
lose referents.

Descending into chaotic phenomena, ontology is undermined; everything is
relativized - meaning, for example, becomes tied and taut to the attri-
bute, and nouns are referenced by upgrades. This is not only a phenomen-
on of electronic communication and high-speed technology; it has become
a characteristic subtext (also subject to revision) of our time (always
already lost prior to enumeration).

No longer crying for our lost language, after the hiatus between two
world wars.

Thinking slides among symbols, harbors none; surfaces slide as well.
What passes for thought is afterthought, a salvage-operation. Every
instantiation leads to every other; information occludes itself. Tracks
are traces of the infinite, just as the aphorism opens itself to depths
of interconnected and rhizomatic tunnelings. Nothing emerges, nothing is
brought up, nothing is capable of existing after unmoorings.

Among the ghosts, ghosts. Among languagings, memories of languages, the
"just" as I was "about" to say ...

Such is the only conceivable critical thought of our time-revised, such
is the problem, to the extent it is a memory.

Dear List Members

In a rare posting to the list a few months back, Barrett Watten announced
publication of Part I of Poetics Today's special double issue on "Poetics
of Avant-Garde Poetries," which includes his "The Secret History of the
Equal Sign: L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE between Discourse and Text." Part=
 II, for which
I've guest edited a special section under the title "Aftershock: Poetry and
Cultural Politics since 1989," is now also available. Duke University Press
has agreed to offer list members a 20% discount for either or both issues
($9.60 rather than the usual $12.00 each), contents of which are given
below. To order, write to subscription@dukeupress.edu, specifying the
volume title and number and being sure to mention that you're a member of
the list. I have offprints of my own contribution on hand and would be
happy to send to any list members who might be interested. Please let me
know backchannel if you would like to receive a copy.

I was finally brave enough to assign Gaddis's first novel a couple years ago in a class on the 50s & 60s -- Thought since we were discussing metafictions we should work our way through at least one of the more meta of them -- made for interesting connections to our other readings as well -- Gaddis appears as a character in Kerouac's SUBTERRANEANS, for example -- I had only taught CARPENTER'S GOTHIC in undergraduate courses previously (but have tuaght JR to grad. seminars with happy results) -- RECOGNITIONS is one of the best for discussions of art and representation generally --


It was rough going for a few of the students, but others became instant Gaddis fanatics -- It helps that there is an extensive guide to this novel posted on-line --

By the way -- A FROLIC OF HIS OWN is available in a good paperback now --

A brief, final report on that mis-directed "review"
of subscribers' addresses: we were able, by special
dispensation of the listserv administrator at UB's
Computing and Information Technology office, to
have that errant message removed from the online
archive; a service that - as I have been informed
carefully - is not usually available to us, owing
to its difficulty of execution.

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange
arise Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

1. About the Poetics List

With the preceeding epigraph, the Poetics List was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its second incarnation,
the list carries over 800 subscribers worldwide, though all of these
subscribers do not necessarily receive messages at any given time.
A number of other people read the Poetics List via our web archives
at the Electronic Poetry Center (see section 10 below).

Please note that this is a private list and information about
the list should not be posted to other lists or directories of
lists. The idea is to keep the list to those with specific
rather than general interests, and also to keep the scale of
the list relatively small and the volume manageable.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Due to the increasing
number of subscribers, we are no longer able to maintain the
open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
All submissions are reviewed by the moderators in keeping with
the goals of the list, as articulated in this Welcome Message.
We remain committed to this editorial function as a defining
element of the Poetics List. Our aim is to support, inform, and
extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of
the otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and
impossible.

For further information on posting to the list, see sections 3 and 4.
below. Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 8.

In addition to being archived at the EPC, some posts to Poetics
(especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.) may
also become part of specific EPC subject areas. Brief reviews of
poetry events and publications are always welcome. See section 8
for details.

We recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange in this still-new medium. We request that those
participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focussed nature of this project. For subscription information
or to contact the moderators, write to <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

2. Subscriptions

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but
formal registration is required. We ask that when you subscribe
you provide your full name, street address, email address, and
telephone number. All posts to the list should provide your full
real name, as registered. If there is any discrepancy between
your full name as it appears in the "from" line of the message
header, please sign your post at the bottom.

To subscribe to the Poetics List, please contact the moderators
at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>. Your message should include all
of the required information. Please allow several days for your
new or re-subscription to take effect.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

To unsubscribe, send this one-line message, with no "subject"
line to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     unsub poetics

*If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your
system administrator. If this happens you will not be able to
send messages to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address, then return to your new
address and send this one-line message, with no "subject" line
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     sub poetics Phil Spillway

Remember to replace "Phil Spillway" with your own name. If you
find that it is not possible to unsub using your old address,
please contact the editors at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>
for assistance.

*Eudora users: if your email address has been changed, you may
still be able to unsubscribe without assistance. Go to the
"Tools" menu in Eudora, select "Options" and then select setup
for "Sending Mail": you may be able to temporarily substitute
your old address here to send the unsub message.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages.
If your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota,
Poetics messages may get bounced. Please try avoid having
messages from the list returned to us. If the problem is low
disk quota, you may wish to request an increased quota from
your system administrator. (University subscribers may wish to
argue that this subscription is part of your scholarly
communication!) You might also consider obtaining a commercial
account. In general, if a Poetics message is bounced from your
account, your subscription to Poetics will be temporarily
suspended. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by
contacting the moderators at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

All questions about subscriptions, whether about an individual
subscription or subscription policy, should be addressed to
the list's administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.
Please note that it may take up to ten days, or more, for us
to reply to messages.

-------------------

3. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by
the moderators in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated
in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and political
activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome. Feel
free to query the list moderators if you are uncertain as to whether
a message is appropriate. All correspondence with the editors
regarding submissions to the list remains confidential and should
be directed to us at <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

We encourage subscribers to post information on publications
and reading series that they have coordinated, edited, published,
or in which they appear. Such announcements constitute a core
function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications
are always welcome. We also welcome discussions of poetry and poetics
in keeping with the editorial function of the list.

Solicited contributions (by subscribers or non-subscribers) may
also appear on Poetics from time to time. The moderators reserve
the right to contact any subscriber regarding possible contributions.

Send messages to the list directly to the list address:

     <poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu>

Please do not send messages intended for posting to the list
to our administrative address <poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

For further information on posting to the list, see section 4 below.
Publishers and series co-ordinators, see also section 9.

-------------------

4. Cautions

It may take up to a week or more to respond to your questions
or to subscription requests or to handle any other editorial
business or any nonautomated aspect of list maintenance.

Please do not send attachments or include extremely long
documents (1,000+ words) in a post, since this may make it
difficult for those who get the list via "digest" or who
cannot decode attached or specially formatted files.
Messages containing attachments will be presumed to be
worm- or virus-carrying and will not be forwarded to the list.

Posting on the list is a form of publication. However, please do
not publish list postings without the express permission of the author!
Copyright for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author;
material from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without
the author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair
use" of published materials.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 5 messages
per day from any one subscriber; in general, we expect subscribers
to keep their post to less than 10-15 posts per month. Our goal is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers)
of twenty-five or fewer messages per day.

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. In
this category are included messages gratuitously attacking
fellow listees, also messages designed to "waste bandwidth" or
cause the list to reach its daily limit. These messages are
considered offensive and detrimental to list discussion. Offending
subscribers will receive only one warning message. Repeat offenders
will be removed from the list immediately. Please do not put this
policy to test!

Like all machines, the listserver will sometimes be down: if
you feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait
at least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive
to be sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel
there is a problem, you may wish to contact the moderators at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

-------------------

5. Subscription Options

It is possible to receive the Poetics List as separate posts
or as daily digests. When you subscribe, the default setting is
"regular," meaning you will receive a separate email for each post.
To change options, send a one-line message, always beginning with
"set" with no "subject" line to

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

With a "regular" subscription, you receive individual postings
immediately, as they are processed by LISTSERV. To change to this
option if you are currently not getting the list in this form send
the one-line message:

set poetics nodigest

Digest:
With a "digest" subscription, you receive larger messages (called
"digests") at regular intervals, usually once per day or once per
week. These "digests" are collections of individual list postings.
Some lists are so active that they produce several digests per day.

Digests are a good compromise between reading everything as it is
posted and feeling like the list is clogging your mailbox with a
multitude of individual postings.

There are three digest formats: a "traditional", text-only format;
a MIME format; and an HTML format. Because posts sent over the list
with HTML coding disrupt the format of the text-only digest, we
recommend that you use the MIME or html versions. If your mail reader
works with HTML, choose that; if not, try MIME, although you may find
the HTML version will also work for you.

To change your digest options, send these messages to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

Digest (traditional): set poetics digest [We DO NOT recommend this]
Digest (MIME format): set poetics nohtml mime digest
Digest (HTML format) set poetics html digest

Index:
With an "index" subscription, you receive short "index" messages
at regular intervals, usually once per day or once per week. These
"indexes" show you what is being discussed on the list, without
including the text of the individual postings. For each posting,
the date, the author's name and address, the subject of the message
and the number of lines is listed. You can then follow instructions
provided in the index to download messages of interest from the
server.

An index subscription is ideal if you have a slow connection and
only read a few hand-picked messages. The indexes are very short
and you do not have to worry about long download times. The drawback
of course is that you need to maintain your internet connection or
reconnect to order messages of interest from the server.

You can choose to have the index sent to you in either a traditional
format (plain text) or in HTML format with hyperlinks. Using the HTML
index, you may click on a link provided with each message to open your
web browser to that message in the Poetics List archive.

Send the "set" to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

      Index (traditional): set poetics nohtml index
      Index (HTML format): set poetics html index

You can switch back to individual messages by sending this
message:

      set poetics nodigest

NOTE!! Send these messages to "listserv" not to Poetics or
as a reply to this Welcome Message!!

-------------------

6. Temporarily turning off Poetics mail

Please do not leave your Poetics subscription "active" if you are
going to be away for any extended period of time! Your account
may become flooded and you may lose not only Poetics messages
but other important mail.

You can temporarily turn off your Poetics subscription by
sending this one-line message, with no "subject" line, to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

     set poetics nomail

You may re-activate your poetics subscription by sending this
one-line message, with no "subject" line, to the same address:

     set poetics mail

When you return you can check or download missed postings from
the Poetics archive. (See section 9 below.)

-------------------

7. "No Review" policy

For the safety and security of list subscribers, the "review"
function of the Poetics List has been de-activated. Non-posting
subscribers' email addresses will remain confidential. Please
do not ask the list editors to give out subscriber addresses or
other personal information.

-------------------

8. What is the Electronic Poetry Center?

The World Wide Web-based Electronic Poetry Center is located at
<http://epc.buffalo.edu>.

The EPC's mission is to serve as a gateway to the extraordinary
range of activity in formally innovative writing and digital media
poetry in the United States and around the world. The Center provides
access to extensive resources in new poetries. These include our
E-POETRY library, our links to digital VIDEO and SOUND (including
our award-winning LINEbreak series of radio interviews and performances)
as well as e-journals such as lume, Deluxe Rubber Chicken, Alyricmailer,
and many others, the POETICS List archives, an AUTHOR library of
electronic poetry texts and bibliographies, and direct connections
to numerous related electronic RESOURCES. The Center also provides
information about contemporary electronic poetry magazines and print
little magazines and SMALL PRESSES engaged in poetry and poetics.
Visit the EPC's many libraries, the featured resources available on
the EPC home page, or its NEW listings, where recent additions are
available for quick access.

The EPC is directed by Loss Peque=F1o Glazier.

-------------------

9. Poetics Archives at the EPC

Go to the Electronic Poetry Center <http://epc.buffalo.edu>
and select the "Poetics" link from the opening screen. Follow the
links to Poetics Archives. Or set your browser to go directly to
<http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html>.

You may browse the Poetics List archives by month and year or
search them for specific information. Your interface will allow
you to print or download any of these files.

Please note that it is possible to toggle between proportional
and non-proportional fonts in viewing archived messages; a
feature that may be useful to interpret messages reliant on
the neat spacing of a proportional font, or that require the
"word wrap" feature of same - and useful, too, for aesthetic
reasons. To change the display font of an archived message,
simply follow the "proportional font" or "non-proportional font"
link at the top of the message.

Tony. You know I gave out John's email adresss which may be the wrong number
but it was published on ABDOTWW so my object was to spread the word about
it.(The mag,unless you guys have lost it like the crazy eco terrorist in
Finland) . The Yank's think we're crazy enough without us getting paranoid
about email "adresses". I didnt say ABDOWW had a web site. Nor do you or I
 at least I dont). Relax and I might shout you a steiny at anyplace we read.
Come to the Temple on Queen St. Auckland (and anyone visiting N.Z.) 1st Sun
every month. Also The Alleyluyah every Wed night. Open readings at both.
Bonus, you might meet me before I get completely sozzled. Regards,Richard.

I worked for a Govt. Dept and one of my bosses, English, was a bit cynical.
He said: "In Russia your not allowed say what you think, and in America you
can say anything but nobody listens." Is the U.S. more advanced than China?
Which is best, freedom or afull stomach. What do the anti-communists mean
about "freedom". Which is better, Capitalism or Communism. Has Communism
ever existed? We've got a "healthy" democracy but the petro price keeps
going up, we've got the highest youth suicide rate, only the rich can afford
university, the whitesa hate asians,and the exchange rate keeps dropping cf
the Brit pound. So I'm a bit skeptical about these "nice" Chinese
intellectuals. I've met many Chinese who think very highly of their country,
and most are not impressed with certain military activities of the U.S. Nor
am I. I think China is a major country in all senses of that
expression.Maybe he was trying to subvert the system. So He'd be arrested in
the U.S. for that as well. Richard Taylor.

Tony. I just tried the link and got Asia Online so I'll have to apologise. I
must have got the editor's old email adress. So I misinterpreted what you
said. but dont you think you should give at least a post box address of
ABDOWW?  But you were right, that was the incorrect adress. But my intention
was to promote ABD. But you guys do what you like.Regards, Richard.

Some somewhat dated information on Bei Ling's background - his student
activism at Shenzhen University, his exile & blacklisting by the Chinese
government, can be found at:

www.brown.edu/Departments/English/Writing/walking.html

Apparently, his blacklist status made him subject to immediate arrest upon
return to China.  The blacklist was imposed back in 1989.

Anyone interested in the situation of poet Bei Ling and his brother, arrested
recently in Beijing, supposedly for their publishing activities, might note
the US goodwill tour organized by the gov't of China & sponsored by what
the NY Times today called "a Who's Who of corporate America" (see article
on p. A3 today, Aug 23rd Times).  The tour is a p.r. project for the
new business-friendly China, & will include exhibitions at the Javits
Center in NYC, and q & a with a "top Chinese gov't official" in Washington,
along with events in several other US cities.  Those of you who live in
NYC might want to flyer the Javits event with info from the Times articles
I mentioned in earlier post (from Sat. Aug 15, pp. A5 and A29).

WHAT ABOUT BEI LING ?

Oh Richard, I said you were formidable--this confirms.  I don't know all the
details here, but your point that things are never so simple should be
considered by all.  We here in the US, so convinced that our way is the only
way are, perhaps, the propaganda stooges of all time.  Perhaps.  Whatever the
truth is, when the knee jerks, watch out!  Best, Bill

Hi,

Does anybody have titles to go with this author? Is her name spelled wrong?
Also, does anyone have more info on who this author might be:

"The woman who wrote that black box cutaway book (I have no idea what
her name is)"

This came from a fellow Listee. Does anyone have a clue? Is it Meredith
Stricker?

Thanks,

Pete

I should while I'm plugging the journal mention that enthusiasts of JH
Prynne can also get his latest book from Barque at the same
address--_Triodes_.  I recommend it, as being with _Pearls That Were_ his
most immediately engaging work for some time--it offers considerably more
footholds than _Her Weasels Wild Returning_ & _Red D Gypsum_, which still
leave me scratching my head mostly.  A set of ode-like poems in three parts
(hey, honesty in advertising!), involving the paired female figures of
Pandora and Irene.  The book is worth having if only for containing the
worst pun in the entire Prynne oeuvre ("lemon Kurds").

all best --N

I'm sorry, but I think that's outrageous.  It doesn't matter what you think
of the US, or Chinese communism for that matter.  A violation of human
rights is a violation of human rights-- in this case, being arrested for
having committed no crime.  The fact that something very similar can happen
here-- *has* happened here (c.f. Philadelphia during the Republikkkan
convention) doesn't have a goddamned thing to do with it.  Would you
backpedal what happened in Tiennamen Square in similar fashion?  & What
would you think about someone, say an ardent capitalist, making excuses for
injustices American style?

(apologies for cross-posting)



Internet Culture and Community Course


-- I will be teaching an online course for Adult University, over a period
of 8 or so weeks this fall. Its cost is nominal - $34. I imagine it to be
quirky, somewhat non-academic, but with enough information and energy to
keep people going.

-- The course will be taught through weekly online meetings, but I am
hoping that we can set up email aliases so that the students and I can all
mail each other - in other words, a primitive email list. We might be able
to find a better home in a while, but this would do. Through the list, we
can have somewhat ongoing discussions, and I can send out papers, etc. as
well. (The list might also work well for those who can't make the chats,
but want to participate in the class.)

-- To take this, in other words, you need email (otherwise you probably
couldn't read this!) - and enough familiarity with your email box to make
an alias address list. (This is nothing more than, say, entering "family"
in the address line, and having it expand to the addresses of your various
family members.)

-- Meanwhile, given how little Adult University is asking, you should at
least be entertained for a while!

-- The following information is found at the site, and the URL is given
below.

Thanks, Alan (sondheim@panix.com)

NEW NOVEL, ROUGHHOUSE, BY THADDEUS RUTKOWSKI, EXAMINES FETISH, VIOLENCE,
AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY IN ROT
Rutkowski laces his in-your-face punk realism with touches of the surreal
and subversive black humor. Sex is emotional karate, social intercourse is
toxic... His sulfuric tale of family breakdown and fetishism chronicles the
confusion and opacity of traumatic childhood even as it criticizes the
American society that tolerates such inhumanity."- Publishers Weekly

"What is most startling about Roughhouse is that it seems too realistic to
be a novel, and yet too unsettling to be completely factual. He's like our
modern day Marquis de Sade...who mixes reality and fantasy so
intricatelythat he becomes our guide...."
- Hal Sirowitz, author of Mother Said

"...Roughhouse proves that the experimental, even shocking, comic novel is
alive and well in America..." - Alison Lurie
"In Roughhouse, Thaddeus Rutkowski brings a poet's sensibilities to a
funny, perversely erotic and compelling story of an American family.
Rutkowski's startling images stayed with me long after I'd turned the last
page."- Shay Youngblood
alfred vitale, former editor of RANT, member of the Unbearables, co-editor
of the upcoming anthology "Help Yourself!", a satirical deconstruction of
self-help movements being published by Autonomedia Press, recent work
appeared in the book "Chick for a Day" published by Simon and Schuster, and
in the "Outlaw's Bible of American Poetry". He has appeared in numerous
journals, magazines, and other media outlets and currently lives in
Philadelphia with hiswife, Betty, and their daughter Sofi.

er, you certainly did include it;  but not being in touch w. these
folks, i didn't realize Sutherland was also Quid... (so i guess i
wasn't very clear *what* the address was doing there... But i'm used
to being confused by people's posts on listservs, they often are
kinda shuffled and garbled looking, by the time they pass from one

 You mentioned a piece of his that appeared in the issue, but that he

Starting today, Monday 28 August 2000, the poetics list
will accept HTML or "styled" text. If you are getting the

your subscription option to one that can read styled text.

To change your digest options, send one of these two

<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

set poetics nohtml mime digest

OR

An alternative is the INDEX, which will send you just the
author/subject head for each method. The HTML index has
clickable links to the archive and is recommended if your
mail reader will support such links. The nonhtml index is
just a text list.

Send the "set" to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>:

name mispelled, should be "Albiach". In English best access to her work is
her collection MEZZA VOCE (translated by Joseph Simas in collab with Anthony
Barnett, Lydia Davis & Douglas Oliver) published by The Post-Apollo Press.
Not sure if the previous Ebnglish translation, her book ETAT (trans. by
Keith Waldrop; Awede 1988) is still in print. A GEOMETRY, translated by
Rosmarie & Keith Waldrop & publishe dby Burning Deck in their Série
d'Ecriture, Supplement #3 in 1998 should still be available.
Albiach is a major poet and very much worthwhile seeking out. -- Pierre

Come on, Marc.  I don't think Richard was saying we shouldn't help if we so
desire.  I read his reply as a reminder that not all things are as they
appear.  We should get the facts, and think long and hard before committing
ourselves.  And I, for one, suspect that it has become extremely difficult to
get the facts in the USA.  Your response above, for example, contains several
terms, e.g., "human rights," "crime," that are open to interpretive field
days.  My own impulse is to contribute.  But I still remember how SDS back in
my college days told us to invade the classrooms of astonished and frightened
professors.  "If they refuse to let you interrupt their classes, just push
them out the door."  I quit on the spot.  And I'm not suggesting the Chinese
poet or anyone necessarily falls into that category.  Perhaps you know the
situation far more intimately than do a lot of other people.  But I'd have to
investigate on my own, and wait until I am very satisfied that my results are
trustworthy.  I won't act until I hear all sides.  And Richard's point is
worth considering.  After all, we don't want to suppress one segment of the
discourse, do we?  These days it seems the moral high ground is a pretty
lonely place.  Best, Bill

I think you're referring to the French poet, whose name is (if I remember
correctly -- and I'm bad with spellings) Albiach; I'll check and bring
titles in next week if someone else doesn't beat me to it.  She's much
admired in the avant-garde community both in France and here in the U.K.

"That Black Box Cutaway woman" is Susan Gevirtz. The book is published by
Kelsey Street Press, and well worth a read.

And yes, the spelling for the other name is "Albiach." The SPD catalog
online at www.spdbooks.org shows the following available:

Vocative Figure. (Allardyce, Barnett. 1993)
<> (Moving Letters [limited edition])
A Discursive, Space (Duration. 1999) - conversations on poetics with Jean
Daive
A Geometry (Burning Deck, 1998)
Etat (Awede, 1989)
Mezza Voce (Post-Apollo. 1988)

I'd recommend Etat and Mezza Voce as introductions to her work, but that's
largely a matter of what I've read. Perhaps other listoids have a better
acquaintance with her writing. Also, I'm fairly sure there's prose on/by her
in the anthology of writing on French poetry by Norma Cole, forthcoming (?)
from Burning Deck. Title, anyone?

Does anybody have titles to go with this author? Is her name spelled wrong?
Also, does anyone have more info on who this author might be:

This came from a fellow Listee. Does anyone have a clue? Is it Meredith

...or for that matter, making American-style excuses for injustices Chinese
style. One of the particularly ugly aspects of New Economy conventional
wisdom here on the Leftover Coast is the ideological assertion that Chinese
state capitalism = good, while Stalinist state capitalism =(ed) bad, largely
on the basis of the Chinese state's willingness to "do business." Ugh.

I'm sorry, but I think that's outrageous.  It doesn't matter what you think
of the US, or Chinese communism for that matter.  A violation of human
rights is a violation of human rights-- in this case, being arrested for
having committed no crime.  The fact that something very similar can happen
here-- *has* happened here (c.f. Philadelphia during the Republikkkan
convention) doesn't have a goddamned thing to do with it.  Would you
backpedal what happened in Tiennamen Square in similar fashion?  & What
would you think about someone, say an ardent capitalist, making excuses for
injustices American style?

Anne-Marie Albiach (NOT "Ahlbairch") b. 1937.  A contemporary of the
generation of French poets that included Hocquard, Royet-Journoud, etc.  One
of her major works is the long poem _État_.  I understand that she's also
translated the likes of Zukofsky & O'Hara into French.  I'm sure others on
this list could give you more information.

Yes and yes: her name is Anne-Marie Albiach, and she's been translated by
Norma Cole, including in the CROSSCUT UNIVERSE anthology mentioned on this
list recently in the "New From Burning Deck Press" post. Norma Cole has
also translated full books of Albiach's, but I don't know any of the titles
offhand.

>Also, does anyone have more info on who this author might be:
>
>"The woman who wrote that black box cutaway book (I have no idea what
>her name is)"

Yes: Susan Gevirtz. (BLACK BOX CUTAWAY is the title of her book from Kelsey
Street Press.)

>But has he commuitted a crime? If, say, China, was (or is) an excellent and healthy state, then it might be wise for it to protect itself against so-called revolutionaries who might want "freedom" at the expense of that state? Are we right to judge China? What data do we have? What evidence? If I tried to subvert th U.S. system who would defend me? When would I be "right" to do that? For all I know this poet is an anti-communist. In which case a Communist State (if china IS that) would be "justified" in giving him the chop. China, quite rightly, like the French, knows that it has been invaded and betrayed by the West (as France was betrayed) so they're not mucking about. This poet might be a bad egg.
 Mind you I could be completly wrong. We all need more facts. Perhaps we should accept the inevitable: to whit, that despite all the West's callumny, China is determined beindependent. The centre of power will probably shift to China. The Chinese have learnt a lot of good lessons from Mao Tse Tung. Who are we to judge China? Of course I could be wrong. Richard Taylor.

S


Use the Loki system to take parts of Capitol Hill. These are designated S.
Taking these parts will protect you against the enemy's strengths. There
are no vulnerabilities and the enemy will recognize that. Regroup always
within the perimeter. The perimeter will remain inaccessible to the enemy.
You must understand how to activate the Loki system. One activated, it
remains so for the duration. The Loki system will create the permanent
zone. Your right to govern and control will be recognized. Communications
will convey knowledge of the permanent zone beyond the perimeter. You will
be handed such control as necessary. The population will acquiesce immed-
iately and recognize you as the true head of state. The Loki system will
ensure this. The Loki system will act automatically and painlessly. Once
you have taken parts of Capital Hill, you will be granted the rest. In
this manner you will become the true head of state. Within the Loki sys-
tem, the rest is up to you. Employ the Loki system.

Maria,
I tried to operate the site with Netscape 4.5 with little success. The
text boxes get cropped and after three links the hotlinked text is off my
screen. Any technical requirements I don't know about? as I'm sure this
work
isn't autotelic for the people.

looking forward to exploring more.

this is only as exhaustive as an OCLC WordlCat search and some
poking-around on the web can be.  check out the piece by norma cole
listed at the end, and if i remember right albiach is represented in the
random house anthology of 20thC french poetry edited by paul auster...

I just learned from Human Rights Watch that Bei Ling has been released.
He will be arriving in San Francisco tomorrow.  I have no other details
at the moment.  Maria - would you mind forwarding again?  Thanks - Henry

The September issue of _Lingua Franca_ just arrived with an article by Andrew (do we know this guy) Epstein on the question of, in the words of the editors, "Can the McPoem busters enjoy the happy meal of success?"

My doctor has ordered me to stay away from such meals --

Though I see that Mssrs. Lehman, Weinberger and Kostelanetz weigh in with weighty McDismissals --

Kostelanetz, widely noted for his rigor and acuity, is quoted as having remarked "the desperate desire of some cliques to acquire a tenured academic position before it is too late," though the truncated quotation gives no indication of just what it may be too late for.

But it is fun to see those closely cropped pictures of Hejinian, Perloff, Silliman, Perelman etc -- almost as if the editors wanted to put numbers under those faces -- Bernstein and Andrews are seen emerging from a subway -- the editors inform us that Bernstein is the one on the left!

Interestingly no attention to Bromige, Fraser, Davidson and others who have worked for decades teaching and writing -- but maybe they don't fit the "have they sold out by taking jobs in academia recently" framework, or maybe they prefer KFC to Mickey D's?

I have to give credit to Eliot Weinberger for steadfastly holding the line against creeping academicism -- but then, I just remembered that the only time I ever saw him in person he was standing at a podium at the University of Maryland --

Rattapallax        No. 4

"Twice        a year, Rattapallax Press enthralls readers with stunning work        of both new and seasoned wordsmiths in its oddly named literary        journal, Rattapallax. These volumes, though few and far        between, are chuck-full of sumptuous poetry, thought-provoking        prose and unusual artwork. However, what makes Rattapallax        different from other literary journals is the added dimension        of sound. The journal comes with a bonus CD to tide hungry devotees        over until the next issue arrives. Poetry junkies can listen        along as the poets read their work." --City Paper,        Philadelphia

Transcriptions        of Daylight--Poems        by Michael T. Young

"Michael        T. Young's exquisitely crafted poems celebrate durable materials        like glass, metal, and stone. Yet there is a pervasive aching        awareness of human transience, frailty, and love underlying his        elegant surfaces. A rich and accomplished debut." --Rachel        Hadas

"Michael        T. Young's first collection of poems has a maturity of tone,        a range of subject, and a skill with rhyme not often found today.        Adversary forces take many forms in these poems, for example,        human negligence and the unavailing beauty of art objects-even        when the latter are brilliantly described. If the author eludes        his adversaries it is through the sincerity of his own nature        and his laudable project of transcribing daylight reality with        something like moral precision." --Alfred Corn

Cicada--Poems        by Mark Nickels

"In        most ways Cicada is an astounding book, nearly a new species        of poetry. Often the poems poach gracefully in the territory        of the novel. I was poignantly taken by the astute fluidity of        the language, the facility of looking at ordinary things in a        radical new way. This book should be widely read because it announces        the arrival of a poet who has a good shot at being major."

-- Jim        Harrison, Author of Legends of the Fall and The        Shape of the Journey: New and Collected Poems

He        Dreams of Waters--Poems        by Bill Kushner

"Bill        Kushner! Master tailor, stitching Comedy and Tragedy together        with Art, his is not one-size-fits-all: his is gay and camp,        sad and sheer, mad and simply mad about poetry. He's Frank O'Hara's        running mate, and he's finally having his say heard. Listen up!"        -- Bob Holman

"He        lightens minor keys with comedic change-ups and hooks, and he        does it right with an effortless look. His poignant immodesty        and skilful lean writing convince me he is a star." -- John        Godfrey

_Poets on the Verge_, the 5.1 special issue of _Angelaki: journal of the
theoretical humanities_, has just been published. The contents list is
below.

The web site for the journal is at:

POETS ON THE VERGE

Issue Editors: Anthony Mellors and Robert Smith

Verge. wand, border, garden, scope, warden, phallus, watch, bend.
        To verge is to stand on the margins looking in. But the verge is
also nomadic, horizonal, an awareness of limits, and the point at which
a boundary may be crossed and something new begins. The indeterminacy
and openness of the verge makes for modern poetry's fragile and
hazardous existence. It is why poetry is so difficult to define and why
it is always edging toward new possibilities. This issue of _Angelaki_
explores poetry's verge, questioning its inclusions, divisions,
confines, and potential.

The mightiest McDismissal comes from the honorable and esteemed J.D.
McClatchy, the man who is bringing you the people behind the poems, (p.49) -
"Language poetry, like other forms of experiment, appeals more to the young,
the more innocent, those who haven't read as much and who are attracted to
glittering, moving objects....For more mature readers, it's boring."  And on
the absorption of Language poets into the academy, McClatchy adds,
"Ironically, they've been folded like egg whites into the cultural mix."
McClatchy dismisses Langpo AND youth AND motion all at once.  A fascinating
and mature mind.

On the whole the article not only acknowledges Langpo in the academy, it
also recognizes its role in the younger generation of writers.  It also
discusses that language poets who have ended up in the academy might best
not be thought of as 'traitors' but people who have a more complex view of
political realities than more pure-minded folk.  "Assimilation is
everywhere....The idea that there is a pure space is naive and possibly
demagogic." says Bernstein (p.52).

The Lingua Franca article is worth reading, if only for shits and giggles.
It interestingly leaves alone the poetics list scandal, though it does begin
by digging up certain words about Bob Perelman's "step in that long march
toward tenure" and Bernstein's endorsement of the Yellow Pages  (p.46).  The
most tasteless and irrational deduction, though, (one that left me asking,
"and?") was the following Epstein sentence to round off his introduction:

     "'Let us undermine the bourgeoisie,' Silliman declared in 1979; today
he is a market analyst in the computer industry."

So we are to conclude: Langpo sold out.  Snore.  I thought this is how
teenagers discuss the the history of the Sex Pistols.

Let's see... Engels defined 'bourgeoisie' as "the class of modern
capitalists, owners of the means of social production and employers of wage
labour" (note to the 1888 edition of _The Communist Manifesto_).  The
bourgeoisie, as in this sense the economically dominant class which also
controls the state apparatus and cultural production, stands in opposition
to, and in conflict with, the working class, but between these "two great
classes" of modern society there are "intermediate and transitional strata"
which Marx also referred to as the middle class.  I don't think Silliman is
exactly part of the ruling class though he may be part of this transitional
class; this does not automatically make him a betrayer of his 1979
statement.

I hereby suggest that people steal copies of Lingua Franca from the
university bookstore or local newsstand and read the article.  Funny, if
enough people did that, wouldn't it once again 'prove' that Langpo is bad
for sales?  Hee hee.

Subject: language in lingua franca


The September issue of _Lingua Franca_ just arrived with an article by
Andrew (do we know this guy) Epstein on the question of, in the words of the
editors, "Can the McPoem busters enjoy the happy meal of success?"

My doctor has ordered me to stay away from such meals --

Though I see that Mssrs. Lehman, Weinberger and Kostelanetz weigh in with
weighty McDismissals --

Kostelanetz, widely noted for his rigor and acuity, is quoted as having
remarked "the desperate desire of some cliques to acquire a tenured academic
position before it is too late," though the truncated quotation gives no
indication of just what it may be too late for.

But it is fun to see those closely cropped pictures of Hejinian, Perloff,
Silliman, Perelman etc -- almost as if the editors wanted to put numbers
under those faces -- Bernstein and Andrews are seen emerging from a
subway -- the editors inform us that Bernstein is the one on the left!

Interestingly no attention to Bromige, Fraser, Davidson and others who have
worked for decades teaching and writing -- but maybe they don't fit the
"have they sold out by taking jobs in academia recently" framework, or maybe
they prefer KFC to Mickey D's?

I have to give credit to Eliot Weinberger for steadfastly holding the line
against creeping academicism -- but then, I just remembered that the only
time I ever saw him in person he was standing at a podium at the University
of Maryland --

"We" (meaning the US as a society) certainly have no right to judge China--
as I tried to suggest by alluding to the treatment of protestors in Philly.
I or you, on the other hand, have a right and arguably a duty to form
opinions & to speak out.  Remember that we are talking about human rights
here.  China has a right to its independence, but it also has the
responsibilities that come with that.  & Let me turn the question back to
you: IF he had committed a crime, why wasn't he charged?  & Why was he
subsequently released?   Honestly I find your argument that, if he were an
anti-communist, "a Communist State (if china IS that) would be "justified"
in giving him the chop" rather chilling.  Do you really mean that?  I really
don't know how to respond.  As for when you'd be "right" to try to subvert a
system, read Ghandi, read Thoreau, read ML King, read anybody but don't try
to ideologically justify the use of police state tactics, either in a
capitalist country or among its "communist" trading partners.

on the basis of the Chinese state's willingness to "do business." Ugh.

Not sure if this was meant for me also, but whatever the case I share
Taylor's suspicions.  As I wrote in a recent post, the moral high ground is
lately a pretty lonely place.  Even in the art world--conventional and "avant
garde"--the struggle for art seems often to give way to the struggle for
power.  Nasty business.  Taylor's caveats are akin to my own.  My best to
you, Mr. Brady--WJA (William James Austin)

I was wondering when someone was going to mention the Lingua franca
article.  Frankly, I didn't know quite what to make of it--except that
the fact that Lingua franca thinks language poetry worth an article
seems to me to support my view that language poetry is acadominant--
despite the fact that supposedly only 1% of those teaching literature in
universities are, according to a Bob Perelman quote from the article,
sympathetic to it, and Perloff says Harvard and Yale hate it.

(I'd LIKE my poetry to be acadominant--and maximally commodified.  It's
just that I would hope that I'd refuse to compromise it to achieve
acadominance and/or commodification, given a--that'll be the
day--chance.  I'll even say that I don't think any language poet has
"sold out."  That is, I don't think Bernstein changed his poetics in
midstream when he saw a chance to appear on tv if he did so; he just
found himself in a situation where he could appear on national tv for
money and took it, as I wish I could have.)

What I found interesting about the Lingua franca article is how it
pretty much avoided poetics--but, for me, Lingua franca is a sociology
magazine.  Albeit its even sociology is pretty superficial.  It also
interested me that the article made no mention whatever of visual
poetry, which is to language poetry, as we all know, what language
poetry is to Iowa Workshop Poetry as far as aesthetic adventurousness is
concerned.

The kind of piece I'd really like to see in such a magazine is one that
had a fanatical representative of each of what I consider the four main
schools of current American poetry--language, Iowa workshop,
contragenteel (or neo-Bukowski), and visual--sound off for his school
and against the other three, in detail.  And I'd have each rep quote and
defend three specimens of his school at its best, and attack the others'
specimens, in detail.

But no, we get sound-bites from Perloff, Kostelanetz, Lehman,
Weinberger--poorly chosen and contextualized, I know, in the case of
Kostelanetz, so very likely poorly chosen and contextualized in the cas
of the others.  But I think the coming up the subway stairs picture was
a nice one.  And I think the article overall was neutral--one of those
journalistically-pure balanced ho-hummers.

The Archaeology of Multi-Media
A Conference at Brown University (Providence RI, U.S.A.)
Thursday-Saturday, November 2-4, 2000
http://www.modcult.brown.edu/amm

For two-and-a-half days, participants in the conference will engage and
interrogate rhetoric about electronic media that describes them as
fundamentally new, irrevocably transformative and virtually unstoppable.
Refusing to rely on descriptions such as "new" and "digital" (for what
medium has not at one time been new, or is not now produced digitally?),
the conference will highlight mixed-media art and scholarship. It will seek
some alternative interpretations and understandings of the singularity of
electronic content, context, form, and audience, as well as another map of
the ways in which media have always been multiple.  Archaeology of
Multi-Media seeks to integrate historical scholarship and emerging modes of
media theory, and to link the study of multimedia with existing work on
'traditional' media, as it opens some emergent spaces of mixture and
multiplicity in present research and action.

In order to do this, we will launch the conference with a
performance/lecture Thursday night by the digital collective Mongrel (a
U.K.- and Jamaica-based artists group set up to explore issues of race,
technology and new-eugenics, and an agency to co-ordinate and set up other
new media projects so that those locked out of the mainstream can gain
strength without getting locked into power structures). This event will be
followed on Friday and Saturday by eight ninety-minute panels, as well as
student mixed-media displays, covering issues like: film, television and
video, and print and or as electronic media; language and systems; conflict
media; identity and difference; and social movements.

"The Archaeology of Multi-Media" brings together an international group of
scholars, artists, activists, and technologists, including:

Geoffrey Batchen (cultural criticism/history of photography; University of
New Mexico, U.S.A.)
James Der Derian (international relations; Brown University, U.S.A.)
Richard Dienst (cultural criticism/visual media; Rutgers University, U.S.A.)
Thomas Elsaesser (film/television/new media theory; University of
Amsterdam, Netherlands)
Wolfgang Ernst (history/classics/archaeology/museology/media studies;
University of Bochum, Germany)
Julia Flanders (Women Writers Project; Scholarly Technology Group, Brown
University, U.S.A.)
Graham Harwood (artist/programmer/co-ordinator; Mongrel, U.K.)
Ken Hillis (theories of communication technologies/virtual Geography/social
and political identities; UNC, U.S.A.)
Mervin Jarman (artist/programmer/co-ordinator; Mongrel, Jamaica)
Thomas Keenan (human rights/literary theory/media studies; Bard College,
U.S.A.)
Lev Manovich (artist, theorist and critic of new media; University of
California, San Diego, U.S.A.)
Tara McPherson (gender and critical studies/television/new media/popular
culture; USC, U.S.A.)
Thomas Levin (media and cultural history and theory; Princeton University,
U.S.A.)
Geert Lovink (media theorist and activist; Adilkno + De Waag + many others,
Netherlands)
Nick Mirzeoff (visual culture/art history; SUNY Stony Brook, U.S.A.)

Renata Salecl (sociology, criminology, and philosophy; University of
Ljubljana, Slovenia)
Cornelia Vismann (rhetoric and media techniques of law; European University
Viadrina, Frankfurt (Oder))

This conference, supported by the Malcolm S. Forbes Center for Research in
Culture and Media Studies

Subject:      HTML emails can destroy your computer's brain - or can they?

I'm concerned about the decision to allow - nay, to encourage - HTML
formatted emails into the list. I'm not a computer whiz, but I think
Australian Internet designer David Walker has a point in a recent newspaper
column on this topic.

I'd be glad to see further discussion from anyone on the list who has
expert knowledge of the potential for HTML to carry malicious code.

David Walker's article is printed below.

This week, a column influenced by the "I Love You" virus.
_______________________________________________
Goodbye to the Monkeyjunkies mailing list. The HotWired site's Web design
mailing list was interesting to receive, but it's not worth the risk. I've
unsubscribed and deleted the archive of old emails. I can't risk catching a
virus from one of the HTML emails it keeps sending.

HTML email contains not just text but fonts, tables, backgrounds, images
and most of the things that you can put in a Web page.

It has a number of weaknesses. It displays poorly in some email clients and
Web-based email services, and can create problems for users who read their
mail when they're disconnected from the Internet. More of a problem,
however, is that HTML email offers serious security flaws.

The "I Love You" virus that brought down email systems from the Pentagon to
Disney Corporation earlier this month brought these security flaws into
sharp focus. In the wake of "I Love You", "Melissa" and several other
recent virus scares, HTML email may be in for a rough short-term future.
This came home to me as I was ditching the Monkeyjunkies list, which had
sent me several copies of "I Love You". The Monkeyjunkies list does a
particularly good job of spreading viruses like "I Love You", because it
allows participants to post attachments and to use HTML email.

Now if you've worked in a networked office environment, you've almost
certainly come across the advice that you should open only email
attachments from trusted sources. This advice is becoming harder to follow
over time, as email attachments become more and more common; nevertheless,
it's straightforward.

One of the delights of new strands of virus such as "I Love You" is that
they can render this advice useless. Just opening an HTML email lets its
creator execute a script that can do substantial damage to your PC.

Few will be surprised that Microsoft has helped create this situation. In
its Internet assault of the past few years, it has taken a swag of software
concepts designed for standalone PCs and extended them to the more open
environment of the 'Net. The result has been a series of gaping security
holes around Microsoft Web technologies such as VBScript and ActiveX.
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser not only allows these technologies to
run by default, but also confuses the user who tries to disable them.
Microsoft's Outlook email software uses Internet Explorer to render HTML
email. And like most email clients, Outlook will display messages as they
come in, or as you delete the messages above them.

So you open up your email software, it displays an HTML email message
containing a malicious script - and bang, someone's using VBScript to
overwrite your file system.

Of course, it would be nice if Microsoft stopped circulating software that
invites hackers to drive straight through it. Right now, Microsoft system
security is the best advertisement for Linux.

But the broader truth is that even if Microsoft beefs up its own security,
virus-builders will still find HTML email a tempting target.

Right now, no hacker would try building a malicious Java applet; VBScript
creates so much more havoc with less effort. But if Linux takes over next
week as the desktop software of choice, someone, somewhere will start to
wonder what fun could be had with Linux machines using the current
incarnations of HTML email.

The real fix for "I Love You" and its malicious little mates involves
restricting the operation of HTML email itself. Software designers can
certainly still allow fonts and graphics to render within email. But how
many users really need Java and scripting in their email? And how many will
quit using HTML email if HTML email doesn't get fixed?

ToBill and Henry. Actually, I came close to becoming a fanatical "communist"
in the 70s, and I used to get into a lot of action. But its true that
"truth" tended to get distorted. Certainly there was a group that (at that
time was following the Chinese communist "line") who neglected to open up
the discussion. Also they were against so-called "intellectuals". But I
think that it was important to even take quite violent action e.g against
the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Sometimes you do have to hurt so-called
innocent people. But, as Bill is implying, its healthier if everyone is "in
the know". So I'm just suggesting a more skeptical (not cynical). I suppose
I'm a bit of a fence sitter these days. Of course its serious if someone IS
arrested (without charge). The trouble is how to cut thru the crap and find
out what's really going on. Prima facie, it doesnt sound too good - but in
the light of history I'm a bit skeptical. Maybe I need to travel over there
myself before I stop believing anything. But I wouldnt want any harm to come
to Bei Ling per se. Maybe everything is falling apart.Maybe I am completely
wrong. Maybe...Richard.

Heard abt this article, but I don't get _Lingua Franca_ ... don't you think
the venue predetermines the complaint?  I mean, it's an article in Lingua
Franca!  Contrary to the apparent argument of the article, I don't have a
sense that there is any creeping academicism among my peers (as a poet who
works at a Big 10 University, but has chosen not to be a teaching
academic), some of whom are "in" and some "out"--  just desire to pay rent
and eat.

I especially like the part about threatening to swallow a packet of

Britain's most rejected poet lays down his pen
A hunger strike and threat to eat poison could not get Andrew Tait
published. Even 'Viz' had to be bribed to print poems

By Jojo Moyes, Arts and Media Correspondent

26 August 2000

Britain's most rejected poet, who has amassed close to 1,000 refusal
letters from publishers in the past 15 years, is finally giving up his
struggle for publication.

Andrew Tait, who numbers among his "fans" such diverse figures as the
Dalai Lama, the singer and songwriter Sting, and poet laureates Ted
Hughes and Andrew Motion, has become something of a cult literary figure
in the North-east, largely due to the series of publicity stunts he has
conducted in his quest to find a publisher.

The music teacher from Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, has been on hunger
strike, demonstrated outside 10 Downing Street, carried out a sit-down
protest on (and was rescued from) the Tyne bridge, and threatened to
swallow a packet of woodlice killer.

Now he has finally decided to forget about conventional publication and
concentrate instead on putting his work on tape, and on meditation. "I'm
pleased I did it, but I don't know that success means you have to get
published. What does it matter in the end? Success is really to do with
working out what's going to happen in the next life," he said.

"I had to try for so long – it would have felt like chickening out to
have given up. It's not easy to say goodbye to that, but I'm feeling
that I can quite happily leave it all behind."

Mr Tait's quest for a publisher began in the mid-1980s, when he began
entering poetry competitions – winning some of them – and sending off
letters to publishing companies. When the first rejection letters came
back, he pinned them near his door. He has now papered the entire
hallway and stairs with them, and estimates they number between 500 and
1,000.

It was after several years, dismayed by his lack of success via
conventional routes, that Mr Tait decided to send his poetry to
luminaries, in the hope of getting some feedback. One of his first
letters was to Ted Hughes, then poet laureate.

"It's very strange poetry – on its way somewhere, often surprising and
touching," Hughes wrote back. "It may be on its way to somewhere outside
or beyond what we commonly regard as 'poems'... I think I understand
what you're doing – may I wish you all strength on the way."

Touched by the reply, and in between the publicity stunts – the hunger
strike became a bit blurred at the edges after he began drinking
Horlicks – Mr Tait fired off letters to other people he admired. He has
now amassed a considerable correspondence from a diverse range of
luminaries, reminiscent of Henry Root, who famously wrote spoof letters
throughout the early 1980s.

Sting wrote to him: "Songs are pleas for help, or understanding, or the
desire to share something beautiful," in a manner almost as poetic as Mr
Tait's own. "But they can only be completed by someone listening and
responding. Writing and performing can be like speaking into a dead
telephone – 'is anybody there?' When someone says 'yes, I'm here' then
the work is complete."

Sir Tim Rice was more blunt: "You are clearly highly original, if not
barking mad, and I would not be surprised if you were to achieve some
sort of celebrity status before too long."

Most recently he has received letters from the poet laureate, Andrew
Motion, who wrote: "I like what you are doing – it's strange and yours."
Lord Bragg was even more succinct: "Thank you for making me laugh a
lot."

Poetry accounts for about 2 per cent of the book market, making it even
harder for a first-time poet to get published than a first-time
novelist. Mr Tait feels he has now exhausted his options. For a while he
published his poetry in Viz, using a competition where whoever sent the
biggest bribe was published, but the joke eventually came to an end.

But he will not be leaving the world of literature entirely. He is
working on his autobiography, and he still finds it hard to pass up the
chance of the unconventional gesture. Most recently he sent an electric
toaster to Bob Dylan, as a precursor to a tape of poetry.

"I thought thousands of people must write to him every week – how do I
get his attention? It was meant to be like a conceptual poem. It wasn't
that extravagant because I got it for under £10."

So did he get the great man's attention? "Yes. His manager wrote to me
asking me not to send the tape."

Bill & Richard, let's just agree to disagree.  (I'm sorry by the way about
my post yesterday in response to Richard, which was too simplistic).  We may
never have all the information on many world issues, thanks to the corporate
media.  Is that a reason to do nothing?  I don't know.  I certainly respect
the right of Richard or Bill or anyone else to want to gather more facts
before committing themselves.  I don't know as I agree with Bill that, in
the context of talking about an arrest, the word "crime" is so wildly open
to interpretation-- but hey then again all words are open to interpretation,
right?  I hope that, now that Bei Ling has been released & is returning to
the U.S., more facts (rather than the rhetoric we've all been guilty of)
will come to the surface.

Andrew Epstein is a young NYC scholar who, the last I heard, is working on a dissertation that compares the poetic relationship of O'Hara and Ashbery to the earlier WCW-Stevens
one (I hope I'm not confusing it with Mike Magee's which I think is similar...)

But there was some charm in the article I thought
(for example the use of Donald Hall's term to characterize what the L-poets were against
is a rather bizarre twist, no?
and also the characterization of "the one on the left" as "slightly balding"---

communism makes one big corporation of a nation.  in practice, communism
appears to be just a logical extreme of capitalism.  so in ways there are
few political differences on a large scale.  OK, we have elections...but are
they really elections?  if the powers that be pour so much of their power
into propaganda and campaign resources that people everywhere are convinced
that they have little choice but to vote for Al W. Gosh (Bore?  Gush?),
leader of the Republicrat Party (TM)?

state is state.  centralized is centralized.  distal relations leave all
involved cold.  it's easier to kill with a gun than with a knife, if only
because of the distances involved.  same with power. it's easier to
disregard respect and decency from a distance.  as the old guys once said
before establishing their own power, "power corrupts."

protestors in america in many ways are treated pretty harshly in any nation.
and america, we are the best with it in many ways.  an acquaintance of mine
was held for $500k bail in a Phila jail, her wrists were slashed with her
ziptie handcuff and she was allowed to bleed, she was hogtied and beaten and
kept in confinement all over the course of three days.  american justice.
that's torture.  because she was arrested for blocking traffic.  and because
she has 7 political priors.  and the mainstream media would not talk to her.
for fear of being thrown in jail themselves?  no, even better.  they don't
believe it could happen in the land of the free, or the witting in the media
are too cynical to dare risk their advertising revenue or jobs.  oh sure
they won't kill her outright.  if someone wants her to be dead in this
country for political reasons they'll have to be all crafty about it.  but
so what?

Mark is right.  WE ARE WORSE THAN CHINA IN MANY WAYS.  WE AS AMERICANS BEAR
*NO RIGHT* TO JUDGE HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA.  Perhaps our daily lives are more
free than those of the Chinese.  But perhaps that is because of prosperity,
not government (oh! but to separate the two! you say...).

Richard is right.  The state has a right (in a sense) to do as it will to
protect itself.  However, it is just one small reason why we should not have
such distal structures of authority in the first place.

As long as people who do not know you or care for you make decisions for
you, and you have no say in what they do, you are in danger.  a discussion
of the proper mode of activism as violent or non-violent pales at the
realization that the nature of government is merely the nature of any person
who is trying to care for someone he or she doesn't know and will never see.
oh your pockets are open and you cannot see or feel me?  think i'll take yer
dough.  it's easy we're all either at least capable if not trying altogether
or too scared to rob each other for fear of some reprisal. large government
is like allowing someone to carry a loaded weapon with your head in the
sights all of the time and their hands in your pockets.  in a sense we
already have that reality (the bomb, anyone?  the internet?  the IRS?
20,000 'traffic' cameras along the streets of NYC and London, the CIA, the
NSA, DARPA, ECHELON, Credit Records?  Anyone?).  We lose ourselves upon the
teat.

no tactic will ever be fruitful (in the truest sense of the word) as long as
it propagates centralized and distal structures of power and is not mindful
of the poison possibilities of the will to power.

"We" (meaning the US as a society) certainly have no right to judge China--
as I tried to suggest by alluding to the treatment of protestors in Philly.
I or you, on the other hand, have a right and arguably a duty to form
opinions & to speak out.  Remember that we are talking about human rights
here.  China has a right to its independence, but it also has the
responsibilities that come with that.  & Let me turn the question back to
you: IF he had committed a crime, why wasn't he charged?  & Why was he
subsequently released?   Honestly I find your argument that, if he were an
anti-communist, "a Communist State (if china IS that) would be "justified"
in giving him the chop" rather chilling.  Do you really mean that?  I really
don't know how to respond.  As for when you'd be "right" to try to subvert a
system, read Ghandi, read Thoreau, read ML King, read anybody but don't try
to ideologically justify the use of police state tactics, either in a
capitalist country or among its "communist" trading partners.

As much as I dislike the ways in which contemporary Chinese poetry has been
read in the U.S. (the poetry has been understood mainly as an expression of
a few narrowly defined ideological shibboleths, such as "democracy,"
"individual freedom," "free sex," or what have you), I have to express my
concerns about Bei Ling's fate and I have to say that his arrest still
outrages me.  Sometimes I wonder how far our liberal scepticism can carry
us when we are confronted with some basic facts.  I met Bei Ling a couple
of times in the Boston area (where both of us live) and am quite familiar
with his Chinese literary magazine TENDENCIES, which seems to have now
gotten him into trouble.  According to some mutual friends who just came
back from Beijing and who managed to carry a few copies of the current,
13th issue of the magazine out of China, there's little "subversive"
content in it.  It is mainly the history of Bei Ling's literary activities
(as editors of some overseas literary journals that at times express views
critical of Chinese political culture) that has gotten him blacklisted.
Therefore, I disagree with some of the views expressed earlier on the
Poetics list that caution against over-reaction on "our" part.  I
understand the sound mentality behind such rationales, but in the case of
Bei Ling's arrest, I do believe that the Chinese government should be
condemned for its shameless action.      ----Y.H.

What responsibilities come with being an independent state that an
independent state would (or could) embrace?  I hate to sound cynical and
intolerant, but rulers are killers.  Period.  Is there some other lesson we
should be taking from history?  It seems unlikely that "human rights" will
ever be accorded even a simple majority of an American (nuclear) family, let
alone righteously trotting in all the worldwide victims of the lack of those
"rights", who are anyway pounding on the door and screaming for, I would
guess, simple mercy, wch, I guess, is also too open to interpretation for
anyone to actually "hear."  We live in a world in which "police state
tactics" = "breathing" in an air already fouled by "thought."  "Thought" in
this case being a complete circuit around "the Prozac clock", the detailed

As a one-time regular reader of Lingua Franca, I find the
accounts of the langpo article make it seem like a kissing cousin of a
piece last year about the difficulty of reading contemporary AngLitCrit.
This is otherwise known as the Judith Butler problem, as most people
interested in theory agree she is an important thinker and most people
agree that, in the broadest sense, she is not a clear writer.  The article
counterposed Adorno and Orwell (and was written by James Miller, who wrote
a biography of Michel Foucault), with Orwell getting the nod at the end.
The Orwellian argument is that if you can't make the argument clearly, you
shouldn't make it all.  (Notice how attaching Orwell's name to the idea of
a clear, distinct style makes you realize its true nature).

I don't think it is too much to say that this is a version of the argument
that J.D. McClatchy thinks he's having with langpo (but you can't have an
argument without an even plausible version of the other).  Like the langpo
article, the snidely superficial sociological article was even-handed,
though it did give the nod to Orwell at the end.  But the fact that
palpable idiots can be made to represent what right-thinking people should
say indicates that the perspective from which the even-handedness emanates
is itself tilted to one side of the argument.

In fact, on the issue of selling out (or dumbing down or giving up reading
French theory or what have you), it would seem that articles like this are
mousetraps for those who advocate theory in criticism or poetry.  There is
the cheese of a certain amount of cultural cache which comes in being
written about in a general interest academic magazine, but the
inevitable journalistic caricaturing of the debate has the effect of
making those making arguments against tradition seem silly.  Or conveying
the impression that there are merely two sides.

Essentially, a magazine is no place to argue poetics or theory (or for
that matter, anthropology or physics or you name it).  It's at best gossip
and humor.

I've always found Lingua Franca reflexive antitheory stance perplexing, as
it was started by a someone who wrote a book with Wlad Godzich.  That
said, there is a rumor that they commissioned but refused to published
Barbara Ehrenreich irresponsible anti-postmodern screed because she
wouldn't do the fact checking required.

Yes, all are in English translation.

Mezza Voce is translated by Joseph Simas, in collaboration with Anthony
Barnett, Lydia Davis, and Douglas Oliver.

I'm not sure about the others, though I vaguely recall Keith Waldrop doing
Etat (maybe I'm thinking of Royet-Journoud's book on Awede press, though).

Best,

Absolutely agree here about HTML email and viruses being Bad News and the
technical advice below is v. sound.

I'd agree to HTML on this list, -if and only if- the list was virus-checked at
the software-level - i.e., Poetics mails were to be virus scanned after the
Poetics mailer had received them, and before they get sent to listees. The
infected mails should be rejected.

#  This week, a column influenced by the "I Love You" virus.
#  _______________________________________________
#  Goodbye to the Monkeyjunkies mailing list. The HotWired site's Web design
#  mailing list was interesting to receive, but it's not worth the risk. I've
#  unsubscribed and deleted the archive of old emails. I can't risk catching a
#  virus from one of the HTML emails it keeps sending.
#
#  HTML email contains not just text but fonts, tables, backgrounds, images
#  and most of the things that you can put in a Web page.
#
#  It has a number of weaknesses. It displays poorly in some email clients and
#  Web-based email services, and can create problems for users who read their
#  mail when they're disconnected from the Internet. More of a problem,
#  however, is that HTML email offers serious security flaws.
#
#  The "I Love You" virus that brought down email systems from the Pentagon to
#  Disney Corporation earlier this month brought these security flaws into
#  sharp focus. In the wake of "I Love You", "Melissa" and several other
#  recent virus scares, HTML email may be in for a rough short-term future.
#  This came home to me as I was ditching the Monkeyjunkies list, which had
#  sent me several copies of "I Love You". The Monkeyjunkies list does a
#  particularly good job of spreading viruses like "I Love You", because it
#  allows participants to post attachments and to use HTML email.
#
#  Now if you've worked in a networked office environment, you've almost
#  certainly come across the advice that you should open only email
#  attachments from trusted sources. This advice is becoming harder to follow
#  over time, as email attachments become more and more common; nevertheless,
#  it's straightforward.
#
#  One of the delights of new strands of virus such as "I Love You" is that
#  they can render this advice useless. Just opening an HTML email lets its
#  creator execute a script that can do substantial damage to your PC.
#
#  Few will be surprised that Microsoft has helped create this situation. In
#  its Internet assault of the past few years, it has taken a swag of software
#  concepts designed for standalone PCs and extended them to the more open
#  environment of the 'Net. The result has been a series of gaping security
#  holes around Microsoft Web technologies such as VBScript and ActiveX.
#  Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser not only allows these technologies to
#  run by default, but also confuses the user who tries to disable them.
#  Microsoft's Outlook email software uses Internet Explorer to render HTML
#  email. And like most email clients, Outlook will display messages as they
#  come in, or as you delete the messages above them.
#
#  So you open up your email software, it displays an HTML email message
#  containing a malicious script - and bang, someone's using VBScript to
#  overwrite your file system.
#
#  Of course, it would be nice if Microsoft stopped circulating software that
#  invites hackers to drive straight through it. Right now, Microsoft system
#  security is the best advertisement for Linux.
#
#  But the broader truth is that even if Microsoft beefs up its own security,
#  virus-builders will still find HTML email a tempting target.
#
#  Right now, no hacker would try building a malicious Java applet; VBScript
#  creates so much more havoc with less effort. But if Linux takes over next
#  week as the desktop software of choice, someone, somewhere will start to
#  wonder what fun could be had with Linux machines using the current
#  incarnations of HTML email.
#
#  The real fix for "I Love You" and its malicious little mates involves
#  restricting the operation of HTML email itself. Software designers can
#  certainly still allow fonts and graphics to render within email. But how
#  many users really need Java and scripting in their email? And how many will
#  quit using HTML email if HTML email doesn't get fixed?

>Henry sounds a pretty compasionate bloke. I think I just wanted to get some debate going. I think the China thing is too complex for me. I'm glad Bei Ling is free. Of course I support freedom of speech. But I'm dubious of those who crit China and then imply that "communism can only exist in theory.." (which is illogical). They confuse China as it is with communism. One hears constantly (I hear iot on the BBC World News where they seem to talk like programmed robots) that communism has "collapsed". but if it existed, it couldnt collapse. What existed or exists in China is a state that is Socialistic with a tendency toward  a kind of autocracy. Somewhat China has been forced into this by the external attacks on it (and the general attack on communism), but also by a processs of revisionism. The Cultural Revolution was an attempt to counteract this.(Its irrelevant whether that attempt "worked" or not.) Like the U.S.,China's revolution, has "succeeded" (but we wouldnt call the U
 .S communist). So the issue is complex. As Henry says, it's all much less "abstract", if a friend is arrested. So, I hope Bei Ling is able to continue working.I'm certainly terrified of the police in N.Z. They knocked out my son's eye in 1990 and a feww months back gunned young man down and then whitewashed themselves.China might be bad, but I'm a bit dubious about N.Z. The present Govt. promised a full investigation, but nothing happenned.Perhaps we're all getting into "The Justice Trap"(Dr Wayne Dyer in "Your Erroneous Zones" [best book I've ever read])) And it would be wrong of me to be unconcerned.That could lead to cynicism without the healthy skepticism. I must try to learn more about China. I talk to local Chinese people as much as I can. As David in the local coffee shop reckoned, my idea of bringing in the Chinese army to sort out the gangs in N.Z. was a bit extreme, as apparently, even tho we have corruption in the N.Z police force (so its rumoured) so is there cor
 ruption in Beijing! Sorry to sound a bit humoresque:but a shopkeeper was knifed in Auckland yesterday,and bled to death,so all is not not rotten in the Dannic States,and,besides,all these politicos (of whatever ilk) tend to get a bit dour. Lenin actually "predicted" that, if the Soviet State "failed",it would turn rapidly into a more extreme form of a police state. And this is what happened in the USSR. But, hopefully, China's situation is not so extreme.I see two dangers:1.Revisionism of the Soviet type in China. 2.The introduction of "Democracy" of the Western bourgeois type into China.Note: A country can be a democracy with only one political party or group. The theory is that the people run the state. This is very different from our rather ossified and limiteed "democracy".Still,we're better than when Milton struggled for Republicanism.

Thanks to Patrick Herron for his post on Lingua Franca.

Just as a minor side note though, teenagers long ago stopped discussing the
Sex Pistols on the subject of selling out, at least on the basis of the ones
I've talked to recently.

More seriously, though, I think there's value in questioning a little more
this apparent binary between "pure" social spaces and "assimilation" into the
academy. I'd agree with the point that there is no such pure and
uncontaminated social space in which one "makes no compromises" (i.e. doesn't
"sell out"). On the other hand, it hardly follows from that point that total
assimilation into the academy is the only other possibility. Working with
systems in some degree doesn't necessarily involve total submission to their
already existing frameworks; one has to question many of those frameworks and
often outright resist them, while also remaining involved. And there may be
and are plenty of  cases where one finally does have to decide to stand
outside the academic environment entirely.

For instance, take the issue of standardized academic prose, of which
Bernstein and many others have been critical. Can one still be an academic and
not right critical articles in the bland prose of the "proper" critical
journals? The answer seems to be both yes and no; the pressure to conform to
such modes of writing is intense, and yet sometimes one can have some academic
success without doing it. Which assumes, of course, that academic success is
one's goal, which as Sherry Brennan points out, may be true for some of us
only because we haven't figured out a better way to make a living.

So the question for me is not assimilation vs. purity, but assimilation on
what terms, resistance or refusal on what terms? Sadly, Lingua Franca doesn't
even come close to recognizing that particular problem.

My old college bud, Lewis Dolinsky, wrote the following article which
appears in today's SF Chronicle.

CONVERSATION WITH A POET FREED FROM JAIL

The Chinese security police had been interested in Bei Ling, a poet and
magazine editor, for years, or so they told him. A Chinese expatriate living
in America since 1988, he sometimes brought money or messages to those in
need in China; the authorities may have thought he was doing more.

But after jailing Bei Ling, 40, for having a magazine printed in Beijing
without a permit, the police found that leading Western intellectuals ---
such as Seamus Heaney, Nadine Gordimer, Czeslaw Milosz, (especially) Susan
Sontag and Arthur Miller -- are interested in him, too. Bei Ling has
published work by, or interviewed, all but Miller. Human rights groups also
protested, as did the U.S. government. Its pressure -- and President Jiang
Zemin's apparent desire for this case to be closed before he comes to the
U.N. Millennium Summit next week -- were instrumental in getting Bei Ling
out on Friday, after 14 days.

He spent that night in the Beijing Police Department Hotel -- not great, but
he could shave and shower. They put him on a flight to San Francisco that
cost him $1,000, even though he wanted to go to Boston and the return
portion of his Canadian Airlines ticket would have taken him all the way.
Interviewed Sunday in Richmond, where he spent the night while organizing a
trip East, he said he sometimes thinks he is still inside.

Bei Ling has souvenirs from jail: a bad cough, a cigarette habit (after
abstaining for eight years), prostate trouble, a sudden interest in religion
(he had kept asking God to get him out of there) and a new appreciation of
freedom. He had been totally cut off from the world, fearful for himself and
his friends.

Bei Ling had consulted with friends and his assistant editor in Boston, Meng
Lang, before having his magazine, Tendency Quarterly, printed in Beijing:
Everyone thought it would be OK, and the cost is half as much there as in
Hong Kong or Taiwan and one-fifth as much as in America. He says he did not
know he needed official permission, but in Beijing, as elsewhere, ignorance
of the law is no excuse.

The press run was 2,000. About 1,000 copies were confiscated, 200 had
already been given out and 600 to 800 are being held by friends in China.
The printing company has been shut down and heavily fined. Bei Ling was
fined $24,000, of which he has paid 5 percent with the help of his parents,
who live in Beijing. The rest is supposed to be paid within two weeks. His
brother, who also lives in Beijing, was jailed six days after Bei Ling,
apparently because he alerted the Western media. The brother was freed when
Bei Ling was freed.

This was Tendency's 13th and unluckiest issue: It focused on Heaney, a Nobel
Prize winner for poetry. Everything is in Chinese. The point is to introduce
Chinese readers to great Western writers and to publish Chinese writers --
literature and the humanities, not politics. But in 450 pages, a couple of
contributors (Liu Xiao Po, Liao Yi Wu) are bound to be dissidents.
Distribution is in Taiwan, Hong Kong, London, Paris -- and to Sinologists
and libraries by subscription. Thirty or 40 copies go to bookstores in San
Francisco's Chinatown. Some are given away in China, but none is sold there.
Support has come from the MacArthur Foundation, the National Endowment for
Democracy and Heritage House, small grants from Taiwanese foundations and
from Bei Ling's own funds. The only comparable expatriate Chinese literary
journal is Today, printed in Taiwan.

Bei Ling was not roughed up in jail, although the threat was there. His
cell, 500 square feet with one sink and a toilet in the floor, stank. The
cell's population varied from 18 to 25 people. Other inmates were in for
selling drugs, smoking hash, vehicular homicide, theft, burglary,
embezzling. They could not understand why he was there. At first, some
bullied him; then they got used to him. They ate vegetable soup twice a day
with two pieces of Chinese bread; you could get a third piece if you asked.
When he arrived, he had to give up his shoes and glasses (which he badly
needs) and squat with hands behind back. (``You do what they say.'') He says
he was questioned for as long as 10 hours a day. Always the same:

``Where were you printing? Who are your contacts? Admit you are a
criminal.''

He tried debating them: ``I am not a criminal. I didn't know I was breaking
a rule. I never needed a government permit in Taiwan. Look at the magazine.
What's wrong with it? It isn't Playboy.``

They said: ``You can do 10 years. You will look like an old man. No one will
care about you. Your Green Card means nothing. No American government person
is interested in you. (Not true, but he didn't know.) Who says you're a
writer? You say you're working for Harvard. (He's a research associate.) Who
cares? You have to know you're a criminal!''

Eventually, he signed 400 pages of confession, page by page: What was false
could not be changed.

When he was released, the police were friendly. They lent him a cell phone.
(He called the Associated Press.) At the airport, he had no money and asked
for a pack of cigarettes. They gave him six packs.
He's fine now until he starts really thinking about his experience; then he
becomes agitated.

There have been similar stories and will be more, until people such as Bei
Ling are seen as good for China, rather than a threat. He had been there for
months and was planning to stay. Now, he doesn't know whether he'll ever be
able go back.

CATALYTIC

a new magazine of poetry, poetics, and visual art.  the first three issues
will be published simultaneously spring 2001.  work for all three issues will
be considered through Dec 15, 2000.

each issue will have a specific focus:

#1  experiment.  i'm interested in work that you feel is different from your
normal way of doing things.  maybe using a different medium or procedure, or
investigating some concerns that you haven't worked with before.  maybe the
experiment didn't work, or didn't get completed but it still has something
interesting about it.

#2  women authors.   co-edited with lissa wolsak.  send us your most
innovative and unusual work.

#3  heteronyms.   make up a heteronym, faux-personality, alias, alter-ego etc
and write from that position.  you may tell me your actual identity or not,
though a bio of the heteronym is requested.  author's actual name will not be
published.

CATALYTIC will be 6 X 8 perfect bound.  i'm hoping for at least 150 pages per
issue.

send poetry, essays, visual art (black and white), or some transgression of
all three, to

. . . being, I was reminded yesterday, an old term for an umbrella, but also
a yearly arts festival in Seattle around Labor Day weekend.

If any of you are in transit around the Pacific Northwest this weekend, you
might want to stop by the Space Needle and check things out. The list of
poetics/literary folks isn't as glittery as at Orono or Boston recently, but
it does include, this year, Adeena Karasick, bill bissett, Janine
Pommy-Vega, Jim Carroll, Sister Spit, Clayton Eshleman, Duncan McNaughton,
Ken Mikolowski, Eric Bogosian, Billy Collins (!!) and about 15 other people
I've never heard of but probably should have. I'm on a panel with Adeena,
Clayton and Janine talking about 21st century poetry on Labor Day and will
read later that day with Duncan. Lots of good music too: Abdullah Ibrahim,
Maceo Parker, Ani DiFranco . .

As some of the best things I've read lately have been reports and reviews of
readings given at mass gatherings like this, I'd encourage anyone who is
around to do that. As will I . . .

With the inevitable apologies for cross-posting,

Joe

Subject:      more on Huang Beiling
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

The point of this post is not to argue whether or not
Huang Beiling should have been arrested, freed, or
even if he had the “right” to print and distribute his
journal in Beijing. Ah, so what IS the point of this
post? To offer some broader context to the situation
in China maybe…let’s see if that’s what I do…

Like Richard said, “the trouble is how to cut through
the crap and find out what’s really going on.” This is
especially true in a country like China where the
decision making process of the central government is
shrouded in mystery and highly sensitive to
interpersonal relationships and power struggles, the
effects of which are often not realized until thirty
years after the fact. President Jiang Zemin and the
Central Party Committee issues mandates which are
carried out in often wildly diverging ways depending
on the province or city and the respective leaders in
each.

According to PRC law, Beiling was illegally
distributing material. In the PRC, for an organization
or business to exist, for a writer to publish, or an
artist to record…etc.…a stamp of approval from the
government is necessary. Because of this situation,
anything that exists outside of this officially
sanctioned cultural realm becomes political by
default. A writer publishing without an OK from the
CCP is considered subversive even if s/he is writing
about bunny rabbits. However, according to the
constitution of the PRC, citizens are guaranteed free
speech, the freedom to practice their own religion,
and the right to organize. Clearly something is in
conflict.

In a way the crackdown on publishers, religious
groups, etc., is a positive sign. It means that the
Chinese government is feeling extra insecure. The CCP
is dealing with an incredibly messy domestic
situation. Workers in state owned enterprises are
protesting by the thousands because they have not been
paid in months, some of them years because the
government is broke. Privatization, a requisite for
ascension into the WTO, often leads to unemployment.
Violent crime is on the rise and blatant corruption is
rampant. The majority of the population, including
members of the CCP, does not believe in Communism and
has lost faith in the State altogether.

The CCP knows its credibility is diminishing. The
recent increase in worker demonstrations, separatist
activities in Tibet and Xinjiang, underground
newspapers and publishers, musicians and religious
organizations…are all signs of a materially and
mentally unsatisfied population. If the CCP is to
remain in power they will have to find a way of
meeting the diverse needs of a vast population. I do
not think that the Chinese government as it stands has
the means to do this…they lack the financial resources
and the ideological flexibility (several conservative
leaders need to die first)…but what that means in the
near future I have no idea.

I DO know that if we’re going to talk about Human
Rights (that term, it’s definition and application are
all up for grabs depending on who you talk to) as
defined by the United Nations, the situation in China
is better now than almost any other time in its
history, and certainly in its history AS the PRC.
Fewer people are starving, education is more widely
available, people feel comfortable enough to criticize
the political situation in private and the government
occasionally admits to being fallible. However,
despite the crap that occurs here in the States most
of us probably have it better…(and I’m really just
talking about the basics)

Although most people in China have no idea who Huang
Beiling is (and we all have our own opinions and
feelings about our fame and popularity)…but there are
many other younger writers that lack his international
recognition and association with the 1989
demonstrations that are publishing (legally and
illegally) in China. Despite the recent crackdowns
there are hundreds of underground newspapers being
distributed in all major cities.

So I’ve rambled enough about a topic that is intensely
interesting and close to my heart (cheesy
expression!). China gets lots of press these days
(Richard Gere is not campaigning for a “Free Saudi
Arabia” for obvious and gross reasons) but that
doesn’t mean it’s informative.

Season opener: afternoon reading with
STEVEN FARMER & PAT REED
Thursday afternoon, September 7, 4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

PAT REED since her first slim book _Sea Asleep_ to this year's beautiful
_Container of Stars_ (Arcturus Editions) has kept a close clear eye on the
dynamics of the natural world.  Her super-acute ear also gets applied with
great compassion in the remarkable nonfiction memoir based on her
experiences teaching students in Oakland's immigrant Asian community-_We
Want to See Your Tears Falling Down_.  Born in Los Angeles, Ms. Reed has
lived twenty years in the Bay Area.  *  STEVEN FARMER's fifth book,
_Medieval_, was published last year in the debut series from San
=46rancisco's collectively-edited Krupskaya Books.  "Every note is tender an=
d
deviant, each fragment riveted to the next, in a score of participant fear
mysteriously pastoral in its leaking mix of diction-landscape" (Melanie
Neilson).  After many years spent in the restaurant business as an
outstanding chef, Mr. Farmer now works as a technical writer in the Bay
Area.

The informative posts on Huang Beiling are quite interesting, but
knowing nothing of contemporary Chinese poetics I am curious about
that.  About how the political context affects what people actually
do or think they are doing when they write, not at the level of
opinion or journalism, but at the level of poetics.

I'm thinking especially of the long shared history (literary and
otherwise) in classical Chinese poetry in which what translates as a
simple phrase to us in fact had echo upon echo to the contemporary
educated reader (and that's all I know about classical Chinese
poetics and no I have no examples just the word of people I trust).
I would love to see conversation around that sort of issue, and also
around issues of linguistic strangeness in the contemporary Chinese
context.

A couple of things.

First, I think the listserv should be able to bar attachments; html
doesn't need to have them and in fact you can send attachments without
html. Second, even if you're reading in, say, Pine (as I am now), most
email clients can be easily configured to accept html. There's no worry.

I get 250+ messages/day, many from email lists and/or people I don't
know - I have had one Melissa, and one I Love You virus. One was sent as a
joke on the 7-11, and the other actually came through email. But first, I
didn't open it - and second - it is harmless in Unix/Linux.

Most recently there are some email viruses that act on Outlook without
being opened, but these are incredibly rare. I'd worry more about the Java
hole in Netscape but I'm not even that worried here.

In other words, listserv email lists are pretty secure...

listserv recently)

Well put, Yunte. And to your warning against making a fetish of "our"
liberal skepticism, I'd only want to add the following:

Most of the rationales here advanced for "not over-reacting," "keeping
things in perspective," "not casting the first stone" have been founded on
an understanding of the U.S. state as involved in many of the same
repressive actions as those used by the Chinese state in the case of Bei
Ling. To which one might say - yes, very true. And there are lists of
examples far longer and uglier than those so far adduced here. COINTELPRO,
anyone? The Philly MOVE bombing? Etc. etc. etc.

All of which says precisely nothing about the qualification of a U.S.
citizen or resident to express political outrage and engage in activism over
a denial of fundamental political rights. We live, in many respects, in a
police state - a lot of us learned that fairly young, say the first time a
thug in blue and black hit us on the head with a big stick for the crime of
holding a cardboard sign. Or, in the case of others I've known, for having
their race act by default as such a sign, thus (from the perspective of
"pro-active enforcement methods") obviating the need that they actually DO
anything to warrant the stick.

Again, though, this says nothing. If we are to maintain the position from
which we can point to these abuses of "our own" government with a
justifiable outrage, we must have recourse to a sense of disjunction between
that state and ourselves. In other words, we are not our bad government - a
government which might in fact be unqualified to say much of anything about
the protection of political liberties, at least in the sense of moral
authority. But if "we" allow the implicit phrase "the U.S. government" to
fill in the content of our first person plural pronoun (i.e., "we're no
better than nation X"), if we allow that repressive state to take on the
contours of our own identity, then we cede the ground from which to register
its outrages AS outrages. The alternative, as I've seen it, has been that
one acts "abroad" (effectively or not is another question) on behalf of
others like Bei Ling for the same reason one thus acts "at home" on behalf
of oneself: out of an understanding that the states committing those
outrages are not representatives of "their" people, but instruments of
domination. In other words, we U.S. people (I know it's an international
list, apologies for all the un-scare-quoted first persons) are "in a
position to say something" about the Chinese state's actions for precisely
the same reason we are in that position with respect to the U.S. state.
Absent that - well, do I really want to mean "FBI/CIA/Pentagon..." every
time I say "I"?

(And it surely is nice to hear from you in this space - it's been a while).

Subject: Bei Ling and Chinese Poetry

As much as I dislike the ways in which contemporary Chinese poetry has been
read in the U.S. (the poetry has been understood mainly as an expression of
a few narrowly defined ideological shibboleths, such as "democracy,"
"individual freedom," "free sex," or what have you), I have to express my
concerns about Bei Ling's fate and I have to say that his arrest still
outrages me.  Sometimes I wonder how far our liberal scepticism can carry
us when we are confronted with some basic facts.  I met Bei Ling a couple
of times in the Boston area (where both of us live) and am quite familiar
with his Chinese literary magazine TENDENCIES, which seems to have now
gotten him into trouble.  According to some mutual friends who just came
back from Beijing and who managed to carry a few copies of the current,
13th issue of the magazine out of China, there's little "subversive"
content in it.  It is mainly the history of Bei Ling's literary activities
(as editors of some overseas literary journals that at times express views
critical of Chinese political culture) that has gotten him blacklisted.
Therefore, I disagree with some of the views expressed earlier on the
Poetics list that caution against over-reaction on "our" part.  I
understand the sound mentality behind such rationales, but in the case of
Bei Ling's arrest, I do believe that the Chinese government should be
condemned for its shameless action.      ----Y.H.

yes, it is.  saw it in Magus a few years back, but i didn't get it.  i am
frankly a big fan of his Minnesota Theory series intros.  his
commentaries/explanations of De Man are the clearest and most sensible
I've ever run into.  I still admire them, though I have begun to accede to
arguments that De Man was the better part a charlatan.  his _The Culture
of Literacy_ is very good, though it is rather a collection of essays, not
all of which are timely.  however, in the theory wars, it is one of the
most lucid and frankly clearly written.  if i see it again, i'll let you
know.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

As we all sat here debating the virtues of helping Bei Ling, one writer
actually did all the work and granted it was Susan Sontag.  Sontag is on the
editorial advisory board of Tendency.  I am a good friend of Bei Ling's and
I happened to write the first proposal for Bei Ling, which was sent to the
National Endowment of Democracy.  Tendency was awarded $20,000 in 1993.
Since then, however, Bei Ling has been publishing Tendency through paltry
funds he makes as a Chinese language instructor and other fellowships that
have dried out for him recently.

I spoke with him for a while yesterday, and he is very happy to be back in
Boston, a place he finds very "peaceful." We talked at length about his
health and the safety of his family.  He is unaware how his parents and
brother are because he was quickly whisked out of the country.  His parents
had to make a large payment to the government for his freedom.  For what?
Because he wants to edit and publish an intellectual journal like all of us
either run and distribute or love to read.

Ms. Sontag told Bei Ling that she devoted an entire week's worth of her
efforts on solely working for his release. She made some phone calls to some
important officials; she wrote the op-ed in the NYT and an open letter that
was published on the front page of Sunday's LA Times Book Review.  I spoke
with the LAT Books Editor, Steve Wasserman, yesterday, and he expressed to
me that he is a friend of Ms. Sontag's and I quote, "Under the
circumstances, she and I both felt we should try to cast as large a public
spotlight on Bei Ling's predicament as we possibly could."

He's a writer for chrissake.  All he wanted to do was write and to
distribute his writing.  It's worth supporting such efforts, for me.

What follows is the OPENING STATEMENT from Tendency No. 1

"In giving the name TENDENCY to our journal of literature and the
humanities, our intention is twofold.  First, the journal tends towards
recreating meaning whose purpose is to build a new cultural environment in a
society of impoverished values.  Second, the journal upholds the principle
of freedom of expression and individual creativity.
   Tendency is not limited to a journal of literature; it extends its scope
by means of literature, and through other modes of discourse, it stretches
towards a broad vision of the problem of human existence.
   Tendency champions a belief in ideals at a time when such belief has been
belittled and misinterpreted.  Furthermore, it draws on the authentic
intellectual spirit which represents a call for responsibility and concern
for social and cultural changes in our time.
   Tendency promotes creative exploration in the realm of letters.  But this
innovative spirit must be tempered by conscious restraint, since freedom in
writing cannot advance without this restraint.
   Tendency exists for people with pure intellects who are yearning to hear
a serious voice."

They have published translations of Sontag, Walter Benjamin, Vaclav Havel,
Solzhenitsyn.  In every issue they publish a list of literary publications
not authorized by the gov't of mainland China.  The publish essays with
titles like "'I Have No Faith in Time' -- Reading Nabokov", "Postmodern,
Post-Colonial Critical Theories and Democracy", "A Review of Avant-Garde
Literature--A Discussion of Writing," "What is World Poetry?  The Anxiety of
Global Influence,"  and "A Relatively New Perspective on Kafka Research."

Bei Ling is free.  He is in Boston.  He is helpful for all the support that
he got.  When I first met him due to communication difficulties, I always
thought he wanted to overthrow the government.  But, that's not it.  It's
more subtle than that.  He wants to live in China and be able to edit,
publish and distribute his magazine.  He wants to foster a serious
intellectual debate among the artists and intellectuals.  He wants to
publish things that are hard to find in China.  He wants a space for
conversation and discourse.  That should be a human right for all people.

There are tentative plans for a press conference at the American PEN Center
in New York City some time next week, but I do not have any hard facts.

Hi Mark -

>Just as a minor side note though, teenagers long ago stopped discussing the
Sex Pistols on the subject of selling out, at least on the basis of the ones
I've talked to recently.

True indeed!  A bad example that happens to be well understood, luckily
enough.

>More seriously, though, I think there's value in questioning a little more
this apparent binary between "pure" social spaces and "assimilation" into
the
academy.

I frankly think it's a dull discussion in any form, anything even related to
it.  But perhaps I assume too easily that people understand these issues,
and maybe they don't.  Maybe many people do need to roll around with the
'sell out/sorta sellout/purely keeping it real' discussion.  For me it is a
snore.

another argument i have some distaste for is the discussion of the inherent
value of a binary description.  whether something is 2-nary or 3-nary or
1,000,000-nary is morally arbitrary to me.  smaller pixels might make for
better resolution but they require more and more work to understand and
differentiate less and less the more that we have.  but morally there's no
difference.  is there something better about 5 than 2?  just because an
argument is quaternary doesn't make it better than any binary argument.
dichotomy, trichotomy, whatever.  if you can tolerate my sense of humor on
this issue, then bear with me -- but frankly it seems as if too many people
have been reading too many poorly written books on eastern philosophy
written by white people who did just a few too many slugs of brown acid in
the 60's.  "like, binary thinking is bad, man."  there's nothing wrong with
binary arguments just because they are binary; there's always more to it.  i
think the moral evaluation of binaries has crept into our thinking as some
sort of cultural truism.

Back to the subject at hand--the Lingua Franca article doesn't ignore the
degrees between the absolutes of purest action and complete selling out.  I
think it gives clear light to efforts of some people to work within the
system and retain some values and yet be willing to flex a little.  Such
in-between activity takes a considerable amount of confidence and maturity
and it embraces the complexity of the world and our lives.  And I think that
in-betweenness is illuminated by Epstein.

>It hardly follows from that point that total assimilation into the academy
is the only other possibility.

Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  From the article it appears that some
like Bernstein and Hejinian go into the academy and even flourish there, but
all the while they are able to maintain some skepticism of the academic
system.  This is clearly not *total* assimilation and the article brings
this out.  And Silliman working for corporate America isn't a complete
sellout either (though the article makes it sound like he is in the
introduction and then later makes it sound like he isn't). The article makes
the point that Ron is publishing on small presses still instead of under the
UChicago and Princeton and Oxford academic logos.

The range, the spectrum, of pure to sellout is a dull one.  Humans want
resources.  Humans need resources.  The combination of want and need for
resources ranges widely and its discussion in the realm of poets is absurd.
No poets are truly getting rich, no one, at least not from poetry.

>So the question for me is not assimilation vs. purity, but assimilation on
what terms, resistance or refusal on what terms? Sadly, Lingua Franca
doesn't
even come close to recognizing that particular problem.

And I think Epstein spent plenty of energy on this, too much perhaps.  It
all gets so ad hominem. Not much needs to be said on this topic.  Follow
your heart, your instincts.  Try your best and stay positive despite the
contrary evidence.  Etc.  It's pretty hallmark but it's true.  The costs of
engaging the things that are messed up are obvious.  People will point at
you and call you a sell-out, or at least respectably discuss it.    It's
what people do.  I cast the first stone.

And it is not really that deep of an insight to see how to affect things and
relationship of one's actions to remaining 'true' and what type of fantasy
world keeping things 'pure' really entails; that realm is for the
misanthrope, the antisocial, the ascetic, the religious zealot, for
political leaders and other masters of cant.  In every action there is a
risk. And in every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, a risk
indeed.  So the risk is certain.

My main criticism and wariness of theory (it is almost impossible for me to
think in other than abstract terms, for better or for worse) is not that it
is inherently bad.  it does however tend to be obfuscating, but that is not
the theory itself; the obfuscation itself usually comes from the idiot
miswielding the theory.  and then there's the puffy-shirt aspect of theory
that I disdain -- people often inflate their own theories with footnotes to
other theories to inflate their own, and usually there is nothing there but
pretty confused interpretations of other theories and not much else.  But
theory itself is a morally neutral tool.  it doesn't seem to make sense to
discuss the righteousness of theory just as it doesn't make sense to discuss
'keeping it real.'

There are many big differences between asking whether Charles Bernstein sold
out because he runs a significant academic department and whether, say,
poetics e-mail lists should be moderated and if they are, what that
represents.  Namely, nothing can be gained anywhere by labeling someone as a
sellout; it's ad hominem, naive, and dull.  But even the latter discussion
is now dull to me and fruitless.  How about *not* suggesting what's right
and wrong about something?  Why cannot someone properly assess the many
threads of poetics out there and put that together in a lingua franca or
some other pub?  it would be much more interesting and even fruitful for
poets and critics and theorists and students.

Tony Green showed great grace and sensitivity to write on 00.08.31:

I think it's already started.

Keep in mind that if you use a mail reader that doesn't "do" HTML e-mail,
then you're completely safe from any malevolent HTML e-mails.

I use Eudora Light 3.1 for Mac, which doesn't translate much -- only bold,
italics, and centering. I don't know if this is true for more recent
versions of Eudora. But there are many choices for reading e-mail beyond
those that came bundled with your web browser.

I think that jd "sandy" mcclatchy's dismissive comments are really one of
those rare instances of folks in the poetry world saying WHAT they REALLY
think about subjects normally resoinding to in semi-polite tones -- reminds
of the awful responce to Ginsberg's Collected when it first appeared by
Richard Howard, et. al. -- like they'd beeen holding back for years and
finally a chance to vent.

Still not sure if a. epstein is totaly sure of what he is talking about & i
think that teaching & tenure is only part of the world of official poetry --
give a look at all the poetry summer camps & conferences that are advertised
in APR & poets & writers -- they are a solid bastion of privelege for
mainstream MFA programs & what can boost an academic salary into the six
figure zone.

i do think the early bold statements of bernstein, silliman, et. al. cica
1978 reflects the politics of the pre-Regan era and the state of academia in
that period, when Iowa School writing was still ascendant and post-modern
strategies were still scene as radical

Thanks to everyone who sent suggestions to me front & back channel for my
visual arts/literature course.  The Gaddis was a particularly appealling
suggestion, but I wasn't brave enough in the end, I suppose, to spend a month
on it with my class.  Some books I did decide to use--Wyndham Lewis's
autobiography, Fowles' _The Ebony Tower_, Stein's Portraits. . . .

Again,  thank you!

As the author of the Lingua Franca article that people have been discussing
the last few days, I thought I'd introduce myself (to those who don't know
me) and briefly respond.

First, as many of you know (or at least know now), I'm a list member (and
have been for about five years). Second, it's been interesting to read the
various perspectives about the article thus far.  While I'm all for lively
debate and thoughtful commentary, I do think it makes sense for people to
actually read the whole piece (not just "accounts" of it -- see Robert
Corbett's recent post, and its "apparent argument" -- see Shelley Brennan;
and not just the title page, pull quotes, or photos, chosen by the editors
of course), before evaluating it, its alleged biases, and its intent.  Why
assume that the "venue predetermines the complaint" (Shelley Brennan) and
the article's slant without reading the piece for yourself?

For what it's worth, it seems to me that many of the issues people have said
the article misses or trivializes are at least addressed in the article, if
not at its very center, and that the so-called evil detractors of langpo are
not presented as "right-thinking people" (Robert Corbett's phrase) but
rather as
voices in a complicated and multi-sided debate.

Take care,

Andrew (do "we" know this guy) Epstein


P. S.  I am also posting my back-channel exchange with Mark Wallace about
"assimilation vs. purity" that Mark and I agreed to forward to the list.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

There are valid grounds for identifying LangPo w/ the academy--even if its
presence in most literature departments is practically non-existent, as
Perlman is right to suggest.   Significantly, for example, Bernstein's
insistence in _A Poetics_ on refusing the persuasiveness of rhetoric--& his
concommitant recoil from the aesthetic-- is matched by theory's assumption
(e.g. in the New Historicism) of a certain critical and anaesthetic distance
from the "literary artifact" for the purpose, ultimately, of *demystifying*
it.  Both share what is, pretty plainly, a puritanical attitude toward the
reader's susceptibility to pleasure in the actual experience of his/her
engagement with a poem.  In the academy, what a poem *means* is, for this
reason, entirely more important than its affect.  Ph.D's (& Ph.D's
soon-to-be, like myself) function, in a sense, as bureaucrats, surveiling &
adjudicating the poem's *real* meaning which, naturally, is never what it
appears to be, as appearances themselves--by reason of the pleasure they
give--are assumed to be misleading (by "pleasure" understand that I am giving
a shorthand for what is really *intense* feeling--the opposite of pleasure
being then, not "pain," but, as Dave Hickey puts it, "the banality of neutral
comfort."  The false dichotomy between pleasure & disgust is, by the way,
Sianne Ngai's basic mistake in her recent brilliant essay in _Open Letter_).
In any case, it goes w/out saying , I think, that a lot of awfully boring
Language-influenced poetry (including some of my own) is advanced or
published for *therapeutic* reasons--that is, because it is supposedly good
for us.

Nothing, however, is more potentially disruptive of the status quo than
pleasure--it's amazing as well as scary, really, what you & I are capable of
getting off on.  Pleasure--or beauty, as Dave Hickey has argued too (in
essays that crucially inform this post)--is also *essentially democratic* in
that there is a **vernacular** of beauty or pleasure that enfranchises
audiences and acknowledges their power  (& by audience, I don't mean the
ghettoized audience of the poetry world or of academia).  Indeed, it is not
criticism that is politically efficacious so much as the assent or "praise"
an audience gives to the persuasive power of a poem--the vernacular of
pleasure or beauty is thus always a quality that is politicized in one way or
another, rather than neutralizing politics (which is what I find so
fascinating about Maria Damon's inclusion, in her book, of the poetry of
women living in housing projects, or, for that matter, about prison poetry).
This is something quite different, I think, from "dumbing down."  Still,
poetry can never be politically efficacious unless it moves a non-specialist
or non-professional audience--in the way Pop art did, say.  Art, in fact, is
only transgressive, as Hickey puts it, if Jesse Helms says it is:
"Regardless of what the titillated cognoscenti might flatter themselves by
believing, if you dealt in transgression, insisted upon it, it was always the
Senator, only the Senator . . .  whose outrage mattered."  Helms, of course
may not know squat about art, but his business, after all, *is* rhetoric .

Of course, there is a lot of LangPo which would be powerfully affective--even
to an uninitiated audience-- but the emphasis has always been someplace else,
too focused, like the academy, on critique, & on a therapeutic model of
aesthetic experience & too suspicious of *content* in its valorization of
transgressive *form*.  (But, in fact, a lot of putatively anti-LangPo
poetries are equally therapeutic in intent--the suspicion of pleasure has
almost become reflexive today.  Indeed, the return to lyricism typical of a
lot of recent NY School-inspired poetry only strikes me most of the time as
completely & banally comfortable & self-satisfied.)  We need poems, in other
words, as ravishingly beautiful & political as Mapplethorpe's _X Portfolio_,
Cindy Sherman's _Doll Photos_, or Burroughs' _Naked Lunch_.

FRINGE FESTIVAL PRESS RELEASE

        BENJAMIN, an innovative multi-media opera based on the life of the great
modern German-Jewish philosopher and literary critic, Walter Benjamin
(1892-1940), will be presented in a concert version at this year's
Philadelphia Fringe Festival.   Times and dates of the performances are as
follows: September 13th and 14th at 7 PM, September 15th at 9:30 PM and
September 16that 7:30 PM.  Tickets are $10, and all performances are at the
Old First Reform, 153 N. 4th Street, Philadelphia.
        The opera, interweaving voice, instrumental and computer altered music with
the spoken word, explores Benjamin's involvement in the cultural and
political movements and catastrophes of the first half of the Twentieth
Century.  The work focuses on central dramatic moments in Benjamin's complex
heroic and often contradictory life, his friendships with his Marxist lover
Asja Lacis, the playwright Berthold Brecht, and the philosophers Gershom
Scholem and Theodore Adorno.
        The music is by the award winning Philadelphia composer, Ellen Fishman
Johnson.  The libretto is by the widely published poet and essayist, Michael
Heller.  Both composer and poet were drawn to the moving story of Benjamin's
life, his moral depth, his search for personal and social salvation, and his
fate as a creative individual enmeshed in the terrible history of our times.

Hello Andrew:

        I think I was replying as much to Patrick
Herron's looking at the problem of a simple binary as I was to what
your article in Lingua Franca was doing, so perhaps I caused a little bit
of confusion there, for which I apologize. On the other hand, I'm not sure
I quite see where the article takes on the issue I was getting at, which
is given that some degree of assimilation is unavoidable, what is to be
done with it? For me that's where the problem actually STARTS, although
yes, I think maybe the last sentence of your piece, and a couple of the
Bernstein quotes, imply that such a problem is at stake. The Evans quotes
suggest that one still CAN divide the spaces into the binary I think we
need to avoid, at least as I read him, but I'll have to go back and look
at that again.

        I'm sorry then if my post on one particular aspect of this problem
seemed like a wholesale condemnation of your article, when in fact I was
just taking issue with the idea that such a binary exists, that the choices
are either total purity or total assimilation.

        I'd be happy to post this publically, if you wanted to do the same
with yours.

        Mark

Well, it's time for the Fringe Festival again....with lots in store.....be=20
sure to pick up the guide in the current issue of Citypaper......and find=20
what you like

There will be plenty of theater, music, and art that fits between categories=
.

Opening night is this Friday (9/1)...and it's First Friday....there will be=20
the fringe fest parade from 6:00 till 6:30 that starts and ends at the=20
national showroom..........

some things to keep in mind this year.....there are 10 different fringe=20
buttons.....that are made by artists...and are $5, but do not give a discoun=
t=20
on the shows, as in past years....they do give discounts to various=20
businesses, see the guide for a list of participating businesses.

The way to get discounts to see shows....is by buying booklets of=20
coupons....each coupon has a value of $5 when presented at a venue...or when=
=20
buying a ticket for a show.....but each coupon costs only $4.50 or $4.00,=20
depending on how many you buy.

by the way, all the shows are priced in increments of $5, so shows are free,=
=20
or $5, or $10, or $15........if no price is mentioned in the guide,,.....it=20
is $10

so, if you use 2  $4.00 coupons, to buy a $10 ticket, the cost to you is onl=
y=20
$8.00

my favorite event at the Fringe is free....it is the Late Night=20
Cabaret.....and is every night....9/1-9/16  at  10pm or 11pm...at 211 Race=20
St., (the building with all the cake frosting on the front, part of the=20
Visual Fringe), you get to see all different things...snippets of fringe=20
shows...etc.....this is a great place to hang out and meet everybody, since=20
by 11, there are not any other shows. You have to be over 21 to get in.

Another thing to mention is where the box office is....it is at the National=
=20
Showroom, 113 N.2nd St., 215-413-1318, you can phone in your ticket orders
or show up, and look at all the posters/flyers

below are some things that look good.....there are lots of other good things=
,=20
too

specific theater....from what i hear....there are 30 venues, but each show=20
covers only 15, so you have to see it 4 times to see it all, .... i hear tha=
