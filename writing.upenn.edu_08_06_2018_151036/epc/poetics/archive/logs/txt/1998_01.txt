NEW YEARS EVE

[This is a real-time piece, if you read it fast. You should arrive at the
inbuilt markers on time, except at the end, which should run about 20
seconds over.  One moral purpose of this piece, which I read at the "First
Night" celebrations in Santa Rosa last night, failed miserab ly, as a
subsequent reader went on and on for 11 minutes.     Poets!]

I have five minutes to read in.  That's not very long, although it is 300
seconds.   Memory has to come into it.  You have to remember how long a
second is.  We're going to welcome 1998 to all 4 time zones.  You count
back from ten on New Years Eve and you do it in a crowd.  You count back
from 100 going under anesthetic and you do it alone.   But you usually
don't get any further than 97.  The story of how a second got to be as long
as it is is most interesting, but I'm afraid we won't have time for that
right now.  Let's just say that a second occurs more often than a blue
moon. Yet one second is long enough to see you standing alone. Is one not
surpisingly enough never in the second as it moves, where "is" means
attentive to, just that the prior seconds are still processing? So each
second of the second hand is secondhand. They cluster, grapes on the vine,
except one can't pick and choose.  Not that I want to get stuck in the
second.  There are smaller units of time, and there are much larger ones,
for example the minute. These everyday measures, minutes, seconds, even
hours, we take so lightly, carelessly, speak of so glibly. I've probably
been talking for a minute, or you have, if you're reading this and not
hearing me say it at a poetry reading. Should this be being said, at a
reading of poetry? That would mean this is a poem, instead of a talk on
time.  Or that there'd been an error of some kind. But back then about
three lines of prose, I guessed that a minute had gone by, since I started
making these words do what they wanted me to do with them. That's glib, but
I haven't enough time to be consistently careful, if a minute had gone by
back then, probably another half a minute has gotten back to town by now,
which means a minute and a half of my allotment has been used up already,
or 3/10ths, almost one third.  Probably by now one-third of the time has,
had passed.  Not that we see time pass, not customarily.  Down in the
boondocks, perhaps. But usually we don't see time pass, since we pass with
it. It is us, isn't it? Who else could see a tree grow in the middle of the
forest,  cut it down, slice it open, count its rings, register its age?  We
nouns are really verbs. Doo-wah diddy diddy dum diddy doo, there can't be
more than 3 minutes left. If I make a five-minute span equal to an average
lifetime, though, I am only thirty, though, at this moment.  The duration
of a moment is not as fixed as that of a second or a minute. We don't make
clocks that tick off the moments. Some moments appear to last forever.
What is a moment? it is a brief lapse. A trice. A jiffy. An instant.  In a
moment something momentous might take place, although time is not a measure
of space. It might be an historical era, it might be a second. Second is to
come next, after the first. A heartbeat now because there was one just
then. Musically, a second can be an interval, but then what ends the
interval but a note, and that note might last a second. Or longer. Music
orders time, by keeping pace with time it eliminates it. Is a person more
in touch with time when he or she goes sideways, as it were, as I have been
doing in these recent sentences, or when we insist on a path or way,  some
passage of time in some defining encampment? Like here we are now, studying
my time dribbling away. I'm sure three minutes are gone. I cannot tell a
lie. I was 30 or appeared 30 only yesterday, only a minute ago actually,
and now I'm 45! In the old days, I would have been dead already. Thought
would have ceased.  But here I am, pushing 50, still thinking, thinking,
for instance, in this instant, that I'm capable of thought, why does the
sun go on shining, why does the sea rush to shore. If I have only a minute
and thirty seconds left, let me make use of those 90 seconds in a measured,
calm, fruitful manner. Why does my heart go on beating, as it beat in '63?
Who was on keyboards? What Faustian bargain had I driven? I had learned
language only to piss the time away?  We don't always know just how long we
have, the way I do today, but we do know we have a certain length of time,
though unknown, and then, no more.  We don't go around ever-mindful of
this, I hope, for I would find that paralyzing. Knowing exactly how long
one has, on the other hand, panics me. Just a moment. What is a moment?
Take a small glass, fill with orange juice. Drink it. Immediately refill
glass with non-dairy creamer. Drink.  A moment can mean a minute.  In the
movie "Hour of the Wolf," there is one minute of real time where the actors
on-screen hold their deliberate silence. It feels like forever. Let me do
that now.

  [15 second pause]

Yes, a minute. Good. In an average lifetime, that would equal nearly 4
years. Just a minute, the teenager said from behind her door, but she
didn't mean to be taken literally. Literally, a minute is defined as 1/60th
of an hour. Great. "Minute" is related to "my-newt. "  "My-newt" means very
small, and yet that minute we observed silently seemed  long enough, to me.
In an average lifetime we can expect billions of minutes, and this may make
us careless. We may leave things to the last minute.  Ten, nine. The
hourglass, inverted 4 minutes ago, lets gravity trickle its sand into the
overcrowded bottom half, a kind of symbol of the future, as the past
rapidly empties out like a theater in which someone has lately
shouted-Eight. Tock,  the only answer to Tick. Seven. The stay has not
arrived from the Governor.  Six. If wants to be the same, the same as is.
Five. Time held me green and dying, though I sang in my chains like the-
Four. Where are the snows of yester-Three. Old age, what a strange thing to
happen to a boy. Two. More light! One. Amstel Light. Z-z-z--I heard a fly
buzz when I died--Z-z-z-z-Zorro to the rescue! I can go over my time, he

early childhood, the adolescent years, the troubles of early maturity,
which in your case came late, tell us one of those stories of yours that
begins "Shortly before I was born"!  It may be our phone, but it's your 35
cents!  Thank you, Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z......

Thank you all for your valiant efforts to keep the list afloat. I guess it's
my turn to jump into the pool (blame it on Bromige: he told me to stop
lurking).  Anyway, a  friend of mine recently posed the question, "What is the

This question of Bobbie West's friend about the purpose of poetry is the
easiest one I've had all year.  Answer: the purpose of poetry is to
achieve Beauty through the maximally-expressive use of words.

Beauty?  Expressive?  As purpose/means?

Nonono.

(But note she doesn't put up her own "answer."  Just shy I guess.)

Nonsense.  There are always purposes for everything.

The purpose of a flower is to attract bees.
The purpose of a rock is to smash bees with.
The purpose of us is to smash bees with rocks.
The purpose of poetry is to smash flowers.

Q: Why are you writing that?
A: Because flowers are full of bees.

Take my New years Eve poem as instance. I was irritated that more readers
were being shoehorned into a finite allotment of time, and that each
person's moiety was therefore to be reduced. This was at a planning
luncheon. I didnt express my irritation, because there was no chance of
winning the fight, so why fight? But it stayed with me, and by next day I
wrote the first draft of a real-time piece on the topic of limited time. So
that piece expresses my irritation, but I think it disguises what it
expresses. I hope so. What is more vital to me is that the disguise plays
with a variety of purposes to which we put our time. In my mind, the
purpose of the piece is minatory, first and foremost, is another way of
saying Carpe Diem. An ancillary purpose was to keep those reading after me
(I elected to read 3rd) mindful of the 5-minute limit(I have often noted at
these "monster" readings, that poets go way over their allotment. While I
appreciate that poets are transgressive, I dont appreciate it when they
trespass on my time, or that of others, and this is not only by reducing
further our allotments, but by making us sit there for longer).This poem
may have had this effect on some, but on one as I say it made no dent. I
wanted the piece to dance questions about finitude and its role in
creativeness. And I wanted people to appreciate what "five minutes" can be.
I wanted to take back the clock. And yes, I wanted a form for my anxiety
about running out of time in a larger sense. I mean thats a free-floater
thats liable to attach anywhere it can. I wanted to entertain and amuse. I
wanted people to like me. And I wanted to do it by getting in their faces a
little. I'm sure there's more to it than this.

Bob Grumman's definition I can have no quarrel with, because it is so
abstract. Au fond, who knows? it might apply to my poem, and to any poem.
But at some intermediate stage of responding to Bobby West's question, this
above is what I say.  David

Poetry adds volcanic islands to the sea along its unseen ridges. Whether
it has a purpose or not, wings cross it, roost, drop white nitrogen &
seeds, raise a greenness. If springs rise with their magma, its islands
invite refuge, treasure-stash, settlement -- purpose. Not poetry's
purpose, or even the poem's, but purpose without which poem and poetry
remain vacuous except to fencebuilding finches. A poet may, like Tom
Sawyer with his whitewash pot, have a purpose, but had better not name
it "painting the fence." Remember, though: even Tom has to start the
paint job -- & make it look more interesting than anything else in the
carefree days of childhood. How long does it take the painters to get
the knack, to spot the trick, to offer to paint a fence? How many paint
the fence alone? To what purpose? Ever make a salt map of the sea floor,
then paint in the water? It makes the islands credible, attractive,
worth naming. But you paint it anyway.

Poetry adds volcanic islands to the sea along its unseen ridges. Whether
it has a purpose or not, wings cross it, roost, drop white nitrogen &
seeds, raise a greenness. If springs rise with their magma, its islands
invite refuge, treasure-stash, settlement -- purpose. Not poetry's
purpose, or even the poem's, but purpose without which poem and poetry
remain vacuous except to fencebuilding finches. A poet may, like Tom
Sawyer with his whitewash pot, have a purpose, but had better not name
it "painting the fence." Remember, though: even Tom has to start the
paint job -- & make it look more interesting than anything else in the
carefree days of childhood. How long does it take the painters to get
the knack, to spot the trick, to offer to paint a fence? How many paint
the fence alone? To what purpose? Ever make a salt map of the sea floor,
then paint in the water? It makes the islands credible, attractive,
worth naming. But you paint it anyway.

Sorry if you got my reply to Bobbie West twice -- I received a 'message
not sent' from Tony Lopez' mail administrator, & didn't know whether
that would inferfere with transmission of the post to everyone else on
teh list or not, so I reposted. Then, of course, I realized that it
probably affects only Tony's mail. Has anyone gotten through to him yet?

i think isnt there a significant difference between th question
"what is the purpose of poetry?" & "what is the purpose of this
particular poem" (or "what is the author's purpose behind the
poem s/he wrote?")...    drawing these distinctions cuz ov my own
belief that "poetry" is more than sum total of a corpus ov poems,
but the whole social construct of attending to some instances of
language ("poems") as different in kind from other non-poetic
instances...   so that th orginal question--what is the specific
purpose of _poetry_, distinguised from the purpose(s) of language
in general--seems interesting to me, in ways that questions about
the meaning of life dont...   i dont have an answer.

one good question deserves another:

       what is the poetry of a purpose?

&/or little variations thereon ---

e.g. what poetry does a purpose have?
what's the poetry of purpose & how might it compare w/
the poetry of purposelessness? (cf. Zhuang-zi / Chuang-Tse)

"What is the purpose of poetry?"

Well, interesting enough a subject for a slow list. I would base the way
I answer the question on the asker. If it's a fellow smarty-pants, then
I'd probably make some kind of flippant answer, but if it's a friend who
is seriously asking because s/he wants to know why I write, I'd say some
of the things that inspire me, but if s/he seriously wants me to answer
the question as stated and no other question, then I'd refill the coffee
cups and begin with defining what poetry is. By the time I finished
that, assuming I didn't encounter too much resistance to my quirky
definition, the answer would be obvious. I can guarantee an argument to
my quirky definition, though, so my answer would probably not be
accepted. For what it is worth, I view all drama (including movies and
opera), all songs (including pop), all narrative (including jokes) as
types of poetry. I don't use the word to mean "good" arrangements of
words, I just use it to refer to any art made out of words. That's the
classical definition, and it's good enough for me. So anyone who doesn't
feel a need to ask what's the purpose of a sit-com or a rock song,
shouldn't need to ask what is the purpose of poetry. Memory, of course.

The somewhat more flippant answer, and possibly more true is that there
is no such thing as this "poetry" refered to in the question. There are
only people who write poems. Each poem has its own purpose. Unlike l-b
drake I don't think there is any "whole" that exceeds the sum of these
poems. In fact, when most people mention this mythical beast "poetry",
they usually refer to only a small subset of remembered poems.

So those are my two answers that seem to negate each other. One in which
the word includes so much it can't possibly be defined except so loosely
that the question is moot, and the other in which the word is dismissed
as a myth. Perhaps that's because we have no rigid rules to follow when
writing poems these days. Perhaps the question is seeking a set of such
rules. People who want to write within rules should write formal work
like movie scripts or rock songs and keep away from the more esoteric
areas where writing-by-numbers is frowned on. In these areas, certain
Yankee values of individualism and self-reliance are expected and any
obedience to external forms is considered a weakness.

Still, at its core, writing is an act of remembering. What is the
purpose of remembering?

So that the world is not lost, and maybe that's a purpose for poetry too.

I agree with David Bromige that my answer to the purpose of poetry is,
as stated, way too abstract to be of use.  However, if one understands
the terms "beauty," "poetry" and "expression" as I do (at an even higher
level of abstraction!), it's not too useless.

I don't have time now to get into George Bowering's responses, "Why
beauty?" and "Why expressive?" but will say: (1) the reason I don't
commit suicide is that I believe happiness is possible for me and other
human beings; there is only pleasure/pain, happiness/unhappiness; beauty
as I define it is a form of mainly sensual/sensory happiness, a
particular form of which should be the ultimate aim of poetry, as I
define it; (2) words express, that's why "expressive"; they are also
sensually pleasurable in themselves auditorily and visually, which I
left out in my answer because I was rushing too much as usual.

So here's my revised answer:  The purpose of poetry is to achieve Beauty
through the maximally-expressive and sensually-rich use of words.

A few days ago I watched a video called "Troublesome Creek" which was a
documentary about a farm family (much like my grandparents') in Iowa
trying to keep it going.  The 2 images that struck me the most in this
well-pictographed picture were 1) the long grass along the flat dirt roads
always swaying in the wind and 2) the crowd of farmers collected in the
January cold to respond by slight flicks & winks to the incredibly
fast-talking auctioneer of all the family's household goods.

Words are an inside thing, a human invention, a mirror.
It's a good mirror in that it grasps & captures & replays
the whole outside.  This is what verbal intelligence does,
encapsulates what's going on. (Of course it only feels right
if the outside is really in there.)

Poetry's a version of that, only it makes the mirror sing.
A harmony of thought brought to equivalent expression in language.
So harmonious that sometimes the outside rightfully becomes the
inside or vice-versa or verse-visa.

Now what's the purpose of that?
Sing, sing, sing along...
you find yourself singing along with the "Ode to a Tin Ear".

p.s. I have an essay in the latest WITZ sort of tongue-in-cheeking this issue

Ooops, I forgot the conceptual in my answer to the question about the
purpose of poetry, something that came up in back-channels with Judy
Roitman, so I have a second revision of my answer:

The purpose of poetry is to achieve Beauty through the maximally-
expressive, sensually-rich and aesthetico-conceptually-intense use of
words--aesthetico-conceptual having to do with what words are or do
conceptually (e.g., Aram Saroyan's "lighght" conceptualizes silence),
and the abstract form, harmonies, etc., of individual poems.

pressing a small point (but do we really disagree?)--it's exact that
mythology which interests me in th question, and mythology ov course
is "real" if only (because it is) image-inary...   refering to those
specific or small subsets of individual poems is only different than
that larger abstraction (not better/worse); and so bromige's fine
examination of his purpose in that particular poem i thingk begs th
larger question*...   what's the purpose, culture's purpose, in
privilaging (underprivilaging?) some small subset (differently
remembered by each participant in th culture) of it's utterance
as "poetry"?  as sed, i'm not sure ov an answer, tho i suspect it's
more than bob g's quantitative "maximized" measure ov pleasurable
expression...


lbd



*unless, i suppose, some aggregate examination of individual poems
revealed some common purpose--to delight & instruct, frinstance?--
but that's old news...   (that stays news?...)

When you learned your 1st words from mother or father it was delight
& instruction & strenuous exercise all in one. (My mother wrote down
my 1st 2 words: "door" & "flower" - do I believe that?.)  You've
been repeating them in complicated variations ever since. Especially
when you learned that the flower grows at the doorstep & blooms on
the Day of the Dead.

I thought poetry wasn't supposed to have a purpose! "I/they don't have no
function." Then Mary Burger restated this idea in Laura Moriarty's _non_
(http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~moriarty) and the ale fell from my hand.
Thank heavens for fallback positions -- poetry is celebration! You write
it when you are happy or having some other feeling you want to give other
people and to have again yourself, and when you go back, the feeling is
there. The rest is tenure.

Jor D hit it in a nutshell, I reckon, & to put the same thing in
Kosmo-Classic perspective, as (who?) O. Mandelstam says someplace,
"poetry is the plow bringing the deep layers of time up to the surface."
- or something like that.

To illustrate, here's an early poem by that human headache, Henry Gould:

the well is always there
a decade of water
the soldiers pass by
& today the girls are among the clowns
each hiding an arm or wearing a red dance
standing around the well always there

(1971)

Here's the corrected version of the early Gould poem posted earlier.

the well is always there
a decade of water
just a well
the soldiers pass by
& today the girls are among the clowns
each hiding an arm or wearing a red dance
standing around the well always there
(1971)

- when I asked him which version he approved of now, I couldn't get a
straight answer.  He said, "Well, it is just a well.
Try it to the tune of 'Down in the Valley'."  (I did, with no luck.)

The printed version can be found in his Hellcoal Press chapbook of 1972
called (yes this is the real title) "Where the Skies Are Not Cloudy All Day".
There the poem includes the following quote, from Horizon Magazine (1971):

"The letters add to the elegance of a structure, even if their meaning is
hid from those not familiar with the language.  Here, they tell how a piece
of the True Cross was discovered in 1045 and preserved in the building.
The entire roof has collapsed, the interior yawning hollowly in the
direction of the Soviet Union."

(It's a good question whether such "inscriptions" add to the elegance of
a poem or not.  I asked Gould about this too, and again he was,
as Blarnes would put it, noncommittal, or "chiffery-chaffery".
He said, and I quote & I quote & I quote again quote:

"This particular thing, or what?  Well, I didn't write it, did I?
I stole it outa some magazine, Jack.  If it means something to you,
then, well, you probably shouldna read it in the first place.
Hey, can I borrow your hat tonight?  I need to busk down in the Ken
Station & raise some jimmy."   [is he referring to Jimi Hendrix here?]

apparently my older sister's first word was "reflection," after my father
repeatedly showed her the way the river (hudson) cast moving squiggles of
light on the living room wall, and, of course, in connection w/ this
showing, repeated the word "reflection" a number of times.  this legend
passed into the myth of her general intellectual superiority, which seems
to have gone unnoticed by her but absorbed by me, just as the myth of *my*
intellectual superiority seems to have gone unnoticed by me but absorbed by
her (who pointed it out to me 34 yrs after the supposed fact).  i have no
idea what my first words were.

A Special Notice and Offer

A month ago I presented a special offer to Sulfur magazine subscribers who
might wish to acquire the volume of Clayton Eshleman=92s selected literary
essays titled Antiphonal Swing, which I brought out several years ago.
You=92re probably aware of Eshleman=92s editorial and critical contributions=
 to
American poetics: his successive editorial stewardship of Caterpillar and
Sulfur magazines has had a profound influence on progressive and
experimental areas of American poetry. For many years Eshleman has written
incisive, provocative, even feisty essays on numerous poets and movements,
as well as on the related subjects of translation, apprenticeship, and the
paleolithic roots of consciousness =97 all of which are covered in this
rather large volume.
eneral one.=20

To bring this book within reach of almost everyone who may be interested,
and because I=92d like to continue to publish books like Antiphonal Swing =
=97
by Clayton as well as other writers =97 I am extending the Sulfur offer to
the Poetics List.

The list price of this 264-page hardcover book is $25. You may order it
postpaid for $20 (in effect you are paying $17 for the book, a 32%
discount, since we ship all orders via $3 priority mail). If you like, we
can also send the book as a gift to another address, at your instruction.
This one-time offer is limited to individuals, and all orders must be
postmarked by February 20, 1998. A more complete description of the book
follows below, along with reviews and a mail-order form. Please don=92t send

Clayton Eshleman / Antiphonal Swing:Selected Prose
Edited by Caryl Eshleman
Introduction by Paul Christensen

Thirty-four essays, interviews and prose poems by this famous poet and
translator explore theories of the contextual fabric of World poetry, and
describe the development of Eshleman=92s  unique poetic vision in a
penetrating reevaluation of the roots of consciousness. This important
volume gathers selections from his dialogues with James Hillman as well as
introductions from two of his most distinguished volumes of poetry. There
is also a discussion of the narrative elements in Upper Paleolithic cave
art; a provocative essay on the art of translation; and critical appraisals

content to read in books what the terms the life worth living might consist
of; he goes where he feels he can establish, by his own lived proof, the
nature of human archaeology layer by layer.... He works at archaeological
digs, so to speak, but most of the time attempts to transcend his findings,
to propose them as evidence of a longer record: the very bloodline linking
our postmodern time to its discernible genesis." =97 Gene Frumkin, Manoa

My good friend, the novelist and poet Richard Elman, died of lung cancer on
December 29th. He was 63. He was diagnosed three months ago. The doctors
had given him two years at the outside, so none of us who loved him were
prepared, if preparation is ever possible.
Richard acknowledged something like 24 books. There were also several ghost
projects, including much of Albert Goldman's biography of Lenny Bruce, and
a series of "novelizations" that he churned out for quick cash in the 70's.
Film companies, for reasons of their own that I think have to do with
copyright, commission novels based on original screenplays. The books and
the films appear simultaneously. These books always sink like stones,
usually for good reason. The only one Richard signed was his novelization
of Taxi Driver. If you ever spot it on the paperback shelf in a used
bookstore grab it--it's better than the movie.
I think only two of Richard's books are in print: _Cathedral-Tree-Train and
Other Poems_ from Junction Press and _Tar Beach_ from Sun&Moon. Sun&Moon is
issuing _Love Handles_ in the fall.
The Times, which favored _Tar Beach_ with one of its one paragraph reviews,
loved the book, naming it one of the ten best of 1992. But it praised it,
oddly, as an "elegant slice-of-life."  It's anything but. This may be the
only novel ever written in which all of the characters are naked, a boy
loses his innocence to a sexy girl angel (in the synagogue, no less), and
some of the dialogue is in Sviddish, a combination of Swedish, Swahili and
Yiddish.
One of Richard's earlier books, _The Menu Cypher,_ was a sequel to _The
Breadfruit Lotteries,_ an elegant and straightforward spy story about a
Columbia Lit professor who is also a CIA operative. _Lotteries_ did well,
so MacMillan picked up the sequel for its spy and mystery offerings. What
they got begins with a glossary of food terms and their secret equivalents,
followed by a chapter set in the Columbia faculty club, which turns out to
be a den of spies speaking in menu cypher. This is hillarious until one of
the profs is murdered. Later in the book we listen to the killer's
personality dissolve in a series of unanswered telegrams. The crime novel
critics were clueless, and MacMillan allowed the book to die.
I don't want to suggest that Richard was in any sense self-consciously an
experimental writer. He wrote. He wrote a great and formally conventional
hollocaust trilogy; a coming-of-age-novel, _Fredi&Shirl&the Kids,_ that
reads like a perverse script for a 50's sitcom; _The Poor-House State,_
non-fiction, one of the best things ever written about poverty in America;
_Uptight with the Rolling Stones,_ a tour book; _Cocktails at Somoza's,_
journalism from the Nicaraguan revolution and its aftermath; and a lot more.
In one of the stories in Richard's collection _Crossing Over_ the
protagonist says that not writing is "like eating sawdust." Richard never
ate much sawdust. Once he called me in despair, saying that he couldn't
write anymore. It had been two weeks. Three days later he called and began,
his voice brimming with suppressed delight, and asked, as he often did, if
he could read me something (I have had all of _Love Handles_ read to me on
the phone, altho I've never seen a word of typescript). It was several
chapters of a new novel.
In almost thirty years of close friendship I never heard Richard talk about
theory.
What was he like? Richard and his wife Alice adopted an enormous stray
English sheepdog that they named Loki. Loki's body always seemed too large
for his mind to control. He was a generous-hearted dog, loyal to a fault,
and given to impish pranks, but because of his ungainliness he was always
breaking things. It was as if different parts of his body were responding
simultaneously to the pull of different stimuli. All of which made domestic
life a little difficult. He was at times the despair of those who
nonetheless loved him.
Richard was enormously tall, and I'm 5'6". We must have looked like Mutt
and Jeff. In the midst of a walk down to the beach near his house in Stony
Brook he would suddenly burst forth in a snatch of Yiddish theater that his
parents must have sung around the house that had somehow come up at that
moment, or he would curl his long body down to my eye level to tell me the
crazy thought that had just flashed across his brain pan, waiting for my
approval as he not so much laughed as chuffed or snuffled, or, if it was a
more formal shtick, he would look at me out of the corner of his eye and
send out short bursts of questioning laughter, punctuated by expectant
silence: "Hunh?...Hunh?..."
How do I convey to strangers what I loved about the man? He was the soul of
generosity. Without affectation and without regard for the usual categories
he treated everyone the same, so that my son mourns him as a friend, not as
his father's friend.
As a poet, although he had read everything, Richard was something of a
naif; "Cathedral-Tree-Train" is nonetheless, despite its ineptitudes, one
of the best serial poems of recent years.
Richard died in the company of the three women he loved, his wife Alice and
his daughters Margaret and Lila. As he lay unconscious in the hospital,
perhaps beyond hearing, they read his poems to him. I wish I could have
been there with them.

Comments: To: POETICS@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu

Bobbie West, testing her new de-lurking device,  wrote

>  "What is the purpose of poetry?"

-- meaning the Poet's purpose, the Poem's purpose, or the purpose of
Poetry itself?

e.g., david bromige, referring to his wonderful New Year's Eve poem, wrote


> Take my New years Eve poem as instance. . . I wanted the piece to
> dance questions about finitude and its role in  creativeness. And
> I wanted people to appreciate what "five minutes" can be.  I wanted
> to take back the clock. And yes, I wanted a form for my anxiety about
> running out of time in a larger sense. [and more . . .]

which speaks about the *poet's* purposes. Those could be anything from
wanton manipulation for personal gain ("I Like Ike") to exploration or
aggrandizement of the self to bringing something to light or anything
else human beings may intend. Or could be non-purpose, simply to sing
like the birdies sing, the song emerging because it does

but then any poem may have its own intentions, unknown to, Other
than, even at odds with, the poet's.  The poet's purpose may thwart the
poem's, or succumb to it, or the two may dance, each feeding the pulse
of the other, or sing in symbiosis like a tree along a stream

and Poetry, as continuous stream of energy making forms flow from the
unseen into the world and back out again like any living or non-living
Thing, Poetry in other words as a God, no doubt has its own intentions.
what does (not, this poet or this poem), what does Poetry *itself*
intend? (like James Hillman writes, What does Love want? Not this woman
or that man but what does Love *itself* want???)

Poetry's intentions like the intentions of any God are no doubt a
Mystery. We serve a Goddess we can never truly know, existing as
we do within her body. Maybe She wants to remind us of something,
something we never quite recall except in moments that leave us
remembering, at best, only that we remembered. To re-member us
or wake us to some possibility or even draw us forward to
something not yet ever known

maybe a long study of history to see what She has done, or a close look
around us to see what She does would let us say something about her
purpose -- *if* we can assume more congruence between her intentions
and her effects than we mere mortals enjoy. Maybe we could glimpse it in
the aftermath of composition. Perhaps such studies could be acts of
veneration. Maybe we could say in faith, She must know what She's doing.
Maybe we could confess (as the twelve steps of PA remind us), We are in
the throes of a Power greater than ourselves.

maybe porpoise rises, cries out, sinks back into depths, papoose
carries the sleeping future, papyrus, maybe a paper on the papacy. Maybe
the perfect pose, maybe prophecy

who knows?

Geez, Bob, how do you define Beauty? This seems to me to be either
definition by footnotes or definition in need of definition, which cd. keep
us talking for weeks, which is a poem. That is to say that yr. defn. is a
poem, but as "maximally-expressive" and "sensually-rich" are not
maximally-expressive or sensually-rich, this poem of yours has broken its
own definition and is wandering somewhere, with its own porpoise.

For Faludy, poetry kept him alive in the work camps.
For many educators, poetry teaches rhetoric.
For some, unintentionally, poetry prevents a poetic revolution in thought;
the teaching of poetry badly can be used to prevent poetry.

Harold R wants to know what Beauty is, the dummy, but I got Big Things
to do today (and maybe the rest of 1998) so I can't fully say right now.
But here's where I start: there's mind and matter, inside and outside;
matter is what mind is conscious of, mind is what is conscious of
matter; a third property of the universe is affect--how the mind feels
about what it is conscious of--and that reduces to pleasure/pain,
good/bad.  If there's anything I've left out, lemme know.

As for Beauty, it is one form of pleasure--mostly sensual/sensory
pleasure but with complications.  I haven't straightened it all out, but
tend to break pleasure down to Beauty, the Moral Good (or
personal/social pleasure), Truth (conceptual pleasure) and Health (all
those pleasures having to do with merely surviving).

To get more detailed about Beauty, I conceive it as that which is
neither too familiar nor too unfamiliar (and I even mathematize it,
although the mathematization is not based on anything empirical).
What's too familiar or too unfamiliar varies with the person involved,
the context and all kinds of other problems but seems to me not that
hard to disentangle in any given case.  My primary example would be the
Beauty of a musical melody: the best ones jar at first, then become
wonderful, then become boring.  Yeah, it all sounds simple-minded and
maybe is.  But there is are for now while I go does my Big Things of the
day.

I truly appreciate Mark Weiss's personal statements on
Richard Elman.

Richard was a brilliant writer, with an ability to write
in many styles and forms. He was at his best, it seems to
me, in the wonderful novel TAR BEACH, which combines a
beautiful recreation of the past (the characters are atop
a synogogue for a summer tan) and an almost visionary sense
of new possibility, a sense of future which could be freed
from the apparatus of the past--whether it be love, hate or
just disappointment. His next book LOVE HANDLES in centered
on a character who is a complete failure, on one level, but
in his child-like innocence, has the potential to be (as is
truly) someone great.

In honor of Richard's memory, Sun & Moon will offer slightly
damaged copies of TAR BEACH at $3.00 each.

Richard was also a poet, and this comes strongly across in
this remarkable book.

A lot of great responses to this question.  And since I've been asked for my
own answer, here's the one I gave my friend: The purpose of poetry is to
create new pathways in the brain, to stimulate the synapses to keep our minds
flexible and our species adaptable.  Not that I think this answer is any
better than any of the others -- in fact I agree with all of them so far!
It's just the one I tell myself when guilt strikes me for spending time
writing instead of saving lepers or something.

Happy New Year.

I agree completely with Bobbie West's defense of poetry as something
that "create(s) new pathways in the brain, to stimulate the synapses to
keep our minds flexible and our species adaptable"--with the reservation
that this is a biological value of poetry, not its ultimate value, which
is to make us happy via words regardless of what it does for our
brains.  (And I would speak of "value" rather than "purpose" as I don't
believe there's such a thing as purpose, except in the everyday limited
sense of doing A to get B.)

Coming late to this thread but to mention Deleuze/Guattari in _What is
Philosophy?_ postulate that the purpose of art is to create new experience,
the purpose of philosophy to create new concepts, & of science to create new
functions. This newness would follow from need, usefulness, rather than from
a cliched fetishization of the new.

I remember Cage saying, but have been called on the citation-- "The purpose
of art is to add to the enjoyment of life."

I'm not entirely convinced of any of this but they're  some of the more
interesting ways of approaching this question I've encountered.

=46IVE POETS ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK TO SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC

Saturday, January 10, 7:30 p.m.

Charles Bernstein
Lisa Jarnot

=46rom Borscht Belt vaudeville to his embrace by the trendy theorists of
Paris, Charles Bernstein=B9s career has had more ups and downs than Jerry
Lewis.  But with undimming flash and generosity his poetry speaks with
greater force than ever, and it is always an event in our lives as
participants in culture to see him read, for his work, always intriguing,
at its best reaches the exhilarating glass-green rush and sublimity of
Niagara Falls.  He is the author of 20 books of poetry (including the
newest, _Republics of Reality: Poems 1975-1995_, from Sun & Moon), and two
influential books of essays: _A Poetics_ (Harvard University Press, 1992)
and _Content's Dream: Essays 1975-1984_ (Sun & Moon Press, 1986, 1994).
Bernstein is David Gray Professor of Poetry and Letters at the State
University of New York at Buffalo.

Lisa Jarnot=B9s first book _Some Other Kind of Mission_ (Burning Deck Press,
1996) made a big splash when it was hurled, like Olympic discus, into the
gentle pond of contemporary poetry.  Kerplunk!  Basho frog!  But clever
scouts, reading her work in fugitive pieces, and hearing her read aloud,
had already touted her as one of the finest young poets in America.  She is
the editor of the _Poetry Project Newsletter_, and a co-editor of _An
Anthology of New (American) Writing_, forthcoming from Talisman House in
early 1998.  Her work has been published in _Grand Street, Lingo_, and _The
World._  She=B9s here in San Francisco doing some important work on the life
and cosmos of our own Olympian, the late poet Robert Duncan.

Robert Fitterman
Kim Rosenfield

This is a special event that has long been on Small Press Traffic=B9s wish
list (along with, you know, a new computer and so forth).  People think of
Robert Fitterman as a kind of =B3Language=B2 poet, but he might just be the
ultimate heir to the great Objectivists instead, for his epic =B3Metropolis=
=B2
project marries the music, scope, and power of Zukofsky to the
historico-narrative-documentary of Charles Reznikoff.  Robert Fitterman is
the author of five books of poetry, recently including _Ameresque_ (Buck
Downs Books). The first book of his long poem, _Metropolis (1-15)_, is
forthcoming with Sun & Moon Press. He is the editor/publisher of _Object_
magazine and chapbooks. He is also the co-author, with Rodrigo Rey Rosa, of
the film script =B3What Sebastian Dreamt.=B2

Originally from Southern California, Kim Rosenfield comes to us from New
York where she writes some of the oddest and loveliest poems I know.  Her
concern for display and spectacle, her Baudrillardean, ecstatic sweep of
language and physicality, balance on the one hand urgency and drama and on
the other, the cold finish of stainless steel, the animatronics of Disney
and Brigitte Nielsen.  Rosenfield is the author of three chapbooks: _Some
Of Us_ (Ouija Madness Press), _Rx & Cool Clean Chemistry_ (Leave Books),
and _A Self-Guided Walk_ (Object/p o e t s c o o p). Her poetry has
appeared in several journals including _Black Bread, Chain, Big Allis,
Object, Mirage #4/Period(ical),_ and _Torque._ She is a clinical social
worker at New York University.

In conjunction with the San Francisco Art Institute

John Ashbery

We all think we know about John Ashbery, but the new 1998 version promises
more than a few surprises.  As we know he=B9s written sixteen books of
poetry, including _Some Trees, The Tennis Court Oath, Self-Portrait in a
Convex Mirror, Flow Chart,_ and the most recent, _Can You Hear, Bird_--as
well as a volume of art criticism, _Reported Sightings._  As we know he has
won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award and the
National Book Award; been named a Guggenheim Fellow and a MacArthur Fellow;
is a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.  We all know that he
hasn=B9t read here in San Francisco since 1990 and we=B9re happy to join the
Art Institute in sponsoring this reading.  But it=B9s what we _don=B9t_ know
that intrigues us and never more so than on the 26th, at which date and
time JA will preside over the mystic and ambiguous conjunction of Saturn
and Venus.

        Instead of worrying about the purpose of poetry, shouldn't we be
wondering whether there's any poetry in purpose? Why should poetry have to
defend itself to purpose, rather than the other way around? Poetry has
occasioned moments of amazement in my life; purpose has never meant me
anything but harm.

Hey! I've been gone for a week and my "lurking" status on this list has
been disrupted by being referred to as "a friend of Bobbie West" which
feels altogether strange, so here I am...coming out, if you will. I
hooked up with this list right about the time my professor insisted that
I write my own "poetics," which I anguished over until he changed the
question to "what are poets for?"...much easier to handle.

Your responses to the question were quite enjoyable; thank you.
Here's my bit:

Jerry had it right;
Technicians of the Sacred.

Poets are the real historians, as well as its opposite. As well as all
occupations in between. Like cartographer. Or a videographer of a
documentary about language as it time-travels.

What can "history books" tell about our existence? (not enough)

In another sentence, I could say that a poet is the choreographer of an
improvisational language, which implicates all participating words and
people in memory, history, and imagination.


>Thank you all for your valiant efforts to keep the list afloat. I guess >it's
>my turn to jump into the pool (blame it on Bromige: he told me to stop
>lurking).  Anyway, a  friend of mine recently posed the question, "What >is the
>purpose of poetry?" So how would you answer that?

>Bobbie West
>(testing her new de-lurking device)


Also: (completely unrelated)

How to guess the gender of Japanese first-names:

Male names often end in -hiko, -ro, -o, or a number, as in -ichi.
The first three name endings mean (basically) male, strong, a fine man,
etc.

Female names often end in -ko. Which means child.

A few names, like Kaoru or Sakae, are unisex.
The rest, you just have to know or ask.

i thought cage said the purpose of art "is to quiet divine influence and
make it susceptible to cheap bourbon."  but then i always misread.

yes, i like bobbie's def too; but i also find that once one gets used to a
certain "sound," feel, technique, etc., that purpose is less pronounced.
i've thus found it useful to explore other means of experience ("unusual"
physical movement as well as conventional "exercise", trying to draw,
singing) as well.

amiri baraka has a nice poem, a series of rhetorical questions if i recall,
about the "purpose" of poetry. one question is "do you have a mother?" etc
.  having only heard it once, and not read it, i don't have a reference
foryou.

Not being terribly original, I respond to Bobbie's question in a way much
like the majority of other posts....Poetry has reasons which are not
reasons but forms of immersion in praxis.  Or, to quote (more or less
accurately) two of the epigraphs given to recent issues of my magazine
Misc. Proj.:  "It is not the business of poetry to be anything" (Stephen
Rodefer) and "The function of poetry is to waste excess energy" (Rosemarie
Waldrop).

Some of the responses have been especially nice.  Like a number of other
people I like Mark Wallace's response and Bobbie's own formulation about
creating new neural pathways...

This being said, it occurs to me that folks on listservs about music (for
instance) almost never ask, What is the purpose of music? (Ditto painting,
theater, etc...) That it's fairly common for the question to arise among
poetry people has to do with social function and definition. (In our
culture, music is felt to be self-evident, poetry to be artificial and
needing justification..)

As with asking the question itself, so Bobbie's answer also presents
problems more interesting and fecund than its surface meaning...Seems to
me doing philosophy, engaging in education, experiencing music , dance,
sculpture, etc. all create new neural pathways.  (Admittedly, poetry's the
most interesting way to do so! but then I would think that, wouldn't I?)
So as before, the important level really is: why do we feel a need to
explicate poetry's function? Most similar human activities are felt to
exist as nodes of facticity..We do 'em because we do 'em.

Poetry is one of the most self-doubting of activities, in U.S. culture.
That's in some respects appalling.  But it also carries some positive
things...To quote one of the epigraphs under consideration for the next
issue of Misc. Proj.: "Doubt can move mountains.  Of all things certain,
doubt is the surest." (Brecht)

In any event, Bobbie's question strikes me as a great example of how
productive and useful questions can be, which don't have answers...

poetry is primordial, the stuff of sound and sense
it predates syntax, semantics
you might make haiku out of protolanguage
you might not
you might chant the body which is where the rhythm goes
the rhyme goes
what calls attention to the stuff of language or
its revolution, ability to surface
so that you're n o longer skimming prose
living in one or another of Faulkner's characters
who wants to anyway
nor are you putting quotation marks "" around "everything"
it's not the reification of language
but the stuff of the world that emerges
it's the vomit of the world
some poets like shelley see both sides at once
some poets like shelley see absolutely nothing
because it isn't sight
but those internal crags, beats of the heart
it's useless, poetry is, which is its strength, that is,
it rarely contributes to _meaning,_
it doesn't have to mean anything at all,
it's not anti-meaning either
it burrows into the body and through the ground
coming out in the desert maybe or the forest
where you used to be able to hear some sort of pounding
or scuttling in the underbrush
so that it's, you can can, the tcp/ip of language,
protocols ignoring the surface
but a tcp/ip that's quite inexact, as if there were no realms
or taxonomies, no definitive articulations
maybe the kenning or haiku again for that matter
stuffing language here and there so that it explodes,
implodes, stuff - there's also the matter of the breath,
it's been breathing, everyone knows that,
it returns as if language were once and for all something absolutely new
in the world, gesturing around the hill as Tran Duc Thao might say, where
the game is

The certainty of doubt is one of its weak points.
Doubt can move mountains - faith invents them (out of emerald molehills).

Mathematics.  Mathematics is not regarded as self-evident either, but as
artificial and needing justification.

What a misspent life I've led, on at least two counts.  Thank God for those
early piano lessons, at least those made sense.

Meikal--I'm sure this isn't what you mean, but with a Mac, Claris Home Page
does almost all the html for you, though you can still get into the code if
you want or need to. S.

One of the most famous (and therefore maligned--whether justly or not is a

is "first thought best thought"---
can anybody tell me WHEN that quote was first uttered. it has lost its
temporal "haulers", but some people need their citation references.
I wonder if it was before Dylan wrote "each is first an' none is best"--

you've probably seen this already, but the main page for the webring has a
link to instructions on how to join / i haven't joined myself, for one
because i'm not exactly clear on how i'd have to adapt my page with "ring
links", or if i'd even want to do that, and two because i haven't traveled
it enough to feel comfortable joining / if you find out more about it, or
eventually join, please let me know / or let me know in the meantime what
you think of the venture in general

best,
bill marsh

in the mode of replying,

MS Word 7.0 allows you to save in html, although i admit i haven't used
this feature too much / is that what you're thinking of? / i'm also
interested in finding ways of shortcutting the fiddling / "page" layout in
html is problematic for me and i'm wondering if there are programs out
there that do more of the work for me / i haven't looked at Frontpage 98
yet, but perhaps that helps with layout functions, like spacing, tabbing,
droplines, etc.

best,
bill

1) I belong to the webring.

2) Each site is supposed to have a link to the "joining" page and you can just
follow those.  The process is documented on the site.
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/2141/poetry/poetweb.html

3) I believe that NO poetry is purple italic, center justified, yet you will
find a lot of "stuff" like that on the ring.  However, the ring is very large,
and there are also many poetry organizations on it.

4) Yes, it does bring visitors to my site.

I don't have a citation, but as to when it was first uttered, I was always
under the impression that this was a dictum which Ginsberg picked up from
Kerouac.  Although, even if that's so, I wd guess there's not any Kerouac
citation to that effect.  Cd be wrong though.

i've started fiddling with this stuff more lately, and i think i've found
out that the current state of html does not really support formatted text
the way word processors do.  i think the difference is that word
processors and page layout tools operatie with the page in mind, rather
than a screen.  browser windows vary in size and shape too much for
fixed-format text to workvery well.

that said, almost all the major word processors will export to html, but
i've yet to see one that will take care of all the tabs, etc.  about the
best way to take care of the tabs is to set the font to either times or
courier (most of the time browsers are set to default to either of these
two) and insert spaces until the spacing is about right.  there's an html
tag you can use to specify which font a browser uses, assuming that the
reader has that font on their computer.

i just returned home in last night's ice with a fresh copy of adobe
pagemill, which is supposed to give better control over the formatting.
i'll know more after i work with it a while.

best,
eryque

           There is a new wordprocess, called Trellix, especially designed for
producing on-line documents.  Of course, it cannot handle any thing that html
isn't prepared to handled, but, so far,  I am impressed. It also supports
hypertext organization with an on-screen map.

            I have been  using a 30-day trial version (which can be downloaded
from www.trellix.com), but I think I will buy a copy.

            I believe that it is $99. Unfortunately, there is no Mac version.

Up here in Canada, the purpose of poetry is to get your name published, so
that the Canada Council will recognize you, and then you can get free air
travel to lots of wonderful places to do readings and so on.

I
guess
Im
wondering
if surfing
this ring is
something that
is interesting
ie can anyone
navigate thru a maze
of sites & find what
is interesting to them
whether experimental or
rhymed couplets?

is the webring a way for
sites to collaborate with each other?

is there a selection process with
the ring or is open to anyone?

is there topical ways to surf thru
a series of sites--such as the nature poem tour,
the apocalyptic tour, limerick tour, palindrome tour?

Im interested in linking spidertangle wordround, an online
workshop in hyperwriting, & Im looking to create ways to get alot
of interactivity & am also looking for involvement with writing of all
styles & all calibre.....

checked out their site, drooling from my macintosh screen, but then Ive
grown accustomed to the pc/mac veil & it seems that most things that
make sense in the end become cross platform, just us mac folk have to
pay more money & wait longer....

Im particularly interest to know if trellix or any other wordprocessor
supports the new dynamic html, which of course answers a lot of the
concerns of desktop publishers who are putting their documents on the
web.  where the layout is retained on the webpage despite browser &
monitor size....  I also feel like chances are pretty good that this is
what is needed for textuallizing the net, & would like to start creating
these documents now instead of waiting for netizens everywhere to be
upgraded....

SPD's new catalog says, and I quote:

"send your e-mail to orders@spdbooks.org"

Re the Ginsberg quote: I believe I first heard it in connection with Wichita
Vortex Sutra, which would place it in the late 1960s. It's certainly implicit
in Kerouac's Essentials of Spontaneous Prose, but of course JK never had a
complete thought exactly, so could never state this in so few words.

Well, I guess I should have said that *the first time I saw it in print*
was in *Improvised Poetics*.

I also took for granted that AG got it from Trungpa, the guru of Naropa,
and a Tibeten Rinpoche.

There is an attempt to index this webring in different ways.  There are almost
3,000 sites in the ring.  When I joined it was open to everyone.

There are at least three other general poetry webrings that I've heard about.
There are subsidiary webrings that have themes, styles, etc.  The Poetry
Webring ring is not put together according to a design or theme other than
poetry.  In other words, the code/link produces a random or next site.

    The slickest way to handle dhtml that I know of is Macromedia Dreamweaver.  It's
interface is something like Director (has a time line, etc.) and it integrates with
the Homesite editor.  Unlike some of the other Web editors, it doesn't limit you
access to the code, so you can switch to Homesite which is a powerful html editor...
Let's you muck directly with the code all you want, but takes care alot of the
bothersome stuff for you.
(The Mac version works with BBedit, I believe it is called).  It is on sale for $299
(including the editor).  And there is an academic version for about $140, for any
one who has an academic connection.  The demo is fully operational, but good for
only 30 days.

    While I am on the subject.  The Little Magazine is gearing up to do another
cd-rom.  We are looking for work that takes both writing and multimedia seriously.

Doesn't anyone find it a little disconcerting that a large percentage of the
sites accessed from such a ring may be no more than merely personal? Does
one want to promote one's community in such a context?

I believe Kerouac coined the phrase, once he hit upon his "spontaneous
prose" for the legendary first draft of On the Road.  But since his concept of
spontaneous prose derived from Neal Cassidy's letters, it's just as likely --
given the free sharing of ideas amongst the Ur-Beats -- that Kerouac picked up
the phrase from Ginsberg.  The best place to check for Ginsberg's first use of
"first thought best thought" would be his Notebooks of the '50's.  He might use
it in the City Lights "Howl" pamphlet.  But I'm almost certain he uses it in
Donald Allen's New American Poetry, which came out around 1960.

>>> George Thompson <thompson@JLC.NET> 01/05/98 01:36pm >>>
I think he used it for the first time in *Improvised Poetics*, from the
seventies, but I forget the exact date. I remember annoying Dianne Di
Prima, with whom I read it, when I commented that "last thought, best
thought" worked better for me.

bp Nichol began Book 4 of _The Martyrology' thus:

purpose is a porpoise

then dives into the seas of language for the rest of the poem (Book 4, of
course, but perhaps also all the other books he completed).

No short answer will do?

The poems make their own statements on this matter?

The matter is/becomes such statements?

All come to their own answers in just such a way?

well fer the hell of it I joined the spidertangle wordround hyperwriting
workshop into the webring.  in the ring queue Im between 2 pages that
have titles like "watercolor thoughts" & blue mood or something like
that, which for something like this particular site, where Im interested
in aspects of online writing & hypertext far more than quality of
writing, I think it'll work out ok.

but....
I was quite confounded when they sent me a list of catagories to choose
from for their topical navigators..... (I choose inner mind expression)
(ahem)



<Pick from this list a category:

Gothic
Romantic
Nonsense/Humor
Young Adult
Despair/Sorrow
Different Language
Inspirational
Group Site
Literature for Purchase
Rebellious
African/Native  American
Poet Studies/Profiles
LIFE'S UPS AND DOWNS
Inner Mind Expression/Philosophical
Political/civil unrest
Just Poetry/Prose
Zines/Contests
Gay/Alternate lifestyles



and...
I guess my question is can Miekal surf this ring & find sites unknown to
him that he will want to spend time at....I noticed jim andrews visual
poetry site in a list a head of spidertangle, so I suspect that since
there are 2100 sites Im bound to happen on something if I put an effort
into it....

No.  Really, web publishing is self publishing (or a recent outgrowth of it).

It is disconcerting that magazines are turning to it for their only public
outlet.

Free information is information with an agenda.  Personal sites' agendas are
obvious (and fairly innocuous).  This is one major reason I have no objection
to personal sites (hey, I have one).

<<Does one want to promote one's community in such a context?>>

I find a wacky tension in this question between personal, public, community,
and promotion.

Greeting card messages, song lyrics, and nursery rhymes are the models of most
web poetry. These models are the poetry that most people have -- a denominator
-- and you are seeing it on the web because the "audience" of the internet
pushes content (personal poetry) in response to content it pulls (perceived
poetry).

Perhaps a useful comparison is web = broadcast, where the controls influencing
audience membership are different from those of non-broadcast media.  What's
the most popular non-fiction broadcast?  The talk / call in show, which also
offers interaction / audience-defined content.

The webring poetry "community" if you call it that (it's just a bunch of
linked sites -- I certainly don't know the other people involved -- perhaps
"demographic" is a better term) is different from that of this list. I would
argue that all poetry on the internet contextualizes poetry on the internet,
and that it is naive to believe that there is a group that can select or
reject the purple-colored gothic font group.

        It is ironic that poets feel the need to define poetry, to defend
it.  I agree with your comments re purpose.  But I think the reason
we feel obligated to define and defend poetry is that poetry comes
from such an unusual place, at least in our time.  I write,
edit, and teach poetry and I find it interesting and irritating that
students who understand that to play music or to compose it must
involve study and learning ( the same goes for math, English,
history, art, ad nauseum) do not "get it" about poetry .

We have created a bizarre culture that says, "Because the poems I
write have arisen from such a deep place within me (a religious
experience, if you will), I accept no changes, no criticism."  So
poetry has become this fascinating and repulsive animal in many
instances -- an animal that feels but has very little, or no,
intellect.  Somehow, the joy in taking all those words and crafting
them into something elegant and beautiful, as a cabinetmaker would
his raw wood, has been relegated to the trash bin, at least in
the very public sector, i.e., open readings, Slams, etc.   If we lose
pleasure in technique, we are left with nothing but "clanging
cymbals."

Say you have a country which began as a counter-culture: plain Puritans
vs. ornate society, raw wilderness vs. refined civilization.  You
might eventuate in near-diametrically opposed positions on what
technique should be, since technique is predicated on the result
you're aiming for.  Never mind that the diametrically-opposed
positions are dogmatic cartoons of what a longtime devotion to making
poems might mean.

There's a strange Moebius strip situation in place, in which (1) a certain
art form (poetry) demands & deserves disciplined (even academic!)
absorption; (2) nevertheless the merely academic expressions of any
art form are a sort of whittled-down closed circle, a caricature of
the form's true possibilities; and (3) there being no "place" in
the cultural economy for poetry as there is for prose, painting or
music, the academy is the fall-back position. (You there, Villon?
Rabelais?)

But hey, poetry's gotta work out its own problems (the play's the thing).
Maybe this ain't a real dilemma (maybe it's just more boring Henryak-yak,
O List!).  But whatever is happening on that Moebius strip - formalism,
experiment, napping-on-laurels, and (mostly) teaching - it only has a
faint echo, it seems, in "culture at large" - the publishing pyramid
& the fame game & the slam hams & the INTERNET... hey.

I think MFA programs should incorporate general lit studies along with
a requirement to interact on a creative performance level with the
town-beyond-gown world.  Call it the poetry greenhouse project or
something.  It's a mule-drivin' world, you fey MFA's!  Giddy-up!
Plus the tenure track should start in 4th grade elementary!

Why general lit studies, Henry? Why not something in particular? I'm tired
of generality in poetry. If there's a problem with the students being
homogenized, then let them choose what they want to do, but push them out
of generality.

Yessir, I've been in bookstores, I've seen what they do there. You get all
these categories of writing, like "Cars" and "SF" and "Womens Studies" and
"Gardening" and "Fiction" and "Eastern Religions" and "History" and on and
on and on, and then you get "Poetry".

In fact, "Poetry" should have the same sections as the others (its own
"Cars" and "SF" and "Eastern Religons" and "History" sections, or whatever
is deemed appropriate, "Langpo, Boredpo, Navelpo, Sir!:realpo!, or
whatever", or it could be shelved with the others. Some of the best poetry
I have was pulled from the "Novels" stacks in bookstores in Germany.
Interesting, that this house-sharing goes hand-in-hand with a lot of
experimentation with form, a lot of commerce between poetry and prose.

As for a creative performance level, isn't that, in part, advertising? I
mean, leaving aside the political/economic distress of advertising, just
the form of it? Isn't that in part HTML? Animation? Sound? Isn't that in
part painting things on walls? I don't mean to limit it to that, because I
don't know what you had in mind. But, let's get beyond creative performance
and say: doing stuff in the world, using the world as a page, not just a
handful of literary traditions.

You're right: performance. As in: even reading is a performance, even
writing. Otherwise the stuff is learned by rote, which is to say: not
learned.

>>Call it the poetry greenhouse project or something.<<

You mean like: forced tulips and those big white lilies you get at Easter,
and butter lettuce and tomatoes and cucumbers sealed in really long 20 mil
condoms, and flats full of purple-leaved marigolds in the spring 'cause
there ain't no nutrients in that darn peat/perlite mix?

>>It's a mule-drivin' world, you fey MFA's!  Giddy-up!

Yes, let's stomp. You want to give some idea of the curriculum for this 4th
Grade tenure? I'd like to hear it. Really. What do you have in mind? You're
onto something here.

>>[--okay, we'll do whatever you say, Henry. We'll call it the National
Henry-in-the-Schools Program, or Hee-Haw for short.]<<

Who's paying?

I assume we could solve that peat/perlite problem with mule manure.

Thank you, Harold, for dashing in where angels fear to tread & responding in
a friendly way to yet another Henry slosh of excess blab.  I need a
teaching job, folks - get me one & I'll let the list rest. Come back,
multifarious poetics list!  No one writes to the colonel.

Now to your questions.  Yes, "creative performance" was enough to shut down
every self-respecting synapse out there.  But I like greenhouses.  I WAS
thinking of a "forced growth" situation.  Like, not virtual reality or
literary elephant hunting snobbism ("Serious sport has nothing to do with
fair play.  It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, and
disregard of all the rules." - George Orwell), i.e. the name-glue game.
Instead: a course requirement for an MFA degree would be to design either
1) your own physical reading/performance in a public venue of your own
devising, off-campus (subject to a tough-grading prof), or 2) an elementary
or high school reading/teaching project. Group projects would be allowed.
What this would encourage would be a steady stream of experimental situations
and encounters not tied to the usual hierarchies of finesse.
Another requirement would be the misnomered "general lit", & what I meant
was what I suppose most MFA degress require, some non-WRITING courses:
some immersion in the literary background & scholarship.

Once again Henry leaps in ignorance to the fore - correct me, MFA team!

Now as to tenure track from 4th grade: this was simply a very obscure way
of saying the feedback loop from study to public performance should
stretch down to the youngsters.  I'm talking about solidifying a "place"
for poetry, like the one music, art, prose, & drama have, in the larger
culture, by a greenhouse process of grafting MFA work more directly into
the outside world.

How horrible this must sound to you stretched grad students who only want
a breathing space from DEMANDS like this in order to WRITE for a year or
two.  & I don't know what the answer is there.  Can you help out here,
Blarnes?  No.  Blarnes is snuffling into his tweed, sound asleep beside
a horizontal cup of Old Skidoo.

& to tell the truth, it's all in vain.  For in one resounding "CHONGGGGG"
the Lord smoteth ye social engineers atoppeth each his pate & ye social
engineers were therein in their middest henceforth summoned to read unto
themselves in the original Italian Giambattista Vico & to weep salt tears
for ye blind & philistine arrogance.  Yea, like unto Goliath were they
every one, yet Dave the little Poet from San Jose sling-shotteth each
every-eth one with his newfoundeth stanza, the Dave Stave - & it was
a stunner unto to behold.

        It has been my fantasy of many years  that the poets are (or should be)
writing a new encyclopedia for which _Moby Dick_ (a poem, of course) is the
entry on whales, and it is the task to provide comparable takes on everything
else  A to Z.

        Henry Gould is right on track here:

    If poets would take the responsibility for _ knowing_ something (not the
generality "Gardening" but put growing herbs or roses; not  "History" but the
Whisky Rebellion or the settlement of Santa Fe), we woulnd't have these dreary
discussions of the purpose of poetry.

        After, say, Milton or there abouts, poetry got recast as a formal
activity, but the alphabet is a very slushy formal medium, and mathematics
emerged as the discipline of formal creativity. Poetry became overwhelmingly a
medium for expressing private sentiment (see the Poetry Webring as evidence).

         The web makes a collaborative encyclopedia altogether feasible. The
nearest thing I know is the Cybernetica Project
(http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/DEFAULT.html). (The Project, of course, profits from
over three centuries of stunning mathematics and logic.)

Harold Rhenisch, not Henry Gould, deserves credit for Don Byrd's quotes.
I think humanists like Vico, & people like Peirce & Dewey, could go a
long way toward recasting poetry as a form of reflexive knowledge, in
a way that somebody could integrate into a writing curriculum.  I point
in that direction in some essays about to come out in Mudlark.

But I'd have to disagree that the alphabet is a slushy medium for formal
creativity.  Milton didn't recast anything but was simply one of the
late practitioners of the pretty much lost art of "numbers", or
numerical symbolism in verse - these "numbers" in Milton & Spenser
are an elegant grid for the most intricate & refined creative
amalgams & syntheses of feeling & information.  Anyone for example who
has read Omry Ronen's long book about only 2 of Mandelstam's fairly
short odes (_An Approach to Mandelstam_), in which he goes in depth
into the Russian tradition of these same techniques (carried much further
toward the present) - showing how a single word or short phrase fans out
into dozens of meaning-layers - will know what I mean. (Although Mandelstam
DID say poets should "envy crystallography"!)  These things weren't lost
on the moderns but got jolted into discontinuity, stress & ambiguity.

For the Moby Dick Encyclopedia I'd like to do the entry on
"Harmonicas - How to Break Them In By Holding them Out the Car
Window While Driving With Your Other Hand".  That's all I know much about
and I'll do it in the form of a flat-pickin' epic.

    To be sure, the alphabet generates infinite strings of meaning (Ronen's
book could have gone on indefinitely), but the "layers" are vague analogies and
there is no necessity in that visualization.  Alphabetic writing is formally
quite primitive compared, say, to topology.

            Now, harmonicas.  There is a worthy theme.  I have been thinking of
writing about vacuum tubes and the pre-solid state days of electronics.

            Hope, I deleted the right "xxx wrote:" this time.

Well, even Mandelstam my hero might have agreed with you.  But the details
which accumulate in a map might be likened to the sounds & meanings which
accumulate (as in an energy generator of some kind) inside these simple

I teach at a tiny private high school in San Diego--and am in the
process of trying to talk my way into teaching a poetry class. I have a
few ideas of my own, but I'd love some input on what kinds of poems (and
teaching techniques) I might use to induce some excitement about the
subject when dealing with teenagers, many of whom are serious TV
addicts. Anyone have experience with this?

       Of course, I chose poetry rather than topology to work in but formal
precision is not its strength. If Mandelstam "envied crystallography," poetry is
nearer meteorology or alchemy. Oral poetry is potentially of more formal interest:
compare one of Jackson Mac Low's randomly generated texts to one of his singular
performances, for example. Digital media offers poetry an immense formal advantage.

        The knowledge of the blues harp--this is real culture--and worthy of our
most serious attention.  Sadly, most of what remains known about great American
music has been academized, like poetry, and is now purveyed by places like the
Berklee School of Music, where people learn all of the chops, missing only the music
(which of course can only be supplied by the life of a community).

This is unbelievable - at least for anyone who loves _ma,_ space, and the
deliberate manifestation of Zen in all forms of Japanese life.

Fukuoka hosted the first National Tea Ceremony Races yesterday; there
were 45 contestants from 31 prefectures. The winner, Ichiro Azato, com-
pleted the full ceremony in 16 seconds, including bringing the matcha
(ritual tea) to the required 2 centimeters of froth.

It was amazing; there was considerable "chanting" as well, but I have no
idea what it meant. And it was incredible, watching Azato's right hand
grasp the bamboo whisk, entering the tea with a "perfect frenzy" as far as
I could tell.

For those who don't know, the usual ceremony can last up to three hours.

The contest was held on the grounds of the Hakozaki Shrine - We walked up
an hour early, and joined the crowd of 1000 or so. There were bleachers!
(Later we found that it was broadcast LIVE on NHK Channel 6.)

I couldn't agree more.  I learned most of what I know about poetry from
playing the harmonica, the most basic lesson of which is: tone is everything,
& don't overplay your notes.  (Sometimes I forget not to grandstand.
& I'll never play like the greats.  "And the sound of the little
typewriter sonatina / Is only a shadow of those great sonatas." (Mandelstam,

another harmonica lesson: great organ sounds doth come from itty-bitty
instruments.  Hear that, guys & gals?  & remember: Wallace Stevens, or
Big Daddy as he was known in Hartford blues joints, almost called
his collected poems THE WHOLE OF HARMONICA. [ain't that right, Blarnes?]

henry, i thought a lot of blues performance was *about* grandstanding,
about struttin yr stuff and showing that your the baddest one around.  A
couple months ago i saw big time sarah in chicago perform "hoochie coochie
(wo)man" and i'll be damned if she  wasn't grandstanding when she got a
young man sitting by the stage on his knees in front of her while she
mimicked a few sex acts.

RE: teaching high school TV watchin' kids

I taught for a few years at a mid-sized state university and find the TV
thing just as common there.  Your post doesn't suggest how you feel about TV
as something students might write about.  Possibly this could be discussed as
a class-- what does the modern poet write about?  How can he/she avoid the
media if they were so inclined? Is TV a "better" medium than poetry for
getting across what they want to get across?  How are attitudes about poetry
and TV similar/disimilar?  Oddly, most of my students, though they knew a lot
about TV, thought that the medium was "stupid" and a "waste of time" and did
not want to write poetry about TV.  So, of course, I made them do it.

Maybe work back and forth between the mediums-- write poetry about different
things in TV, then write TV sitcoms about poems (possibly an interesting way
for them to interpret poems).  I recall vaguely a book of sestinas (I think)
about "Perry Mason"--poet's last name is Cummins (I may be way off)  I,
myself, have written a series of poem based on "Night Gallery."  And, of
course, "Gunslinger" is very cool.

Yes. Closer to these ( most especially alchemy).

Speaking of alchemy, if you are going to write about the pre-solid state days
of electronics, be sure to include the magic of the so-called crystal radio.
This essentially primitive and simple radio receiver requires no power supply
and yet is able to (weakly) pull AM band electromagnetic waves out of the air
as it were. The key to this is a raw crystal of germanium (I think called
"galena" a long time back), which is probed at, or picked, with a sharp pin (or
something like that) until you get a signal. Interestingly enough, the
circuit's ground is referred to as "earth" ground as it is attached to a stake
or a pipe that goes to the soil.

_Gunslinger_ for high school students?  _Private_ high schoool students?
Good luck.  Stein and Seuss sounds like a fruitful conjunction to me, but
again I worry (based on my own experience teaching "Writing About Poetry"
to Stanford freshpersons) that the obtuseness of Stein or Dorn might be
off-putting to considerably sheltered and privileged young adults who more
than likely have been indoctrinated with ideals of success, rationality,
and pragmatic communication.  I've found that these kinds of students tend
to want order, sense, and meaning in poetry, and that absurdity pisses them
off (even in controlled doses such as in, say, Stevens' "Emperor of Ice
Cream").  I worked hard over two quarters trying to get across the idea
that language can do other things than relay factual or didactic
information, with only limited success.

In a situation like that, I think that canonical texts--Shakespeare, Pope,
Frost, etc.--really do make good primers for introducing students to the
building blocks of poetry, even if your aim is later to knock those blocks
down and show how language can perform radical acts of disruption, blah
blah blah.  More to the point, I think it may be more persuasive to show
that those texts can be as disruptive, in their apparent sane docility, as
poems by Stein, et al., than to hit students over the head immediately with
jagged-edged chunks of "resistant" discourse.

That said, I offer these not-very-sexy suggestions for some introductory
poems: Shakespeare's Sonnet 73 ("That time of year thou may'st in me
behold") provides a great bundling of formal patterns and rhetorical
strategies for students to unpack, and the strangeness of the early modern
English is just manageable enough to get them to read closely while still
promising successful deciphering (you have to make good on the offer of the
cookie at the end of the chore, at least at first).  Similarly, lyrics by
Blake, Yeats, Dickinson, and the like are simultaneously short and
compacted enough to generate some rudimentary lynx-eyed analysis without
exhausting readers.  After some confidence manifests itself, try something
a little bulkier and less polite, like "Song of Myself," that seems to
approach everyday language's random structure but really still contains
tons of rhetorical order--let them wade through that and begin to see the
conventions that lurk in even seemingly informal styles of discourse (but
you probably shouldn't call it that).  If they make it this far, it can't
hurt to see what they do with more byzantine modernist, objectivist, beat,
or even language poems.  In small doses, however--you don't want a mutiny
on your hands.  Or do you?

Cheers,

Kasey

well, if you can get away with it, ok.  we are getting into the deep
complexities of performancologistics here, clearly.  My favorite harp
player (actually I have a few) is Sonny Terry, a blind man who played
harp upside down & has a very subtle manner & tone, while remaining
up country & very green. He's like the Andrew Marvell of blues, if you
will. - Henry

Uh, David Trinidad aside (like him, like his work), I don't really see much
benefit here.

Maybe mention that sitcom writing is a valid career path for those without the
chops to do the artist thing or for artists who need fast cash.  You need to
know a lot about STORY, STRUCTURE, CHARACTER, and CONTINUITY.  You need to be
able to write.  Many sitcom writers are frustrated, but very real, poets.

Stupid time-wasting things friends of mine in bands were encouraged to do
rather than write poetry: turn poems into song lyrics, set poems to music,
write song lyrics rather than poems, etc.  Are they still in a band?  No.  Can
they write poetry?  No.  Same goes for writing poems about tv.  In general,
who cares?

If you're going to teach poetry, teach regular poetry.  What does student tv-
watching add to the process?  Exposure to another medium, one that is very
style conscious (generally, students will have a good sense of genre and style
as it changes message).

The poet maudit tradition is always very popular.  And symbolism is easy to
learn.

how are you using the term "regular poetry"?  Those sitcom writers,
frustrated poets that they are, would, I suspect, write regular poetry.

As for the value of techniques and exercises, lots and lots of kids don't
have what it takes for sitcom writing (not maybe as easy as it might seem),
songwriting, or poetry.  To suggest that the techniques used to introduce
them to these arts as the reason for this doesn't seem quite right.  Heck,
even teaching "regular" poetry, how many high school level/undergraduate
poetry students continue writing it?

Isn't Gunslinger a regular poem?  Or the Cummins (again, hope I have the name
right) series on Perry Mason?

well, i don't really expect any high-school teachers to get such a book
past their department head or school board (though my only real misgiving
about teaching this to highschool students is that the talking horse rolls
a joint about every two pages).  but i do think that this book is much
more accessible and _fun_ as an epic poem than, say, homer's works, and i
think there's still more than enough there to use it to study epic poetry.

i think "all things in moderation" might be the best thing to have in
mind here.  i remember dreading the poetry units of high school english
classes precisely because i knew it was going to be the same old canonical
stuff we'd read since sixth or seventh grade.  i found formal poetry by
long dead europeans uninteresting, disconnected from anything i could
relate to.

I find that using the same method when reading the book adds considerably
to its enjoyment, although, like a concert, it is still good fun straight.

perhaps point out all the word-play in tv ads (i wanted a *bud* light, for
ex) and then show them word-play in poetry / do lots of experiments and
exercises with pun, anagram, palindrome, charade, rebus, etc. to show how
poetry begins with language / the lyrics of Beck and R.E.M. are rich with
"stretched-sense" and might provide a good starting point for teaching risk

Miekal and Bill,
     I've been using Hotmetal and trellix which are fairly cheap and

PAPER PROPOSALS: Following upon the panel, "Charles Olson and
Subjectivity," presented at last year’s American Literature Association,
Baltimore (May 1997), I seek proposals for papers on related themes.
This year again, the Charles Olson Society will sponsor a session at the
ALA annual conference (May 28-31) in San Diego. Last year’s panel
explored the reception of Olson’s poetics by women, interrogating
constructions of gender and sexuality in his work while seeking to
evaluate the contemporary relevance of his poetics. For this year’s
session, I hope to find proposals that measure Olson’s poetics (or his
practice) against ethnic and postcolonial critiques of the ways in which
mainstream cultural productions suppress or reify the "other." Proposals
for papers concerning gender, sexuality, and language are also welcome.
The session is open both to studies that historicize Olson’s
contributions to post World War II poetics and to studies that question
the relevance of Olson’s poetics to current practice.

Please contact me by return e-mail no later than Jan. 22, 1998 or write

literally, cursed poet. you know, the poet as outlaw, criminal, addict,
suicide, deranged and unappreciated visionary, mendicant prophet, etc;;;
coleridge, baudelaire, rimbaud, jim morrison, bob kaufman, francois villon.
v popular among adolescent boys.  i wanted to write a piece called "cool
maudit" about stephen jonas, and still might, though the reference to cool
moe dee will be obsolete by the time i ever get around to it.

paul beatty is a poet who uses a  lot of tv references in his work. i'm not
that familiar w/ tv, so i don't know how fast references become obsolete.
still, some kids might enjoy his stuff. also, wnyc-tv had some "poetry
spots" that are available at no cost (i believe) to teachers...bob holman
might have more info. i've got a tape w/ 3 of them --beatty, tracie morris,
and walter lew --and they're just terrific.-md

whoa there pardner. i've had success teaching stein etc; the trick is to
tell students right up front that it's *spozed* to be playful and
nonsensical and their job is to get with that program, not to decode for
some secret deep meaning.  although i also do a lot of decoding with/for
them, cuz i do think stein is a lot about puns. also we do a lot of reading
aloud w/ stein, and talk about "non-normative" or "non-narrative" writing.
just give 'em the context and watch 'em go.  you could, tho, challeng what
i mean by "success" in this context. if a few students get it, and get
excited, that's good enough for me.  mostly i just enjoy teaching stein so
much that i think my enthusiasm may blind me to whether i'm "getting
across."

Robert Duncan would have been 79 today. So I read the "new" interview with him
in the new Chicago Review (lots of good stuff in that issue, including pieces
by Alan Golding, Jed Rasula, Anne Carson, Amiri Baraka and Keith Tuma).

Impossible to imagine what the owl-eyed master of rime would have been like on
something like the Poetics List. But we can be certain it woulda been
something else,

i admit feeling more interested in and exciting by what tom touches on here
-- a word-of-mouth (word-of-web?) ring linking liked and like-minded sites
/ my URL is now available below, and i'll repeat my call from my
promotional post of a few days ago: any who'd be interested in
collaborating (linking pages would be the first and easiest kind of collab
i'd be interested in), please let me know backchannel or to the list, as

From:         Henry Gould <AP201070@BROWNVM.BROWN.EDU>
Subject:      reading in Providence

I just returned from the tiny Transit Bookshop in the Fox Point neighborhood of
 town, where in an even tinier adjacent sitting room, Edwin Honig read to an
audience of about 25-30.  He was in good form, despite having just come out of
the hospital after acute asthma troubles (he is 77).

Good form is an understatement; he read mostly new poems which were excellent.
Honig could read the phone book, or even perhaps some of my long postings to
this list, & make them sound interesting; but he's a genuine lyric poet, whose
long, intricate, dense-yet-light, Jamesian sentences compress and amalgamate
very high-pitched emotion - laughter, desire, love, grief - very much on the
edge and the surface - with a mind full of irony and humor - and an
incredibly profuse expressive vocabulary of direct description.

I know this doesn't really tell you much.  I told myself I should have taped it
- & somebody has to get him to give more readings & do so.  I've recorded
him before, but he has new poems & this was the perfect milieu, I could have
kicked myself for leaving the tape recorder at home.  The 1st thing he said
after finishing was, "I read somewhere that science can retrieve voices -
what's been said - from anytime in history."  People laughed & somebody
said "you've been reading science fiction."  But I think he knows how good
he is, & how strange it felt for all of us in this little room to
hear the poems drift off into silence.

How to describe it.  A large old man, with a large, leonine head, oversize
upper body sort of stumbling over an aging pair of legs; his poems imitating
his gait, like an elephant dancing; a narrow range but within his meditative
vehemence a sense of perfection - this is a rare artist doing what he knows
he can do.  An incredibly rich diction & descriptive eye,
a mind always dwelling on the tragic/grief-stricken/desiring/ridiculous
human predicaments.  A very powerful intelligence spinning out these
playful extensions into syntax, observation & complete & theatrical
existential uncertainty. Honig won't give you any answers; the questions are
always hovering there, looming ghosts - but in the presence of those ghosts
he lopes into the poem's arena which is an encounter with what's
in front of him & with what the sentences & rhymes are doing - and then he
"thinks out loud" THROUGH this encounter, this experience, into a kind of
witty or resigned resolution. Does that help? With a Shakespearean/Brooklyn
diction by means of which the words take on a dancing quality, a sad-happy
elephant dance. Sorry I can't be more precise.

Al & Mary Cook were in the audience; David Shrayer-Petrov, the Russian poet;
Tom Epstein, slavicist, Russian translator & editor of ALEA; Susan Brown,
Honig's long-time collaborator on Pessoa translations; my 16-yr old son,
who said he enjoyed it (& that's a compliment).  It's a very cute little
bookstore on the edge of survival with low-cost paperbacks & curious lore.

Thanks to everyone who gave me input & ideas. The glory of the school
where I work is that it's absolutely tiny (about 50 students), and not
all that conservative. Once I get permission to teach the class, I
suspect I'll have quite a lot of freedom to do what I will. One of my
goals is to help students understand the relevance of poetry, or even if
they could just begin to see the infinite and amazing capacities of
language, I'd be pleased. I didn't necessarily mean to involve tv
itself, but since it's something that they seem to think is an important
part of their lives, it might be good to challenge that and make them
decide what's special about it. I also like the pop songs/poetry
connection, and I love the thought of Stein & Seuss. I imagine that the
responses will vary among the students, so I'd want to take things from
as many different angles as I have time for. I think I'd like to present
poetry as a real, living part of our culture, society, etc, and try to
undo the perception that it exists only within and for the small subset
of people who are holed up in their rooms seeking some deeper meaning to
life...or that it is just some boring strange segment of their lit books
where they study alliteration, assonance, and rhyme.
        Thanks for your help...I'll let you know when it finally happens!

Good luck.  Stein and Seuss sounds like a fruitful conjunction to me, but
again I worry (based on my own experience teaching "Writing About Poetry"
to Stanford freshpersons) that the obtuseness of Stein or Dorn might be
off-putting to considerably sheltered and privileged young adults who more
than likely have been indoctrinated with ideals of success, rationality,
and pragmatic communication.  I've found that these kinds of students tend
to want order, sense, and meaning in poetry, and that absurdity pisses them
off (even in controlled doses such as in, say, Stevens' "Emperor of Ice
Cream").  I worked hard over two quarters trying to get across the idea
that language can do other things than relay factual or didactic
information, with only limited success.

"In a situation like that, I think that canonical texts--Shakespeare, Pope,
Frost, etc.--really do make good primers for introducing students to the
building blocks of poetry, even if your aim is later to knock those blocks
down and show how language can perform radical acts of disruption, blah
blah blah.  More to the point, I think it may be more persuasive to show
that those texts can be as disruptive, in their apparent sane docility, as
poems by Stein, et al., than to hit students over the head immediately with
jagged-edged chunks of "resistant" discourse."

I have two boys who don't turn six until next week who've had no trouble
wading through the first 60 pages of Finnegan's Wake, every word. Obtuseness
or difficulty or whatever is really a learned condition. As Kit Robinson
once observed, the only people who ever found language poetry "difficult"
were English majors at the college level. I think Dorn's use of the rhetoric
of the comic would work well at least with the boys in the class.

I've taught Stein to Freshman the last two years with a fair amount of
sucess, parts of Tender Buttons, the Portrait of Picasso - I start by
playing them Stein's reading of "P of P" which is beautiful and rhythmic
and helps them to understand the humor of the thing - there's a real
pleasure to hearing it, reading it, as I suspect there was to writing it
and my kids got that.  I also asked them to imagine it formally before
seeing how Stein laid it out on the page, which was an innocuous way to
begin talking about the relativity of form versus its necessity.  Then
there's just pointing to things they're familiar with: eg that "please
pale hot, please cover rose" is a kind of homophonic translation of "peas
porridge hot, peas porridge cold" and that it occurs in the section called
"Food," a kind of cleverness which they tend to appreciate and which makes
them want to look harder, and you can start talking about how we're
socialized by language games such as nursery rhymes, something they all
tend to understand since the poor sonsabitches grew up reciting things
like "the little engine that could."  Of course there'll always be a few
people who think its bullshit but that's the breaks.   -m.

Will try to improve BRIEFLY on tired flaccid report on Honig reading.

Transit Bookshop is in Fox Point, old Portuguese waterfront neighborhood
which lingers on despite seemingly permanent crippling by I-95 freeway
built directly across the wharf area.  Honig has long affinity with
Portugal based on translations of F. Pessoa (for which he was knighted
by Portuguese gov't).  Transit, as in Transit St., named after Ben Franklin
visited Providence & made astronomical observations of transit of Venus
there.

One reason Honig is perhaps little-known in this period, besides living
in provincial town, being old & retired from teaching, etc., is that his
poetry offers few exterior props.  There are no obvious stylistic trappings,
no "scheme", no sentiment, no overt philosophy.  There is love, hope, memory,
fear, wonder - but any certainty or idealism is dissolved in irony &
humor.  Honig is an expressionist, existentialist (I can't
think of a better word), word-painter; his talent for sharp observation
curiously reminds me of Emily Dickinson - there is a drawing on
deep wells of renaissance & metaphysical vocabulary without hint of
archaism or traditionalism.

Here is one of his more abstract or formulaic poems (the only one I have
handy).  Imagine it being read, say, by a WC Fields crossed with Wallace
Stevens.

LYING ON THE HALF-TRUTH

No one at the station
meets no one one the train.
Train starts up again,
takes away the station.

new-opening

sliding by with
all its own
maybe-now-
when-of-it

chafing thought
squelched by
asking
then-and-there

Did it ever happen?
Was I in it?
How was it to be that
where-and-when now?

hmmm --  R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion" has long been a point of
fascination --

  that's me in the corner
  that's me in the spotlight losing my religion . . .

& what music;

when (mid-'60s) I was abt. 10-11 years old (at our So.Calif. Quaker
school), we sat around on the lawn and read thru mimeos of Simon &
Garfunkel lyrics, by way of poetry study.

I'd vote for David Byrne's sharp-ambiguous lyrics as another
candidate (esp. note the album (ECM label) of his collaboration w/
Robert Wilson, KNEE PLAYS (I think is the title) -- since, for one
thing, those are all spoken rather than sung; -- & good stuff too) --

for that matter, blues lyrics could be a route of intro-to-po-study?

amazing.  Okakura rolling in his grave (as it were)?  BTW, maybe a
year or so ago, there opened in DC a likable establishment known as
TEAISM (right next to a Starbuck's, on R Street NW, near Connecticut
-- at the start of the couple blocks of R Street that have long been
established as the genteel art-gallery-ghetto of this city.  Place
boasts quite an assortment of black, green & white teas as well as
pan-Asian cuisine.  (The "ism" lends the right dose of theory veneer
to the place-concept, presumably.)

> Alan - there are times I _really_ have culture shock here!

Speaking of this -- just finished reading William Gibson's enjoyable
latst novel, IDORU (published late 1996), most of which takes place
either in cyberspace or a mid-21st century Tokyo.  Lotta fine
Gibsonian extrapolation goin' on; uncle david gives it five stars.

Not, I think, to give too much away, the Idoru ("idol") proves to be
an artificial-intelligence construct & pop star . . .  -- for any who
read it, a thought: the character Laney's notion of "nodes" reminds,
if vaguely, of what Jung called constellation [as transitive verb]
of archetypes -- though the comparision is a bit problematical --

Record yourself in your own tv show. In the course of this "show," which =
should ideally involve car crashes & lust triangles, insert some of your =

I was struck by Michael Macgee's point about playing Stein for students.
I've never taught, nor even been very close to doing so, in any formal
sense.  But I really do think that Michael's experience with the Portrait
of Picasso is an excellent signpost for how to put good poetry across to
people.  This may (like many a bias I have) derive from my highly
formative early training in music.  But good (even, just
interesting) readers can have a huge impact.  Stein is one of the great
examples, for all the apparent dryness of her approach when you first hear
it.  I believe that (in very different ways: one dry yet musical, the
other floridly musical, in a way that is so peculiar it takes some getting
used to) Oppen and Pound are two who can become much more accessible to
people if they hear the available tapes.  Oppen is my personal favorite,
and in my opinion about the best reader I've ever heard.  The two-cassette
Pound set has been, for me personally, a remarkably functional tool for
thinking through issues about his technique and impact (and listening to
it is a fairly astonishing experience in and of itself).  One other thing
occurs to me (quite relevant, in our rock & roll culture). Both these sets
of recordings, made in what could be called old age (and that's audible),
are remarkable demonstrations of the power and intensity of elders.

Yeah, but if you go with early R.E.M., then you get really
"stretched-sense" lyrics:

HARBORCOAT

They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off
A handshake is worthy if it's all that you've got
Metal shivs on wood push through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads "REACT"

They shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
Reddened their necks, collared their clothes
Then we danced the dance till the menace got out
She gathered the corners and called it her gown

Please find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it
Find my harborcoat, can't go outside without it

[etc.]

Which leaves out two things that make the text even more interesting:
first, Stipe's habit of not speaking the words clearly in order to allow
multiple meanings (Is it "Metal shoes on wood, pushed through our backs"?
Stipe wants your ears to guide you to the meaning that works best for
you.); and second, that there is a second lyric being sung at the same time
during all but the first verse.

It is no accident that two of the FAQ maintainers for rec.music.rem are
also big fans of this disjunctive poetry stuff...

I think my all time favorite book for getting highschool kids excited
about what language can do is Bob Cobbing's book Bill Jujube.  (I dont
have the book in front of me, spelling may be wrongish).  It is a book
of short syllable concatentations that are word music in every way.
These texts work well for have a class read them outloud together, in
rounds, as fast as they can, with different voices, essentially
performing thru their fears.  I find that is you give context & meaning
a break, the one's in the class that are more uncertain get a chance to
trust their own voice, their own writing & then by extention seek to
understand other writing.

altho I have to admit that the thot of 6 year old reading finnegan's
wake makes far more sense then the texts 6 years olds are normally
"forced" to read.

For sheer linguistic richness and metaphysical joyriding (with a healthy
dose of decapitation imagery, make of that what you will), I cast my vote
for the twin John Donnes of pop, They Might Be Giants.  I used their
"Shoehorn with Teeth" along with Robert Johnson and The Beastie Boys for a
one-day song-lyric session in my Writing About Poetry course, and got some
relatively lively responses.  Lively, that is, for students who uniformly
cringed at Williams' "Danse Russe," whimpering about its "perversion," and
who stared at Ashbery's "Farm Implements and Rutabagas in a Landscape" as
though I had set a dog turd on the desk.

Back on track, They Might Be Giants are full of logical paradoxes,
wordplay, and cultural (literary, political, historical, etc.) allusions,
and their ostensibly light-hearted music provides a good backdrop for
discussions of tonal irony.  Like Beck, REM, and David Byrne, they combine
an uncommonly articulate sensibility with a capacity for reshaping trash
into thought-fodder.  You gots to check it out.

Well, _duh_.  They've probably been hearing their dad's poetry since they
were zygotes, and Joyce must sound like Richard Scarry by comparison.

You would think so, but most of these kids were trained from an early age
to cover their ears and make whooping sounds when anyone mentions anything
the slightest bit non-referential.  To be fair, they were largely athletes

i think i read in wired magazine about a year ago that there was an actual

hardly new, but I remain fond of Neil Diamond's lyric:

I am, I said
To no one there
And no one heard me,
Not even the chair.

Besides the rather obvious "Waste Land" allusion in the first line, and
indeed in the poem's tenor itself (1), the implications of the tremendous
disaffection of someone who is so sensitive (not unlike Malte Laurids
Brigge) that he *normally* hears emotional empathy from the furniture, and
then *ceases* to hear it--who can imagine the agony of the speaker whose
inanimate confidant retreats into its role as a mundane object? For that
matter, /pace/ Charlotte Perkins Gilman, what color is Mr. Diamond's
speaker's wallpaper?

Robert Hunter, musical arrangement by Jerry Garcia.

Thanks Henry for this. Whimsical thought not at all unlike the (plausible)
notion that there are original episodes of _I Love Lucy_, or FDR's Dec 8 '41
Pearl Harbor speech, floating around the galaxy still just waiting to be picked
up. Then there were Arthur C.Clarke's investigations into whether walls could

On the other hand, the anxiety that, for instance, my students have felt

Joyce predicates between the reader and himself.  As Bob Perelman points out

Then again, perhaps the speaker was just following the practice of the
talking horse, as detailed in an earlier post by Ms. Dant.

On a (slightly) more serious note: has there even been a panel at the
MLA that discussed the relation of psychoactive drugs to poetic
practice? Possibly even more, ah, illuminating, than gender in Charles
Olson -- (or Duncan!)

        I just want to put in a plug for the new Tom Mandel book,
ANCESTRAL CAVE, just out from Zasterle Press--really fine work! For me
personally it ranks up there with my two other favorite books by Tom,
REALISM and PROSPECT OF RELEASE. This new one moves from scenes of
personal intimacy to the broadest kinds of cultural and philosphical
reflection with very impressive CASUALNESS, I almost want to say.

        Zasterle has done some other quite fine books in the last year,
among them Gil Ott's THE WHOLE NOTE, Allen Ginsberg's LUMINOUS DREAMS
which arrived with a kind of terrible sadness, and Nick Piombino's LIGHT
STREET, which is so good someone actually stole it from my office--how
often does THAT happen to a book of poetry?

        I'm pretty sure that Manuel Brito, who publishes Zasterle, lurks
around this list somewhere. Perhaps he would be so good as to post an
annoucement of his recent books and how they can be purchased?

Not at this *past* MLA ("Convention attendees are hereby advised not to
eat the brown acid before interviews"), but somebody wrote a book:

/Poetic Vision and the Psychedelic Experience/, by R.A. Durr, Dell, 1970.
Cheesy cover with wavy type, but the book is actually pretty
thorough--discusses all the usual white male suspects you'd expect in a
book about the ecstatic vision: the Transcendentalists, Coleridge, Blake
to Whitman to Ginsberg, Shelley, and then a few non-usual suspects, like
Chuang Tzu. It doesn't seem to mention the Henri Michaux parable of the
tripping spider that's included in /Tent Posts/, S&M's Green Integer #4.

But is that the author's fault or the scholar-allegorists'?  Didn't Joyce
sort of recognize in advance what the "scholarship industry" was about?
And is the written page what FW is about?  After Honig's reading last night
I'm wondering if the "economy of presentation" [fake scholarly phrase
alert] of the genuine article, whatever it may be, begins with and
returns to the sound of somebody reading aloud.  Isn't that where
the free play really starts with FW? Ash Figeen sayeath inno chimpento

Yeah, but the sense that that's the way you have to deal with Joyce &
Finnegans Wake IS a learned condition. The inequality between a reader and
Joyce is only there if the reader thinks (or is taught) they have to figure
out every nuance of every portmanteau word, understand the deep structure
organizing the text, recognize all of the sigla at every appearance & then
ascertain that all of the references & jokes they find in the work were all
put there by Joyce to begin with.  The book can be read succesfully without
feeling the need to solve every puzzle by readers at varying levels.

I have no expereince with readers as young or unschooled as Ron's twins, in
two different reading group experiences, both including academics and
non-academics (some of the latter had no college literature background, &
now that I think of it, one had no college at all), no one had any trouble
getting what was going on just by reading it out loud.

Granted, no one "got" all of the neo-Finno-Uggaritic puns, but if one keeps
reading FW past whatever it is you don't understand, you always figure out
enough to get to the next muddy part.

If you can get people to treat it like a weirdly written story instead of a
source of scholarly footnotes, they'll get what's going on.

The problem isn't simply that people are too dense to understand something
this complex (& I don't mean to belittle the very real problem of college
students not caring about any information that won't help get them a job)
there's the related problem of what is considered teachable.

Especially with a text as dense & rich as Finnegans Wake, which virtually
no one masters in a life time, getting folks to turn enough pages on their
own to see that there's something worth going back to may be the best
lesson possible.

Henry Gould writes:

"But is that the author's fault or the scholar-allegorists'?  Didn't Joyce
sort of recognize in advance what the "scholarship industry" was about?"

Actually, Joyce actively encouraged scholarly annotations of his work.  For
instance, he worked closely with Stuart Gilbert to produce the famous, and
still widely available study *James Joyce's Ulysses*.  Gilbert even writes in
the preface:  "Finally it should be mentioned that in the course of writing
this Study I read it out to Joyce, chapter by chapter, and that . . .  it
contains nothing . . .  to which he did not give his full approbation; indeed
there are several passages which I directly owe to him.  Thus the long list
of examples of rhetorical forms which concludes my commentary on the "Aeolus"
episode was compiled at his suggestion, and we spent several industrious
afternoons collaborating on it.  And the opening pages of my commentary on
the episode of "The Sirens" reproduce, word for word, information given me by
Joyce."  In fact Stuart did not try to "alleviate the rather pedantic tone of
much of [his] writing [because] Joyce approved of it."  -- And Stuart, of
course, was far from being Joyce's only exegete.

Paul Vangelisti asked me to post this invitation to the listserv.

He's putting together an issue of Ribot (an annual report of the College of
Neglected Science) which will have these parameters:  poets 30 and under and
poets 65 and over.  The issue should be fairly international.  I've seen a few
of the submissions from Italy and it looks like it will be a strong issue.
Anyone who wants to submit and can do so before February 1, 1998 should send
their work to P.O. Box 65798 Los Angeles, CA 90065.  Kinda odd for a theme but
also sort of interesting.

Also, I wanted to announce to all contributors to Rhizome 2, the issue should
be out in early to mid February and you will receive your copies shortly
thereafter.

Rhizome 2 will include work from Barbara Guest, Ray DiPalma, Bernadette Mayer,
Rosmarie Waldrop, Nick Piombino, Nico Vassilakis, Noemie Maxwell, Douglas
Messerli, Martha Ronk, Franklin Bruno, Dennis Phillips, Paul Vangelisti, Bruce
Andrews, David Bromige, Norma Cole, Mark Wallace, Steve Carl, John Yau,
Jacques Debrot and a whole host of others.

Artwork by Dennis Oppenheim and others as well as a full review/essay section
including an essay on Japanese suicide notes as a genre.

Also, Rhizome will be running two newly translated Mexican fiction writers:
Fabio Morabito and Jaime Villarreal.  (Trans. Geoff Hargreaves)

Cheers, all.  Perusing as was my wont the vagaries of "poetics" along
with the whole jolly rogering crew, I scanned Mr. Gould's caustic
mandarin orangerie; and it occurred to me (Spandrift is here, actually,
if anyone's interested; he's giving a bit of a lecture series in
St. Swidefrid's College this term - "Vico, Isaiah Berlin, Ed Dorn :
Three Men in a Tub?") that the edifice of Knowledge Snobbery is
cornerstoned, kneecapped, and impedimented in something of a pyramidical
fashion much like Moby Dick's forehead - wouldn't you say?  Show your
colors, lads & lasses - & wear your longjohns, Minnesotans!  The classroom
changes everything, as my good friend Karl Manx of the British Library
was wont to say.
"Breathes there a manx with tail so dead,
 that never to hisself has said -
 play hooky, Cap'n!"

Thanks Chris for that and the Dylan, whose new album I keep hearing is
something I should check out: has anyone?

(A small point, but as this has happened before, may I make a general
announcement that my first name is actually "Joe" and it's just my

mis-posted Dorothy Trujillo Lusk's last name to make it seem as if she
were a bit too fond of alcohol, which I'm glad to report is not the case
at all)

The idea of a relationship of equality/inequality between author and reader
seems problematized (for literature that is) in an information culture such as
ours. (In Perelman's "a phrase may implicate seven meanings," was "seven" meant
(shades of Empson?), or "several?"). In *FW*, the many specific meanings may be
too many for Perelman, and those beyond first or second order are none too
specific. The free play of meaning in *FW* is inextricably tied to its sound,
and as Henry suggests, *FW* begins with and returns to sound. Finally,
explication of sense becomes virtually impossible when, as Herb Levy points
out, the reader in the end is left to "ascertain whether all of the references
and jokes they find in the work were all put there by Joyce to begin with." It
is doubtful that the play of meaning in *FW* is closed, that there is an exact
solution as "precise" is meant to suggest. As Joyce himself said in *FW*,
"confusion hold 'em."

I for one am tired of drunken poets who have nothing better to do than to
mock good scholars, as if scholarship had nothing to do with poetry [read
Silliman's Finnegan's Wake for example]. As far as I'm concerned, one
short, incisive post from Gould is worth a dozen jags from Blarnes [the
other guy isn't even worth mentioning].

Joyce's famous "defenses" of Finnegans Wake probably won't mollify or
bloomify most of the impatient or the irate or the intimidated, but they
do establish a not entirely disingenuous authorial license for reading
successfully.  Joyce claimed that the prose was "pure music" and "meant to
make you laugh."

As for the deep levels and puns, the undiscoverable and uneditable typos in
the book establish a limit to the "success" of the scholars of the next
three hundred years.

I do hate to admit my ignorance and lack of adequate background
in poetry, but my curiosity overcomes me here.  Is the "habit
of not speaking the words clearly in order to allow multiple
meanings" something the author of the lines explicitly intended?

I thought george's post of several days since (before the h.s. teaching lit
thread began, when we were still answering the unanswerable question) was
merely a cynical flourish ( "in canada, we write poetry to get our name in
the paper, so that the canada council will fly us for free to interesting
places to give readings and so forth"--I quote from memory, not his text),
but the other day i read in the toronto globe & mail that george bowering
had delivered a paper on michael ondaatje _in paris_ ! so it was all true,
every brutal word! --but what i really want to know, is what does "and so
forth" entail?

Subject:      Contemporary Russian Poets
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

My wife and I are living in Moscow and we're interested in
contacting contemporary Russian poets.  We have a long list of
names and phone numbers culled from anthologies and from
friends, but we lack information on less-translated poets and on
what's happening now in Russian poetry.

So, my main question... what does the collective poetics list "we"
know of contemporary Russian poetry, particularly of
untranslated or undertranslated poets of the past twenty years?
Name names, tell of trends, etc.

For the superslavophiles, and for those who love to talk, what
parallels/differences exist between American & Russian poetry
of the past 20 years? Does the Language Poetry/Russian Avant
Garde connection continue & how deep is/was it?  Can we
analogize the Russian tradition of the performing poet (poet as
pop star) and the "guitar poet" (pop star as poet) with the broad
range of American poetry that emphasizes the spoken word (jazz
poetry, Newyoricans, slam poetry, etc.)?

And (yes, it's connected to the above, but weirdly) does anyone
have contact info for Jeff McDaniel?

Thanks in advance for your input,

There's a Turkish writer, Bilge Karasu, who is really, really great.  One
of his books, "Night," was translated into English, as well as a small
number of other works, but the vast bulk remains in Turkish, maddeningly
untranslated.

"Thanks Chris for that and the Dylan, whose new album I keep hearing is
something I should check out: has anyone?"

My sister got it for me for Christmas - I think it's very good and that
the talk ("best since Blood on the Tracks" etc) is not hype.  It's kind of
Tom Waits-ish - raw production, rhythmically interesting, lots of very
effective subtle accompaniment by the musicians he assembled.  It sounds
like he'sbeen listening more closely to the (real) blues and (real) folk
that got him started in the first place, which ends up making things sound
more fresh, not surptising I guess, since Robert Johnson is still a good
deal more "alternative" than the great majority of the schlock on the
"alternative" radio stations.  Another plug fopr anyone even vaguely
interested in hip-hop: Cibo Matto's *Viva La Woman* - two
Japanese-American women rappers playing w/ a kind of Asian-English pidgin
on ten songs all based (in the great tradition of Gertrude Stein and
Harryette Mullen) on food; and since we've been posting lyrics, here's a
few from "Birthday Cake":

Yes, I'm cooking for my son and his wife
It's his thirtieth birthday
Pour berries into a bowl, add milk of two months ago
"It's moldy...mom, isn't it?"

SHUT UP AND EAT, TOO BAD NO BOB APPETIT!

Thomas Bell showed great grace and sensitivity to write on 98.01.09:

[R.E.M.]

Yes. Although, admittedly, it's possible that Stipe came up with the
technique before he noticed the effects it had -- but then, that's how
these things usually work, eh?

A touchstone for him is Walker Percy's essay "Metaphor as Mistake". He
says: "Anyone who really wants to figure out the words to our songs should
probably read that essay, then go back and listen. It talks about how
people misinterpret something that's being said, and come up with a little
phrase or word that actually defines the essence of what the original was
better than the original did." It's a matter of trusting "mistakes" to do
the dirty work [half the jokes in Finnegans Wake are typos] and then
accepting and encouraging "mistakes".

Famous example: in the song "I Believe", he had originally written down the
line "What do you do between the hours of the day", which is a fairly blah
line, especially out of context. But someone misread his handwriting, and
complimented him on the great image in "What do you do between the horns of
the day". Stipe went with the "misreading".

So, in a song which seems to be about children who are addicted to
television ("Catapult"), one line can be heard as:

   Coward in a hole, open mouth.
   Cower inner hope, opium mouth.
   Cowered in a hole, Opie mouth.

&c., each reading adding to the fullness of the song. It's another form of
ambiguity, one not available to written poetry (under most circumstances).

And seems to me Joyce threw a spanner into ALL the interpretive activity
by setting the entire super-intricate UFOsey whirling 6-dimensional
vibrating space canoe inside the dreaming mind of a drunken Irish
barkeeper.  Vico, the avatar of FW & a great humanist, argued contra
Descartes et al. that history was more essential than mathematics
(which is accurate only because we make up the rules) or science
(because we can never know the "nature" of mysterious Creation from
the inside the way we can know history - because language & history
are human acts & makings).  Maybe one could deduce from that the
argument that to REALLY UNDERSTAND the DEEPER MEANING of all the
triple-entendres of FW we would have to grow very OLD & get very
DRUNK in an Irish bar. (But this is being a literalist and unimaginative -
Vico himself would not approve.)

See Isaiah Berlin's excellent study of Vico in his book VICO & HERDER.

I'm with MM on this.  It's a fine, fine album, from the first cut
"Lovesick" ("I'm sick of love / I wish I'd never met you") to the last,
16-minute "Highlands."  It _does_ have a Tom Waitsish feel to it, with
maybe a bit of Leonard Cohen.  The songs keep creating dark moods of
betrayal and loss and then breaking expectations of a "silver lining"
follow-up line.  His endless tour has clearly taught him a lot.

Cheers,
David

Dreaming, unwell, I can no longer understand my dreams; dream-signs wri-
tten in false dream-kanji clutter the dream-landscape - dream-writing
becomes inert, signifier of incomprehension, and writing slips back into
the world it once mediated. Dream-world or world, dream-mediation hold-
ing back the dream-real or real, now lost to dream-interpretation: they
are _here,_ they are my dream-foreign; there is no dream-comprehension,
dream-therapeutic; only broken dream-bodies with common dream-blood and
dream-bones abound. You see you may take "dream" out of this in any
"dream-space," but you cannot add past the inert; I am dream-suffocated
in the dream-real or real; I am dream-mute, suspicious of _all_ dream-
meaning and meaning; I do not understand my dream-face or scars on my
body; I do not dream-age or age. Dreaming, unwell, I am manipulating signs
_as I speak_ and I no longer dream-understand what my dream-face or face
is saying, is desperate, unwell. Dreaming, I dream-type or type-this to
you "given the hope that" some dream-sense or sense will come, but I am
gone, dream-dead or dead, turned to dream-ash or ash, these are kanji,
are they not, you, stone, ash, body, dream, language, ash, kanji, see?

There's actually a word for song mishearings: "mondegreen," coined in the
1930s when a newspaper columnist confessed that, as a girl, she had always
heard a particular ballad as:

They hae slain the Earl of Morey
And Lady Mondegreen.

She had a vivid, touching picture of the two doomed noble lovers expiring
in each other's arms, until she found out that the second line is "and
laid him on the green."

There are three recent books of mondegreens out, edited by Gavin Edwards
of /Details/ magazine: /Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy/, /He's Got the
Whole World In His Pants/, and /When A Man Loves A Walnut./ Michael Stipe
is heavily represented in all three books.

I always heard a perfectly reasonable line from a Grateful Dead song, "get
yourself a powder charge, seal that silver mine," as "get yourself a
*pound of chocolate.*" Sadly, Garcia, sugar-rampaging diabetic, probably
would have preferred the chocolate.

"Mondegreen," I think, would also make a useful word to yell to your
golfing partners in describing your location.

The Dead line is obviously an allusion to Joseph Conrad's NOSTROMO.

        Oh, so in this context of being flown to paris, "and so forth" only
means going to museums and art galleries,testing various eateries, riding
the busses and feeding squirrels in the local parks?  I had supposed it
included off-the-record meetings with local diplomats to increase canada's
role in international markets.

"The importance of these and other flights of virtuosity can be easily
exaggerated.  They hold a fascination for everyone who enjoys puzzles,
musical or otherwise....It is less important to know that Ockegham wrote
canons than to realize, by listening to his music, that in the
comparatively few compositions where he does use such artifices, they are
artfully hidden.  It is unlikely that anyone listening to the /Missa
prolationum/, unless he were exceptionally attentive or had been alterted
beforehand, would realize that he was hearing a series of mensuration
canons; but when the underlying scheme of the work is known, one must
admire all the more the smooth melodic lines, the harmonious proportions,
and the apparent ease with which the music moves despite the formidable
technical problem which the composer has set himself."
--Donald Jay Grout, "A History of Western Music" (Norton, 1960), 163-66.

My personal fave mishearing is a friend's "Caribou Queen" for Billy
Ocean's "Caribbean Queen"--"Now our hearts stampede as one" etc.  A
similar phenomenon that's proved productive in my own writing is my
inability to make out my handwriting in earlier drafts, producing
interesting counterintuitive revisions.  What the hell _is_ that word?

This

There's an incredible book about WW1 on the Eastern Front, written about a
German Doctor in Romania. "Romanian Notebook" by Hans Castorp. It was
published in a pretty darn good English translation in the late 20s. This
is a book that should be a film. Brutal. Humane. Surreal. And very much
unique. One of those films where the camera pans over incredible scenes,
but does not linger.

Erich Kaestner's "Notebene 49" is also a vital document, detailing his
successful attempt to escape Berlin at the final collapse of the Reich by
taking a film crew to Mayrhofen, high in the Austrian Tyrol, to make a
propaganda film about happy peasant purity, and watching the remnants of
the Geman army straggle (and straggle is the word) in over the high passes
from Italy (rejected, by this point, as was also by this point Kaestner and
his film crew, by the peasants), and then his attempts to get down to
Munich, where he attempted to get work from the Americans so he did not
starve. Another candidate for a film.

Any of Handke's recent novels. Here is where translation gets sticky. In
books like "Die Chinesen des Schmerzes" and "Langsame Heimkehr" or "Mein
Jahr in der Niemandsbucht" (the latter not translated yet??) Handke creates
multi-dimensional texts. This reader found himself disappearing below the
surface of the texts, and reappearing elsewhere, each reading a different
journey, following a different thread each time, and coming out elsewhere,
randomly, in Handke's obsessive subjectivity. The books are not lines of
thought but blocks of it. It's like listening to Terry Riley in a way:
words setting up a resonance that can be moved through. The translations
lose this for me. It appears to me that the translators have chosen to
translate these novels into a particular conception of 'story', beefing up
the narrative line, but failing completely to capture the real story, the
language and the movement through the language, and the new sense of body
and world that comes from that. It is a crying shame. I have seen no books
better. But not in the translations.

Similarly, translations of Rilke lose Rilke, and again because choices were
made, which were not made by Rilke. Rilke left things open. Lost is the
sense of clarity and passion rising out of difficult syntax. Lost is the
expressionism. Gained is a certain ponderous weight and a difficulty not
present in the original. Lost is the richly-modulated voice. In the first
few lines of the first Duino elegy we have a vast range of passions, which
even Gary Miranda's beautiful translation cannot fully carry. Rilke's first
Sonnet to Orpheus can be read as Orpheus singing a temple in silence, for
'animals' to hear 'speech', or as men stumbling out of a bunker in some
godawful place outside of Verdun (for instance), and becoming, again,
human, while the posts of the bunker still trembled from a bombardment. An
unusual reading, for sure, but it is possible in Rilke, where it is
impossible in any translation I have ever seen. It's a bit like translating
Plato: all that emotion, that simplicity, that clarity, must be moved into
English, which operates by different syntactical rules, and so comes out as
something difficult, something which, in Plato's case, we have come to
recognize as philosophy, and in Rilke's as literature. I would advise
caution. Distressing that the difficulties of translation then create a
conception of literature.

"Merlin" and "Parceval" by Dorst. The TV scriptwriter from Munich really
outdid himself in these. If Monty Python's "Holy Grail" were written with
taste, as literature, by Durrenmatt, it might have been something like
these. Richly funny works, too.

Another favourite: "Die Macht der Gewohnheit" by Thomas Bernhard. This is
one of the funniest plays I know. I guess the English translation might be
something like "Force of Habit". Imagine: a circus troupe has decided that
their art form, the circus, is just not high-brow enough, and they really
want to play Schubert's Trout Quintet. Before the play begins, they spend
20 years practicing Schubert's piece, with daily rehearsals. Meanwhile,
because of this effort, their circus has deteriorated beyond the point of
total collapse. Then the play: the day before they finally perform the
Trout Quintet. We discover that they have never, in 20 years, had an actual
rehearsal, because one of them, Clown, The Lion Tamer who must play the
piano, and so forth, has found some excuse not to rehearse (and they can't
play their instruments anyway). On this occasion, the Lion Tamer has had
his hand mauled by a lion and can only thump on the piano (just like in the
music, by the way). The piece is full of slapstick and gymnastics. The
Director confesses that he has come to hate The Trout Quintet, but that is
beside the point: it must be performed. They are, ultimately, completely
unable to perform it. Very funny. What is incredible, however, is that the
play is written in verse, very repetitive verse. By the end of the play it
has become abundantly clear that they _have_ performed the Trout Quintet:
the form of the poem which is the play _is_ the Quintet. I wish I could see
this thing onstage.

best,

Okay,

I thought the first line of the Beach Boys' "Help me Rhonda" was "Since =
she put me down there's an owl hooting in my head." And I thought the =
second line of the chorus in 3 Dog Night's "Joy to the World" was "all the =

There's a wonderful book by a French writer--I'm blanking on his name and =
this probably someone everyone knows--the book is called "le Silence de la =

"Call me in Jamaica" sounds close to me. I'm still trying to figure out if I'm
right about REM's "Orange Crush" and the song called (or about) "Cuyahoga."

& also wondering if there any sites out there that support the

God, it is the Magic Mountain.

My memory is not worth anything much today. I must have a plain weird
filing system.

The guy's real name: Hans Carossa.

Geez. Carossa Carossa Carossa.

Born Dec. 15, 1878 as son of a doctor in Bad Toelz.

No mountain sanitoriums for this guy. From the jacket: During the first
world war he was a doctor with the infantry on the eastern and western
fronts and was wounded (this is supposed to signify something, I guess. A
badge of legitimacy?). His poetic works include: The Fate of Dr. Buerger;
The Transformation of a Young Man, and so on.

Well, the other names are ok, anyway.

Sorry everyone.

Yeah, I've yet to figure out the "Cuyahoga" lyrics completely. Is it
"up underneath the riverbed"? "Winnie skinned it you and me"?

Those guesses sound as good as any.  With REM, there was a certain
aesthetics of the undecipherable lyric (at least in those first five or
six albums).  Nobody could tell what the heck Michael Stipe was saying, so
it must be brilliant, right?  When they started mixing their songs so you
could make out the words, much of the glamour wore off right there.

Yeah Mark, I'm in general agreement on rock lyrics in general (about the
glamour wearing off on close examination; nothing fractal about many of them).
I was always intringued by REMs earlier songs and how they seemed to be
revisionist in a manner of writing from memory. Cuyahoga for example. What I
remember is:

Let's put our heads together
to find a new country of
Our father's, father's, father's tried
to erase the parts they didn't like

This is where they walked (swam)
this is where they swam
take a picture here

Dante puts some "musical" lyric poets in Purgatory, singing siren songs...
trying to hold back the pilgrim.  We live in a verbal jungle of steaming
vocables; there are these huge scented summer squish vines, with no
real bark or root or pith or strength, it's all lush shell.  Writing
involves nakedness in the humble sense, renunciation & sorrow.
"Why not leave their private sorrows to people?  Is sorrow not,
one asks, the only thing in the world people really possess?"
- Vladimir Nabokov, PNIN  (a wonderful, hilarious novel)
- nothing's really funny until it's heartbreaking.  avoid the bland.

how does Olson put it?  something about "so many ready
to lie down in Tiamat"  (the singers) Olson was looking for
a "middle voice" of salt-fish-laden truth.

Anyone besides me going to see Dylan with Van Morrison this month?  Can't
wait-have seen Dylan four times and it has always been amazing....first
time was with Taj Mahal and Albert King, last time was just him and an
acoustic back-up band...and the new album IS excellent.

Well, if people are interested: the online R.E.M. community's collective
best guesses are located at http://www.retroweb.com/remlyrics/index.html --
much effort over the years, much hunting down of published fragments, and
much listening to live version has helped put these together.

Hey, that's an easy one: "We knee-skinned it, you and me." Hence the river
becoming red.

With the advent of digital recording REM opted to continue recording
Stipe's lyrics, for some time, on analog equipment to retain that
"undecipherable"-ness. Which is opposite to the norm where most bands
record instruments on analog to retain a raspy feel and vocals are
normally recorded on digital for clarity.

For a while this was because Stipe's voice had a tendency to crack. being
from the olde South where they started out, I've heard numerous bootlegs
where Stipe's voice makes ya wince. He often even sang with his back to
the crowd.

When I was playing ball in shorts once last summer, well I should mention
that I have thin white legs---my daughter shouted so all the other players
could hear
"Are those your legs, or are you riding a chicken?"

The Attempted* Rewrite: Diseases of Being


Dreaming, dreaming, unwell, dreaming, I can no longer understand my
dreams; dream-signs written in false dream-kanji clutter the dream-
landscape - dream-writing becomes inert, dreaming, signifier of
incomprehension, dreaming, and writing slips back into the world it
once mediated. Dream-world or world, dreaming, dream-mediation hold-
ing back the dream-real or real, dreaming, now lost to dream-interpre-
tation: they are _here, dreaming,_ they are my dream-foreign; there is
no dream-comprehension, dreaming, dream-therapeutic; only broken
dream-bodies with common dream-blood and dream-bones abound. You see
you may take "dream" out of this in any "dream-space, dreaming," but
you cannot add past the inert; I am dream-suffocated in the dream-real
or real; I am dream-mute, dreaming, suspicious of _all_ dream-meaning
and meaning; I do not understand my dream-face or scars on my body; I
do not dream-age or age.. Dreaming, dreaming, unwell, dreaming, I am
manipulating signs _as I speak_ and I no longer dream-understand what
my dream-face or face is saying, dreaming, is desperate, dreaming,
unwell. Dreaming, dreaming, I dream-type or type-this to you "given
the hope that" some dream-sense or sense will come, dreaming, but I am
gone, dreaming, dream-dead or dead, dreaming, turned to dream-ash or
ash, dreaming, these are kanji, dreaming, are they not, dreaming, you,
dreaming, stone, dreaming, ash, dreaming, body, dreaming, dream,
dreaming, language, dreaming, ash, dreaming, kanji, dreaming, see?
See in the real, dreaming, the scene everywhere, dreaming, the seen
everywhere in the real. I am dying, dreaming, here. Dreaming collapses
reals into dreams. Again and again as an example I can watch my body
fall. Again and again I am dreamed.

(Sometimes I think if I knew who you are, it would be simpler. I would
untangle. But I do not know who you are, where you are, when you are
there. I do not know if you are there. I do not know if there is you.
If I understood _how to properly ask the question,_ with the requisite
degree of etiquette, with the requisite forms of grammar, with the in-
visible forms of grammar, with the passing-forms, with the passings,
then - if I understood _how to ask the question,_ already it would be
a simpler untangling. I can continue to speculate, but it is from ig-
norance. I have forgotten axioms, bases, which I never knew. When my
mouth opens, it empties. It empties itself of speech and sensibility.
When I open my body, it is a carapace filled with ornament. There are
kanji I cannot read, dream-kanji, not-real kanji. Nothing readable by
any conceivable reader in this or any possible world. Do you under-
stand at least this much, the possibility of worlds? The relative ab-
sence of such worlds, and there are no mirrors.

This is it, the writing of worlds without mirrors, and in a foreign
language, and there's more, because they're impossible worlds, and
where would this lead? Neither neurosis nor psychosis, but a relative
_disease of the throat_ I have written about before, continually writ-
ten about. A _disease of the throat_ or perhaps mind in the vocal
apparatus itself - I would say that - something never leaving a trace
but drawing itself in _uncanny_ ways, as if there were a face behind
the nonsense, or as if nonsense were organized _in such a manner,_
through the proper forms, as to appear otherwise than itself - as if I
myself were capable of such appearance, this _otherwise_ splitting me
from language, slitting or cutting my throat, the blood forming mean-
ingless patterns on the ground.)



*Footnote to the above: At first, I would do nothing but create the form
(dream-x and x). Then it seemed that the equation seeped from the page,
(virtual-x and x), shaming me. Then I forgot my name. Then I wrote and
rewrote, forgetting my name. Then would I pause, this most important of
all writings, where worlds are mute; can I even say this?

My subject is a popular Dylan mondegreen.

The best site on the web for mondegreens (or at least my favorite) is:

www.sfgate.com/columnists/carroll/mondegreens.shtml

There is one example in there, be warned, that ruined my ability to
listen to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds ever again:
Instead of "the girl with kaleidoscope eyes"
"the girl with colitis goes by"

On the new Dylan CD, yes, it's simply terrific. Certainly seems the best
since Nashville Skyline and possibly even Blonde on Blonde.

From the R.E.M. lyric annotations FAQ:

http://www.brainlink.com/~cafard/remlafaq.txt

"The title of the song . . . refers indirectly to the incident in Oct.
1986 in which Dan Rather . . . was attacked by two unknown men in the
street in New York City wearing suits and sunglasses.  The men kept
asking Rather "What is the frequency?" and called him "Kenneth" while
they shoved and accosted him; to date the incident has never been
explained completely . . ."

I offer my own incomplete explanation in "Clueless in Paradise"
(published a few years before the R.E.M. song).  Am guessing there might
be enough "what is the frequency" poems for a good-sized anthology by
now.

     When I first heard the new Dylan, I thought, "Gee, this is just a
50-something year-old guy whining," but after listening repeatedly (for some
reason I _did_ listen repeatedly), I have realized that it is  wonderful
whining.

I always heard "Our Lips Are Sealed," an '80's song by the GoGos (whose
diction was particularly poor) as "Aunt Cecile."

And lifelong Communist Party member Jessica Mitford heard "fine old
conflict" for "final conflict" in the lyrics of the Internationale.

[Oops -- meant to send this to the list. Thanks to the person who quoted me.]

I can't believe this thread continues.

Karen and Trevor showed great grace and sensitivity to write on 98.01.09:

> So anyone heard about the origin for "what's the frequency Kenneth?"

From Ron Henry's excellent R.E.M. FAQ:

 o C5. "What do the lyrics to 'What's the Frequency, Kenneth?' mean?"

   Stipe was quoted in several interviews at the time of _Monster_'s
   release as saying it is written from the perspective of a person
   who's getting older trying to understand current youth culture.

   Note that the lyric (printed inside) contains a quote from
   Richard Linklater, director of the film _Slacker_: "Withdrawal
   in disgust is not the same as apathy" -- a rebuttal of sorts to
   those of older generations who would claim that Generation Xers,
   or "slackers," are merely spoiled, lazy brats.  (This line of
   argument would say that "slackers" have *chosen* to exclude
   themselves from mainstream society as a protest against its empty
   values.)

   It has also been noted that the "shirt of violent green" mentioned
   in the lyric may by a reference to a Spider Robinson short story
   entitled "Lady Slings the Booze," which also makes use of the
   phrase "What's the frequency, Kenneth?"

o C6. "What is the connection between 'WTF,K?' and Dan Rather?"

   The title of the song itself, it needs to be explained, refers
   indirectly to the incident in  Oct. 1986 in which Dan Rather,
   anchor for C.B.S.'s network news broadcast, was attacked by
   two unknown men in the street in New York City wearing suits and
   sunglasses.  The men kept asking Rather "What is the frequency?"
   and called him "Kenneth" while they shoved and accosted
   him; to date the incident has never been explained completely
   (though some have theorized that "Kenneth" might be Ken Schafer,
   an electronics expert with whom Rather had worked in connection
   with Soviet TV broadcasts).  Since the incident, "What's the
   frequency?" and calling a clueless person a "kenneth" have
   become a trendy youth culture catch-phrases (which is probably,
   why Stipe wanted to use it, rather than an interest in Rather).

   Please note that the supposed reference to Rather and CBS news in
   the "Ignoreland" lyric was incorrect, so there is *no* tie-in that
   we know of between the two songs regarding the newsanchor.  Mr.
   Rather, meanwhile, has taken the "tribute" in good spirits and has
   been quoted as saying he has always liked R.E.M., that he owns the
   _Monster_ CD, and suggested jokingly that the band's name really
   stands for "Rather's Excellent Musicians," before proceeding to
   sing the chorus of "It's the End of the World As We Know It,"
   during his recent Letterman appearance!

   Also note in passing that the album _Lolita Nation_ by Game Theory,
   released in 1987 and produced by Mitch Easter (there's another R.E.M.
   connection) contains a similarly titled song: "Kenneth -- What's the
   Frequency?"; WTF,K? is not a cover of that, of course -- the resemblance
   pretty much stops at the title.  Other newsgroup readers here have noted
   that the phrase may also have popped up in the movie "The Conversation"
   and in Dan Clowes' comic "Eightball".

Phew! I'm so sure you all cared... Ron himself is on this list, somewhere,
by the way. For more R.E.M. info, check out the main FAQ at
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/8789/remfaq.htm .

And while you're there, check out Ron's lit e-mag, "Aught", located at
http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/8789/aught.htm , which is looking for
submissions for its second issue. It's probably of more interest to most of
you than the R.E.M.-related stuff.

Apologizes to those of you who really don't care about R.E.M., especially
when not discussed in a Poetics context.

Susan: there goes some "riddles" I found (reading Riding):


"And talk in talk like time vanishes.
Ringing changes on dumb supposition,
Conversation succeeds conversation,
Until there's nothing left to talk about,
Except truth, the perennial monologue,
And no talker to dispute but itself"

***

"And you may write as it seems,
And as it seems, it is,
A seeming stilness
Amid seeming speed."

***

"And once more is yesterday".

Personally, I'm happy if it can rate alongside _Oh Mercy_, a grossly
underrated effort IMO.  I'm still listening and deciding whether it does.
_Time Out of Mind_ definitely has some beautiful songs, but I'm not sure I
like the uni-coloredness of it.

Wow, where's this tour taking him?  I saw him last summer with Ani DiFranco,
a concert I probably would have more details to share if it hadn't been
pouring rain and me without indoor seats (Tanglewood).

  Hello Robin---it has been a long time. Anyway, yes, I agree--
   though I like the new album, I don't see why it's suppossed to be
   "better" than OH MERCY (or even GOOD AS I BEEN TO YOU or INFIDELS)
   which to me are just as good.....chris

I lived in Paris for a year. When I first moved into my apartment I had
some workmen over to install a new electric range. It seemed to me that
they were screing up the grounding, and I wanted to say something about it.
To give myself some credibility I meant to tell them "je suis un vieux
bricoleur," I'm an experienced do-it-yourselfer. What came out,
unaccountably, was, "je suis un vieux cambrioleur." I certainly got their
attention: I had told them that I was a burglar from way back.
Almost a year later I was dating a Canadian woman. We went to a restaurant
that specialized in wild game. It was the sort of place where old beer mugs
hang from the ceiling and clients and waiters toss wisecracks at each
other. I ordered the beaver, and I asked the waiter what cut it was. "I
don't know," he said, "it's just beaver."
"I was hoping," I meant to say, "that it's the tail." My girlfriend turned
beet-red, and the waiter got very flustered.
"We would never serve that sort of thing here!"
"That's a shame. It's a delicacy in Canada," I explained.
The waiter allowed as how this was news to him, but reiterated that it
wasn't likely to get served in his restaurant.
Through a mispronunciation and a gender error I had asked for "le cul," the
asshole, instead of "la queue," the tail.
The beaver, by the way, was delicious.
As to song lyrics, I always thought that Dylan was singing "tastes just
like a woman," and I liked it that way. Nuff said.

"le cul" is not "asshole" but "ass" as in "a piece of ass" -- so it wasn't
scatology that made your girl-friend turn beet-red. Of course, had you said
"la queue" it wouldn't have been any better, as that means not only "tail" but
also "prick."

non sequitur one: note how in French "le cul" is grammatically masculine and
"la queue" feminine.

non sequitur two: "le castor," the beaver, was the nickname of Simone de
Beauvoir — the reason being her industriousness rather than anything else.

Bob's new album, well, like most of the his other ones, seems like an
uncanny success - why?  He's not a very good musician, really; never was
very imaginative, musically - he's one of those people whose musical talent
doesn't match their general genius - he's a poet manque, so to speak - so
the performance is always sort of a charlie chaplin affair - for Dylan
performing must have always seemed like "rock-climbing" (no pun intended)
for somebody suffering from vertigo.  Springsteen something similar except he
is a slightly different equation : lesser poetic talent + greater showmanship
= grandiosity - but still it begins with poetry... & dribbles out into success.
.. Dylan always adds that element of self-parody which makes it all work...
because he came from beyond Duluth with more hunger & ambition & earliness
than even Springsteen New Jersey...  but for sheer musical creative
energy I'll take a good Cream jam ("I'm So Glad") over ANYTHING
produced in the last 30 yrs hence...where's Jack Bruce now?   - Henry Gould,
member of (in chronological order): Spur of the Moment (late 60s)
Lucifer (later 60s) various London bands (mid 70s) Phyllis & the
Phantoms (late 80s) & so on... & who could forget the Stones?
they would have been very wealthy farmers if they weren't good rockers.

Beavers are a minefield of innuendo. When I was a kid we used to play a car
game the rules of which were that you had to shout out "beaver!" if we
passed a car with a bearded driver or passenger. This was designed to keep
the kids occupied on long trips. Of course, there were so few bearded
people back then that my father's other little game worked a lot better,
which was to call out "teachers!" whenever we saw two women alone in a car.
The implication was supposed to be that the women, like all teachers, were
lesbians--my father never really accepted my mother's profession.
When I was older the significance of "beaver" migrated south, and it become
a matter of considerable speculation how any woman could admit without
embarrassment to being a graduate of Beaver College, which was all-female
at the time.
All of this depends on context. I have ordered "queue de boeuf" in
restaurants without any giggles, and of course when one is directed to
stand in "la queue" while waiting for a film no one leers or pokes his
friend in the ribs. I did see "penis de boeuf" offered on a chinese menu in
Paris, but that's an entirely different story. I once heard a panelist on a
French news show refer to a right-wing opponent as "le penis," playing on
the name of the politician Le Pen; this provoked universal merriment. But
often a cigar is just a cigar.

Just for the record, Jessica Mitford resigned from the CP in 1958 and
lived almost another forty years.

But in the spirit of this thread, she once wrote to her mother, Lady
Redesdale (who was interested in social chatter), that she had enjoyed
having tea with Lady Bird Johnson.  Her mother wrote back, "I have
checked Debrett's and can find no mention of this Lady Bird-Johnson."

I'm the only person I know who *knew this* when the REM album came
out....I actually pay less attention to that dubious substance the
mainstream media calls "the news" than lots and lots of other folks, most
of the time...But for some reason I read a newspaper account of the Dan
Rather attack (a couple, I think) at the time it happened.  (If for a
moment we credit its happening.) The accounts I saw were more lurid than
what Rachel quotes: the two men supposedly knocked him down and *kicked*
him a few times as he was on the ground, accompanying each kick with a
shout of "What's the frequency, Kenneth?"  Rather said the men were
totally unknown to him.  One of my all-time favorite instant urban myths
(legends?)

By the time I learned R. Kelly's line "Summer bun it drive me crazy" was
actually "Summer bunnies drive me crazy" I'd sampled it in print, so now the

last year, WIRED - yes, it's not the most reliable
news source, and no, I'm not one of those young
corporate types - did a follow-up on the attack
that named the chief suspect. sorry I can't be more

thing, and toyed with using WTF, K? as a title -
but then never did.

Subject:      the new Dylan album
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I'm glad some of you are responding positively to Time Out of Mind (as
usual, I can't remember who in all said what all); it's interesting to
discuss.

I think it's the best since Desire, but certainly *not* as Ron said since
Nashville Skyline. Dylan's great, greatest, most greatesterest (i.e. my
favorite) album, Blood on the Tracks, from 1970 is subsequent to NS.

On the new album, my favorite cut is "40 mi out of town in heavy chains
bound" or something like that (I'm nowhere near the CD - hundreds of miles
away - so can't check the title I don't exactly recall). But, very worth
mentioning -- in the context of Desire, which I brought up for exactly this
reason -- is My Heart's in the Highlands, a dark dark number whose music is
an exact copy of "Meet me in the morning" from Desire (or is that on Blood
on the Tracks? -- hell, this internet stuff ain't what it's cracked up to
be. I can't reach my memory any better however ubiquitously present
something or other, oh yeah you, is [are?]).

Emmylou Harris's backing vocals on Desire are totally great, but my
favorite cut on that disc is "Sarah" written for his long-time (but by then
x) wife. I listened to that song, having been reminded of it by the
estimable Doug Lang, last year for about a week straight and typed the
lyrics onto my screen. Just a personal thing.

A great song from Dylan's supposedly dog days (the Xtian period in this
case) is "Every Grain of Sand" -- on I think A Shot of Love. I also
recommend Emmylou Harris's version of that song on her recent disc Wrecking
Ball (and also on that album her version of Neil Young's song of that
title). A couple of years ago, over a period of days of driving around DC
via the beltway from meeting to meeting, I kept her version of the Dylan
song on repeat on my car's CD player. I must have listened to it 40 times
each day. It is my favorite version of a "spiritual" (which is what I think
you have to call that song) by a "pop" artist after Marvin Gaye's rendition
of "His Eye is on the Sparrow."

It's afternoon, I'm in a motel in Myrtle Beach (believe it or not... Hank
will know what I'm doing here for a few days), somewhat sunned out and a
beer or so in expectation of an evening meal among gov't. retirees I don't
know. Makes a nice change to think of Bob Dylan, whom by the way I met
briefly in mutual drunkenness at the University of Chicago folk festival in
1961 I think when he was on his way from Minnesota to NY to seek his
fortune. Seemed a nice enough guy who almost fell from the balcony but
someone caught his arm. That'd make an even more different world.

Sorry to go on...

Well, this one is not exactly a misheard lyric and won't cause smirks and
laughter, but is maybe worth sharing anyway.

A prof reading a term paper on Yeats comes across the phrase "fantasy echo"
thoughout, and is curious as to what the undergraduate means by it and where
it comes from.  The two meet to talk, the prof poses his questions, and
the student replies, "But you used it yourself all semester in your lectures
about the fantasy echo."  At which point the prof realizes that the phrase
has replaced "fin de siecle."  I like the way the replacement has named itself.

As a long-time participant in and follower of the American visual poetry

visual poets as Karl Kempton, Karl Young, Crag Hill, Miekal And, Liz
Was, Jonathan Brannen, G. Huth, Trudy Mercer, John Byrum, Richard
Kostelanetz, Dick Higgins, Bill DiMichele, Gregory St. Thomasino,
Marilyn Rosenberg, Michael Basinski, Jake Berry, Scott Helmes, Harry
Polinhorn (and on and on, to speak only of those contemporary American
visual poets whose names are on the tip of my tongue), chooses instead
to kick off her graduate seminar in visual poetics with a reading by
Charles Bernstein, who is a late-coming dabbler in the field, and needs
no career boosts.

I hafta chime in that Ive been bummed all day after reading about
Marjorie Ps visual poetry seminar & not recognizing any of the names as
poets whose work has a basis in visual poetry other than Johanna
Drucker.  & especially the absence of all the folks whove been digging
the trenches & foxholes in the visual/verbal front.  It seems more like
a series on the l+a+n+g+u+a+g+e crowd who also happen to have created at
least one visual work.

bob and miekal

with subject raised, and disappointments registered (justified, by all
means), maybe now would be a good time to ask either or both of you to
post, if you could, some good references for history and current practice
in vis-po / survey works, perhaps, to give people like me who are
relatively new to it (as student, as practitioner) a good overview / paper
and online / etc.

thanks

Oh dear, don't tell me this is an urban legend.  In the recent issue of
Profession (MLA pub) Sandra Gilbert claims that her late husband Elliot
Gilbert received a paper from a student who kept referring to the Fantasy
Eclair where Wilde and all his cronies lived. This seemed just like the kind
of thing that would occur to Elliot Gilbert (I had known him at UC DAvis).
I suppose it is actually possible they both happened.  I prefer the Fantasy
Eclair myself.

Well, since everyone else is confessing their mis-hearings, I suppose I
could confess mine, my most egregious one.

Somehow, when I landed on this earth, with a loud thud a long time ago, I
landed reason unknown among Roman Catholics, and I wound up for a while as
a child among these Roman Catholics in Irish Boston, in churches where
Latin was still the language of the liturgy.

I remember, I think, standing there among the stale damp pews and the
candle lights and the nuns all in their black and white and smoky incest
[sic], listening to the priests and the angelic choir boys, black and
white.

What were they all saying? I wondered. And why?

Well, for the most part it all slips by me now, in my present irreligious
stupor, but I do remember the closing prayers. And it goes like this:

        Eight come spirit two two O...
        Eat the missa est.

Well, I now know what the Latin was [et cum spiritu tuo... ite missa
est...], but I probably will *never* know what they really meant as they
sang that song,

But it seems to me that this very religious experience [sic] turned me
surely into one who has, ever since, felt a great and permanent urge to
seek out and to know, for sure, what exactly the frequency was, Kenneth,
and also the code....

You never know...

I'd like to second that request.

I think Tom Mandel should be _encouraged_ to go ongoing on We dont hear
nearly enough of him. And I want "Hank," whoever he is, to post in and tell
us just what Tom _is_ up to there at Myrtle Beach....I mean, why cant we
_all_ know?

Tom's post is full of info I dont have the referents for--I dont know any
of these dylan albums he mentions. _Was_ there something after _Highway
61__ ? My Mondegreen is from (I think) "Desolation Row," "Yes I got yr
letter yesterday/ About the time the Donner broke."  Years later, via sheet
music, I saw it was "doorknob." But in No Calif, Donner is always on your
mind. And, on the Mondegreen track still,  at a party the other night at
Kathy Fraser's,I discovered from Kush that my wife hadnt been the only
person who thought that one line from "Groovin" [quick! what group?] was
"Life could be ecstasy, /You and me and Leslie." Turns out it was probably
"endlessly."

Hello everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  Hope some of you are in the Bay Area
and free on Wednesday.  There's a new monthly series at the "Different
Light" bookstore on Castro Street, called "Under the Influence," curated by
Rabih Alameddine, who has asked different writers to talk about writers who
have influenced their own work.  I think Bob Gluck will speak about Kathy
Acker, and Etel Adnan on Marguerite Yourcenar, in months to come, but more
to the point this Wednesday, Jan 14, I, I, Kevin, will kick off the series
by speaking on Sir Terence Rattigan.  Norma Cole, Rex Ray, Wayne Smith and
I will be acting out scenes from Rattigan's 1950 drama "The Deep Blue Sea."
You don't want to miss me essaying "Hester Collyer," the tragic heroine
first made famous by Vivien Leigh, do you (7:30 p.m.)?

Hokay, in response to Bill Marsh's request for "some good references for
history and current practice in vis-po / survey works, perhaps, to give
people like (he) who are relatively new to it (as student, as
practitioner) a good overview / paper and online / etc.  As I previously
wrote when Marjorie Perloff asked what might be of use to her in running
her seminar, a good book to start with as a rough overview of what's
going on in the field and, especially, who's involved in it (it even
includes Charles Bernstein) is CORE, A Symposium on Contemporary Visual
Poetry, edited by John Byrum and Crag Hill, 1993, a joint publication of
Generator Press and Score Publications.  It has the following useful
bibliography of vispo anthologies.

BORY, JEAN-FRANCOIS, Once Again, New Directions, 1968.
BOWLES, JERRY G. & RUSSELL, TONY, editors, This Book is a Movie: An
Exhibition of Language Art & Visual Poetry, Dell Publishing Co., 1971.
CURTAY, JEAN-PAUL, Lettrism and Hypergraphics, The Unknown Avant-Garde
1945-1985, Franklin Furnace, 1985.
DORIA, CHARLES, editor, Russian Samizdat Art, Willis Locker & Owens
Publishing, 1986.
GRUMMAN, BOB, Of Manywhere-at-Once, Runaway Spoon Press, 1990.
HIGGINS, DICK, George Herbert's Pattern Poems: In Their Tradition,
Unpublished Editions, 1977.
HIGG1NS, DICK, Pattern Poems: Guide to an Unknown Literature, State
University of New York Press, 1987.
JANECEK, GERALD, editor, The Look of Russian Literature: A vant-Garde
Visual Experiments 1900-1930, Princeton University Press, 1984.
KOSTELANETZ, RICHARD, editor, Text-Sound Texts, William Morrow & Co.,
1980.
KOSTELANETZ, RICHARD, editor, Visual Literature Criticism: A New
Collection, West Coast Poetry Review, 1979.
MCCAFFERY, STEVE & NICHOL, BP, editors, Sound Poetry: A Catalogue, Under
Which Editions, 1978.
SACKNER, MARVIN, editor, The Beauty in Breathing, Ruth & Marvin Sackner
Archive, 1992.
SOLT, MARY ELLEN, editor, Concrete Poetry: A World View, Indiana
University Press, 1968.
WILDMAN, EUGENE, editor, Anthology of Concretism, The Swallow Press,
1969.
WILLIAMS, EMMETT, editor, Anthology of Concrete Poetry, Something Else
Press, 1967.

My own book (awaiting my getting enough money to self-publish a third
edition--to update my psychofluxotical terminology) is more a discussion
of poetry in general than an anthology of vispo but DOES contain a
pretty good small sampling of the field.

Then there's CONCERNING CONCRETE POETRY, compiled by Bob Cobbing and
Peter Mayer, from 1978, and now a classic.

Crag Hill and Spencer Selby's SCORE and Karl Kempton's magazine,
KALDRON, the latter now online at

         http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm

have to my mind the best continuing coverage of visual poetry, but
others, including Harry Burris's O!!ZONE, are doing good work.  The l&d
site whose URL I've just given has much else in the way of visual poetry
and other kinds of otherstream and knownstream poetry.  And it lists all
kinds of links to other sites, as well as pertinent books and magazines.

jwcurry's Curvd H$Z is the central press for Canadian visual poetry.
His magazine Industrial Sabotage has long been a leader in the field.
There's much else.  Miekal And and Liz Was's Xexoxial Press, for
instance, and my own Runaway Spoon Press, have for ten years or more
been publishing visual poetry.

Anything else you wanna know, just ask.

I am sure they can give you such references but I cannot resist an advert
here - Bob Cobbing who has been visualling more years than etc and I with a
somewhat shorter track record - are working on a book on vispo and their
performance with lotsa examples which will be out from Writers Forum in
London in the mid year

Quite a few from N America in it so one way or the other, probably the
other, it'll reach N America - shall post details when available

As there have been several recent postings to the list concering visual
poetry, let me direct your attention to the O.ARS home page where you
will find information concerning the back list and something of a fire
sale. From 1982 thru 1994 O.ARS produced anthologies of poetry, visual
poetry, and other forms of experiemental writing, including works by
many authors familiar to this list. In particular O.ARS attempted to
embrace the diverse range of visual poetries that have recently been
under discussion here.

Anyone citing this posting will receive an additional 20% discount on

<BR>Since its inception in 1981, O.ARS has been mindful of the limitations
of closed systems of representation with their corresponding domains of
the other. The watch word has been, following Charles Olson, to push outward,
beyond the mesmerizing seas of Modernism and into a present where mirrors
no longer divert the body by splitting perception into self and other,
lack and perfection.

<P>The oarsman pulls away from the shore, eyes on the past as it recedes.
Hence one suggestion in the name O.ARS. The period, Oh Art, a dada-esque
pun. Destruction, whether of mirror, syntax, or word: TOWARD A NEW POETIC,
a way of making, a way of making a way, not absolute freedom. The oar is
a winnowing fan as well as a blade cutting the current. Each issue of O.ARS
presents a selection of poetry, visual poetry, experimental prose, essays,
and reviews by writers for whom meaning and language are one.

I'd love to hear more about the American visual poets Miekel And
mentioned, but I'd also like to mention a book that I first heard about
over this list and that introduced me to a number of visual poets from
around the world, and that placed them in historical context -- a
collection of essays edited by Johanna Drucker called _Experimental,
Visual, Concrete_ (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1996 or 1997).  Both Perloff and
Bernstein have pieces in the book, but it is very diverse and
international and in no way treats visual poetry as a sideline of the
language poets.

The publisher has a web site at:

As one who innocently started the Dylan thread by asking if the album
was worth picking up, I wonder about Don's "challenge"' -- what might be
the nominees for said book of poems? _Imagination Verses_ by Jennifer
Moxley attracted a bit of response not too far back; a reading group in
Seattle recently was pretty high on Tom Raworth's new _Selected_; I
liked Anselm's _Ahoe_ quite a bit . . .

Hopefully not on this list, but let's face it . . . "no one listens to
poetry"

it is the unacknowledged paperwork of the 20th century which for me
informs much of the unclassifyable realms of experimentations with the
voice & the page, of which the words "visual poetry" is one tagword that
can be used to contain the works of zaum, lettrism, dada, gutai,
concrete, fluxus, futurism, mailart, etcism & especially the o so
important people whose work has always defied classification & thus gets
forgotten time after time. which hotlinks me to Bern Porter's 1959
manifesto I've Left,  a wakeup call to the artworld to enter & become
the information age, very much like Vannevar Bush's visualization of the
once & future internet "As we may think" is a call to information linear
civilization to start defending itselves with neural networks.


excerpted from I've Left:


"I am proposing something to help get out of the stagnation, instead of
continuing to bewail it, and the boredom, inertia and stupidity of
everything."  Antonin Artaud

"Everything touched by and serving living beings must either be adapted
to the fact that the user's life is organic or must corrupt the user by
withdrawing his attention from this fact." Edward Hyams

I finger zero, readjust my couch in a void that sloth built, the better
to do nothing.

Through inaction I act and out of negation I fabricate the debris whose
weight litters the plains with the broken backs of cranes & stevedores.

The result is the same as if I did nothing: which I do daily.

Obsolenscence revolts me.  The alleged modern is a repetition of the
ancient decorated in chrome, styled with air-flow and color-engineered
to abomination.  Tradition-bound, without sense or reason and always
beyond complete control, truth & simplicity, the popularly accepted give
wide berth to basic naturalness and inherent possibility.

Thus, communication-wise I junk drum beats, smoke signals, semaphore,
flag codes, light flashes, telegraphs, telephones, radios, television
sets and all other such systems, devices and developments for my own
sensory organs wherein desiring to make known my wishes I merely think
them in a frequency universal and in a tongue world known and whoever
wishes to hear, receive and understand does so.

The spoken, printed and tele-dramatized word becomes a particle of
thought energy.

The drawn, photographed, painted and kinescope-picture becomes more of
the same.

All of the devices of locomotion, subterranean, surface and aerial
equally reduce.

I am at all places, in all forms, at all times.

What were books became word sequences screen projected, then
free-floating vibrations which impinged upon my mind as I desired them.

What was art left museum walls to become gaseous fusions in color
similarly projected, then all prevailing rhythms of radiant energy that
stimulated my eye whenever I wished them.

What was poetry became equally transformed to responses for feeling.

Architecture became constructions of ether & light.

Clothing a logical extension of skin without embellishment.

Theatre a pageant of masked spectators.

Automobiles, body rockets.

Toys, fondling in the dark.

No civilized thing was left unmodified or unreverted to its natural,
logical and true state.

I transformed the world and in so doing I found myself.


1959, Tasmania

transcribed from Bern Porter's I've Left; a manifesto and a testament of
science & art, published by Something Else Press, 1971.

is a hypertext visual poetry? is a poet performing the print of a
cross-section of a cabbage visual poetry? is an envelope circulated from
person to person & country to country visual poetry? are font dingbats
visual poetry?  the convergence of hypermedia in the 20th century is
technological & inextricably organic & moving at biologically recursive
speeds toward a global mimesis of international sightsound.  but then
these thoughts are by no means new, just as functionality in advertising
has always been good business.

overheard from el lissitzky in 1923

1) Printed words are seen and not heard.

2) Thoughts are communicated by the appropriate words and formed letters
of the alphabet.

3) Thoughts should be expressed with maximum economy, optically and
phonetically.

4) A composition of text on a page is governed by the laws of
typographical mechanics-it should reflect the flow and rhthm of the
contents.

5) Illustrative material should be used to organize a page in accordance
with the new visual period.

6) A sequence of pages, the cineamatographic book.

7) A new book requires new means of writing, the ink well and quill are
a thing of the past.

8) A printed book has conquered time and space. Printed pages and the
infinity of books must be conquered. Electro Library.

thanks to whoever it was that posted the url for Light & Dust.  By a
random click i found the work of Avelino de Araujo, much of which is
really quite beautiful.  The direct link to his section is
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/araujo.htm

Some of it's a little quirky and looks like advertisement-style art, but
all of it's interesting.

For Miekal and others:

The syllabus for Visual Poetics has on it precisely fluxus, zaum, and
later movements that interest you.  Tom Phillips, Ian Hamilton Finlay,
Darren Werschler-Henry, etc.  The poets giving readings are poets IN THE
AREA FOR OTHER READINGS whom I can get for relatively small amount.  I
can't get Tom Phillips or Ian Hamilton Finlay or even a Canadian poet like
Darren because costs of flights.  So it's a compromise and I stand by each
and every poet coming as being visually interesting!

Before you jump to such conclusions, perhaps you could think about these
logistics and not be so dismissive!

Important recent books for me have been:

Stepping Razor - Aldon Nielsen
il cuore: the heart - Kathleen Fraser
Prosepct of Release - Tom Mandel

I'm intrigued by Brenda Hillman's _Loose Sugar_, and would be interested
in others' response to this work. I've only had it a couple of days, but
so far am struck by the way she has opened up her work to more
experimental techniques while retaining a backbone of more traditional
narrative. I find the way she's gone at this more appealing - and far
less pretentious - than the  way Jorie Graham has.

                Isn't it curious that we have extended discussions of
Dylan's album, but rarely, if ever, a comparable discussion of a new
book of
poetry.  I wonder if there is a book of poetry, published in the last
year,
that five people on the list have read.

"I think the narrowness shoe
here is on the other foot."

dear marjorie

the alto of your posts seems defensive & confronted & methinks that you
are misreading my intentions, as my stance from the beginning of
publishing my work & the work of others has always been one of
inclusion, the known & the celebrated next to the neverknown.  even tho
your roster of visual poets seems to need a shoehorn to fit into the
international visual poetry movement & "seems" to be largely a language
reading list, I am more concerned about rationalizing your choices
because of financial limitations.  I mean really, most of the 100s of
visual poets whose work is important in this discussion would present
their work gratefully for the cost of a bus ticket & a hot meal.  or
closer to home, how many visual poets within shouting distance of
stanford were invited to present their works....

as for course syllabi, my contention is that the visual poetry world is
specifically international & infested with sacred clowns & dada savants
whose work will never fall into a convenient catagory, because their
work experiments with all edges of hypermedia, & what is a more
appropriate reading than a survey of movements is a hyperlinked time
machine that has a holographic & inclusive meme as its operating engine,
kind of like reading all 30,000 volumes of the Sackner visual/verbal
archive simultaneously.

so if we're in the business of trying on shoes, I highly recommend those
shiny new ambidextrous stretch shoes over there in the corner.  one size
fits all & Im sure there can be no complaints.

in the spirit of networking & open dialogue

miekal "one size fits all" and

as far as I know it is out of print, & Bern is getting up there in
years, so it is a possibility, as well there is a talk about doing
Bern's book about Abraham Lincoln Gillespie, who he considers one of the
most overlooked experimental writers of this century (& I think Bern is
one of the most overlooked (& maybe someday someone will decide that I
in turn am one of the most....

& Hold onto Your Hat, a book of interviews with Bern which should have
been out 6 months ago will hopefully be out by spring....

I've got Dylan on my mind as well, as pressing as any book of poems.  I
disagree with most of the elders on this list by saying I think the new
Dylan album is terrible.  The best parts of it sound unrehearsed like The
Basement Tapes, but its obvious throughout the deal that the producers
crafted and shined it up into a comeback album, in the same mode as
hit-pumps Clapton and McCartney.  I'd say the Christian stuff, when
compared with the new album, is even more radical, if only because Dylan
is still inventing himself, picking up influences and identities as he
did in almost every early album.  But as the "adult-contemporary" humor
walks in, the social-lyricism is not really there, and nostalgia seems to
be too motivated, rather than what's going on in the basement a few
decades before, when Dylan's looking for a history of music from the
porch rather than the stage, looking like Harry Mathews did.  Where's
that nostalgia for the future?  What else can you show me?

and I'm not at all excited about Watten's FRAME but am looking much
forward to BAD HISTORY

several folks have asked fr pointers to anthologies, and i think that
points up part ov the problem.  the richest source of visual poetry
activity continues to be micropress (outside ov th acadamy) and mailart--
these communities (partly by design, partly by poverty) don't often
produce work in commodifiable products like anthologies or symposia
(kudos to th couple ov recent such that have appeared--but those are
exceptions proving th rule...).
                                   altho i much appreciate even the
existance of Marjorie's class attention to vizpo, i'm sympathetic to
bob g's underlying complaint: that seemingly whole bodies of work, whole
community(s) of visual poets, seem not to garner deserved attentions.
bob has long been a champion and advocate of several such bodies, and
i'm sure the reading list triggered some longstanding & justified
frustration  (L=A=N=Gpo's might be likewise sympatico to a percieved
exclusion by a  dominant aesthetic...).
                                        JM Bennett's Lost&Found Times
could usefully be examined as a locus of one particular body of work/
community of workers, which includes visual poetry as one among several
tactics in it's aesthetic--the continued lack of critical attentions to
that work is a source of endless personal puzzlement & frustration (i wont
even get into stories abt the Ohio Arts Council Literature panel meetings
considering his grantproposals)..
                                    hard fr me to believe this thread,
actually--as if marjorie's class somehow marks the cannonization of some
visual poets to th exclusion of others...  please dont tell malok!

Well, I read Frame, and Imagination Verses, and Lisa Jarnot's Some Kind
of Mission, and Tim Dlugos' selected, and Jim Brodey's Heart of the
Breath (or was that last year), among numerous others.  Also Bill Luoma's
cowboy poems come to mind.

I like the new Dylan alright, I thought that Good as I been and World
Gone wrong were his best work since who knows when, and I like the only
Xtian album of his I've listened to, Slow Train Coming, spiritual music
being as much a part of the tradition he has always been mining as blues
or rock or whatever.  I am waiting for a CD with George Jackson, another
of my favorite Dylan tunes, and perhaps, since at one point (I think
Allen Ginsberg pointed this out) he was mining the Auden/Spender vein, a
Dylan sings Cole Porter album would be amusing.

And for you gender and cultural studies etc people out there, Gail
Hershatter's DANGEROUS PLEASURES (study of prostitution in Shanghai,
published by U of California) is a masterpiece and worth everyone's time.

When I observed that I was disappointed that Marjorie Perloff had
chosen Charles Bernstein for a reading to kick off her graduate seminar
in visual poetics, I didn't think I was being "dismissive."  I just
thought it'd be nice if she picked someone who's been active in the
field longer than Bernstein and who could use a career boost a lot
more than he.  (And there are a lot of California poets in her area,
many of them equal to Finlay and Phillips, who'd certainly be available
for little of no reading fee.)  I didn't say anything about her seminar
as a whole because I didn't know anything about it.  Now that I've seen
Perloff's list of required and recommended books (with only one book on
it that's also on the CORE list I supplied), I AM dismissive of
her seminar.  Yes, it's nice that she's doing SOMETHING for visual
poetry, but a shame that she's doing so little for contemporary American
visual poetry.

*** Georgia gov. proposes infant music giveaway

Gov. Zell Miller proposed Tuesday the state provide the parents of
every Georgia newborn - some 100,000 a year - with a classical music
cassette or compact disc in order to boost the infant's intelligence
later in life. Miller proposed a $105,000 allocation for the program
in a $12.5 billion budget proposal that he presented to the General
Assembly. He cited a study of the "Mozart effect," which he said
showed college students' IQ scores increased after listening to a
Mozart piano sonata for 10 minutes. Miller said he had asked Atlanta
Symphony Conductor Yoel Levi to help select music for the recordings.

Eryque Gleason writes about visual poetry found at the Light & Dust website:

" Some of it's a little quirky and looks like advertisement-style art, but
all of it's interesting."

Advertisers picked up (co-opted!) the textual/graphic/spatial potentials
found in the exploratory practice of poets from the 20's onward to the
present, keeping the visual aspects while dropping the poetry. Visual poets
are still waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to Madison Avenue.

Two other sources for visual poetry in the U.S. are Marvin Sackner's
archive in Miami Beach (voluminous, The Poetry/Rare Books Collection at
University of Buffalo (Thanks to Mike Basinski and Robert Bertholf).

The ability to generate talk and interest is not all that indicative of
seriousness. If it were there would be fewer US magazines on the newsstands
and more literary magazines.

Or to put it another way: Virgin Records stores would be bulging with Paul
Bley CDs, and in one little corner there would be a few Spice Girls and Bob
Dylan CDs.

Some months ago a few queries were posted on the group enquiring about
Charles Nicholl's excellent biography of Rimbaud (mainly on Rimbaud in
Africa), titled Somebody Else", published by Jonathan Cape in the UK.

As the editor of Jacket magazine, free on the internet at
     http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/index.html

modesty forbids my mentioning that there is a detailed review of Mr
Nicholl's book, with many charming and previously obscure photographs,
including a Rimbaud self-portrait, at

     http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket03/rimbaud03.html

So, as we say Down Here in the Antipodes, go for it.

Lately, as well as Nicholl's book, I've enjoyed reading Douglas Rothchild's
"Match Book" (Situation Press # 13)(a giant matchbook full of poems, and
yes, you can light a match on the black strip on the cover -- don't try
this at home!)
... and Jennifer Moxley's  "Imagination Verses" (Tender Buttons)
... and Peter Riley's "Snow has Settled [...] Bury Me Here" (Shearsman
Books, Plymouth, UK.)

Is Visual Poetry visual or verbal?  The recent flurry here actually raises
an important issue I think.  Does visual poetry have a visual/auditory bias?
Would Bernstein's work not be poetic visuals?
   "Cocteau has said of his drawing that it is writing untied and 'knotted up
again in a different way.'" - Davenport.  I find that my work can be 'verbal',
'visual' or both, but all three are different in a fundamental way.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Although I understand the urge, given the time remaining to any of
us under the realm of capital, Watten's FRAME deserves, I think, far more
than a cursory read. He's always been something of an ambivalent figure,
if powerfully so, for me, at least until recently--crucially insightful,
full of new poetic possibilities, and with a more accurate and
consistently direct take on the material interests that shape our present
world than almost anyone I can think of, yet at the same time a rather
distant (should I say cold?) and perhaps even majestic presence--I
learn from his work always, but do I always like it, and would he even
want me to "like" it, exactly? Yes, I guess, but in
the way one likes a bracing shock. I remember once visiting Thomas
Jefferson's home at Monticello and being told that he woke up every
morning, at 6 a.m., by rolling out of bed and sticking his feet in a
bucket of ice water. Watten's work has always had something of a similar
effect on me.

        But while I had read a fair amount of his work, it was always in
smaller pieces--a book here one year, a book here the next, as they became
available. FRAME I think makes the case for a much larger reach in his
practice, and for its not always immediately apparent variability. Indeed
I even saw breeches in the wall of his social critique--I don't mean in
terms of its shortcomings, but in terms (despite the fact that "the
conditions of our displacement are functionally exact"--I paraphrase) of
where the critique is related to some of his own experiences, however much
those experiences are not in any direct manner the subject of his
practice. Oddly enough perhaps, or not, read again his work did not seem
particularly radical in terms of syntax or the construction of the
sentence--it's in terms of the relation BETWEEN sentences and a
disorientation on the level of the IMAGE that he strikes me as doing what
had not been done before. Less immediately materialist than Silliman, and
without the playfulness of Bernstein (humor is there in Watten, but it
always hurts), his work has more of a disorienting house of mirrors
effect, and seems less certain of the usefulness of its own critique (in
certain ways, at least) than one might expect. I was left wondering about
the value of critique in a world conditioned on our own displacement--it
remains for Watten perhaps the primary mode with which to engage the world
and challenge the forces of alienation, but what had one gained exactly
beyond the feeling that one knew where one had been lost? In short, if
there is an icy majesty to the tone always, it is one that comes out of a
sense of social tragedy (my word, not his own, who knows whether he'd like
it) that both must and cannot be repaired. Critique from the point of a
wound, caused not by the fact that one has withdrawn from the world, but
that the world itself as we are given it TODAY has withdrawn from us, into
a place where capitalist discipline threatens engagement, poetry, and the
most basic kinds of contact.

        As The Minutemen once said, maybe partying will help.

Josh's tres cynical remarks re the latest Dylan reminded me of an exchange I
had with Ben Friedlander awhile back. I'd commented that, say 1969 and
thereabouts, I'd found Clark Coolidge's work impenetrable (and had not yet
learned to trust opacity as a sign in and of itself) until Barrett Watten
pointed out to me the great humor in the work, a humor that, once mentioned,
became immediately evident to someone who'd read lots of Jonathon Williams
and Phil Whalen, two major Coolidge influences.

To paraphrase Ben, he said that that won't work if you come to Whalen after
you do Coolidge, which is of course correct. But I am in this sense part of
an indentifiable generation, someone who came to poetry when Creeley's For
Love was "the current book," as was Duncan's Opening of the Field, etc. etc.
Whalen was in those days still a "small press" poet, i.e. impossible to find
before On Bear's Head other than in journals. The objectivists out of print
entirely.

What comes before comes in unequal and sequentially disordered "lumps" of
information -- I get to HD, for example, years before I do Riding (Jackson),
thanks to Duncan. Crane and Keats are contemporaries, etc. But everything
that occurs after the mid-60s generally occurs in the order in which it came
into print and that becomes the skeleton of memory over time, onto which the
rest gets hung.

In somewhat the same way I will always be someone who "hears" Dylan as
someone who has (as he did when I first got into the music) just two albums
out and everything else is thus a development. It's in that sense that I
hear Josh's comments as possible only from someone whose parents (as Josh
has pointed out) are my age.

I had a similar experience reading FRAME. Other than the title piece itself,
I have everyone of the works that went into it and have a deep personal
experience of having read each -- some of the early This Press books with
their saddle staple binding were deeply sensuous volumes. Beautiful as their
covers may be, I don't think anybody would ever accuse the squat format and
too-small typeface that characterizes Sun & Moon press as "sensuous." Anyway
I'm very glad those works are in print because I think everybody should read
and know those poems deeply, but it was an odd experience going through them
in what seemed to me an alien format.

something substantive to say; I do remember that it's first-rate..)

mentioned books, but didn't seem to have much to say about 'em.

I've just published a review of Aldon's Stepping Razor.  Basically, it
points out that the strength of the book lies in its wide range of
approaches to form; and that that formal restlessness is quite effective,
and tied to a playful/intricate take on moments in our current unanchored
cultural life...Also on representative moments scooped out of history and
related to fragged bits of contemporary consciousness.  Ahem, "Nielsen
grasps the poem as a congeries of possible formal directions, which pique
the mind through ear and eye; music that thinks.  Furthermore it thinks in
American..." I hint in the review that Aldon's work is puzzling because
there are fewer direct lines of tension and connection than you might
expect between his poems and his extraordinarily important critical books.
They're there, but subtle.  I have this vague feeling they may grow
clearer as his work progresses...

Well, as I was sitting here typing this Mark W's post on Watten came
through.  A bit spooky, or an indication of great minds running on tracks.
I did a series of notes on the bus this morning to post about Frame, which
I've been looking at for a couple of months...Mark and I have mentioned
many of the same things: the aloof coldness in Watten (that neither of us
is exactly put off by, but there is some ambivalence there, from the way
we both mention it).  The fact that much of Frame is not as syntactically
disjunct as one remembers from when some of these books first came out.
That much of it is essentially New-sentence writing, working with tensions
generated by spaces and shifts between sentence structures...but (as Mark
says very accurately) "less materialist" than Ron S.  I was going to say,
less abruptly aware of the physical/social matrix of writing.

Like Mark I like Watten's work very much, and find it *useful* (to the
ear, nerve-ends, political mind and also to my own writing).  A few other
jottings from the bus:  Essentially Watten has a great ear and creates
stuff that (at times) swings like Stein or Coolidge--admittedly it is more
cerebral.  For you music analogy types (hey, Mike) more Anthony Braxton
than Mingus.  Geometric passion.  Actually I recommend reading his
Impercipient Lecture with Frame :  there is much the same (cold but real)
drive toward a truth articulated in sound-forms through time and writing
(that's an allusion...)  And I jotted down this:  Watten uses different
frames and musical phrases to offend the mind and wake up the ear, and
always underlying it is a fury about the political semi-conscious.  That's
a play on Fred Jameson and not a bad turn of phrase even if I do say so
myself.  It occurs to me now that many of us who have something in common
with Watten (such as Mark and myself) are tryng to write about "the
political semi-conscious"....The challenge being that in the realm of
public culture and political struggle our entire society right now is in a
state of semi-consciousness (at best).  Coma?

I also hoped to take up another suggestion people threw out: to discuss
Mark's own Nothing Happened (which I've been reading in conjunction with
his recent chapbook In Case of Damage to Life, Limb or This Elevator).
After all this other yattering I don't have time.  Except to note that
it's illuminating to look at both of them in light of Mark's comments
about Frame--not due to direct influence, but because there are parallels
in his concerns about how poetic form relates to politics and
consciousness.  He is getting increasingly political I feel, in an
increasingly interesting way, noticeable over these books and in his work
Temporary Worker Rides a Subway, bits of which are running in a kind of
serial fashion in my magazine Misc. Proj.  (Still working at getting the
new issue out to folks...Hang in there, it'll only be a couple more days!)

Joining two recent threads, I'd like to announce a new collection of essays
on the relationship between acoustical technologies and 20th century
innovative poetics.  The collection's 12 essays focus on earplay in texts
by Joyce, Pound, H.D., Beckett, Burroughs, Baraka, Kaufman, Duncan and
Brathwaite and performances by Cage, Laurie Anderson,Caribbean DJ poets and
Cecil Taylor.  Contributers are Loretta Collins, Jim Connor, Michael
Davidson, Kate Hayles, Nate Mackey, Steve McCaffery, Alec McHoul and Toby
Miller, Dee Morris, Fred Moten, Marjorie Perloff, Jed Rasula, and Garrett
Stewart.  But the best thing--in my humble opinion--is that there's a CD
slipped in the back cover which makes it possible to hear not only F. T.
Marinetti, H.D., Henri Chopin, Anthony McNeill, Brathwaite, and others, and
but also Mississippi Fred McDowell, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Rahsaan
Roland Kirk, and Cecil Taylor.  The title is Sound States: Innovative
Poetics and Acoustical Technologies.  Edited by me.  Available from North
Carolina University Press and (I hope) good bookstores everywhere.

I find Ron's comments fascinating...I think we all have some experience we
can remember, of how sequence in time effected our reception of a poet or
a bunch of poetry....I'm not sure it usually has a significant impact on
how good we think the stuff is (which I take it is partly going on in the
episode of discovering Coolidge's humor, in relation to Whalen...)

Certainly this probably has happened to a lot of people: at 14 and 15 I
discovered fairly derivative works that blew me away; they were part of
the process of working backward to the poets/books that had influenced
*them*.  But a bit of my consciousness will always see the later poets as
*precursors* because I encountered 'em first (and at a time when I was
just discovering poetry).

Baraka's first two books (Preface to a 20 volume suicide note; and Dead
Lecturer...note the morbid note that was appealing to an adolescent) I
encountered before the Duncan and Olson that gave Baraka so many of his
formal ideas.

and:

A poet not much known I think to our crowd, but at his best underrated: I
read Thomas Merton's two best works, Geography of Lograire and Cables to
the Ace before the Cantos, which they (especially Geography) are largely a
response to (formally speaking).

Likewise, Dylan's Tarantula (to get back to Dylan) introduced me to
stylistic pyrotecnics from a whole range of sources I only read later:
Rimbaud, Burroughs, Ginsburg.

The one thing about this dynamic (it can be argued) is that one may
permenantly over-value the false precursors, because they helped program
certain poetry-receptors in one's head.  Or to change metaphors: the
reader imprints on them (term in biology for a young animal becoming
attched to a nurturing presence in its environment, whether its actual
parent or no).

Mark,

Thank you for the wonderful post on FRAME 1970-1990.  I have been reading
FRAME since it came out and have tried to organize my responses into some
coherent form, but you have pulled these responses considerably ahead.

My history as a reader is different from yours, and completely opposite
that of Ron's, but probably resembles that of many latecomers (latecoming
dabblers, eh Bob G?) to language writing.  While I read a lot of Bernstein
and Silliman's work in book form, Watten's poetry was available to me in
1980s North Carolina solely through the major anthologies (In the American
Tree etc.) Still amazing stuff ("Complete Thought" especially) with a
specific feel that seemed different from other language writing.  I was
more struck by the impression of intelligence and plan, by the ambition,
and by the purity of language.  Basically, I could tell something
extraordinary was going on, but I couldn't get what it was.  (I had a
similar experience with my first reading of the later poetry of Thomas
Kinsella, who I have since come to think of as one of the great living
poets.  But I'm almost alone in that assessment.)

Back then I a better sense of Watten's criticism.  Probably my first real
encounter with him in this vein was as a respondent to that Bernstein
lecture "Characterization" (in Content's Dream) where he tells CB to
"purge your vocabulary of statements like 'French linguistics from
Saussure to Derrida.'"  That gave me a feel for his take-no-prisoners
attitude, which I have always admired.

I _did_ read Total Syntax around 1990, which struck me at the time as
overwhelmingly intelligent but bizarre/forbidding, jargon-wise, and kind
of interestingly obsessive.  It _did_ give me an inroad into Coolidge and
others.

So Frame is only my second encounter with Watten's poetry in book form
(after Progress, which I again encountered after everybody else).  I have
been reading it chronologically rather than in the order of the book,
alongside the great Watten issue of Aerial.  I agree with Ron about the
typeface, but I have to say this is one of the major reading experiences
of my adult life.  I'm not sure what will come of it.

Cheers,
David

Definitely _Imagination Verses_ -- which I am very happy to have received.
From the comments at the time I'd have to believe that more than five of us
have read it. And Mark is right to mention Rochelle Owens' _New and
Selected Poems, 1961-1996_, and yes, I thought a lot of Aldon Nielsen's
_Stepping Razor_. Not to mention Joe Amato's _Symptons of a Finer Age_. I
havent read the most recent David Bromige, so hang my head in shame, but I
have it on the shelf. Am right now immersing myself in Sheila E. Murphy's
wonderful _Falling Love, Falling in Love, with You Syntax_.

I wont mention the Canadian books...

Why dont we 'talk' about them? Is it easier to rave aout Dylan (or, say,
for me, Van Morrison [or, more importantly, because I really listen more to
jazz & 'classical': the latest Jessica Williams or a finally found copy of
a terrific Ben Webster re-released on CD]) because the music, the playing,
as well as the lyrics, the performance that is, is there for us to engage,
while I may never hear some of these poets (I do think we get that kind of
enjoyment/rave response in some of the 'reviews' of live readings...

i never intend to be snide... and tho i know you originally addressed
only the reading series, the discuss on th list had amorphed into a
critique of the course as a whole, based only on that reading series;
so i felt the syllabus was a needed corrective....

i ov course agree w/ your thrust, as i understand: that a whole raft
of important work ("our" kinds ov stuff) are by&large excluded frm
serious consideration...  no surprize (tho no less a travisty) when
norton & vendelar dismiss it/us; and even more irking when individs
whom we had hoped shared our aim of extending th canonical bounds
continue to draw those territorial maps w/out a trace of our own
valued continents...

so she's addressing seriously a body ov work previously excluded, that's
good; so she's still not addressing a body ov work that we believe is
worthy, that's bad.  always too easy, fr me, to find fault w/ what
someone's _not_ doing.
                        all in all, tho, i dont thingk she shd necessarily
be faulted fr failing to give poet xxx a deserved career boost--i'd be
critical of any project which took, as it's goal, "giving deserving poets
carreer boosts"...  altho TRR might as do that for some folks as a side
benefit, it certainly isnt our editorial purpose; likewise its not (&,
i think, ought not be) the purpose of a professor or a poetics program
or a publisher--rather it ought be to desemination of important work,
and of understanding of that work...
                                      and, all that being said, it
might be yr perception that the particular slant of mp's class is in fact
more ov to boost the cultural capital of some particular poetic community
or aesthetic...  i'm not sure that's incorrect.  but th arguement then
would be to identify the underlying aesthetic structure she's promoting
and either: (z) challange the value or importance of that particular body
ov work; (x) identify other excluded works/poets who should be considered,
on the basis of their sharing those concerns & producing  work of equal or
better value; or (y) identify other aesthetics or tendencies beyond the
narrowly definded trends already being considered, identify their
distinguishing characteristics, and show their value...

or maybe we shd each work on getting out our next publication...

I found Mark Wallace's and Ron Silliman's comments about Watten to be of
great interest.  Recently, in preparing for an essay I was writing about
Watten's poetry, I read all of his published work intensively over the period
of about 2/3 weeks.  So my experience of coming to Watten's books would, I
suppose, be diametrically opposite to Silliman's.  But what struck me then
was the extraordinary correspondence between the essays and the poems -- not
that the poems really fulfill the project laid out (to some extent) in the
essays (Bob Perelman, for instance, is very good at pointing out the way in
which, as Mark Wallace says, Watten's "critique is related" in a strange way
"to . . . his own experiences" -- but that both the essays and the poems
deliberately withold, in much the same way, an immediate legibility and
aesthetic pleasure.  Mark Wallace writes: "Oddly enough perhaps, or not, read
again his work did not seem particularly radical in terms of syntax or the
construction of the sentence--it's in terms of the relation BETWEEN sentences
and a disorientation on the level of the IMAGE that he strikes me as doing
what had not been done before."  The same thing can be said I think of the
essays. Though they're not by any means written in the "composition as
explanation" style that characterizes L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, there is a somewhat
abstract *accretion* of verbal material in Watten's essays (an influence of
Robert Smithson's?) which is a bracing preparation for the poems.  (This of
course is truer of the essays in *Total Syntax* than Watten's recent, more
academic work, though certainly not in any absolute sense.)  In any case,
although I loved *Frame* I missed the essays -- an ideal presentation of
Watten's work would, I think, reveal their remarkable imbrication.

Ron's Guantanamero narrative mirrors somewhat my own relationship with
this tune.  Coming from an English, soccer (nee football) background, I
*only* knew this sing through its very popular use as a "There's only one
[insert player's name/team name here]" style terrace chant.  Sometimes
this pattern would be altered, my favourite example being when Liverpool
FC signed a defender by the name of Jimmy Carter -- hence, "There's only
two Jimmy Carters, / Two Jimmy Carr-terrrs!"

On holiday in Spain some years ago I remarked to a friend, "Oh, listen,
someone's made a song out of that football chant!"  A chastening moment
indeed. . .

that's actually what i was referring to.  there are a few images there
that contain just a couple words, and these few words are not enough to
make me think of poetry.

I approach Watten similarly to Jacques Debrot in the sense that I was really
introduced to his work via FRAME. Anticipating the "critique relation"
problem, I promptly ordered a copy of the AERIAL issue devoted to Watten,
which works as an essential companion to FRAME.

"You are inside a building and then outside it." p.295

Often, without knowing it, you read a poem and you find yourself in an
already constructed network of comprehension. The shadow in which labor,
life and language conceal their truth. Less often, in full realization, you
read a poem and find yourself somewhere completely different, where the
shadow is of each letter in the poem, language exposed, a sentence in giant
block letters across the top of a building. Communication model as neon sign
blinking on and off like whatever the sun cuts in half with its light or
signification without the sun (or "Sun cuts throat."). The later reading
would be for Barrett Watten's FRAME.
FRAME  questions not literature itself, as it appears and works in the text,
but what makes language possible as a force for the systematically reduced
mind. Watten's real politick is not feeling or representing your pain, but
rather seeing it in language and defamiliarizing it as mush as possible . It
is not poetry in search of a utopian socialist movement, but rather, an
expulsion from the imaginary.

For Watten, to perceive while being-in-the-world is to struggle in the most
political sense to the point of high organization at times. In other words,
Watten organizes language in a political fashion, though not nearly as
adroitly as it may sound. This writing settles on you like so many days,
like so many streets that you've walked a thousand times. The play of
signification often associated with L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry turns out to be a
disaster haunted by history, and like history, as easily mis-read as it is
imitated.

Look at the grid formed by the windows of a building you work in, these
fragments we have framed against our ruins, instead of shored.. For Watten,
imagination disappears with the first line of each poem to a historical
framework that must configure in and out of history or be lost only to be
shored or stifled. Watten's unimagination is not a lack of imagination; it
is not even imagination of the lack, but rather that which is hidden by
imagination and what is given alike: the neutral, the unmanifest. (Blanchot
,WOD p.63).

As a book FRAME is proof that a frame is never axiomatic, but rather,
"constant, altered only by our design." Oddly enough, Watten's work does
bear a axiomatic quality, his sentences read and sometimes progress like
axioms in a mathematic or logical sense.

In repressive society the concepts of life, labor and language are
themselves parodies of fantasies that involve a denial of objective historic
forces.

"Dreams are our life, which we will never be able to penetrate. There can be
no separation from an invisible world." _CITY FIELDS_

The fabulous _Sound States: Innovative Poetics and Acoustical Technologies_
which Dee just announced will be on the next Bridge Street list (coming soon)
with lots of other excitin' new books. & of course the curried favor of the
discount might sway listmembers to order it from Bridge Street.

On the Dylan thread, I'm with Simon-- World Gone Wrong and Good As I Been To
You which are two solo acoustic  records recorded in the early nineties (all
blues and folk covers) are likely the most interesting post-70s Dylan, tho
the new record is certainly worthwhile, particularly for the 14 minute cut
"Highlands."

On the Watten thread, pick up Frame & "Start anywhere."
Interesting that people would characterize the work as "cold." Watten's work
always seemed to mean a kind of descriptive conceptual art, which would imply
a purposeful distancing, tho it doesn't seem cold to me.
Hope we'll see Progress & Under Erasure back in print soon as well.

a good question, and one which underscores something i think miekal and
said earlier about how the "visual poetry" rubric (like all
classifications) collects a diverse set of works whose boundaries,
definition-wise, are frayed / aside from the obvious, that letters refer
both graphically and phonemically, what do we call--if necessary--a writing
that *means* both visually and verbally, or that commits to exercising in
both fields--things you both read and look at? / or is that the distinction
that creates the problem / the term i've come up with is "graphonemantic"
but i'm sure Bob G. has something better to pull from his taxonomy grabbag?!

Yeah, Luigi, I meant SLY, not SNIDE ("And that snide insert of yours,
with Perloff's list of required and recommended books on it was
beautiful!")  Sorry.

I mostly agree with what you said.  I guess if Marjorie Perloff had
called her seminar The Use of Visual Devices in Language Poetry, I
wouldn't have been bothered--except that I would still be annoyed that
she wasn't covering what I consider our kind of visual poetry.

I DO think people setting up seminars and the like should try to pass
out career boosts if they can choose between equally qualified people,
some of whom could use such a boost, some of whom don't need one.

As for your zxy, I'm not up to (z) challenging "the value or importance
of that particular body (that Perloff is pushing)"--I admit I don't know
enough about it to do so; and also that some of it I quite like.
I go with part of (x) "identify(ing) other excluded works/poets who
should be considered" and part of (y), sort of, in that I would want
to say why the excluded are aesthetically worthy of consideration--
"identify their distinguishing characteristics, and show their value..."

That's what I try to do with my too infrequent essays.

Okay, that's it--except that I ought to let the list know that I'm
friends with Harry Burris (I think!) and he knows that I consider his
definition of visual poetry too broad (for including wholly averbal
collages) and doesn't mind.

Well, I agree with Ron that generational differences result in extremely
different receptions of what is "new".  When I read TJANTING a few years
ago, it was wonderfully new to me in a way that, right now, Watten's FRAME
is not.  I spent some time thinking about Watten's Impercipient Lecture,
rather put-off by the so-called "take-no-prisoners" attitude, especially
with respect to the motor industry that gives Detroit a constant hum.
Take-no-prisoners sounds like Mr.  Ford's can-do American spirit
ripping-off every worker's life strength.  What about Ford's anti-Semitic
pamphlets, pre-dating WWII and just as idiotic as any other Nazi propaganda?
The influence of Ford is bigger than Watten's pamphlet wants to address.
Good thing GM head Roger Smith takes-no-prisoners, as if prisoners equals
non-profitable workers.  On second thought, Smith does take
prisoners, as seen in ROGER & ME.  To me, "take-no prisoners" and cultural
poetics are complete opposite modes of understanding.

For all Watten's brio grand, he doesn't strike me as the most sensitive
reader who can propose a cultural poetics.  He seems to pose such a
poetics in *opposition* to other current notions of poetics, as if
opposition is the situation of a sensitive reader (who would be more
curious and inventive than a "close reader").  Watten rips out the
rug from other positions, and as exciting as that is, as much as I am
convinced by his lecture, I don't want to move ahead with any sense of
"I'm against this and against that."  That's what many academic critics
do.  That's what the evil Hal Foster, for example, does.  That's cynical.

I don't feel cynical at all, which may mean I have a problem.  There is an
abundance of wonderful writing being produced, even today, or what seems
like today to me.  Of course, even if I buy a book 20 years old, it is
still very news to me.  When I first heard about a store like SPD, I was
overwhelmed.  The catalogue of new books made no sense; every text was new
and as far as I was concerned they all needed a blurb.  So I decided to
intern at SPD for a summer, and I spent most of my time just finding out
what books were there, treating the store more like a library.

I'm not cynical about Dylan either, although nostalgia seems to be the
word we attribute to older people that corresponds to cynicism in the
youth.  Those two terms are also two of the biggest cash-cows for the
entertainment market place, most music and movies falling under one of the
two categories.

Ron and Jeff Derkson's recent Philly Talks is new to me, especially Ron's
second letter to Jeff, as much a tour-de-force in its own, briefer way as
Watten's ILS. Ron asks why there has been no new movement in poetry
similar to the energy and community created during the early 70's.
Certainly there has been several new movements in culture, especially in
film and music, but Ron does not feel much of the recent work by younger
poets "is actually new."  This seems a bit too cynical to me, and would
surely be attacked by almost any young writer.  But I'm not interesting in
the poetics and politics of attack and oppose, critique and defy.

Cultural poetics cannot take place until, as Ron knows, we further
understand what culture today exhibits and demands from us.  But I also
think that take-no-prisoners poetics is more ripping than truly opening
up.  Not that everyone has to be neat and nice.  There are several
contemporary and important historical poets who bore me constantly.  I
found a beat up copy of Coolidge's SPACE first edition from 1970 and I
can't make much sense of it at all and I don't find it all that funny.  I
need another hint or clue at reading Coolidge before I can find it
interesting.  Dare I say I feel the same boredom when I read Stein (What
are the politics of boredom?).  Oh well, but there isn't a sentence by,
say, Dodie Bellamy that I don't think is both very intense and intimate.
One can still be a sensitive reader without being cynical, or needing to
take-no-prisoners, or liking everything.

Yes, I read "Frame."  And found it thoroughly satisfying, though I struggled to
grasp the context out of which the earliest parts of it were written.
So that makes two of us.

you talkin to me?  my last post had 2 "important"s & 1 "importance"
(nice homophones, eh?), which was maybe two many...  but it also
had a couple of "valuable" or "value"s, and a "useful" (as well as
a "worthy" & a handful of "deserving"s)....   so i'm not sure if yr
suggesting a stylistic improvement in my un-rigerous prose (a
spelling dictionary might be th higher priority), or if yr directive
to me is to avoid making value judgements about the importance/
value/use of works...  i'd hate to artificially impoversh my already
meager vocabulary w/out understanding why you think it's important
to do so...

When I hit the sentence you cite, it reminded me of Buckminster Fuller's
comment that "A structure is something with an inside and an outside.
Period," which could itself be a precis of the Heart Sutra, one of the
core texts of Mahayana Buddhism, which is really just quantum physics, but
I digress spectacularly. Along with the pleasure-of-the-text of
reading Watten, I find him excellent for helping me realize/remember the
constructed, vs. received, nature of textual spaces as well as
"real"space. I like the polysemy of the title FRAME and the way it brings
in photographic/filmic presences--and reminds that those spaces are
constructed as well.

If the boundaries are really frayed - would you include poetry that
directs its attention to actual works of visual art under this rubric?

_Loose Sugar_ is intriguing Hillman. Retaining, as Patrick Pritchett says, a
backbone of traditional narrative, _Loose Sugar_ is a continuation of the
journey Brenda Hillman began in _Death Tractates_ and _Bright Existence_,
except that there is clearly an enaction of her earlier experience with the
fragment that doesn't take place in the linear narrative of her earlier books.
Here, form and content appear to match up well. This seems especially true in
the poems of "time / space," where she recalls her Brazilian childhood
effectively in fragments of found language, remembered conversation, and
quotation in a manner somewhat reminiscent of the novels of Carole Maso.
Perhaps she hints toward what she purposes by writing,

I have doubted my belief in sentences because
of their refusal to recall certain things

and

"To think" means: the looseness is taken away.

What strikes me is how she has incorporated, indeed reconciled modern science
into her gnostic world view with its disjunction between spirit and matter.
Travelling through loose matter with all the ease and speed of a neutrino, she
finds a way to use the sound, if not the meaning, of the names of the twelve
fundamental particles of matter in "The Particles." Is the high-energy particle
a metaphor here for the quick trip of the gnostic soul through matter? Perhaps,
but the short lifetime of these particles notwithstanding, Brenda Hillman's
time in "problem / time " is the slow time of careful contemplation.

My favorite section of _Loose Sugar_ is the poems in the cylcle called "blue
codices." The brief snatches, fragments below each poem in the series are
largely personal and act more as signposts than stage-by-stage narrative. They
appropriately end the cyle with an ellipsis. It seem "blue codices" is a
journey of the self on the way toward healing, toward change where the stops
along the way, like the means, are more important than the end. The poet
wonders,


And if at the end of healing there is nothing?


Finally, we read,

When I gave up hope of being complete,
the sorrow deepened.
As that went too, a mystery replaced it.


And her despair gives way to open space: to science, the mystery of the
alchemist with which she seems perfectly satisfied.

I've just received in the mail a new Tom Beckett book, Wagers of
Synthesis, from Zasterle.

I strongly recommend this little book if you haven't seen it.  Strikes me
as relevant too, because we've been discussing Frame, and there are
certain interesting parallels.  The problematic nature of language and
ideas in a context where the dominant culture has emptied them of urgent
referentiality.  (The one radically "unreadable" section of Wagers is two
pages that repeat "How do normal people BLANK?" about 200 times; the rest
of the book is much more fun than that, but it gives a feeling of how
Beckett is sometimes banging his head in a kind of witty rage against
alienated and unexamined forms of usage.) I really like Beckett's ear and
the way his words move.  I've recently been reading a friend's copy of
Invisible Aria, a Beckett chapbook from Burning Press (1990)--If it is
still available or you can find it I very strongly recomment that one too.
Wagers is a development of the same set of concerns....

Thanks Josh for this very engaging and insightful - what? - intervention I
guess; I think in some way or another you're speaking for many of the
yungins (not to be confused with Jungians) on this list.  Can't say I
agree with your dis of Ms. Stein particularly, but I think there's
something about you're basic approach to the issue of value which I feel
very close to - which is to say, there's a difference it seems to me in
the approach to history and tradition, a less Bloomian take on innovation
which doesn't ask, or even really allow, questions such as, "Where are the
great schools of the new?  Breakers of the tablets?" etc; and, yes, this
may partly be the result of a childhood spent learning how to deconstruct
Ford commercials ("This Taurus is the newest of the newest new new
sedans!" etc) as well as college education in the years of cultural
studies (learning about things like Ford's anti-Semitic pamphlets which, a
few decades ago, would have seemed arcane and irrelevant vis a vis poetry
to be sure).  But the most important thing you point to, to my mind, is a
difference in how poets born post-Watergate, or nearly so (I was 3-4),
approach the idea of "bigness."  I feel, and I swear I don't mean to be
condescending here, its just an observation, that the baby boomers - on
the left, right, middle, and however "radical," though of course with many
exceptions - still deeply love the grand narrative, and, as such,
narrative itself - one such narrative involves answering the question,
"Where is the next great movement?"  I think its a bogus question and, in
any event, not the one we should be asking.  In a world which is
increasingly diverse and complex, and where intellectuals are increasingly
banking on constructs involving multiculturalism, well, the next great
movement ain't coming, folks - or if it is we won't recognize it as such -
hey, maybe its already here.  I agree with Josh, too, that there's plenty
of great writing being done right now.  Doesn't Harryette Mullin's *Muse &
Drudge* stand up with any book of lyrics done in the last 30 yrs?  With
Creeley's *Pieces* or Levertov or Howe or whoever you want to name?  In
any event she's been just as important to me as those great writers and I
like her just as much, and she's as "original" as hell.  It's observations
such as this which make cynicism seem, well, a little nostalgic.

Regarding Tom Bell's question as to whether visual poetry is visual or
verbal, Bill Marsh said some thoughtful things, I think.  Then he come
up with a neology that I LOVE--because it's worse than almost anything
I've ever come up with!  (See what Marjorie Perloff's Seminar has done
to me.  I've become just . . . )

Actually, I'd never thought to describe a word or words intended to be
taken both semantically and visually--or, as Bill puts it, "writing that
*means* both visually and verbally, or that commits to exercising in
both fields--things you both read and look at?"  His term is
"graphonemantic."  Not really too bad.  I've been using simply
"visio-poetic" without thinking I was using a special term.  It would
seem a little more self-explanatory than Bill's.  "poetic" instead
of "phonemical" or "semantic" because the word would automatically
be poetic if it was significantly both verbal and visual since the
addition of the visual element would have to, it seems to me, make
it metaphoric; otherwise the visual element would be decorative only and
therefore not significant.

As for the different weights of the visual and the verbal in visual
poetry, my taxonomy gets into the difference between VISUAL poetry and
VISUALLY-ENHANCED poetry.  I consider ALL poetry primarily verbal,
including visual poetry.  When it stops being verbal it becomes a form
of illumagery (my term for visual art) I call textual illumagery--
usually letters that are visual interesting but not verbal.  As the
textuality of the piece fades further, we get textually-enhanced
illumagery.  Big controversy in taxonomy--at least among those who
give a blip about taxonomy, who are few--is whether what I call Textual
Illumagery is Visual Poetry.  I say no, personally, but will leave it
up to the consensus of informed participants in the field to decide.
When their number reaches double figures.

Henry Gould asks, "If the boundaries are really frayed (regarding the
classification of visual poetry)- would you include poetry that
directs its attention to actual works of visual art under this rubric?"

I, for one, would not, Henry.  I classify on what a poem does, not its
subject matter.  Similarly, for me a mathematical poem is a poem that
DOES math, not one that merely discusses something mathematical.

Related to this is the idea of calling a conventionaly textual poem
visual because it vividly calls up some visual image or scene.  No, it's
just a highly visually-expressive (sorry, George and Judy) textual
poem.

Hmmm, my previous post was a little silly at the end.  I said, "Related
to this is the idea of calling a conventional textual poem visual
because it vividly calls up some visual image or scene.  No, it's
just a highly visually-expressive (sorry, George and Judy) textual

visual."

I'm on digest (undigested?) so excuse me if this message is out of date and
far too long (my ondigestion has given me logorhea). But this is three
messages in one and I promise not to write in for three more years again!

1. VIZPO
Just a posting to say Charles Bernstein's  reading last night was
wonderful. Thank you very much. Quite the buzz (and the wine was okay too).
STanding room only.  It brought in folks from Berkeley, SF and Santa Cruz.
It brought together the Creative Writing and the English Departments (no
mean feat!) and the energy created was a terrific kickoff for this series
even if it doesn't meet the approved list of whose in the visual poetics
club. For the other vizpos in the bay area who are feeling neglected I say,
come on down!!  Introduce yourself. Have a glass of wine (on the house, or
farm, as it were). Join the party. (And remember to thank Craig Dworkin for
all his work too.)

I'm glad the viz po thread has turned into an actual discussion of poets
and works and what to read and where to find things.  This seems to be the
point of the series and the course and this discussion list. (Sob! Why
can't we all just get along?!) The petty attacks on critics and poets seems
sadly misplaced. But I'm a sucker for visions of communities, imaginary and
other/wise, which are usually fascist utopias I know I know.  It just
struck me that the tenor of the original postings was: How come MP isn't
doing enough for ME? Why indeed. Ask not what  . . . oh never mind. Well, I
too tend to have a knee-jerk defensive response when being told I could be
doing more when I'm in fact working my butt off for something. On the other
hand, controversy IS a sign of success.

2. LANGPO
I'm interested in why "language poet" seems to be a pejorative term on this
list.

3. ZIMCO
I too found it depressing that more people wrote in about bob dylan than
have regarding recent books of poetry. As for what Charles Bernstein
called, "the STanford Zimmerman conference,"  It is not surprising but it
is sad that this is the only event I've worked on that the national--and
international-- press has taken an interest in. But with billion dollar
corporations involved in making lots of money off of cd sales, etc. the
stakes are different. Talk about a CANONIZED writer! Nonetheless, I'm
really looking forward to what Aldon has to say, and granted Dylan's
important although he doesn't speak to me (except to say "change the
station away from this adult contemporary baby boomer big chill nostalgia
crap") I'd rather hear Beck. Or even Bowie. (Or Bernstein!)

            I remember 20 years ago or so, Ron Silliman and I had a wonderful
evening sitting at my kitchen table.  We were in our early thirties.  Now we are
among the grey-beards of the Poetics List.  This happens at a dizzying rate.

            If you have been paying attention, you realize you have reached
middle age not because your bones creak, which they do, but because you know
that you will never find another book or work or art that seems truly strange.

        When I was 16 or so, I saw _La Dolce Vita_ and about the same time
Seymour Krim's mass-market anthology _The Beats_ somehow came into my hands.
These made me a strangeness junky. There was a poem in anthology, very strange,
Dan Proper's "The Fable of the Final Hour." Does any one know what happened to
Dan Proper, or for that matter who he was?  As far as I know that one poem is
the only thing of his I ever saw.

         I can remember when Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Ornette Coleman, and
John Coltrane were strange.  John Cage was strange. Olson, Duncan, Ashbery,
O'Hara, and Dorn were strange.  Clark Coolidge and Bob Grenier were strange.
Chuck Stein and George Quasha's sound poetry was strange.  The art from New
Guinea in the Rockefeller Collection at the Met was strange.  This gets me up to
the 70s (I was 30 in 74).  Since then there have not been many surprises. Those
New Guinea people knocked me out.  Talking about an avant-garde. A few ideas
were strange: Eric Drexler's book on nanotechnology was strikingly odd.  I had
big hopes for hypertext, but it has yet to produce much of interest.

        It's not as exciting, but it is a relief.  You can begin to pay
attention to things that humans have always paid attention to.  In this
connection, it seems to me the most important book of 1997 was John Clarke's _In
the Analogy_.  It's a big, baffling, posthumous book like Emily Dickinson's
collected poems.  It's hard to make much of most of it the first time and
perhaps the second time you read it.  You need to read _From Feathers to Iron_,
and it helps to go through all of the issues of _Intent_, and then you need to
read most of the books that mentioned in those places as well as in _The
Curriculum of the Soul_....  You will need to read Blake, Melville, and Novalis
again, if you have read them once, to read them with Clarke's eyes.  It is a
great education, and you  begin to understand the depth and seriousness of the
calling of the poet.  You will begin to see what language can  do, if you  put
enough  pressure on it.

No matter who you are or where you are
in the world, no matter how much money
you have or how many hostages taken,
no matter what luxury and/oremergency
you're in, when you pick up the phone
you hear the same dial tone I hear
right here tonihgt, so who needs Death
to level us all out, is his voice more
common than the one we've known almost
as long, "whatcha doin?" You can hire
someone to push the buttons for you
so you never have to listen, but just
the same, isn't it better to bear this
unflaggin drone than her obscure echo?

To dupe --

I can't wait till I get to tell a poet twenty years younger than me that
they haven't done anything new --

all the generation that fought the second part of the 30 yrs war can say
is, how come those poets twenty years younger than my gang not only
couldn't do anything new, they couldn't come to anything like a
world-building -describing view --

this, btw, is what I meant by purge your vocabulary of the word "important" --

Overall Im struck that in many of our minds one phantasm of success is
if the work youve spent a lifetime creatingproducingnetworking is being
taught to others. it saddens me deeply that the radical samisdat &
unclassifiable experimedia remains as marginalized as ever, awaiting
some critic 50 years hence to reconstruct a useful history. there is no
zaum as far as Im concerned, before Gerald Janacek's remarkable work,
maybe no lettrism before the event of May 68.

One of the profound singularities of the international visual poetry
movement is that it is inclusive & truly international. its globalspeak
is in the the best intention's of Kruckenykh "trans-rational language" &
because of that new translation of the text & the page, I can
comfortably interact with artist's around the world.   via mailart
shows, assemblings, installations, anthologies, archives &
collaborations it invites your participation as a living art form.
while there is some institutional affiliations, it is largely composed
of independent artistpublishernetworkers living in isolation.  For
instance, one of my favorites, Serge Segay & Rea Nikonova, live in rural
Georgia, Russia in the Azov Mountains & up until a few years ago, I had
to send mail to someone who gave it to someone to deliver it.

my reaction when reading your reading list was largely "these are people
who I was unaware did visual work & I should remember to check em out".
what is the context here. the context is that Im someone who has been
living & breathing hypermedia poetry since I was 17, runs a press that
has published the books of 40 different visual poets in 15 different
countries, as well as combobulating an extensive library of my own
books, cassettes, & software.  (have a great video piece of me doing
Kruchenykh called EUY) & youre list was news to me.

Im supposed to be writing a text on visual poetry for the upcoming SCORE
& Im finding that this is the text Im trying to remember. ...how do we
as artist/publishers design a/many threshold(s) to our world(s) that
is/are accessible & commodifiable in institutionality. my instant
answer, being the html geezerwrecker that I am, is thru a catalogued &
searchable internet front, a website, a domain (memexadu.com) or a
virtual world, some sort of knowledge navigatable environment where
anyone could navigate around/inside of for a couple hours & feel awe for
the expanding internationality of visual poetry.

wish I could be there to sit in on your supposium, but I guess my track
record for keeping my mouth shut is not very good.  since Im too poor to
buy books & am more than a 100 miles from a decent library Id love to
trade books with you, & especially learn about your views on the
hyperculture world of experimental poetry.

Susan,

Thank you for your honest comments on Bob Dylan. Truth be told, I have =
never understood what anyone saw, or excuse me, heard in this man's "music.=
" But then, I also can't stand the beach boys, the rolling stones, nirvana,=
 frankie valli or any of that crap. It all sounds alike to me. I guess I =
don't understand the aesthetics of white male rock. It is not simpy =
displeasant to me. My response is completely somatic, as if my entire =
central nervous system is somehow allergic to those screeching and =
gravelly sounds that white male rock singers love to make. Perhaps, in =
some preconscious place, those sounds represent to me not angst but =
aggression; not celebration, but negation. Where does one hide within one'=
s own body when confronted with the terrifying cry of a Sammy Hagar or a =
whathisnamethatshothimselfinthehead (kojak?) as amplified to a menacing =
frequency through someone's beachblanket radio? Oh for a muse of fire give =
me the Ohio Players. Barry White. Isaac Hayes. These are the geniune poets.=
 (aside: funny that I don't shrink from the music of Elton John, Queen or =
Bowie. Perhaps because they're queer, something softens the tones of their =
voices. Maybe queer people don't make those sounds. Who knows?)

But finally, I should add I agree that the discussion of "popular" "music" =
is seems to be taking up a very large section of this picnic about poetry. =
Why? Is music feeding poetry? Is music our proverbial chicken and potato =
salad? I wonder....  =

Bob, I can appreciate the last sentence there from the point of view of acting
out, or performing/enacting the thing, rather than talking about it (which I am
not dismissing as viable either though). But when you say that the
mathematical/visual poem does math, how do you visualize this happening? Do you
mean this in the operational sense (in which case one runs into the abstract
immediately)?


Best,

William Burmeister

LIKE MUSIC AGAINST DREAM

The visual-verbal interface a target per se delivery of perception.
Collusions between all elementals, impartial sensing alphabet, symbols &
images as interchangeable.  The depth of affection counter to the
obscurity / coded.  Exposure as common, the districts of apprehension in
a mechanized perception, should they give rise to understanding, depend
on sensate imagination, conditioned as it is, or which truth within our
subjectivity do we trust, a choice once recorded as a decision, &
understanding becomes a function of bias.

Once our attention returns to the page, a new art becomes betrayed
following recognition/identification, that really familiarity replaces
reactions.

I am encountering unexpected sequence.  A page after page turning
coinciding with retentive effort.  In the course of a life time a
commonality of experience "arranges" understanding.

THE ACTS THE SHELFLIFE

The fortune of seeing, of the non-idiomatic, is probably a species away
from becoming the condition, our state now minutely distracted by
media/media & the experience of our selfsame art is unconscious.  Should
the design of being change, the capacity for a truer rendering of
non-idiomatic art is elevations above the posing which informs much of
the recent experimental interpretation.

            If you have been paying attention, you realize you have reached
middle age not because your bones creak, which they do, but because you know
that you will never find another book or work or art that seems truly

As a third graybeard, I second Don Byrd's firstrate rap re-zero-degree art
at 16. That stage was like the moment of learning to read all over again. I
have my own fave fetish-memories from that other life when I was alive (as
alice ordered me to be said).

But more pressing info : Dan Proper was (still is?) living nearby me in
Sonoma County for some years, one of a number of readers at one event I
attended. As a writer, & indeed a human being, he shared something with Wm
Faulkner, E Hemingway and Chas Bukowski. Where he is today, I can maybe
find out.

As for Bob Grenier, I was with him just 3 days since, and am happy to
report that both in his art and his person, he continues to embody
super-attractive homespun ostrananie.

Susan Dunn's posting (with its pzzaz-filled title! congrats) has much to
chew on, but I'm amazed she finds the tenor of this List anti-LANGPO. It
has always struck me as most pro-LANGPO, with the exceptions _really_
noticeable for their rarity-value. I speak as a highly pro-LANGPO person,
whose riff a few weeks back abt Langpo having quit the planet to pace the
heavens o'erhead meant only that it's time for beginning poets to claim
some further i.d., because to use langpo devices or stance today cannot
mean anything like what it meant in 1972. Further to this, I didnt expect
Bernstein or Andrews or Watten or Silliman to renounce anything, au
contraire, I anticipate that each will continue to _develop_ from initial
premisses.  I just dont think that in 1938 it would have made much sense to
call either HD or EP "Imagist". But this was not to be "anti-LANGPO" & if I
am the party responsible, Susan, for your impression, I hope this note
clears matters up. --I wonder what my fellow listlings think about her
impression? Buffalo Poetics List, Jan 1998 : pro-LANGPO, or anti-?

Feeling out of the loop of where it's at in American
(non-visual) poetry, so just set mail again after looking into the
archives and seeing all the interesting and somewhat hot threads. So
I wanted to add my two cents of comments and questions:

William: Why is Ed Foster evil?

Jordan: OK, so you don't like to be told you're not interesting, but
do you really think Don Byrd is a dupe? Add
_The Poetics of the Common Knowledge_ to your vocabulary and don't
delete.

Ron: At the risk of making too much out of the letter "A" (that's a
little joke referring back to an old thread I remember), I thought I
would point out (since the error was repeated in two posts subsequent
to yours) that it is "Guantanamera" and not Guantanamero". I think
you might have been thinking about Guantanamo, where, believe it or
not, a Ron Silliman-admiring-brother-of-a-friend-of-mine is
stationed. He is a naval mechanic of some sort, so the New Sentence
and Tjanting (I know this for a fact) is present on occupied Cuban
soil!

Mark: I know what you mean about Barrett Watten seeming "icy"
and "cold". I was with him in what was then Leningrad, and he was,
from a personal perspective, the epitome of that. (Ron, Lyn, and
Michael were very nice, but Barrett was very not, at least toward
me). Why do I point this out? Partly because I've long wanted to
have the occasion for saying that it has always struck me as really
strange that the detailed, journal-like chattiness of _Leningrad_
(authored by Barrett, Ron, Lyn, and Michael) makes not a single
mention that there were three other Americanski's there at the
conference with them, who rode on the tour bus with them, ate lunch
with them, walked around Leningrad with them, talked to them, changed
dollars for rubles on the black market with them, drank with the same
KGB agent with them, and so on. I mean talk about getting
air-brushed out of the picture! Couldn't they have just said Kent,
Ellen, and Steve just once?

The above, of course, is one of the weirdest, most petty notes ever
posted to list, but it does add a small piece of trivia to the
ever expanding canonization of Language poetry, doesn't it? Remember,
historians, the authors of _Leningrad_  just couldn't share the glory
of being in the dying Soviet Union with any other gringos!

But on Barrett, I won't leave it at that: I saw him again a few years
back at Orono, and he actually came up to me and said hello, how are
you. I asked him where the registration table was and he even smiled
and said, it's over there, through those doors. He was very nice, and
later, in the evening of that day, he read (along with Allen
Ginsberg, Charles Bernstein, David Bromige, and Joan Retallack),
and I remember he seemed jsut a bit self-conscious and vulnerable
before he began, though maybe that was just my impression. I thought
it was the best reading (Ginsberg gave more of a talk) because
Charles talked too fast, Joan was too imperious, and David obviously
thought he was smarter and more clever than everyone present, and I
remember that his attitude really bothered me. Barrett read a couple
of long poems that were different than anything I had ever heard.
They were prose pieces, one about female foxes underneath his house,
and the other about him and Diane Ward at a difficult time and about
something bad that happened to him. Those poems were different
because they were both distant and cold _and_ deeply, almost
embarrassingly, personal. Go figure.

That's the report on the reading in Orono in 1992. But seriously, I
keep reading those poems and I think they are brilliant. Watten is,
even though he conspired to air-brush me out of the picture, a great
poet, no question. I hope I see him again sometime and can ask him
why he was such an asshole in Leningrad.

Miekal: You make some interesting and thought-provoking points, but
isn't it better for "visual poetry" to remain something akin to that
isolated mountain village you mention in the country of Georgia?
Isn't that part of the spirit of the movement and of the value of the
work? Stay there, then, a hundred miles from the nearest university.

This post is in reply to Bob Grumman and the George Bowering.

First, Bob:

"expressive-of-the-visual"

Express? O, are we making strong coffee?

I for one don't want to express the visual. Grind it up, pound it in, steam
it, drink it, scrape the grounds out and throw them away, wondering about
banned agricultural chemicals, nerves shaking, smells so good. I'd rather
set up little cell phone transmitting stations for it. Pass it on.

I don't think the words are quite right.

Second, George:

I just got a bit of colourful mail, with Dylan's mug on the blue envelope:
get 11 CDs free, no cards to return, no automatic shipments!!!!! Looks like
I'll have to move a couple little stickers from the envelope to the reply
card and buy another 4 selections for regular prices (from $15.98), though.

Just imagine, the tables turned: George Bowering on the envelope in blue
ink, looking pretty good, no automatic shipments, 11 free books of poetry,
and just buy another 4 selections as explained in the material that came in
the envelope with this brochure.

Teenage kids spending their McMoney on it, not even looking at the Dylan
CDs in the back section of the local chain music store, stocking, as it
does, reprints of Percy Faith and his musical heirs and heiresses.

Thing is, would Dylan buy his 4 selections for regular prices in the next 2
years?

Cheers, all!

Hi, Wm B

When I say that "for me a mathematical poem is a poem that DOES math,
not one that merely discusses something mathematical,: I mean what
I'm saying pretty literally.  For instance, in my own practice, I often
subject words (verbalized images, really) to long division, which
entails division/multiplication and addition/subtraction.  A silly
off-the-cuff example would be to divide robins into spring, and get an
"answer" (or quotient) of rain.  If rain times robins doesn't exactly
equal spring, you'll get a remainder.  Actually, this is close to one
or two of my mathematical poems--mathemaku, I call them.  I'm pretty
Cummingsesque.  In another mathemaku I use a negative one as an exponent
for the sun, I think, and the reader must imagine the reciprocal of the
sun--do the math required by the exponent.  In short, the poem IS math,
not about math.
It is, as you have it, "performing/enacting the thing, rather than
talking about it"--and I agree with you that there's nothing wrong with
talking about--I've read sever poems about math that I liked a lot.

In my characterization of the math-poem process, I guess you do "run
into the abstract immediately"--except that I viscerally feel the
operation being carried out.  What I'm trying for is a mixture of
the abstract and concrete, the images acting as mathematical values
being the concrete, the math operation they're subjected, the abstract.
I hope for a tension between the two, among other things.

I hope I've answered your question.  In any event, thanks for giving me
an excuse to rattle on about my math poems--which, by the way, are
mostly not visual poems.  (There's one on the home page of my poetry
website, Comprepoetica, with a link to an explanation of it.)

I don't know what happened but as I was typing my computer transmitted
what I was typing.  Apologies.  I have a cat on my monitor.  I'm sure
she did something.  Anyway, here's a second, no, THIRD try to, Susan E.
Dunn, as I mailed my second try to myself:


1. I'm glad Charles Bernstein's reading was successful.  Hurrah for
poetry readings!

2.  I don't think my disappointment, which was not an attack, at the
choice of poet for the reading, or--later--Marjorie Perloff's syllabus,

blocked from even the smallest academic recognition.

3.  Yes, in the letter in which I started this little ruckus, I was more
or less asking "How come MP isn't doing enough for ME?"  Except that I
was truly more interested in how come MP wasn't doing ANYTHING for MY
main community of poets.  I still am.

4.  Some people on this list don't like language poetry, though exactly
what it is, is not too clear.  I didn't use the term in any negative
way.  My basic attitude is Hurrah for poetry of any kind--just please
don't wholly ignore my particular kinds.  I don't find Perloff doing
much more for visual poetry than Vendler has done for language poetry,
and it's sad.

5.  I'm not a Dylan fan, or much interested in pop music, so have
nothing to say about the last part of Dunn's letter.

Id love to hear more of what expectations you had for hypertext in the
70s that remain unfulfilled, & what people were getting you excited
about the promise of the ideal hypertext environment.  My beard, being
not quite so gray, picked up on Ted Nelson & his book Computer Lib/Dream
Machines in the later 70s, almost ten years before I even touched a
computer & could understand firsthand all the implications of
dimensionally networked information.

Kent, I met Barrett for the first time at the subsequent Orono conference
(1996) and had a very different experience.  We tended to get drunk (at
least I was drunk) and argue about the Rosenbergs with Marjorie Perloff.
I found everybody concerned pretty affable.

Well, yeah, i had a similar response to hillman--found it more engaging
than graham and her "hubby" hass (still remembering fondly that excellant
critique of hass by joe wenderoth in an apr last year---oh no, hey does
anybody know the email address for the CAP-L list? where some of these
names might mean more; i won't send you a free copy of LIGHT AS A FETTER
but maybe a discounted one)--so where was i? Oh yeah Hillman's book has
these great moments DESPITE its terrible title....

So, I also wanna plug a book that came out last year not by me.....
   SCENE OF THE CRIME by Jane Ransom.
   Her work might be of interest to many on the list, though she
   has not circulated highly in such circles. I became aware of it
   courtesy of GENERATOR magazine Dissembling issue several years
   back and  it's knock out wild feminist punny theory ridden (but
   worn so lightly) dense but oral somehow and daringly " sloppy" enough
   to get a rise out of those who love to be hit on the head with
   a bad joke that rebukes one's smugness---and it's very fast
   .One of my many new year's resolutions is to write a review of it,
   but maybe this will have more of an effect. Ransom also published
   a very weird novel this year called BYE BYE. Chris

As a non member of the academy or poetry I have been somewhat bemused
by the recent flurry here.  I could see the same scenario taking place
30 years ago with different actors, which led to this fit of nostalgia:

     Was it 30 years ago?  Resisting in my mind as melancholy remodels
my mind as green splendors the turf'n'surf, I still feel the obviously cheaper
paper of the black and lonely book made in maybe Great Brittan never
checked out maybe never to be.  Ordered by mistake, a rebellious librarian
in a rural and minor branch (2 small city blocks then now with an
international rep) of a Big Ten, or as part of a job lot.  Not part of anyone's
curriculum.  We were lucky to be allowed some Emily, some fresh air.
CONCRETE (Heavy!) then was it Borys or some other foreign name the names The
names were all foreign then to us.  Joe McCarthy's spirit was still alive in
this land.  War (or notWar) to come and what was to come was still to
come.

     Shelved next to heavy and obviously complete and authoritative
_Classics of World Literature_, two books on that shelf.  What is this
stuff? it will blow my teacher's mind we talked that way then. Not lined
up - like a drawing almost.  This is different this is new.

One suggestion on the Perloff class controversy: maybe
someone from the Visual Poetics community could organize
readings/lectures/performances/shows to compliment her
course and to compensate for perceived weaknesses/biases in
her syllabus.  This would take a good bit of energy on
someone's part, but judging by the discussions we're having
there's no lack of energy on the Visual Poetics scene.

I'm sure Dr. Perloff would encourage her students to attend.

Just a thought.

When I was a youngster, those people were still strange too.  But none

POETICS --

A young writer I know is interested in the uses of collage and found
language in American poetry. My line with him has been that these are
cinematic uses, and that the impulse to edit the landscape is not
restricted to language art. He says maybe people just don't know that it's
fun to make things up. What do you think? Rob Fitterman's got a poem that
remixes a gift basket catalogue; every time I hear it I get edgy at the
salesspeak until Rob comes to his refrain: "Net Wt 4 lbs" -- I hear a
mental rhyme with "Raid Kills Bugs Dead", but that's not the only reason
it cheers me. What do you think the other reason is?

Bern Porter who I contend, is one of the most overlooked experimental
presences in 20th century lit & the originator of found poetry feels
that Abraham Lincoln Gillespie has never gotten a fair read, & most
often Gillespie has been discounted as a Joyce imitator.  In this
writing he both demonstates how & proposes that typographical space be

Josh Schuster's post on the new dylan album confirmed my own sense
that it'd be hard to zero in on for anyone not Dylan's age.
"Adult contemporary" indeed. It's *not* about the future
it's about the past and about waste. How interesting
can that be for someone for whom it's an idea only?

Subject:      dylan vs. poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Tho I respect Don Byrd a lot, Dylan vs. "other serious artists" (i.e.
poets) doesn't seem to me to be on any target.

Dylan is not a poet. His lyrics, great in their musical contexts, do not
support being read either on a page or aloud w/o music. "Sarah," a song I
love and whose lyrics, as I said in a previous post, I typed onto my
screen, makes no sense at all as a poem. That's ok, it's not meant that way.

Dylan is a song-writer, a musician. Obviously, there are literary
influences active but they are adjectival or, better, tonal with respect to
the song.

This is an immense and interesting subject -- words/music -- though not as
easy to address, perhaps, as the parallel one of "visual poetry."

Too big for me to undertake with a lunch meeting in 90 minutes. But, I'd
just point out what happens, for example, to a poem when it's set to music.
It is substantially reduced in its language-effect. It immediately becomes
something quite different from itself. It can be a great work (recommend
song-cycles and settings by Berlioz, Mahler, Milhaud, Poulenc, Lutoslawski,
etc.), but you're not getting direct access to any part/place of/in the
poem any longer.

"But poetry once *was* a musical art. The Psalms? Sappho?" Oral shape, oral
memory are different media from those of writing. Once you could write down
thoughts, everything changed. Poetry changed.

But, that's obvious -- or at least known. There's a lot more to investigate
that I haven't got time even to adumbrate here.

David K: Just to be clear, I don't think anymore that Barrett is a
bad guy. He just struck me that way in Leningrad, but now I think he
is probably a _good_ guy! And I also think he's an _important_ poet,
even if I can't understand him most of the time. It would have
been nice to get drunk with you and Barrett and Marjorie sometime,
but now I don't drink anymore, so there's no longer any reason to go
to conferences! But I doubt if any of this matters, beyond Ron's
interesting confusion of Guantanamera and Guantanamo, which more or
less proves the whole argument from Sauserre to Derrida!

David B:  Well, I was just kidding, sort of. Sort of, because,
actually, I honestly do think you are smarter and
cleverer than I. This pisses me off, so I was just blowing off a

and your memory will deteriorate beyond the already sad condition of
my own! I certainly hope so! Please do write that book on e-mail with
my name in it before this happens!

Since the Bob dylan thread has not broken yet, and we seem to be
debating across some generational divide the value of dylan's work, i
feel compelled to move into the liststream because this past fall i became
excited about some dylan-related things, and these things might put his
work in a context that is new to some people. It began with a chance
discovery of Greil Marcus's book Invisible Republic, published by Henry
Holt. Although the subtitle of the book would suggest it is about a two- or
three-month period in 1967 when dylan holed up with members of The
Band in a pink house in woodstock and made "The Basement Tapes," it is
really another exploration for Marcus into his notion that there is a secret
history, or an alternate history that cannot be found in large public
events, and that is inscribed, and in some cases necessarily encrypted,
in cultural products, like songs. He worked this out somewhat
overheatedly in his book Lipstick Traces, published by Harvard UP,
which i have since looked at. Marcus, in Invisible Republic, contends that
Dylan chafed at being adopted into a anti-war anti-establishment
college-based movement. He said to one reviewer, "how do you know
i'm against the war?" Those months in Woodstock were a time when
Dylan reconnected with an American folk tradition, what Marcus calls a
"series of secret handshakes" conducted in "the old weird America."
Marcus is guessing (though he knows dylan well i believe, but dylan is
one guy not in the book's acknowlegements) that Dylan renewed himself
by sampling the songs of such fellows as Mississippi John Hurt and the
Carter Family, Clarence Ashton, Blind Lemon Jefferson and all those
people collected on the Harry Smith Antholgy of American Folk Music,
which was recently rereleased in a handsome package that includes
Smith's inimitable liner notes and a booklet that features one of the
Marcus chapters from Invisible Republic. The spirit of Marcus's argument,
and dylan corroborated this in a NYtimes interview with Jon Pareles, is
that there is a renegade tradition in American music that represents the
dispossessed  outlawry, the crazed, often inbred nature of some
regions not touched by commerce and middleclass aspirations, and that
many many Americans respond to this whether they know it or not, in his
songs, in the Stones, in the new blues.... and that dylan is more
comfortable with this kind of apolitical opposition, an American
independence born not of a pursuit of happiness or truth but escaping
the dicates of a larger cultural expectation.

I like the new dylan album very much. It's tightly put together but it's in a
gunny sack of sound. And in one song, the narrator cites his reading of
Erica Jong as evidence that he is sensitive to women, so if he is aware
of a possible generational divide, he is unbothered by it.  It is the
irreverent unrepentant dylan at top form, with the great swirling Wurlitzer
organ in many of the cuts.

I recommend to anyone to take a look at the Marcus book and read his
discussion of the "Folk-Lyric" section of the Smith anthology. This section
is full of strange songs like Coo-Coo Bird, and Marcus cites some folk
scholars who describe this song form, based in English folk song, as
being devoid of narrative strategy or plot, and instead relying upon
disorienting images and repititions and disrupting breaks in hearer's
expectations, not unlike what someone recently said on this list of
Watten.

But we don't need to go back to an idealized oral antiquity to supply
examples of poetical-musical compatibility.  What about Elizabethan
ballads, Blake, even Ginsberg?  One could argue that "poems" like "Come
Live with Me and Be My Love" or "When to Her Lute Corrina Sings" are
"substantially reduced" in their "language-effect" precisely because of
being _removed_ from their musical settings, as they are in their
Nortonized fossil-existences.  I'm not sure, however, that one wants to go
there in either case, as what happens is one ends up committed to a
principle of preservation of the originary moment of creation, with all
that baggage of intention and other bugbears.

My main point, I suppose, is that "direct access" is a problem no matter
what; if being set to music closes off certain (imagined?) points of entry
into a poem, so does a shift from manuscript to type, or from one printed
format to another, or from being read silently to being read aloud, or from
being read on Tuesday to being read on Friday.  Conversely, a musical
context might open up latent areas of signification unavailable on purely
textual reading.  A friend of mine picked up his guitar one day and belted
out an impromptu country-western rendition of "Do Not Go Gentle into that
Good Night"--the printed version has seemed flat to me ever since.  And of
course, there's the old observation that you can sing the beginning to
_Paradise Lost_ to the tune of the _Flintstones_ theme.  This kind of
backwards historical contamination operates, albeit in less violent
degrees, on much of what we read, hear, etc.

imagine what revisions, thitherto undreaded, might emerge from an
'80s-style West-coast hardcore version of "The Love Song of J. Alfred
Prufrock," or a polka treatment of Bob Perelman's "Chronic Meanings."

Um, Bob Dylan: he's that old guy, right?

I had accounted for kent's "let-em-have-it-on-all-sides" note by supposing
he'd been at the sourmash, so it was disconcerting to learn he's on the
wagon.I had also thought--since he'd put ginsberg _in_ the picture, & left
perelman _out_ of it--that the poet at that group reading at Orono in 93
whom he recalls as acting smarter than everyone else, was not me but
actually bob perelman.  I thought this because I didnt want to be described
that way and figured bob would be an acceptable substitute, since he is
smarter and cleverer than me.

But kent is correct, while my memory for distant events is nigh
unimpeachable, more recent happenings tend to elude my recall. When i have
to put everything into storage for christmas, because of having to clear
space in our little home for all those big relatives, i cant remember what
went in which box, which is why i havent yet resuscitated my yasusada. This
jibes with the Don-Byrd syndrome of having one's keener memories date 'way
back. I actually have listened to all  the dylan albums, but the Surprise
Factor kept lessening after Nashville Skyline, and that I found an
unpleasant surprise, since it wasnt Highway 61 or even Blonde on Blonde.
There's a reluctance to let more stuff in, I guess, has come with age. But
my 33-y-o son gave me the new Dylan CD for xmas & one of these nights, I'll
listen. But 'nostalgia' scarcely feels the word for the keenness of earlier
astonishments, seared into the memory rather than confabulated there by
dotage. "Visons of Johanna," wow, and equally intense were For Love, Words,
Pieces, Bending the Bow and The North Atlantic Turbine. Or Persona or Il
Notte. And all those Godard film/lectures. But while like some other old
farts I have experienced what I feared was terminal diminution of esthetic
elation, Made to Seem boils my potatoes, & McCaffery's tour de force
pop-poem at New Hants, & anything by Randolph Healey, & Debbie an Epic, &
Rough Bush, & The Garcia Family Co-Mercy, & Dan Farrell's poetry and Chris
Stroffolino's, & Jeff Derksen recent effusions & those pieces I heard Aaron
Shurin read recently & on & on I mustnt go, but. . . . Jack Spicer (who
aged rapidly) once declared that it was hard to be a poet after 35, because
you had accumulated so much furniture you couldnt get in or out of the
poem-room with much alacrity; maybe thats what some of us suffer from as
time goes by. It actually makes me all the more grateful for the young
poets I do, by some chance, read or hear, and there are still too many to
mention in an e-post, though Darren-Wershler Henry and Christian Bok come
to mind from my recent trip to Toronto, and our own Alan Sondheim (young to
_me_ ), and Tony Lopez, & [message ends abruptly as its author is dragged

Since no one has responded to Joshua Schuster's description
yesterday of Ed Foster as "evil", does this mean that there is a
consensus on this list that he is? Personally, I think Talisman is a
great magazine, so I'm wondering.  Is it run by a bad person?

Also, wondering if it's been mentioned that there is a neat review of
Poetics List up at Postmodern Culture, with our list compared
(favorably) to the Academy of American Poets site. I think this is
the last "free" issue of PmC, so those who haven't might want to
check it out.

I believe it was not *Ed* Foster but *Hal* Foster, who teaches at Cornell,
who Josh described as evil, a different situatio entirely.  -m.

According to KENT JOHNSON:

I'm sorry! I now see that the evil one is _Hal_ Foster and not
_Ed_. The sauce has messed-up my vision along with my memory. By the
way, David, what "yasusada book" are you talking about?

 Fellow Listers --

        The attachment above is an article by Mark Leyner that I found
quite hilarious and also -- in a slightly perverse way -- extremely
relevant to many of the concerns of this list. I hope you can all "get"
this onto your word processor -- if you can't, please backchannel me and
we'll arrange some other way to transmit it. It's worth the several
screens it takes up!

I wanted to try and respond to David B.'s recent surprise about the list
being thought anti-Langpo. I think he's certainly right to be surprised
-- clearly the majority of folks here have, if not completely positive
feelings, clear interest in and attraction to this . . . project. As
people with whom I've exchanged back-channels with over the past year
know, however, I was never among them, for a mixture of personal and
poetic reasons.

_Mike and Dale's Younger Poets_ has just published its new issue #7,
with lots of work worth checking out, especially (for me) from Anselm
Hollo, Lisa Jarnot, Duncan McNaughton and Lewis Warsh; the last third of
this particular issue, however, is made up of posts from this list in
late September. Without referencing that specific thread, I want to
quote something that Dodie Bellamy said in the midst of it, this from
September 26:

        "I can sympathize with Tom Clark's hatred of Language Writers. I
was living in San Francisco when the Lang-Pos took over the scene--it
was brutal and many people were treated very badly."

I didn't know Dodie then (a situation I'm glad has been remedied!) but I
can definitely understand and agree with this comment. I had just moved
to San Francisco in 1980 when I first became conscious of a group of
folks called the "Language Poets" -- the name was then an occasion of
some consternation among them, but it's obviously stuck. It was at that
time that I met Barry, Bob Perelman, and Carla Harryman -- I never did
meet Ron or Lyn, but they were prominently around, as was Steve Benson
(whatever happened to Steve? Is he still around?) and some other folks
that, I think, made up the "west coast branch" of the group. This was
the personal part of the equation -- I found Barry (besides looking
uncomfortably like George Will) well, almost insufferable. Priggish.
Aloof. Supercilious. Contemptuous. On the other hand, Carla was quite
affable; Bob was certainly always willing to engage in friendly debate.
These are obviously personal reactions and carry the weight personal
reactions do. I'm glad to see that other people feel differently about
Barry's personality.

But the thing is, I found the poetics part insufferable too -- I came
into poetry in the 70s, a devotee and student of, first, Pound and
Williams, then Olson, then the Black Mountain folks (but not, as Ron had
it a few months back, the "whiny 3rd-generation Black Mountain outsider
nostalgia" school -- not an exact quote, but close) and the New York
school -- later I was extremely fortunate to meet and even study with
many of the people in the Allen Anthology and the New York school
anthology, the two books that were my bibles. I remember really being
excited about Don Byrd's book on Olson, felt it was one of the smartest
things I'd ever read. This was my education -- this was the world I had
somehow miraculously gained a small foothold in, and I was grateful.

And then I moved to San Francisco, and started publishing a short-lived
but well-read magazine called _Zephyr_, and met the above-mentioned
folks at readings, and talks, and seminars, and such, and found that
they were consciously setting themselves in opposition to the people and
ideas and work I had come out of, the universe that had formed my
poetics and still does; I mean, people have joked about Freud's theory
about the sons and the father on this list, but I have never seen -- and
never will again, I'm sure -- such a conscious Oedipal scene as this
one. They weren't nice about it, they weren't subtle about it: they just
announced we are the new thing, take it or leave it. I left it. I found
the work that came out of these half-baked French and Russian
deconstructionist linguistic theories pretentious and extremely
self-serving. Despite the undergraduate Marxism, I found it
anti-political. I found it devoid of humor or wit. Most importantly, I
found the ADDRESS of such work to be extremely narrow; I thought the
work had abandoned the hope of affecting a wide audience, the hope of
somehow EMBODYING that wider social context; I found it elitist.

Ancient history perhaps, but as Don and Ron and Tom have, I think,
pointed out recently, what we learn is what stays with us. Now it's now,
and after several years overseas and out of the loop of the poetry
world, I've tried to re-educate myself about contemporary practice, what
people are reading and writing and thinking; being part of this list has
been a big part of that. Some things have changed, some things haven't;
I find myself liking many poems that I would still call "langpo" 20
years later, and disliking others. I haven't read FRAME yet, but will
probably pick it up and give it a glance, based on what some people have
said about it on this list; on the other hand, I found Barry's lecture
in the ILS turgid and, finally, not worth the effort it took to read it.
Is it all a matter of "taste," then, and can these things even be talked
about? Well, I thought yesterday was the best day ever on the list, at
least in my time on it -- so many provocative and intelligent posts! So
I guess the answer is yes -- with the constant hope that people who are
working different streets and different corners of those streets be
granted respect and recognition and not automatically be shunted aside
to the low-rent district.

Apologies for taking up so much valuable screen-space.

Joe Safdie

I seem to be having two of them:

This Saturday, the 17th, at the Luggage Store gallery at 1007 Market
(Market and 6th in SF) at 8:00 I will be reading with Arnold Kemp and
possibly Jack Hirschman - The current show there has to do with emotional
and psychic baggage so I will be reading from my luggage-related work. (I
actually have such work as I have just finished a manuscrpt called The
Case.)

The Luggage Store is a new reading venue. Leslie Scalapino is doing a
performance there with a performance artist whose name I can't remember in
February in the store window that will also include a pile of dirt or
possibly mud. More about this later.

Also Saturday 31 January there will be a group reading for the new Avec
Sampler which will include Lissa McLaughlin, George Albon, Stephen-Paul
Martin and myself.

Spandrift went to Brainerd to escape the law.  But he won't tell you that,
he's on the run, the cagey varmint he is. Here's a tune from his most
recent CD, "Words Gone Naked"

O them green, green hills of Brainerd,
How I long for your mustache in my pie!
For your dolesome wholesome Folsom

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

The History of Modern Poetry:
From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode

 (Chapter 1)
To replace every line with a better one until the poem was perfected--such
was his simplistic thinking until Ezra Pound straightened him out, circa
1914, staring for weeks at a rotting fish until the poem was perfected.
There had to be a better way!

(Chapter 2)
Until Ezra Pound straightened him out Yeats sulked in Celtic twilight
staring for weeks at a rotting fish, surfacing only to consult the
Martians.

(Chapter 3)
There had to be a better way to describe a red wheelbarrow!

(Chapter 4)
Yeats sulked in Celtic twilight while Spicer and Duncan made world-series
predictions, surfacing only to communicate with the Martians living in
North Beach or Berkeley.

(Chapter 5)
To describe a red wheelbarrow Wallace Stevens or that other poet whose
name slipped my mind, while Spicer and Duncan made world-series
predictions,  squandering a family fortune and living in North Beach or
Berkeley...   No, that was somebody else.

(Chapter 6)
Wallace Stevens, or that other poet, whose name slipped my mind delivered
the infant Allen Ginsberg in Paterson, New Jersey, squandering a family
fortune and marrying the woman whose face was on the nickel.   No, that
was somebody else.

(Chapter 7)
In his old age he imagined that he had delivered the infant Allen Ginsberg
in Paterson, New Jersey.   It would have made a great story!  Marrying the
woman whose face was on the nickel was small consolation for a life of
obscurity.

(Chapter 8)
In his old age he imagined that he had once discussed Gertrude Stein with
Picasso.  It would have made a great story.

(Chapter 9)
To replace every line with a better one was small consolation for a life
of obscurity--such was his simplistic thinking.  Once discussed Gertrude
Stein with Picasso , circa 1914.

I'm not sure I follow your logic here: is Jong being read by young women (by
anyone) these days?  I consider her someone who seemed "liberated" half a
lifetime ago, but is a more than a little beside the point nowadays.  The
biggest belly laugh I got from the album on my first couple of hearings was
from that line.  He's got to be sarcastic, right, affirming how little he
cares or knows about feminist issues.

I believe the reason you see so much energy on this list is many of the
poets/publishers of the visual poetry world have placed as much emphasis
in creating community, networking across all boundaries, widening
access, treating all media whether its a tape recorder, a copier or a
computer as more bandwidth, more cracks for the new & unaccepted to
flourish like weeds in the urban landscape.  The movement of
international visual poetries is participatory & on many levels
unmediated by the regimes of academia.  It invites marjorie & her
students to become participants in a visual / virtual universe, show
their work in mail art shows, post works to websites, interact with the
wr-eye-tings email list, exchange & collaborate on works via mail.  &
since myself & others are half-a continent away, exchanges via internet
geared toward designing a truly interactive online hyperculture have a
decent chance to evolve toward a supportive decentralized learning for
everyone.

yes indeed, the erica jong reference is funny, and blatantly a lazy rhyme
given in the exhausted spirit of the song; that last tune, my heart's in the
highlands, 17 minutes long or so, is as shaggy a dog song as dylan has.
the music drives it, though, makes it stand up despite all the loose
carefree phrasemaking that hangs off it. but of course one shouldn't say
that bob dylan is anything with respect to feminism and the like. He's not
in these songs in a literal way. He's doing voices.

a couple (three, actually) of the other posts seemed to be making merry
with the idea that dylan or greil marcus or I have any right to point
towards an "invisible republic" of outlawry threading its way through
american folk music. but gawd, don't ever suggest that the poetic
enthusiams of this list are not engaged in some spirited opposition to the
narrow forces of a dominant culture. thar's the heroism, "emodying a
wider social context" indeed!

Hi, Danny:

I hate to sound condescending but while I'm sure your suggestion that
"the Visual Poetics community . . . organize readings/lectures/
performances/shows to complement (Marjorie Perloff's) course and to
compensate for perceived weaknesses/biases in her syllabus" is
well-intentioned, it's a little naive.  First off, Dr. Perloff's show is
already running.  Second, the community I've been talking about (I'd
call it the community of unrecognized visual poets rather than THE
visual POETICS community, which shows you how nit-picking I can be), is
scattered and unwealthy.  It'd be very hard, whatever the energy
available, to throw together ANY reasonably representative vispo
reading ANYwhere in the country.  The only recent one of any magnitude
was the one in Edmonton, which had money troubles though backed by a
university department.  Even putting together a representative anthology
of vispo has proved so far too much for us.  The real problem seems to
be that we're a community of artists, not a community of academics.  Our
minds aren't geared to career-lane functioning.

Finally, inasmuch as Dr. Perloff has left all material published by the
people in our group off even her list of recommended publications, I
rather doubt that she'd encourage attendance at any reading series we
could put together.  I suppose she'd have to mention it, as she has
been said to have mentioned some of the websites our group has work at,
though not the main one, Light & Dust, but more than that . . . well,
I'm still awaiting evidence of any real openness on her part to our
group.

Harold, you lost me on this one.  I was using "expressive-of-the-visual"
(admittedly awkward) to describe textual poems that vividly bring to
life some visual image or scene.  The point was to distinguish them from
visual poems.  Such poems are not visual but ABOUT the visual.  I don't
see what whether you want to express the visual or not has anything to
do with it.  I also continue to feel bewildered about the hostility the
word "express" occasions.  I guess a lot of people (me, for one) don't
think much of poetry-as-self-expression, but that's SELF-expression, not
expression.  All poetry has words (at least in my taxonomy), and all
words express.  Ergo, all poetry is expressive.

My Mistake, and thanks for the biographical clarification. I have
relatives from towns near Brainerd (Crosby and Ironton), but unlike the
guys in the movie _ Fargo_, I don't know where to go to get laid (though I
imagine I could find a woodchipper without much difficulty).

            Tom, I see nothing in your note that I do not agree with.  My only
question was, how come every one seems to have an opinion on this songwriter
when  there seems to be almost no comparable discussion of poets. I insisted
that Dylan was a "serious artist" (i.e. a serious song writer whom I wanted to
compared with serious poets) precisely because I didn't want to make the
category mistake you  want to correct.

            Although it appears that 5 or 6 people have read _Frame_, this is
not enough common ground to support a serious discussion of current poetic
practice.  Pound says somewhere, "It doesn't make any difference what books
people read as long as they read the same books."   Of course, some may want to
take his comment as a fascist apology for the canon, but in  practical terms, if
this list (or any list) is to support a useful discussion it must have shared a
vocabulary.

    David, the other side of this (or two other sides) is the fact that until
about the time I graduated from college I listened almost exclusively to be-bop
and blues.  I had some Litte Richard and some do-wop records, for parties, but
I listened Parker, Monk and Davis, or B.B. King, Howling Wolf, and Muddy
Waters, who all started recording about the time I was born, and to Ellington,
who started recording twenty years before that.  It was _Hiway 61 Revisited_
and _Sgt. Pepper_ (along with the various distortions--both ideological and
otherwise--of that time) that made me part of my generation.

    My daughter, who will graduate from college this spring, listens to _Hiway
61 Revisited_ almost every day, I think, but, when I ask her what she thinks is
going on musically, she gives me David S. Ware, post-Coltrane music of the
spheres (so Ware insists)--wonderful, but  I don't need her to tell me this is
good.

    But, of course, "Visions of Johanna" belongs to the art of the song in the
grandest scale.  One speaks of it, in the company of songs of the great
Renaissance song writers.

    I keep bugging my students about what to listen to.  The best thing they
have turned me onto recently is Tricky, _Pre-Millennium Tension_.

    What else? What else?

morning never got beyond my server who had some kind of trouble he

Just got the tape; I especially liked the line before by a woman who says
to the Dylan-narrator, "You don't read women writers, do you?"  The
response of "I do, I read Erica Jong" (or whatevahs) is surely ironic.
What gets me about the album, in the context of all the discussion on this
list, is how scenic-mode-official-lyric-culture-univocal it is.  Does the
music, mainly blues inflected, really draw us to such an extent to
something many on this list (if not the langpo bashers, whoever they are)
heartily disapprove of?  It's all about love and loss, love and loss--and
Tom, those themes _are_ ones that young people tap into, no?  Or was I
just warped?  Ok, I was, no matter.  Lots of sentiment and cliches.
Does "sentiment" now belong in songs, but not in poems?
But I, for one, have enjoyed my first couple of listens to it in my car
driving through the Koolau tunnels to work (the album is tropical only in
the linguistic sense...).

Study: Children of Divorce Twice as Likely to Write Bad Poetry

http://www.theonion.com/onion3301/divorcepoetry.html

Excerpts:

"DURHAM, NC--A study released Monday by Duke University's Center for the
American Family confirmed what many child-development experts have
asserted for years: Children whose parents are divorced are twice as
likely to compose bad poetry as those whose parents are married....

"The Duke researchers also found a strong correlation between the nature
of a particular divorce and quality of poetry. In 90 percent of divorces
categorized as "amicable," the breakup results in rhyming poems, usually
with irritating, "sing-songish" A-B-A-B rhyme schemes. The more
acrimonious the split, however, the greater the odds of a child turning
to other, more wretch-inducing poetic forms: Eighty-five percent of
contested divorces end in free verse, the study found, and three in four
divorces involving custody battles end in haiku...."

person giving a reading at a coffee shop has an effect.

As I see it, you're definitely being sylladissed (new word for
you)... but Marjorie Perloff's not the Visual Poetics Antichrist.
She'd mention any readings/shows you put together & some
curious someone would come, just as I've been checking out the
web sites and printing out the book references mentioned in this
thread.  Print them out and distribute them at your reading... your
conference will happen in individual heads.

But I *was* wrong about one thing:  this doesn't have to take
much energy.

Let me know if you hold a reading & I'll donate some money for
coffee.

"Daleko, daleko..." - DDT
---------------------------
Hi, Danny:

I hate to sound condescending but while I'm sure your
suggestion that
"the Visual Poetics community . . . organize readings/lectures/
performances/shows to complement (Marjorie Perloff's) course
and to
compensate for perceived weaknesses/biases in her syllabus"
is
well-intentioned, it's a little naive.  First off, Dr. Perloff's show is
already running.  Second, the community I've been talking about
(I'd
call it the community of unrecognized visual poets rather than
THE
visual POETICS community, which shows you how nit-picking I
can be), is
scattered and unwealthy.  It'd be very hard, whatever the energy
available, to throw together ANY reasonably representative vispo
reading ANYwhere in the country.  The only recent one of any
magnitude
was the one in Edmonton, which had money troubles though
backed by a
university department.  Even putting together a representative
anthology
of vispo has proved so far too much for us.  The real problem
seems to
be that we're a community of artists, not a community of
academics.  Our
minds aren't geared to career-lane functioning.

Finally, inasmuch as Dr. Perloff has left all material published by
the
people in our group off even her list of recommended
publications, I
rather doubt that she'd encourage attendance at any reading
series we
could put together.  I suppose she'd have to mention it, as she
has
been said to have mentioned some of the websites our group
has work at,
though not the main one, Light & Dust, but more than that . . .
well,
I'm still awaiting evidence of any real openness on her part to our
group.

I think if you correlate Jonathan Mayhew's mini-history of 20th century poetry
with the general Dylan-poetry debate, you can just about sense a faint breeze
wafting from the approaching future century-millennium-era.  Because what
seems Great & Essential to us is suddenly framed in an entirely new museum
of events; maybe a repetition of what happened at the beginning
of the 20th century, nevertheless a reconfiguration on behalf of the
GNU gnu.

I too was puzzled by Ms Dunn's notion that this list was anti-LangPo. I
have always thought that it was made up of people who are either Language
Poets pr assume that the Language Poets are the main thing or one of the
main things. Maybe she got crossed between this list and the one we hear
about from time to time, the one about the strangely named new Formalists.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I appreciate Joe Safdie's frankness. But sometimes it's more like a
steamroller than a scalpel. The traits he attributes in one part to the
langpos of sf en masse, turn out to be just those that he feels Barrett
Watten possesses. Later in his post, he declares that langpoets (again en
masse) were/are "devoid of humor and wit." Perelman?  Benson?  Harryman?
Robinson? Four of the wittiest, funniest people I ever met! Ron Silliman
once worked as a standup comedian! And perhaps perilangpoetic, but
certainly very much in the middle of things then, the devastating wit of
Tom Mandel, the deadpan humor of Michael Palmer!

 Joe's take is unhappily similar to Tom Clark's would-be assassinations in
_Poetty Flash_ mid-80s. Barrett is made the butt, and on the other hand,
_all_ langpos are tarred with the Barrett brush.

Moving in and taking over--what do you think it was like when Black
Mountain came to _your_ town?!  When the Beats rolled into cities in the
middle of the night, their tanks on rubber tracks, their submachine guns
loaded with live ammo? There's been worse than Langpo, Joe! Ever read
Robert Duncan's sadistic dissection of Robin Blaser's versions of _Les
Chimeres_ ? Look it up--in a journal called _Audit_ issued in Buffalo in
66-67 or 67-68 : page upon redundant page of vitriolic grandstanding. Our
dear friend Robert Duncan (I say that not only with irony). It drove Robin
out of the country.

 Ever read Ed Dorn & Tom Clark's _Rolling Stock_ , that wanted to wipe out
any number of xenotypes, including gays with aids?   I personally do not
remember any occasion of Dodie Bellamy being tortured, nor would I have
stood idly by had I been witness. I did hear complaints, from others, that
they felt left out. It didn't appear to be, initially, a matter of personal
animosity, but rather of ideological difference. So then why would you want
to be acknowledged by a group that you thought should not exist?

Tom Clark was one mean opponent whose chief exception to langpo (since he
couldnt handle theory) was that they operated as a group, This was to
overlook Tom Clark and his cronies in the late 60's with their "All Stars
anthology" and attitude. Well, that and his objection to Watten as
humorless. Let me assure those of you who have not felt the barb of BW's
wit, that he is far from that.

What I say above concerning groups does not, in my opinion, apply to any
entity that takes upon itself the responsibility for the entire poetic
community, such as the newspaper Poetry Flash. Tom became a willing hitman
for Poetry Flash. Read the xenofiles for '85.  PF still has a virtual
embargo on Langpoets, which soon will have been in place as long as the
USA's, on Cuba. A couple of token comrades have been admitted. I myself
became involved in a cyclone in '89 after PF published my report on the
Objectivist Conference at Royaumont : a number of contribs--and a PF
editor--tried to trash it and the Conference, because in their judgment,
Langpoets had no right to confer about Objectivists. Certainly not if it
involved flying them to France, rather than (I guess) card-carrying
Objecitvist scholars and poets. I dont know where Joe was when "out of the
country," but unless it was Bosnia, he probably had a quieter time than we
did in SF. That cyclone whirled for 6 months.

Steve Benson, btw, is married, recently a father, living (quietly?) on the
coast of northern Maine (hope they are ok thru this wretched weather). B-c
me anyone who would like Steve's address. One of the two or three finest
poets of performance in the anglophone world, and sorely missed by his
friends and fans out here.

Since the Dylan discussion continues...

My Russian rock geroi, Boris Grebinshikov, just released an
album ("Lilit") recorded with members of The Band.  Excellent
album, but I presume it's not sold in the USA since it inexplicably
bears a sticker announcing (po Angliskii) "Not Sold in the USA."
Another bizarre manifestation of kiosk marketing theory.

If it is available, I recommend it.  Avoid his English-language
recordings, though; the lyrics are as bland as his Russian lyrics
are intricate & rhythmic.

I haven't read the Marcus, although he's ventured these ideas in his
Artforum column so they're not entirely new to me.  But recently I saw Don't
Look Back, the early study of Dylan and Baez on tour by DA Pennebaker,
again.  At the beginning of the film Dylan lands on UK shores and holds a
glutted press conference in which he tries to answer questions, well,
helpfully.  He's game even for the most confrontive and/or stupid.  During
the course of the film, mostly in back-seat shots in which Baez eats fruit
and looks out the window, Dylan reviews the press coverage of his tour with
growing incredulity/amusement; these scenes are interspersed with more
media-interaction scenes in which Dylan bridles and begins to hone an
evasiveness that aids him in side-stepping any pigeon-holing.  To me, it
seemed like a natural and inevitable response to external pressure to impose
perimeters to his (aesthetic) field (as well as to participate in the
culture-promo industry -- he points out to a Time reporter pleading with him
for an interview that he has filled Royal Hall without Time coverage).
It's a response he has perfected since -- this is the great
I'm-not-here-to-meet-your-expectations-&-I-don't-give-a-fuck quality on this
new platter (as well as there in Maggie's Farm & earlier).  I get a sense
that for him it's a global, automatic mechanism, and so the Marcus thesis
seems both self-evident to this listener and partial.

I'll see him with Van Morrison at the Garden Tuesday.

On the music/writing arena, does anyone else know the Canadian/UK book The
Penguin that John Lennon wrote maybe c. 1970?

they should have, and there are no "shoulds" and I don't want Christine's

*music*...In some sense the words (tho' very important indeed) have a
function in relation to the musical/performative character of a song.
(Which is why the well-intentioned populism of high-school and college
teachers post-1965 was/is so off-base:  you know, those folks who always
thought they were getting students "interested in poetry" by analyzing
Blowin in the Wind or Elinor Rigby *on the page* with minimal or no
reference to the music). I'd argue that most of us aren't *asking the same
questions* (about sentiment or mainstream conventionality) of Dylan songs,
that we ask of a Richard Wilbur poem.  (and anyway Wilbur's harp-playing
isn't as good)

Danny:

I now deem this little controversy over the Perloff Seminar an
unqualified success!  Why?  It has now produced your infra-verbally
delightful word "sylladiss!"  Much thanks!

And I agree that "It doesn't take a full-scale conference to make a
counterstatement... unless your mind is 'geared to career-lane
functioning.'"  It's just that me and my pals (and a lot of other people
in the field that I don't know) have been making one-poet and two-poet
counterstatements for many years with almost no effect on the big world,
so it's hard not too be a little impatient, and perhaps get over-irked
when someone with some clout like Marjorie Perloff seems so overtly
to overlook us.

I'm wholly confident that our counterstatements WILL take effect
eventually, though--and maybe this mini-brouhaha will ignite some more
visible counterstatement.  Meanwhile, I've got to get my sputtering for
the year out (my year being up on Groundhog/Joyce Day, my birthday).

Apologies for (but not retraction of) the condescension, and I'll hold
you to your promise of coffee money!

Bromige's posting on langcomedians is first rate.  Forgot to list the
slapstick grouping (led by Chuck "Little Tramp" Bernstein).

Really, and seriously, that was a great post.  You hit the head on the
nail especially when you noted that Clark hates the langsters *because
they are a group*....This is a very U.S. response.  And in my opinion this
resentment of people for their collective work is almost always present in
lang-bashing.  What's so preposterous about it, obviously, is that the
langsters have always been, even at their most group-identish, an
exceptionally loose and tolerant and vague kind of collective!  But no one
ever got poor overestimating the virulence of U.S. ultra-individualism.

Wasn't "Come Live with Me and Be My Love" also performed in the film Valley
of the Dolls by the lounge singer character who married one of the leads--
she who later found out he was pretty badly developmentally disabled?  Am I
thinking of the same song?

Let those who are in favor with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such titles bars,
Unlook't for joy in that I honour most.
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
And in themselves their pride lies buried,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
The painful warrior famoused for fight,
After a thousand victories once foil'd,
Is from the book of honour razed quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
   Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,
   Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.

I consider this list clearly a langpo center; thus langpo gets discussed
a lot; thus anti-langpo comments (and negative comments about langpo
eminences like Marjorie Perloff) HAVE to come up.  And it's easy for a
super-sensitive partisan like Dr. Dunn to decide from a few negative
comments that "'language poet' seems to be a pejorative term on this
list."

Thinking about it, I can't remember "visual poet" ever drawing a
negative comment."  Visual poetry is not discussed enough, or visible
enough to draw fire, I suspect.

Getting too far behind, but Mark P's comments on Mark W's poetry does hit
home, & I'm ashamed to have forgotten Mark W's book(s) when I listed some
of the really good stuff Ive read lately. But memoru doesnt always serve.

I take the point that it would be good to say something about those books,
but I dont have much time this ay em to do so. On the other hand, getting
the digest, I see that this 'turn' of the conversation has definitely
expanded the whole thing, so it seems 'we' can & do get going over poetry
once the glove is thrown...

This discussion reminds me of one of the funniest encounters between pop
and poetry I've ever heard. Some years ago NPR interviewed James Merrill,
and -- god knows why -- Susan Stamberg decided to get Merrill's opinion on
the poetic quality of rock music by reciting some lines from a Eurythmics
song ("Sweet dreams are made of these./Who am I to disagree./I traveled the
world and the seven seas./Everybody's lookin' for something.")  He was
reluctant to take the bait, and said something about needing the music to
go along with the words before he could make an assessment. Stamberg
all-too-quickly obliged by humming (and humming badly) the melody to the
song, to which Merrill replied, "Hardly Mozart."

Thanks, Mark. But I didn't forget Chas, I left him out because I understood
Joe Safdie to be addressing his problem with the west coast Langpoets.

Would also remark that a number of Langpos didnt suffer fools gladly--so I
can't agree to the "vague" in yr characterization, and even the "loose"
hardly fits my recollection of public correction during post-talk
discussions. But humor there always was. Humor is serious business, and
vice versa. Language is inevitably funny, if you look long enough.

Hugh Steinberg told me the other night about a T-shirt he'd had made up,
with pictures of Groucho, Chico and Harpo--and "Carlo". It would have been
fun if everyone had turned up one evening at the Perelman/Shaw loft talks,
or at an 80 Langton St event, wearing the same. "False Portrait" of the
Language School.

              <mprejsn@LAW.EMORY.EDU>

On groups in poetry:

Is it necessary to line up for or against groups & their activities in poetry
or other arts?  Groups have their positive & their negative aspects, with
regard to both production and reception.  In fact, since we are (by Dante's
definition) "the companionable animal", groups are unavoidable, essential.

However, all that doesn't keep me from believing that the most intense &
compelling realities of making poetry (on the one hand), and reading/hearing/
understanding it (on the other), happen to individuals, often quite solitary
individuals.  A corollary of this is that the poet's pantheon of heroes and
influences, unlike the conscientious critic or scholar's - the poet's sense
of literary history - will be absolutely personal, based on all sorts of
private, conscious & subconscious, literary & extra-literary, LOVES & HATES.
The poet doesn't care if there is no arguable relation between, say,
Hart Crane and Osip Mandelstam; he or she will MAKE the relation if
necessary. All this is of very little interest to literary politicians
always targeting what's "useful" or "new" or "correct" or whatever.
And though criticism & poetry support one another to some extent, there
will always be that little gap, that difference, too.  - Henry Gould

p.s. I would also hold that the individuality involved in making poetry
inheres, to some extent, in the artwork itself; so that there's always
more THERE than will fit into any group trends or classification systems.

p.p.s. Montale once criticized Italian intellectuals, always eager to
articulate & take sides in political debates, who also claimed to be
artists.  He said something like: "I don't deny the genuine seriousness
of their social commitment; I simply deny that they are free men."
I know how recherche & unfashionable all this sounds... hey, what IS
a free man?  Or woman?

funny, my take was that there were language poets present, poets that
deny being language poets as others will label, people that just aren't
language poets, people that are anti-language poetry, and those that
choose to stay out of it.

in other words, there just ain't one pov 'round here.

The piece on bad baby poets is from The Onion, a satirical newspaper in
Madison, WI, which was founded by Tim Keck (and others), who now publishes
The Stranger, a weekly in Seattle, where I'm now typing this note.

clothesline saga


after a while we took in the clothes
nobody said very much
just some old wild shirts & a couple pairs of pants
nobody really wanted to touch

mama come in and picked up a book
and papa asked her what it was
somebody else said, "what do you care"
and papa said "just because"

then he started to take back the clothes
and hang them on the line
it was january 30th
and everybody was feeling fine

the next day everybody got up
to see if the clothes were dry
the dogs were barking, a neighbor passed
mama of course she said "Hi"

"have you heard the news?" he said with a grin
"the vice-president's gone mad"
"where?" "downtown" "when?" "last night"
"hmm, well that's too bad"

"well there ain't nothing we can do about it" said the neighbor
"it's just something we're going to have to forget"
"yes, i guess so" said ma, then she asked me
if the clothes were still wet

i reached up and touched my shirt
the neighbor said "are those clothes yours?"
i said "some of them, not all of them"
then he said "you always help out around here with the chores?"

i said "some of the time, not all of the time"
then the neighbor, he blew his nose
just then papa yelled out
"mama wants you back in the house with those clothes"

i just do what i'm told to of course
so i went back into the house
mamma met me and took all the clothes
and then i shut all the doors


--This ballad, from The Basement Tapes, struck me from the word Go as
wonderful folk-poetry (As well as more priceless bob dylan camping of a
form); if Sir Patrick Spens and Twa Corbies etc etc which we were presented
with in college english, sans music, cd be poetry, then surely "clothesline
saga" will live for ever. David

Does this also mean that
Children of Divorce are more likely to write poetry?
Children of bad poets are more likely to divorce. - I worry

Bob,

    Perhaps could be an impetus for an on-line seminar,

<3ViTre Archive of Polypoetry has been founded by Enzo Minarelli in
1983. Its main role consists in gathering up systematically all that has
been produced by poetical experimentation both at the visual and oral
area (sound poetry, visual poetry) poetry performance and videopoetry.
The Archive has up to now reached an amount over the 500 hours of sound
poetry works which are collected in audiocassettes, records and CDs,
including all the italian poets and a well documented
range of the foreign ones. In the field of video-production, the Archive
collection includes under the target ‘Videopoetry’
about two hundred hours of programs belonging to italian and foreign
poets. Next to this cataloguing, 3Vitre Archive is involved in issuing
or editing records, audiocassettes and CDs. With the aim of promoting
even spreading the collected material, the Archive has been organizing
since the first Eighties several events related to the field of poetical
experimentation./>

Sorry, Bob,

that 'express' thing's just so close to 'self-expression' I get scared, I
see language sliding away into unconsciousness....

The question that I was muddily circling, like a carp on the bottom of a
murky pond in some zoo where there are a lot of ducks eating bread crusts,
is:

Does poetry express?
and its twin: Do words express?

To say that a textual poem that vividly brings to life some visual image is
"expressive-of-the-visual" doesn't sound right to me. It seems to me that
the poem is the visual, just as a painting is visual. It doesn't stand at a
remove from it. The painting can be representational or not, but it is
always visual, although it is not un-mediated perception. It's a structure
that sets up the possibility of transfer of certain information.

On the other hand, such a textual poem is not the same as one where the
actual visual layout of components on the page or screen or brick wall or
wherever is transferring the information. You're right, some distinction
needs to be made.

I just don't see the two as being as different as I sense you do. I have a
sense that it is the same impulse, with different tools, different viewing
mechanisms, different technology. In that regard, the poem laid out
visually, the concrete poem, for instance, is also
"expressive-of-the-visual". If that's the case, I doubt the term is doing
the work you're asking of it.

I can't do it, Bob. I can't use that word in good conscience. I'm trying,
but I'm cringing here.

Let me try again: "Ex  p p pp    rrr    e          sssssssssssss!"

Hurts.

As for words being... "that word" ...well, I've thought for a few years now
that they were containers, holding material. A kind of shorthand. Say
"tree", you get a vast history of usage and perception. Plunk it down.
Stick something next to it. Pretty soon, the mind can wander through this
world, and it is the world, but perceived differently than with biological
technology. That's not "that word", though. It's visual, but differently
visual.

It's like divining by throwing coloured beans on a cloth.

If the mind's not obsessed with a conception of 'self', then this "that
word" thing is not right. It's a transitional term, then. I'd like to see
some term which speaks of what is actually going on, because it's a very
interesting story.

"meta-visual" doesn't say what's going on, really, but it doesn't use "that
word". Could it serve as a temporary substitute, like a sticky note, with a
grocery list scribbled on it?

I mean no disrespect. On the contrary, your taxonomies are always most
useful. In this case, I think there's more going on.

Cheers,

Harold

Tom:

Some kind of online seminar would be great (aside from the possible loss
of Danny's coffee and D A Powell's cookies).  Not as a counter-statement
but as a discussion would certainly be best if those hitherto ignoring
us would agree to participate.

As for the people in what I loosely refer to as my crowd, there ARE a
lot of them with no or difficult access to the web.  I myself have only
been connected to it for ten months.  Money is one problem, and
opposition to computers another.  But enough visual poets are on the web
to make it feasible.

The biggest problem would be getting participation--but I think if we
made it a continuing seminar it could work.  People offline could mail
me statements.  So, without thinking it through AT ALL, here's
what I suggest:

1.  I set up a URL for people to go to, to post a statement in answer
to some Interesting Question.  People without access to the web could
mail their responses to me, Bob Grumman, 1708 Hayworth Road, Port
Charlotte FL 33952.

2.  For Interesting Question, I propose: "What is your take on the
current American/Canadian/World visual poetry scene?"

3.  I'd collect but not post responses until they'd built up to a fair
size.  Then I'd put them up unedited--but, maybe, with some attempt to
put them into some kind of order . . . sort them by attitude, say.

4.  Same thing for responses to the initial statements.

Another possibility would be to post some relevant essay and have people
respond to that.

One odd problem: GeoCities, where my website is, is currently down, so
who knows when I could do anything.  I'm quite up about it, though.

                                                             Bob G.

"I'm a poet
I know it
Hope I don't blow it"  --Dylan


Mandel's exclusionary categorical ambitions are pointless at best.  The
argument over (between) Dylan VERSUS poetry doesn't go anywhere
productive.    "Other serious artists"--"artists" include painters,
musicians, poets, doesn'tt it?

Being a gray-beard, I heard and wrote down the lyrics of Dylan songs just
at the moment (in the 60s) that they arrived, and they seemed like poetry
to me.  Also Ginsberg chanting/singing with a harmonium seemed like poetry
to me.

Derrida had a lot to say about the false primacy of orality over writing.
("idealized oral antiquity"--Kasey Silem Mohammad Hicks)

On the other hand, Blood on the Tracks seemed like a let down to me, kind
of toward a country music dirrection...

Highway 61, going electric, "Like a Rolling Stone" seemed like one of the
major high points....

children of poets are twice as likely to write poor briefs in law school

Attacking langpo--or the people involved--is not only self
defeating but shows only the limitations and prejudices of the attacker.
(wake up Joe Safdie)

I like Watten.  I even lived with him for a month or two.

But that's another poem, and
I haven't got time to be a dumb brat

Good post on your reaction to the word, "express," Harold.  I guess I'm
just more of a reductionist than you: "expression" is completely
different to me from "self-expression."  Anyway, "expressive-of-the-
visual" is not a taxonomic term of mine, just an ad hoc way of
describing textual poems that are, how 'bout "visually-descriptive?" but
not therefore visual.  But they do more than describe; they add
emotional over/under-tones.  So they express.  Or we could call such
poems visio-advertive.  See, now you've gotten me into my addiction to
neologizing.  I now think maybe at the lowest level of my taxonomy
(which does not classify by subject-matter yet but at the lowest level,
I guess, might) "visio-advertive," "audio-advertive" (poetry about
music, say), "mathadvertive," etc., might work.

I don't see words as containers but (very old-fashionedly) as tags.
They make you remember what you've perceived in the past.  I would claim
your brain has "tree" stored somewhere, and that when you read it, the
"knowlecule" (as I call it in my theory of the mind, which is even
nuttier than my poetics) in your brain for "tree" straight-forwardly
links to all the knowlecules there that have anything to do with trees,
the strength of any particular link depending on context.  For instance,
now "tree" will probably not be making you think of some particular
tree that you climbed as a kid--as its repetition just now possibly
does.  This all probably sounds simple-minded and, I think, is.  I hope
it gives you an idea of where I'm coming from, though.

        First, I'd like to thank Luigi for sending on a useful and
"important" (I realize Jordan Davis wd. like to purge this word--but
beware those who urge to purge!)--list of journals and web sites to start
finding out about visual poetry.  I shd note, that besides the CORE
anthology , Crag Hill (with Spencer Selby) has done some magnificent
issues year in and year out of SCORE--as well, Harry Burrus's great
journal
O!!ZONE also had a 97 edition, which Luigi may not have mentioned--
        So--thanks, Luigi! And to put in a plug for you--Luigi's Taproot
Review has continually covered visual poetry productions--
        I want to say that I whole heartedly agree with Bob Grumman's
points re the class being presented by Dr. Perloff. As a participant in
visual poetry and mail art, I am always of two minds--first--it would be
great if there were more recognition for visual poets and mail artists.
Second--maybe it is better not to be recognized! Except amongst ourselves
and the ever growing network of fellow artists and poets, the people like
Karl Young who have put in years of work and love and faith in their
publishing, organizing of shows and  web
sites--and there is it sometimes seems almost weekly an ever growing
number of sites--the people who put out the mail art and visual poetry
calls and organize the exhibitions and performances, make and print the
catlogues and send out the documentation--maybe it is best, in the spirit
of this activity, that the graduate  seminars just handle  what is
--easier to handle--that is,  work in the more "aco-dominant" (to use A
Gurmman taxonomic phrase) vein--because this work "fits" better (the issue
of the shoehorn brought up . . . should we consult the former First Lady
of the Phillipines in this regard . . or Nike . . .)--and makes things
easier for
theoretical discourse, which often can recognize only the objects it has
already described, or those which mirror and echo in the proscribed manner
its rules . . .
        re the issue of being able to bring people for one reason or
another to give readings--as I believe Bob pointed out, and I know from
experience, as long as there is a place to sleep and a kettle on, well,
visual poets will come-one way or another!--(ask jwcurry who rides the
rails, hopping freights--)
        The issue Bob is trying to bring up--I hope I understand it?--is
that
now seems to be the moment when suddenly after a long period of lack of
interest on the part of the academic community, there is now a kind of
flare up of what hopefully is not simply a faddish interst in visual
poetry--and, in that perhaps brief moment, there will be a kind of
institutionalizing and narrowing, a categorization and canonization (for
all the academic world's wanting to do away with the canon--it seems they
are continually inventing new sub canons, making a Byzantine world Borges
would have enjoyed writing some stories about!)-which will put in place a
kind of accepted criteria and curriculum of visual poetry--and once again,
the vast and vibrant and vital world of visual poetry--this will be passed
by--much as in a city square for example, full of life, a tourist might
pause before the monuments in the center, erected by the powers that be,
and consider this, consulting the guidebook and taking a few photos and
notes--and pass on--while all that was quite possibly quite well alive in
that moment--the movements of the people, the voices, the spontaneous
outbreaks of music or painting on walls, or recitations by contemporary
zaumi--all this--is washed away with the sand--

        but then again--perhaps it is better to be in the sun,
continually, though it may to others appear to be shade--than to have a
"moment in the sun"  that is only a snapshot to be pinned down like a
beetle on a dusty shelf . . .

Subject:      Some questions for Don Byrd
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Following up on comments made by Don Byrd, Louis Cabri, and Doug
Barbour about reading and talking about what we read:

Don-- I believe that for the past number of years you have been part
of an informally-knit community of poets that has been seriously
discussing a range of works. I have heard through the
grapevine that this group has included Robert Kelly, Charles Stein,
Jed Rasula, George Quasha, Elizabeth Robinson (?) among others. I
wonder if you might say something here about that "experience," what
such a poetic and intellectual community has meant to you and others
involved, what some of the key focusings of your discussions were,
and so on. In other words, what did you _read_ that that community
(is "community" the appropriate word?) came to feel was indispensable
to a serious grounding in poetics? I realize that  _The Poetics of
the Common Knowledge_ would stand as a "full" answer to these
questions, but that incredible book is an answer of a labyrinth-like,
very demanding kind (I myself have been reading the book off and on
for a few months and am able to move only very slowly with it). So
would it be possible for you to share here some of those readings
that have been of most importance for you and to others you are close
to?

And also: When you call for real discussion here around
books that "five" or more people have read, do you think that this
electronic medium is enough? What I mean is that I have this image of
a small group of poets in upstate NY talking about poetry in
somewhat domestic settings, where you heard each others' voices and
laughter, watched the ways each other moved, shared food and drink,
listened to music, touched the books you were talking about,
embraced one another in hello or goodbye, and that all that is,
however sentimental and nostalgic it sounds, an intrinsic
part of the true flowering of reading and community-- something that
is not just incidental, but something to be sought out and cultivated
as _necessary_, because such "sensuous" collective dimensions to
reading enter and make deeper and more tangible one's particular
_understanding_.

Maybe I'm sounding like a bad imitation of Sven Birkerts, and maybe
the questions are fairly old and uninteresting. But if I'm at all
saying anything relevant, what about the above, and what about this
amorphous, fairly impersonal space we are now in? Can we really talk
on the Buffalo Poetics list-- in the way that we would need to
talk--about _reading_ a poet like Jack Clarke?

        First, I'd like to thank Luigi for sending on a useful and
"important" (I realize Jordan Davis wd. like to purge this word--but
beware those who urge to purge!)--list of journals and web sites to start
finding out about visual poetry.  I shd note, that besides the CORE
anthology , Crag Hill (with Spencer Selby) has done some magnificent
issues year in and year out of SCORE--as well, Harry Burrus's great
journal
O!!ZONE also had a 97 edition, which Luigi may not have mentioned--
        So--thanks, Luigi! And to put in a plug for you--Luigi's Taproot
Review has continually covered visual poetry productions--
        I want to say that I whole heartedly agree with Bob Grumman's
points re the class being presented by Dr. Perloff. As a participant in
visual poetry and mail art, I am always of two minds--first--it would be
great if there were more recognition for visual poets and mail artists.
Second--maybe it is better not to be recognized! Except amongst ourselves
and the ever growing network of fellow artists and poets, the people like
Karl Young who have put in years of work and love and faith in their
publishing, organizing of shows and  web
sites--and there is it sometimes seems almost weekly an ever growing
number of sites--the people who put out the mail art and visual poetry
calls and organize the exhibitions and performances, make and print the
catlogues and send out the documentation--maybe it is best, in the spirit
of this activity, that the graduate  seminars just handle  what is
--easier to handle--that is,  work in the more "aco-dominant" (to use A
Gurmman taxonomic phrase) vein--because this work "fits" better (the issue
of the shoehorn brought up . . . should we consult the former First Lady
of the Phillipines in this regard . . or Nike . . .)--and makes things
easier for
theoretical discourse, which often can recognize only the objects it has
already described, or those which mirror and echo in the proscribed manner
its rules . . .
        re the issue of being able to bring people for one reason or
another to give readings--as I believe Bob pointed out, and I know from
experience, as long as there is a place to sleep and a kettle on, well,
visual poets will come-one way or another!--(ask jwcurry who rides the
rails, hopping freights--)
        The issue Bob is trying to bring up--I hope I understand it?--is
that
now seems to be the moment when suddenly after a long period of lack of
interest on the part of the academic community, there is now a kind of
flare up of what hopefully is not simply a faddish interst in visual
poetry--and, in that perhaps brief moment, there will be a kind of
institutionalizing and narrowing, a categorization and canonization (for
all the academic world's wanting to do away with the canon--it seems they
are continually inventing new sub canons, making a Byzantine world Borges
would have enjoyed writing some stories about!)-which will put in place a
kind of accepted criteria and curriculum of visual poetry--and once again,
the vast and vibrant and vital world of visual poetry--this will be passed
by--much as in a city square for example, full of life, a tourist might
pause before the monuments in the center, erected by the powers that be,
and consider this, consulting the guidebook and taking a few photos and
notes--and pass on--while all that was quite possibly quite well alive in
that moment--the movements of the people, the voices, the spontaneous
outbreaks of music or painting on walls, or recitations by contemporary
zaumi--all this--is washed away with the sand--

        but then again--perhaps it is better to be in the sun,
continually, though it may to others appear to be shade--than to have a
"moment in the sun"  that is only a snapshot to be pinned down like a
beetle on a dusty shelf . . .

Doug, I yield to you in this matter. After all, you did give us the "Bad
Poetry manifesto" a few years ago.(Would you post it to this List?) De
gustibus non disputandum would be my motto, except that questions of taste
are what people persecute one another for all over the world, all the time.
"One [person's] meat is another [person's] poison" makes more sense. I
can't believe what some people think is good poetry, and I cant even
believe that I once thought such-&-such was good poetry, because today it
strikes me as bad. Here in California (as you know), one strives for the
value-free evaluation : "It's all part of the pile . . "  But I really
would like a dollar back from the State for each bad poetry reading I've
sat through--I could send my kids to graduate school. "Used" language or
whatever the wcw quote was (it's hidden behind my own message-in-progress,
and I can't be bothered to look for it)--well, Flaubert's "Dictionary of
Received Ideas", and the recent take on it from The Impercipient, are both
marvelous fun. It's all in how we use used language. Poetry recycles
language, we cd say.

"O spade, wherewith Wilkinson hath delved,"--I think I have that right--is
bad, dont you agree? And it's Wordsworth. A lot of bad poetry turns up
intermittently among not-so-bad  poetry. Theres plenty of it in my oeuvre.
Its the unremittingly bad that knocks the stuffing out of a reader/auditor.


I do wonder that people think they can write (good) poetry without knowing
the equivalent of scales & chords. Just because we talk all our lives, but
most of us seldom sing, I guess. What _is_ the equivalent of scales &
chords?  It cd be writing sonnets & pantoums & villanelles, or it cd be
reading 50 books of poetry published before 1940. But all the scales and
chords there are, wont necessarily produce surprising/pleasing/stimulating
music. Me, I'm going to lie on the couch and read William MacGonnigal. Go
for it! David

Did I neglect to name Rae Armantrout? And the humor is right there in the
poems, too! (Often, not the case : e.g. Robert Duncan was a barrel of
laughs improv'ing conversation or annotating verbally twixt poems at a
reading, but his poetry doesn't have much to laugh about does it, except in
a couple poems.) Not that humor is everything. But then again, I recall the
time when Jack Hirschman said to Sherril Jaffe, after her reading, "Good,
but not enough pain"--to which she responded, "Well, pain isn't everything,
you know, Jack."

I had better issue a disclaimer at this point, to the effect that I know I
am forgetting to name other langpoets who can make me laugh, but that
enough is as good as a feast, & that I've already posted more than is good
for me--or anyone else--to the List today (yesterday, Wednesday . . .).

Oh, I agree!  And Matthew Stadler is right that the piece is from _The
Onion_, which is why I helpfully posted the URL.  Tom Bell asks "What is
BAD POETRY?"  I doubt I have the critical apparatus to answer that one,
but "The Purple Lake of Desolation," reproduced (complete with angry
cross-outs) in the piece, is at least Exhibit A.

So again:

http://www.theonion.com/onion3301/divorcepoetry.html

"Wasserbaum urged America's troubled couples to split up while their
children are still very young. 'If you have children who are, say,
between the ages of three and nine, and you suspect you might not want
to spend the rest of your life with your spouse, I would urge you to get
divorced now,' he said. 'At least that way, your kids have a fighting
chance to heal emotionally before they reach their prime poetry-writing
teenage years, and we can all be spared reading about a beautiful rose
that withers and dies because no sunlight ever fell upon it.'"

Well, as David's already officially signed off the list for the weekend,
I guess I can go ahead and try to respond to some of his comments three
or four posts ago. (By the way, thanks A LOT to all who backchanneled me
about this post; I do think Mark Leyner's piece I appended at the top is
pretty great -- especially considering humor and those who have it, or
don't -- and I'll be glad to furnish that to anyone who couldn't get it.
And David Benedetti: I'm awake, thanks. Glad to hear that any adverse
comments about langpo are automatically invalid: is that on one of your
computer programs? It's a real honor to hear from someone with no
limitations or predudices).

It wasn't that _I_ wanted to be acknowledged; it was exactly a matter of
"ideological difference" -- certain poets and ideas and poetic theories
that I valued were being ignored, trampled upon even, in the name of
something altogether more narrow and petty.

        But really, David, I thank you for this post and all your posts.
As I tried to say in my summation, I don't quite feel the same way about
"langpo" as I did in the early 80s -- I don't, for example, feel anymore
(as I did then) that it's a phenomenon that can be treated carte
blanche. I try (in the context of my many prejudices and limitations, of
course) to give everything that crosses my path an honest look. But I
resisted then, as I hope I would now, any so-called "movement" that
wanted to sweep away what had gone before in its triumphal path; the
Tradition is important to me. Sometimes I think it's all we have --
"liberating the past from the future" as a current essay contest says.
This is getting a little too watery for my own tastes so I'll stop. Only
one more thing: is Michael Boughn not on this list anymore? What
happened to the Jack Clarke sub-group? (where we had, Don, in fact
started to talk about _In The Analogy_ in a fairly substantive way!)

well, the modem's been down for two days and i'm just now able to get back

mobius here, sorry) / but, in the spirit of challenging perhaps over-taxed
taxonomies, what if, for example, you put a poem about an external work
online and then link to that work (let's assume it's a work of visual art
built for online display), i wonder whether or not that other-sited work
would then become part, by hypertextual appropriation, of the poem / could
we then call the whole thing a "visual poem"? (skirting temporarily, if i
may, the idea that anything "on screen" is visual anyway) / bob, i know i'm
giving you grief with my own terminology, but my own word for this--freely
absorbing or integrating stuff off the web into singular works (or v.v.

Oh God, Don Byrd on growing (not old but) middle aged! I wont go on in
agreement about that, but realize that yes indeed I did read Clarke's
massive opus & was taken many places. Why didnt I mention it too? Because
one of the facts of aging is forgetfulness I guess. I only read it once --
so far. And that means I havent done the 'curriculum' much yet at all, but
it tempts me & I can hope I'll find the time.

I read mina loy, the new Lost Lunar Baedeker, really for the first time;
after so many others. So that whole string about the variousness of
different individuals' sense of 'poetic history [ies]' makes a lot of sense
to me. I found the Black Mountain group before I really read the Beats &
that was really important to me (but I did so because there was a copy of
Olson's Maximus 1-20 in a small bookshop in Halifax (!), & then I found a
copy of The Opening of the Field on sale in Montreal, & only then did The
New American Poetry turn up among my writing friends. And only later did I
really begin to read Canadians, meet bpNichol & begin to devour everything
of his as it arrived. Oh yeah, since so many of you here know him, George
Bowering's work (& that of many of the writers associated with the action
on the west coast promoted by the Vancouver conference of 63 [which i only
read about later -- sob]) has shone, Daphne Marlatt's, Fred Wah's, etc. And
so on. The sense I have of recent poetry is therefore different than that
of many people I know personally, let alone those I've read here. What I
know is not what you know. You know?

These birdseeds landed on my snow:

-I share Kent Johnson's uncertainty or curiosity about the ways in which
"community" has been used in the visual poetry thread, given the ways in which
that poetry is produced and distributed, and wonder if anyone feels committed
enough to a specific definition of it to explain why anyone else should honor
an appeal to it as a term.  The matter of Perloff's syllabus and her appeal
to logistics got me thinking about how universities sit in "communities."
In them still, solicitation of transhistorical and transnational knowledge,
however incoherent or incomplete, is different from acknowledging a social
ecology in the name of facillitating praxis (which doesn't meant that knowledge
and praxis are binaries, even in an academic course).

-Ann Lauterbach's On a Stair is another '97 product worth mentioning, even
if it does have the mark of the penguin upon it.

-If Bruce Andrews has not yet been named re:humor, then why not?  Don't know
the man, never saw him, can't testify as to his courtesies and conviviality,
but his party-mouth, howsoever juvenal, cracks my ass.  Chfuck the opacity
business, he is a laugh riot in here age of satire.

-Hendrix's long live version of his song "Machine Gun" is the definitive
statement on the guitar-as-battle ax, and deserves to be as well known as his
"Star-spangled banner": the cadenza at the end of it gives me chills every time
I listen.

Gotto go shovel now.

Bill, I love "transpiracy!"

As for your question about what to call "for example . . .a poem about
an external work online (that's linked) link to that work (let's assume
it's a work of visual art built for online display," I say it's just a
captioned illumage (work of visual art)--or an illustrated poem.  I
think my Official Taxonomy has more awkward terms for this, but I can't
remember them right now, and can't access my site, which is at
GeoCities, which is having temporary problems.  I wouldn't call such a
combination a visual poem.  Also, I wouldn't call anything onscreen
visual.

Thanks for the response, Bill.  At times like this I wish there were
some way to allow readers of a thread to signify interest or
non-interest.  I truly wonder if our chat is interesting more than three
or four other people.  I'm having fun, though!

I have recently, with an entirely rational purpose, read Norman Mailer's
lengthy novel ANCIENT EVENINGS which is, as no doubt everyone on the list
knows, set in Pharonic Egypt.  It seemed to me entirely a product of its
time, the mid 70s, or roughly from Watergate through the Iranian hostage
crisis (to use mediated history as a marker), i.e., the conscious attempt
to "get in the ring" with (in this case) Thomas Mann, the apparent total
disconnect from life as it was going on around the author in favor of a
total connect with literary models, the persistence of the author's
signature characteristics (there's a lot of buttfucking and shit smelling
in ANCIENT EVENINGS), etc.

Then I thought how Allen Ginsberg during the same historical period
seemed to respond to similar aesthetic impulses, Contest of Bards being
the main exhibit (shall I become Milton!) though the neo-Elizabethan
songs of that period (Love's Answer, etc) are more delightful to my own
tastes.  Again, its a conscious effort to make "literature" according to
some received definition of what constitutes literature.

Now, this is the same period that saw the beginnings of soi-disant
language school poetry, whether in California or New York.  My question
for the list is, was langpo equally part of this same period style,
the deliberate invention of an avant garde poetics according to a recipe
for what ought to constitute an avant garde poetics, just as Mailer is
writing what everybody knows is what a "great" novel is supposed to be.
(With Allen its a little more complicated, he knew he had already made
great poetry, then I think he wanted to see if he could make great poetry
as defined by somebody else, or, to answer the questioner a hundred years
hence who asks, what if Allen Ginsberg had tried to write like Milton.)

I guess what I am driving at is whether we can define this 70s period
style as some kind of "naive programmatic" or "systematic rangement of
the sensibility"

any rocks?

At the end of an acid trip once (this was **not** in the Sixties o
graybeards) someone played "It's Alright Ma, I'm Only Bleeding," and when it
was over another friend said, "Oh so that's what the void's like."

I think about '66 Dylan saw something that scared him so bad he just had to
back away. Hence country music and all the rest.

Like you, David B, I think Dylan going electric was one of the Really Big
Deals. I'm not kidding. I think what happened with Dylan, the Band, and
electricity after Newport '65 probably changed the world. And when I finally
heard it (in '75, through the hiss of a faraway and drifting Canadian
all-night station), it certainly changed me.

On the other hand, I met a woman once who claimed to have spent the night
with Dylan in a camper parked on Sixth Street in Austin. Desperate for
gossip, insight, whatever, I said, well tell me, what happened. It was
awful, she said, he made me chew tobacco.

Once after a reading by a Famous Language Poet in San Francisco, my friend
Len walked up to the poet and said, wow that was great, here's your
pineapple. And he handed her a pineapple. Would it have been better if he
had saved his pineapple for, say, Galway Kinnell, or Marvin Bell, or James
Merrill? Or is it best just to go ahead and give away pineapples when the
mood hits, even if the only poet there is a Language Poet?

Importance is the closest thing to money in poetry.

The Taylor Mead retrospective, for those of you within the blast radius of
Manhattan Penal Colony, still has two shows to go, next Saturday and
Sunday. You missed seeing Ed Sanders and Jack Smith cavort with my
hometown's favorite native goof in Ron Rice's The Queen of Sheba Meets the
Atom Man. Shot on surplus gun film, it's just gorgeously gray New York
from the ice on the East River to Taylor taking a big swig of wheat germ.
A useful counterbalance to the Rudy Burckhardt film program last Tuesday
at the New York Studio School where Kevin Davies' rule about poetry events
in New York held true -- if it's Langpo, show up ten minutes late, if it's
New York School, get there fifteen minutes early.

a question to the list, particularly those on the icy side of the
Canadian border;
I was told the other day of an essay by Frank Davey which dealt with
'readerly consumption' and or the reader as consumer; I have been
unable to locate it in our library here and  wonder if anyone can
point me in the right direction; (thanks in advance)

in response to those musings as to how many people were interested in
the Visual Poetics debate, I for one have been following it, and am
only waiting for some time to follow up the online links;

Don's right of course. People build knowledge a world together of shared
contexts. Otherwise everyone is just opining into the stream.

Thanks to Kasey for pointing that yes there is more to the subject I said I
couldn't really begin to explore because of how much more there was. If
only this listserv could pass realaudio I'd be looking forward to the c&m
"do not go gentle...." Anything changes anything, you bet. That is the
point. But by direct access to the poem I didn't mean an occasion for
theorizing but just that, me and the poem rather than me and the night and
the music.

Greil Marcus is a fuddy-duddy and always has been. I remember a dinner out
with him one night in the late seventies. He wore a blue 3 piece
pin-striped Brooks Brothers makers (the expensive kind) suit, paraded his
educational qualifications and polysyllabic capacities (natch i blew him
away on both counts) and seemed to regard any thought he had as philosophy.
He did drive us to dinner, tho, in his new chug-chug Mercedes Benz Diesel.
As a guide to our era he really won't do. Baedeker's fine for the chapels,
don't ask him for an opinion on the dance-halls. Talk about received ideas!
Anybody read Sainte-Beuve lately? -- Greil's the Sainte-Beuve of our time,
at least.

Visions of Johanna is my favorite Dylan song too, Don. Send me an email and
we'll discuss it! Inside the museums / infinity goes up on trial.

Why don't we all know the same books, but we all know Dylan? For one thing,
in a world with thousands of poets "taste" (or any other personal filtering
term you like) becomes the active master. There's just a *huge* range out
there and no objective measuring device by which you can categorize or
otherwise order it. Despite (or the cause of?) theory. Dylan is in a
different world, one that's pushed at us. The money spent to market Dylan's
comeback album for example, who knows how much? And it worked (here we are
talking about it).

Joe Safdie calls the Allen anthology and the NY School anthology his
(twinned) "bible." No surprise, in that case, if he had trouble with the
Language Poetry scene in SF around the turn of 1980. It would be hard to
get along with people who felt they were the heirs of your bible and also
felt strong enough to critique it. Especially if they *were* strong enough
to critique people you "were fortunate enough to study with." This is *not*
the same as rejection of that tradition. It's just taking it away from you.
Moreso the Allen anthology than the NY school anthology, yet really both,
were seen as the place where the real past was collected, however. It was
Richard Wilbur, et. al. that came in for veritable scorn.

The following is a personal reaction: I find criticism of Barry's
"personality" annoying. "Priggish. Aloof. Supercilious. Contemptuous" Joe
Safdie calls him.

For one thing, such criticism seems to be used to prove something (what?).
For another, it is a reaction to the surface of a person to his
self-presentation and to a way of presenting self that is evidently not a
matter of personal control for anyone. We don't make what we look like nor
how we appear to others. Above all, it has literally nothing to do with
whether, for example, Barry is a good friend to his friends, to take a
simple example (he is). Nor with any other feature of his character.
Character not personality is what goes into making poems, because it is
what goes into making people.

Finally, it is a weak way of addressing whatever issue a person and his
work raises in your life and in your poetics. That is, there's no place to
go with it. Connecting someone's manner with their matter (assuming Joe has
even gotten to any essential of Watten's manner -- Barry always seemed more
awkward than contemptuous to me during those years, more preoccupied than
aloof) removes the need to craft a strong position on that matter, on
poetics. Where's the critique of the poetics? A series of conclusions (e.g.
it wasn't political even tho it thought it was, to paraphrase Joe) really
doesn't get very far.

Anyway, that's my personal reaction. I'm fond of Barry -- personally, and
of his work -- as I hope I am making clear.

I should add that Joe frames his personal reaction to Barry generously --
saying that he is pleased others feel differently, and pointing out himself
that his response has "the weight" of the personal. It was not to him but
precisely to weighting the issue of Watten or anyone's "personality" in an
understanding of poetics or work that I meant to be objecting. Actions,
works, statements, yes. Quotations please.

Hi David Benedetti -- haven't seen you in years. I wasn't trying to be
exclusive or even exclusivist or create some exclusivista which all must
see as me. Dylan pretty clearly, repeatedly, says he is not a poet. Doesn't
mean I'm trying to see Dylan VERSUS poetry as you put it.  I agree that's
pointless. Anyway, I listened to all those albums as intensely as all of us
did and had my view of the world shaped by my time, how the hell not? (and
why the hell not?), but... I don't see how Blood on the Tracks was a
diversion toward country? "Idiot Wind" -- sort of the signature song on the
album -- "Tangled up in Blue"? these don't seem "country" to me. I assume
it's not Nashville Skyline (*explicitly* country album) you mean?

Subject:      Oy and more on language poetry
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

It seems to me that Joe Safdie is being pretty straightforward in
discriminating between his reactions to Language Poetry then (early 80's)
and now. I think he offers us a model to discuss this (briefly I hope) w/o
being sucked back into the wars of that time.

A word on this remark by Joe, however:

"I resisted then, as I hope I would now, any so-called "movement" that
wanted to sweep away what had gone before in its triumphal path..."

Well, sure. But, I have no idea what this is about in reference to that
time. In fact, to my knowledge no one in the group of people who came
retroactively to be seen as a movement particularly regarded language
poetry as a movement at all. We did think we were investigating a way of
writing, but we also thought it was being investigated with a lot of
variety and that there was virtually no program for it whatever. There were
agreements of rejection certainly -- what we all or mostly all seemed not
to like (viz. Richard Wilbur, James Merrill -- *not* the Allen anthology!)
-- and of agreement (the Allen anthology, early Ashbery), and of
ambiguousness (Ashbery after The Tennis Court Oath). But even these
"agreements" were far from that. Frameworks for discussions that didn't
really have agreement as a goal at all.

I.e. there was some level of social self-consciousness among these people,
but it was not as a movement. As to "sweep away what had gone before..." I
can't begin to identify what is meant by this. Passion and a critique of
the past are not identical to a rejection of that past. They're not even
necessarily Oedipal (whatever in hell that mannish-boy theory-parable might
still imply for anyone). And as to "in its triumphal path" where might the
feeling of triumph have arisen?

Joes's sentence goes on:

"; the Tradition is important to me. Sometimes I think it's all we have..."

Well, I can identify with that and strongly. But how do you go on? An
example please where piety (that word is not being used sarcastically)
leads to innovation? I think I could point to one in the rabbinic Midrash
tradition. But there is a particular set of formal constraints which
follows, and, no matter how compelling that work is, it is limited in its
effect by those constraints.

We are limited by our own metaphors. We talk of "breaking new ground," but
there is always a life there destroyed by our plow. The tradition itself,
it's that kind of story.

Dan Zimmerman backchanneled me pointing out the contradiction -- blatant --

Greil Marcus... in the same post!

I have to plead guilty. I just couldn't stand the guy -- a rich little prig

Bob,

to your,

>>I don't see words as containers but (very old-fashionedly) as tags.
They make you remember what you've perceived in the past.<<

Tags is good.

But who is this 'you' perceiving in the past? I'd say the words had their
hand in it. This 'you' is a tool the words have made for their own ends,
no? Sure, this 'you' exists, but it is a very special meta-creature, and a
very powerful one. What happens when one moves away from the country of the
you into the country of the words?

>>I would claim
your brain has "tree" stored somewhere, and that when you read it, the
"knowlecule" (as I call it in my theory of the mind, which is even
nuttier than my poetics) in your brain for "tree" straight-forwardly
links to all the knowlecules there that have anything to do with trees,
the strength of any particular link depending on context.<<

My 12 year old daughter claims that if she wants to remember something, she
just has to visualize a general category, and then she sees the
sub-categories unfold below it, including, in the example of our tree,
every instance of tree she has encountered. She then searches through this
list of images, film-clips, and words, etc., until she lights upon what she
was looking for. Now, I find this remarkable and profound, but I know my
mind does not work like that. Mine is symbolic. There's a logic there, but
an entirely different one. I think that's what helps make this so
difficult: we don't all think the same.

>>This all probably sounds simple-minded and, I think, is.  I hope
it gives you an idea of where I'm coming from, though.<<

Not simple-minded. Was always clear.

This moves away from the original topic of community, but: This book has
long fascinated me, ever since I was introduced to it by Jed Rasula when he
was visiting faculty at Pomona College.  A close friend of mine, Dave Carl,
did a fair bit of work at giving a rational, bare-bones reconstruction of
what Chester Hennix is getting at in the portions of "The Yellow Book"
therein, and a while later a few of us got together for a day-long seminar
(that began at a breakfast joint and adjourned to a community center)
discussing these themes (diagnoalization, etc.).  Who exactly Hennix is has
remained a bit mysterious to me.  Don, would you be willing to fill me and
the list in with some info about him and how he fit into that community--Jed
told me some things, but my memory's
shaky.  Also, is there any other writing by or about him out there to be
tracked down?  Finally, while I'm at it, is the redoubtable Mr. Rasula
emailable?  (Backchannel is fine on the last.)

Oh--for comparisons sake, '97 poetry I've read and enjoyed has included
Moxley's "Imagination Verses," Damon Kruskowski's "5000 Musical Terms"
(maybe that was '96), Watten's "Frame," Jordan Davis' "Upstairs," the book
of Lyn Hejinian's "A Border Comedy" that appeared as a chapbook from Seeing
Eye, Heather Fuller's "perhaps this is a rescue mission," Ron Padgett's "New
And Selected Poems," Dennis Philips' "Credence," Jim Brodey's "Heart of the
Breath" (96?), Campbell McGrath's "Spring Comes to Chicago," & Joshua
Clover's "Madonna Anno Domini."  These last two I've tried to bring up on
the list with no success, which fuels my nagging suspicion that my
list-capital is so low as to make my interests appear beneath collective
contempt, but no matter.  I've read around in Mark Wallace's "Sonnets of A
Penny-A-Liner" (haven't seen his even more recent book), and recent books by
Jarnot (96?), Mandel, and Piombino, but not thoroughly enough to add them
honestly to the above list.  Lastly, I'm currently dealing w/ Fanny Howe's
"One Crossed Out," which showed up in the bookstore about 2 weeks before the
end of the year.

Why my two cents?  Why not?  Oh, and the Dylan is good not great and the
years' best lyrics, poetry or not, were by Belle and Sebastian.

Oh, boy, Harold, you iz really pushin' me!  The you--"this 'you'
perceiving in the past? I'd say the words had their hand in it. This
'you' is a tool the words have made for their own ends, no?"  No, not as
far as I can see.  For me the you, let's call it the mind, is just there
listening in on the brain, passively (although it might be part of it,
or even all of it).  As for the brain's "me," it is, I believe, an
innate knowlecule (or urceptual complex, how's that?) that has to do
with the brain's visceral perception, so to speak, of the body it's
globbed to.  The brain is what might move from the country of the mind
or you into some other country, such as the country of words.  As I see
that's no more than watching a silent movie and being in visuality, then
closing one's eyes and turning on some music to go
into the country of aurality.  The you/mind is in the country of the
self.  There's also the country of words, which for people more Evelyn
Wooden than I might be pure words--one word going to another with a
trace of visual involvement but nothing else.  For me the country of
words includes fragments of sub-vocalization and sound.

More about this will have to wait my finally writing down
the basics of my theory--or, more exactly--turning my notes into some
kind of finished monograph.

As for remembering something, that's more mechanical, more the result of
training, and we all have our own remembering strategies.  Well, except
for me.  I don't remember nuttin'.

    Christer Hennix is a Swedish mathematician, composer, philosopher--a concept
artist--who lived in the U.S. for a number of years.  He is one of the great
originals.  I must say that my struggle to understand his work, which is deeply
embedded in mathematics that I do not have the background for,  left a permanent
mark on not just my thinking but my way of perceiving.  In his Introduction,
Chuck Stein notes, "...the theoretical structures of the text build up
structures from fundamentally empty concepts and collapse all the structures
generated back into a recapitulated emptiness at the end (while at the same time
allowing a phantasmagorically rich array of mathematical sturctures and
possibilities to shimmer before the contemplating intellect in passing).   To
witness this process, even as one who does not command the necessary topology
and category theory, is to begin to have some idea what "structure"  might mean,
if one goes to the trouble to get ones language clear enough that it means any
thing.

    He and Henry Flynt  define concept art as working with concepts as material
(as a composer works with sound), as opposed to conceptual artists, who, from
their point of view, merely illustrate concepts. There is an web site devoted to
Flynt's work, including his Concept Art manifesto and his essay summarizing
Hennix's career.

                    http://www.butterfly.net/henryflynt/index.html

    Hennix has been back in Europe for a number of years, and sadly I missed him
when he lectured at  Dia in NY last fall.  Chuck Stein said that his vocabulary
is heavily Lacanian these days, but that the concepts are still those explored
in "The Yellow Book," in _Being =Space x Action_.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

To pick up the reading thread again:

When I first read Joseph Ceravolo's Transmigration Solo years ago (followed
closely by Coolidge's Quartz Hearts), I gasped, "I've never read anything
like this before!" I was utterly delighted by its originality, not in the
least concerned that I couldn't identify or describe the mechanisms of that
orginality. It was pleasurable simply to experience, a joyful romp of
language.

Reading Brian Schorn's Strabismus (from Burning Deck, 1995), I had a
similar experience. I don't know how the hell he's doing what he's doing,
nor did I want to break off the experience to analyze it - so rarely
recently have I found poetry "pleasurable" in any sense. But now as I think
about the poems and re-read them, the root of this pleasure has to be in
the many impossible, improbable, unpredictable lines and sentences that
build up the poems -- accretion of the unexpected: "Temperatures are
convincing jerks between the people in the canoe, hence, their legs support
them like four broken ferns." I beg your pardon? I ask, a smile on my
reading face. "I am the plaid formation on a Midwestern bow tie,
capsized/somewhere on a whitecap, say/Lake Michigan." I've been there, seen
that, I think. No, I haven't, though I grew up on the western shores of
Lake Michigan. I haven't been there, but those lines are. "Hands entwined
around each end of a wine bottle will not enhance the greenery of a swamp."
Well, yes, but...These poems are delightful. That's a hell of a place to
start.

Where have others gone with Strabismus?

Best, Crag Hill

my reading of community is that it has always formed the backbone to all
my interactions with other visual poets & mailartists, that the
networking & the making contact, knowing who was out there, being
attracted to the work of some, where the networking between us is an
enduring link. (for instance just these last weeks meeting artists whom
I havent heard from in 5-10 years as they slowly join the electronic
parade (why are the poets the last to tool up?))

unlike Mr Bob in the far south, Im quite uncomfortable with categories &
terms, especially when something about the term's nature suggests a
generality that yet remains exclusive.  & especially I contend with many
of the best works, their vibrancy is partly in the way the work defies a
branding. my personal bias when using the term "visual poetry" is that
historically & in practice large sectors of various visual poetry
movements such as zaum, lettrism, fluxus, & mail art were foremost
interested in transcending nationality.

being a founder of a real life community, my relation to that word is
experiential.  access, participation, mutual aid.  if I am a grad
student in a seminar,my question would be: is the model of community
something that is dynamic that I can participate in (as in summerhill
style open classroom) or a static appointment with information retrieval
which ends when the course is over?

to me the analogy is comparable to studying a computer manual to learn a
software program & then not actually using the program for its intended
purpose.

THINK OF THE SELF SPEAKING: Selected Interviews of Harry Smith

Introduction by Allen Ginsberg

Elbow and Cityful Press announce the first book collection of interviews
by the filmmaker, painter and archivist, Harry Smith. Over 30 years of his
life, Smith came back to the inteview as a medium for his brand of thought
and expression. These interviews reveal the genius of the man and his
contribution to arts and letters.

Harry Everett Smith was born May 29th, 1923 in Portland, Oregon. His early
childhood was spent in the Pacific Northwest- Bellingham, Anacortes,
Seattle and Portland. He attended University of Washington until before
his move to Berkeley, California in 1948. While in Berkeley he began
extensively painting and filmmaking. Smith based much of his work in the
non-objectivist style of Bauer and Kandinsky. In 1951 he received an
invitation from Hilla Rebay of the Museum of Non-Objectivist art. He also
received a Guggenheim, which allowed for him to move to New York City to
pursue film and painting.

Primarily recognized as a filmmaker, Smith's innovations in hand-painting,
collage, and batiking directly on film continue to influence on filmmakers
today. His immense 78 album collection culminated in the "Anthology of
American Music" [Re-released by Smithsonian Folkways].


Smith's range of discussion in "Think of the Self Speaking" includes:
painting, music, film, the occult, anthropology and his early childhood in
the northwest.

UK Poet Hughes Breaks Silence Over Sylvia Plath

LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - British poet Ted Hughes, vilified for more
than 30 years over the suicide of his wife Sylvia Plath, has broken
his silence by publishing a collection of startling love poems about
the affair.

A collection of 88 poems called "Birthday Letters" written at
intervals over the past 35 years, depict Hughes's love for Plath since
their first meeting and in the years after her suicide.

Described by one poet and critic on Saturday as "a thunderbolt from
the blue" the poems reveal for the first time Hughes's account of one
of the century's most tragic literary love stories.

<snip>

The Times newspaper on Saturday published a selection of the new
poems, which are to be published on January 29.

<snip>

The Times in an editorial called the collection "the greatest book by
our greatest living writer."

"For 30 years Sylvia Plath's pain has been public knowledge... Now, in
an autobiographical sequence that forms the finest work of his life,
Ted Hughes brings his own pain into the open. he has taken a risk --
and should win full reward," the newspaper said.

I'm with Meikal about community--with regard to visual poets, mail
artists, poets-in-general, artists-in-general . . .  (who are among the
last to tool up because they are among the last to be able to afford
to).  Community is what pastes Miekal and me together despite our
opposed feelings about categories and terms.

Yes, "access, participation, mutual aid."

As for terms, I say against Miekal that if a term's nature does not
suggest "a generality that yet remains exclusive," what's the point of
it?  A term, in the final analysis, is just a word, and words--all
words--are what we use to communicate to others, "this, not that."
About individual terms we can of course argue, and the foolishly
judgemental use of them we should condemn.

More odious than startling, judging from the three poems available on
the _Times_ site yesterday.  In the second one, he refers to her
"African-lipped, laughing, thickly / Crimson-painted mouth . . ."  In
the third, there's this:

        And I became aware of the mystery
        Of your lips, like nothing before in my life,
        Their aboriginal thickness. And of your nose,
        Broad and Apache, nearly a boxer's nose,
        Scorpio's obverse to the Semitic eagle
        That made every camera your enemy,
        The jailor of your vanity, the traitor
        In your Sexual Dreams Incorporated,
        Nose from Attila's horde: a prototype face
        That could have looked up at me through the smoke
        Of a Navajo campfire.

I mean, what, no tittering lotus blossoms, no Mexican spitfires, while
we're throwing in the kitchen sink?  Haven't had this particular chill
since coming across words like "Negress" and "Jewess."  Which is to say,
not in a long time.

I agree entirely with Crag Hill about Schorn's work, it's terrific.  However
I don't see Schorn's achievement as being an isolated -- or entirely unique
-- one.  Its peculiar collagist sensibility seems related to a lot of work
being published by Burning Deck.  For instance Lisa Jarnot's extraordinary
verbal collage *Some Other Kind of Mission* seems to me an important
breakthrough for post-Langpo writing.  A breakthrough I see as already being
extended by Sianne Ngai in work she's recently published in *Abacus* and
*Chain 4*.

'Described by one poet and critic on Saturday as "a thunderbolt from
the blue"' - ??? goodness, If I were this poet I certainly wouldn't want
people revealing that I'd used a phrase like "a thunderbolt from the
blue"!  Ted Hughes "Our greatest living writer"?  even if this refers only
to the island its impossibly wrong.  Isn't he about 30 yrs too late for
the "autobiographical sequence"?  Still catching up w/ his ex.  And that
racialized description of Plath - what the hell?!?  Oh, boy.   -m.

Subject:      Oy . . . Langpo

In the new *Philly Talks* Ron Silliman writes:

"*what is it about language writing and all that has come after it that there
has been no moment nor movement that has crystallized in anything like the
same way poetry did in the early 1970s?*  For all the anthologies of younger
writers, many of then extraordinarily gifted, what do we find in the way of
work that is actually new?  I think this must be the challenge that faces
every younger writer . . . "

 Perhaps it would help to answer this question if we asked what *exactly* was
new about Langpo.  It strikes me that you only have to glance quickly through
an anthology like *Poems for the Millenium* to realize that, formally, there
are many poems -- and hundreds of passages -- as radically innovative as
anything in Langpo.  In fact, as John Shoptaw notices, a poem like Frank
O'Hara's "What Appears to be Yours" from 1960 would not seem at all out of
place in *The Language Book* or *In the American Tree*.  By the mid-1950s --
as a reaction against the culture of Abstract Expressionism -- the New York
avant-garde of O'Hara's and Ashbery's generation had already moved away from
an aesthetic based on the physical body in relation to the poetic line.  If
Ashbery himself talks about the influence of say Pollock on *The Tennis
Coiurt Oath* this has really everything  to do with the enormous power of the
critical vocabulary with which theorists such as Clement Greenberg, Harold
Rosenberg and Meyer Shapiro articulated the project of Abstract Expressionism
-- that is, the difference between the art of Ashbery's generation and the
Abstract Expressionists was incapable of being described within the limits of
the language and concepts available for thought at this particular period.
 And it is this that seems to me to be the breakthrough of Langpo -- a
breakthrough that is more a matter of being able to *read* -- in an entirely
new way -- the more radical passages in the New American poetry than it is of
*writing* poems in a fundamentally new way.  (Here of course the reception to
post-structuralist theory   -- particularly the Marxist inflection it was
given by Althusser -- motivated the character of this reading.)   Nor does
Ashbery's influence end, as Mandel seems to suggest, with *The Tennis Court
Oath* -- I don't think it's mentioned in "The New Sentence,"  but isn't
"Three Poems" the crucial stimulus for the explosion of Language prose poems
written during the mid-, late- 70s?  Today I think there are formal
innovations being made that are as distinct from Langpo as Langpo's were from
the New American poetry.  The problem is that the critical language has grown
stale -- & like the radical work of the 1960s, there is no adequate
vocabulary with which to describe the implications of these innovations.

This seems to me a smart and succinct addition to what Josh Schuster began
the other day regarding generational differences, etc.  I wonder if some
of those poets on this list who consider themselves
related-to-but-clearly-post Langauge Writing might take a shot at adding a
few words of "adequate vocabulary" regarding "the implications of [their]
innovations."  That'd be fun to read; and it would make great use of this
List.  -m.

The trials & tribulations of trying to 'reply' to the list: I had a nice
long note thanking Tom Mandel for his postings 17-18 Jan (including his
nice mea culpa for his remarks on Greil Marcus). So I have to try again. I
appreciate his comments on the diverse bunch of people who have come to be
called Language Poets. I think I said something about the way his comments
on their choices of tradition(s) to follow & critique as well as those they
simply ignored made good sense, partly in terms of Constance Penley's
comments on an entirely different matter in her delightful & provocative
_NASA/TREK_: choosing to write as a fan because fans are most critical from
a position of desire.
Anyway, that bunch of posts was useful in the best sense. But then a lot of
the talk recently has been.

Mark Leahy: not sure which essay of Frank Davey's you mean, but you could
try either _Reading Canadian Reading_ (Turnstone 1988) or _Canadian
Literary Power- (NeWest 1994? [I dont have my copy beside me]), for some
essays that take on those questions. Frank, if he checks in on the list
might give you the exact essay title...?

Just got back from ice fishing in Wisconsin to find Don Byrd's reply
to my questions about community and the "Catskill School"--a group
that I have apparently more or less dreamed up in my mind over the
past several years. Thanks Don, though I sort of feel that I fell
through the list's thin ice with that post (with a bigger splash than
usual, that is), coming off pretty much like a secret Bloomsbury
wanna be, longing for the drawing room and patter about books
over tea.

Actually, I can trace this all back to the Sheraton lobby bar whare I
had  a drink or two with Jed Rasula at the MLA in Washington D.C.,
which was in '88 or thereabouts. As David Bromige has recently shown,
I don't have much of a memory, but I do know that after I told Jed I
wanted him in the Buddhist anthology even though he wasn't exactly a
Buddhist, I sat back and listened to Jed talk about his association
with you and Chuck Stein, and about other people in and around Bard
whose names I can't now remember, and the naive idea I got was,
indeed, of an "ideally literary" community, a real _comunitas_,
engaged in study and talk about some pretty heavy and weird stuff,
some of which I remember Jed going on about at some length with
frightening eloquence, bringing home to me that my best hope, really,
was to be a decidedly third or fourth tier personage in the pantheon
of postmodern poet-critics. And then I read Stein's anthology, and he
says something there about all the close associations and then, too,
the "Acknowledgments" page of _Poetics of the Common Knowledge_ does
too. So you see, I took that and stoked it wildly up, and here I've
been, all this time, imagining poets strolling by the Hudson, or
sitting around the fire two or threee times a week, earnestly talking
about Olson, Hegel, and high mathematics. Hoo boy...

Let me try to rephrase what my conjectural points were about this
community question, and here I suppose I'm going to sound completely
silly again, but so what, because as I recently said to someone b-c,
I teach at a community college and don't really have an academic
reputation to uphold. It's this: For poetic community, the presence
of _bodies in the flesh_, gathered together inside the sound of
voices, is key. And it's key because only with mutual human presence
can one witness and grow wiser from the falterings and awkwardnesses
and qualifications and sudden synchronicities of thought and insight
that are intrinsic to any movement toward understanding. I _agree_
with you that this doesn't mean that e-mail lists are not a good
thing! Far from it--obviously there's an incredible amount of
intelligence that arises here and the medium makes that possible. But
the medium also has its flip and "darker side" as I see it. And one
thing that I've come to feel is interesting about this list (and
correct me list-mates if I'm jsut projecting because maybe I am) is
that it is a place, in the first instance, of positioning and
_performance_, and one rarely finds a person and poet here openly
vulnerable in the sense of groping and stumbling _in the process of
thought_, certainly never totally at a loss for what to make of this
or that. Nor, consequently, does one often find others entering, and
sharing, and making use of, such falterings and false starts. To the
contrary: "Thinking" here tends to be sheathed in the finish of
performance (the best "finishes" being those that obscure
such status), in posts that are eloquent and quite sure of
themselves, quick to certainty and knife-edged irony, and quick to
draw the line of defense. Long posts and bitty short ones. Very
careful, everyone of us, and rarely a stutter to be heard. Even as I
try to type quickly here and make this be "not careful", I'm going
back and changing a whole bunch of stuff to make it sound better,
even more natural and spontaneous!

So the medium does that too, I think, amkes it fairly impossible
to enter into a relationship to thought and language that is not
thoroughly staged --and in that sense, it might be seen as
having a contradictory sort of relationship vis a vis the formation
of real poetic community that is enabling of the kinds of truly new
thinking and work that Ron Silliman laments the absence of, for
example, in his Philly Lectures.

***Oh Poets, get together in human form and talk with vulnerable
seriousness about difficult books, and reveal, proudly, that _most of
the time_, even if you're a big shot, that you don't know what the
fuck you're talking about, for this might lead us to places we could
never have suspected!!***

All of this stochastic in the extreme, but it's in that spirit that I
asked about Clarke, a really hard poet who makes me scratch my head
and sound like an idiot when I try to talk about him with my voice
box. To"talk" about him here would be a fantastic thing, of course,
and all sorts of new and breathtakingly eloquent insights would
emerge. But I suspect I might actually learn more _deeply_ about
Clarke by participating immediately (like at the diner, with plastic
ketchup and mustard bottles under the wall-juke) in the non-mediated,
non-edited struggle of others to understand and say, and then sharing
in, and being truly changed by, the moments of mutual clarity in
which all the false starts and silences inhere. Even if E.O. Wilson
is ultimately right that "what we call _meaning_" is nothing more
romantic than "the linkage among the neural networks created by the
spreading excitation that enlarges imagery and engages emotion," it
would be the case that the chaotic background patterns of
half-thought rivulets I have engendered iwth others will enter and
excite meaning and understanding, making it richer, more fractal, in
the human sense of the word. Yes, whatever that all means.

(Emma! More coffee!).

Alright, I suppose I've ruined myself now. I'm a _fifth_ tier sap
who needs to spend some time with Of Grammatology. I'm an
ice-fisherman who can't catch fish. I am a fool who just screamed
I LOVE SPEECH. But I will never forget my vivid, waking dream about
the beautful, light-encased men and women of the Catskill School of
Poetry.

Subject:      Langpods
Content-Type: text/plain

I read both of Safdie¹s recent posts with pleasure.  One of the many
thoughtful things he said to the Great Bromige was, ³I resisted then, as
I hope I would now, any so-called ³movement² that wanted to sweep away
what had gone before in its triumphal path; the tradition is important
to me.²  I have to admit, when I saw the Great one¹s slams on Tom Clark,
I wrote Safdie saying that I¹d like to get my Beowulf paws on that self
deluded, lying coward.  Something sweet like that.  But Safdie addressed
with intelligence the disease, while I fumed over the symptom.  I merely
want to stress Joe¹s remark, and ask, that guardian of banality Broomige
why he, like many others (and maybe you Œothers¹ could help him out
too), want to sweep the past away.  This repressed, psychotic inability
to acknowledge the mercantile reality of the art today is revealed too
often in the way poets like Tom Clark and Edward Dorn are tossed off by
the clergy of the precious librully minded langpod and langpod wannabes.
Hell.  Enough of these self-righteous and complacent Œcritiques,¹
Œexperiments,¹ and Œsyllogistic¹ amputations.  The imported theories
that fog your minds don¹t deserve the attention of some one like Tom.
But if they did call his attention, as some have, as Joe says, he is
more than able to Œunderstand.¹  He can even take these verbose and
hideous reformations and sniff out the lies, delusions and repressed
cravings that created them.  But that¹s not the point.  The point is two
of the most brilliant and dedicated men to engage the art of verse this
century are referred to only for an award for poetic idiocy that any of
us should have received instead of Steve Abbot.  Human beans, I dare
say, have allowed worse folly in their ranks.  Until now.  If that¹s the
only crime.  Because that¹s the only ever fully mentioned.  You, who can
name their atrocities, I¹m sure, live in a moral void that is sinister
in its delusion.



Since I¹m now on a holy high roll, please refrain from cursing my name
until I finish this paragraph.  Although that Bear Watten essay was, as
Joe points out, turgid, it did reveal something to me about the division
between material and non material texts.  Now, for the sake of
simplicity, I¹m gonna get binomial.  Stein represents one side, Pound
another, for us, active poets, in this dying century.  You langpods and
langpod wannabes adore Stein and the material text because all that
matters is the form.  You don¹t have to risk your necks on your
opinions, which is probably for the best, for obvious reasons.  Nor do
you have a single thing to say other than the most trite librul
platitudes.  So Œtexts¹ are arranged with splashes of polite humor.
(Something truly funny, by the way, sticks to you deeply, and would hurt
if time were allowed for reflection).  The arrogance of the material
text actually goes against your desire to be Œinclusive,¹ to let the
Œreader¹ read you because a reader (without quotes) is gonna laugh and
shut the book.  Hey, check it out.  I do all the time.  Take something
like Dark City to your mother.  Now what¹s she gonna make of that?  Or
are you so enlightened you know prior that she¹ll never understand?
Because, you see, unlike with Pound, you know that with a Steinian text
you¹re not going to receive anything for your efforts.  That would be
fine, in and of itself.  Art for art¹s sake.  But add some blind moral
obedience to these Œtexts¹ and then you get all sorts of high-minded
bullshit.   Plus, now, the material text is part of the orthodoxy of the
avant gard.  Dissent is silenced by the usual unquestioned platitudes
and reductions.  Lighten up.  There¹s a world out there.  Poetry¹s not
about right and wrong.  It¹s about what gets let into the poem and how
that is expressed.  The poem is worthy of everything available to the
poet, which includes the most frightening, disturbing and darkly
unspoken symptoms of a culture on the verge of moral bankruptcy.



I know what I¹m saying here will be received with disdain and ³horror²
but I must beseech you who condemn without reason and you who remain
silent about this condemnation to acknowledge the thoughtless, cruel and
truly disturbing state of poetry that exists today due to this langpod
attempt to silence the past, even silencing those from whom the art was
learned.  Disagreement and debate is one thing.  Reduction, character
assassination, smear campaigns and consignment to oblivion are truly
evil because nothing grows from this silence.  Somehow the poetic avant
gard (as opposed to the Random House of song) must confront its internal
tensions with courage and strength.  What separates this avant gard (I
use this term for lack of a more satisfactory one at hand) from the
Œmainstream¹ is twofold (at least on the surface):  formal challenge and
moral challenge.  At least the big pubs acknowledge, in their way, their
motivating force:  money.  IF that¹s not our goal, what is?  And if it¹s
not, then why model our practices on a corporate platform?  Well,
actually, it is about money, but not as much.  There¹s a lot of us after
a tiny piece of the pie, which is recognition, publication, teaching and
editing positions.  Is that the real issue?  I¹m not asking for
Œacceptance¹ of every opposing idea, but for vigorous debate over the
received ideas by which we function as artists in this culture.  Looking
for Œbalance,¹ or Œseeing the value¹ in opposed traditions is fine, but
if something¹s not believed in enough to put your neck out on the
chopping block, then what¹s the point of this relativism?  But this is a
waste of time.  I can already imagine the responses because I have
spoken to a group of people engaged with the orthodox issues of a
decadent late century art form whose practitioners are confused by their
own motivations for success and their desire to sublimate fear and
uncertainty through the medium of poetry.



Not to set myself above anyone.  I came to San Francisco enthused by the
works of Silliman et al, and I enrolled at New College to study with Lyn
H.  But in the process of that education I slowly came to realize how
utterly vapid, elite and alienating langpod poetry truly is.  But
obviously, others disagree and find much of value there.  But your
attempts to silence dissent are ridiculous and totally undermine the
methods practiced.  I, again, have written this to voice my dissent and
to let you know that such glib refutes as Bromige¹s are terribly
transparent.

Bob,

to your,

Tags is good.

But who is this 'you' perceiving in the past? I'd say the words had =

hand in it. This 'you' is a tool the words have made for their own ends,

an entirely different one. I think that's what helps make this so
difficult: we don't all think the same.

Not simple-minded. Was always clear.

Dale Smith:
"Because, you see, unlike with Pound, you know that with a Steinian text
you¹re not going to receive anything for your efforts."

Not to draw the battle lines to plainly, but this is total bullshit,
however rhetorically it may have been intended.  I don't have much at
stake here since I feel far to young to be caught up in what is obviously
a painful and historically determined tussle, and I certainly have nothing
against Dale, how could I?, not knowing him.  But, c'mon, let's be more
precise - there are enough intelligent, sincere, and kind people out there
who *have* gotten something out of Stein that we surely shouldn't piss on
her like that.  Can you not get anything out of, at least, *Three Lives* -
I did, in fact, recommend it to my mother, as well as my 17 yr old sister,
neither of whom are experimentally inclined in the least, and they both
loved it; I teach it to my students, few of them Einsteins, and they tend
to dig it; I also read "The Completed Portrait of Picasso to my
six-year-old twin nieces and they find it great fun, for the same reason
that I do - because language itself is a great pleasure, whatever it
happens to "mean."  You want everyone to read Pound because he rewards
exegesis?!  Well, hell, I like Pound well enough, but I don't have to tell
anyone that reading Pound and taking him at his word ain't without its
dangers.  Besides, why always the manichean approach?  Too much us and
then spoils the list.    -m.

Dale Smith, I wonder if, just once, you could talk about the virtues of, say,
Tom Clark's latest -- something I'd love to read about -- without positioning
yourself against the strawman/dead horse of Language poetry.  Rather than
being "shocking" your polemics strike me as somewhat shrill & naive -- more
like  projections of your own anxieties about "relativism," etc. than really
speaking to the complicated issues Langpo raises.

remembering.<<

Marcella, I've enjoyed Frances A. Yates' "The Art of Memory" for years.
Same deal, but in Classical Greece. I have even used the technique in a
writing class, asking the students to build such a palace, then to step
back through it and write what they found, with the one twist that on the
second time through they were to see their fantastic objects and creatures
as if for the first time. A sneaky way to get at symbolism, but it worked
marvellously. Matteo Ricci probably turned over in his grave.

Sorry, Matteo.

i think this and much else in Jacque's post raise some pretty good
questions / i'd like to pick up on the issue of "movements" though with a
question or concern on my mind: to respond to the beginning of the Silliman
quote that Jacques used to open, i wonder if the lack of "crystallization"
among young writers isn't due in part to the kind of movement-aversion
instilled by some of the LangPo rhetoric that seemed to voice a
disinclination to regard (or argue for) the goings-on of the early 70's as
a "Movement" per se / i think for a lot of writers for whom Language Poetry
offered a point of departure, the work and activities of these poets seemed
like a convergence of movements (some personal/individual, some collective)
from which other movements could arise / i think many of us have taken
quite literally the resistance with which many Language Poets greeted
statements that theirs was a Movement, at least in the early 20th c.
avant-garde sense born out of the moments of Surrealism, Dadaism, etc.

rejecting "anxiety of influence," i think a lot of younger writers avow a
*passion for confluence* / and don't consider as a chief concern embracing
a Movement platform that would require, realistically, marking distinctions
between new 90's and new 70's writing / there might be brief moments of
crystallization or freeze, perhaps when the power goes out and all the wood
in the world can't keep the chill out  / but there seems to me to be so
much movement these days, such strong currents, at various speeds and
depths, that the kind of freeze that might mark a Movement is just not
possible / the quick-fold rate of web sites, magazines, micropresses,
organizations, homes, affiliations, friendships -- also the kinds of
electronic and atomic flickering that keep things stirred up and
uncongealed on this discussion list -- index the movement i'm thinking
about: present and powerful but hardly localized, except in the individuals
whose sense of community often comes from fleeting moments of confluence in
time and space

i think that's why younger writers growing out of Language Poetry, Black
Mtn Poetry, Visual/Concrete Poetry, on back and out, are perhaps willing to
greet with a silent smile such labels as "post-language" and such
qualifications as "not new" -- because jelling/distinguishing/defining
(ourselves, the newness) are not priorities, having learned our lessons
well ("born again in the swarm, not separate and self-hypnotized, but
individual and related"--Miller) / the problem of distinguishing ourselves
as "the generation that refuses to distinguish itself" is perhaps something
to take seriously / certain efforts to avoid this paradox (in the diligent
essays of Mark Wallace, for example) might begin to address it / otherwise,
to me the new good work is roughage in a rough age, high-fiber poetry that
knows there's a lot still to be worked out / screw the new, anxious only to
see what's next...

this before breakfast and coffee

Sez Dale Smith:

1. Take something
like Dark City to your mother.  Now what9s she gonna make of that?  Or
are you so enlightened you know prior that she9ll never understand?<<<

2. Because, you see, unlike with Pound, you know that with a Steinian text
you9re not going to receive anything for your efforts.<<<

1. I had the pleasure of shopping in Bridge Street Books with my mother,
who is not versed (sorry) in the many different avant-garde/innovative/
querzblatz poetries that are out there. She picked up a book by Bernadette
Mayer, read in it, started to laugh, said, "This woman is crazy!" and then
bought the book. (Why does that figure of speech always involve the
mother? Are they dimmer about poetry than "your father"?)

2. Example of something I received for my efforts with Stein:

   "I am very miserable about sentences. I can cry about sentences but not
    about haircloth." (/How to Write/)

I love this. I mean, I really enjoy this in a way that requires no theory
to understand. I have received 44 freshman English diagnostic writings
today; I shall be very miserable about sentences indeed when I read them,
and miserable about sentences in a different way when I sit down and work
on my next titanic masterpiece. Haircloth, blah. But sentences--I relate.

Anecdotally,
Gwyn McVay

When did the underlying assumption of american poetry go from Frank
O'Hara's "I'm assuming everything is all right and difficult" to John
Cougar Mellencamp's "Nothing ever matters and what if it did"?

*

Are mandalas and cathedrals equivalent structures? I hear tell that both
are supposed to be formal structures that when meditated upon reveal the
image of heaven. Kent, Eliot, somebody jump in here.

*

Did nobody see Starship Troopers? What an amazing movie!

*

OK, so accepting that poets are _proforma_ liars and thieves, how do we as
a _union_ justify that behavior? That we have a higher order we're
following? And if we are as a class completely reprobate, do we have, um,
standards? Honor? As much as the non-participants want to say tut tut, let
us have no binaries here, think -- can poetry call attention to itself
_without_ some serious us and them action? It is much doubted. Or maybe
justification isn't what happens in those essays, articles, blurbs, etc.

in the last few years Im seeing a convergence of crossmedia
experimentation, computers realizing the promise of the early 60s & a
boundlessly exploding internationality of networking. mimetically our
mothertongues are being invited to morph into a larger confluence of
multi-dimensioned & interactive worldspeak.  while nationality of
language will always be a limitation, extra-language artforms like
visual poetry self-organize as intelligent biomes of sightsound
interactivity, & oftentimes the edges where radically differing styles
meet expose openings for the new work to follow. as dynamic codes I see
their effect most profoundly on someone such as my son, who lives amidst
a mini empire of such signs, his own expressions layered with these
sensibilities.  so in the physiological sense, the visual poetry meme is
the paradise garden we can choose to cultivate, it is the wilderness we
can be lost in...

Dale, am I correct in noting that you seem a little tense?

As someone who has moved slowly (both in reading and practice) from the
dominant "workshop" mode into a more experimental poetry, I find your
characterizations of language writing in general (as well as Bromige's piece
in particular) pretty unrecognizable.

As for _Dark City_ and my mother: well, unless you're gonna split hairs, _my
father and his wife_ (a mathematician and a "homemaker") went to a Bernstein
reading in DC last year and really dug it.  I believe my father got _Dark
City_ at the reading, or perhaps soon afterward.  He thinks CB is the bee's
knees.

Try to calm down.

Cheers,
David

Well to me, Jordan, Starship Troopers, as very much as mandalas or
cathedrals, may reveal the image of heaven.

Hi, Jordan.
        An interesting point. Mandalas seem to me like "magic eye" pictures,
except that they require trifocal vision [not necessarily an effect of
aging; '3rd eye'] in order to make them 'spiritually equivalent' to
_cathedrals_ [< L. sit + down, i.e., seat (of authority, of power)]: the
center that does hold. Also, despite their three- dimensionality,
cathedrals seem to me like texts/rites that require traversal via
'stationing' [e.g., of the cross], so one sees their story cumulatively,
whereas mandalas offer the kind of 'single image' for which Pound
exalted the Divine Comedy, or Blake's 'expanded moment.'

David,

I'll see what I can do about finding the manifesto of "Badism" (from the =
term coined by J. Lennon) and its followup essay "A Brief, Yet Helpful =
Guide to Bad Poetry"--I'm sure they're buried in a sock drawer somewhere, =
which makes them harder to retrieve than one might suspect, especially =
given my penchant for socks.

As I recall, at the time, I was trying to establish an aesthetics for bad =
poetry. While there seem to be so many opinions as to what makes a good =
poem, the criteria for a bad poem seemed much more universally-arrived-at-=
able.

I did for a time then set out to write bad poems, because I thought that =
if I could attain badness through intent, then I could also attain =
greatness through same (as soon as I figured out what greatness was in a =
poem). Unfortunately, my poems were not apparently bad enough. In fact, =
they were not unlike what passes for good poetry. My conclusion was that =
whether a poem was good or bad remained largely a matter of opinion (Lyn =
Hejinian recently confirmed this when she explained to me how she had =
discovered the simple truth that one argues for a poem because one likes =
it). David, you once said something that I think is applicable: "Being a =
poet is after all a matter of reputation. You're a poet because other =
poets say you are." And indeed I find that a poem is good, bad or etc. =
largely because we say so. =

I find it strange, for example, that Amy Lowell is still dismissed by =
folks who have read all of two poems by her (the unfortunate ones that =
keep cropping up in anthologies) largely due to Pound's dismissal of her. =
I trust Pound as a reader, but not as a personality, and I think Amy =
pushed him the wrong way. And (sheepishly) I admit that I like many of her =
poems and have preferred them to poems by Mina Loy (for example). Perhaps =
I like the poems because I like the idea of Amy, brash, butch and forceful.=
 And yet, in "Venus Transiens," the most delicate ear...

I'll go through my socks this week, if you like. =

My gratitude to one & all for a spirited, informative, interesting
wave of e-discussion, especially the Dylan and visual poetics strands.

*

I've been listening for the past few weeks to a new CD, Shadow
Resolve, by Jake Berry.  The latest installment--Book Two--of his
ongoing holy text BRAMBU DREZI is due out in a few months from
Pantograph Press.  If you don't know Jake's poetry, Book One of
BRAMBU DREZI appeared from Bob Grumman's Runaway Spoon Press (1993),
complete with all sorts of visuals--a kind of fusion of Klee/Miro and
a biology/chemistry textbook--in the service of a visionary project.

The CD, Shadow Resolve, strikes me as very much in keeping with
Dylan's lyrics of the Highway 61 / Blonde on Blonde era.  (Jake
claims other affinities as well:  Neil Young, Doc Watson, Hank
Williams, Robert Johnson...)  Jake's CD is the first on the Front
Porch Records label.  Recorded at his homw (9th Street Laboratories,
Florence, AL--where the Experioddicist e-zine arises as well), the CD
was mastered at FAME studios, Muscle Shoals, AL.  Basically, it's 10
tracks--great lyrics--Jake on vocals, harmonica, guitar.

If you're interested, order CDs at $12 (included postage/handling)
from Jake Berry, either e-mail or snail mail:

a snippet from track #2: From a String of Pearls

Mary undoes her perfumed hair
and dries the master's wounded feet
to hide the swans of Avalon
from the Penteteuch's retreat
In caves of the antlered dancer
where Broadway meets divine
I clipped your robes to save your soul
when you hated your own life

Cathedrals have it common with mandalas in as much as they are drawn up
according to some notion of sacred or symbolic geometry in order to
serve as meditational devices for focussing the outward as well as the
inward gaze.

Chartres is a good example: the Rose Window is a famous example of a
Western mandala. Less well known, perhaps, is the maze in the
cathedral's entrance, which mapped a symbolic route for the soul's
travels and by which one of the faithful could, in walking it a
sufficient number of times, enact the journey to Jerusalem which he or
she might not otherwise be able to afford. It may be useful too to think
of a cathedral as fully functional only when it was full of the
townsfolk for whom it was built. Amiens could, when it was first built,
accomodate all 10,000 of its people. The Super Bowl notwithstanding,
there's nothing comparable to that today.

for me the big reading turn-on was first genet, at 15, then somewhat later,
at 17 or 18, creely.  i'd been taking an "independent study" in creative
writing at my rigidly uptight girls' school, with the one teacher who when
she looked at my stuff didn't say something like, "oh i can see you never
had a real childhood," or some such thing that at the time felt insulting
and irrelevant.  so this teacher, who was willing to talk about *writing*,
had taken a summer course w/ creely or something. i didn't know that, but
somehow obviously the influence seeped over, cuz when i was on a bus going
up to visit a "boyfriend" in upstate new york i came across creely in an
anthology and had the most peculiar feeling, as if the words i was reading
on the page were in fact emanating from a point between my ribs, i.e. i was
somehow creating them simultaneously with reading them.  extraordinarily
gratifying, almost psychic, like "yr not alone, others are doing this too."
not that my writing was really much like creely's at all.  there was also,
i cringe to confess, bukowski. but that being the early 70s, it was
impossible to be a girl writing poetry without being sent to plath and
sexton, with dire predictive undercurrents about how it was all sure to
turn out.  i couldn't relate to those two at all, except that my mother
knew sexton and didn't much like her (felt intimidated by her flamboyant
sexuality).

re: mandalas set in self-paddled rotating canoes:

I just finished a poem.  It started out with something about
"New Year's" etc.  I noticed after finishing (finally) (after a weekend of
blessed solitude & demonic possession) it had 352 lines (in quatrains,
abba).  I go to bed (very late).  The next day, I realize I have left
something, an essential episode, out.  I finish it with 2 more quatrains
and a 5-line stanza, something about "the year ending".  The poem
now is a circle of 360 degrees (lines) plus five.  a year.  - Henry Gould

p.s. the title is "Ancient Light".  watch for the Spandrift CD version
from your local Wyoming outpost.

p.p.s. re: poetry wars. let me help you guys.  it's all about the
war between text & voice, letter & presence, person & ink.  70s poetry
(following the 60s) had a lot invested in "the natural".  Note how
Langpo claims to begin with the motto "I hate speech" (Grenier).  This
explains a lot.  By going back to text, Langpo had a lot of unclaimed
turf to exploit & mine for all it's worth.  Trouble is it's too easy,
gets kinda boring without an authentic performer there.  But often
equatable with all the too-easy unauthentic PERFORMERS they were against.

A lot of internet poets, collagists, visual poetrists, are excited now
about jazzing up the scene with multimedia collage.  Hey, go for it.
I get more out of japanese rock gardens.  stick with your metier.
Look at what Wallace Stevens, say, could do, just THINKING about
visual art.  That stream's still running. But I have to admit I've been
too busy with my own stuff to care too much about the next generations.

I like that Naples guy, Vico, the one behind Finnegans Wake.  He thought
writing came before speech, because early speech was a kind of gesture,
a simple sign language, hieroglyphics.  He equated visual art, poetry,
and speech - they're all in the same cabin.  I find that a happy thought.

But the difficult thing, oh... putting it into words that sing.
that's what poets do.  naked words, not lyrics, not scribbles, not
politico-aesthetico-academico-yammeryammer-crapola.  as Edwin Honig,
my old teach, used to illustrate again & again, it's an elusive
thing you can't predict, & it's hard to pull off.  poetry is rare.
or maybe I just like mine medium rare. - Henry Gould

Subject:      Langpods & the "Material Text"
Content-Type: text/plain

It¹s unfortunate that I referred to the Pound/Stein axis.  I merely
wanted to identify two opposing formal practices of many poets on this
list.  In all fairness to Stein, I should leave her out of my tirades.
Also, mentioning her name often obscures the more immediate issues I
want addressed.  Regardless.  I¹ve spent too much time with Stein to be
so reductive about her work.  Her books on Picasso, the Autobio and
Three Lives all stand out, with others, as subtle, charming and
innovative examinations and presentations of the diverse quality and
depth of life at the beginning of a new era.  More than anyone else she
tries, I think mimetically, to alter language to fit her perceptions of
a startling new world unlike anything in the past in terms of mechanical
and electrical stimulation.  I use her name though as being
representative of a pattern of language usage among certain poets this
century.  Although many today practice forms derived from Stein, very
few have the artistry, music or ambition to sustain that kind of close
examination of life that so intrigued Stein.  That kind of exactitude
and subtle humor is rarely exhibited in material texts today.  Clark
Coolidge is really one of the few poets today who can actually use the
material text to an advantage.  B. Meyer is another.  Others with a
sensitivity to music and to the exact nature and relation of their
perceptions to the mimetic possibilities of language are learning to
balance the formal complexities of the material text.  Where there are
signs of life there is art.  My gripe is with the degenerated practice
of the material text that so consumes poets today, the langpod and
langpod wannabes I have referred to.  The material text, for many,
serves as an excuse to sublimate not just conflicting, but confused,
half-hearted and duplicitous impulses based primarily on power, success
and the other predatory issues that consume society as a whole.  This
can be revealing, but it lacks an integrity and devotion to our
perceptive antennae.  When life is sucked out of language nothing is
left but this sublimated husk of an only personal desire.  The material
text at its best is responsive to, and receptive of, life.  Langpods
exclude life and fill Œtexts¹ with the random debris collected by an
arrogantly selective self that can not, or will not, acknowledge the
self¹s role, even in the most methodical and abstract instances.
Perhaps formal gestures such as the material text can and will
experience the same deprecations of value as iambic verse or heroic
couplets (Hi Chaucer!).  I think this is certainly the case today.

I want to thank Dale for returning to the poetics list, and I'm glad
he's picked up where he left off at the end of the summer. It's
difficult to excerpt from his writing but the following leaps out:

"My gripe is with the degenerated practice of the material text that
so consumes poets today, the langpod and langpod wannabes I have
referred to.  The material text, for many, serves as an excuse to
sublimate not just conflicting, but confused, half-hearted and

antennae.  When life is sucked out of language nothing is left but
this sublimated husk of an only personal desire.  The material text at
its best is responsive to, and receptive of, life.  Langpods exclude
life and fill ‘texts1 with the random debris collected by an
arrogantly selective self that can not, or will not, acknowledge the
self1s role, even in the most methodical and abstract instances."

First off, I want to apologize for the apparent typos, but I am
assuming that there is a formatting error in the way my email software
receives Dale's messages (does anybody else experience this?). Second,
Dale makes a number of very interesting points, which suffer
unfortunately from the very evacuation of specificity that I think he
might be referring to (note how much his post embodies what he calls
"When life is sucked out of language nothing is left but this
sublimated husk of an only personal desire"!). I think the
conversation might be advanced by the extension of the argument into
more developed and sustained critique, rather than bland and vague
attacks. It isn't worth really looking into the details of what he's
saying here (although I find it very very interesting this quote
above) but I have no idea who or what he's talking about. With some
engaged discussion of actual texts (people?) this might be some fun.
So, how about it, Dale? Welcome back.

Kent, that was a great & useful post -- Wow -- do I dare wade in on this
ice fishing scene. cld get wet or frozen feet. but, doggone, here I am
up way past my bedtime listening to Visions of Johanna and remembering
all of those specific epiphanic moments, but that will have to wait for
another post — what I wanted to say was, no Kent,  you didn't really
dream up that "Catskill school" community, its just that ole friend Don,
as good hill people will be, is ever ready to keep them furrinners at
bay  & won't let you in on the secret community, unless of course you
show up with a bottle of Maker's Mark (hey Don, if he does, call me) —
if you go out through the back door of that lousy diner he and Chuck
have here meetings at (there's a much better one in Redhook, where I
used to... but that's another story too) you come out in Lyonesse and a
whole range of magico-poetico esoteric landscapes never dreamed of.

    Look -- I moved back to the mid-Hudson valley several times and from
several continents because I have felt since the late sixties when I
first lived here that there was some magick here. And especially poetry.
The present stretch is from south of Kingston, where the likes of David
Levi- Strauss and Carolee Schneeman nest among the plasticians, as they
call visual artists in France, up & through Kingston (with Lydia Davis &
Pauline Oliveros) and on to Barrytown & Annandale, i.e. Quasha, Stein,
Kelly, Higgins  territory, then  up through Hudson — Ashbery land — to
Albany, Byrd-man-land. And West is Woodstock with Ed Sanders on poetry &
various instruments & Marilyn Crispell on piano, & East is the Bershires
with Paul Metcalf, plus a medley of poetas, Coolidge, Gizzi etc. (though
these last ones are conscious that they live in Mass & kind alook down
on us lowland new york catskill hicks).

    Now, we don't all get together all the time for jamming on Hegel,
but have over the years done so in various visible and invisible
formations. (last time I remember doing that was a long time ago when
Jed was out here & I had come in from London — wondering if I should
join Quasha's Rhinebeck ventures in publishing & restauration or go off
to teach & travel in Algeria). But the place is full of such energy
nodes -- from late sixties first Bard undergraduate days with Norman
Weinstein, Bruce McClelland and Thomas Meyer, to that whole incredible
list of interesting & amazing poets who've come out of or through  Bard
— just think of Juliana Spahr, Tim Davis, Kimberley Lyons, David Gansz,
Drew Gardner, to name but the first names that come to mind.  And
obviously Robert Kelly, who has been there, central, peripheral,
visible, invisible, but a major source of energy for over 30 years now.
    I may have spent most of my post-teenage years living in Paris,
London and New York, but the strongest sense of  community — poets' &
artists' but also just plain human — even if and maybe exactly because
often "unavowable" communities — & the strongest actual experiences of
exchange in ideas & inspiration & energy happened here during the thirty
years I have known the place. And that's not over — it's ongoing even if
often the community is, as Don wld say, more virtual than real. &
doggone, this here house is often full with live bodies, eating,
drinking talking that poetry talk (& other talk as well) and reading.
You're welcome, next time you drive through. & I got to sack out so
can't reread and edit this thing down to good email protocol, so here
goes as is,

Pierre

Hi everyone, it's Kevin Killian.  I was reading the "Chronicle" this
morning here in San Francisco and saw the big write up of the Stanford
conference on Bob Dylan.  Congratulations to Aldon Nielsen, "literature and
writing chair at Loyola Marymount University," and a member of this list.
Nielsen "offered one of the day's few mischievous views of Dylan's
ascension into pop culture legend.  Nielsen hopscotched deftly from the
Supremes and the "Blues Brothers" movie to playwright Brendan Behan,
critic-philosopher Jacques Derrida and Dylan's own impressionistic novel,
"Tarantula," suggesting that Dylan's appropriations of black American
culture have been less than pure."  Congratulations also on following up
Saturday's talk with your reading on Sunday at Canessa Park, which I did
attend, a reading pelted with rain but you and Shauna Hannibal were both
quite good.  Sexy too.  And I'm glad I went.  Good on ya Aldon!

Having over my years as a list-member watched Ron Silliman repeatedly--and
I think with good intentions--try to insult a new generation into
existence, I feel more bemused than offended to see him at it again in the
passage excerpted by Jacques Debrot from the new *Philly Talks* (which I've
not yet received):

>"*what is it about language writing and all that has come after it that there
>has been no moment nor movement that has crystallized in anything like the
>same way poetry did in the early 1970s?*  For all the anthologies of younger
>writers, many of then extraordinarily gifted, what do we find in the way of
>work that is actually new?  I think this must be the challenge that faces
>every younger writer . . . "

While I would confidently put the first books, chapbooks, and editing
projects of Lisa Jarnot, Lee Ann Brown, Bill Luoma, Jennifer Moxley, Kevin
Davies, Rod Smith, Chris Stroffolino, Peter Gizzi, Juliana Spahr, and many
other "young" writers up against any work done at a comparable age by any
language poet, I do think that one material condition has greatly
distinguished the task of emergence after 1989 from the one faced by Ron's
generation in the mid-1970s: the comparative lack of state and federal arts
funding for avant-garde writing and publishing projects.

How many of the exceptional magazines and books of 70s language-centered
writing would have been brought into existence *without* California arts
funding and the NEA?  Kit Robinson's excellent *Streets & Roads* folded
after one issue for lack of it; *Hills*, *This*, *The Figures*, *Tuumba*,
all managed to receive some very significant support, as did Burning Deck
and scores of other hospitable small houses on both coasts and throughout
the country.  As an experiment, try taking every book by Silliman that
received NEA support off your poetry shelf and tell me how much of the
alphabet remains.  Now do it for all the other usual suspects.  See?

I am familiar to the point of nausea with critiques of the NEA, but I think
the money it infused--mostly to publishers rather than individual poets,
who certainly were often discriminated against for their radical aesthetic
commitments--goes a long way toward explaining the difference Ron
mistakenly assigns to the novelty-deficient young.

I might also say that the situation is past critical now and shows every
sign of declining more, the evangelism of the e-mediasts aside.  Jarnot's
*Some Other Kind of Mission* was a first book published in the year its
publisher, Burning Deck, had its NEA money more or less totally eliminated.
Multiply that story fold upon fold and you get something of the picture.
The ability to get the new(s) out depends on slimmer and slimmer margins,
as the shots get longer and longer.  The lack of dynamic new venues for the
sustained presentation of work--magazines of course, but more importantly
publishing houses--troubles me the most.  Hello era of the chapbook with
zero circulation, ask England how they've liked it.  But against such a
backdrop, to impugn the accomplishment of young writers is grossly
misplaced.  Viewed as they must be in relation to real material conditions,
their accomplishment is in many ways ethically as well as aesthetically
grander than that of their counterparts who now are the president's age.

Time to sing a new song, Ron.

Cathedrals are very imposing structures. Take the Freiburg cathedral. The
nave is all gold and glitter inside, for that is the focus of power.
Outside, the sandstone is encrusted with gargoyles, this world of demons
trying to get in. Compare that to the tiny village churches of northern
France, north of Charlesville or Sedan, to which the houses of the village
cling, like limpets to a rock.

In Freiburg, again, the side doors are each guarded by an angel, with a
sword, providing safe passage. Inside is stillness, a forest of stone,
rising to imposing height, designed to make one incredibly small, and it
works well at that. It is also a crypt. My take on it is that it has
captured space, held it inviolate from the corrupt world, and purified it
over centuries, carrying it to paradise, when *all* of time (and similarly
life and death) shall be dismissed, as it is in the cathedral.

The Marienkirche in Constance has, in the centre of the ceiling, a small
oval of plaster, on which is painted the eye of God, in a blue sky with
fluffy white clouds. He's watching, always. We take our place, on the floor
of his creation. His sky is situated, not as an over-arching blue dome, but
in the midst of a grander scheme, lines of tension, so to speak, flying
buttresses, which are manifested or given worldy shape as the cathedral.

In the Grossmuenster in Zurich, the doors are cast out of iron. Each door
is divided into squares, and each square depicts a story from the Bible.
One door is the Old Testament, one the New. They are incredibly heavy, yet
can be opened with a light touch of the hand. By passing through their
gateway one enters the interior of the Word.

I second Joel Kutzai's response to Dale Smith's latest : attach these
general aspersions to some particular texts. Elsewise it's all a blather of

I agree with Steve Evans that a new generation (including those he names)
are writing terrific poetry, and I agree that the absence of arts funding
is one big change since the 70s. I am not quite sure how this prevents a
more general formulation among corresponding poets, of common ground or
common goals--which I _think_ was part of Ron Silliman's question.

In any case, I want to remind Steve and the others of my post from nearly a
year ago, suggesting ways to raise money for reading series and
publications. I said, and repeat now, that I learned this in the course of
working with an ad hoc group of environmentalists here in Sonoma County :
we needed to hire an attorney, and she needed $16 grand. We held two
weekend-long flea-markets in a parking lot that goes with an office
building where one of our number has his business. We raised $4 grand each
time. We held a "social" at the community center, asking musicians and
other entertainers to donate their services, and we made a net profit of
$3500.

The rest of the money we came up from our own donations and those of people
we solicited.

Sure, it takes time--planning sessions, rounding up junk to turn into
antiques,finding big enough pieces of plywood to serve as tables, and the
sawhorses to support them, manning the tables. . . But it beats sitting on
one's duff bemoaning the cruel fate (and cruel it is!) that got one born
too late for an NEA. It creates or enhances a sense of community, what's
more. There could be yard sales for poetry throughout america.

Listfellows, that bit about "sitting on one's duff," etc, was definitely
_not_ aimed at Steve Evans, despite juxtapositioning can make it seem so.
Few have done as much as he, to circulate and devise necessary info in
these times that would make an endeavor such as his, impossible.

I think the hint of irascibility is due to the following : it was almost a
year since I first posted this suggestion, and to date i have not heard of
one poetry community that has essayed this solution. I don't think my
irritation is altogether due to "how could they overlook a suggestion
coming from _me_ !?" It's just so plain to me (since I have been among
those successful at it) that there's a way partially to remedy the
attrition in funding for oppositional groups; given that, at the same time,
it was never going to be easy. Me, I'd sooner get together with 15 other
like-minded souls for a weekend of junk-recycling and amiable haggling,
than fill out a grant application. But hey it's your generation, I'm sure
your time to you is worth saving.    David

I'm not England, but i live here and am one among several who's work is
considered almost invisible from the 1980s-90s, by newer generations of
poets eager to read their immediates  -  let alone anything much else
(until more recently). The funding dearth in England was politically
imposed, but happened to coincide with a period of time when attitudes
towards ephemerality and orality were playing themselves out most
rigorously. By that i mean, performances were often obscure sites of
extremely interesting work imho. Book production did explore the
dematerialization of its object status here. This was also a time when
performance poets of many persuasions were also forging alliances with
practitioners from other art forms and so at least partialliy shifting the
boundary of their practice away from conspicuous consumption by literary
readers. What i mean by that is that good work happened in movement-based
or sound-based or live art-based (and so on) contexts rather than in
bookshops or at poetry reading series.

What little was published, and Steve's bleak assessment is accurate, was
mostly by auteurs using photocopying. Poets doing the typesetting,
printing, collating and stapling themselves. A press such as Meow would be
an upmarket model (i love Meow books btw). Some 'books' were circulated in
editions of 30 or 50 copies only. Many did not have ISBN numbers and were
either not placed with or even in some instances willfully misheld from
placement in the 'public' collections (such as the POetry Library and the
British Library et al).

Things are considerably improving but it's a long slow mend. There were
those (such as Reality Studios, Reality Street, Spanner, Writers Forum,
Equipage, Pig Press, North and South and others) who kept the flame going
or who spurred the gathering resurgence. Advancing regional dispersion has
helped 'us' funding wise as has perhaps most significantly developments in
production and reproduction technology. With 'products' once again looking
sellable, distribution opportunities are opening up.

That's part of our story from this point of view. Be careful. From my
limited travelling in the US i'd say the market needs a push, not a wither.
It's time to become extremely resourceful. If the conventional pathways are
shrivelling then take note of ways in which other groups fund their
campaigns. David Bromige has good points.

love and love

Dead-on, I'm afraid.  My public-school English teachers put on paper hats
once a year and merged their classes to act out Godot; screened Bunuel, The
Seventh Seal and Last Year at Marienbad in any class that would reasonably
apply; and seemed confused by the notion that the Plath/Sexton trajectory
wouldn't interest a girl.  For Love came into my hands somewhere around
there, I remember, but my antidote was Gary Snyder.  Bless them, though, for
Nathaniel West.

Just want you to know, David, I took your yardsale idea seriously.
Passed around your message at meeting.  People were skeptical ("$4,000.
from a yard sale?  Must be Beverly Hills..." etc.) but the idea is
good & the same energy could be applied to a variety of fundraising
methods.  Grassroots fundraising to build poetry audiences - I like
the sound of it...  Steve was right to call Ron on his statement, but
do we want to go back to NEA grantsmanship & the dual system of
commercial publishing and gov't funding?  Poetry has a very weird
relationship to the mechanism of mass marketing, fiction publishing,
and the general reader; you could get all the funding you needed,
all the books out there you wanted, all the p.r. & press coverage -
and would you have any interesting poetry?

I realize this sounds very complacent in the face of a depressing
publishing situation.  But my point is that the issue between
generations hinges more on a "theoretical" self-understanding or
self-presentation of a mode of poetry (which maybe is what Ron was
getting at) than on differing "material conditions".  The poetry
groupings of the past that we're all interested in assumed that
poetry is ONE THING, and it's a battle for hegemony - thus no matter
where they were on the publicity canvas, their position was
"political" (in an artistic sense) and their voices mattered.
The issue is not, can the "younger generation" break out of its
obscurity via a more supportive publishing environment; the issue
is, can they distinguish themselves from the aesthetic-cultural
niche ESTABLISHED for them by the Ron-Clinton-etc. generation.
Established for them - but still run & controlled & thinned out
by the tenured oldsters - all those "teachin' experimentalists",
all those grayheads at Brown, SUNY, Naropa, SF, San Diego, the
Poetry Project, or whatever mafias you want to check out. That's
what attracts people to the Russians - they're good at chess, mafias,
and theory.  And now & then you find, hey, there's a few poems
there.  a few. Written by talents nurtured in childhood outside
of ANY literary politics.

tardily, i'll suggest (again) a look at:

    www.burningpress.org/va/vaintro.html

representing but one of a number of momement/movements that have, if not
crystallized, at least been strong confluxes of poetic/community energies...
one significant difference, as i've suggested before, is th lack of critical/
theoretic attentions either frm within or outside...  ov course, such
attentions/components are sometimes held as markers of "seriousness"
(as if, lacking overt critical discourse, there is no critcal thought or
theoretic underpinning)--certainly that's an impetus to my part in the
project...  but, to th extent that these poetries are oppositional, praps
part of the opposition is aimed at that kind of performative proof-of-value?

i am glad steve evans brought material history to bear on the history of
the "material text."  without wanting to engage the langpo vs postlangpo
thread, i must say that many discussions of the langpos' "complicity" with
the academy and other institutions they seek to undermine in praxis
overlook the fact that this turn to the academy has much to do with the
erosion, starting under reagan, of not only money for the arts, but any
kind of "alternative" and useful employment opportunities that existed
during the days of economic expansion and funding for social programs.

Larry Fagin didn't fudge once or twice in applying the n + 7 algorithm to
the inaugural poem to create "On the Pumice of Morons."

When I've read some of these artists on the subject of their work, it
seems to me that they're very conscious of making aesthetic (better word?)
choices, even in creating a work that includes aleatory processes. To

    There is so much going on here that I can't keep up.  I will try to get in
on thethe meatier issues of the new (though classes are starting at the
University this week) and say a few words about Pierre's expose later.

    I only want to make one quick observation here.  The poetry scene of the
60s and early 70s that Ron and I came into and which we both would like to see
reappear, because it was an almost unbearably exciting time for every one,
young and old, was created without the NEA. (Incidentally, take a look at Elsa
Dorfman's web site.  She has a photograph of Duncan, Irby, and Waldman which
seems to me to capture a lot of that time in a single image--three generations
as it were. For some reason, I can seem to connect with it right now, to get
the URL, but it will turn up in a search).

    The NEA brought us perfect binding for little magazines and small press
books.  This was nice: book stores like perfect binding because the books fit
on the shelves.  Huge numbers of books were produced.  Jed and I cashed to
produce a few issues of Wch Way (most of which are still in my basement by the
way, if any one wants a genuine piece of literary history).  But the NEA did
nothing to solve the distribution problem. That, however, was just bad
administration: if they would have given money to libraries to buy small press
and little magazine material, instead of giving it directly to publishers to
publish that problem could have been in part solved.

    The deeper problem, however, is that it created an industry, producing
products that for the most part no one wanted to buy. People started tailoring
their work to the NEA, not to the issues of the necessities of their work.  It
seems to me frankly that a great deal of the weariness in the poetry scene can
be traced directly to the NEA.  You cannot expect a government to fund
revolutionary art.

    While I am on this track, incidentally, I should also say that you cannot
expect universities as institutions of the state or, worse, of private wealth,
to support revolutionary art.  The same thing is happening in universities that
happened with the NEA. The Humanities were offered to the New Left of 60s as a
kind of preserve. I don't think there was an active conspiracy, but it is as if
some time during the Carter or Reagan administration, someone said, "What are
we going to do with all damned the Marxists and poets?"  "Give'm the English
department."

    Now they are pulling the plug on English departments as they did on the
NEA.  Since 1991, the faculty of the department here has been reduced from 43
to 27 full-time faculty members, and the slack has been taken up by adjuncts,
many of them poets.

    Granted, born in 1944, I am not quite a baby-boomer.  I have gone through
demographic doors that have slammed closed behind me.  I have a cushy job,
tenure, a Professorship. I have no more hurdles to jump.    It must be
remembered that jobs for poets in English departments in any number is also a
new development. Even when I was tenured, a book of poetry was not held against
you, but, you had to have produced a "serious" book as well.

    Let me make one more quick hit, and get down to the business of the day.
The problem of publication is solved.  For considerably less than the price of
one  80-page perfect-bound book, it is possible to produce a cd-rom.  A cd-rom
will hold about 560 megabytes.  You could almost squeeze the entire contents of
the Encyclopedia Birittanica on one of them.  We could publish an annual that
would include every scrap of text that every one on this list writes, leaving
space for much of the multimedia work, if the multimedia people would compress
the files to the size they have to be for web sites.

        Who's to say? I have no trouble understanding why it would take 25
years of writing for him to come to turns with Plath's tragedy. It
probably has taken many people who were not even particularly close to
Plath at least as much time.

        Nor do I have a problem with anyone wanting to keep private about
their emotions or to think about the impact on their children. Perhaps if
he had come out with an "autobiographical sequence"  immediately after
Plath's death, you would be accusing him of opportunism, false emotion
(and everything else under the sun). Personally, I would be more inclined
to trust the emotions of a sequence of poems such as this if it comes out
later, after some soul-searching.

        I wouldn't call him "our greatest poet", not by a longshot. Nor
would I call Andrew Motion the greatest of critics given these comments (
though I still look forward to reading his book on Keats). The poem Rachel
quoted stinks (*vomiting noises*)-- it is easy to agree on that. I'd like
to see the whole collection before judging, though. Some of the other
poems, printed Monday in NYT, struck me as much better, more real, and
genuinely grieving, and it might be that they are more representative.

I stand corrected.  Have never met a living Langpote (only paper and
digital ones, and they've been pretty nice to me...Maybe I'm not a fool
after all!!)

I wasn't where it was at, to see those public corrections.  But in a sense
I stand by what I said (or thought I was saying): whether personally
tolerant or not, the Language circle(s) have never held a single set of
beliefs and goals.  But much of the feeble flak fired at 'em seems to
imply a uniformity I don't believe I see there.  You were right to pick up
on my word, "vague"..I expressed myself badly, and meant that in many
cases they were rather "vaguely connected" with each others' goals and
projects, not that they were mild absent-minded perfessers.

Subject:      Uh...New?
Content-Type: text/plain

Although I'm glad the NEA funds have dried up I want to second Steve
Evans' comments re: younger writers.  Lisa Jarnot, Hoa Nguyen, Connie
Deanovich, Kevin Opstedal and others are actively engaged with poetry,
producing provacative and exacting forms of verse.  Two invocational
poems published
recently in Mike and Dale's by Jarnot stand out to me as intelligent and
deeply felt examples of poetry that conveys the freshness and novelty of
the 'material text' while permitting a personal voice to carry through
the poem in a sustained  projection of immediacy and power.  Jarnot
reveals an experience of urban life with subtle humor and music. Her
form isn't new, but the content lives.  You see, 'New' does not mean
innovative forms only.  There are no new forms.  There are existing
forms used by poets to different ends.  This measurement in terms of
Newness is limited and limiting.  It's arbitrary and used to increase
distances between generation of poets.  If it were up to the Silliman,
Langpods would be known as the only folks to ever practice poetry, every
one else, before and after, falling short of his ideal demands of the
new, whatever those may be.

More specific examples for Joel and Bromige later today.  Stay tuned, by
Gar.

What is it about missing "e"'s? Here's an open confession to show
that Maria is not alone--To this day I have to look up the poet's

Embarrassing, but what the heck, I _love_ to confess myself on this

A lovely evocation, Harold - thank you. I think you've hit the

 My take on it is that it has

it

ago, and I'm delighted to be goaded into at least a brief response.  It is
a fine book.  (I may yet run a review of it..Maybe I should get Crag to
write it!) A great range, wit, energy.  A poet to be encouraged.

Also to be encouraged: spontaneous generous appraisals on the List, like
this one by Crag.  I see the affinity to Ceravolo, a real favorite of mine
(transrational musicality as a form of intuition?)...But wouldn't'a
thought of it myself...

A Hughes stanza from the new book actually made the CNN news last evening,
with the newswoman reciting -- over displayed text -- a section of a poem
recounting Ted & Sylvia's wedding day.  I'll bet that was a CNN first. The
passage sounded like pretty bland, standard fare to me, and I didn't buy
the image of Sylvia standing there "brimming with God" at all. I think
Hughes is much more comfortable when he writes about nasty animals eating
other nasty animals. - Fred M.

I think Robert Drake makes a good point. For the most part the older,
established "Langpo"s have teaching positions and groups of students or
former students who follow and imitate their work. Additionally, these
younger writers have swallowed in part their tradition and aesthetic to
the point of myopia. As someone who went through a different tradition
as a MFA student at Columbia, and fought for my personal aesthetics
without this support system, I find comments about postlangpo or lack
thereof a little inbred. I'm a younger writer who is "influenced" by
langpo, but I never studied with one in an institution. "New" writing is
happening now, just not necessarily under the umbrella of "established"
langpos or their university affiliations.

Marvelous description of a utopian poetic community, Kent - though not
quite so utopian as one might imagine. I enjoy something like it, albeit
on a smaller, humbler scale, here in Boulder, among the well-entrenched
poets of Naropa, CU and Denver. Jack Collom, myself, Lindsay Hill and
Michael Friedman get together at each other's houses once a month to
read our own and others' work and to discuss the stuff at hand at some
length. Hegel never comes up, I confess, but it has been very
instructive and stimulating for all of us. Community must be grounded in
the physical, finally, I think. That's part of the problem with this
list - one of the reasons, as I've opined to others in the past, why
people get so easily bent out of shape and say things here they'd never
say to a person's face. Well, most of us anyway. I'd never get rich
betting on the limits of your cheeky chutzpah - you really know how to
throw a gauntlet with style and that's something I say. (Dale Smith,
please take note! And btw it is good to see you back.. even though I
could not agree less with your stand re: Langpo).

I accidentaly deleted Rachel Loden's post that quoted the poem with
"racist" imagery, but I wanted to ask if perhaps _in context_ of the
whole work it might be read differently? That is, the poem is about
Hughes remembering Plath over 30 years ago. Might the bizarre
references to physical type be a frank and self-conscious recalling
of his own racism, a way of evoking an emotional darkness that
presages what is to come? It does have a very 1960's ring. Eliot, for
example, is still around at the time of this "picturing" of Plath.

I have no idea, but just wondering if Hughes might be up to something
more here which the whole book might make clear. But maybe not, and
that would really be something!

footnote to Susan's note on _Don't Look Back_ -- the film occupies an
innerstin' spot in film history, not just as progenitor of much subsequent
success & excess in the concert documentary genre -- several of the people
involved in the Dylan project had earlier worked on the film that follows
President Kennedy around during the Alabama intergration crisis

dale, beg your pardon, and not to pick on you, but---

i've grown about as weary of defending the "new" as a yet viable category
of---is it analysis? or (pro)creation?---as i've grown weary of hearing a
specific past erected as an arbiter of same...

which is to say, what we're doing now, *here*, is new, yes... if "new"
means, can mean something akin to "what 'we' did not/could not do a decade
ago"... *and* if one is capable of sensitizing oneself to the difference(s)
twixt a letter column, in print, and a string of ascii characters (e.g.,
and with due regard for problems with ascii)... *and* if one is willing...

nothing wrong, necessarily, with the old either... but just b/c some of my
(beloved---i am not being ironic) friends from the 60s seem dedicated to
naysaying the "newness" of what has arrived since does not mean we should
refuse to deploy said term, or to dispense with it entirely... *esp.* not
when the very medium in which such discussions are permitted is, uh, new...
"life goes on/long after the thrill/of living is gone"?---ok, but the
thrill is just not gone for me...

oh & check that:  for "deploy" insert "deplay"...

now:  i guess i'm 'picking on' ron s. and don b. as much as on dale!... i'm
trying to do so in a friendly way, really---to gloss kent j., w/o a whole
lot of refinement... please try to imagine my distressed look at the moment
as i work up this para to assuage any residual irritation that comes
seeping through the pixels... but steve e. makes a lot of sense to me...

ok:  as i've just posted someone backchannel, and to riff on _easy rider_,
"we blew it"... but thank the lord we're not stuck back in 69, as any
person of color or feminist or gay (and please don't tell me these are not
useful distinctions) will be sure to intuit... in some sense we've come a
long way, baby... in others, we've still a long fucking way to go...

as to aesthetic/poetic mimicry:  i just don't get laying this at the
doorsteps of the langpo 'movement'... i see much more of same in the
hallmark universe of discourse... at the same time, if langpo seems
powerful to you non-academics out there, perhaps you ought to consider how
much power is behind an avg. annual salary (all profs, all disciplines, all
universities) of just over $50K (which i and many like me, moving into our
40s, are still a long way off of)... i raise this monetary issue b/c i
sense a lurking tangent re who speaks---as in the vizpo thread, where it
was clear to me that marjorie perloff (ok yeah sure a friend) is doing her
best to shake up a rather staid stanford institutional setting... do any of
you folks think the ivory tower is really an ivory tower?---if so you
haven't gotten your hands dirty with academic politics... every course is
an act of exclusion---i hope nobody judges my course by some strict (new
critical?) measure of my syllabus, lordsakes... if in class you encourage
your students to read around in print and get online and explore, class
discussion will always diverge from stated loci, and open to, uhm, new
directions... do you really believe marjorie is *not* doing this?...

there are just so many issues here, i think it'd be nice if we'd try to
disentangle a few... and hey, while i'm at it:  why the casual diss of c &
w music (e.g., vis-a-vis dylan)?... i can see [cough] ideological problems
with *all* popular music... what of it?...

i've posted this before:

http://www.iit.edu/~amato/moonlight.html

it's a draft (is this public aspect of a conference "process" new?---nobody
asked me to post this draft)... i think i use the word "new" once in the
piece, a piece directed of course to folks who know little of the vital
work so many of you on this list are actively engaged in... please advise
if acceptable, or if just a gimmick... one thing is certain:  nothing is
stopping me from linking to mandel, brathwaite, giscombe, hunt, barbour,
levy, miekal and, perloff etc etc etc... not yet anyway...

all of that said:  the discussion hereabouts has picked up some of late, in
what seem to me---unnecessary provocations aside---some intriguing ways...
but (if i may) let's not mistake animosity for animation---you can have the
latter w/o the former, you bet, though we moths tend to be drawn into the
flames [flap flap}...

best,

joe

thanks Kevin -- and great to have seen you again

haven't seen the CHRON -- but want listophiliacs to know that the words
"less than pure" never passed my lips!   and just what would a "pure"
appropriation of black American culture be????? and more importantly, why
would it be?

the pure appropriations of American go hazy --

but, it's about what I'd expect -- I joked with somebody at the conference
(after Christopher Ricks's paper) that if somebody were to say "Dylan's
poetry pales next to that of Coleridge," the next day's paper would say
"critic compares Dylan to Coleridge!"

but, will have to get me a copy of that rare notice --

(now about that Ted Hughes and those "African lips" . . .)

I was struck by the poems in NYT-- the poems seemed like diaries almost,
present tense, personal, confessional, etc. Very different from the mythic
voice that Hughes usually aims for. Bland, yes. It's not his usual thing,
but then this seems to be the first time he has published strictly
autobiographical material. Since it is 25 years worth of revisiting the
same subject, it will be interesting to see if this changes or if writing
about very personal things is something he can do well at all.

Or about the natural world in general. Yes, those are much better poems.
Hmmmm... he and Plath both seem to have a flare for really aggressive
subject matter.

> Also to be encouraged: spontaneous generous appraisals on the List

George Albon--possibly San Francisco's best-kept secret, two chaps, Possible
Floor (e.g.) and King (Meow). His more "significant," larger-scale writings
include Cosmophagy and Empire Life (two titles I remember), as well as a
collection of shorter poems, We'll Build Here. Work upcoming in Avec Sampler
(hopefully lots); also in the last Gertrude Stein Award, issues of lyric&,
Antonym, Mirage and Cyanosis. Wide range of reading, but primary generative
influences seeming to be Celan, Niedecker & Oppen. His work somewhat similar,
but more colorful, lushly populated. Does extraordinary things with rhythm--one
piece written as kind of overlay to Ives piece. Catullus versions as good as
anyone's. A few things on the web:

http://www.system-zero.com/cyanosis/Image/digitum/albon/thecurrent1.html

http://hardpress.com/hewhp/lingo/authors/albon.html

Laurie Price--first book, Except for Memory (Pantograph), hands down the best
full-length collection by a contemporary I've read. How describe what her
writing does? Some influences: Stein, Laura Riding Jackson, Niedecker,
Berrigan, Notley. Thankfully resembles none of these, nor a melange (to me).
Often ethereal stuff, & feels oddly not situated this century (rare in avant &
mainstream alike). Genuinely baffling. Other projects include a glass book
(extraordinary--Steve Clay oughta publish someday) & many many other poems,
most unpublished. She's been in NYC (after 4 years in Mexico) a year, but don't
think she's read more than once. Come on, People in Charge: Ask her to read!

Eric Malone--consistently omitted from "Boston" issues despite being (my
opinion) Boston's finest, second only to Wieners (also omitted from some mag's
recent "Boston" issue). Early writing published: Evening Dispatch
(Hornswoggle). Mountains of other, more significant: A Backwards Book, Magic
Marker Poems, October--well, lots more. Spicer, Berrigan, Lansing, Blaser, S
tein, Whalen (from '64 on) big influences. A Backwards Book effect maybe like
hearing Enochian (sp.?) & suddenly "getting it," but at a level just beneath
the skin. Not without wit: "Experimental literature? Or the effect of 10
volumes on colonial furniture . . ." Special Bonus: Looks remarkably like David
Letterman!

Kimberly Lyons--well, SURELY others on this list have read her work & have
infinitely more intelligent things to say than I do. I've only seen Mettle
(sp.?), which Granary recently put out.

Don David--a couple of chaps (from Spectacular Diseases?), work in Long News
and Mirage. At least one collection, The Persecution (I think?), unpublished.
Some of the most bizarre, visceral and (I think) intelligently generated
sex-related writing I've read.

John McNally--wow, best ear of anyone I know. Aetherstock, which he published
in an edition of--what?--10 copies?--one of the few things I brought with me to
New York. Another Gertrude Stein winner.

Jeff Conant--most consistently successful overtly political poetry as poetry
I've read since the late Daniel Davidson's. One chap, Breathing Problems
(whut). Stein winner last time, I think. Post Project did a swell selection of
his prose: "Help Save America for the Goodguys." Last I heard Buck Downs Books
was bringing out a new one. Did they?

Work by the above names & a few others (Colleen Lookingbill, Bob Harrison, Ange
Mlinko, Daniel Davidson) a significant portion of my library--and, Ron &
others, would probably be of yours too, if there was any money to publish it.
No question but that it's every bit as generative, significant, important--take
your pick--as work by others, prior, everyone's seen. I've read Perelman's
early poetry (his Iowa thesis) and believe me, Conant's similarly early work is
more advanced, his ear already better developed. We simply don't have any
equivalent these days to the NEA & the West Coast Print Center, etc., of the
70s, 80s. The work itself is here. Where are you?

I'm glad you made that point-- and I think it might be that context is
really important to these poems. I would also wonder about Hughes's
awareness of his language, how he plays it against other things. I don't
want to leap to easy judgements.


It does have a very 1960's ring....


Actually my first thought was that it sounded "Plathy"! I'd have to look
at it again.

to the comments made by michael, jacques, bill, and by extension joshua a
few days ago.

re critical vocabularies adequate to describing innovations be they those
of the 60s 70s or 90s.  while langpo certainly carried a critical
vocabulary with it, we are only still beginning to describe the various
writing practices of this "mvmt," no?  perelman makes this point: take the
20 writers in the messerli anthology, then there are 40 in the silliman
anthology, 20 of whom are not in messerli, then take all the people in
peter ganick's anthology, plus the 82 people silliman mentions in his
preface (some of whom are in ganick i'm sure), we're looking at upwards of
100 writers here, each of whom would have to be considered individually in
terms of their own career trajectories and then against one another.

in other words, the "history of langpo" is one big livre a venir, one for
which a writer/critic of my "generation" may not have sufficient critical
distance.  yet were we to write this history, to digest *all* of this
writing, yes by all means.  to me it's all new, only having come to
bernstein three years ago, coolidge only very recently and via watten,
watten still to come, tho with some very useful pointers thanks to the
recent discussions here.  but for what?  to master, to contain, to
taxonomize and rank innovation according to form, lexicon, degrees of
syntactic rupture, etc.? (doubtless a worthwhile project,...)

and then to emulate accordingly?  rather, i think, the "passion for
confluence" bill marsh describes.  to stand awash amidst the baroque
proliferation.

i wd point to bill howe's ongoing homophonic translations of emily
dickinson, or christian bok's vowel poems-in-progress.  one cd point to
any number of prior texts from which these may be said to be "derivative"
without at all contesting the striking originality of these works.

at what point do "innovative" or "derivative" continue to be meaningful
tags?

MULTIMEDIA SAN FRANCISCO HISTORY INAUGURATED

Announcing a landmark project in the discovery, sharing, and reclaiming
of
San Francisco's history.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

City Lights Books presents Reclaiming San Francisco: History, Politics,
Culture, edited by James Brook, Chris Carlsson, and Nancy J. Peters.
Here
is a City Lights anthology of fresh appraisals of the contrarian spirit
of
the city--a spirit "resistant to authority or control." The official
story
of San Francisco is one of progress, development, and growth. But there
are
other, unofficial, San Francisco stories, often shrouded in myth and in
danger of being forgotten, and they are told here: stories of immigrants
and minorities, sailors and waterfront workers, artists and neighborhood
activists--along with the stories of speculators, land-grabbers, and the
land itself. San Francisco is not alone in being transformed according
to
the dictates of the global economy. But San Franciscans are unusual in
their readiness to confront the corporate agenda for their city. On sale
at
bookstores. $17.95 (ISBN: 0-87286-335-2)


     "A breathtaking ride through a dozen different cities called San
     Francisco."
     --Mike Davis, author of City of Quartz

     "The radical energy that animated San Francisco is pulsing in these
     pages, as does dismay at its murder by greed and promotion."
     --Andrei Codrescu, author of The Dog with the Chip in Its Neck

     "This book celebrates the fact that we live in the most glorious of
     all human creations, a city, with living streets . . . . Read it to
     understand why San Francisco is still alive--and how we have to
defend
     it."
     --Joan Holden, San Francisco Mime Troupe


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cloverleaf Multimedia Productions announces a magnificent new CD-ROM,
Shaping San Francisco. This is the product of three years of work by a
group of local historians, community activists, computer workers,
artists,
academics, and librarians. Recipient of a California Council for the
Humanities grant in 1996, the project has also enjoyed support from
several
dozen private donors, although not enough to underwrite a paid staff.
Consequently, over 10,000 hours of labor has been donated. The producer,
Cloverleaf Multimedia Productions, was founded in 1994 by Chris
Carlsson,
Greg Williamson, and Jim Swanson to bring a radical political
sensibility
to computer multimedia. This exciting exploration of our history will be
available on public kiosks around the city, in community centers, and at
branch libraries.

The CD will also be on sale at $35.00.

A web site (http://www.shapingsf.org) will offer a sample of the full
public kiosk CD-ROM, while providing an on-line forum for further
contributions, criticism, and comment. The project will continue to grow
and develop as people and groups contribute their own stories, archival
materials, and original research.

        I'm sure I can...  KENNING is a "newsletter" of new & ostensibly
innovative poetry, poetics, and other genres of non-fiction writing, based
on a notion that contemporary poetics (of variable & various stripes &
spots & degrees of avantness) is an integral facet of progressive social
discourse.  The mag. is modestly priced & produced almost solely on
demand.  KENNING's premier issue is due out about a month from now, edited
by myself, with Mark Wallace, Juliana Spahr, John Kinsella, and others set
to appear.  More info as it comes available.  Submissions are accepted at
the address below or via e-mail.  & thanks for asking.  --  Patrick F.

Ron Silliman formulated an equation that said that the formal New and the
contentual New can never occupy the same place....Ron, do I have that
right? Is that still a formulation you stand by, and if so, could you post
it?)

I was pleased to hear from Henry that he had aired the yard-sale notion
where it might do some good. Not pleased that it hadnt been acted on. No,
we're not Bevery Hills. A lot of our sales were early in the morning, to
people who live (or augment their living) by buying cheapest and selling
slightly dearer--some were en route to the "official" flea market that's
held every weekend at the south end of town, and we were at the north end,
and a lot of these dealers live north of town, where the housing is
cheaper. I mean, location is everything : one needs to consider that.

Other notions in case there are listlings who want to be free of the
literary establishments in their neighborhoods (with the chokehold on
budgets, etc) :
make Round Table Pizza your venue. Layne Russell of this list did just that
last sat nite, bringing some 30 of us together for a poetry reading in a
private room at RTP. It cost nothing : RTP is glad of the custom. Layne
booked about 10 days in advance. Fifty or more could have been fit into
that space. Although the room had windows that gave onto the surrounding
restaurant, it was pretty much soundproof (therefore far preferable to
coffee-shops, with their ringing registers and growling Smoothie-mixers and
coffee-grinders). Plenty of parking on site. This room is even equipped
with a large tv screen and vcr capability, so that we can have an evening
of poetry tapes if we want. And beer and wine (well, of a kind) are
available.

Don Byrd's post re-*pre*NEA days reminds me that at Berkeley in the 60s,
some of us formed an on-campus club, which gave us access, for a nominal
fee, to lecture halls where we put on poetry readings. We were allowed to
charge an entrance fee, although perhaps it was disguised as a donation. In
those years of rising poetry popularity, we often had 150 or 200 in the
audience; I remember we were able to pay the likes of Robert Duncan and
Robert Creeley and Diane Di Prima and, I think, Ed Dorn, something like
$150 honoraria--surely about $600 in today's money.  We did this because
the Arts & Lectures series brought to campus poets who, in the words of one
of my associates in the enterprise, Ron Loewinsohn, were dead but didnt
know enough to fall down (and this despite the input of "The Book of Beat"
Tom Parkinson.)-- Even the most, uh, librul (or even redickul) among the
Tenured have incurred a certain amount of damage during their ascension,
have feuded with writers whom the students would love to hear but never
will (due to these wounds), and the Poetry Club is one way to by-pass these
Great Limping Albert Rosses (as Sherril Jaffe dubbed them). We paid
membership dues--maybe $2 per term? Say $8 in today's money. This also was
an incentive to attend all the readings (to get your money's worth). I
think we got in for $1, whereas non-members got in for $1.50.

These days, a likely turnout would be considerably smaller. But still, 40
people paying an average of $5 each = $200, and that, less venue-rent,and
expense of a mailer,would probably net $120.

These are some ways of working with The System to take the power back.  David

I think that "derivative" stopped being a dirty word with postmodernism. Even
Harold Bloom has a rather nice take on the word (as he redefines it) in _A Map
of Misreading_.

Don Byrd wrote of how the NEA brought perfect binding for little magazines
and small press books, but did nothing to solve the distribution problem.
He suggested that if they had given money to libraries to "buy small press
and little magazine material, instead of giving it directly to publishers
to publish that problem could have been in part solved".

I wonder. The Canada Council in its 1970s days of wealth sent small press
books to libraries for free. They have pretty well all been sold off (at
$.50 a pound) or discarded.  I got Mike Yates' "The Breat Bear Lake
Meditations" for 50 cents, Mary de Raschewitz' "Discretions" for $1, and on
and on it goes. Public libraries, at least the ones I know, cull any book
that has not been borrowed for the previous 4 years. After 20 years, that
is pretty well the whole lot.

Don also notes:

>>People started tailoring their work to the NEA, not to the issues of the
necessities of their work. <<

The Canada Council also has this effect.

>> It seems to me frankly that a great deal of the weariness in the poetry
scene can be traced directly to the NEA.  You cannot expect a government to
fund revolutionary art.<<

Mind you, it's not just revolutionary art that suffers. Even basic and
necessary extensions of conservative art, filling in regional and class
blanks, completing a pattern, bringing the wealth, so to speak, to the
furthest reaches of society, suffer. The consequence: vast areas are left
out of the swim.

>>The Humanities were offered to the New Left of 60s as a kind of
preserve.<<

Don, I like your idea about the 560 megabyte CDs, as long as we are careful
not to help build our new preserve. That is, distribution beyond the
boundaries of electronic access is just as important as distribution beyond
the boundaries of the NEA- or University English Department- or Canada
Council-defined book.

As a fledgling small press publisher, I'd like to jump into these
discussions about funding, new writers, the problems we all face
getting work out there and getting it discussed, etc.

And by way of an announcement, I'd like to mention that Graham Foust,
newly recruited by the University at Buffalo's soon-to-be division IA
football team, will be now helping me carry the ball. No longer will I
be stuck trying to break through the tough defense which mounts
against us all by myself. (BTW the UB football team is called the
Bulls, which I find very amusing--

OK OK, so for real. Meow Press has suffered from my having had to do
all this myself. I've not had an interest in doing it that way, except
that it just worked out that when the books needed to be folded, I was
the only one there. It's somehow embarrassing to ask for help, I
guess. I don't know. Graham's editorial interest will mean a
significant change for the press. It seems that for many people on
this list, being the student of Charles Bernstein means that I would
have his interests, that I would imitate him, etc. And it is a strange
opinion. I would love to see an analysis of any of the Buffalo poetics
grads' writings (who are in actuality,,shhhh,,really english grads)
which demonstrates that Charles is here deploying clones. If there is
a specific case of this "student of langpo" /wannabe, etc. then please
let's talk about it. I keep thinking that I know what's being
discussed, but the materials of the material text seem to be elided
here. As Jim Rome would say, "Have a take and don't suck"


Before Graham agreed to accept a share in the ideological
responsibility for the books soon to be published by Meow Press, I was
really disturbed by my own editorial policy. I am not nor have I ever
been comfortable making good / bad judgements about people's writings.
Nor am I really interested in propping up some formal technique over
another. But that isn't to say that one press or another "must"
publish this or that... and then there seems to be an awful lot of
pressure to reduce the amount of poetry that's out there. As if too
much poetry is a bad thing. Perhaps it waters down the genius, I don't
know. And it isn't that I like every poem I read, or every poem that I
publish. It's my suspicion that social concerns (both swell and
dubious) come into play far more often than ever get discussed.
Perhaps that is taboo. But I'll tell you, I've received fan letters
from people trying to reach certain Meow authors, people who aren't
part of this national-matrix, and who I published because I wanted to
help them. And I don't feel bad about that. Often those books are very
"popular"--and certainly here locally those are the books that sell
out at Talking Leaves Books, or the new usedbookstore, Rust Belt
Books. It is my opinion, and my desperate interest, that books and
poetry participate in such a community. If my book came out and
disappeared into the realms of some virtual debate I didn't have
access to--well, what's that worth? Chapbooks offer something that is
more modest, something small. Does that seem right? Does it seem
absurd? Isn't that the goal: that our poems would participate in the
world that we inhabit? And so yeah, whatever. I must seem pretty
silly.

These are just thoughts. For what they're worth. Those of you who are
waiting for books (ordered or to be published), rest assured. Graham
Master Foust is here to make it all right. And he's not a langpo, is
he? Graham---are you out there? Graham, what do you wannabe?

Even better -- actually, much better than going to oedipally-challenged Gloomy

Subject:      a squint at strabismus
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Odd that Craig Hill brought up Schorn's "Strabismus" when he did, as I had
just read, that morning, in Zukofsky's "An Objective":

"Strabismus may be a topic of interest between two strabismics; those who
see straight look away."

First thoughts:  My dictionary defines 'strabismus' as "the inability of one
eye to attain binocular vision with the other because of imbalance of the
muscles of the eyeball."  'Squint' is given as a synonym, though 'crosseyed'
sounds closer.   (The etymology of the term may also be related to that of
'strophe.')  Assuming that Schorn's allusion to Z. is not inadvertent, and
putting the matter simplemindedly, I would guess that the former is arguing
for subjectivity as against Z's apparent rejection of a 'perverse,' 'sick,'
or 'deficient' way of seeing as appropriate for poetry.  (Or, Schorn may
simply be addressing other squinters.)  This helps a lot with the first
piece in the book, "Entering Poetic Blindspots," which shifts quickly from
manifesto to the kind of image-torque that Hill mentions:

"We must force ourselves into the danger of not seeing in order to see the
poem more clearly, to see it as clearly as the head of a giant pin being
thrust through the walls of the mouth."

The notion of an "asymptote" (the book's thrird section), the line that a
plane curve approaches or approximates but never touches, seems similarly
related to Schorn's approach to narration.

I see J. Debrot's characterization of the Burning Deckness of it all, but
Schorn's work is also more than a bit similar to some recent writers who
definitely think of their work as fiction, not poetry.  I'm thinking of Ben
Marcus, Gary Lutz, and Diane Williams, all pub'd by Knopf, all often found
in -StoryQuarterly- and -Conjuctions- (see #26 for a Marcus-edited section
w/ Williams, Lutz, and a very interesting sustained piece by Schorn).  I
don't know anything about Schorn's provenance, but I suspect the rest of
these folks are latter-day Lish-disciples. I've always idly wondered how
this Lish/Knopf cabal operates, constantly producing slim volumes of short
stories that I never meet anyone who reads.  But I'm digressing--Schorn's
writing, accidentally or not, gives off a similar sense that determinate
events are being represented in unrationalizable terms, though without the
kind of sublimation or repression that makes Marcus or Williams seem
'psychological' in intent.

Has anyone else here read the other folks I mention (Marcus' -Age of Wire
and String- is one of the strangest works I've come across for a while),
even with contempt?

Steve,

I think of myself as lovingly prodding younger writers to go that next step
further (it's a big one). I'll sing a new song when a new one is warranted.

I concur with David re the functional irrelevancy of the NEA. It may have
helped some book publishers, notably The Figures, Roof and Sun&Moon, but all
the major events of the '70s were done without its assistance.

David,

I've written at times about the conflict between form/content (as distinct
from mere extension), but don't think I ever quite put it the way you
suggest. See "Wild Form" on my EPC web site (soon to be part of the Quarry
West issue).

Steve's list of younger writers is a superb starting place, tho far too
short. Laurie Price, whom somebody else mentioned, has been writing great
work for at least 15 years that I know of. The real question is why has it
taken so long for a first big book to come out.

Yes, X recorded "Shoot Out the Lights" in muddy-tho-decent fashion, but
since people on the list have been talking lately about songwriters whose
lyrics approach/appropriate/approximate poetry, let's give due credit to
the scandalously un-famous (although I think he likes it that way) writer
and performer of the original, Richard Thompson. In Thompson's version, you
hear the words as written. (Though, for the record, John Doe is okay in my
book, too.)

classmate who confidently recited the prayer "Hail Mary, full of gas..."

Subject:      Detail and Concept
Content-Type: text/plain

I¹ll put my formal prejudice aside for the time being to elucidate more
concretely my gripe with langpo.

If you turn to p. 538 of the Norton Anthology of Post Modern Poetry
you¹ll find a selection from Barrett Watten¹s Progress.  What I find
ingenuine about this piece is not the clerical tone or lack of musical
appeal, but the arrogant assumption of a shared conceptual knowledge
with a reader.  I¹ve selected the following stanza which, like the
others, posits broad ideas within closely-related units:

        Comes to the history of words.
                The thought to eradicate
                In him.  The poetry,
                                        by
                Making him think certain ways...

The surprises are syntactical, with broad conceptual leaps.  But the
meaning(s) is distorted by six open words that signify generalizations
outside of the poem:  Œhistory,¹ Œwords,¹ Œthought,¹ Œhim,¹ Œpoetry,¹
and Œways.¹  Now I¹ve been accused in my posts of not being specific
enough.  Why doesn¹t the same charge stand for poetry?  What history of
words does Watten refer to?  Is he implying an etymological process?
How would that Œeradicate¹ something (?) in Œhim?¹  Who is Œhim?¹  Of
course, there¹s no answer to these rhetorical questions because we are
supposed to know how to read this.  This stanza might mean that the
history of words coerce human thought processes.  Watten¹s formal
challenge is to try to write outside of this Œhistory of words.¹  But
the lack of concrete examples in the poem, the reliance on broad and
non-specific conceptual relations combined through the moralizing tone
of this stanza only invite speculation.  It does not inspire curiosity
because nothing remains but a few broad words that repel, not attract,
meanings from this text.
        This poem addresses progress only in vague conceptual terms, not in a
detailed or perceptive language.  Watten offers no examples, only an
opinion.  Stein at least focused on the primacy of things in the
emotional appeal of names.  Watten¹s elevated position as Possessor of
conceptual rather than experiential knowledge undermines the potentially
sympathetic appeal the title of this poem might attract.
        In the same anthology, Bob Perelman is at least clever enough to let
his generalizations function on their own, as fragments of perceived
ideas in his poem, Chronic Meanings.  Here, each line is a sentence
forming a paratactic verse that one could, arguably, see as a mimetic
response to the accumulative pressures of urban life.  Still.  It¹s
length, lack of crescendo and monotone sound structure limits the poem¹s
potential.  Perelman relies on the surprises and small syntactical leaps
between each line rather than developing unified themes throughout the
larger progression of the work as a whole.  He basically takes the
conceit and drives it into the ground, plodding the idea forward through
smart and provocative stanzas.  But the idea is expressed soon enough
and several stanzas could have been cut to spare the reader without
losing the intended impulse of poetic expression.
        The sense of inclusiveness in Ron Silliman¹s work attracted me years
ago.  The feeling that anything is permissible was empowering.  Anything
could go into a poem.  That democratic function is still the most
appealing aspect of his work.  Ketjak and Tjanting are his important
books for me.  He does let Œthings¹ - a dailiness, a reality -  into
those poems.  But without language¹s connective tissue such
non-syllogistic approaches are limited in their appeal simply because
the basic impulses of the work are obscured.  The work remains with the
reader alone to understand.  And unless that reader lives in Leisure
Land there¹s really very little reason to supply his or her own
emotional impulses to the author¹s alienating sentence structures.  That
original socialist impulse that guided the langpods, to my point of
view, is subverted by their own overly intellectualized attempts to find
forms that appeal to their utopic impulses, but that are formally Œnew¹
as well.  Not to deny or in any way diminish whatever pressures they
were faced with 20+ years ago, but to read much of their work, to read
Silliman, a great deal is demanded from a reader who is not in
communication with, but enslaved to, a text that must have meanings
supplied for it.  Such readerly demands assume a life of luxury.  But,
if like most people, you¹ve got a job and certain economic demands of
survival, there¹s little incentive to invest one¹s time with Silliman
because the return does not exceed, or even match, the work put into
reading something like Tjanting.  Maybe that¹s one reason Langpo has
been influential to younger writers who would have come into contact
with it as students, when more time for formal investigations was
available.  Another attraction is the assumption that anything goes.
Langpo gives young writers, it gave me, permission to exercise a
disregard for subject and things, allowing every generalization
imaginable into the poem.  But after a certain period, unless you¹ve got
a career based on it, langpo¹s revolutionary first impacts wane
dramatically.  At least it did for me.

ŒNo ideas but in things,¹ I think, is still the essential aesthetic
statement of our century, at the most basic level.  Tender Buttons at
least reveals an attentiveness to a world of object and space through an
emotional linguistic response to perception.  The formal assumptions of
many langpods made isolated ideas -- broad generalization -- into the
elemental units of their aesthetic projections.  Silliman, Bernstein et
al go to great length in their essays to explain the significance of
this approach.  But if they have to justify their practice through
another formal medium, their poems cannot be seen to generate
sympathetic readings on their own.  Maybe novel or intrigued readings.
But not readings based on any emotional appeal between two humans
engaged with a shared world of potential value.  These generalized and
cerebral appeals cannot *communicate* with the full potential of
language, which also contains an emotional velocity, balanced and
expedient perceptions and brave but sympathetic appeals to a world of
human activity, not conceptual ideals.  Thought adds to an active
intelligence that stems from the perceptual and communicative
capabilities of the poet.  Thought is a tool -- not the source -- of
understanding.

Finally, the langpods seem to be alienating younger generations of
writers with a tyranny of the Œnew.¹  Having exiled already a number of
older poets and traditions to oblivion they stand in danger of isolating
themselves from a future as well, as if poetry only existed for one
brief moment late in the 20th century.

I¹ll conclude this too-long post with a quote from Keats who was onto
this thread long ago.  He writes:

It is easier to think what Poetry should be than to write it‹and this
leads me on to another axiom.  That if Poetry comes not as naturally as
the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all...We hate poetry that
has a palpable design upon us... The Genius of Poetry must work out its
own salvation in a man:  It cannot be matured by law and precept, but by
sensation and watchfulness in itself‹That which is creative must create
itself...

Subject:      "actually new"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Although I admire Ron Silliman's work greatly, I have to agree
with Steve Evans' critique of the implications of Ron's recent Philly
Talks piece, although rather than deal with the issue of NEA funding I'd
like to take a look at the entirely vague claim on which Ron's supposed
critique of writers who have published first/second books some twenty
years after he himself. One of the things I admire about Ron's work is its
constant SPECIFICITY--it seems a shame, in this case, that he has to rely
on a empty catch phrase such as "actually new" without any elaboration of
what he thinks such a term might mean.

        I'm finding it hard to imagine what the phrase "actually new"
might mean if there were some content to it beyond the general place it
occupies in Ron's argument (while at the same time it is meant to carry
the whole weight of his dismissal). The "actual new," I take it, might be
opposed to the "psedo-new" or the "fake new" or perhaps the "artificial
new"? What exactly makes "the new" "actual" is something that Ron never
mentions. Nor does he take up the perhaps even larger question of why
exactly "the new" itself stands in his writing as such an unquestioned
catch phrase for  all significant poetry. Even the
original creator of this slogan, Pound, also understood that "new" meant
creative re-uses and recreations of the past, unless one thinks that all
those classical references in his work had never been used before, or that
Provencal poets were from the 20th century. Indeed Pound may not have felt
he was making creative re-use of the past at all, but rather, was simply
getting the poetic tradition CORRECTLY, taking it from the hands of the
corrupt academicians of modern capitalist slavery.

        Don Byrd's recent comments about how he's bored and has seen it
all before are perhaps equally disheartening, although I'm used to it
from him. Both Ron and Don have
implied, and stated directly in fact, repeatedly the idea that there is
nothing "radical" (or some variation thereof) in the work of later
writers (indeed Don has gone so far as to refer to my own work as
"reactionary," a claim that leaves me somewhat bemused). Then, of course,
their definition of radical turns out to
be their own practice, or some variation of it that does not violate THEIR
unwavering sense of what constitutes "radical." With the assumption in place
that one's own work constitutes the "radical," then any other poetry can
only be one of two things--derivative of you, or "not radical." A nice
double bind there, and I'm tempted to feel a CHEAP one. Indeed it's quite
a typical move for the patriarchal authority that Byrd and Silliman
ostensibly rject (and usually do--I'd be tempted to say "when
it's not their own authority in question," but that would be as
unfairly dismissive as they are)--note that, in such a formulation, the
word "radical" could be replaced by the word "traditional" and BE THE
EXACT SAME ARGUMENT that more aesthetically conservative poets use to
guard the boundaries of their own poetics. I wonder whether Ron and
Don will consider whether a critical perspective that sees the similarity
between their own poetics and the "conservatives" they reject constitutes
for them "the radical"? I wonder what it would mean if they did not.

        Let me be perfectly clear then: the problem is not that there is
no "actually new" poetry. Certainly there is such poetry, just as there is
poetry for which the notion of the "actually new" is itself a question,
rather than a certainty. The problem is, instead, that "the new" or "the
radical" for both Byrd and Silliman is a tightly defined, unchanging
category--that is, their definition of "the radical" or "the new" is
traditional in
precisely the worst sense. Byrd and Silliman have sometimes therefore
chosen to play exactly the role that older patriarchal authorities (of
poetry and other activities) have traditionally played in western
culture--the dismissal of the new on the grounds that it does not meet the
standards of the old. Haven't we seen this move before, from men (I use
this word pointedly) supposedly as disparate as Matthew Arnold and Robert
Duncan? That Byrd and Silliman use the "radical" as their standard for the
old certainly should grant them points for ingenuity, but seems less
helpful as perceptive critical commentary for those of us crucially
interested in what poetry might do at the present moment. It seems,
finally, a great shame, that two such active and much admired writers
should feel so ungenerous towards the work of writers younger
than they are that their usual critical insight becomes sacrificed for
this vague and empty posturing (and in fact both HAVE been quite generous
at times). Indeed it reminds me again how grave is
the individual disappointment that haunts the world of avant
garde poetries, for if one can find no value in the work of others, must
it not be because one feels that no one else has found the value in their
own work? Byrd and Silliman must, I think, feel BETRAYED by the work of
poets who come after them. Whether justified or not (and I think, of
course, that it is not), I can find no cause for celebration in such a
feeling.

        I don't have the time here to provide close readings of some
poets investigating "the new," but would be glad to send to anyone who
thinks that I CAN'T do it a large number of my own essays and reviews, or
equally to point readers in the direction of critical work being done by
Steve Evans and many many others.

Joel asked what I wanna be:

Sedated, adored, a lifeguard, just like somebody on TV, and your dog.
(That's the Ramones, the Stones Roses, Blotto, Oingo Boingo, and the
Stooges for those of you assembling the soundtrack at home.)

But I, too, am Meow now, and dogs and cats don't mix.  Except when it
rains of course, and it does that plenty in Buffalo.

I'll bring my staplers (all two of 'em).

But seriously Joel, where were you for our 10am publishers meeting
at Starfuckers yesterday?  I had to decide how to use the $10,000
Bernstein had diverted from the SUNY-Buffalo day care center funds to Meow
Press all by myself!  Now I know how you must have felt during the solo
years, brother:  lonely and rich.  By the way, where's the Neiman-Marcus
card?

I just want to do what I have to do to keep this a successful ball club,
which, to me, means publishing small books by people who've published no
books, small or otherwise, and maybe even some really small books by
people who've published small, medium, and/or large books if they're up
for it.  And some ephemera, too, so we'll have secret "in the know" things
to talk about at out-of-town gigs.  But no matter how small Meow books
are, I've noticed that one can always see them if one really tries.  The
point, I believe.  So yeah, there you go.

Now that I've completed my first official week as co-elf, I'd like to
issue my first decree/promise to all you poetics fans out there:  Meow
Press will publish no books by Ted Hughes this year.  Thank you and
goodnight.

Hi mom,

Graham

p.s. As of Monday, January 19th, 2pm, Poetics at Buffalo (the band, not
the list) has officially disbanded.  Various solo projects, duo projects,
and reunion tours to follow.

p.p.s.  Another "thmup" here for Brian Schorn.  Thanks, Poetics (the list,
not the band), for bringing it off my shelf again.

I just read your message to the list, which was interesting and very
very provoking, once again. I have a number of thoughts that strike me
immediately, and I'll give you a taste of it here as I'm not sure how
much I will be able to develop my response before the barrage of
replies begins.

While you offer a very interesting reading of the Watten poem, I'm
going to have to cite it here, as I have a few questions:

"Now I1ve been accused in my posts of not being specific enough.  Why
doesn1t the same charge stand for poetry?  What history of
words does Watten refer to?  Is he implying an etymological process?
How would that ‘eradicate1 something (?) in ‘him?1  Who is ‘him?1  Of

supposed to know how to read this.  This stanza might mean that the
history of words coerce human thought processes.  Watten1s formal
challenge is to try to write outside of this ‘history of words.1  But
the lack of concrete examples in the poem, the reliance on broad and
non-specific conceptual relations combined through the moralizing tone
of this stanza only invite speculation.  It does not inspire curiosity
because nothing remains but a few broad words that repel, not attract,

I find it odd that you think that Watten's language here
"... only invite[s] speculation.  It does not inspire curiosity..."
How about "inspiring speculation and inviting curiosity" or
"speculating curiously" or "curious speculation" or "speculous
curiosity" or ... you get the point. Inspiration I guess is relative.

Do you really think that Watten is trying to write "outside" the
history of words? That's kind of a silly take on what that stanza
says. One of the joys of syntax and punctuation is that they are
usually incredibly specific in what they can mean. I'll never forget
the frightening moments of REAL ambiguity in some of vergil's syntax
in aeneid, when whether the whole trip to the underworld may have been
a dream, etc...and this craggy old philologist is trying to tell me
its one way, but the language on the page looks very much like it
could be taken the other way. (It's been some years). Anyhow, Watten
does not here seem to be leaving it open. The leaps that are being
taken here seem to be largely your own.

I have found Watten's work to be littered with the experiential, so
your claim for him only to be conceptual professor is off the mark.
But he's subtle, so you've got to read harder.

Some of what you're askin of the poem: "what history of words" "who is
him" etc. seems to take all the fun out of reading. Why read poetry?
You want poems to be like essays? I thought it was supposed to be the
other way around...I don't see that stanza as argumentative, which
your mode has been, and that is the only reason  that I asked for
something specific to talk about. Who is the "Him" of a Shakespeare
sonnet? Isn't that ambuiguity (while dated) one of the definitions
poetic language? You seem to suggest that poems can only mean one
thing, ya ya ya.

You say Watten is moralizing, but I find the quote from Keats to be
pretty much the paragon of moralizing. What do you think? And isn't
your whole notion about how texts should be closed enough to cause an
emotional response between 2 people, based in things, doesn't that
strike you as the least bit moralizing?--I'm curious as to what you
think of Zukofsky, who skates, it seems, between what you decry and
what you applaud. Obviously, there'll be work that you like and work
that you don't. Also--I would bet that the jingle "no ideas but in
things" would end up pretty much a slogan manufactured by the
idea-industry of poetic statement and if you really read Williams you
see far more ideas than things. Someone here was doing an annotation
of Zukofsky's marginal notes to a ms. version of The Wedge, which WCW
had asked him to edit, and my guess is that LZ had a big part in that
post-production design process known as editing (like Pound's take on
Wasteland) Also, wouldn't a poetry "devoid" of ideas (full of things)
end up where you don't want to be, i.e. with Steinian objects and
Silliman's quotidian accumulation? Anyhow, I don't think that is
really going anywhere.

These are just quick thoughts. By the way, as a student, I find that I
don't have any time for formal innovation whatsoever. So I don't know
what you're talking about there. I find that there is all sorts of
economic pressure to "give the people what they want" and even my work
on Mac Low has revolved mostly around his political and social
connections of the 40s and such. Nobody wants to hear another
theorization of chance-operations, or whatever you want to call them,
as being "like" some kind of anarchist epistemology. It's always
"like" never "is" and its the leap of the simile there that causes all
the problems. I think that Mac Low would be among the first to admit
that poems in and of themselves aren't the things that are going to
save the world. There's plenty of work to be done, if that's your bag.

Also--as someone who used to drag his typewriter to the midnight shift
at a gas station, I'd beware of dumbing it down for "working people."
Remember, for every intellectual in a warehouse, there's a pot of
tomatoes on a rooftop...

With all the sharp dialogue on the new, the old, and the unknown -

is to be a serious investigative scholar: Trapender's work is scattered
in the most obscure ephemeridae unknown.  I've been studying his output
now for 5 years, and would be happy to backchannel bibliographic

It's a poem. There is no way through which anyone is supposed to read it,
just as there never was or is with almost any other poem. I can't think of
the exceptions, but someone must have a list of them  -  somewhere.

What I've often admired about Barrett's work, amongst many admirations it
generates, is the dark humour discontinuously moving among its surfaces.
'He' frequently disturbs any 'got it' mentality by a 'what am i trying to
get and what might that "got it" tell me once it's "In him", i.e. in my
bag?' (both in respect of 'myself' and in respect of 'him') in the process,
thereby debunking exactly what this little passage you've so perceptively
chosen identifies. Following the narrative introduction 'Comes to the
history of words', ie there is potential character here (Thus spake
Beowulf, his shining blade  -  tongue in pocket) 'The thought to eradicate
/ In him. The poetry,' leads directly towards a mud wrestling between
presence and absence more fully played at volume in his 'Under Erasure'.

Read it specifically then:

'The [not A] thought to eradicate'

(releases exactly your critique, in that he is decrying THE thought and
encouraging specificities stemming from A thought. He is suggesting that
such generalities won't do  -  they are tied to lazy thinking, which either
actively predispositions itself towards or else passively condones
attitudes of destruction. This is a poem that critiques the very notion of
progress as a fixity to be pocketed and owned).

Read that sentence again as 'The thought   -   to eradicate  -  In him.'
Becomes a critique of competetive (if not downright warring) male tropes,
offering a pithy, wry performance 'doubleness' through self-critique at one
and the different time.

s p a c e   -  let the line 'The though to eradicate' float, there's a
whole lot of space following it and more still to come before the next
(however habitually one's eyes might negate it  -  a materiality of page
and book as much as of the marks that articulate such sites), even though
the indented alignments of the 'internal' lines in each stanza are 'framed'
by the top and bottom. even though the bottom line each time visibly
discourages closure  . . . . (i notice you left one of the dot dot dots
off, what did you mean by that?) 'In him. The poetry,
        by'

This is a gorgeously ludic toying with the persona of 'male poet', 'In him.
The poetry' (that THE again). There's a serious point and a ribbing here.
And why, whilst we're at it should we presume that Barrett is not also
present throughout. I mean, this work is not being assembled by rote. It is
motivated. Each word and each unit of sense is motivational. Sometimes that
motivation is one thing cancelling out the next, one building constructing
on the site of another's demolition. Sometimes there is a dialectical
tension mobilised. Often though a teasing interplay between serious
construction and playful undermining of the stasis born out glib
satisfaction with knowing, or the supposition of knowing 'how to read it'.

I haven't even got to that last line . . .

And btw i really don't read poetry this way at all, just teasing your sense
of coming up empty handed on this one. How does:

'How he, reclining on the limp edge of
wet dawn, divines rhetorically the stem
of his life which purports a kissing wind,
baguettes, managerial consistency, and
he is seen by too many people. It is'

make you feel? It's the opening of O'Hara's 'Hermaphrodite'. (1954?)
Or:

'Triangle to Bach
Is triangle to me - and
A clown's hat and a lovely hair pie
(Turn it over in your heads.)

Like I mean you
Aren't questions, each of you
Is an answer,
But you'd gone, all of you afraid'

from Whalen's 'Esprit d'Escalier Rant' (1957)

The 'good' stuff, for me, often unveils such nagging densities.
There is no 'how' or no 'know how' the reading of negative capabilities.


love and love

Kent et al:  Sane excepts from Hightower's show are also printed in many

Et al: Would one of the people who has been discussing Lisa Jarnot mind
posting a representative piece of hers for those who don't have her books?

Henry:  your anecdote about the 365-line piece reminded me of Spenser's

Hi, Rachel:

How are you? Loved the Lewis Carroll quote. As to what a "glass book" is:

Literally, glass pages, with text silk-screened on, in white. Don't have the
text with me, unfortunately. To give you some idea of the effect of this: Pages
can be stacked onto each other--overlay schema so certain words're repeated,
given 3-dimensional push upward, toward viewer. At least two events happen this
moment: (1) the words repeated lose former "transparency" (their materiality
made blatant) and (2) a second "narrative" thread is made visible.
("Transparency" obvious issue: glass is, duh, transparent.) As pages are
stacked onto each other, new narrative threads, or trajectories if you prefer,
become visible, generating tension, a kind of "gravity" I guess, as former
"meaning" of the text on the first glass sheet becomes bent into second, third,
fourth & so on "meanings" of new sheets & confluences between sheets. This, by
the way, strikes me as an example of "wild form" (just having read the
referred-to essay), her book making manifest, in the reading of it, a sense of
causality (George Albon is, I think, writing on causality right now),
relationships/-shifts, slowing & speeding up of perceived time--the book's
value maybe less social (why, as suggested in "Wild Form," is consideration of
form limited to its merely social situation(s)?), more philosophical &
"scientific" (bad word choice; I mean, manifestation of consideration of nature
of physical existence as warped by perceptive organs & extensions ((glasses,
microscopes, the book, language, other filters, overlays)) ) . . .

Anyway, glass being ultimate transparency, to put words down on glass suggests
initial overlay: e.g., language as overlay; subsequent overlayings of sheet
upon sheet, word upon word secondary overlays. I do wish I had the text,
though. The writing's extraordinary, not separate from the form: The piece
strikes me as thoroughly successful FORM/CONTENT interweave, or coupling,
co-generative, ultimately there as ONE.

Now, for the person who asked why it took (at least) 15 years for Laurie's
first full-length collection to arrive; well, who knows? I've sent my own first
couple of collections out to all the groovy presses still doing full-length
books and most presses don't bother even returning the SASE. Those who do
reject. Best rejection letter: "I can't look at new work right." Yes,
"sic"--editor forgot to add "now"--but "can't look at new work right" probably
closer to the case. The one thing of mine published, a "novella," Dead Man, by
Meow Press (Hi, Joel!), kind of a fluke. I met Joel, who I really liked, when
he came out to visit Charles Alexander at the MCBA in Minneapolis. I sent him
Dead Man to read, not thinking of ever publishing it (er, copyright
complications...), & got a call a couple months later saying Meow wanted to add
it to its list. Wow! Very generous of Joel to do. A plug for Meow & Joel (from
someone w/an admittedly personal investment): He's truly indefatigable, his
project thoroughly open, the books utilitarian w/out being ugly, attractive
w/out being precious, the work taken en toto as if Meow an antenna picking up a
wide range of activity, filtering it through "the press." (See the Poetry
Project Newsletter review of the press last issue. ((I think Katie Leder or
Lederer wrote it--anyone know who that is?)) )

Wanna respond more to "Wild Form"--maybe later. Thanks for asking about
Laurie's glass book, Rachel. Hope you're doing well.

Yours,

Thanks to Gary Sullivan, Crag Hill & others whove been posting pointers
to names not normally in the wordstream here.  For me it has the quality
of unrequited tease since I havent been able to afford a book of poetry
for years & only really spend time with works Ive traded for & libraries
(other than Dreamtime's archive) are a universe away.  These kinds of
introductions are & should be endless in such a vast poetic universe &
we are our own remedy for the crisis in distribution, promotion &
criticism.  I welcome the shift from so much book production toward more
genuine & personal forms of networking & exchange along with an
acknowledgement that it's ok the be the best guardian of one's own work,
that expecting some unknown other out there to give your wordsweat its
due recognition is happenchance at best. Im searching for a manifesto I
wrote about appropriate publishing, will try to post it in the next
couple days, about archival sensibility & print on demand bookmaking,
which of couse is accessible to each & everyone of us, even my friends
in the mountains of rural Russia.

Tom Mandel's post encapsulates the trouble with all anecdotal poetry. I can
well imagine such a poem (not that Tom makes that claim for it) being read
aloud and the way the audience would nod its heads & sigh acquiescence.
Shucks, why bother with yard sales at all, Clem? There's a bound to be
somethin' wrong with whatever you buy they-r!

(Hey--one way to know you're a redneck is, when somebody knocks on the door

Well, yard sales might be beneath Tom Mandel, de gustibus disputandum

down at that flea-market?!), but I got some GREAT STUFF at the ones I
mentioned yesterday. Artie Shaw's "Backbay Shuffle" for one buck! a couple
of Nina Simone's for a dollar a piece. All unscratched. The shorter novels
of Stendahl for $3. A sweater I'm wearing as I type this, $4, an unholey
bargain. So don't let Uncle Tom from the nation's capital discourage you,

I thought Graham Foust's post today was one of the most delightful I've
read on this list. It was not overly burdened with "something to say,"
therefore it had more chance to say itself superbly. Kudos, Graham!  And it
was a necessary saying.

I am tempted to emulate, though knowing I'll fall far short. Graham's use
of the phrase wanna be reminded me of a question (one of several, including
"where does he get that stuff?") stirred up by Dale Smith's recent posts.
Usually, a "wannabe" is someone despicable. But a "Langpod wannabe" is
surely _less_ despicable than an actual dues-paying Langpod?  It's like a
langpod is someone with a real small weenie, and a langpod wannabe is
someone with an average-size weenie (or even a huge one like GB) who wishes
it were shorter, so he could join the club.

So the hierarchy goes     TOM CLARK / ED DORN    (dead heat)

                          DALE SMITH             (hanging in there, 3rd)

Another great example of grassroots funding is Geri DiGiorno's annual =
Poetry Walk in Petaluma. The Walk is an all-day series of readings, held =
at various venues around the town of Petaluma. DiGiorno started the walk =
on a shoestring (ouch, what a terrible turn of phrase) by soliciting =
contributions from local businesses. =

The first year, her major funder was Empire Waste Management--that's right,=
 the local garbage company.

She also received small donations from bookstores, music stores, coffee =
houses, even pet stores. In exchange, her event brings hundreds of poetry =
listeners into those businesses for the afternoon. =

I like the event for many reasons. It puts poetry center stage in an =
otherwise typical mid-sized town. The audience is not just made up of =
poets but of grocers, pharmacists, waiters, kids, seniors...The selection =
of poets is balanced between local and nationally-known (and some who are =
both). The aesthetic range is broad (last year's poets included Kathleen =
Fraser, Brenda Hillman, Gary Short, Kay Ryan, Jane Hirschfield, Ed =
Kleinschmidt, Tight magazine editor Ann Erickson playing a soundtext =
collaboration with Jake Berry, and Amy Trussell who danced her poem. =

The best part of the event is that the funding comes largely from the =
private sector, so the private sector feels a sense of collaboration. =

Gary,

Katie Lederer is a student at Iowa. She's doing a magazine called =
Explosive, that combines a lot of great poets, both known and unknown. I =
don't have my copy handy, so I can't give you a list, but you should get a =
copy from her c/o Iowa Writers' Workshop, U of I, Iowa City, IA 52242. I =
think it's five bucks, and it's packed with poems.

Annie, Hiatt's books have been very important for me. They led to a lot
of other sources on number symmetries (& a-symmetries) in composition.
It can lead to lax writing if you're overdependent on it. But I liked
Dale's Keats quotes about the poem having a life of its own that you
have to allow for.  When the numerical symmetry & the other formal
elements come together on their own, then you feel like you're
really inside the inner architecture of the poem - in a building.
Especially if you haven't even been counting, until you're finished!
That's what happened when I woke up in the morning & found I had
13 more lines to add.
- Henry G.

p.s. while I'm the topic - check out the "center array" symmetry in
"Drydock, Bilbao"  (http://www.unf.edu/mudlark)  Poster #10).

my greatest bestest find ever at a yard sale was getting Alan Sondheim's
first ESP record (1968) for a quarter.  Id cite the name but it's one of
those names that has the e thing happening with it. alan if youre
listening remind us.  I think given the context of the times the record
was produced in, it is the one of the progenitors of the
abrasive/difficult listening because it can never be reduced to
background music.

A tip of the pin to Lisa Jarnot for including in a handsome number of
smart young poet-critics (jeepers, more contemporaries) during her tenure
at the PoProjNwsltr. This month's "find" is got to be Loren Goodman, whose
review of Kristin Prevallet's Ernstwerk is got to be the funniest thing in
poetry land since Exile folded up its little hat. Katy's a poet. She's
finishing up her umfah at iowuh. There are gamblers in her family, she
used to be in San Francisco, she edits the terrific and well-loved poetry
mAgazine called Explosive. Now to switch back to the Newsletter, it is
vewy vewy important that you read Lisa's interview with Bernadette Mayer,
which if there is any hope for you will set you straight! Finally a poetry
interview in which the poets talk like people! About things!

Dale, is it possible that the part of the Stein influence on
contemporaneity that bugs you most is the apparent aimlessness?
affectlessness? If you dip in to Stein in the middle she can seem aimless
and affectless, but this is because she is going very very slowly. Or
quickly, same thing. That steindip bugs me when I get it on my likmstik.
But no kinds of love are better than others. Which reminds me, don't you
wish Bob Dylan was as smart as Lou Reed? Bob doesn't catch up to Lou until
the early 80s, I think, around "Tight Connection to my Heart", but that's
only because Lou'd been asleep for about a decade.

david,

i just had a garage sale last weekend with a couple of friends. we didn't
make a whole lot, probably $20 after buying lunch for everybody. kinda
disappointing as i was hoping the money raised could help offset my son's
soccer club fees (and said soccer team is having a garage sale later this
month to help do the same thing). just establishing my credentials to say i
thought that, if anything, tom's post was pro-garage sale. you DO have to
look out when buying things at garage sales that are made up of pieces that
are important to the whole (ie puzzles and games). and i thought that this
reflected a garage-sale lover's savvy on the part of jesse ("savvy" looks
like "sawy" on my screen).

you say savvy, i say sawy.

but in your wake, and very mcu (much) more humbly re:

It's a poem. There is no way through which anyone is supposed to read it,
just as there never was or is with almost any other poem. I can't think of
the exceptions, but someone must have a list of them  -  somewhere.

What I've often admired about Barrett's work, amongst many admirations it
generates, is the dark humour discontinuously moving among its surfaces.
'He' frequently disturbs any 'got it' mentality by a 'what am i trying to
get and what might that "got it" tell me once it's "In him", i.e. in my
bag?' (both in respect of 'myself' and in respect of 'him') in the process,
thereby debunking exactly what this little passage you've so perceptively
chosen identifies. Following the narrative introduction 'Comes to the
history of words', ie there is potential character here (Thus spake
Beowulf, his shining blade  -  tongue in pocket) 'The thought to eradicate
/ In him. The poetry,' leads directly towards a mud wrestling between
presence and absence more fully played at volume in his 'Under Erasure'.

Read it specifically then:

'The [not A] thought to eradicate'

(releases exactly your critique, in that he is decrying THE thought and
encouraging specificities stemming from A thought. He is suggesting that
such generalities won't do  -  they are tied to lazy thinking, which either
actively predispositions itself towards or else passively condones
attitudes of destruction. This is a poem that critiques the very notion of
progress as a fixity to be pocketed and owned).

Read that sentence again as 'The thought   -   to eradicate  -  In him.'
Becomes a critique of competetive (if not downright warring) male tropes,
offering a pithy, wry performance 'doubleness' through self-critique at one
and the different time.

s p a c e   -  let the line 'The though to eradicate' float, there's a
whole lot of space following it and more still to come before the next
(however habitually one's eyes might negate it  -  a materiality of page
and book as much as of the marks that articulate such sites), even though
the indented alignments of the 'internal' lines in each stanza are 'framed'
by the top and bottom. even though the bottom line each time visibly
discourages closure  . . . . (i notice you left one of the dot dot dots
off, what did you mean by that?) 'In him. The poetry,
        by'

This is a gorgeously ludic toying with the persona of 'male poet', 'In him.
The poetry' (that THE again). There's a serious point and a ribbing here.
And why, whilst we're at it should we presume that Barrett is not also
present throughout. I mean, this work is not being assembled by rote. It is
motivated. Each word and each unit of sense is motivational. Sometimes that
motivation is one thing cancelling out the next, one building constructing
on the site of another's demolition. Sometimes there is a dialectical
tension mobilised. Often though a teasing interplay between serious
construction and playful undermining of the stasis born out glib
satisfaction with knowing, or the supposition of knowing 'how to read it'.

I haven't even got to that last line . . .

And btw i really don't read poetry this way at all, just teasing your sense
of coming up empty handed on this one. How does:

'How he, reclining on the limp edge of
wet dawn, divines rhetorically the stem
of his life which purports a kissing wind,
baguettes, managerial consistency, and
he is seen by too many people. It is'

make you feel? It's the opening of O'Hara's 'Hermaphrodite'. (1954?)
Or:

'Triangle to Bach
Is triangle to me - and
A clown's hat and a lovely hair pie
(Turn it over in your heads.)

Like I mean you
Aren't questions, each of you
Is an answer,
But you'd gone, all of you afraid'

from Whalen's 'Esprit d'Escalier Rant' (1957)

The 'good' stuff, for me, often unveils such nagging densities.
There is no 'how' or no 'know how' the reading of negative capabilities.


love and love

        Miekal--it's a good time to think well of Bern, as he busted his

I thought you'd want it. I don't have his hospital address, but he's
probably getting his mail: Bern Porter, Institute of Advanced Thinking, 22
Salmond St., Belfast, Maine (ME) 04915. And thanks, though my beard is

I thought Graham Foust's post today was one of the most delightful I've
read on this list. It was not overly burdened with "something to say,"
therefore it had more chance to say itself superbly. Kudos, Graham!  And it
was a necessary saying.

I am tempted to emulate, though knowing I'll fall far short. Graham's use
of the phrase wanna be reminded me of a question (one of several, including
"where does he get that stuff?") stirred up by Dale Smith's recent posts.
Usually, a "wannabe" is someone despicable. But a "Langpod wannabe" is
surely _less_ despicable than an actual dues-paying Langpod?  It's like a
langpod is someone with a real small weenie, and a langpod wannabe is
someone with an average-size weenie (or even a huge one like GB) who wishes
it were shorter, so he could join the club.

So the hierarchy goes     TOM CLARK / ED DORN    (dead heat)

                          DALE SMITH             (hanging in there, 3rd)

                          WANNABE LANGPOD        (running out of the money)

                          AUTHENTIC LANGPOD      (Pulled up short; shot)

Oh, Pierre -- how could you, vis-a-vis Catskill poets -- how could
you forget the real Catskills -- Sullivan, Ulster, Schoharie,
Delaware County -- we're here, and it's not just a geographical
"here" -- we're active.  We have Word Thursdays, our reading series
and home for poets since 1992, we have Bright hill Press and Out of
the Catskills and Just Beyond, the  380 pp anthology in which your
poems appeared, along with those of John Montague and Donald
Petersen, and Naton Leslie and Jordan Smith and Carol and dick Frost
and Ruth Stone, for God's sake -- we're having a great time out here
in these here mountains, and it ain't Hudson, or on the Hudson.  It's
by the Delaware, and the Schoharie, the Susquehanna, etc. etc. and
beautiful mountains, etc. and there are many of us.  Did you forget?

Thank you Doug & Jordan for Lederer info--I'll definitely check out her mag (&
hopefully spell her name right from now on). Thanks, also, Jordan, for the nice
comment about Exile--yes, I'll check out Goodman's review, too--but, the
Exile's not dead, just waiting for me to get a more-or-less permanent
residence. Didn't I send you the "Corbett" issue? Lemme know; I'll send it
gratis (same goes for anyone else interested). Working now on the "Crank"
issue: featuring Olson's LETTER TO FIELD AND STREAM, Kostelanetz's THEY STOLE
ALL MY IDEAS AND GAVE ME NO CREDIT, & a panel featuring Maya Deren, Ed
Dahlberg, Laura Riding Jackson, etc., etc.

Now, Jordan, I LOVE Bernadette (see my cartoon homage, this issue of Rain
Taxi), but (putting on my Crank Hat), what is this "talk like people! about
things!"? Last night, my friend Fatimah called her family in Nigeria, spoke
with them for a half hour in Howsa. Nigeria's a country made up of some 200
tribes, each with its own language. So, not only could I not understand a word
she said, but neither would many in her native country--unless they're
bilingual. She talked with them about "things," sure, but also about love,
troubles she was having navigating the U.S. arts-funding bureaucracy, the
exchange rate, the fact that the U.S. won't let her fly direct to Nigeria (she
has to fly to France, first--"we" are apparently pissed at the Nigerian
government right now). Again: I couldn't understand a word Fatimah said & I bet
few regular readers of the Poetry Project Newsletter could've either. That mean
she's not "people"? Was it elitist for her not to speak in English so's I
could've understood? Is love a thing? The exchange rate? Methinks you maybe
confuse "things" with "that-which-I-understand." Perhaps? Well, I need to save
my crankiness for the next Exile. Tell you what: I'll read the new PPNewsletter
cover to cover if you promise me you'll check out George Steiner's After
Babylon.

actually sylvester, the post office, with no explanation,  changed
Bern's address from 22 to 50 salmond, tho he's lived in the same place
for years. that's not good news (busted femur) for Bern, being in his
middle 80s, sometimes hard for those things to mend....he has been
making a plea to me to find places for his unpublished works, & we can
only do so much, Im hoping that he'll send on his Abraham Lincoln
Gillespie work for publication.

Things: monogamy, marriage, the social and poetry (don't all say "put on

I'm Katy Lederer! I just joined the list yesterday--

I do edit Explosive Magazine, which features work by wonderful young
writers (and usually one or two older writers). It comes out three times a
year. The covers are each hand-printed, and each poet is allototed an
ample number of pages in which to show off their talents...

If you're looking for a magazine that features a braod range of new
poetries and poetics, feel free to send me five bucks at 420 East
Davenport Stree #2, Iowa City Iowa, 52245.

The fourth issue is going to be out next week and will be featuring lots
of great work by: Prageeta Sharma, Rod Smith, Lisa Lubasch, Eleni
Sikelianos, Darin De Stefano, Mark Salerno, Leslie Scalapino, Gillian
Kiley, Michael Basinski, Travis Ortiz, and Dave Morice.

Past issues have included Lyn Hejinian, Bill Luoma, Ishmael Klein, Greg
Fuchs, and many many others...

Yours,

Even though I don't have exactly the same take as he, Hurrah for
Dale, for speaking out and provoking a very interesting exchange.

And also Hurrah for those who film the strangers fornicating in bed,
and then pull back to show the cameras filming the strangers
fornicating in bed.

Hurrah for those who show the camera in the mirror filming the
cameras filming the strangers fornicating in bed.

Hurrah for the two facing mirrors in which the young post-Language
poet with the conference name tag is reproduced forever and ever.

Hurrah for infinity and name tags, for there would be no poetry
without them.

Hurrah for Dale again, even though (and I _do_ want to make
sure everyuone understands this lest I become seen on this list in a
poor light!) I don't have exactly the same take.

Hurrah for the Anxiety of Influence in 1998. Now Ron Silliman and Don
Byrd can start writing poetic dramas about cathedrals or mandalas.

Hurrah for the Catskill School of Poetry, which apparently exists
outside my own mind.

Hurrah for Paris, not as original as La Paz, but better than
Providence.

Hurrah for this list, which shows minds in control of their language
but not of genre.

Hurrah for that last point. To elaborate: The complete archives
of this list will eventually be seen as the great product of Language
poetry--a monstrously epic, heteroglossic collage that shows minds in
control of their language but (paradox) in blissful ignorance of the
cameras filming them, or of the screen upon which their moaning and
writhing figures were simultaneously projected.

Hurrah for me who could have spent an extra 20 minutes making that
last Hurrah somewhat smarter by elegantly inserting an admission of
my own complicity but didn't.

Hurrah for that long-titled tour de force from David Bromige to Dale,
full of typical brilliance and faultless sentences, couched and
padded in teacherly patience, dripping with anger and violence.

Hurrah for George Bowering's long penis, a penis, apparently, long as
a horse's.

Hurrah for David Bromige, who told the list he has an
unexceptional penis, and also that he had once been "bi" but no
longer, no sirree.

Hurrah for Poems for the Millenium, no question the greatest
anthology ever. I wish Yasusada hadn't been taken out at the last
minute, but I'll get over it.

Hurrah for Alan Ginsberg.

Hurrah for Alan Sondheim. How possible no one has mentioned him in
all this anxiety about the "new"?

Hurrah.

Hurrah.

Hurrah for visual/experimental poets who have goat-farms, and I
really mean that.

Hurrah for those who instead of writing a post about the "new"
called their radio station to get Jim Hightower on the air.

Hurrah for former members of the Communist Party USA who haven't
killed themselves.

Hurrah.

Hurrah for plays whose message is that there is no message. Now we
can spend all day in front of our screens, trying to bite
each others nipples off and confronting death.

Hurrah.

(hip hip) Hurrah.

God, I wish I could have been there.  Not only to enjoy the poetic poipoises,
and another GREAT reading by Cris (she hates that H, for some reason -
probably connects it with somebody on the list) - but we could have
cleared up a lot of these problems about who's important in poetry
these days - Cris has that knack of shelling nuts without cracking them -
did she learn that in the bush?

Subject:      generation underwear

Just a quick thought on the language poetry, generational whango that's
generated so much "lighght" hereabouts.  Ron & Don miss the energy of
the early days.  Steve thinks it has to do with material conditions,
including publishing.  Everybody almost thinks there are more great
poets out there now than anybody realizes fully.

Is it possible the key word for these disparate viewpoints is... dare I
say it... the political climate.  The late 60s possessed a highly intense
political climate of war/repression/chaotic freedom/anarchism, a kind
of free-form politics on the literary level (OK I'm simplifying! Gimme
some slack!!)  By the 90s, everybody's OVEReducated about politics;
politics is all there is; yet there's no simmering energy; there's a
sense of waiting, a void, a boredom, a cynicism, a blandness, a sense
of lack of direction.  (OK I'm simplifying!)  Steve also spoke to this
atmosphere in his "Literary Change" ILS essay.

Now politics is really at the heart of poetry.  But if the language of politics
has led on the one hand to cliche and on the other to a stymied sense of
alienation - a Balkanization - one can see that creating a political poetry
would be a VERY DIFFICULT thing to do.  Especially since we have a sort of
lax oppositional tradition - from Ginsberg down & up in all directions -
which is at once ignorant, arrogant, sentimental, and vulgar about the
moral/historical actualities of politics - the tremendous terror &
grief that can result from unwise, inhumane & callous political decisions.
& how evil can come out of good & vice versa... & what it takes to be
an ombudsman...

however it is these very human complexities which afford the possibility of
a poetry that might stand with the achievements of the past on a human scale.

Now politics is one of those favorite horror topics on this list that
lets everybody expatiate at great length and gas on & on & get away from
the literary issues & actual works out there.  So I will suggest that
we not do that. Let's talk about specific poets & what they've done.

I'm sorry I can't talk about anybody more recent than Auden (I AM 94, you know)
.  Auden is a good example of a slippery figure who can be read as left
or right, political or apolitical, depending on your period.  But one way
to get around that is to see how he uses an accessible language to turn
strictly poetic means to political subjects & VICE VERSA.  & that part of
his accessiblity, for me, is his RECEPTIVITY to past poetries, his ability
to make them new & relevant, if you will; his sense of play & fun which
OPENS UP a poem aesthetically and morally.

Now if we have an exciting poetic scene which is hermetically sealed off
from the general public & mass publishing, this is a very odd situation -
& rather than bemoaning the fact or vaunting "alternatives" of various
kinds, some politically minded poets will see how they can turn it to
advantage.  Probably, I'm sad to say, a lot of clever socialist types
who have no sense of patriotism or national destiny.  Then of course we
can wait for the next guru, blabmeister, culture fig-newton, what have you,
to Rod McKuen us all to another circle of Dantean Boredom...

To crack the nutshell without being crummy, to paraphrase the brilliant
Ben Carrelis - what I mean is, maybe the reason Ron & Don can't see much
happening in the current scene is that the attack they were part of in the 70s
used techniques which because of the very different political climate are
inappropriate at the moment - so even though they see their own epigones
traipsing along in the new sentence & the new split pea paragraph & the
objectivist art item like ever so well they learned from their elders,
their elders can see THEIR OWN TECHNIQUES no longer apply. The weather
has changed; the poetry can't read the weather yet.  Get out yo antennaes,
boy-os & gills!

Since Katha pollitt is a fellow poet, I'm certain that you all read her
piece, I'm O.K., You're P.C. in the January 26th, 1998 Nation. According
to Pollitt, Paul Forman, a curator of Modern Physics at the Smithsonian
here in Washington, wrote "an elegant, erudite and withering review in
Science" of "The Flight from Science and Reason," an anthology of essays
delivered at Paul Gross and Norman Levitt's Conference on Accepted
Science held in New York. Forman had the temerity to point at that the
conference had been bankrolled by the wealthy, reactionary and
ubiquitous Olin and Bradley Foundations and that the speakers were from
the high priced academic hooker list of the National Association of
Scholars and therefore its claims to be nonpoliticized had all the
efficacy of a Philadelphia bankroll. Levitt and others orchestrated a
letter and phone call campaign, a damn sight nastier than this E-mail,
to Science magazine. As a result Katharine Livingston, an editor who had
worked for Science for 33 years was de facto forced to take early
retirement. That's tough for Livingston but after all to paraphrase
Lenny Bruce in Father Flotsky's Triumph; "You [she] knew what the gig
was when you [she] took it." What I tried to point out in earlier
E-Mails is that these here scientists get their bone from of the
Military Industrial complex (Olin=ammuntion; "The bullets?---Look in
back of my brown slacks."-for real Bruce fans only) and worse. Now Paul
Forman and Katha Pollitt have also stated the obvious. Actually, I think
their paranoid. But let's not be too quick to negatively diagnose
Pollitt; she does write some thoroughly mawkish poetry; that should
appeal!
P.S. Pollitt can be inconsistent. I'd like to draw attention to one
instance. She states that Forman is well equipped to point up the
obvious political bias in the Gross-Levitt collection because he has
"formidable credentials in the field" e.g. Physics. But physics ain't
got shit to do with it. Any chump can see through the lying, stooging
gun-for-hire hustle in the Gross/Levitt project. Forman can, Fish can, I
can; Christ, I'd wager even Henry Gould can!

Yard sales beneath me? David?

As Keats so clearly says, it is easy to speak of what a yard sale should be
but even easier to furnish your house from more than one -- and more than
one house too -- as I have done. But my favorite is to find old tube audio
equipment at yard sales. All you who wish you had turntables to play large
black vinyl music, you can find them at yard sales. Henry Taylor found
Stanzas for Irene Leszak (sp?) at a yard sale. I have a wondrous Minox
camera on a slinky chain I found at a yard sale even with its fanning out
flash umbrella and two tiny rolls of film or are they sculptures of snails?
Because yard sales are locus solus detritus, and detritus is fashion's
future the yard sale is a guidebook to the future and past at once. Early
saturday morning before the really good stuff is gone the cool bowl in the
hands of the woman who pulled up just before you, before that, the moment
you're walking up the yard and can see the weird 50's armchair in one eye
and the mixer with the other, that's when you know. Yard sale equals Eden.
I have two Harry Bertoia butterly chairs, Knoll circa 1959. One I found at
a yard sale on Waller street in 1978. You've sat in it for god's sake! The
other I found in the alley -- in the alley! -- behind my Tilden street
house in 1992. I'm telling you they're a pair. A pair, do you hear me man?

        Marty Ehrlich, Live Wood, with Erik Friedlander on Cello and Mark
Helias on bass (2 cds).  Wonderful.  Oh, and the bourbon--Knob Creek, when for
special occasions, Walker Evans (better than JD at a little more than half the

Now that I've accepted Joel's request and you have so eloquently pointed out my
 errors of perception, making me a more decent human being, perhaps you could a
ddress your continued resistance to engage the poetry of Tom Clark while smeari
ng his name on a periodic basis.  Maybe it's the person, not the poems, that up
set you.  By the way, if you're looking for proof of life in his poems, check o
ut his most recent, White Thought, published jointly by the Figures and Hard Pr
ess.  Or maybe his book on the trade of otter skin in the early 19th century wo
uld appeal to your sensibilities.  This book, published by Black Sparrow, actua
lly addresses issues of race, colonization and trade without the vanity of mora
l assumption, but with the rigor of intellectual and artistic investigition.  I
 think Tom and the Langpods share, in some way, similar impulses, though each e
xploits those to fit the design and arc of their individual lives.

Reading Ted Berrigan's lecture on writing sonnets I came across this
transcription of a Shakespeare line:  "They rightly do inherent heaven's
graces." I must admit to being a spelling snob, to the extent that I
am dismissive of opinions expressed about "Alan Ginsburg" or "Finnegan's
Wake" or "The Wasteland" or "Harry Matthews."  This is not to say I am
immune from error myself, just that the automatic pedantic reflex persists
in me.

Henry, my funny bone is slower than most, so forgiive if I'm not hip

anyway, you'll recall that _In the American Tree_, one of the

A Pothole Named Copernicus

Unfortunate it seems but true that we, though subject to mass delusions
& cravings as ever, are now no longer the same political animal, as once
could be content with parti-pris.  Not even relict culture lends
identity enough:  the only thing in all the present maelstrom that i can
find to cling to build on or huddle within, is my panic-stochastic
adoption of a to me savoury subculture.

“Subculture” isn’t quite the word.  That would imply something lesser &,
above all, acknowledged as secessionist by the parent culture.  Whereas
i maintain our glorious center has simply evaporated.  What keeps us
from noticing this simple fact are the massively concerted facades of
media sculsh, psepholatry, taxploitation, & an imperial idiom (already
on the fritz).  We think in terms of something else.  But we don’t have
a name for it yet.  Within the shells of the old divisions & sterotypes,
a new paradigm has blossomed.

Take a gander at the nearest newsstand & behold.  Wherefore (you ask)
can there ever be snagged, a quorum of Iguana Owners?  A glossy & not
negligible magazine (/website) sits there leering forth:  & i
understand, like apple-bonked Newton, that the true groups today are
DISPERSED.  Maybe they never do assemble all at once in one place.  A
force, invisible & plenipotent, still orients them, guides, like filings
of steel around one pole of a magnetic tropism.  I call it a “Blik”.

“Blik” is a way of referring to a group of people by the one quality or
predilection they all share.  This, their style-philosophy, works for
that blik the way a territory used to for tribes.  It’s a philosophy
because it involves ideas (whether or not they’re defined or even talked
about), unlike consumerist fashion;  & it’s a style-philosophy because
it involves the whole person’s lifestyle, not just a point of view.  A
blik compels you to seek expression.

What creates a blik?  Glamour.  A fascination with one specialized mode
of being in the world.  It can be a type of music, a game, a drug, a
hobby, a form of sexuality, a religion, a personality cult, a venerable
or self-invented artform, a way of making a living (rarely!); it is
anything that gives meaning to your life inexhaustibly & whose
contemplation creates a ramified discourse -- standards of a playground
for the exercise of free choice,  & a dialectical encounter with
mediated Necessity.  And because all glamours involve the manipulation
of symbolic objects (--what “magic” ever was) it is not enough to just
“talk the talk”.  We are driven to repeatedly transact whatever
magical-metaphorical operations reinforce our blixen.

They feed.

Hardly anyone lacks a blik;  most of us belong to several.  On one hand,
the system of blixen has swallowed up all the major preoccupations of
humanity-- art, religion, politics--by breaking them down into
specialities that fewer & fewer outsiders care to explore; on the other,
this system shades off into the infinitesimal subtleties & infinite
variety of “taste”.  To keep this term at all meaningful, i want to
restrict it to those things you not only care about enough to demand one
way & not another, but also have spent time discriminating & studying.
Maybe it doesn’t have a newsletter, or conventions to meet others of
your ilk at yet;  still, these are inherent tendencies--& goals:  who
will be the first Perfume Critic?  Do the Trekkies have a martyr?

We even perceive our predecessors in terms of blixen.  Just read a book
& become a Druid!  Instead of politics-history, culture-history;  each
century or (in this one) decade a congeries of fads.  I don’t know if
it’s any falser.  What morality was to the Nienteenth Century, &
Politics is to the Twentieth, Blixen will be to the Twenty First:  a
metalanguage.  No one will be able to talk about anything outside it.
Clearly, “counterculture” has no place.  That’s what they all are.

History is savagely random, but Culture is savagely dialectical.  We’re
left with the dialectics of blixen.  This does not mean nothing.  If the
Sixties succumbed to irony as much as to consumerism, we seem to be
entering, dialectically, a Post-Ironic period (i owe this term to the
Dallas poet Melanie Pruit).  Irony only has meaning against an assumed
norm; precisely what’s being contested in the current “Kulturkampf”.
Goverance being left to the Politico-Show Biz blik, that power vacuum
consequent became parasitized by sundry pirates flying the colors of the
Biblical Fascist blik (you can fill in the rest).  But two blixen far
more readily corrupt than conquer one another...Farce, Karl, this time.
The Work continues.

Subject:      The Perloff Vizpo Seminar
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Marjorie Perloff was gracious enough to send me a copy of her Official
Syllabus.  It is substantially more formidable than the one posted at
the Stanford U. website which Luigi-Bob Drake circulated, but for me
only a slight improvement.  I continue to feel that her seminar is
basically a textual poetry course focusing on a few language poets who
have used visual devices in their poetry, with a heavyweight genuine
visual poet or two like Tom Phillips thrown in for appearance's
sake--plus a massive surround of scholarly publications.  While not
particularly important in itself, Perloff's seminar is annoyingly
symptomatic of the treatment we visual poets have been subjected to in
this country for too many years.

My attitude toward it is much as I believe the attitude of any language
poet would be if visual poetry instead of langpo were the poetry vying
for acadominance with Iowa WorkShop Poetry, and I--as well-known Critic,
Professor Bob of, say, SUNY, Buffalo, its own self--made it known that I
had decided to teach a seminar on language poetry, and was having
Richard Kostelanetz, Crag Hill, Jonathan Brannen, John Byrum, Karl
Young, Carol Stetsor, Jim Leftwich, Liz Was and Harry Polkinhorn give
readings and visit the class.  I would claim that all these people have
composed poems as deft in the langpo vein as Perloff's visitors, Charles
Bernstein, Susan Howe, Kathleen Fraser, Tom Raworth, Kenneth Goldsmith,
Cole Swensen, Diane Ward, Joan Retallack, and Johanna Drucker, have in
the vizpo vein (although I have to confess that I privately consider my
group's langpo significantly better than the vizpo of Perloff's
group's).

And what if I scheduled the following classes:

Week 1 (Jan 7)  Introduction and Assignments

Week 2 (Jan 14)  The Tradition: Laurence Sterne (my equivalent of
Perloff's George Herbert.)

Week 3 (Jan 21):  Modernism: Gertrude Stein and E.E. Cummings--my
equivalents of Perloff's Apollinaire and Ezra Pound--one unarguably
appropriate, one rather strained

Week 4 (Jan. 28) A complete run of O.ARS--which, while certainly not a
definitive collection of language poetry, did as much for it as Mary
Ellen Solt's anthology of concrete (but not all cases visual) poetry did
for visual poetry

The other weeks: works by my visiting poets--and Ron Silliman and Clark
Coolidge as my equivalents of Perloff's Tom Phillips and Ian Hamilton
Finlay, and Jackson Mac Low, as my equivalent of Perloff's Jackson Mac
Low

And what if my list of required and recommended books included the
complete run of O.ARS but nothing else most people doing language poetry
in this country and Canada would consider even a tenth as close to a
central work in the field as it?  And what if, after some obscure
language poet had lodged a complaint against my list for ignoring just
about everyone he knew in the field, I provided a numbly-long
Supplementary Reading List that contained the following, among other
material:

(1) a few token references to the best US language poets (and mention of
essays by others in some book Bernstein had edited while ignoring his
poetry to parallel Perloff's mentioning two essays by others in a book
edited by Kostelanetz but not Kostelanetz's Wordworks or vast array of
other consequential writings, particularly as a critic)

(2) Karl Kempton's Black Strokes White Spaces and Crag Hill's Transforms
(with a confession that they had no language poetry in them but were
worth looking into anyway)

(3) As many books by Harry Polkinhorn as Perloff has books by Johanna
Drucker and, of course, Professor Bob's own book, Of Manywhere-at-Once
(which actually has a chapter on language poetry, at least by my
definition of it)

(4) a lot of good stuff from earlier in the century or by people outside
North America--i.e., poets and critics too distant to interfere with my
attempt re-define language poetry in this country for the 21st century

(5) Ron Johnson's Book of the Green Man, Kostelanetz's Wordworks, and
work by Spencer Selby

(6) almost nothing that wasn't published by an academic press or the
equivalent

(7) the Electronic Poetry Center (EPC)  (http://writing.upenn.edu/epc)
and the Jacket Website (which I described as the two best sites around
for language poetry) along with Karl Young's Light & Dust Website
(http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm), Miekal And's Joglars
Crossmedia Broadcast (http://www.net22.com/qazingulaza/joglars/
index.html) and QAZINGULAZA (http://net22.com/qazingulaza/index.html)
sites, and a sprinkling of sites like my own Runaway Spoon Press site
(http://www.interlog.com/~dal/rasp) that can't be said to be in the fore
of the language poetry movement but have not been wholly inhospitable to
it.

Would you be bothered, Oh, Hypothetical Language Poet?  (Assuming,
remember, that your group was as under-recognized as American and
Canadian visual poets are.)  I suspect you might be.

Postscript: some have wondered that I care what an academic like Perloff
does with visual poetry.  And I think of the contra-genteel poet Sparrow
demonstrating at the New Yorker's doors in protest of its editorial
policy regarding poetry, eventually getting a few of his poems into it.
Why should any serious poet want academic recognition, or publication in
a magazine like The NewYorker?  My answer: I more and more believe that
my function as a poet is to bring aesthetic pleasure to as much of the
world as I can--to repay all the poets who have given me pleasure.  I
thus believe that winning a public (not only for myself but for other
poets I admire) is as much of a part of being a poet as manipulating
words (and the like). This means getting academic and/or commercial
acceptance.  I don't see any way around it.

As a serious poet, I also want as many people to see my work as possible
so that I can benefit from their responses to it.  This is even more the
case with my criticism.  How can I know if what I'm doing is effective
if I keep it from all but a few?

Moreover, a grant or two could certainly come in handy.  There's nothing
wrong with wanting an occasional pat on the back, either.

Many visual poets would disagree with me about academic recognition,
grants, and the rest of it.  But I'm quite sure they share my irritation
with having an art that we've had to practice in near-total isolation
for over thirty years in some cases further obscured by a wing of langpo
that seems almost completely to miss the lyrical/metaphorical
possibilities of visual poetry, focusing instead on typography as a form
of cuing or decoration.  These others don't want the recognition of the
establishment, they just don't want to have dirt kicked at them any more
than they already have.

    Come.  We'll make carrot ginger juice and have some toast from home-made whole
wheat bread.  Some times, when I am feeling the need for a little extra kick I put
some kale with the carrots and ginger.  If you do it right it makes wonderful orange
and green layers in the glass.    Honeydew melon, apples, and ginger also makes
great juice.  (Tone in email is difficult: I'm deadly serious.)

But a creative use of tradition includes not only translation & transmission

Teaching Tom Phillips is fine; the problem, as I think my piece makes

who she is not.

Subject:      Re: French disease

Mark Wallace, in his excellent post, raises questions about the identity of
the "new".  For what it's worth, the need for the new seems to me an
expression of the mind's need & capacity for self-estrangement -- what
Raymond Williams calls "the active struggle for new consciousness through new
relationships."  Obviously, even the most difficult work will become familiar
over time.  So that the need for "radical" innovation is the result of a
crisis arising from the domesticating assimilation of previously difficult
work.  I think Silliman is probably right to regard "the French-influenced
short abstract lyric" as "the poetry of utter habit."  *But overlooked in
these posts is that the onus of habit falls perhaps even more heavily on
established writers than on emerging ones.*  And  one could or should --
despite its obvious brilliance -- fairly ask what precisely is radically
*new* about the latest installments of *The Alphabet*?

...to call to mind a song our society has elected not to let us forget.

But beneath it a less ubiquitous strain:

        For the people of that flow
        Are new, the old

        New to age as the young
        To youth

        And to their dwelling
        For which the tarred roofs

        And the stoops and doors--
        A world of stoops--
        Are petty alibi and satirical wit
        Will not serve.

I found cris cheek's message about the recent UK situation more convincing
than the claims on Ron and Don's part that the NEA provided neglible
assistance in their generation's articulation of a poetry adequate to its
situation (a situation that it would be fantasy and self-flattery to call
"revolutionary," though some of the art may have aspired to render it more
so; the only defense of a viable NEA I've ever encountered has been on
social democratic, not social revolutionary, terms, and even these have
been driven from public consideration in our epoch of only capitalism).
For Ron to pass off assistance to "some book publishers, notably The
Figures, Roof and Sun&Moon" as immaterial sounds funny to me; like saying
Duncan, Spicer, and Blaser didn't do much for the Berkeley Renaissance.  On
the other hand, I do take R & D--and Henry Gould's--point(s) that in the
grand scheme of things, other factors made more of a real difference than
the NEA.  It's just that the books remain when many other of these
conditions shift, subside, defy our hopes, etc.

Oppen's lines bring one further thing to mind.  The question of how to make
it new takes on a different urgency in an established writer, I think, and
it must be tempting to displace the crisis onto the young in the form of
surly dismissals / loving prods.  Has Ron succeeded in making it "really
new" in the years since _Ketjak_?  I've heard knowledgable contemporaries,
young and old, dispute the question pretty hotly, and the outcome is not
every time in Ron's favor.

Like other contributors to this thread, I wish there were time enough for
more, but now I've got to return to the extremely melancholy task of boxing
up for storage all those NEA-supported poetry books that mattered so
little....

That camera pulling back metaphor, are you really committed to it? It

reminded me of Michael Snow's Wavelength -- in which the camera doesn't
pull back -- it just keeps going forward -- in an impossibly slow way --
they don't make lofts like that anymore -- or murder mysteries, for that
matter --

For the record, when I was first thinking of starting Junction Press I had
a chat with James Sherry of Roof and Segue fame(whom I've known since
before there were Language Poets, and who has always been very generous to
poets and presses of all stripes, even folks like me who are sometimes
hostile to his agenda). His take on NEA grants was that if you did four
books a year the grant might cover the cost of printing one. Remember that
these are matching grants, and they aint all that big. This was before the
huge grants to a few established small presses that served to increase
their budgets while maintaining their annual losses intact.
Neither Junction nor Broadway Boogie, the mag I did in the early 70's, nor
the several long-term reading series' that I've run applied for grants.
It's all sweat equity and out-of-pocket, the latter partly restored by
sales, and as far as I know it's been ever thus. If the rules changed I
suppose I could hire someone else to typeset my book designs, but then I'd
have to learn to delegate responsibility, not one of my strong points.
What I'm getting at is whether or not you like the books it's unlikely they
were generated without a publisher's passionate committment just because he
had the wherewithal, and that committment finds a way to see books into
print regardless of the obstacles. And the NEA, although at times
marginally helpful, has been pretty much irrelevant.

Jordan:

Thanks for the questions. I will say this non-combatively: You are
too smart for me! I have heard a few times of Juliana Spahr,
but I know nothing, really, about the cinema (though I, too, loved
Starship Troopers). And I've never heard of Michael Snow or of his
movie Wavelength. I like that title, though, because it makes me
think of what I think our cyber relationship has more or less been
up until now-- not on the same wavelength. But, of course, now
that I think about it, that's probably exactly what you meant by
mentioning that movie! You see how it is? This is not easy for me.
Nor is it, I imagine, for you. (though in a different way, of
course.) Actually, is it a movie or a book?

Jordan, I guess I don't know, all in all, what the hell I was trying
to say about the cameras. Something, I suppose, that vaguely seemed
to evoke the idea of baring the device, showing the frame, which I
think Barrett Watten said once in an essay somewhere about the
influence of Robert Smithson on the early Russian futurists. And it
somehow seemed to connect, in a suggestive, "renga" sort of way, with
the young post-Language poet caught, like a frightened rabbit,
between facing mirrors. I know it was weak, but what should I say?
We're all here on this earth for such a short time together, doing
the best that we possibly can.

But actually, I think this is important too: the thing about the
cameras pulling slowly back to show the two people fornicating is
from a memory I have of a film by Goddard (or one of those 60's
French directors), and I remember being stunned by this when I saw
it, it was a truly shocking moment. Wait a second, I remember saying
outloud and spilling my soda, that's a camera! But now, of course,
most people see something like that and yawn. And their yawning is a
pity, but I suspect there's not a whole lot to be done about it.

Don't you agree? I'm trying to connect.

What _was_ that movie? I remember it was in b/w and the main
protagonist was a boy-poet of some sort in love with two women. In
one of those scenes where the camera pulls away to reveal the set
(lights, wires, cameras and all), the poet has jsut finished
copulating with one of the women he loves, but she had forgotten to
remove her tampon, so it has been pushed up far inside her. She is
quite calm about the matter, but he immediately calls a friend
on the telephone with great excitement to tell him about it. Isn't it
amazing?! he says. In the end, the two women fall in love with each
other, which French women in the movies always seem to do. Well, I
know that sounds terrible, but that's about all I can remember from
that movie. Does anyone out there know what I'm talking about?

I don't.

Kent

bill bissett reads this monday, jan. 26, at simon fraser university,
burnaby, bc, canada, at 1:30 pm, 126 halpern centre.

Jack Kerouac: You know who's a great poet? I know who the great poets are.

Ted Berrigan: Who?

Kerouac: Let's see, is it . . . William Bissette of Vancouver. An Indian
boy. Bill Bissette, or Bissonnette.

Aram Saroyan: Let's talk about Jack Kerouac.

Kerouac: He's not better than Bill Bissette, but he's very original.

(from an interview with Jack Kerouac, The Paris Review, Summer 1968)

To celebrate bill bissett's reading at SFU this Monday, January 26,
Special Collections and Rare Books has arranged a display of works by
bissett from a career in poetry that spans more than thirty-five years.
The display includes published books and broadsides featuring many
examples of the poet and artist's unique design and forming a capsulized
history of small press publishing in Canada since the mid-sixties. On
display are works published by bissett under his own long-time imprint,
blewointment press, as well as publications by Weed/Flower Press, Anansi,
See/Hear, Very Stone House, Oberon, and Talonbooks, one of bissett's
earliest publishers and his publisher of record for the past several
years. Also shown is a manuscript book of poems, drawings and collages,
"The Lion's Den and Other Poems," inscribed from bissett to Warren Tallman
and dated 1969. The three-ring binder which contains the book features a
collage by bissett on the cover. This work is part of the Warren Tallman
Manuscript Archive, and like all the other works by bill bissett on
display, is housed in Special Collections and Rare Books, Bennett Library
Room 7100. The display is in the foyer of Special Collections on the
Library's 7th floor and can be seen Monday through Friday, from 10:00 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m., from now through the month of February.

Kent:

Sorry that I can't help you with the title of the movie you're thinking
about -- it sounds great.  I was just wondering why it's a shame that
viewers today wouldn't be amazed as they were when the film came out.  I
mean, on the one hand, I can understand the sentiment -- and even share
it.  Readers/viewers shouldn't loose touch with what was
newinterestingfresh in a work from days gone by.  We should be able to
consider and appreciate how great something was in its time. On the
other hand, why?  We can never truly appreciate something in its time
because we're not there.  To see it as it was would mean being where/as
it was at its original moment -- a kind of leap back into time.  Which,
of course, we can't realy do (though certain critics would have it that
we do some such thing each time we read a work).  What I mean is, things
change.  Of course they do -- as you say, it's inevitable.  All I'm
saying is that I think not only is this change inevitable, it is in fact
desirable.  As something is re-experienced in a culture, it gains a kind
of cumulative significance, so that what was groundbreaking becomes
standard.  This, it seems to me, is the process of artistic history, and
the understanding of this cumulation of significance is an understanding
of the work within (its) history.

Just some thoughts, as I jump back onto the list after a bit of an
absence.

Hi Jordon.  Loren is an ex-Kochie, as you probably know, then slid through
here
getting an MFA without getting too scathed; a funny and smart poet as well as,
apparently, a reviewer.

fjb asked about Ben Marcus:

Yes!  I'd forgotten (until recently) about that book as well.  Saw it in a
used bookstore last summer in DC.  Too expensive, so I checked it out from
the library (then left it on the subway on my way to return it, but
confession would be digression).

So yeah, _The Age of Wire and String_ is really, as resident alien D.
Bromige would say, "a corker."  A kind of hyperspace on paper.  Delany and
Duncan play Dungeons and Dexedrine.  "Dig it," as Ben Friedlander would
say . . .

Noticed recently during a wild frenzy of re-reading that Marcus was
present for the New Co(a)st conference.  Check out his piece "Pump and
Glow" in the Technique section if'n you have it.

I didn't really associate him with the Lish crew, though.  It seemed more
"speculative" than that, but speculative by way of the present, for the
present (if that can be dug).  Also very moving, as in both soap opera and
trailer park.

I did have to start it three times, though.  The first two tries had me at
about page 20 with nowhere to want to go.  The charming time, however, saw
it catch a brainwave.  So give this book a chance, maybe a few, por
favor.

Also been very into Martha Ronk's _State of Mind_ (Sun and Moon) as of
late, and (as a latecomer, and despite the Vendler blurb) Lucie
Brock-Broido's _The Master Letters_ (Knopf, too).

Listening has consisted of the new Portishead (Sade on smack and in
traction), the AC/DC soundtrack to Maximum Overdrive (_Who Made Who_,
which I just mistyped as _Who Made Whoaaaaa_), and our own Franklin
Bruno's _A Bedroom Community_.  Oh, and also the Rolling Stones _Let it
Bleed_, because I'm teaching it to my students along with some Greil
Marcus (no relation to Ben, Marcus that is) essays, despite the fact that
Tom Mandel think his daddy (Greil's) dresses him (still Greil) funny
(which he probably does).

go cat go,

Graham

p.s. as the newest, radicalist poet on the block I propose to saw my left
arm off at my next reading (May 15th, Atticus Books, WDC!).  This reading
will also mark the premier of sections 1-98 of my new long poem, "The
Hermit's Guide to Cocktails; or, This is Not a James Tate Poem."

Bob,

    In thinking about this issue in the last week, I have come to
the conclusion that possibly it's more likely another case of
academicians following along behind (albeit only slightly in this
case) what's happening out here.  Just a glance at what's been
posted here should convince most people that vizpo is and was a
major event.  Perhaps you should take Dr. Perloff's symposium at
face value as an attempt to catch up with and study what's going
on.  In that sense she would welcome your and vizpo's input - I
have not seen any thing to contradict this.

     I think it woulod be unfortunate if your words in the last
few paragraphs of your post (quoted below) were obscured by
argument.

Interesting post on vizpo Bob, but it seems to me that the major
difference you point to is one of who is a good vizpoet (?word).
This takes it back (a step or two, I think) to frequently aired

langpo vs. something other.  I'm not interested in bringing them

        Let me say to Mark Wallace that I am neither bored nor betrayed and
whatever disappointment about the poetry scene that I might have has much more
to do with my own generation than with yours.  It's none of my business what
you or any one else might do.

        There are so many threads going, I'll take them randomly.

        1.  Ron says that the NEA supported only--what?-- The Figures, Roof,
and Sun & Moon.  Not true.  Those are the presses it supported that interested
him, and I assume that is what he means.   It supported dozens of presses, the
names of which neither of us would recognize and whose books we have never
read.  One year it also gave individual-artist grants to several Language
Poets, but that was it: they had there one panel for poets who did not trace
they pedigrees directly or indirectly to Iowa City. Language Poetry managed to
get itself identified as the alternative to the academic mainstream, and the
NEA and other granting institutions in their wisdom never heard of any one
else.

        2.  If we are placing blames, which seem to be a major activity on this
list, the sad state of poetry rests squarely on the shoulders of the poets of
my and Ron's generation. Joel Oppenheimer used to say, "If someone is twenty
and a poet, it is because s/he is twenty; if some some is forty and a poet, it
is because s/he is a poet."  If one makes it to sixty, one enters another
territory. I remember a talk that Duncan gave in the 70s  here in Albany,
looking forward to an old age in which he imagined being like Henry James.  At
any rate, it seems to me that those of us who are now forty to sixty have
failed to really establish an identity.  It is sad indeed that the easiest way
to stir up a lively discussion on this list is to make some  broad
generalization about LangPo, either positive or negative.  This is a term that
goes back twenty years.  It was introduced about the time of the first Apple
computers.  By the mid-80s (when did the L=A=N=U=A=G=E book come out?), the
documents of the movement were being archived for literary history by the
university presses.

        3.  What are the terms of this failure? If you want to stick it to us,
Mark, it is not that we are bored and betrayed.

            a.  Language Poetry made a major move in calling organicism into
question.  This was an aesthetic that belonged to romanticism and and was
renovated by the New American Poets.  That is, the New American Poets recovered
organicism from the reactionaries, Eliot and the neo-metaphysicals.  The LPs
responded: "I hate speech"; "Not the breath-line, the new sentence"; "expose
the devices"; "non-referentiality"; etc.  It would be possible, I think, to
reduce the various manifestos to a series of commandments, rather like Pound's
Imagist Manifesto--that is, plenty to support a few inventive poets to develop
an identifiable mode and to leave a mark on poetry after the mode has run from
Imagism to Amyism, but it was not sufficient to support an aesthetic in the
larger sense.  Consider what it took to get from Imagism to the full-blown
modernism that supported the work in old-age of Eliot, Pound, H.D., Willliams,
Steven, Stein, et. al. Four Quartets, Pisan Cantos, Paterson, and Trilogy are
structurally a  long ways from "The Station in the Metro."  We have not laid
the foundations for such a work, I am afraid.  There is great work being done,
but it suffers from the fact that people are going it alone (it has the problem
of what Kenner called "the home made").

            The new sentence is supple and exciting form in Ron Silliman's
hands, but as a form its rhythmic and larger formal possibilities are limited.
Watten's _Frame_, which is always intellectually inventive, is a torture
machine of short, disjunct declarative sentences: S-V-O (stop) S-V-O (stop).
The pattern so quickly burns paths in the neurons, deadening a long the way,
that a couple of pages seems to me the limit of reading.

            And across the board writing suffers from a poverty of
connectivity. I would guess that in the intellectual history of the next
century, if we manage to survive to have one, this time will be seen not as
post-structuralist but the time of triumphant structuralism.  Computers are
form and the formal invention that powers the MIT Media Lab is unprecedented.
But there is hardly a sign of this fact in the discussion of poetics.

        b.  Information.  At the time, the question of how to deal with
information became the foremost intellectual issue, poetry emptied itself out.
As an initial move in handling the information glut, that is perhaps necessary,
but an art form cannot long cut itself off from the prime intellectual issues
of its time.

        c.  Content (the larger sense of information. Knowledge).  This from a
recent news report:

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Economic growth that continued at a feverish pace in
1997 is outstripping the earth's ability to furnish resources to fuel future
growth, the Worldwatch Institute said Saturday.
"The global economy as now structured cannot continue to expand much longer if
the ecosystem on which it depends continues to deteriorate at the current
rate," Worldwatch's "State of the World" report, an annual assessment of
mankind's impact on the environment, said.
"The challenge facing the entire world is to design an economy that can satisfy
the basic needs of people everywhere without self-destructing. The enormity of
this task is matched only by its urgency," the report said.

        The only poetry that I know that attempts to face this urgency is
sentimental and hopelessly naive. Why?


            Well, that's the beginning of a response.

            Don

I've always felt the homemade is the most avant-garde.  Doesn't this
relate to your concluding paragraph on the politics of the world eco-

I tried to start answering this with my post on the rhetoric of political
poetry.  But maybe all the homemakers out there were put off by the Auden
reference. A hermetically-autonomous art form loses a feel for "urgency"
or the "form & pressure of the time" pretty quickly. There are no easy
answers, though rhetoric is the art of fluency, eloquence & persuasion.

Fair enuff, Jacques....Altho an ongoing project has a certain continuity
(or may) and we might or might not wanna use the same yardstick for it, as
for the work of someone in the early stages of finding their footing...

But....A bunch of Atlanta poets were pouring over the Philly Talks among
other items last night...And we all agreed that we couldn't make much
sense out of this French-influence claim.

Maybe you Jacques could clarify who or what is carrying out this sinister
gaullic incursion onto the current poetic scene....Maybe Ron himself...??

I think Don Byrd's long "beginning of an explanation" about his
disappointments is a wonderful and eloquent post.  I certainly asknowledge
the point about the "emptying out" of poetry (like a some cagean buddhic
mind)...But it's really exaggerated..Not invalid, but as put quite
overstated.  The politix in Silliman and Bernstein is real and intense.
Susan Howe is certainly the finest poet working today, in the U.S., for my
money.   Her nexus of historical flutter, collapse and flow, can hardly be
said to be empty..

Equally importaintly, Don: Just how were the Pisan Cantos and Paterson
less "home made" than the Alphabet, or the Crystal Text, or Melville's
Marginalia....If there's a cobbled aspect to U.S. poetry, it stretches
throughout the century (or rather, it starts with Dickenson and Whitman).

These are good points, Mark, I don't think anyone would deny them.
What I would like to ask (again!) is whether the techniques they've
chosen are the only ones available.  Obviously if you took all three
you'd have a great variety of techniques & literary & para-literary
strategies.  But what links them is a disruption & renunciation of
the clear statement, the direct approach, the traditional phrase,
rhythm, stanza, period, and obvious logic.  All well & good.
But the resulting hermeticism is understandable.

I am well aware that the tenor of my last three posts (& now I will
be quiet, folks) seems to contradict what I was saying a few days ago
about artistic integrity, Montale's "free man", etc. Montale himself
had to deal with critical attacks on his a-politicalness, his supposed
hermeticism.  Poetry walks the boundary lines.  If there's POETRY
there - somehow - it will absorb autonomy & immediacy without
losing its balance.  - Henry Gould

_The L=A=N=G=etc.etc._ Book came out in 1984. It slipped out of print for
a while then SIU press republished it last year. And as the preface by
Bernstein and Andrew points out, the first issue of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E came
out almost 20 years ago exactly: February 1978.

No they are not the only ones available...Just the ones I personally find
most urgent, vital, striking, effective, passionate....

You don't have to like 'em.  They represent one of the frames that helps
to define my own interests as a poet, reader and editor.

Other ways of writing can be quite interesting, such as your fine poem,
Reflections on a Still Life, which I published in the current Misc. Proj.
(It's gotten some very positive responses from readers not very close to
your esthetic, by the way.) But just as Howe or Coolidge are probably
always gonna remain at one remove from your central interests, so your
traditional phrase and obvious logic will remain at one remove from mine.

Agreeing to disagree can be productive.

I haven't much to say to Tom Bell's post except that for me a major
question is not who're good visual poets, who not, so much as who are
genuine visual poets, who are not; I believe many poets discussed in
Marjorie Perloff's seminar--perhaps all--deserve discussion; but not as
visual poets.  As for Perloff's welcoming input from my group, I fear
I've yet to see any genuine indication of this.

don, that was a nice post!---i take it more as an attempt to survey the
context for reception (e.g., ecological) than as a statement re aesthetics
per se... though of course "sentimental" and "naive" are/can be aesthetic
evaluations...

but your assertions carry political weight---i mean very specifically, in a
more partisan sense of the word... my understanding of what you've posted
is that you believe there may be a way for poetic practice to intervene
more directly, say, in eco-issues... i like to think so too---that is, w/o
being entirely idealistic, that the way(s) we speak and write and so forth
have a bearing on how we "make" the world, directly and indirectly and
locally (and i'm heedful of that "we")... and i'm certain you don't mean to
say that we should all start writing (as some have) about our love of
rivers and stars and such (not that i have anything against rivers and
stars and such---i'd like to spend more time with same!)...

of course this would suggest attending to certain "empirical" realities, or
realities so defined, no?... i am aware of your predilection for moving in
directions scientific-technological, and you are aware of mine (and i know,
too, that carlo lurks hereabouts!)... but i guess i'm asking how you think
contemporary poetic issues might best be situated in light of those
realities that you find most pressing?...

i don't think this reduces to "an" aesthetic, or "a" poetic... but i think
multiple aesthetix/poetix can be aligned, or practiced, wrt pressing issues
(say---though there are many who would object)... after listening to
marjorie p last night (here in chicago to discuss, brilliantly, the poetry
of frank o'hara wrt the painting of jasper johns) it's also abundantly
clear to me that the present moment's understanding of the present moment
is hopelessly incomplete---distance brings its own rewards... but i'd
greatly appreciate it, as i think others might, if you would hazard a guess
or two about what you find to be hopeful directions, b/c it *does* seem
that you find 'what's goin' on' to be, not uninspired, but ineffective...
and while this may comprise a mood (if you will) out of which to write, it
may not be sufficient to connecting---however...

best,

joe

recommendations for book-length (from 90
- 300 pp), non-vanity poetry publishers?
I have an epic and some other works and am
extending my market research beyond LMP.
I would consider both print and electronic/web
publishers.  If anyone knows of an agent who
would consider poetry (I know most do not),
I would appreciate that information as well.
Thank you in advance.

Hello, Don:

Thanks for that post; wow. A response, including a few hairs & heirs to split:

It was actually the Canadian poet Victor Coleman who first said, in print,
"SPEECH SUCKS," a poem with that title written circa 1967, 1969, which appeared
as the title poem in a collection very early in the 70s. 1969 also saw John
Perrault's (sp.?) LUCKY, a language-as-written-thing collection I've never seen
mentioned by anyone, despite publisher Kulchur's highly visible presence
throughout the 60s & early 70s. I think the New American Poets as speech-based
recoverers of organicism isn't quite the case-in-full. Whalen--who generously
gave his volumes of Stein to Coolidge when he was through with them--shifts
from (more-or-less) "written talk" to (more-or-less) "written thought,"
mid-sixties. Olson hardly spoke for everyone. Wieners's BEHIND THE STATE
CAPITOL, published mid-70s (the writing itself, I think, covering several
earlier years, possibly back into the 60s), though filled with richly sonorous
poetry, is also filled with non-verbalizable ("purely" visual) experiments with
typography--not to mention lots of collaged things from newspapers, magazines,
& Wieners's own photos. There is a sense I get, reading this consciously W R I
T T E N book from cover-to-cover, of not mental breakdown (the usual dismissal
of the work), but of spoken language being corroded by & in the act of being
written down. Which is not to favor the spoken over the written, but to suggest
an attention to organicism, to speaking and to writing, to the relationship
between these that goes beyond the naive and/or sentimental. Much of the book
foregrounds language, exposes the devices, and is non- or at least
difficultly-referential. Two subsequent volumes of work in this vein were
supposed to appear--but Wieners reportedly shoved pages of these manuscripts
beneath car tires in Cambridge one rainy night in response to the lack of
response to BEHIND THE STATE CAPITOL. This act suggests that Wieners's
intention with the book was overtly PUBLIC, & his destruction of other work
written this period & in this vein suggests a perceived failure--he was, in my
opinion, too hasty, impatient; BEHIND THE STATE CAPITOL being THE book I, & a
number of my poet friends, return to most often when considerations relative to
"how to proceed" arise. Wieners is a poet, not an art historian, but my sense
is that he was, then, aware of the contemporary landscape, & had fairly clear
ideas as to the consequences of certain shifts. He had been, after all,
institutionalized, & had his own "organicism" if you will, brutalized by--what
else to call it--"a collective mind." (Mob mentality, prejudice, notions of
"correct behavior," etc.) The title, BEHIND THE STATE CAPITOL, suggests, if
nothing else, his "position." All this to say, I don't see your "going it
alone" or Kenner's "home made" as negatives. The shiftings you point to were
initially prodded by individuals, not groups. This is not romanticism, but a
cold, studied look at the activity, the collective activity, of the human race,
& of its consequences. I'd really like to invite you to backchannel me your
address so I can send you Daniel Davidson's extension of this project (Dan knew
Wieners's work well, though he never wrote publicly about it), CULTURE. This
book-in-manuscript absolutely faces the present situation, as you describe it,
& does so with intelligence & wit, having been as coldly considered as it was
passionately made manifest. There are other writings along these lines, by
others, I can send you--none of which has yet surfaced very publicly.

Anyway--I hope the above, hair-splitting aside, suggests more essential
agreement than argument with what you say. Your post was the most compelling
I've personally seen on this list. Thanks for taking the time to do it.

Yours,

Gary Sullivan

        In Strangers on a Train, in the famous carousel scene, Hitchcock
has the camera moving back on a dolly rail while at the same time zooming
"forward"--
        (the film was made in I believe 1953--Raymond Chanlder worked on
the screenplay--)
        "baring the device"--among the first and still the best films ever
done on this were made in the 1920's--Man with a Movie Camera by Dziga
Vertov and The Cameraman by Bustweer Keaton, in Hollywood--
        there was a famous double issue of Cahiers du Cinema
in the late 1960s on Russian cinema, poetry, etc, their
interelationships-a lot of it on Vertov--just as Godard was beginning to
get interested iin "Kino Eye" writings by Vertov, which had a great
influence at the time--(forty years after their appearance in Russia--)
        not long after was the huge "Moscou-Paris" show in Paris, of
Futurism, Constructivism, Suprematism, etc
        that Cahiers issue includes the famous photo of Mayakovsky,
Pasternak and
Osip and Lili Brik together--staring down the camera--
        btw, Kent--it was not Smithson who influenced the Russians, but
the other way around--expecially Malevich has a large effect on him--see
the essay "Sedimentations of the Mind:  Earth Projects"
        Smithson notes as well that  the work of Edgar Allen Poe's in
Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym should be considered--as art criticm
appropriate to Smithson's Earth Projects--
        (See John Irwin's great book dealing in large part with this work
of Poe's, American Hieroglyphs:  The Egyptian Hieroglyphs in the American
Renaissance  John Hopkins UP, I think 1979)
        --if you think about it, a good deal of Poe's work is about baring
devices/conceling devices/revealing devices, in a dizzying hall of
mirrors--
        which mirrors show frequently in various of Smithson's projects of
the Sixties--including the one in which the mirrors cancel out, so that
the "spectator/actor" stadning the in the mirror chamber
becomes--invisible!

        "A language is therefore on the hither side of Literature. Style
is almost beyond it: imagery, delivery, vocabulary spring from the body
and the past of the writer and gradually become the very reflexes of his
art. Thus under the name of style a self-sufficient
language is evolved which has its roots only in the depths of the
author's personal and secret mythology, that subnature of expression
where the first coition of words and things takes place, where once and
for all the great verbal themes of his existence come to be installed.
Whatever its sophistication, style has always something crude about it:
it is form with no clear destination, the product of a thrust, not an
intention, and, as it were, a vertical and lonely dimension of thought.
Its frame of reference is biological or biographical, not historical; it
is the writer's 'thing', his glory and his prison, it is his solitude..."
(Barthes, Writing Degree Zero)

Who wants to be original--alone?
Can (an implicitly stylized) writing ever take the form of a contract
between the writer and the reader? Is this what you are asking for, Dale?

Dave:

interesting post. But given your response and the equally nice one
from Robert Zamsky, it seems the lost tampon has been taken much more
literally than I intended it to be taken. Tongue in cheek, for the
greater part, heavy on the irony, even if only comprehensible to
myself. And I've done quite a bit of my own looking into Smithson and
also the Russians, so I'm aware of the chronology. Chronology has
been such a preoccupation on the list of late.

But then, how do we really _know_ that Malevich (who swore by such
things) didn't travel forward (like a camera, in an impossibly slow
way) to stand somewhere in Passaic inside one of Smithson's Mirror
Displacements, witness the concept of his vanishing, and then *poof*
reappear back in Moscow, to create the works that later came to
influence Smithson's mirror displacements? Time coils in on itself and
then slowly sinks back into a dead lake. As Jordan Davis might put it
in his marvellously laconic way:  you never know.

Hurrah for Malevich.

Hurrah for Smithson.

and Hurrah, above all, for Poe, wiht whom I shared opium one magical
afternoon by the Milwaukee River in 1996 (it was lightly snowing). I
will not soon forget his parting words of warning, nor his raven form,
slowly flapping east toward Baltimore, where he would come to write
Pym and then die, misunderstood, rabid, alone.

Kent

bob g.-
        as you have known i have been running a press publishing visual
and experimental work for the past 5 years (tailspin press), and i have
often wondered why it is that people like perloff or drucker are turned
to by the world at large for a glimpse of visual and spatial poetics
rather than you or bob cobbing or john bennett or ihf or cris cheek or
jurgen olbrich or even people like dick higgins or kostelanetz or ono
madeline gins or alice hutchins or george brecht or ian breakwell for
opines about visual work, and i have largely come to 2 conch lose ions.
1, for the most part visually and spatially weird work tends to have a
very small circulation outside of special collections, archives, and
personal networks (one of the reasons i am here at buffalo is the
collection at the rare books room under bob bertholf and mike basinski),
and as a consequence people who are outside of the loo p only see what
they want to see, or rather what they can see easily, and not what nec
goes on in our rather insular world. So, books by drucker about artists
books  (for instance) carry a great deal of weight because they are
highly vissible even though they are pollitically motivated to only
4ground one-of-a-kinds (which are completely un-attainable by most
standards and thus she can say whatever she wants about them with
realtive impunity)or works comming out of granary (her publisher who also
makes the books almost completely una4dably expensive) and largely ignors
small press visual/art book/objects. on the other hand perloff's seminar
is doing what many of her books do, specifically taking a largely unheard
of genre (at least in terms of accademic writing) and giving it a rather
shallow reading, distilling a group of pallitable (for main-stream
accademic and poetry audiences) practitioners, and presenting them as the
end-all-be-all of the field. one of her modes is to show that otherwise
acclaimed poets are doing this odd quirky thing too, thus giving credence
to her judging this "new" field of research worth partaking. what her
work does is expose people to experiment, but in a very conservative and
often empty way missing many or even all of the high points and showing
only tame and watered down art. i'm not sure what my second reason was.

From the perspective of the present day the development of LangPo from the
most radical innovations of the New Americans seems inevitable.  But this
inevitability is  imaginary & Gary Sullivan's remarks about looking to
Wieners -- I, myself, would cite Ceravolo just as readily -- "when
considerations relative to how to proceed arise" seems extremely suggestive.
 Perhaps one way to proceed is to consider -- to re-imagine -- what different
lines of development New American writing might have taken in moving away
from referentiality other than those exploited by LangPo.

Hurrah for Gary Sullivan's fascinating post on Wieners, et.al.

And Hurrah for his stunning revelation, which casts everything in a
sudden new light: that the fruit-laden tree of American Language
poetry has its beginnings in an epochal short poem that is
plagiarized out of Canada.

Or would that be partly to the whole point?

Katy, you are right, and I do apologize to the list for contributing

        It's hard to keep up lately -- did all these various and
variously interesting posts about the new vis-a-vis langpo really start
when David Bromige asked, innocently enough, if the list (January '98)
were pro- or anti- langpo? Did David ever really answer my response to
him last week before Dale (and, to a lesser extent, Henry) picked up the
ball? I wonder what percentage of time people actually SPEND on the list
-- an hour a day? More? This is the first chance I've had to respond to
things in a week, other than furtive back-channels . . .

        Anyway, a few thoughts about:
        1) Langpo. Yes, I agree it's sad when people feel they have to
make "large general statements," the distaste for which I suppose begat
Dale's readings of the Watten stanza followed by alternate readings by
cris and David and Joel. My question about that mini-thread is: when did
a poem's capacity to generate multiple interpretations become something
of value? Aren't we really going back to _Seven Types of Ambiguity_
here?

         I noticed that Ron Silliman, in an essay I generally admired in
_ILS_ #4, had some kind words about the new critics, saying that their
"reactionary aesthetic and political worldview" was the only thing
really at issue; for many of us, though, the whole project of new
criticism was fundamentally unsound (perhaps for reasons of
"organicism") and langpo's early resemblance to that project generated
suspicion. In the same issue, he says "an issue that continually lurks
near the surface (and also near the heart) of almost all language
writing is an ambivalence of intention, of intentionality as such."
Well, call me a philistine, but I'm a little tired of "texts" that
demand such response -- they become too much of an intellectual parlor
game and such practice reduces the poem to the level of a jigsaw puzzle.
When I think of what I VALUE in poetry, I think of information (and not
solely in terms of Don Byrd's valuable example of such); I think of the
skillful demolition of linguistic habit, the "dead, stinking dead,
usages of the past"; I think of music; I think of truth and beauty; but
I never, NEVER think "gee I like this because I think it means one thing
but other people might think it means another." (I thought of this while
listening to the news last night and hearing "suborning of perjury is
difficult to prove because conversations are abstract -- it's difficult
to say what they mean" And if CONVERSATIONS are abstract . . .)

        So for me there's something attractive about what Henry calls
the poetry of plain statement (forgive me Henry if that's not exactly
what you said). Is there anyone on this list who doesn't REVERE early
Auden? As another example (and in answer to a request by David Bromige)
here's some stanzas from a long poem by Tom Clark, "Early Warning":

        43
        Driven together by a desire to contend
        Knowing no life but that of rivalry
        They continued to buy and sell each other's souls
        Even in this enclave of fugitives
        Though allegedly they were dedicated to poetry
        Instead it was envy that motivated them
        So that they resembled rabid dogs
        Traveling in a pack with maximum infighting
        The attention of the group turned instantly to any
        Renegade who threatened to outdistance
        The rest, and this outlaw was collectively attacked

        44
        Mutual reinforcement's the name of the game
        to survive in the "arts" you've got to be a belonger
        if not to a school, then to a club,
        a cell, a lodge, a party, a police force,
        only the party standard bearers
        are awarded the laurels of the party
        all non-belongers are branded "paranoid" --
        distrustful, dangerously suspicious (i.e., wise
        to the condition of being outsiders); I'm
        (for instance) as ingenuous and naively trusting
        as your average Sudanese mercenary killer.

        45
        There is no interpretation necessary.
        You got to deal with the man the way
        the man going to deal with you. No hate
        but to relate to history not forgetting
        the mistake of those who'd evade it. Sticks
        and stones will certainly break my brittle
        bones but the stunted drone of the many
        poetry clones only makes me laugh and study
        ways to gain a new power over words
        that are so stubborn, to steer them into
        clear and simple sentences is a good lifetime's work.

        Qualifications positively leap to the fore. I'm not claiming
this is one of Tom's best works; what I'm saying is that, for me, the
lack of necessity to "interpret" is sometimes a pleasure in and of
itself.

        2) The New. I think that the question "Is Ron's alphabet
sequence really new?" is an ultimately degrading question. Shouldn't we
be asking instead "is it GOOD?" People on this list have called it
brilliant but still question its "newness" pedigree: this seems absurd!
Granted, one's relation to The Tradition can be transgressive -- it's
nice to assume that one would have been right there with Wordsworth and
Coleridge in the _Lyrical Ballads_ speaking the real language of men,
that one wouldn't have been among the Georgian poets Pound held up to
scorn in the Imagist Manifesto; as frequently stated in another context,
history is written by the winners. But for me, the anxiety of
determining if one's work is "truly, truly new" is academic in the worst
sense. That way lies fetishism. And again, it focuses attention (only)
on the material text rather than the world and its complicated and
complicating political environment that may have generated that text,
the environment we all return to with hopefully-freshened senses and new
understanding once we pick our eyes off the page.

        Jacques Debrot wrote not long ago about the "the mind's need and
capacity for self-estrangement." Sorry, but it's all I can do not to
feel estranged, and I don't think I'd turn to poetry first if I truly
wanted to feel such. Much too long a post; my apologies to all for that.

Whew, Bill, glad to hear from someone more or less agreeing with me!
Ironically, you also embarrassed me because I haven't mentioned your
press in any of my posts and should have.  Yes, your take is close to
mine.  And I even have some sympathy for Perloff and Drucker's
narrowness as I recognize--always have recognized--how much there is in
our little field alone that I'm unaware of, and I do try to search it
out.  I don't think Perloff and Drucker have yet.

critical theory fer sure, but itself mostly shows a little bit o
biographical in its historical, no?  - ie, whats the diff?
and if ones/my style is that detachable unit from ones/my content
(read: the part with a 'destination', 'intention')  isnt most everyone
original alone ? hence, what make 'n model of solitude ? no one seems to

Hi folks,

Soon after the death of the expatriate American composer Conlon Nancarrow
this past summer, several folks on the list were looking for more
information on Nacarrow's relationship with George & Mary Oppen during
their stay in Mexico City (this had been brought up in an exchange in the
Village Voice between Jackson Mac Low & Kyle Gann, following Gann's obit
column).

tracked down some additional information on this from Charles Amirkhanian,
an SF Bay area composer/text-sound artist/radio producer etc., hope someone
finds it to be useful:

Seems to me that langpo was a crystallization of certain tendencies in
the air at the time, most of which had been going on for some time.
e.g., I first met Bruce Andrews in 1970, at Michael Lally's house, when
Bruce was getting his MA at Hopkins and I was in 11th grade.  Michael had
found out about Bruce because a work of Bruce's was published (by Tom
Clark!) in the Paris Review.  It seemed to Michael and myself (and no
doubt to Tom Clark) as entirely within the second generation NY school
tradition, although Bruce had a much harder edge in terms of what he
liked and disliked among contemporaries' writing.

From the NY perspective (I have no idea about SF) it was probably the
fortuitious simultaneous presence of Bruce and Charles B in NY mid-70s,
plus (as I recollect it) the strong interest of James Sherry, who
published alot of proto-language works in ROOF.

There is a distance between what Bob Grenier was writing and what Larry
Fagin was writing, but at the time it seemed as though the main
distinction was that Larry employed much more sophomoric humor.

What went away or was buried, in NY at least, by langpo, was not Iowa
Famous Writers School, but writers like Charles North, Paul Violi, etc.
Ann Lauterbach, John Yau, Tony Towle also come to mind.  Not that these
poets were ignored or disappeared or whatever, but that the limited
critical attention available went towards langpo.  My own theory,
expressed in my earlier post after reading Mailer's Ancient Evenings, is
that langpo was a period style, it could represent other things going on
in the politics and culture of the time, and could focus attention that
way.  Also, langpo was extremely commodious (catholic?) in accepting
ancestors, whether or not it was as open to contemporaries or acolytes
(re somebody's post about cliqueishness in San Francisco).

From a great height, nobody will able to tell any of it apart.

To plunge further, Barrett Watten's writing when I first read it seemed
equally mainstream post NY school (Bolinas branch), albeit with a much
drier humor than, e.g., Bill Berkson.

And another thing.  Poetry is not political anymore because poetry has
moved from being "Great Tradition" to "Little Tradition" in Redfield's
distinction.

I'm going to have some breakfast now.

Subject:      fri. night Poetry Wars

A ways back in our current keyboard handball game(s) I mumbled something
about language poetry being about the difference between presence & ink,
text & voice.  A playing-up of the difference, based on a reaction to the
shell game of identity-voice-presence-naturalistic-organicism.  This
particular post is not pro or contra anything.  I just want to suggest
2 things: 1) maybe Vico was right: writing, text, MAY AS WELL pre-date
speech because speech BEGAN as gesture,"drawing". Ut pictura poesis.  So
that perhaps there is a synthetic view rather than a binary or trinary
view to be had of gesture (performance), voice (speech), and writing (drawing).
Which leads me to 2): every ORGANIZED artistic move (vorticism, language
poetry, what have you) is, as Gary Sullivan suggested, a latecomer -
since THE ORIGINAL WORK OF ART IS SELF-GENERATING, SELF-OVERDETERMINED,
INSPIRED, SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL, EXTRAORDINARY-ORDER-CREATING - beyond
the "plan" of the artist - & why?  BECAUSE IT IS AN ULTRA-CORRELATED
SYNTHESIS OF MANY INCHOATE BUT TELEOLOGICAL IMPULSES.  It's not the
artist's to command (viz. Keats as mentioned...).  So a synthetic poetics
would ENCOURAGE those syntheses.  And recognize when they are losing
momentum through mechanical organization or uninspired repetition.
I think the flow of several threads hereabouts tends in such a direction.
And so we backfile & catalog what has perhaps been obvious for some time...

I guess I'd have about the same criticisms of it as I do of Perloff's
seminar--except that he's obviously only briefly surveying the use of
visuality, mostly peripheral visuality, in textual poetry, not devoting
an entire course to visual poetry.  Hence, he's not as loudly NOT
discussing "my crowd" as Perloff is.  So, a minor symptom of the same
disease I consider Perloff's seminar to be a larger symptom of.

Both George and Mary Oppen talked to me about Nancarrow in our conversations
from 1968 until George's death. What Charles Amirkhanian said is true,
although there are more stories...  I am amazed at the 'subjects' that come
up on The List, not to mention the responses (flow of heat). Is there
something you, Herb, are after here?

i think there's a distinction to be made, between the art on th one
hand (self-generating etc, ok) and the artist(s)/social context...
a vital artistic movement seems to me (praps somewhat idealized) a
number of folks who find themselves mining a similar vein ov exploration,
sharing experience, learning & building on each others success/failures.
& that's to be contrasted w/ less-than-vital Organized Movements, late-
comers & wannabes, yr "mechanical organization or uninspired repetition..."

there've been plenty of examples of folks continuing to do ORIGINAL
WORK thru these threads; but i think the debatespark frm ron s. was
a bemoanment about th lack "crystallization" of commonallity among
those individs?  or a lack of articulation of common ground...
would you say, henry, that such an crystalization/articulation might
(eventually? inevitably?) lead to the mechanical org & unispired rep
that you deplore?  but it also adds some Weight (cultural capital=81)--
lack ov which (for some Unorganized & therefore Unrecognized Underdogs)
has also been cause fr recent wailing...

Early in the vizpo debate I felt some sympathy for poor ole neglected
Bob Grumman and his cohorts in the "Oh no not more pomo" vizpo biz. But
after some thinking, and watching his attacks on well-meaning academic
critics and sympathetic and supportive people such as Charles B, I have
come to think differently. It is time that Bob stop complaining and
start offering an alternative. And if Bill Howe thinks that Marjorie P's
and J. Drucker's readings of visuality are so "superficial" (and one
might assume that by extension he thinks this of Bernstein as well),
then I for one am dying to get schooled in what's so great about
Grumman's "crowd."  And that all it seems to be to me. Sure, they're
neglected. But there are hundreds, if not thousands, of worthy yet
neglected writers out there. Mike Baskinski, who may be part of this
"crowd" of vizpo biz champions, isn't any less a newcomer to the field
than  Bernstein's who's "Veil" is a "visual" work published in the late
seventies (I think 78) by Miekal And's press Xexoxial (sp?) editions.
Mike is someone I have published at least three times with Meow Press,
and I even did a short story by his daughter Natalie, who is an upcoming
artist and writer at 12. Mike isn't so neglected as the stink here would
have one think. I would love to hear what makes this group "genuine"
visual poets and which excludes only the "successful" language poets as
being dabblers.

It seems to be a proper use of this list-space would be to offer up
readings and descriptions of such work that is valued and yet may not
have achieved proper recognition. Unlike many of the people Grumman is
complaining about, both he and Miekal And, among others, are among the
vanguard of artists making use of web publishing as a viable means of
getting the word out. If it isn't about achieving "acadominance" (and
I'm not sure that isn't the goal) but instead, about becoming known,
appreciated, etc., then what better venue than the web for doing that?
Since when does having a book mean anything except a warm feeling in
your tummy when you sip your afternoon tea...There are plenty of unread
books out there. I still think it is about status and sociality, which
to me is a terrybull figment of the imagination best done away with. 20
people in a seminar in Palo Alto doesn't constitute an audience. And
from what I understand about that program, it isn't as if that group of
grad students is going to help sell the rights to Bob Grumman to Disney
et al. I wonder how many of them are even on this list, or how many of
them even care about the material under discussion. I think Perloff's
doing a great service by even bothering with what often seems to me a
lame and superficial medium to begin with (And I have done my share of
visual work, by the way). And as far as Drucker being superficial, Bill,
or any of the vizpobiz boys, please give me an explanation as to why THE
VISIBLE WORD might be seen as "superficial"??

   Someone brought up the "New Critics" and the way we can see them
   as similar to the "langpo"---
   Well, what do you think of Todd Gitlin's assertion that the "beats"
   also share this....
   "Their clubbiness echoed the general withdrawal from political
    activity; echoed the New Critics' strategy for extracting the
    literary text from historical context; echoed the do-it-yourself
    movement, which sent husbands into their basements to muster the
    small autarkies of leisure time; echoed, overall, the American
    infatuation with private strategems for social troubles."
    But then he adds that "among the well-known Beats, Allen Ginsberg
    was exceptional in skating along the radical edge.....Thus, when
    the zeitgesit shifted direction, retreat passed out of style, and
    other beats grew steadily more forlorn, Ginsberg could make the
    transit into the political sixties with grace....."(pg. 51).

   In a related story, the Bernadette Mayer interview in latest
    St. MArx newsletter is interesting: she attacks doctors,
    monogamy, talks of her utopia, lizard, and the lack of sex in
    the poetry scene comparitively today (among other things--like
    langpo). Good to see a poet still offering lifestyle challenges
    rather than simply aesthetic......

I was wondering when I (and the other "vizpobiz boys" out there like
Bill Howe) would be properly chopped up by someone on the other side of
this question.  I'm sorry it had to be Joel Kuszai who decided to be the
hatchet man, as I've admired what he's done with Meow Press and
elsewhere.

In response I note that Joel went on the offensive, attacking me and my
group rather than responding to my mock language poetry seminar and
showing how it failed properly to parallel Perloff's seminar.  For
instance, is Charles Bernstein really more of paragon of visual poetry
than Richard Kostelanetz is of language poetry?

He asks me to offer an alternative.  I'm not sure what he means, but I
think I've shown what I'd like: more recognition for the visual poets I
consider undeservedly disregarded.  That would mean, mainly, a proper
anthology of current visual poetry; visual poetry seminars that at least
mention more than one or two of the group I'm pushing; critical volumes
on the visual in poetry that don't prove their superficiality by
bypassing almost everyone of importance in the field, and so forth.  I
might add that I have myself tried to provide an alternative over the
years with my Runaway Spoon Press and the few writings on the field that
I've been able to get into literary publications.

If Joel is really "dying to get schooled in what's so great" about
my "crowd," I suggest he read some of the essays on visual poetry at the
Light & Dust Site.  He might even take a look at my book Of Manywhere-
at-Once, a copy of which is at the SUNY, Buffalo, library.  I also have
a pertinent essay or two at my Comprepoetica site.  Better, he might
just examine back issues of Industrial Sabotage, Xerolage, Score,
Atticus Review and other publications of extremely small circulation
that I expect he can find at that library, as well, and see for himself
what "my crowd" has done.

I don't have time to argue the merits of Charles Bernstein's use of the
visual in his work here.  I admit that I am not familiar with his
"Veil"--though I probably thumbed through a copy the one time I was able
to visit Miekal's vizpobiz corporation in Wisconsin.  I wonder, though,
if it really did more than Mallarme's pre-visual kind of poetry.  Even
if I were proved all wrong about Bernstein as a visual poet, though, my
original position would remain the same: with so many excellent but
unrecognized visual poets around, why use a seminar supposedly covering
visual poetry to push a near-celebrity in poetry like Bernstein instead
of much-less-recognized visual poets like Karl Kempton or Harry
Polkinhorn or Jake Berry--etc.?  And why make the focus of such a
seminar language poets who make some use of visual devices when you can
have visual poets who use visual devices to a much greater--and
visually-significant--extent?

Some of Joel's other comments are plain silly, like the one about my
implicitly hoping one of the grad students in Perloff's seminar might
sell the rights to something of mine to Disney.  But if ONE person
realized through her seminar what was really out there in vizpo, it'd be
wonderful!

Hurrah to J. Kuszai for pointing out how often complaints about lack of
literary recognition are actually crankiness over a perceived lack of
status--

and hurrah to him for noting that status "is a terrybull figment of the
imagination best done away with. 20 people in a seminar in Palo Alto
doesn't constitute an audience."

That aside, I wonder what the prevailing feeling is re: the web vs. the
book as a means for getting the poetic word out?

Is it possible that the generational anxiety vis a vis
Language writing expressed by Mark Wallace, Steve Evans, and other
impressively smart writers is the logical and inevitable result of
younger poets trying to be "new" through an overly narrow reliance on
_method_? While I ask this question tentatively (because I am not
exactly steeped in the young turk critics), my sense from
perusing the discussion is that this could be at the heart of the
"problem".

How so? Young "post-Language" poets, like those represented in the
anthology of Joseph Donohue, Ed Foster, and Leonard Schwartz (I'm
sorry, I presently can't recall the title), are certainly wonderfully
various and talented, and many of them will go on to be widely
published and successful. But insofar as that young group (despite
protestations) seems increasingly to Language writing as
the Key Club is to Kiwanis, might it be due to this: that the horizon
of poetic "experiment" and "originality" for this generational group
is delimited by a deeply-ingrained set of institutional laws and
protocols which (subliminally, for the most part) reduce and relegate
aesthetic resistance to the printed page, that is, to strictly
compositional method? The Key Club, to put it another way, puts
itself in the position of polishing, tweaking, and refining
paratactic, asyndetic, and juxtapositional frames of expression
without any apparent thought to a sustained exploration of
_conceptual displacements_ of institutionalized categories of
authorship and the circulation of works.

This is sort of what I meant in my Hurrah post with my perhaps unfair
reference to the young post-Language poet with conference name tag
caught between two mirrors. It's also what I menat by my reference to
Smithson's conceptualism, which is so powerful because it is at least
a provisional move beyond--and "laying bare" of--the "museum." The
Key Club, you might say, is still on guided tour inside the museum.

That's incredibly presumptuous of me to say, of course, and I'm sure
the comment will be met with contemptuous silence, or, worse yet,
by laconic and insouciant riposte with irony so subtle as to
make the spring, at long last, go out of my rubber. But Hurrah for
me, anyway, for being reckless and brash within the parameters of my
own personal weaknesses and limitations!

*[But Aha!, someone out there is saying. There _is_ an obvious
weakness and limitation in your "argument" --an argument which
clearly attempts to make up for its theoretical thinnesses through
transparent rhetorical affectations that are the marks of a latecomer
trying to ingratiate himself with powerful poets like David Bromige:
For didn't you say (says the person who said Aha) that "Robert
Smithson" succeeded in moving outside the museum? In other words,
didn't Robert Smithson attribute his works to "Robert Smithson"? So
why shouldn't _we_ sign too?]*

*[Good question, Jordan. But you see, I said "provisional". Robert
Smithson's work, though his example still shimmers and glows
like a jagged frag from the Roswell ship, has been slowly sucked,
through the keyhole of his own name, back into the museum. In fact,
beauty of beauties, there is even something now called "The Estate of
Robert Smithson." This is why.]*

OK, now many of you know that I am involved in an infamous work that
deals at least implicitly with some of these questions, so allow me
to elaborate on what I mean above through the following quote from
an interview where some of these matters are tentatively discussed.
And I promise, promise, that I will never, never raise the issue of
Araki Yasusada on this list again, unless someone else specifically
asks me to, and I'm pretty sure that that won't happen, so don't
worry. OK? OK.

Here's the "quote", slightly revised and expanded for my purposes
here:

"To what extent are the mechanisms of the 'poetry institution'
unconsciously inscribed in the "scandal" the Yasusada has provoked?
There is, after all, a very hierarchical market relationship in
American poetry, involving publishers, jobs, grants, writing
retreats, reading circuits, gossip mills, social events, and so on.
All of this is not incidental to the writing and its circulation and
evaluation, but the very matrix within which it takes place. In
short, it determines, in all sorts of subliminal ways, what counts as
good. And the keystone of it all is the function of authorship.
Isn't it obvious that without secure, self-centered names to attach
to works that the whole institutional edifice touched on above would
simply collapse? The Yasusada writings stand, on one level, as a tiny
retort to this current order of business--a business which
operates as much in the circles of the 'avant-garde' as it does in
the 'academy.' The author function is the ideological linchpin that
theory has identified, but which 'avant-garde' oppositional creative
practice has not yet imagined taking on."

I don't in any way mean that heteronymous gestures like Yasusada are
the only path leading out of the museum. To the contrary, Yasusada is
quite tentative, awkward, and pathetic in a number of ways, even
perhaps, in the current climate, self-defeating. Nor do I necessarily
mean that poets everywhere should no longer attribute
their personal names to their works. It is inevitable that the great
majority always will. What I'm talking about is a true lack of
iconoclastic, _conceptual_ panache in new writing. What I'm saying,
and to put it in an old fashioned way, is this: as long as the
institutionalized mode of authorial production goes uninvestigated
and unchallenged within the 'avant-garde' community itself, the
poetic relations of circulation, value, and exchange within it will
not be qualitatively transformed. The Key Club will always be the Key
Club.

[Interjection: I am sounding very unreasonable to most of you right
now:  i.e., Can this idiot _really_ be saying that we shouldn't take
credit for our own poems?]

The challenge, it seems to me, is pretty broad, full of multiple,
unforseen possibilities of experiment ("Alan Sondheim," in his
manifold incarnations and disseminations through electric space is
one exciting example), and it is a challenge that the Language
movement itself opened up with its insistent critiques of the "self"
and the "I". (Now, of course, all that seems effectively dead for
that older group: witness, for ironic example, the last issue of
Aerial, which carries on its spine the largest font-size personal
name in the history of poetry.)

Is what I'm saying (or trying to say) utopian in the extreme? Yes. Is
it unrealizable as wide-open option for individual and collective
imaginative praxis? No. Let me end this mother of long posts with the
following observation: Along with Smithson the other day, I invoked
the Russians, and they are the ones to look to here. Thinkers and
poets like Mikhail Epstein, Dmitri Prigov, Alexei Parschikov, Yakov
Abramov, Ivan Solovyov, and others, have been seriously working for
some time in investigating the creative possibilities of what Epstein
has called "hyperauthorship", not at all taking for granted the
unwritten law of the name. Post-Language poets reflecting on
their position and status should check them out. The promise of
cross-cultural 'avant-garde' exchange evoked by the book _Leningrad_
need not only be limited to those who have secured their individual
names in the canon by proclaiming with sophistication that the "I"
and the "self" is a construction of language.

Leave them behind, young poets, to roll in the deodorized aromas of

Bob, I'm sorry that you're sorry that I had to decide to be hatchet man on this
job. But, I'm also sure that you know how it feels when it is patently obvious
that there is a job that needs to be done. In the absence of a few good men and
women to accomplish such a job, one must undertake the activity oneself. And yes,
I don't want to be misunderstood on a few accounts here, for while I don't mind
being misunderstood most of the time, I don't want you to think that I haven't
appreciated, applauded and admired your work with Runaway Spoon, and the like. So
kudos to you--your press gets to the heart of the kind of activity which I would
seek as the very alternatives to the mainstream/dominant, blah blah blah, poets in
power that so aggravates you. What I don't understand is why you want a piece of
that pie. The value of the languageblobs (since they've all been lumped together
here, it's just one big blob) it seems to me was the creation of a separate
economy of poetry production, distribution, etc. We all know the story. When I
worked up in the poetry rare books collection (back in 92-93) I catalogued
magazines, noting when issues were missing etc. Despite what Katy Lederer says in
her review of Meow Press, that was the closest I got to being a part of the
largest crime in the 20th century. (I don't have it with me as I don't have a copy
of the PPN, so that is a rough paraphrase). The point of this anecdote is that I
came to see how the various poets later affiliated with a "movement" such as
languageblob poetry found each other from discrete universes and universities
often scattered among negligible zines or often, in the case of mags such as
Truck, started by David Wilk (I believe while at Yale U), fledgling small startup
outfits run on mimeo etc. There was no grand conspiracy to take over anything,
just similar tendencies and responses to a set of circumstances as various as the
"New American" poetry to the political upheavals at the end of the 60s. Despite
whatever feeling you might have about that historical phenom, the point for me has
always been the empowerment I felt by that example. And this is exactly what I
feel when I run into things like Runaway Spoon, or Abacus, or The Impercipient, or
whatever. These moves are extremely important to me. So when I ask you, Bob, for
alternatives, it is simply because you and my pal Bill Howe here in the buff, are
offering a separate economy of such production and networking. I was always amazed
when my fiction writer friend Lara Stapleton, now running a series at the
Nuyorican by the way, wanted to send her stories to Playboy, thinking that to be
the benchmark for acceptance, fame, blah blah blah (ringing in the ears) for a
young fiction writer. I'm surprised, therefore, that your attacks on Perloff
aren't addressed to the New Yorker, which it seems, offers a similar standard of
"having arrived." My complaint with her--and this goes back to the late 80s, when
her story printed in my mag BigFireProofBox (edited with the late Christopher Ide)
was cited by the one-and(hopefully)-only Grill Marcus as being "1000 times as punk
as the line it attempts to erase." Lara, I thought, thought develop a group of
friends, a network of cohorts, working within the "underground" (which I don't
romanticize, but which seems to me to be the necessary precondition of ferment out
of which serious "change" ((of all flavors)) is bound to occur. Lara disagreed,
although now I think she understands this, and has developed such a group of
people whose work she considers "The Shit." (my term not hers, btw)

OK--so that is a giantsized disclaimer to the hatcheting you think I am involved
in here. Let me get to a few of your points.

I'm sorry I didn't understand your mock seminar, but I truly didn't. And because
I'm not interested in splitting hairs over the languageblob poets, but your canon
of languageblob poets was pretty much unrecognizable to me. Part of my job as a
member of Saddam Hussein's Elite Imperial Guard is to diffuse the reception,
dissemination and yayaya of such a canon. I don't buy it and more importantly, I
don't read it that way. So given that, your "equation" pretty much didn't work for
me. I'm sorry. I got the point, and appreciated what you were trying to do, but
because such a "plug-in" doesn't work on my 1988 mac2cx, I couldn't respond. I
could have said "huh?" but I felt it best to leave it drop, so to speak.

I think I've addressed this. Kudos again. This is the kind of action that will be
properly recognized as people like Bill Howe and myself grow up into properly
functioning critical citizens--and there are many more kritik-kids who are looking
for something to believe in. So serve it up Sammy.

I've seen what your crowd has done. I'll go back and read the explanations. Thanks

Tell me more. This is getting closer to what I need to know about what your
crissakes gripe is. Obviously Miekal thought enough of the yungin CB to publish
him. I guess what I mean by "alternatives" in this space would be to offer up an
online seminar, with much lecturing, analysis, and description. I am unable to
attend to much of the online material availble from my cave in buffalo. Please
tell me what the problem is with doing something akin to the "previsual" work of
Mallarme...and I'm not trying to offer up Charles as a visual poet, or even a
language poet for that matter. Again, he IS the leader of the languageblob poets,
so whatever he says goes. But when you put on your decoder glasses, I think you'll
find that the blobs are really specks. Whatever power charles has is potentially a
real problem. Your hesitancy (and Bill's) to rip on him is sympomatic of that
wierd paranoia about such power.

It also brings up another, related point. As a listmember since the olden times of
1993-94, I've noticed that everytime someone brings up some kind of oppositional
or dissenting view with regard to languageblob poetry, it is assumed that we the
Coporation for National Poetics will edit, censor, or delete such opinions from
the discussion on this listserv. Only once has anyone ever been removed for bad
behavior, and the Red Slider affair last summer led to the institution of a few
policys (I should say enforcement of already established policies) which aint bad
for a list with almost 600 people subscribed and who knows how many actually
reading. This list could be moderated, and it isn't. So think about that. Think
about all the private, subset, lists out there which exist because people can't
handle all the noise on this channel. But y'all have been great these last weeks,
so you'll all receive a candy in your mailbox.

But this issue is related to the question of power, status, and the anxiety about
where it resides in the poetry world. My question about the Stanford grads is a
serious one. Maybe you should find out who they are and canvas them. This has
worked in seminars where I was unhappy with the material...perhaps you could send
them a series of URLs or a photocopy packet of your own. It is rumored that you
have a xerox machine in your house, so that wouldn't be putting you out. But I'm
serious about the Disney thing. Since summer, I've been trying to sell Meow Press,
it's title list, the whole lot. Only a few offers so far. A subsidiary of Disney
(actually a sub sub subsidiary of ABC made me an offer, but it wasn't a full
buyout). I have tried to make the press friendly to such a takeover, one which
would leave me still doing the design work . I was actually hoping that Messerli
or his ilk would have stepped in, as I still have that revolutionary fever, but
alas, only some guy named David Milch (sp?) called me looking to see if Charles B.
and Ben Yarmonlinsky wouldn't mind having THE SUBJECT done as Simpsonsesque
miniseries...

in a list where each of us is endlessly evolving workable affiliations

I think the obvious outcome of the "perloff paradigm" is a wakeup call
about how poorly the worlds of visual poetry, hypermedia, performance &
installation have been integrated with the readerly world.  as for
offering an alternative, that is already largely in place & has been in
place as far as I can tell since international networking &
person-to-person exchanges have been taking place, & that alternative
was already in place when I started with xerox sutra in 80.  more
specifically related to this digital monolith we are all cowriting, I
think the immediate & accessible alternative is to increase the
bandwidth for works of all styles & media, just as Ive heard far more
about new writers & presses via this list than any other source.  as for
complaining, we know about complaining, sometimes you just gotta be the
bitchard to get things done.



 If it isn't about achieving "acadominance" (and

actually Joel youve hit it on the head, since I was thrown out &/or quit
college 8 times (8 semesters, 8 attempts, 100% failure) & now about to
become a graybeard with no piece of paper, Im hoping for an honory
degree or two out there, so I'll have something to show for all my time,
in a world where status is a monkish nailbiter, Im a status seeker.

when in fact I feel like thruout this discussion my intent was to
represent the scale & the history of a century long affair with the
visual text & in particular an attention to how networking & mail
inspired a hyperculture that has a life of its own.  & as for the lame &
superficial medium begat by the "vizpobiz boys" (& girls), goat compost.

Luigi, the points you make relate to what hit me after sending that post,
which is that "movements" themselves have a certain "synthetic, teleological"
energy.  I didn't mean to suggest that groups simply generate mechanical
repetition. But I think there's a tendency to over-rationalize art
movements; the moves or manifestos are always as limiting as they are
liberating.  Again, I insist that the really great art releases something
via a synthetic process in which the rational or strategic will is in
abeyance rather than control.  Or at least "in collaboration".

I just finished reading PhillyTalks #3.  I'm sorry not everybody on the list
has access to this; it's a discussion between Ron Silliman & Jeff Derksen,
along with some creative work by each.  As many of you know (it's been
discussed here before) Ron, among other things, gives a historical view
on his work in connection with language poetry & what comes after or should.
He's also moving & eloquent about the state of the world (& the US) & the
consequent moral issue for writing & poetry.  He blames "habit" for
what I would call indifference, selfishness, callousness (there are good habits
) - the passivity which allows even greater evils to take root. The role
of the artist is a prophetic one: to combat complacent habit & challenge
mass culture by means of estrangement.

He places language poetry within this tradition but is clear-sighted
about it's time-bound function (as I tried to point out a couple days
ago with the idea that the "elders" themselves see that their own techniques
no longer match the current political atmosphere), and he raises the
question, why has there been no comparable "90s" "crystallization" of
artistic energies?  (This has become a provocative issue on the list,
as everybody knows following Steve Evans, Mark Wallace, & other's posts.)

I don't think he was aiming to answer the question right then & there,
but his approach toward an answer seems in keeping with both his own
& Jeff Derksen's general perspective.  He says: perhaps it has to do with
the decline of the national state & the rise of the global economy (this
is a rough paraphrase).

What strikes me in both Ron's & Jeff's statements is how saturated they are
with socio-political critique.  It is a given that the organization of
society as we know it is a kind of irredeemable hell.  Derksen refers to
a forthcoming essay by Sianne Ngai which purportedly contrasts an aesthetic
of pleasure with an aesthetic of "disgust & overdetermination".  This is
an understandable reaction to a world culture supersaturated with information
in the form of "bad news", but I would think (I haven't had a chance to read
the essay yet!) it's not enough for a strong aesthetic; the literature of
disgust and condemnation might be valid and appropriate, but when it becomes
a fashion, a movement, a ruling style, etc., it's a sort of contradiction
in terms. The dangers of such an aesthetic would include the tendency to
become purely (&self-righteously) rhetorical, as well as to
lose a self-critical edge: anything that critiques "the way things are"
is justified as "art". I think we are all familiar with this trend in the
arts.

By suggesting a socio-political explanation for why a "new crystallization"
on a par with language poetry has not yet occurred, Ron is following this
trend. & I would argue that the answer to his question - where a new
development is to be found - has already been supplied earlier in the
dialogue; by Ron himself, when he talks about all art as a "tuning of the
senses" via an overdetermination, if you will, of stimulae; and by Jeff,
when he argues that the political impact of estrangement is not supplied
so much by disjunction as by "radical _conjunction_" - the JOINING of
dangerous taboo political contexts within the energy of clear artistic
description (& Derksen uses examples from Silliman's own work to illustrate).

I would argue that an aesthetic of pure critique, not firmly grounded in
artistic processes, ends up one-sided and rhetorical.  As I suggested in
a previous post, art is a kind of uncanny energy which spins out of the
artist's full control but brings joy in the process - a joy which spreads
& subsumes critique & re-orients everything in its path.  This is Whitman's
daemonic Laugh coming from the Rockies. It becomes a super-synthesis of
speech/drawing/voice/gesture - not a move-in-reaction to previous trends
but a kind of perennial activity.  It is with such a synthetic approach,
giving full weight to the artistic process in itself, which I would posit
the current generation is already engaged & which could be "crystallized"
in recognizable academic-literary-historical format suitable for framing
anthologizing & convertible into deadhead bears if you like.  - Henry Gould

p.s. "no poetry after the Holocaust".  a human reaction (from a critic).
Ron's diatribe against American evils is EXACTLY right.  Right as a diatribe.
But art built on political critique - it doesn't work.  The poets who died
in Chile, Russia, Spain, for being poets... they were poets, first of all.
Poetry is its own thing - this is the mysterious wonder of it, its
limitation and infinity. Only those who understand this limitation can
humanize it in the way Ron has; without the human element, of course, it's
empty wind, a clanging cymbal, Ivan the Terrible's court jester.  We've
all seen enough of that.

Thank you for your irony here, Henry. I suppose I am part of this "new
generation" and these worries about "crystallization" or not
"cystallization" frankly mystify me. ('I have brought the great acorn of
crystal / who can lift it?' or whatever EP said.) Why? Well,

a) there is a hell of lot of "crystallization" going on, in that many of the
presses and magazines are just as controlled as they ever were by people
intent on COW POEMs... and the rest are controlled by the new alternative
dominant hegemonic STYLE musheads .. and the rest are controlled by the next
newest dominant hegemonic STYLE mushheads... etc.c. etc. etc. layers and
layers of mushheads as high as the sky with nothing but accreted centuries
of COW POEMS on top, world without end, amen; your CRYSTALLIZATION is my
OLIGARCHY:

that is, why worry about artistic cohesion when ten kazillion MFA poets are
each writing one million poems a year trying to get into the Paris Review
and of the few hundred or few thousand lucky poets who are publishing (me
among them), NONE (statistically speaking) are being read anyway? That is,
NOMAN reads with his one good eye as he munches sailors for breakfast and he
don't want any avant-garde poetics, son...

b) there really are fewer and fewer places to publish, period, even if one
does write COW POEMs

c) i would be HAPPY for an audience of twenty at Stanford including Marjorie
Perloff; that is, THE AUDIENCE, what AUDIENCE, if you want an AUDIENCE,
there's Mick Jagger, go learn to play guitar

d) goddam it, we're all working ourselves to death making a living--nice
cushy academic jobs? forget it... i have to work 52 weeks a year just like
every other middle class yahoo tied at the gut to the Great Satan Capitalist
Wheel--and we're running our presses--which we get damn little interest in
from anyone, especially including the concerned Crystallized graybeards who
have already made careers mumbling about theory--and we're raising our kids
and GODDAM IT we're in the middle of all this trying to do our own work and
further our own educations--yes I do read Raymond Williams at 2 AM after a
long workday because THERE IS NO OTHER TIME TO DO IT--and the whole thing is
goddamned exhausting trying to write a few dozen NEW poems in the middle of
this ongoing pigfuck of a civilization and these MORONS are lamenting the
lack of CRYSTALLIZATION, ELAN, great culture-transcending elegant congeries
of what bald headed buddhists writing language poems? Please.

I mean at the rate things are going, I won't be suprised when Happy Bill
announces that due to problems with bitching, pomposity, and perpetual
hair-splitting internecine wars the US will now be IMPORTING all its POETRY
from MEXICO, thank you very much, fast cheap and happy little poems good for
the balance of payments and those GODDAM MEWLING POETS can just report to
Wal-Mart for RE-EDUCATION starting now.

Kent --

Thanks for the kind words, and also for the advice, which ever since Lee
Ann Brown's computer spell-checked my name into Jordan Advise, I've been
awaiting. There's a huge fire burning down at Chrystie and Delancey as I
type this; I hope it's not at Sammy's Rumanian Steakhouse. Your comment
that new poetry offers little opposition to anything except a relatively
restricted band of previous poetic practice (am I getting this right? my
reading comprehension scores were always so-so) (you know Queen Victoria's
comparison of Gladstone and Disraeli? with Gladstone she felt as though
she'd had dinner with the smartest man in the world; while Disraeli made
her feel like the smartest woman in the world) arrived on my machine
around the same time Chris Stroffolino's remark about the B Mayer
interview in the PPN -- that it's good to see a poet offering opposition
not just within the frame (coff coff) of poetic practice but with her life
(and I'm pretty sure I'm not getting that right). I'm going to leave aside
the part about which generation had the best sex (nobody, not even the
president has such...never mind) long enough to say yes, inasmuch as the
traditional avant-garde forms of production and distribution have been
withheld from younger poets for lack of credential mastery ear whatever
younger poets have gone out and manufactured substitutes -- for writing
styles, for subject matter, for reading series, for books magazines
pamphlets bumper stickers ugh. You're saying, I take it, that Yasusada is
an attempt to wake us up to the possibility that the whole factory of
presentation can go fall in a swamp (pronounced so as to rhyme with
on-ramp). We know that. Over on the CAP-L list not long ago Al Corn had
some other issue maybe somehwaet less sophisticated to argue -- I think it
was that the style one chooses is like the house one decides to buy: a
colonial, a Cape Cod, an infundibuliform corolla.  The thing is, even if
it is a sort of boat in the mud, a house doesn't seem like that bad a
thing to get, if it can be done. And Joel, I suppose a book is only for
the author to have a warm feeling in his tea, as much as a poem is -- but
if there's a book, the feeling can go many places at once, which is a goal
of the best human commerce, no? Blame is not that interesting. Furthermore
publishers, like the beloved, seem to seek out what reflects them at least
a little. To mock my own logic, you could say that if we were really going
nowhere the language poets didn't go, we'd all have books announced 3 yrs
ago from Sun & Moon sure to arrive in stores any year now, and who knows!
Isn't it funny when the word "pervert" shows up in poetry? What could be
more perverse than to be a poet, and yet, and yet, "perverted acts in
pastures" and "beware of boys in tight pants/ they are perverts". Which is
(I guess way too obliquely) to say that although the younger writers
mentioned all thru this discussion (and I suppose the older ones too) do
in fact show up on time for work, hustling through the conventions,
passing mss. around all while studying ukelele and ornamental guava
freestyle politics and all the other apparently Kiwanis-style secret
handshakes, we also have lives (or not), we also have sex (or not), we
also play around with conventions of authorship (or we make art). The part
you see is (as you are sublimely aware, Kent Johnson) only the part you
see.

Which brings me to a technical question -- I understand that Bernadette's
against monogamy, but does her cited defense -- that a woman would have to
love washing and cooking for it to work -- does that defense at once rile
and disappoint anyone else? Seems to me the real argument against monogamy
at this late date is not that women are expoitable for household labor
(which I don't doubt) but that the rewards for monogamy -- avoiding
noxious life-threatening shaming, paper after the first year, rocks on the
2nd anniversary, swivelchair coasters on the 3rd etc -- seem to be
dwindling all the time.

Dwindling all the time,
Your colloid

I just watched a family movie dull enough to cause me to drink the fatal
martini (the 3rd), in the interests of, y'know, family togetherness. I
forget the name : a nice-looking young man murdered people for a living
(oh, it was "Grosse Point Blank") while reconstituting himself via a
highschoolreunion/sweetheart. What made my wife laugh the most is always of
interest to me : in this case, when two systems of representation
intersect, one where the hero is killing people by whanging lead into their
tissue with guns and the other where he is begging her for just one more
chance of soft mammal/human consideration/"love", and the director/editor
cuts back and forth between both. I always wonder about her,at such times,
and therefore, about myself (and then i think hard for all of us). But that
isnt what I set out to say.

I only wanted to say (1) that Kent Johnson's posting y-clept "The Key Club"
sounds important and so please read it w/o prejudice. I myself intend to
address it in some substantial way tomorrow if not too harried by
door-to-door professional killers wanting to crash my superbowl party.
But/and (2), PLEASE everyone remember some of us have sadly inadequate
software so please dont post posts as lengthy as this one Kent just posted.
Break them down into 2 or more portions.

Btw, isn't Kent great? Whatever yr disagreements (and he often finds me
disagreeable), try to imagine this list w/o him.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

picking up a thread via Harold Rhenisch from 3 days since (it's been hectic
Listwise!), I'd like to mention the Canada Council's program that pays
authors royalties for their books that are held in libraries. Half a dozen
Canadian libraries (which, shifts) each year are checked, and for each book
there written by an author who has signed on with this program, that author
receives what is termed a "hit," the value of which varies somewhat from
year to year, but so far has approximated CAN $33. There's a ceiling of
CAN$4,000 per author per year.(So that, for e.g., someone like George
Bowering, with his phenomenally long list of titles, must each year hit the
ceiling before his output is exhausted).

Too bad, btw, that no such program exists in the USA.

When the program began, no limit was set as to the length of the book. But
the program quickly became so costly that the Council had to insist that,
henceforth, nothing 48 pp or less could be considered a book. This, they
said, was a defintion used by UNICEF.

I believe that by this definition, neither Wordsworth's _Lyrical Ballads_,
nor Rilke's _Duino Elegies_ was a book.

Obviously, this must encourage Canadian authors and publishers to make sure
their books are at least 48 pp long. Or so one assumes. Perhaps a study has
been done on this score. I agree with some recent posts to this List, that
comparisons in the matter of physical length are odious to civilized people
(I suppose because thereby primacy is accorded to the animal over the
civilized), and it is unfortunate to find a governmental agency being
forced, via economic necessity, to adopt such an arbitrary standard.
Happily, though, to end on the upbeat, no reward is offered for mere
length-------4,448 pp warrant no more than 48.  David

That term, 48 pages or less, should really have read no more than 48
pages, or fewer than 48 pages.

Hello all!

We've started the Texas Poetry ListServ.  If you're interested in
discussing poetry in Texas, read on; there should be plenty of information
to get you going.  Otherwise, apologies.




Why the list

A lot of interest has been shown in creating a community online for Texas
poets.  We wanted to create a space where people can discuss their ideas,
learn, tell others about their events, review events and hopefully,
strengthen poetry in Texas.



What exactly is discussed on the list?

Almost anything to do with poetry in Texas.  That might include discussion
of poetry technique, event postings, random reviews and so forth.  The list
is not for attacking individuals, thou.  The list is not moderated, but if
you're spotted attacking someone, you'll get warned.  If that doesn't work,
you'll be unsubscribed and not allowed back.  We're pretty easy going, but
the list is intended to be a positive force, not a field for ego warfare.



What'll happen if you join

You'll be able to send emails to an email address
(texaspoetry@datawranglers.com) that will be forwarded to the other
subscribers to the list.  In return, you'll receive the emails sent in by
the other list participants.  You'll also occasionally receive notes about
changes to how the list operates.  They'll be rare, have a subject line
beginning with "ADMIN" and will probably be both boring and slightly
important.



Subscribing to the list

You can join the discussion by sending an email with the blank subject link
and 'subscribe texaspoetry' and you name in the body (leave the subject
blank!) to: macjordomo@datawranglers.com.  If your name is 'John Smith',
your subscription email might look somethign like:

             To: macjordomo@datawranglers.com
           From: john_smith@mydomain.com
        Subject:
        ________________________________________________

        subscribe texaspoetry John Smith




After you subscribe

After you send in your subscription email, you'll receive an automated
response telling you how to unsubscribe.  What happens after that is up to
you.  If you want to participate, send your email to:
texaspoetry@datawranglers.com.



Subject Ettiquette

In a few cases, you can help the other members of our community by
beginning the subject line of your email with a phrase, like EVENT.

                       Type of Email                Begin your subject
                                                    ____ line with ___
        Emails on events                              'EVENT'.
       press releases/whatever by major publishers   'COMMERCIAL'
        Changes to this FAQ & other adminstrativalia  'ADMIN'

The last one ('ADMIN') should not be used by anyone but the list trolls
chewing on the emails you send in.



Ack, What about my most important question?

Feel free, if the FAQ didn't answer a question clearly (or at all) to send
quesitons directly to: tim_wood@datawranglers.com.



Making suggestions on this FAQ

This FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) is preliminary and probably always
will be.  If you've got suggestions, for now please send them to:

tim_wood@datawranglers.com



Changes to this FAQ

We'll send a note to the list with changes to the faq.

Enjoyed your response.(Seriously folks, and at the risk of seeming
obsequious, who has the most delightful prose on the list, JD or
DB? It's close.) And Jordan, if I've been invoking your name of late,
it's for the most part to feed off the background energy of your
ripostes and carry myself forward as best I can. All in jousting
spirit.

Long live the Queeen.

For what it's worth, though, since you raised the issue, I wnated to
say that Yasusada was not at all written to make this or that
point at all. To the extent that the work seems to raise issues, that
is a secondary and largely accidental (though still possibly
interesting, I think) outcome of a work that happened to take a
particular and very idiosyncratic form because that's the form that
seemed compelled by the writing, and vice versa and so on. In short,
though Yasusda's writing may not have achieved the status of "art,"
as you say, I don't at all think that writing against the grain of
"conventions of authorship" on the one hand and "art" on the other is
an either/or thing. Actually, a famous philosopher wrote a beautiful
and strange book entitled Either/Or and a number of other ones undr a
variety of heteronyms, and he insisted to the end that these
cahracters were the real "authors" of his works, that they were a
matter of "thought" and "production." And then Existentialism
started. And that, of course, would be just one example.

Finally, I wanted to clarify just one thing about my Key Club
metaphor. I said something to the effect that in the absence of real
_conceptual_ subversiveness and verve, that "the Key Club will always
be the Key Club." What I meant is tht the Key Club will always be the
Key Club and that Kiwanis will always be Kiwanis, albeit with ever
changing faces and names. Those current and earnest members of the
Key Club will do many good deeds in the image of their sponsors (whom
they love and hate simultaneously) and graduate into Kiwanis, where
they will grow successful. respectable, and old, and come to feel
smug and superior enough to say mildly condescending things about
their own underlings in the Key Club. I meant, in other words, that
the deeper dynamics of the poetry institution (with all its local
"avant-garde" turbulence) would not fundamentally change. There is a
sense, I mean, in which cultural "experiment" reduced to method or
style is a "good deed" done, ultimately, in the historical interests
of the greater episteme.

Episteme? Well, you know what I mean.

Go Pack Go!

I feel that my mock syllabus says most of what I want to say on this
subject.  If you didn't realize that my "canon" was intended to be
"pretty much unrecognizable" to anyone who knows language poetry, I
don't know what further I can do for you.  The people I named (as a
representative group, not a canon) are to language poetry what the
people invited to give readings for Perloff's seminar are to visual
poetry.

As for my addressing my attacks to the New Yorker instead of Perloff, if
the New Yorker had published a piece on the state of visual poetry in
America that overlooked as much of the scene as Perloff's seminar does,
I would have attacked it.  But I recognize the New Yorker as being in
a field too far away from what I'm interested to count for much.
Perloff is a different story, which is a big compliment to her, I'm
sure.

Otherwise, Joel, although I found your letter entertaining, it was
really too dipsy-doodle for me to try to respond to in any further
detail here.

I don't the answer to that.  Although, many poets who live in Texas don't

One of the more interesting facets of poetry in Texas, is that a
significant number of the poets are not native to Texas or the region.
But, as often as not, they've lived here as long as anywhere else.  This
raises interesting questions on identity, geography and culture.  Even for
those who are native to this region, the mix of major cultural influences,
the state's different geographical regions, not to mention the
international border and the state's history as a former independent
nation, create some really interesting questions in regard to identity.

At the same time, just as one's personal life doesn't define one's poetry,
I don't believe identity, culture, geography, etc., determine one's poetry.
 I still have memories of professors who felt that so-and-so's horrible
life, bad teeth, heritage explains all their work.  I believe that falls in
the category of 'people who don't get it'.  Both experience and identity
are much better used as the starting point for other issues.

folks--

it really is quite unfortunate that the discussion around VizPo has
deteriorated to "bob g.'s crowd" (how'd you get ownership, bob? homesteaded
it, did ya?) vs drs perloff & bernstein.  i think there are real issues
here, but propriatary claimstaking is hardly th point...

i've had some sympathy w/ bob's initial criticism, or what i took as it's
subtext: that mp's visual poetry seminar, as reflected in her syllabus, has
an unstated bias towards a particular aesthetic and/or a community of
poets, to wit the LangPo "school".  i myself have nothing against
partisanship, and it's an obvious contradition for bob to criticize mp's
biases only to lobby for biases ov his own...  but it's not amiss to point
out hidden agendas, and to offer correctives.

by way of data, and in ref to th syllabus in question:  surveying the
required & recommended reading list of single-author contemporary titles:
fifteen authors; 4 of whom appear in _in the american tree_, 3 in _the
l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e book_, 3 in _the art of practice_, and 4 in _from the other
side of the century_.  insofar as these anthologies might serve as mappings
of some "moment or movement", it seems that a large percentage of the
emphasised readings are taken from a constrained corpus ov material...

    (i'll point out, as an aside, that in almost none of the anthologized
     work from this moment/movement is the visual component significant
     enough to merit reproduction in the original graphic format--which
     suggests either that th visual work by these poets is not considered
     by their editor/peers to be important, or that the visual component
     is not central to th aesthetic...).

the anthologies, supplemental readings, and websites certainly go far to
balance the picture...  (and i'll add another reference for those
interested: David W. Seaman's _Concrete Poetry in France_ (ann arbor: umi
reasearch press, 1981)).   still, both the primary & secondary sources seem
largely restricted to university/scholarly sources [what did you expect,
bob?].  but there are whole cultures and communities of visual poetry that
(i believe conciously) position themselves outside the cultural apparatus
of the acadamy--they are nonetheless deserving of attention, especially in
the context of a seminar which seems strive for inclusiveness.  bob's pointed
to some of those sources already, & i'll enlarge: Score, Kaldron, Light & Dust,
Xexoxial Endarchy, Luna Bisonte, Generator Press, dbqp, curvd H&z, Red Lines,
Ninth St. Labs, Runaway Spoon...  anyone who is interested in Visual Poetry
really owes it to themselves to check out some of these publishers' offerings.

     The Ballad of Sexual Obsession


1
There goes a man who's won his spurs in battle
The butcher, he. And all the others, cattle.
The cocky sod!  No decent place lets him in.
Who does him down, that's done the lot? The women.
Want it or not, he can't ignore that call.
Sexual obsession has him its thrall.

He doesn't read the Bible. He sniggers at the law.
Sets out to be an utter egoist
And knows a woman's skirts are what he must resist
So when a woman calls he locks his door.
So far, so good, but what's the future brewing?
As soon as night falls he'll be up and doing.

2
Thus many a man watched men die in confusion:
A mighty genius, stuck on prostitution!
The watchers claimed their urges were exhausted
But when they died who paid the funeral? Whores did.
Want it or not, they can't ignore that call.
Sexual obsession has them in its thrall.

Some fall back on the Bible. Some set out to change the law.
Some turn to Christ. Others turn anarchist.
At lunch you pick the best wine on the list
Then meditate till half past four.
At tea: what high ideals you are pursuing!
Then soon as night falls you'll be up and doing.

- Bertolt Brecht

Kent,

Thanks for the welcome.  I've mostly been lurking for quite some time.  I
try and limit my comments to those where I feel like I've got something to
add.  Between the speed of the posts, my busy schedule and the brain power
floating in and out of this list, that's a rarity.

A brief response to what Luigi-Bob just posted:

(1) I've been using "'my crowd'"--always in quotation marks--merely
quickly to refer to the people in visual poetry to whom I believe
Perloff has paid insufficient attention.

(2) I've taken pains to emphasize that I have no problem with any poetry
group's being boosted, and I have never hinted that I want "my crowd"
(here we are again) promoted INSTEAD of anyone else (except a few I feel
need no extra promotion).  ALONG WITH everyone else has always been what
I've called for.

Otherwise, nice post, L-B.

If it is true that the gift of a volume of Whitman helps shatter the
presidency, the *poetry makes nothing happen* crowd has some explaining to
do.  Me, I keep thinking of a line Kevin Davies published a few years ago
in *Thunk* (Situations, 1995): "Clinton licks tender inner thigh of
corporate crud agenda."

Think I answered this query in a previous post.  Let me repeat: I was born
in North Carolina, have lived peacefully under a pseudonym for several
years in Brainerd, MN, and am wanted in seven states, including Texas.
Coupla Rangers almost got me once outside Fort Worth, but they were

Bob,

to your responses, including

>>I've taken pains to emphasize that I have no problem with any poetry
group's being boosted, and I have never hinted that I want "my crowd"
(here we are again) promoted INSTEAD of anyone else (except a few I feel

I've called for.<<

you have my support, and puzzlement, too.

Your passion leaves me enthused, but all this talk about Perloff's adequate
or inadequate course on visual poetry leaves me puzzled. Why does it matter
what she teaches? Visual poetry is not alone in this morass of
misdefinition. Every facet of current poetry is misdefined and
misdelineated. The whole field is a mess. If we are to make real progress
it will come through Miekel's attitude of working outside the academy, and
through a total redefinition of what is taught in the academy.
Language/visual poets and mainstream/lyrical poets often regard each other
with dismissal and suspicion. I think we need new terms of reference, which
will show common ground, wiping clear indulgence and confessional bilge on
both 'sides'.

 I have faith that you are trying to ensure that visual poetry is not
misdefined, but I ask again, why does it matter what Perloff teaches? It
must only matter if she is the agent of change. I don't think she is, in
the sense you mean. The university environment is basically a conservative
one, of sifting, of maintaining, of drawing or breaking patterns. With few
exceptions, it is not a revolutionary one of seeking out the new. I don't
mean this as a criticism.

Perloff's contribution might be to build some sort of vision of where
things are going, in which she is able to touch upon some forms of visual
poetry. That this grand vision does not touch upon the work vital to you
might not be Perloff's problem. It's yours, it's ours, and it's an
important problem, but to deal with it it's time to move beyond Perloff. In
your context, I have trouble seeing how she is important. Because of her
influence? Because there is no alternative, although there should be?

If, as I suspect, you see the humanities as a faculty akin to, say,
molecular biology, working on the cutting edge of the new, obsolete
tomorrow but built upon day by day, that is perhaps where you should begin,
not by attacking Perloff. If Perloff, as an elite representative of a
conservative institution in a conservative state, wishes to  write from
within her metaphor, and if, as I see it, you stand outside that metaphor,
I humbly suggest that you might get farther by redefining Perloff's role,
rather than by redefining her course. The course is small change.

I'd be interested in your thoughts.

cheers,

This paragraph echoes with a roomful of echoes.  "Poetry" (discipline)
compared with "biology".  The cutting edge of biology is the cloning of
human beings as objects of scientific curiosity & ambition.  I suppose
that's what they deserve considering what they're doing to the oceans,
rainforests, and "tribal peoples".  Academia fully $$$upportive.
But academia needs art, like evrybody needs style (Lewis Lapham says
literature is now a mode of interior decorating). So we'll keep the remnants
alive on the fringes.  At least Perloff recognizes change as something
invigorating rather than dangerous.  & we love her for that, out here in
snowbound Buffalo, where the rust belt instills us with memory & resistance.
& Grumman is grubbin' along very hard in the same survival-instinct tunnel.

Poetry (and art in general) would be much poorer places (sic, yes) without
the elements of resistance (political and otherwise) or memory.  I'm more
than happy to leave the pursuit of assimilation and forgetfulness to the
marketing types.

i disagree. abt working outside of the academy. i am a 3rd year Ph.D
student in English lit. bill bissett is doing a reading here tomorrow and
i just spent all day mounting a show of his stuff based on reproductions
and library books. i did this in an office space that's reserved for
retired faculty - i did this "inside" the university, in a department
where i'm pretty much considered an "outsider." i teach visual poetry and
concrete poetry and performance poetry and collaboratiove poetry in
courses on medieval lit., in courses on modern drama, even in "poetry"
courses. i'm told i am - and that my approach is - "unconventional,"
"unorthodox." that's just silly and it's, well . . . my point: there are a
lot of us working inside the institution. bill bissett knew early on he
wasn't one of those. he is a brave spirit outside. so maybe i am a brave
spirit inside. but i wonder how many students, first year & last year,
graduate and faculty, will pass by the _bill bissett Magik Room_
tomorrow - on their way downstairs to hear him read - and i wonder how
many might just stop in, sign th guest book, look around, feel transformed by
what you can do with words. this will happen inside. to tell th truth -
i dont even know if there even is an inside or an outside. and th word
"progress" really makes me nervous, but that's another issue for later

Carl, progress towards redefinition and renewal only.

I envy you Bissett and his magik room. Keep up the good work. Just a
question: having Bissett at SFU, does this change or break down the
boundaries set up between schools of poetry? Or does it put Visual poetry
within that set of boundaries? Both are valid. I just want to see more of
the former, that's all.

Now, Henry, to your

>>p.s. maybe we could market a line of Perloff Poetry Pups - cute little

You betcha! We could stuff the fuzzy little guys with shredded copies of
Leaves of Grass. There might just be some copies already shreaded in
Washington that we could get cheap. Of course, the seams might be poorly
done, and these little scraps of Whitman might come leaking through.

Geez, cloning though. Whew. I thought most poetry was already cloned.

joel new quite well that i was working sat from dawn til late and used his
oportunity wisely indeed and now i find myself in the possition of needing
to respond to many voices instead of just one or two. ill start with saying
something about charles seminar as apposed to marjories. cbs day at the
beach was meant to be just that and the day was made up of texts that were
commonly available or otherwise easily placed on reserve at the graduate
library pointing out that many more possibilities were available for
perusal at the poetry room (with the special help of m. basinski) this was
only ment to be an intro a feeler a taste to bring people back a dealers
freebee. mp's seminar is a complete corpus of study and as a consequence it
represents an ostensibly organic whole purporting to give an overview of an
entire field of production when really what is at stake is a form of
political justifacation for the importance of a group of poets whom she has
championed for a long time (and i might add i see nothing wrong with her
championing of language writing-my poetics would not be possible in its
form now without a marxist critic of the materiality and economy of meaning
and language) and which has little to do with practicing visual poets here
on this continent. Now having said that i think i should say somthing to
several peoples critic of why does this all matter well marjories seminar
at s is an important place for forming the ideas and opines of not only her
students but her students students. even though this might seem like an
extremely paranoid and possibly provincial attitude the fact remains that
mp is a loud and lasting critical voice and she has been responsible at
least in part for the acceptence of experimental writing in a less than
enthused accademic crowd. so what she says and what she teaches and what
she does have a bearing on poetics as an endeavor however any of us may
feel (her books are published in large quantities and are some of the only
books on poetics dealing with experiment widely available and accessible to
most readers)insofaras we percieve poetics as a negotiation among
practitioners and thinkers (not to say that these are mutually exclusive).

now the next thing i think i should respond to again stems from joels
exemplifying druckers the visible word as a means of engaging visual
poetry. and ill admit that taken on its title alone the book seems to be
the perfect companion for visual poetry. my problem with this work is not
so much as with what it deals with but what it implies for the rest of
practitioners. drucker is quite understandably concerned with the
conception and production of type. type as object, type as form, type as
visual florition. and as a consequence her book is concerned with the
evolution of type and the production of art with type. she sees the page
still as a jamsian window to narrative to action to theatre and relates the
visual to the world of the stage. not as a visual medium in and of itself.
she says of marinettis work of the late teens (were he began to use
distorted typographic elements) "the typographic elements were no longer
incidentally visual, but fully visual . . . the voyeuristic emphasis
positions the reader to _look_ into the situation . . .the visual
distribution of linguistic elements, into a violent field of revery . . .
provided them with a signifying value." langauge here is still meaningful
in a 19th century kind of way. there are truths of both a linguistic and
visual nature. in and of itself there is nothing wrong with this reading of
this text (or as a corolative of druckers reading of most of her examples)
but what is missing is an appriciation and a reading of text as
non-linguistic visual representation. drucker approaches this with a
narrative of "at night, in her bed" but fails to see the letters as shape
as dream/sex itself. the visible word is a wonderful book on typography and
the uses of typography in futurist and surrealist texts but it does nothing
in terms of visual collage poetry (two contemporary practitioners are wendy
kramer and kapulani [just off the top of my 6 in the morning head])
non-linguistic visual poetry (cristian boks crystalography or pointedly
featured on the cover of mps book radical artifice steve mccafferys
carnival secondpanel) non- linguistic visual poetry ([many of which perform
these non-linguistic texts verbally] lots o folks aka bob cobbing paula
claire ulli freer allison knowles chris cheek lawrence upton john bennet
mike basinski john byrum etc) or sculptoral poetry (gary indiana ihf allen
kaprow john furnival etc). so terming the visible word a book on visual
poetry is absurd in more ways than one. druckers work surveys typography
not visual use of language.

This is just basically a few words about Joe Safdie's interesting and
thoughtful post...It was predicated on a too-impoverished sense of poetry
is doing as an art-activity...The idea that poetry is primarily about
paraphraseable "meaning"...Thus the emphasis on "how easy a poem is to
interpret", the archaic references to 7 types of etc. etc.

Interesting that right now several exceptionally detailed and substantive
threads are going on...Henry and Joe S. and others attacking their idea of
langpo while Bob G. and others attack Perloff et al. in the name of vispo.
One fascinating aspect of this is, that although both vispo and
commonsensepo partisans feel they are attacking a threateningly hegemonic
Language camp, they are surely in great tension toward *each other*
also...Much of the quite fascinating vispo work I see these days, would
certainly offend against Joe's commonsensepo standards!

I think that's a useful and really absorbing (cf. CB) post there, Kent...

Seriously (more or less) I'm glad you made your argument so
clearly...Including quoting what I thought was maybe the most interesting
and pointed passage in the Doubled Flowering interview...

It would now appear that there are at least four whirling clusters of
atoms currently multiloging here,

langpo
vizpo
commonsensepo
yasusadapo (violent dispersal of the institutionally-constituted author)

The list is becoming very dynamic these days..Certainly no longer what the
Brits called "pofaced."  As we say down south, po' boys all around!

...On a more somber note, I'd like to encourage everyone to get a hold of
Doubled Flowering.  One of the most compelling and challenging and *fun*
pieces of poetic imagination since Ossian.  (It's now out from Roof Books)
I really don't think anyone will want to miss it...At the very least
maybe (like the two alien races in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy) we
can "settle our few remaining differences" and unite to turn on Kent and
rend him to pieces!  Nothing like a common Araki, er, enemy, right?

Henry,
there is no such thing as "art built on political critique," though there
*is* poetry that is aware of its political character.

All poetry is political.

You may believe that there is poetry which is not political..."but it
ain't necessarily so."

Re: Moxley's book preface, she writes:  "Even the love poem agitates the

I have in mind for poetry.  The writer should give enough to move thought and
feeling through someone else.  Instead of vain postures and formal orthodoxy,
do what it takes to connect to something outside of the self.  Arrogant
readerly demands might work in Leisure Land (picture musical notation around

that novels still sell well, and that audiences attend the theater but poetry
more than ever is an isolated art.  Maybe there's something for us to learn?

Mark, I think the list has been around this vague corral before.  But I
never said poetry wasn't political.  Fact in earlier post I said politics
was at the heart of poetry.  What I was saying was: there is something
called "poetry", and it's not a reflection, translation, secondary
phenomenon based on "thinking", philosophy, political standpoint, etc.
& I said, in other words, that I thought the approach to poetry laid out
in PhillyTalks #3 seemed too close to such a secondary phenomenon.
i.e. "the state of the world is like this (socio-politically speaking)
so poetry will do this", etc. It seems too rationalistic & ignores
what I see as poetry's sort of constant, perennial attributes & functions.

p.s. also, your brief list of streams (langpo, commonsensepo, vizpo, etc.)
doesn't seem to contain the specific "crystal" I was spouting about:
an uncommonsensepo that is a visual-verbal-textual gesture spinning
out of control.

so dale, you mean theatre, like spice world and titanic? - and novels,
like judith krantz and um, cold mountain, yeah?

this isnt cultural snobbery per se, to be asking for something that asks
more of the reader (always, collaborator)  than a passive affirmation of
usual structures of seeing/doing/thinking/going about one's day (ie,
falling in love with oneself/'the poet' - dont know about you, but i never
had a 'poet' write love to me, in fact, i'm almost always the only one
doing the reading! - go figure)

'writer should give enough to move thought and feeling through ...' - tell
me what thought is, what feeling is, how a writer (moxley? dale smith?)
puts something down that reaches that ultimate, indefinable, unmarked
territory of universal emotion - and i have an mfa program to sell

i think maria's onto something important, and that has to do with respect
for (which i suppose implies a knowledge of) other folks' lives...

that is, we tend too often to talk in terms of surfaces, b/c any real
intimacy is, well, frightening...

if you really wanna know what someone is doing in the classroom, or on the
assembly line, or in front of their typewriter, you need to be willing to
ask some questions and listen, carefully, for some answers... if you think
said context/place of employment/writing zone should/could/must be
altered---for the "better," however defined---why then you at least need to
understand the terms of said person's engagement with said context... the
constraints as well as the possibilities, which around t/here generally
fall under the rubric, somehow, of "work"...

the territorialities surfacing of late on this list are provocative, yes,
but they're lamentable too... every now and again something bleeds through
that, however much i may disagree, seems charged with the urgency of the
person-in-the-world, or on-the-planet (which is not merely *personal*)...
for which i am thankful, b/c i am mself none too good at making my
assertions *felt* by others...

i wonder whether we can swear our allegiances w/o having to dismantle one
another in the process?...

best,

Believe it or not, some of us belong to the working class and do poetry.
This means (at least if you fight hard enuff for a union, and/or are
lucky) that it's possible to have medical coverage, a wage, etc. Back to
the land is not the only alternative to academe!!

I don't know of any offhand, Miekal, but maybe Carl Peters does--he's on
this list; and I'll ask bill when I see him today.

Actually, I had that new Bond movie in mind.  Maybe Elmore Leonard over
J. Krantz though.  By the way.  There are ways to challenge that don't rely
on the formal vomitorium many poets turn to for inspiration these days.  But
you've got to find that out on your own.

so dale, you mean theatre, like spice world and titanic? - and novels,
like judith krantz and um, cold mountain, yeah?

this isnt cultural snobbery per se, to be asking for something that asks
more of the reader (always, collaborator)  than a passive affirmation of
usual structures of seeing/doing/thinking/going about one's day (ie,
falling in love with oneself/'the poet' - dont know about you, but i never
had a 'poet' write love to me, in fact, i'm almost always the only one
doing the reading! - go figure)

'writer should give enough to move thought and feeling through ...' - tell
me what thought is, what feeling is, how a writer (moxley? dale smith?)
puts something down that reaches that ultimate, indefinable, unmarked
territory of universal emotion - and i have an mfa program to sell

Subject:      The ten gallon hat
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

Emerging now from last night's post-game funk and can finally speak.
My class early this morning was an utter disaster: I started crying
in the middle of a lecture on topic sentences. How will I face them
now tomorrow? I feel like Clinton.

Anyway, last night I drove up to Monroe, Wisconsin with my foam
Cheesehead hat to watch the game at Baumgartner's, a true "bar bar"
with all kinds of fish and animals grinning from the walls and not a
fern plant in sight. Drank about 15 Diet Cokes. But the reason
I'm writing, and it's a stunner, is this: During the second quarter
sometime, a portly man, fortyish, in ten gallon hat, bellied up
next to me and we got to doing the bonding thing by shouting at the
TV through the drunken din. DID YOU SEE THAT?! AW BULLSHIT,
COME ON REF! GO DORSEY GO! and so on. At halftime I introduced
myself, and he to me. Imagine my surprise when he grabbed my hand and
yelled in my ear, HI, I'M TIM WOOD, FROM TEXAS!

I sized him up for a spell, probably cross-eyed with the shock,
and then yelled back as loud as I could, ARE YOU THE SAME TIM WOOD
FROM POETICS LISTSERV?

WHAT'S THAT AGAIN PARDNER? he yelled.

I SAID, I yelled, ARE YOU THE SAME TIM WOOD FROM POETICS
LISTSERV? (Only now does it occur to me that I yelled this twice with
a huge piece of foam cheese on my head, and the thought of myself
in that act strikes me, frankly, as somewhat disturbing.)

NO, he yelled, I'M FROM TEXAS...WACO, TEXAS... ON BUSINESS.

Anyway, the misunderstanding was a bit awkward (in those
non-verbal bar-like ways you can't quite put your finger on), and it
sort of short-circuited the visceral flow of our manly camaraderie.
By the third quarter, he had pulled back from the bar to yell at the
TV with other cheeseheads, and to leave me pondering over the utterly
wild coincidence of it all.

Tim, feel free to post this rather bizarre anecdote on the Texas
Poets Listserv as well!

the Pack will be back,

Kent

No, Steve, we're not planning a publication based on the exhibit; but I
can tell you about the recent issue of Capilano Review featuring bill
bissett. It's Series 2, No. 23, Fall 1997. Here are the contents:

Introduction by editor Robert Sherrin; "th pome wuz a storee. . ." by
Jamie Reid; "nowun duz it like yu," David McFadden interviews bill
bissett; "A Just Measure: breath, line, body in the work of bill bissett,"
by Sharon Nelson; "'when we get there can I smoke?'" by Susan Musgrave;

The Capilano Review
2055 Purcell Way
North Vancouver, B.C. Canada V7J 3H5

Subscriptions are $25/year ($30 for institutions). No evidence of a single
issue price, but they are sold on magazine stands; maybe $12? No
indication of an e-mail address or fax number either.

P.S. the full title of Jamie Reid's essay is "th pome wuz a storee nd is
th storee: th erlee daze uv blewointment." Blewointment was bill's
self-propelled press for twenty years or so.

Best,

Charles

Joe -

- I liked the way your message addressed the delicate ground between
the compellingly urgent and the creepily personal -

The visual art discussion was great, especially for its passion
and negativity. It seems a very useful function of the list to bring
together the anthropologists and their "targets" - so to speak. And very
interesting when we question those roles as of course is happening in
actual anthropology. It feels and sometimes is a life-and death matter who
gets included or discluded - whether you have insurance or not -

And yet, writers' versions of their own histories, poetics and context are
often good reading, but are sometimes related only tangentially to what is
actually out there -

What is new - What are the uses of the new and how work will be relevant
to anyone in 50 or 100 years (or in 5) will not be determined by the same
qualities that make certain poetries or poets dominant now. It's the
Tennyson/Thomas Higginson syndrome -

(This btw not an attack on Ron (I haven't seen his Philly talk)  whose
work I continue to find useful - though it is often in a state of
resistance or exasperation that I may be using it -)

To respond to Karen Kelley (who I have been trying to backchannel with no
luck) about web or print I think that they should exist in tandem and that
web, being easy, instant access (once you have it at all) - leads you to
the print work of the writer(s) - I see non partly as a series of
advertisement for the writers in it- I like it that the access is
international and random - You don't have to standing in SPD as I am
luckily able to to see new work by Bob Grenier or Mary Burger -

I will be doing an interview on the radio possibly with others in the AVEC
anthology reading (which is next Saturday the 31st at CleanWellLighted

McLaughlin, George Albon and Stephen-Paul Martin -)

The radio thing (very immediate Bay Area) is 1220 AM KBBA (I think) at
4:30 on this Wednesday (the 28th) - I promise to mention all of your names
-

Anyone owing me (or having) a review etc for non should get in touch -I
have lost some messages in changing emails -


My new address is lmoriarty@hotmail.com - Will resubscribe as soon as I
can figure out how to filter the list with eudora

The sublime non will be up ASAP

This is one of the central, uncanny things about writing, & like most important
things it's probably best not to talk about it. I'm sure all you talkers

Just a note to say that Notre Dame Review #5 is out, with a new 20-page
poem from Robert Creeley, an interview with Susan Howe, some surprising
art by Janet Bloch, a Simic poem and more, including the second part of
an article on Irish experimental poetry by yours truly (deals with work
by Catherine Walsh, Maurice Scully, and Geoffrey Squires).  Steve
Tomasula of the Electronic Book Review is working on a new web site to
accompany the issue which should be up soon at

Lots of  posts to answer, which I'll do rather hurriedly 'cause I AM
getting a little tuckered, especially from repeating my few main points,
and from trying to keep from becoming de-focused.

Harold R. starts things off for the day by wondering about "all this
talk about Perloff's adequate or inadequate course on visual poetry."
Answer: all the talk from me is because the course is symptomatic of the
Whole World's Indifference (sob) to a kind of poetry I believe in--or,
to be a little more fair--a large chunk of a kind of poetry I believe
in; also--I'll confess it now--because Perloff's seminar presents a good
excuse to publicize that kind of poetry (just as the announcements of
the readings done in conjunction with the seminar publicized
Perloff's brand of poetry; also, finally, for the wonderfully pure
reason that one should always protest anything one conceives as unfair,
however small.

The rest of Harold's first post on this today was interesting but
peripheral.  For instance, that I should spend time on defining
Perloff's role rather than her course is an interesting idea, but I
consider myself a literary critic, not a poetics sociologist.  And I do
consider her important.  I truly wonder where Ashbury would be, for
instance, if not for Vendler.  I'm sure he would eventually have
emerged, but not as quickly.  And it seems to me that Perloff has been
one of the main forces behind language poetry's emergence.  As for the
best way to make a space in the culture of one's time for one's kind of
art, I have no idea what it is.  I personally have always been extremely
private: do the work and let others do the work of finding their way to
it.  But I more and more think that's doing only half your job as an
artist--if you want to communicate--and I do.

Oh, and I don't see the academy as anywhere near the cutting edge, or
that it necessarily should be.  But it should at least acknowledge the
existence of all segments of the cutting edge.

Now, briefly, to Henry Gould, which means wandering far afield.  Only to
TIME magazine and the like is "the cutting edge of biology," in Henry's
words, "the cloning of human beings as objects of scientific curiosity &
ambition."  The media no more provides data about real biologists than
it does about real poets.

Another brief comment, this in response to Carl Lynden Peters, with whom
I tend to agree that working from within the academy is as good a way to
go as any.  And I'm a natural anti-academic who only started college in
his thirties because the government paid him to do so through the GI
Bill, and who never got further than a BA.  Of course, as a substitute
teacher at a high school, I'm now pretty academic.

Great that bissett is getting some recognition.  I think it helps make
him available, period.  I don't care what boundaries others try to put
him in so long as they make him available.  Read/view his work for what
it is, not where it's put by others, including me.

I was pleased to see Maria's quietly sensible post, quite a nice
contrast to some of the outbursts this thread has been seeing, including
some of mine.  I was amused that Mark Prejsnar found something to attack
in it, though--unless he was being comic.

Joe Amato was, as always, reasonably reasonable, but he believes (I
think) in a density of fair play I'm incapable of; that is, I can't help
but point out what I take to be defects regardless of the motives,
compensating virtues, problems with logistics, etc. of the person
responsible for the defects.

Finally, turning to Bill Howe, what can I say?   Except that he should
be shot for making a better case for my view than I've been able to.

Joe:  Read your rant and found myself empathetic with it, with this one
difference: I'm not as pissed off as I used to be.  This is what happens when
the imperialist paradigm is in force; the need to have a hierarchy, hence the
ridiculous banter on the network that crystallizes around the one subject that
everybody's hip to -- getting published.  The truth of the matter has nothing
to do with publishing per se; anyone can publish, if only a vanity press.  No,
here too the hierachical condition exerts itself; it's not IF one publishes
but WHO one is published by.  I'm not saying there isn't a genuine love of the
art out here, I'm saying that it's subordinate to the institutional demand for
honors and a big publishing house.

outcome of such a "crystallization" on-line in FlashPoint Magazine

Maria,
        I don't care whether you have a 'unified point'--you have a good one.
Or, as Rodney King said,...
        Why shouldn't Perloff foreground her favorite authors working in vizpo?
[OK: Bob has a point: perhaps she shouldn't present it as the definitive
& comprehensive course on vizpo--but I suspect she has enough sense not
to, & wouldn't register much surprise if she acknowledges Bob's
objections in her course; why not? She seems pretty fairminded to me,
and a great champion of many of the subscribers to this list].
        As neither a 'language poet' nor a 'visual poet,' I haven't much stake
in this brouhaha, perhaps [?], but _as_ a [godawful obscure] poet,
I sure hope this sniping dies down before someone gets hurt.

Subject:      HUBRISTIC, SIMPLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF VIZPO NEEDS COUNTERING
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

The following passage, from UNENDING DESIGN: THE FORMS OF POSTMODERN POETRY,
Joseph M. Comte (Ithaca: Cornell U. Press, 1991), p. 16, seems simplistic and
therefore provocative, especially to those of us who know little about
"visual" and "sound" poetry.  I'd love to hear some responses to this passage,
as it seems unnecessarily one-dimensional to me.  Anyone interested?

"The concept of a poetic form must respond to the conditions of the modern
world and to an understanding of how that world functions.  Not all "new"
verse forms are equal to the task of confronting reality.  Poets may correctly
observe that theirs is a printed medium requiring the extended concentration
of the reader; and they may also observe that the audiovisual media that now
dominate our culture offer an almost instant gratification that barely
requires the attention of its audience at all.  Thus some poets have devoted
their energies to producing concrete or "visual poetry" that could easily be
flashed on a video monitor, or they have composed "sound poetry" that can be
chanted like a mantra, recorded, spliced, or broadcast over loudspeakers in
some public forum.  But in my opinion such poetic forms seem too much to bear
the stamp of their reality.  They are formal effects that seem not so much
devised by the poet as thrust upon him by the exigencies of his condition.
They reflect a world that has grown too impatient to tolerate the
"defamiliarization," the increase in the "difficulty and length of perception"
that Victor Shklovsky argued poetic language ought to pursue.  Such forms do
not confront or interpret contemporary reality; they submit to it."

Well done Bill. As one who has traded many quips and folded many bits of
paper and fused hips in front of computer monitors and trucked over to
Joel's house to do more of the same--with Joel and Bill and others I _can_
relate to _materiality_ and all the staring and listening it takes to
really _see_ and _hear_ and _make_ poetry not merely visual but real.
Something.

But the meism of this debate gets tiring after a while. No one has really
come out and said why vizpo matters, if it does. For meikal and bob the
answer is implicit in their years and years of work. It's hardly for them
to say. As Pound used to say to a young McLuhan: "all the answers to your
questions are in the first 80 Cantos." Others genuinely wonder, as Joel
says, what the fuss is about.

I read much of the growling and pissing, the territoriality that has come
to the fore, as a symptom of something worth pursuing in a less ad homenim
way because there is a real difference at stake between langpo and the
concertistes which explains meikal, bob and company's irritation at the two
being conflated in Marjorie Perloff's syllabus.

Aside from the absurd implication that a langpod can't be a vizpot (_Veil_
is as worthy a part of the vizpot corpus as anything), there is the
question of what separates the two modes of writing. And I would use this
rift to raise exactly that question. The term materiality (or some
derivative thereof) has been used to describe the work of both the langpods
and the vizpots.

In some usages, notably that of Dale Smith's rabid attacks, materiality
seems to connote decadance, a kind of super-literariness that entails a
high quotient of reflexivity and dialectical highjinx (pace Silliman,
Watten, Bernstein). This I would situate as a kind of dialectical
materialism in which the material of the poem is the result of putting an
obscenely wide lens in front of the poet's gaze on things. This practice
explodes (for one) the notion that the work of the poet is one of selection
and subtle taste in the fine matters of living. I would cite Ron Silliman's
work of the _Ketjak_ _Tjanting_ period where anything can and does pass
through the poem (shitting, waiting for the bus, eating, fucking, etc.).
There is the poem's indiscriminate preoccupation with matter as a site of
poetic possibility and there is an ironic residue of decadence to that, a
Duchampian decadence. I qualify this as dialectical because, in addition to
this preoccupation with materiality, there is the supplemental dimension of
what is at stake in putting that kind of raw, unformed material IN A POEM.
There is paradoxically an extremely high degree of consciousness in that
kind of work, the same high degree of consciousness that informs Duchamps
ready-mades; as brute and bold gestures, they are nonetheless extremely
sophisticated.

There are those that believe Duchamp challenged the sanctity of art with
his ready-mades. I believe he did the opposite, he reinforced it, for the
same reason that the langpods extending the limits of the poem reinforces
that sanctity of the poem as a capacious entity (kinda like Walt Whitman).
So you can call that materiality of you want; I regard it as an infusion of
matter into the ever-virtual sphere of the poem. Nothing wrong with that in
the least, as long as we remember that it is a nominal materiality that is
at work there.

Materiality in poetry SHOULD mean works that brush up against the limits
not of _the poem_ but of the real. That is what the best concrete vizpot
does. It does not thematize matter; it challenges the audience to view
letters and words as real things with a domension and duration all their
own, not merely as indices in an overdetermined virtual world of meaning.

There is great beauty and courage in work that is willing to forsake the
readymade structure of phonetic literacy and put letters in the service of
creating spaces and temporalities that outstrip anything the alphabet was
designed to contain and control.

I salute meikal and bob and all the other concretists on this list for
their work. I got my eye on you.

It's late (for me) my salt bath is ready. Grind on.

Luigi, Henry, and

     [If I have the time this might be a series of short posts rather than
a long post, particularly as I am thinking it through as I write.]

     I may be writing here more as a psychologist than a poet (and I am
working from a psychhologist's - Marion Milner's - words.  She is a
psychologist but writing here as a painter so I'm not sure "words" is
accurate), but it does seem to me that any new direction or movement
in poetry will not be in the area of form or language. The Russians
recently mentioned here and the vizpo business seem to support this -
I think the importance of vizpo is in its visual dimension rather than
its forms - this might be what is problematic in a langpo approach to
vizpo.

I. Langpo (or whatever) has opened to clear the detrius in what was
accepted as the way it is.

II.  The next "movement" will not be one of style or new "avants", but...

                           I.

     "It seemed it was possible...to have evaded facing certain facts
about the human situation, or only given a superficial acquiescence
to them.  Otherwise why was it so difficult to feel about, as well as
think about, the separateness or togetherness of objects?...Direct
sensory was always fragmentary and had to be combined into a whole by
the creative imagination....even the perception of a...carrot was an

Luigi-
>a number of momement/movements that have, if not
crystallized, at least been strong confluxes of poetic/community energies...
one significant difference, as i've suggested before, is th lack of critical/
theoretic attentions either frm within or outside...  ov course, such
attentions/components are sometimes held as markers of "seriousness"
(as if, lacking overt critical discourse, there is no critcal thought or
>theoretic underpinning)

Henry
>"movements" themselves have a certain "synthetic, teleological"
energy...Again, I insist that the really great art releases something
via a synthetic process in which the rational or strategic will is in
abeyance rather than control.  Or at least "in collaboration"...
anything that critiques "the way things are" is justified as "art".
I think we are all familiar with this trend in the arts.

By suggesting a socio-political explanation for why a "new crystallization"
on a par with language poetry has not yet occurred, Ron is following this
trend. & I would argue that the answer to his question - where a new
development is to be found - has already been supplied earlier in the
dialogue; by Ron himself, when he talks about all art as a "tuning of the
senses" via an overdetermination, if you will, of stimulae; and by Jeff,
when he argues that the political impact of estrangement is not supplied
so much by disjunction as by "radical _conjunction_" - the JOINING of
dangerous taboo political contexts within the energy of clear artistic
description (& Derksen uses examples from Silliman's own work to illustrate).

I would argue that an aesthetic of pure critique, not firmly grounded in
artistic processes, ends up one-sided and rhetorical.  As I suggested in
a previous post, art is a kind of uncanny energy which spins out of the
artist's full control but brings joy in the process - a joy which spreads
& subsumes critique & re-orients everything in its path.  This is Whitman's
daemonic Laugh coming from the Rockies. It becomes a super-synthesis of
speech/drawing/voice/gesture - not a move-in-reaction to previous trends
but a kind of perennial activity.  It is with such a synthetic approach,
giving full weight to the artistic process in itself, which I would posit
the current generation is already engaged & which could be "crystallized"
in recognizable academic-literary-historical format suitable for framing

"Granted that poetic language draws attention to itself more than nonpoetic=
=20
language, one must make a stylistic distinction between poetic styles in=20
which this is more, and those in which this is less conspicuous. In=20
non-manneristic styles, classic or romantic for example, the transition=20
from the signifiant to the signifi=E9 is relatively smooth, in spite of all.=
=20
The phonetic patterns in these styles are perceived as some pleasant=20
fusion of sounds in the back of one's mind. In manneristic styles, such as
metaphysical or modernistic poetry, language tends to direct attention=20
back to the signifiers more conspicuously. To put my
argument briefly, in poetic language we are more aware of the=20
separateness of the signs than in nonpoetic language; and within
poetic language, we are more aware of their separateness in manneristic=20
than in, e.g., romantic poetry.=20

"We listen to a stream of abstract phonetic categories, made amenable to the
resolving power of the human ear by parallel transmission. At the same time,=
=20
at a lower level, and subliminally, we may attend to the rich,=20
precategorial acoustic information, which may affect the perceived quality=
=20
of poetic language in a variety of ways.
For our present business, one thing is important: there is a subtle=
 interplay=20
in the background, on a very minute scale, between
this rich, precategorial acoustic information and the fine-grained semantic=
=20
components. Obviously, owing to the differences
propounded above, such interplay cannot take place between the visual=20
design superimposed upon the line arrangement and
the patterns of signs at the phonetic, semantic, syntactic and thematic=
 levels.=20

"Some contemporary critics hold, following Dr. Johnson, that blank verse and=
=20
vers libre are "often only verse for the eye". This is a
misconception. Just as the graphic arrangement on the page presents the=20
lines as perceptual units to the eye, the intonation
contours heard in the reading of poetry present the lines as perceptual=
 units=20
to the ear. Such contours are the result of the
interaction of the intonation contours required by prose rhythm with those=
=20
that articulate the line. It is assumed that the listener
decodes these contours in terms of the intonation contours from whose=20
interplay they arise. In fact, the main function of the
graphic arrangement on the page is to give the reader instructions=20
concerning the intonation contours appropriate to the lines.
In this respect, the verse lines with the white space around become rather=
=20
transparent graphic signs of phonological entities:
just as the letters on the page signal phonemes, the verse lines surrounded=
=20
by white space signal intonation contours (cf. Tsur,
1977: 119; 1992 a: 174-175). They only begin to compete for the reader's=20
attention and reassert their warring identity, when
they are foregrounded by some "mannerist" device: acrostic, or some mimetic
arrangement.=20

"I propose to offer a model alternative to Tynjanov's, drawn from Sypher=20
(1955: 6), who speaks of four stages of Renaissance
style, the first two of which are relevant to our present business: A
provisional=20
formulation (Renaissance), and a disintegration
(Mannerism). We might suggest that in the first stage, that of the=
 "provisional=20
formulation", the art-consumer (reader, listener,
spectator) tends to attend away from the individual devices to the=
 architecture=20
of the whole, whereas in the second stage he is
forced to attend back to the isolated devices, with possible serious damage=
 to=20
the architectural structure of the whole. In
Melchiori's phrasing (1966: 138), "the total effect is frequently lost sight=
=20
of, or is reached through accumulation rather than
through a harmonious disposition of structural parts", whereas "details are=
=20
worked out with a goldsmith's care". A similar
disintegration has been observed by Curtius (1973: 274) toward the end of=
 the=20
Latin Middle Ages: "A danger of the system
lies in the fact that, in manneristic epochs, the ornatus is piled on=20
indiscriminately and meaninglessly. In rhetoric itself, then, lies
concealed one of the seeds of Mannerism. It produces a luxuriant growth in=
=20
Latin Middle Ages". A similar story can be told,
mutatis mutandis, about the disintegration of romanticism, after a=20
provisional formulation, into the ensuing various types of
mannerism.=20

"The discontinuity of manneristic devices in general, and of picture poems=
=20
in particular, throughout the history of literature, can
be accounted for, then, by a model suggesting an internal dynamics of=20
alternating periods of provisional formulation and of
disintegration, in which "the centre cannot hold".


"There seems to be general consensus as for the artificiality of the=
 graphemic=20
patterning of picture poems, as compared to the
relative naturalness of the various kinds of phonetic patterning prevalent=
=20
in all kinds of poetry. But only very few people do ask
why graphemic patterning should be less natural than phonetic patterning;=20
and even fewer people give an answer to this
question based on Liberman's findings concerning the unique nature of=20
speech. It should be noticed that Liberman's conception
is tailor-made for explaining this relative unnaturalness. At the same=20
time, the general consensus as for the relative
unnaturalness of graphemic patterning might serve as weighty evidence in=20
favour of Liberman's conception of speech
perception, as opposed to the received view.=20




"I still owe an explanation why mannerism tends to occur during "periods=20
of great social, political and ideological upheaval, when more than one=20
scale of values prevail". I have elsewhere discussed at considerable=20
length (e.g., Tsur, 1987: chapter 9; 1992 a: chapter 15), the cognitive=20
functions fulfilled by such typical metaphysical devices as the=20
metaphysical pun and conceit, and used these functions in an effort=20
to explain the effects of those devices on the readers. The gist of=20
my argument is that the metaphysical pun and the metaphysical conceit=20
are adaptive devices turned to an aesthetic end. In a socio-cultural
situation in
which disintegration exceeds the degree that could be handled by cognitive=
=20
integrating devices deployed by e.g. romanticism,
one must cope with emotional disorientation by resorting to some more=
 effective=20
adaptive devices. As a first orientation device, one might check whether=
 one's=20
adaptation mechanisms are properly tuned. When one is shocked out of tune=
 with
one's environment by the clashing emotional tendencies of the grotesque, of=
=20
the metaphysical pun, or of the metaphysical conceit then, as suggested by
Sypher,=20
one tries to readjust himself so as to regain aesthetic distance. In the
course of this, our
own coping mechanisms with the environment, and especially the linguistic=20
mechanisms involved in this process, become perceptible to ourselves. Some
similar=20
process of disorientation and readjustment may be at work when the reader
attempts to
integrate the visual design superimposed upon the verse lines with the rest
of the poem,=20
at least in the most extreme instances.

         Abstract

This paper explores some cognitive and aesthetic principles concerning=
 picture
poems. It conceives of language as of a hierarchy of signs: the graphemic=
 string
signifies a phonological string which signifies units of meaning which
signify referents
in extralinguistic reality. Our linguistic competence urges us to reach the
final
referents as fast as possible. Poetic language draws attention to itself,
that is, to the
hierarchy of signifiers. In manneristic styles there is a greater awareness
of the
separateness of signifiers than in non-manneristic styles; hence their witty=
 or
disorienting effect. While rhyme, metre, alliteration impose additional
patterning upon
the phonological signifiers, picture poems, acrostich, and some other
manneristic
devices impose additional patterning upon the graphemic signifiers. When
alliterations are turned into puns, they become manneristic patterning of=
 the
phonological signifier. It is argued, by analogy with synaesthesia, that=
 stable
characteristic visual shapes obstruct smooth perceptual fusion; and based on
speech
perception, that speech sounds are special in our cognitive economy, and=
 visual
patterning cannot achieve the naturalness of their patterning. That is why
visual
patterning is not admitted in non-manneristic styles. Cognitive poetics
suggests that
in the response to poetry, adaptive devices are turned to an aesthetic end.=
 In a
universe in which "the centre cannot hold", readers of poetry find pleasure
not so
much in the emotional disorientation caused by mannerist devices, but rather
in the
reassertion that their adaptive devices, when disrupted, function properly.
This is one
reason for mannerist styles to recur in cultural and social periods in which
more than
one scale of values prevail.

I feel like Alice in Wonderland--curiouser and curiouser--as I read these
posts about "my" seminar, mostly totally speculative.

All the sinister things attributed to me and to the course seem to have
nothing to do with reality.  So here's a little reality check, gang.

the Stanford English dept, as Maria, a star graduate well knows, is not
given to having many grad courses in poetry:  mostly it might be Pound &
Eliot, sometimes (Al Gelpi), Black Mountain, sometimes (gil
Sorrentino)--Williams and very occasionally the Objectivists.  John
Felstiner teaches courses that include Lowell, Bishop, etc.

There has never been a course in visual poetry, concrete poetry, sound
poetry or any thing similar in the 10 years I've been here.  Most of my
colleagues don't know what "concrete poetry" is, never mind post-concrete,
materialist poetics, or any related item.  One of them asked me what an
artist's book is.

In these circumstances--quite typical, by the way--I thought it might be
fun to organize a course that would stress the visual elements in poetry
and look at some of the new work.  So I picked representative texts from
Apollinaire and Pound on down, beginning with the CALLIGRAMMES and Pound's
ideograms.  I could have easily picked 10 alternate lists.  For instance:
I'm sorry I'm not doing Duchamp whose visual poetics are very important to
me.  I picked Darren Werschler-Henry because I think NICKELODEON is an
exciting, innovative book but I might just as well have picked Christian
Bok's CRYSTALLOGRAPHY, which I love.  I chose books that I find
interesting.  I do think as the professor, that's my right.  Courses are
not advocacy forums but designed to TEACH.

So who is Bob Grumman to tell me my course is not REALLY about visual
poetics?  What does this mean?  If Bob teaches a course than obviously he
can choose his texts.  He might not choose the OUT OF EVERYWHERE anthology
which I love (and which certainly has visual poems in it--see the Diane
Ward, for example) and that would be his privilege.  But obviously any
course is personal; there's no such thing as "coverage".

I hope this is the end of this thread because I find it so
counterproductive.  And also coercive:  how can anyone tell anyone else
what works they should/must teach?

Somebody here was expressing how the novel continued to have an audience
(ditto theater), while poetry was becoming progressively more isolated.

I want to say hogwash. Last time I checked, there was still just one novel
being published for every 6,000 written (compute that into human effort for
a moment), and most novels sell about as well as a book of poems -- under
200 copies. BUT there is an upper end possibility and of course the ever-
present potential of "optioning" the book to Hollywood. Out of how many
novels published, how many get to be part of Oprah's book club?

That is why somebody like Kathy Acker, writing and self-publishing her early
books a chapter every month, seems so startlingly heroic, even 25 years
later. It's far better I think to decide to write well and worry about the
genre and "acceptance" after.

Recent examples of same would be, say, the Letters of Mina Harker or Laura
Moriarty's stunning fiction Cunning.

The conjunction of Scott Pound & Tom Bell's posts (2 people actually agree
on something on this list?) re: "vizpo" is interesting.  The appeal of
the physical hieroglyph, not assimilable into a virtual reality of
structured information (Our World Today) is understandable; is it sort
of like the romantic's ruin or fragment?  or like the imagist's image,
taken to its futurist limit.

a book I just bumped into that might be of interest is Vincent Sherry's
_Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and radical modernism_ (Oxford UP, 1993);
I haven't read it but it seems to hinge on a concept of the visual
as in opposition to the aural.  (I guess this was one of Lewis's big ideas.)

Tom Bell's psychological angle seems important too.  Think of Olson's
focus on the physical local in front of his eyes as a "clue" (fragment,
ruin, unassimilable matter) - a thread, a nail, leading to the "resolution"
of the mystery.  Within the mesmerizing charisma or strange attraction
of the poetic field.  I think these movement-building sturm & struts
need to remember that perhaps the most absolute unassimilable fragment
is the individual experience of the artist; what is
mesmerizing about the field and what is compelling about the fragment
is not its pure materiality or even its unassimilableness but the
fact that it beckons TOWARD assimilation - it's a clue; and maybe only
a clue to beauty. (a beauty that may, gosh, end up being political too.)

Fragments & collages are always in-relation with the forms & correlations
they deny/adumbrate.  Dere iz no ezcape four hyou, hyou arr unter mie

"It's far better I think to decide to write well..."

That is the problem with poets and novelists.  Still, as a popular form, novels
      maintain an element of respect and a sense of accesability.  Poetry
does not have the same cultural place.  It appears elitist and out of touch
in ways that challenging and difficult novels don't.  Toni Morrison and T.
Pynchon manage to sell books that are well received.  I think because of their
historical and ethical examinations they tap a vein of interest in the
public.  Regardless, there is a demand for novels, not for poetry.  I think
the rows and rows of novels at Barnes and Nobles, not to mention those
hideous cartoons of dead writers, reveal the way in which the book industry
is responding to this demand.  Of course, those publishers are confused,
because they don't know what to sell and novelists aren't doing a much better
job than poets.  Still, it's Content that will engage.  Not formal, lamrof,
mrfoal, lamrof challenge.  Expedient execution of subject matter is key. Dale.

Take everyone interested in poetry in this society--say those who know the
name of a single living poet. This is a small percentage, surely.

Now reduce the number to those whose interest in poetry is more
sigificant--they might actually own a few books and follow the work of a
few poets--a somewhat smaller percentage.

Now take those, within this already small group, whose interest is
primarily in experimental or avant-garde work; language poetry and the
like.  What percentage of the above percentage are we talking about?
Judging by the poetry selection at the local border's, this will be a low
number.

Now take from this group those whose interests are further specialized,
say, the devotees of visual poetry.  A somewhat smaller sub-group, to say
the least.  As the number of people decreases, the frustration
understandably mounts.  The middle-brow poetry fans have their Bill Moyers
and Donald Hall, while we must be contented with Marjorie Perloff, who at
least places this work into a more public discourse via the academy.

What is my point? I am just trying to provide a somewhat broader
perspective.  That "noone listens to poetry" is the underlying problem
here.  This does not diminish its value or significance--but neither is
this value in inverse proportion to its audience.

This is a reply to Marjorie Perloff's deft post.

1.  My remarks about Marjorie Perloff's seminar were not speculative but
based on the syllabus she sent me.  That syllabus indicated what poets
she was having visit her class, what poets each class was supposed to be
about, and what books and other data-sources she thought her students
might find useful.  I'm sure her seminar is covering more than that, and
bravo if it actually touches on the group of people I've been so
repetitiously claiming she is ignoring.

2.  Marjorie Perloff is to be commended for being far in advance of the
great majority of other English professors in the country regarding the
newer poetries.  That should not put her beyond criticism.

3. As I've said before, I agree that college courses are "not advocacy
forums but designed to TEACH."  The problem is, as Marjorie Perloff must
know, that they also serve implicitly as advocacy forums; they
explicitly act as accessibility-granting, publicizing forums.
Furthermore, Marjorie Perloff's course is only one, but among the first
college courses devoted to visual poetry, and since she is a big name
teaching it at a bigtime college like Stanford, there is a more than
slight possibility that it will serve as a model for others.  It will
also tend to influence what goes into the anthologies of the future,
which I consider important.  Such anthologies are what makes work
available to be discovered.

4.  I doubt that I ever said or implied that I didn't think Marjorie
Perloff's course was "REALLY about visual poetics," only that it covered
a lot less of the field than I felt it ought to.  Why would it have hurt
her to add five or ten titles of books by visual poets she finds
uninteresting to her list of twenty or thirty or more supplementary
materials?  She could have protected her reputation for knowing the good
from the bad by noting that she thinks little of them but that perhaps
one or two of her students might get something out of them.  If I taught
a course in visual poetry or poetics, I would emphasize much different
poets than Marjorie Perloff is--but I would not ignore her favorites
altogether.  I would definitely have works by a reasonable number of
them on any list of supplementary data-sources I listed.

5. Finally, I've all along NOT been telling Marjorie Perloff what to
teach, only what to at least mention the existence of.

Thanks to Aviva for posting something about visual poetry that I suspect
Marjorie Perloff would agree with me on.  If the passage Aviva quotes
from Joseph M. Comte's UNENDING DESIGN: THE FORMS OF POSTMODERN POETRY
alleging that visual poets are competing with sound bites is
representative of his over-all view of contemporary visual poetry, he
needs a lot of help.  The passage is also stupid for dealing with the
presumed motives of some (unnamed or exemplified) poets rather than
their actual work.  It's not worth further attention.

I'm glad to see, by the way, that the threads on vizpo are now so
active, and contain so much of interest--besides all the annoying
mess-up-your-opponent debating tactics instead of addressing issues.
There are now too many posts for me to deal with.  I'm also getting worn
out, I have to admit.  I did want to throw in one reaction to a post
whose sender I now forget: it is that I don't think many people in
visual poetry see it as any next step forward from language poetry but
as a series of steps begun some time before language poetry, and
continuing, unremarked-upon, simultaneously with language poetry
(cross-fertilizing with it from time to time).

That's all from me, probably for the rest of the day.  --Bob

Subject:      Re: Perloff debate

I AM SO SORRY to write TOO MUCH to this list.  I am a list hog. Nevertheless
another brief wooden nickel on this issue.

People jump on Grumman for criticizing Perloff's syllabus.  Who is immune
from criticism?  The academy IS powerful.  It's a machine.  Marjorie
Perloff is a friend of poetry because she has a gusto for new, experimental
writing.  That is just terrific, no doubt about it.  But let's look
at the "down side".  Isn't there something of a conflict of interest,
a sort of nepotism, for a working scholar-critic to promote the work
of living artists who ALSO depend on the academy for readings, jobs,
fellowships & the like?  Perloff of course is not alone.  Nor is poetry
alone (this happens in all the arts, I guess).  I don't want to pick on
anybody, especially for getting into contemporary work.  But where
do you draw the line between criticism and blurbs?  I thought avant-garde
meant challenging.  The best way to be challenging is to challenge
yourself.  By standing on your own 2 feet.  No cozy relationships,
no buddy-buddy, no easy praise, no networking, no po-biz, no
bullshit.  That's the ideal.  It requires a modicum of silence,
exile & cunning, doesn't it?  HOW MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS A
SMALL PRESS VERSION OF THE NAME GAME?  (get out your flagellation-
cat o'nines, everybody) (the only absolution is to actually look into
some stuff, get into it, read it, understand it, research it, dig into it)

CALL FOR WORK -- SMALL PRESS COLLECTIVE

A loosely defined group of editors gathered around a website have been
charged collectively with seeking work for a new online publication
space. There are many fine examples of such web-publishing and THE SMALL
PRESS COLLECTIVE hopes to add to that. Each editor controls a section of
the site and there may be overlap as well as divergence of interest,
between editors and within editors. I don't think any of the other
editors are on this list, except Graham and myself, although Taylor
Brady might be. So this is a public call for submissions to this forum.
Eventually there will be a paper edition, excerpting from the on-line
work.

What I'm hungry to find:

Criticism in the vein of BAD SUBJECTS, a e-zine collective based in
Berkeley, I believe. That would be politically and social relevant
criticism about popular culture, theory, etc.

Criticism in the GOOD new Formalist vein: readings of texts,
explanations of technological advances in new work by younger writers,
or new work by older writers. These readings can/should be value-laden.

Criticism in a classic Materialist sense: readings of texts should
invoke all of the attendant norms of dialectical materialist critical
behavior, or inaddendant abnorms...

Creative Writing: poetry, journal entries, fiction, non-fiction creative
essays. Writing must be written with words and written by a person. No
found poems puhleeze! [writing is defined as text files]

Art Work: pictures of all sorts. Pictures may be abstract or
representational and must be considered artwork by the artist. [art is
defined here as .gif or .jpeg files]

Please write to me and tell me before you send work. I will scan artwork
if that is a problem. Work can be sent on disk to my snail address or
sent as an attachment. Text files should be in a pre-6 format for either
Mac or PC, although if that is impossible, please let me know.

please forward this, doc.

so, like, i'm not really completely sure what visual poetry is, though i
have a pretty good idea, is it stuff like concrete poetry?  or like hannah
weiner's WEEKS, as opposed to her We Teach Silent? i guess it's like bob
cobbing, whom cris cheek introduced me to at the XCP conference.   what
about bpNichol, whose Martyrology book 6 i'm looking at for the first time
and adoring?  some is visual some not? was the United States of Poetry
visual poetry cuz it relied so heavily on the visual for its effect?  is
American Sign Language visual poetry cuz you have to See it, not Read or
Hear it?  is kamau brathwaite's later work, where he uses the "sycorax
video style" visual poetry (though not as visual as, say, bob cobbing or r
grenier), whereas the earlier work, which only put "foreign" words in
italics, but in which line breaks (a visual effect) were central to his
overall effect, is *not* visual poetry?  i guess it's like any category
--when you really examine it you see how porous it is, tho there's a
general consensus about what constitutes the critical mass of "vispo"
stuff. or maybe not, no consensus, evidenced by the buzz on this list.

scott pound wrote among other things:
There are those that believe Duchamp challenged the sanctity of art with
his ready-mades. I believe he did the opposite, he reinforced it, for the
same reason that the langpods extending the limits of the poem reinforces
that sanctity of the poem as a capacious entity (kinda like Walt Whitman).
So you can call that materiality of you want; I regard it as an infusion of
matter into the ever-virtual sphere of the poem. Nothing wrong with that in
the least, as long as we remember that it is a nominal materiality that is
at work there.

Materiality in poetry SHOULD mean works that brush up against the limits
not of _the poem_ but of the real. That is what the best concrete vizpot
does. It does not thematize matter; it challenges the audience to view
letters and words as real things with a domension and duration all their
own, not merely as indices in an overdetermined virtual world of meaning... etc

**
this is really interesting and very well put. this is the kind of pithy
insight i love to parade in front of my classes as an example of the heart
of debates around contemp. poetry.  thanks scott.--md

Yes, ANOTHER WORLD-WIDE DECENTRALIZED COMMUNICA-TION PROJECT Is about to be
unlashed on an unsuspecting planet. You waited enough for it, now here it
is, close at hand:

1998: A YEAR OF INCONGRUOUS MEETINGS
in-con-gru-ous adj. (L. incongruus) not congruous
a - lacking harmony or agreement; incompatible.
b - having inconsistent or inharmonious parts, elements, etc.
c - not corresponding to what is right, proper or reasonable; unsuitable;
inappropriate.

You have done the hard work already, congressing and lecturing in 1986,
re-congressing and networking in 1992, so relax: NOW YOU CAN HAVE FUN.

Participation in the IM98 is open and free to all: mailartists, netsurfers,
musicians, shopkeepers, shoplifters, aliens, subgenii, rabbits, rabbis,
you-name-it.
There is not a single sound reason to meet again but there are all the
incongruous reasons in the world, IF YOU CAN JUST THINK UP ONE: so keep
working-sleeping-consuming or FIND A THEME, ORGANIZE AN IM IN 1998 and take
part in as many IM proposed by others as you wish/can.

IT IS AS EASY AS THAT:
organize+participate+document (if you care to),
then send your incongruous documentation to
E.O.N., via C. Battisti 339, 55049 Viareggio, Italy
to be included in a free for all Conclusive IM98 Calendar-Catalog.

Nothing and everything may happen at an Incongruous Meeting, so share
gibberish and memories, follow your ethereal instinct and start a brand new
correspondance.

it goes by six+six+six:
MAC 86  (Mail Art Congress 1986)
+ 6 =
DNC 92   (Decentralized Networker Congress 1992)
+ 6 =
IM 98    (Incongruous Meetings 1998)

So, can we live so far apart for more than 6 years?

DUPLICATE, IMPROVE, REWRITE freely and DISTRIBUTE widely all the texts in
this message.

TRANSLATE and ADJUST the IM98 invite in your own language and CIRCULATE it
in your country.

THE KEY (IS THE FLEA)

a formulaic ode in tractor-trailertylic hexametres

for Marquis Louis Fortinblatt-Hohenzollern du Pwints

"Expedient execution of subject matter is key,"*
quoth splendiferous Louis the 16th to the flea -
aloft in voluminous hammock at Versailles,
fleas under his legs, mosquitoes in the sky,
unable to read LIAISONS DANGEREUSES
for all the nipping at his privateuses.
"Bring me a heavier novel!" cried the King,
unable to withstand said cruel sting
a moment longer.  They brought him DON QUIXOTE,
which forthwith he deployed upon his pinky
(the 3rd) - and thus, expediently, my dear Marquis,
saved France from another flea-bitten monarchy.

also tend to influence what goes into the anthologies of the future,
which I consider important.  Such anthologies are what makes work
available to be discovered."

The assumptions here are pretty big -- that students are like robots, that
they will not become interested in vispo and explore it on their own and
find out more. Also, that courses modeled after Perloff's will take the same
stand.

No doubt that some students will take what they get and leave it, but others
will explore the genre on their own (I know I did with other genres). As far
as future courses and anthologies go, I get the message from Perloff that
resources are slim enough and that she had to go with what she knows.

Let's put some faith in the students and see what happens.

               Poetry's got little to do with anything today.  I'm not
talking about specialized, hermetic stuff.  I'm talking about volume.  The
public.  Mainstream values and perceptions.  Not because I want to cater
to that group, but to acknowledge the real insignificance of poetry compared
to other still vital forms.  I realize that the novel is more adaptable in
a commercial sense, which is really the only sense in which this society
deals with anything.  But poetry used to market itself in vital and pressing
ways.  Not everyone's read the Cantos, but a lot folks know who Pound is.
And Ginsberg. If nothing else, poetry used to make the public uncomfortable.
But poets aren't saying anything worthy of controversy.  So.  Open the NYTimes
review of books and read about the newest from Dildo Dawson.  Yee Haw!

Take everyone interested in poetry in this society--say those who know the
name of a single living poet. This is a small percentage, surely.

Now reduce the number to those whose interest in poetry is more
sigificant--they might actually own a few books and follow the work of a
few poets--a somewhat smaller percentage.

Now take those, within this already small group, whose interest is
primarily in experimental or avant-garde work; language poetry and the
like.  What percentage of the above percentage are we talking about?
Judging by the poetry selection at the local border's, this will be a low
number.

Now take from this group those whose interests are further specialized,
say, the devotees of visual poetry.  A somewhat smaller sub-group, to say
the least.  As the number of people decreases, the frustration
understandably mounts.  The middle-brow poetry fans have their Bill Moyers
and Donald Hall, while we must be contented with Marjorie Perloff, who at
least places this work into a more public discourse via the academy.

What is my point? I am just trying to provide a somewhat broader
perspective.  That "noone listens to poetry" is the underlying problem
here.  This does not diminish its value or significance--but neither is
this value in inverse proportion to its audience.

Henry expresses a laudable - but forgive me for saying so  - naive faith
in the idea of rugged individualism with the quaint phrase "standing on
his own 2 feet." Show me, please, the person who has lived that has done
this and I'll forthwith eat my Bronco jersey. There ain't no such
animal, old chum. Here we are, engaged in this electronic medium of
debate and exchange, subscribing to the attempt to foster a new
expression of poetic community, and against this appears the goofy idea
- the queer utopian notion - of  trying to peddle  the indefiddle as
Island:  monadology rearing its gorgon maw again oh cut it out please.
In my experience, people who proffer the bootstrap theory have very
little real world experience and by that I mean, mixing it up with the
brethern in the business world, the money world, the school world, the
so-called professional world, that is, the world of compromise and
action of which  the field of cultural production is but a part. If
they're at all successful, count on a field of unmarked (i.e.
unacknowledged) graves -

Where do you draw the line between criticism and blurbs is a good
question, though. My answer would be: if it's written by a friend, it's
a blurb; if it's written by a not-friend, it's criticism. It's all a
name game, old thing - merit is the least transparent and translatable
of values, unless you're Terrell Davis, that is. Silence cunning & exile
was the motto of the same writer who kept up a near constant epistolic
litany of demands, entreaties, etc., for the favor of publishers, the
assistance of friends and even used pairs of shoes.

I AM SO SORRY to write TOO MUCH to this list.  I am a list hog.
Nevertheless
another brief wooden nickel on this issue.

People jump on Grumman for criticizing Perloff's syllabus.  Who is
immune
from criticism?  The academy IS powerful.  It's a machine.  Marjorie
Perloff is a friend of poetry because she has a gusto for new,
experimental
writing.  That is just terrific, no doubt about it.  But let's look
at the "down side".  Isn't there something of a conflict of interest,
a sort of nepotism, for a working scholar-critic to promote the work
of living artists who ALSO depend on the academy for readings, jobs,
fellowships & the like?  Perloff of course is not alone.  Nor is poetry
alone (this happens in all the arts, I guess).  I don't want to pick on
anybody, especially for getting into contemporary work.  But where
do you draw the line between criticism and blurbs?  I thought
avant-garde
meant challenging.  The best way to be challenging is to challenge
yourself.  By standing on your own 2 feet.  No cozy relationships,
no buddy-buddy, no easy praise, no networking, no po-biz, no
bullshit.  That's the ideal.  It requires a modicum of silence,
exile & cunning, doesn't it?  HOW MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE DOING IS A
SMALL PRESS VERSION OF THE NAME GAME?  (get out your flagellation-
cat o'nines, everybody) (the only absolution is to actually look into
some stuff, get into it, read it, understand it, research it, dig into
it)

Miekal and all,

I did quickly browse around on netscape and came up with the following:

http://130.179.92.25/canlitx/Framed_Version/CanlitF.html

This is the "framed version" of the Canadian Literature Archive, via the
Canlit homepage from U. Manitoba. The Canlit homepage url is

http://canlit.st-john.umanitoba.ca

If you try the first url and land on the Canlit Archive page, you can
scroll down and click on "Canadian Writers on the Web," scroll down the
other frame past such as David Arnason, Margaret Atwood, Henry Beissel,
etc., till you get to bill. You'll find when you click on his name that a
nice photo appears; the bissett site is under construction, so there
isn't much on him or his work, but more is promised, and they do have
some poems of his on audio if you're set up for sound.

I gather that Dennis Cooley and David Arnason are supervising the
Canadian writers' homepage; you can find e-mail addresses for both if you
want to direct specific questions about the site or specific writers.

Thank you, Patrick, for your post.  I can't quite tell if you're being
ironic, tongue-in-cheek, or not.  But whether or no, I think by
getting it all backwards you go backwards to the heart of things.

Your characterization of the worldly world of "cultural production"
makes me laugh.  Is this what Emily Dickinson meant when she said
Publication = Prostitution, or something to that effect?

I don't know about other people's methods, but when I'm involved
with a poem the idea of having anything venal or collaborative to
do with anybody else is distracting, to say the least.  & I see
the buddy system & po-biz as a positive danger to independence,
standards, and taste.  Doesn't this go for any vocation, just about?
Why is literature any different?  Mandelstam: "there are 2 kinds of
literature, official and unofficial.  The 1st is trash; the 2nd, stolen
air."  Beware that your slimy blurbs eat you alive in the trashbin
of your own making.

Stolen air. This is a definition of poetry.  It's not the "worlds" of
commerce, business, etc. etc. that you mentioned - it's their
sanction or their judge.  (By the way, I consider my fairly broad
experience OUTSIDE the literature game to have its plus & minus
aspects - one of the positive being the armor it provides.  My approach
is not naive whatsoever; actually, I think yours is - if you were
not joking).

It is possible to write poetry, send it to journals & publishers,
write essays, and find friends, allies and supporters, without
sucking up, bullshitting, and betraying your principles.  You may
become a highly-acclaimed false prophet & bad poet eventually -
or you may languish in honest obscurity.  But you don't have to
be a dog.

Maria's mention of bpNichol and her remark that "visual poetry" is like
any category-- when you really examine it you see how porous it is>>
among her other useful comments open up the doors which have been  slammed
shut in all the discussion of marginalization and canon, and for this
I am grateful even if the vizpo thread has carried on for longer than
most.  Much has been said about visual poets, but I would also like to
hear more about artists who use poetry.  Blake and Patchen are obvious
examples, as are so many Chinese painter-poets.  The line of difference
between visual poets and textual artists is not something that I can
draw, though if I were foolish enough to try I would probably start with
the matter of whether Herriman's dialogue balloons in Krazy Kat contain
poems, and then look at Philip Guston's poem-pictures.  In 1994, I was
lucky enough to catch a small exhibit of these at the Addison Gallery in
Andover, Mass.  Don't know if the catalogue from Univ of Washington Press is
still in print, but it rewards repeated thumbing through.  The collaborations
with Clark Coolidge, are especially good, and provide another look at the
obscene materiality of representation which Scott Pound has underlined.
One of my favorite lines in them addresses several issues about writing
alluded to in the vizpo thread:"To draw is to make be/more than one start......"
But alas tapping buttons cannot convey the art of these inscriptions, which
for all their coarsenss hold onto the hand-made grace of Twombly's graffiti.
Are ther other such poem-pictures in which not typography but drawing
predominates?  Perhaps some of the visual poets already named draw their
poems, but would someone be willing to name them again for those of us
not familiary with their work.  The theoretical questions about whether
fonts are drawings, whether collage is a kind of drawing, whether icons
are texts, etc., do not need to be answered in advance of the preliminary
sorting that I am asking for, I hope....though I would find the asking of
such questions at least as interesting and important as the inclusion/exclusion
aspects of the topic.

Rachel,

Yes. I completely agree with you. The Barthes quote was, of course, a
response to two issues on the list:
1. "Where are all the "new" young writers?" and
2. Dale Smith's critiques of langpo

So yes, theoretically, according to Barthes, everyone is "new"--alone,
original. The issue you raise about the glorification of the "original"
writer--of style--is the critique I was hoping to launch against the older
langpo types who criticize young writers for being unoriginal.
        These older thinkers (among them Tuma, Silliman etc) are wanting
something "new" from a group of young writers--perhaps they don't want
new styles, per se, but new politics--
        But even still, I find such demands strange (and hypocritical)
coming from thinkers who claim to believe that poetry should counteract
fascism--aesthetic, intellectual, emotional, sexual etc. I've always taken
this belief to mean that the emphasis is on political awareness via or in
regards to the practice of writing--the insistence that anybody can write
and thus participate in the larger socio-cultural discourse(s).
         I never really bought Silliman et al, though, because it seemed
to me that they did in fact want that special kind of glory that comes
with being a star--with being an "original" writer--a "brilliant"
intellectual.
        In my view, writers like Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, and Leslie
Scalapio are far more true to the "tenets" of langpo that have to do with
"socialist" approaches to writing--writing as participation in the
sociopolitical, rather than as glorification of the individual through the
lyrical display of sensitivity and accumen.
        Such a charge has been launched at Silliman et al by a lot of
people--but I just wanted to say that I agreed with your point--and that
this was the same point I was trying to make in an effort to admonish
those older writers who believe it their place to "scold" us younger
writers about originality. It seems to me that the fact that young people
are writing (and thus engaging in the body politic as well
as the body aesthetic) should be enough--that these older writers
should just face the fact that their own stated poetics in some sense
preclude them from making aesthetic judgement about young writers...
        Similarly, though, the point you make also serves to critique
Dale's points about langpo, because Dale is demanding that langpo writers
fulfill some sort of socio-aesthetic contract between themselves and their
audience that, according to Barthes,is impossible to fulfill because of
the very solitude of the writer--regardless of what his or her
stated goals about style may be...
        I hope I'm making sense here. I suppose I just think that bad
reviews (of young writers, of langpos) are a waste of time. That what is
fruitful is a discussion of those styles that, perhaps, bridge some kind
of gap enough to make us feel a little bit less "solitary"--both
intellectually and aesthetically... That what is most interesting to hear
about is how someone's style strikes us as more than individual (though
not necessarily "universal")--
        It just seems so "easy" to disagree with styles that seem far
from our own--

Yours,
Katy

while i'm a bit intrigued by the "warring identity" suggested in the last
line, this all seems a bit simplistic and narrow to me / what kind of
"reader instructions," for example, are given by a one-word or one-letter
line -- how would either be "intoned" in accordance with "intonation
contours required by prose rhythm," the latter itself a suspect
qualification / i think there's something to be said for thinking of lines
as "contours" (for ear or eye) but the idea of lines as "transparent
graphic signs for phonological entities" seems widely off the mark / even
contradictory, for how can graphic signs be "transparent" in any sense? /
seems to me that as "perceptual units" (accepting that terminology)
letters, words and lines are continuously *shape-shifting* between
phonological and graphic contours -- seen/heard in a wavy dance that joins
eye and ear / also, the spatial relationship implied by "verse lines with
white space around" seems to go to the hear-it of the matter: why not white
space *overlayed* or *imprinted* with verse lines to suggest the space was
there first as a visual field before the lines were drawn on

this takes the passage perhaps too far out of the "picture poem" focus the
rest is concerned with, but i couldn't get past these early equations

Bravo Marjorie!!
I've never seen so much ado about the syllabus of someone
else's course! I've found it all so pointless. Those that
disagree should teach their own courses, or write their
own articles, or produce their own work. The constant
cavilling, nit-picking commentary is really quite disgusting.

THE KEY (IS THE FLEA)

a formulaic ode in tractor-trailertylic hexametres

for Marquis Louis Fortinblatt-Hohenzollern du Pwints

"Expedient execution of subject matter is key,"*
quoth splendiferous Louis the 16th to the flea -
aloft in voluminous hammock at Versailles,
fleas under his legs, mosquitoes in the sky,
unable to read LIAISONS DANGEREUSES
for all the nipping at his privateuses.
"Bring me a heavier novel!" cried the King,
unable to withstand said cruel sting
a moment longer.  They brought him DON QUIXOTE,
which forthwith he deployed upon his pinky
(the 3rd) - and thus, expediently, my dear Marquis,
saved France from another flea-bitten monarchy.

Guston is great.  I didn't know about these collaborations with Coolidge.

Maine poet John Tagliabue has done some neat poem-painting collaborations
with his wife Grace over the years.  The poems swirl into watercolors.

I'm not sure if Joseph would stand by this paragraph today. He might.

I say:

Poetic form is NOT _a concept_, even though most critics must treat it as
one in order to say much about it, AND since when is it the job of form to
reflect an _understanding_ of the world?

Taken together, concepts and understanding are devices that seek to
hypostasize the world, arrest it, frame it, put it under glass. They're the
critic's tools NOT the artist's.

Better to hear Nietzsche out: "understanding kills"

It's bewildering to me how a poem could _too much bear the stamp of [its]
reality_, as if that meant such work was too real, not dead enough yet, to
be bothered with.

_his condition_?

_contemporary_ reality?

Who's?

Where?

Here comes the world,

turn off the tv.

Dear Spound,

You post kind of jibes with my theory of what langpo is if we may say it is
something, adds up to something, and we are probably better off saying not.
But since I've sort of enjoyed everyone's reductivity lately, I will join
y'all. Langpo is a theory of vizpo.  Langpo fails as material writing.  I've
never read a langpo poem that made me feel the matieriality, free floater,
what not, of the signifier.  Material writing is impossible.  The best you get
in this slant from langpo is a self-referential grunty fen, which is an idea
of the material, a theory for doing vizpo.  But good vizpo is material
something, not exactly writing.  but what you said Scott.

Well done Bill. As one who has traded many quips and folded many bits of
paper and fused hips in front of computer monitors and trucked over to
Joel's house to do more of the same--with Joel and Bill and others I _can_
relate to _materiality_ and all the staring and listening it takes to
really _see_ and _hear_ and _make_ poetry not merely visual but real.
Something.

But the meism of this debate gets tiring after a while. No one has really
come out and said why vizpo matters, if it does. For meikal and bob the
answer is implicit in their years and years of work. It's hardly for them
to say. As Pound used to say to a young McLuhan: "all the answers to your
questions are in the first 80 Cantos." Others genuinely wonder, as Joel
says, what the fuss is about.

I read much of the growling and pissing, the territoriality that has come
to the fore, as a symptom of something worth pursuing in a less ad homenim
way because there is a real difference at stake between langpo and the
concertistes which explains meikal, bob and company's irritation at the two
being conflated in Marjorie Perloff's syllabus.

Aside from the absurd implication that a langpod can't be a vizpot (_Veil_
is as worthy a part of the vizpot corpus as anything), there is the
question of what separates the two modes of writing. And I would use this
rift to raise exactly that question. The term materiality (or some
derivative thereof) has been used to describe the work of both the langpods
and the vizpots.

In some usages, notably that of Dale Smith's rabid attacks, materiality
seems to connote decadance, a kind of super-literariness that entails a
high quotient of reflexivity and dialectical highjinx (pace Silliman,
Watten, Bernstein). This I would situate as a kind of dialectical
materialism in which the material of the poem is the result of putting an
obscenely wide lens in front of the poet's gaze on things. This practice
explodes (for one) the notion that the work of the poet is one of selection
and subtle taste in the fine matters of living. I would cite Ron Silliman's
work of the _Ketjak_ _Tjanting_ period where anything can and does pass
through the poem (shitting, waiting for the bus, eating, fucking, etc.).
There is the poem's indiscriminate preoccupation with matter as a site of
poetic possibility and there is an ironic residue of decadence to that, a
Duchampian decadence. I qualify this as dialectical because, in addition to
this preoccupation with materiality, there is the supplemental dimension of
what is at stake in putting that kind of raw, unformed material IN A POEM.
There is paradoxically an extremely high degree of consciousness in that
kind of work, the same high degree of consciousness that informs Duchamps
ready-mades; as brute and bold gestures, they are nonetheless extremely
sophisticated.

There are those that believe Duchamp challenged the sanctity of art with
his ready-mades. I believe he did the opposite, he reinforced it, for the
same reason that the langpods extending the limits of the poem reinforces
that sanctity of the poem as a capacious entity (kinda like Walt Whitman).
So you can call that materiality of you want; I regard it as an infusion of
matter into the ever-virtual sphere of the poem. Nothing wrong with that in
the least, as long as we remember that it is a nominal materiality that is
at work there.

Materiality in poetry SHOULD mean works that brush up against the limits
not of _the poem_ but of the real. That is what the best concrete vizpot
does. It does not thematize matter; it challenges the audience to view
letters and words as real things with a domension and duration all their
own, not merely as indices in an overdetermined virtual world of meaning.

There is great beauty and courage in work that is willing to forsake the
readymade structure of phonetic literacy and put letters in the service of
creating spaces and temporalities that outstrip anything the alphabet was
designed to contain and control.

I salute meikal and bob and all the other concretists on this list for
their work. I got my eye on you.

It's late (for me) my salt bath is ready. Grind on.

On Jan 27, Maria Damon wrote, helpfully, on the "visual poetry"
discussion (excerpt):

Gary Robert's post picked up nicely, too, on this issue of
cross-genre porousness.

I thought I'd re-post here Clemente Padin's eulogy for Edgardo
Antonio Vigo (originally forwarded by Robert Drake early last
December). Padin, from Uruguay, is one of the leading figures
in the "visual poetry" movement on a world scale, and the Vigo
tribute confirms, I think, that Maria and Gary are right about the
"porousness" of the "visual" designation. Padin's piece _also_
confirms quite eloquently, if confirming is needed, that the field of
current work that tends to be discussed on this list is only a small
and local corner of "forward-looking" poetic practice and
possibility-- indeed, compared to the decidedly genreless spaces
which poets (that most porous of words) like Vigo inhabit, our corner
may well strike future observers as relatively institutionalized and
staid.

It's a good thing, and who could argue otherwise, that someone like
Marjorie Perloff has used her seminar as a tentative window onto
a too-little known dimension and tradition of language practice; it
is also a good thing, as I see it, that Bob Grumman has stuck his
neck out to say (twenty times or so) that Marjorie's syllabus is only
a snippet from a very rich and underappreciated international current
of poetic-semiotic labor-- a current whose constant inventiveness
in the face of obscurity and scorn is evoked (somewhat movingly, at
least to me) in Padin's post below.

Bob has said that a number of the poets on Marjorie's syllabus have a
relatively peripheral relationship to this visual-conceptual
tradition and I don't see how anyone could argue with that. Marjorie
herself, I think, would agree. If Bob now can say that his protracted
point-making has been, at bottom, a tactical and comradely
intervention (one which has done, Bob, a worthy job), probably those
who wish to can now pull up chairs to a more theoretical discussion
of the "visual"? A few posts have already moved in that direction. I,
for one, am eager to learn more.

Here is Padin's memorial to Edgardo Antonio Vigo:

Please, pass on this text:
EDGARDO ANTONIO VIGO: Aspiration to Freedom

Clemente
Padin

Edgardo Antonio Vigo, aged 70, died in La Plata, the city of his birth.
Vigo was an engraver, experimental poet, conceptualist, constructor of
"objects-without-use" and "oddmachines," a constant innovator whose only
recently discovered work keeps on surprising, given the almost ineffable
character of his projects. He also cultivated forms that until now have
been considered sub-artistic or simply not thought of as "art" in the
vernacular sense of the term, such as mail art and experimental poetry.

In Vigo's work can be seen influences of Marcel Duchamp-we recall Vigo's
film Blanco sobre Blanco (White on White), shown on the spectators' backs,
and the "ready-mades" he constantly sent his friends-and, above all, of
Macedonio Fernandez, not only in his irreverent attitude but also in his
long and contradictory titles and paratexts. From both, Vigo took the ludic
attitude of play, making the spectators participate and desacralizing the
work of art through manipulation and co-creation, to the point that he
preferred to speak of the "creative-constructor" instead of the "spectator,"
trying to make of artistic creation a multiple act, not something individual
and solitary.

Born in La Plata in 1927, Vigo enrolled in the School of Fine Arts of the
La Plata University in 1950 and, in 1953, he went on a scholarship to
France where he met the Venezuelan artist Jesus Soto and came into contact
with the international avant-garde. In 1954, on returning to his country,
Vigo exhibited wooden objects that already foretold his later tendency
towards an art of popular participation. He was an important magazine
editor, publishing Diagonal Cero (1961) and Hexagono 70, which featured
"novisima" poetry-what he liked to call visual poetry-together with the
subsequent Nuestro Libro Internacional de Estampillas y Matasellos (Our
International Book of Stamps and Postmarks) with original stamps and
postmarks by artists from around the world (artistamps and rubber stamps).
These are considered paradigmatic of what is known today as "artists'
books." In 1965 Vigo exhibited his first "useless machines," such as the
Palanganometro Mecedor para Criticos de Arte (Palaganometer
Rocking Chair for Art Critics) and the Bi-Tri-Cicleta Ingenua
(Ingenuous Bi-Tri-Cycle) that was heaped with vernacular criticism,
initiating a long silence that lasted until the 1990s. But, the alternative
scene in France, 1967, published his Poemas Matematicos Barrocos
(Mathematical Baroque Poems) and the next year his Poemas Matematicos
Incomestibles (Mathematical Inedible Poems) (an object enclosedbetween two
empty tuna cans soldered together). Also, in 1968, in La Plata there
appeared his first traffic light, Manojo de Semaforos (Bunch of Traffic
Lights). This consisted of analyzing from the aesthetic and creative point
of view the traffic signals located in the intersection of First and
Sixtieth Avenues in La Plata. Presenting an anonymous and useless element in
its specific function (stressing an ironic urban commentary) this project
sought to initiate a specific dialogue with an abstract content. The public
invited to participate were to develop their ideas using the minimal keys
given by the artist, who wasn't there. The proposal was to subtract out all
prejudicial contact in order to generate an action in freedom.

In issue 11 of the magazine Los Huevos del Plata (1968) there appeared
Vigo's New Avant-Garde Poetry in Argentina and experimental poems by Jorge
de Luxan, Carlos Ginzburg, Luis Pazos, and his own. Here is found
the second break with the lyric tradition in Argentina (the first was in the
1930s, under the sign of Ultraism).

From the mid-60s, Vigo was a proponent of conceptualist tendencies in Latin
America, above all the Conceptualism applied to undoing the mechanisms and
instrumentation of the work of art and its relation to its spectators, not
the Conceptualism of Kosuth's "Art is the definition of art." Vigo
emphasized the
self-referential qualities of the work that not only promoted ambiguity (the
possibility of extreme polysemy) but also the possibility of the choice of
the spectator in the final selection of meaning, causing him to be
considered as co-author of the work itself. Vigo's project in this sense was
crystallized in Poetry to and/or Realize, through which he tried to get the
spectator to participate in the "constructive activation with which it is
possible for the consumer to pass over to the category of creator"  (From
Process Poetry to Poetry to and/or Realize, Diagonal Zero, La Plata, 1970).
Vigo continued with the I Expo de Proposiciones a Realizar (I Expo of
Propositions to Realize) in 1971, which took place in the Cayc, Centro de
Arte y Comunicacion (Art and Communication Center) of Buenos Aires, where,
together with works received from all around the world, were brought
together the artists Wlademir Dias-Pino (creator of Brazilian Process/Poem),
Guillermo Deisler (the late Chilean visual poet), and the Uruguayans
Francisco Accame (musician and sound poet), and myself.

On one of his first visits to our country, Vigo realized-during the
"Exhibition of Avant-Garde Publications" organized by the magazine OVUM 10
in the Hall of the University of the Republic on September 30, 1970, the
proposal "Demagogic Poem," a parody of the election process. Votes were cast
in an urn with a round opening. The ballots were nothing but forms
distributed by the performer in which the participant-creator was asked to
express whatever he wanted, and then Vigo put the ballots, not folded but
rolled up in the form of cylinders, into the special container.

At the beginning of the 1970s, Vigo joined the new currents of mail art,
becoming one of its most regular creators until the day of his death. The
military dictatorship of his country struck hard, causing one of his sons
to disappear. Because of this disgraceful act, Vigo's work took on a
strongly political character such that his contacts with foreigners were
augmented, spreading the word about the brutal repression and crimes
against humanity of this ferocious dictatorship. From this period came his
work Trelew (1974), in memory of the 16 revolutionaries assassinated in the
Trelew jail in southern Argentina on August 22, 1972. On each page of the
book is a representation of each fallen body. From those sad moments Vigo
lent his talent to the mobilizations of the "Mothers of the Plaza of May"
(his collective visual poem "Sembrar la memoria" [To Seed Memory] was
emblematic, realized in the large popular event "Everyone or No One" that
the group "Ezcombros" organized in La Plata on December 9, 1995). In his
last years, Vigo's work turned towards the light; he exhibited individually
in the Tan Telmo Foundation (1991), where  he had a retrospective show of
his major works. In 1994, he was selected to form the Argentine section to
the XXII Biennial of Sao Paulo, Brazil, thereby achieving world recognition
in this area.

To conclude, allow me to include these words of Vigo's taken from his
public declaration of 1968,"An Art to Realize," that will give us a more
accurate idea of his project:

"Towards a touchable art that breaks in the artist the possibility of the
use of "rotten" materials to the extreme that they produce the alienation
of the hand of the observer -simple form of perception- that will stay in
this position without the "epidermal" participation of the thing. Through
use of "base" materials and for a delimiting quotidian context of the
content. A touchable art that rejects the possibility of satisfying an
"elite" that the artist has been forming to his regret, a touchable art that
can be located in any home and not enclosed in Museums and Galleries.
An art with mistakes that alienates the exquisite. Taking advantage to the
maximum of the aesthetic of "surprise," through "occurrence" -primary act of
creation- to be converted -already in for the masses form- into involving
movements or for individuality congruence of intentionality-, in attitude.
An art of expansion, of atrape for the ludic way, that facilitates active
participation of the spectator, the absurd way. An art of signaling so that
the quotidian escapes  to the unique possibility of the functional. No more
contemplation without action. No more exhibition without presentation.
Where inert material, stable and fixed, takes its movement and necessary
change so that the image is constantly modified. Finally: a contradictory art."

Only with some difficulty have I been able to touch on all or even some of
the facets and dimensions of this indefatigable creator, barely able
schematically to redeem Vigo's attitude towards art and the society in
which he lived and suffered. This artist subjected himself only to his own
rules. All his life he was guided by ideas having to do with freedom. His
work will last as long as there exists in people this desire for liberty
that he tried to keep fresh by confronting the split of choosing between
the various possibilities of signification (including that of altering
meaning) that his works offered, thereby concretizing through that choice
our deepest nature: the aspiration to freedom.

My dear Henry, let it not be said that you ever passed up a chance to
grab the moral high ground. Imagine my relief on learning that I don't
have to be a dog! "Attention New York: cancel those dozen long-stems to
Alice Quinn!"  Cronyism is what's deplorable when others are able to use
it to their advantage but great when it works to one's own.

I don't know where the kind of independence you envision exists - I'm
not even sure what it's an independence from: but this idea of freedom
from the influence of those Bad and Corrupt Publishers and Evil
Successful Writers I'll hazard to guess has more to do with an anxiety
about "contamination" than anything else. As if we all of us wrote in
carefully sealed hermetic containers - "Oh MY Soul, Oh MY Inspiration -
back off Jack!" Personally I welcome the enthusiams, the tastes, the
excesses of writers I know: they challenge me to grow and, I hope,
flourish, though that remains to be seen.

The fact of the matter is is that poetry exists and must thrive in the
context of those heartless things, i.e. publishers, magazine editors,
printers, critics, other writers, even the mail carrier gets a piece of
the action, and the attempt to moralize about this situation merely has
the effect of warping and decontextualizing any serious discussion about
it. Exactly who are you attacking here - or is everyone on the List to
be tarred with the same swift brush? It's well and good to rail against
those with no integrity but if you go on in that vein you run the risk
of demonizing a lot of  people who are simply up against it like you and
me and everyone else, trying to make tough decisions and worried to
death about screwing up their jobs, their lives, etc.

I see the buddy system & po-biz as a positive danger to independence,
standards, and taste.

It is possible to write poetry, send it to journals & publishers,
write essays, and find friends, allies and supporters, without
sucking up, bullshitting, and betraying your principles.  You may
become a highly-acclaimed false prophet & bad poet eventually -
or you may languish in honest obscurity.  But you don't have to
be a dog.

Mr M

It is revealing that you term a much needed discussion of visual poetrys
relation to poetics, academics, economics, distribution & media
"disgusting"....if you read the well over a 100 posts carefully (think
Ive read each in detail), very little of the posts concern themselves
with the infamous Perloff syllabus, tho many use it as a relevant &
pointed metaphor for the politics of the literary machine.... No one has
condemned MPs work as a teacher or writer & if Im recollecting correctly
most of us have spoken how highly we regard her work.  This discussion
has been conducted with respect to all parties involved....I feel like
there has truly been a spirit of looking under the rug, saying what isnt
being said, & overall I find these posts most provocative & have been
desemimating compliations of various post on visual poetry to a number
of other lists in order that the discussion goes cross channel, outside
this cozy little enclave.

Aldon,

I categorically denounce all syllabi. In fact, I categorically denounce =
all plurals in English that are declined as if still Latin. Once a word =
becomes English, it should behave accordingly. Ergo, I supplant syllabi =
with syllabuses; fungi with funguses, ominbi with omnibuses, pie with =
pusses and spaghetti with spaghettuses. This is not specific to your =
course of course but please accept what crumbs of indignance I am able to =
offer at this point.

from e-correspondence with Ted Warnell, quoted with permission:

"Input via hyperlinks... process of readers actions/reactions/
interaction with the presentation... creativity after the fact,
or, re-creation of the meaning/the work in the reader's mind --
subjective. If so, this is an important comcept, central to all
art, I think. The Web offers new means to realize this idea,
means of objective as well as subjective realization.


"The Poem by Nari work there is an actualization/realization of the
meaning of Mark's paper, 'Surf-Sample-Manipulate...'. The PbN work
is constructed from both the content and code that is virtually/
conceptually/literally his paper. That's probably obvious.
.... Given my understanding of the
ideas expressed so eloguently by Mark Amerika, this work and future
works attempt to move beyond the mechanics of surf-sample... to explore
the meaning of surf-sample... and to create new meaning partly from
the process (mine and the viewers - subjective), and also from the
structure/restructuring of the source material (fixed plus dynamic
at run time, subject to Web browser variables, etc., beyond my
knowing - objective) . Use of quotes (you mentioned) in these works
exist as 'cues' to the reader, providing (I hope) a subtle direction
for interpretation without imposing meaning... links to source material
(sometimes, not always) provide additional opportunity for viewer
participation, much as your goals, I think.

"Subjective/objective is of current great interest...

"About a current fascination with new and glitz... I agree with your
evaluation of 'art on the Web' at this time, and I see this as a
natural and necessary stage in the development of the Web as creative
medium/media. We all go through it at the start -- a need to explore
and experiment with the medium to see what it can do, what we can do
with it. This is how I view much of the 'art' currently on the Web,
(including much of the work of Poem by Nari), more a technical exercise
than an aesthetic expression. Eventually, of course, we get past all
of this, and then begin to work *in* the medium (or the media that
is the Web). I am seeing more of this now -- aesthetics beyond the
technical. I see it in your work -- Winter is decidedly not glitzy.
The use of hand drawn material brings a very personal/human touch
to this work (takes the viewer beyond a purely digital reference) --
my perception -- is this your intention?

"I had always assumed in some vague way that outlines were 'real'...
looking at objects around me.  When really looked at in relation to
each other their outlines were not clear and compact, as I had
always supposed them to be, they continually became lost in shadow...
how was it possible to have remained unaware of this fact for so
long?  Second, why was such a great mental effort necessary in
order to see the edges of objects as they actually show
themselves...

     "I noticed that the effort neede in order to see the edges
of objects as they really look stirred a dim fear, a fear of
what might happen if one let go one's mental hold on the outline
which kept everything in its place; and it ws similiar to that
fear of a wide focus of attention

     "the outline represented the world of fact, of separable

to protect oneself against the other world, the world of
imagination.

Can't remember if it's Allen or Alan?

Interestingly, Euphorbus, litmag out of Princeton, got the Allen right,
but spelled his last name "Ginsburg." And to make matters worse, the
poem refers to Marilyn Monroe's "butocks." Maybe academia isn't really
all we're cracking it up to be.

bill,

     You could ask Dr. Tsur - this material is on the web.

     My take, though, is that yes, it is somewhat simplified - he is a
psychologist and we do tend at times to simplify things literary,  and
I think he probably is not aware of vizpo and most likely other modern
focuses on visual space in poetry.  "Reader instructions" is a bit of
jargon which might be better put as "reader suggestions" - an idea I've
been playing with in some degree in my so-far-basic attempts to give
the reader some choice in hyperlinks to follow as opposed to following
the authors trails.

     Your questions about "transparency" of graphic signs and the shape-
shifting of phonetic/graphemic units are, I think, important ones that
I don't think Dr. Tsur has resolved - they may not be resolvable in any
simple manner and worth a pause in reading.  These are issues I have
been playing around with in my own way through collage, distortion of
shapes, and clarity of words and ideas vs. obscurity, indecipherability
of same on various backgrounds and the way the larger .gifs swallow or
wipe out meaning or distort the apparent 'reality' of what is/was said
verbally by the language, words, sounds, etc.  I certainly don't have
answers to any of these questions, but you can see some of my 'play'
with these things on my sites. Will send URLs if you don't have them.


    You do raise some interesting issues - thanks for the interest.

I hope you don't mind me stepping in here, Katy, but I have so many
questions. First: enough for what? That young people are so engaged is
wonderful, necessary, admirable, deserving of support and celebration, yes,
but...enough for what?

In what sense? I don't follow you. We're all students. With all respect,
that includes Pearlman and Perloff and Bernstein and Bowering. That's good.

What's more, I'm 40. That's neither particularly old nor particularly
young. Does that mean I can make no aesthetic 'judgements', on those poets
older or younger than myself? Does it follow as well that young writers can
make no aesthetic 'judgements' on my work or on that of my elders? What use
would such a stratification serve?

Why would they be more or less a waste of time than bad reviews of any
other writers or schools of poetry?

Splendid!

Ah, so you're remarking that bad reviews in general are fruitless, that
you'd rather see energy go towards making bridges than towards carving
ravines? Great!

Yes, too easy.

Mr Grumman's attack on Perloff reminds me of all those socialist parties
that were always attacking one another for not being the right kind of
socialists. Why not go after the cement-heads who wont bother to read any
interesting poetry at all? I would certainly advise any students I might
have to enrol in Perloff's course instead of some course about dullard
poets. The figures on her list sound (*and look!) pretty interesting to me.
What's the complaint? I never get up the nerve to teach Zukofsky (well, not
much) but I am sure glad someone does. Quartermain does. I am not going to
jump on him for teaching Zuk instead of Reznikoff.

this discussion of vizzzzipoe has made me want to articulate (even in
this brief kind of way) some of my thoughts on not only what constitutes
vizzzi work but more over what i see as a more basic asthetic drive
behind vizz. one of the roots of langpo production was (/is?) a desire to
make visible the materiality of language and thereby be able to address
linguistic economy and economies of meaning through a programmed
disfunction of standard (or maybe more normative) meaning and sense
making. through transforming the way in which we see meaning per se we
are able to percieve qualities of language otherwise made invisible or
transparent by our trained linguistic prejudice to see textual language
as immediate communication. these newly visible qualities of language are
in many cases what make language poetic (rhythm sound oddness shape
etc)but by no means do the language poets have a monopoly on revealing
languages otherness. fiction writers like federman bs johnson and steve
katz were engaged in this project in the 60s. and one could make a case
for dada zaum and the like to have been doing this before wwii. here
though i would like to switch tact a bit and instead of talking about the
materiality of language i would like to talk about the physicality of
language which may seem like a bit of a slim distinction but bear with me
on this. sound and visual poetry is concerned with the physicality of
language and communication. the physicallity of the act the physicality
of the fact the physicality of text (whatever that might be). so a
poetics of sound and vision is poetics of physicality rather than one of
materiality. the destinction is that in the case of language poetry there
is a concerted effort to examine ecconomies of meaning making and in
visual and sound biz it is the object of the work itself which is under
investigation rather than an investigation of the means of production.
the physicality of a sound text by cris cheek both on the page and in
the flesh is an examination of the nature of both communication outside
of normative linguistic structures and what it means to produce one
type of expression from another (sound from vision). steve mccafferys
carnival works not so much because it is a huge piece of paper covered
in courier but because it isn't a huge piece of paper covered in
courier. bps cartoons and alphabetic fixations work because they
incorperate a plethora of visual and linguistic elements into a plexus of
meaning making outside of normative linguistic patterns (ie words). john
currys little bits and things work the same way. and i could go on. so
when i was down on druckers visible word as being too concerned with
typography i was objecting not to examination of typography in general
but to her seeing type as a means of articulating the visual at the
expense of other meaning making stratagies in visual work. it seems
important in looking at visual and sound texts to see them as a whole
from the object of the book/the physical performance down through to the
grain of the paper the type of ink the face of any type the shoes being
worn the arangement of hands the syncopation of breathing the jumble of
language etc. one of the reasons that this debate is so longwinded is
that language poetry (certainly as evidenced by the early new york [nuf
said] and baltimore folks [ie kirby malone chris mason and the rest of
the coacident/epod clan]) works within the boundries of visual and sound
poetry (and sometimes i am tempted to see language poetry as a subset of
visual and sound poetry) although by no means does it cover the spectrum
of visual and sound work. So marjories silly bus looks more like a
language poetry anthology than a visual poetry one even though all of the
work she is looking at contain strong visual experimentation. what she
misses though is the rest of visual poetry miekals ball of popcorn.

Can't remember if it's Allen or Alan?

Interestingly, Euphorbus, litmag out of Princeton, got the Allen right,
but spelled his last name "Ginsburg." And to make matters worse, the
poem refers to Marilyn Monroe's "butocks." Maybe academia isn't really

I would like to second what I think I hear Bill Howe saying about the
distinction between the material and the physical aspects of production,
without claiming that one sort of poetry is a subset of the other. I
would offer in a similar vein that some work that is highly visual is
also in a way diagrammatic, not unlike avant-garde styles of musical
scoring, and may take the notion of scored speech as an act of mapping.
The interest in all this I suppose would be a of relatively
formal/conceptual order, sifting, sorting, gridding, making few claims
as to the content itself, but discovering meaning and use value. The
foregoing is the vein that I would associate with the langpo--vispo
nexus.

Vispo qua vispo (setting the diagrammatic to oneside for the moment) has
gone through its own performative history--one in which the act of
registering the mark on the page becomes one of the many performance
aspects. It tends in the modern form to forefront collage, bricolage,
--with an eye to some holographic sense of the fulleness or texture of
the piece. It is resolutely non additive. Non syntactic I might say--as
the visual arts in general seem non-syntactic unless you are as a reader
determined to narrativize all visual productions. I think of how a text
(like the Bible)can be sacred to an "illiterate" shaman pristess (Maria
Sabina), of how hieroglyphs or runes have an untranslateable wholeness
that is lost when phoneticized, linearized. I think this notion of
wholeness as an experiential fact of physical performance, be
performance a registration of marks in the sand or on the page or a
shouting of gutterals on a ridge top is probably in fact just too spooky
and unreal for a sensible material poetics like langpo and that is why
there is so much at stake in this devbate for some writers/artists. I
will go so far as to suggest that main drive for much vispo qua vispo
has been a desire to experience in performance a touch of the
sacred--that the ephemeral fact of performance is crucial to the
multimedia zeitgest and that the tendency has been to move away form
temple building eternalizations of the sacred to a performative whole of
feeling it on the fly of seeing it in samisdat and other instrumental
forms always wanting somehow to produce more in different ways whether
the quality oif the surface is degraded or slick--the situating of the
artit's physical being in a way that allows production becomes crucial.

So how does the split boil out then: oneside emphasizes physical
production of material objects even as thos objects themselves become
more ephemeral, for this kind of vispo production is meaning; for langpo
though the emphasis is on the materiality of meaning production and in
its visual form lango po will seem more a mapping of surfaces than a
making, using, enacting of them--and will even seem to violate the
little bit of sacredness that can still be attached to production and
that is why there is so much at stake in this debate for some of the
respondents.

Don't relieve yourself too soon, Patrick.  You're barking up the wrong

Actually, I've never been aware of any influence of Publishers on my
work in any way shape or form.  Writers, yes - as writers, not as
pimps.  I'm worth more than you can ever afford, & besides, I'm
independent!

Academics fawn over their pets.  Publishers suck up to academics (they
order their books for courses).  Your contemporaries want to have a
good time being "writers". Do you want to write for any of these
people?  I write for love, love, love. Love is strong as death;
jealousy as cruel as the grave.

katy l writes, among other things:
In my view, writers like Lyn Hejinian, Carla Harryman, and Leslie
Scalapio are far more true to the "tenets" of langpo that have to do with
"socialist" approaches to writing--writing as participation in the
sociopolitical, rather than as glorification of the individual through the
lyrical display of sensitivity and accumen.

****
this brings up an interesting point i've been wanting to ask POETIX about
for some time.  while katy doesn't make it explicit, gender is an obvious
subtext here.  my experience is that, though i was first attracted to
"language poetry" or whatever my understanding of it was some years ago by
reading women --hejinian, scalapino, waldrop, mayer, berssenbrugge, etc,
and i started teaching them. i'd barely heard of bernstein,  silliman i
knew by name only (and because i knew he was involved w/ the socialist
review), and watten's theoretical polemics in the anthologies i found
somewhat turgid, perelman i knew not at all except that he was mentioned by
jameson.  however, when i started going to conferences on the poetry
circuit (as opposed to the cult studs circuit) i met...bernstein, perelman,
watten, etc. i found them quite delightful, not at all the disembodied
hyperintellectuals i'd imagined.  but scalapino, hejinian, etc, were
nowhere to be seen. i still haven't met them.  i have met rachel blau dp
and joan retallack at conferences, and i did see susan howe years ago
speaking about emily dickinson, and was blown away, but believe it or not i
had no idea she was a poet at the time (mid -80s).  i imagine this has
something to do with who teaches and thus has a travel stipend, etc.  and i
imagine that this, in turn, has to do with traditional divisions of labor
as much as with taste (some people may not WANT to teach at a u, i'm aware,
like ron s). while the u  of mn has by now brought out kathleen fraser,
mei-mei b and myung-mi kim (the latter two while i was away on sabbatical,
typically enough; and the former without any knowledge that she
participated in a certain style of writing).  i know this is to some extent
because i went to stanford when it was just crawling out from under its
yvor winters legacy (marjorie and i overlapped for only a year i believe),
and minnesota isn't exactly a mecca for writing communities, and the
university, already pretty impecunious, is pretty much the most
conservative cultural institution in the state, and that 's saying a lot;
plus very hierarchical, so that it wasn't until after i'd been there 7
years that i even had the clout to suggest we bring anyone out...so
anyway...anyway, what i'm saying is, while i'm aware that there are other
factors in my not having met the people who first piqued my interest in
experimental writing, it seems significant that, even having been on the
academic po-conf circuit for a few years now my initial inspirants haven't
been represented as thoroughly as their male counterparts.  any ideas?.

Am I alone in thinking that the term "materiality" is often used in too
reductive a sense?  Koestler once made the telling point that in a cosmos
where sub atomic particles go forward and backward in time, where light is
both a particle & wave, that "material" is something almost imaginary.

The distinction between physicality & materiality -- quite apart from the
context of visual poetics, or how the body/language divide was played by the
New Americans & the Language poets -- seems very suggestive to me.  An essay
of John Yau's has been kicking around in my head for a couple of days in
which he speaks of a type of artistic *scale* for which "the determing factor
was the human body, not as something that could embrace an immense vista or
chart a seemingly unlimited expanse, but as something contingent, doubtful,
and questioning . . . Is it possible," he asks, "to privlege neither body
(seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling) nor mind (remembering,
conceiving, and dreaming) and still make art?"  This seems relevant to poetry
as well, & suggestive somehow of a kind of constantly shifting perception of
the physical & material without the binarism that frequently occurs in LangPo
& the New American poetry.

Howdy Y'all.  It was a late night on the Texas poetry list.  Me and Henny
Cowtow got into a showdown over the contractual aggrements between writers of
the famous 'horseshoe'genre of Tx poetry vs. the Flat Bed Ford theory of visual
 presentation.  But somewhere around 3 in the morning, Buffalo Pouty sent me
  an article he copied from the eeCOnomist.  One excerpt reads:

"Contemporary poetry is often obscure or self-referential, neither scans nor
rhymes nor tells a story, is  impossible to memorise, is often about the act
of writing poetry itself, is humourless, and can be more like a puzzle than a
poem...  Irontically, as poetry has become less significant as a cultural form,
 more of it has been produced."

I told Buffalo he was loco as a cooked goose.  Folks down here just don't get
high ideals or give a sympathetic god damn about formal gestures.  You gotta
practically pry Larry McMurtry off their face.  But the ideas expressed on this
Texas poetry list will surely bring'em round.  Hell.  The Economist is
practically a Communist publication!  What do they know?

my experience to Maria's is extremely similar, except that I discovered Susan Howe first
and then came to these other women writers. Because of this, and certain takes on the
"sociopolitical" (K. Lederer) and linguistics, I have always felt that 70s movement
towards (not of) "langwedge" poets was one whose most "genuine" players were women,
meaning that they were the "best" poets of that "scene." Therefore, I have never
understood the arguments that langouedge poetry was some kind of guy thing. Certainly
that raises many structural and social issues which are sadly at play in the society at
large. But I also felt that this arguement tended to elide the serious artists whose work
had become crucial to me, and that it demeaned those women who felt otherwise from this
perspective. I've found this to be true in grad school as well. But this isn't Maria's
point and is kind of an aside.

And I came to language poetry standing in Powell's books in pdx and found that they
stocked all the new poetry. Browsing I learned a lot. I found Susan H's work because it
to me seemed to offer a possibility of "speech" in the post-speech era. Oppen first gave
me tools to recognize again "the world" (out there as opposd to solipsistic interiority)
and from Susan I was gathered by wings. Of course I said that this led me to others
after, and that moment of transition from being an Oppen-head to being a Susan Howe-head
was a very difficult and personally frightening moment of excited transition
to....speech? I think of "Speeches at the barriers" by S.H. or her phrase "fragmentary
narrative enclaves" or the first lines of Elizabeth Robinson's poem "Flower":

All that I can say is that I feel

something    I am a warrior

It is speech    And all the parts of me

are hunting     All the particles

are eating at air

The parts of words eat at bits of

sweets because they cannot be the bearers

of anything else

This was something I had to say and

it was better than pursuit


That Katy mentions that these writers are demonstrating the socialist tenets of language
writing is interesting. I'd like to hear more about this as I think it offers a
facinating possibility for discussion. What is the value of those political claims today?
What are the political-venues for these discussions about poetry?

It would be interesting to make a list of that group of writers. How many of them
received PhDs? How many rec'd PhDs and then went on to pursue academic positions? How
many did pursue academia but with only an MA or MFA? or less...I wonder also if isn't
(hopefully) changing with respect to the current (?) generation.?? yeah, any ideas?

  Hello Jacques---Yau's terms may be useful, the SPIRIT of Yau's terms
  are definitely worth exploring in poetry. I (and I think many other
   poets on this list) attended the opening to the show from which Yau's
   essay comes from. It is worth attending (Apex Art C.P. 291, Church St.,
    NYC---until 2/7), not just to get a sense of Yau's curatorial
eclecticism in the art world, but also to consider the possibility of
   the relations between painting and poetry again, or between painters
   and poets--a connection that i personally would like to see more of,
   Anyway, i'm writing on the fly so I bye.......chris

1. It is Conte-- not "Joseph Comte"

 2. If it is nepotistic for scholar/critics to to promote living writers,
as Henry Gould suggests, then the clear alternative would be to promote
dead ones who no longer depend on the academy for fellowships and the
like, though I suppose that the heirs of these dead writers might also
have a financial stake in the promotion of their work. Or should we write
in a way that disguises the fact that we find the work of our
contemporaries vitally interesting to us, in order to avoid this
promotion?

3.  If anyone knows of any studies of the dialectic between redundancy and
concision in theories of poetic form and meaning please back-channel.

By the way, I think that the Yasusada Poems are  well received, not because
of the potential 'scandal' but because the poems     have a specific context
and reveal a complex emotional range.  The narrative elements are also
compelling, framing the poems.  The subject matter is rich, the formal
expression mysterious and tender.  These poems attempt to reveal suffering, a
rarity in many poems these days.  I can't wait to see the movie.  I guess
the book will have to do for now.  It's great to see something in print by
a poet who can tell a story.  What happened to the story?

Hello, Maria:

If I'm not mistaken, you went to Stanford in the 80s. At that time, an hour or
so north of you, the women you mention (& more) were, to me anyway, more
visible than their male counterparts: When I lived in San Francisco
(1983-1991), the very first reading I went to was Dodie Bellamy (at SF State),
I also saw Lyn read with Tom Raworth, and Lyn reading with Carla Harryman (from
"The Wide Road"), Carla reading with someone else (can't remember who) and
Leslie Scalapino at an AIDS benefit. Others I saw read were Norma Cole, gordon,
Cole Swenson, Kathy Acker (a couple times), Beverly Dahlen, Colleen Lookingbill
(she was in a reading/discussion group w/me & several others), Bernadette
Mayer. I saw Perelman read with Creeley once, and Rodefer a couple of times,
but never got the chance to see Ron read, nor Barry, nor Alan Davies, nor Bruce
Andrews, nor Bernstein (saw him read in Minneapolis, much later). The Susan
Howe reading, some months--maybe even a year or two--after I left town, was
legendary, mainly for its attendance, apparently more people came to that than
to Alice Notley (who I saw read a month or two before we left town). Lyn was
pretty much the most visible of that general crowd, to my peers, largely
because we were all collecting Tuumba Press books, and My Life won whatever the
award is that S.F. State gives out or administers, so it was looked to as
something "important" beyond what personal use we might make of it. Also,
Scalapino, in good part due to her publishing O Books. We were aware of In the
American Tree, and the New Directions Language Poetries, but didn't bother with
them much because we had most of those texts in chapbooks, magazines, perfect
bounds & even manuscripts (great used bookstores, not to mention network of
poets, in the bay area, as you'll recall), & being kind of snobby (I speak for
myself alone here), wanted the "higher groove factor" items--the First Eds,
bay-bay, if often slightly foxed. In Minneapolis, the readings I went to (or
organized) were Acker/Baraka/Hentoff, Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge/Myung Mi Kim,
Kathleen Fraser, Charles Alexander/Spencer Selby, Charles Bernstein, George
Albon, Cheri Hickman, Diane Glancy, Johanna Drucker, Michael Lally, Nico
Vassilakis, Norma Cole, me, Erik Belgum, Jonathan Brannen, you (at an XCP
post-pub reading), Elizabeth Burns (at same), Samuel Delany, Curt Anderson,
Anselm Hollo--a few more men than women, but not really that many more.

My sense is that you didn't, at the time, venture up to San
Francisco/Berkeley/Oakland much while at Stanford, where all of this activity
was taking place. I remember that you told me you saw first not the actual
cartoon-poets cover I did for SPD, but the thing projected on a screen during a
lecture Watten was giving at some conference. So, your initial introduction to
many poets, poetry & even ephemera (!), seems to have taken place through an
academic filter--via conferences, panels, & so forth. I mean, you tell us in
your post as much, and I mention all of the above to support what you're
saying: the activity of the last 10, 20 years has not been inordinately "male":
in fact, has increasingly shifted from male to female. But that word
"filter"--I use it to foreground the idea I have that the quality of academic
activity is, or has been, generally, that of filter, & so what's read through
it is read through it. Living in San Francisco & experiencing poetry through
readings & less formal gatherings is also a filter, the limit of being in a
particular place at a particular time, though a less opaque filter, especially
since many of the activities now in discussion at conferences etc. took place
there. I mean the writing itself, & the interaction/experience/confluences that
gave rise to the writing. So, in answer to your question, more questions: Do
you find academia to be largely male-driven or -informed? Do you find women to
be resistant to it, or hesitant to participate in its culture? I can't tell
from here. My e-address is Columbia, but as you know, I'm merely an office
worker, & don't participate much with anything/anyone here, save the friendly
people at Butler Library. There are, though, I do notice, many more male
history professors in the department than female. There are many more men
posting to this list than women, & I assume that to mean more male access to
e-mail, & a lot of that seems to be guys working in or attending universities.
(Mostly w/more significant roles than mine ((office grunt)).)

Maria, you are that rare tenured academic whose energies are divided between
the filter of the academy and the thing under the microscope--you've not only
brought out poets to read at UMN, but have collaborated with Miekal And, &
published creative as well as lit crit writings. My sense--and please tell me
I'm wrong if I am--is that this hasn't always been the case, that your move to
find some confluence between both has been tenuous, gradual. So that, a decade
or so ago, while going to Stanford, you didn't participate with the living
activity taking place an hour or so north of you, but now, you seem very much
involved in what's taking place among writers not only in Minneapolis, but
elsewhere as well.

Just received Joel's post--& agree that younger women poets today do seem more
actively involved in the filter than before: I don't have to reiterate the list
of names of younger poets that pop up frequently on this list--but to say that
some are grads of Brown, Buffalo, Bard & even a few "non-B" universities. (My
sense, not having seen it yet, is that the forthcoming Talisman anthology of
under-40 poets will draw much work from "B" university grad gals--& would add
another semi-academic B, Boulder ((Naropa)). Certainly this was the case of the
o.blek New Coast volumes. Talisman also has planned, I think, an anthology of
women poets, probably concentrating on 40s & upwards--though I have no details
on that one, either.) So, your movement toward some interaction between the two
"worlds" seems to happen at a time when there is, in fact, a general movement,
among women, toward establishing connections between them. I wonder if, over
time, we'll see more women represented at conferences, sitting on panels, work
by more women under discussion at same. & because of your position, your
interest & your energy (which, okay, does tend to flag in Jan, Feb & March,
given those often brutal winters!), you would seem a good person to begin to
actively work toward your goal. So, another (not rhetorical) question: What
more, at this point in time, might actively be done to help promote this
(besides waiting for all the old white guys to fade off into Club Emeritus)?

i pet my fawns, i fret over my pawns, my pawns rise up against me,
threatening my petting power, my pets paw me, my Paw mauls me, my Maw pulls
me, and everything is very personal in this  awdipal, audible, edible and
oedipal mawlstrom of petting and pawing. academe is a veritable orgy of
petting and fawning, pawning and cloning, clowning and self-abasement up to

Apologies to Joseph Mayhew.  I don't mean to be flippant about the
Academy's valiant social service in supporting those fascinating deserving
artists of today with fellowships, residencies, honors & awards,
book sales, and so forth.  Really, where would poetry be without you?
How callous of me to forget that you're really doing them not only
a favor but a necessary service by writing about the ones you really
care about, instead of all those rich dead poets with their trust funds.
Where indeed would poets live, breathe & compose without you?  Some
starving garret, no doubt.  Joseph, for all us contemporary poets
out here, good & bad, fascinating & dull, important & lightweight,
let me say: thank you.

operative words:  OBJECT ACTION BODY


Marion Milner (Joanna Field) again:

"My whole relationship with other people as well as objects, works of art,
nature, music, could depend upon what I did with this imaginative body
rather than with my concentrated intellectual mind.  And the main thing
about this capacity seemed that, although obviosly an aspect of the mind,
it did feel like a body, in that its essential quality was this sense of
extension in space.  It always had a more or less spatial shape, even when
to do with music, in contrast with the more intellectual capacities of the
mind concerned with reasoning and argument, which seemed somehow above or
abstracted from existence in space.

     "Although mot fully understanding just what this thing was that
could be so spread out I tried deliberately using it by setting myself
exercises in seeing 'action' in nature....that chair I am
looking at, it seemed to be rearing its back, throwing forward its seat,
straddling its legs, full of aggressive defiance.

Maria & Joel -

Many of the women you mention do not in fact have doctorates and haven't
sought them - Some write critically but not as often as the male writers
in the scene have - It has not constituted a central concern of their work
-
The writers you mentioned do often travel to various collecgs and u's - (I
hear their reports -- but more rarely participate in conferences - ) For
many women the model for the writing life has not been the academic career
as it has for some men - This is also true for many men - You will not run
into Kit Robinson, Steve Benson, Alan Davies, Peter Seaton etc at many
conferences though all have been to a few - except maybe Peter - I think
the main difference here is the tenor (or existence at all) of the
critical writing and the degree to which that gains a writer a reputation
that allows "her" to be hired at a u or to want to be - Davies for example
often writes critically but possibly not in an academically legible style
-

One of the resaons I started non was to encourage that kind of engagement
from writers whose criticsm is not always noticed - Leslie for example has
published a book of it - She teaches at two colleges, travels constantly -
but not usually to academic conferences -

I think there is an interesting difference here and one that is not only
along gender lines -

Harold: As per this point: Yes. You're right. This is a vague statement. I
suppose that it's a reaction against the snippet of a discussion I caught
(I believe it was Ron Silliman who said it...) wherein (I believe Ron
Silliman, or someone of that stature) replied to Steve Evans' annoyance at
his criticisms of younger writers by saying that he was "prodding us." I
guess that the cattle herding sense I got from the statement made me feel
condescended to--that the fact that young writers are writing at all
should be "enough" when it comes to the "expectation" that more
established (not just older) writers might feel it is their place to
have of us. I realize that the history of literary discourses is replete
with examples of fruitful prodding of younger (less established) writers
by older writers--but as a woman, and also as a person shaped in many ways
by a more democratically structured academy, as well as a far more
heterogenous one,I feel that perhaps it is fair to question this mode of or means toward
literary "production."
        If Silliman et al feel that young writers are mimicking the
langpos and/or others, then perhaps they should think about the incredibly
powerful role their own padagogy (I think this is an obvious point) is
playing in this mimickry. Perhaps the best way to cultivate "new" or
"original" voices is to leave young writers alone with their generally
limitless funds of inspiration and writerly drive. The fact they they are
writing at all will probably lead at least some of them into something
"interesting"... I don't think that prodding is what is required...

>
Yes. I'm not saying that aesthetic judgements aren't unavoidable and
moreover kind of fun, really. I also agree that the stratification of
writing communities shouldn't be made according to age--or perhaps any
other category. I agree completely. I'm simply responding, again, to
Silliman et al's attitudes toward "younger" writers--an attitude rooted in
these very types of (agist, sexist, intellectualist) stratifications.
        As for the judgment thing--it just seems--inappriate?--to me that
Silliman et al (Tuma etc) would deign to make judgements about "my
generation." From my perspective, most of the more established writers in
any kind of community see only a small fraction of what's produced by the
younger writers. Many of the best young or emerging writers I know don't
yet publish--or don't care to. Some are incrdibly shy--or
unassuming--whatever--and aren't necessarily "in the faces" of more
established writers. People like Spahr and Jarnot and Moxley have been
born and bred in front of the noses of such figures as Bernstein,
Silliman, Waldrop(s) etc. These writers are all terrific--but maybe some
of the more established writers who are complaining on this list should
look a little farther afield than their own MFA Programs--

They're not more or less a waste of time than bad reviews of any other
writers or schools of poetry.

Thanks for the provocative questions--

Bob Grumman sez:

"Thanks to Aviva for posting something about visual poetry that I
suspect
Marjorie Perloff would agree with me on.  If the passage Aviva quotes
from Joseph M. Comte's UNENDING DESIGN: THE FORMS OF POSTMODERN POETRY
alleging that visual poets are competing with sound bites is
representative of his over-all view of contemporary visual poetry, he
needs a lot of help.  The passage is also stupid for dealing with the
presumed motives of some (unnamed or exemplified) poets rather than
their actual work.  It's not worth further attention."

Well, I enjoy being misidentified for one.  Misunderstood for another.
And largely unread (as a poetry "critickkk" I daresay I'm read far less
than the poets complaining on this list about how little they're read;
kudos, Jonathan Mayhew).

Frankly, I missed Aviva's quotation from Unending Design, but I'm glad
she at least read.  Obviously Bob Grumman hasn't, but it doesn't prevent
him spouting off about how much help we all require.

I second Marjorie.  She's done a tremendous service to the academy and
to visual poetics by devoting an entire seminar to that work, and what
does she get for her trouble?

You know, don't you.

Oh Henry. Or should I say, "Oh Dr. Lydgate." Or better still, "Oh
Dorothea." This has gotten boring. Let's both try to calm down. Thing is
I don't disagree with any of what you're saying about why one writes a
poem - that's all rather Obvious - I just find the way you say it
pompous and self-promoting - the very things you seem to be inveighing
against so vehemently. If there's a poet or critic on this List who
doesn't write "for luv" let him or her stand up now..... You see anyone?
I don't. But if you want to keep tilting at that windmill then by all
means, go ahead.

Don't relieve yourself too soon, Patrick.  You're barking up the wrong
fire hydrant (i.e. "we're all cronies here").  Nobody grabs the moral
high ground.  We're talking about conditions under which poetry is made.
And if you think running with the pack is going to get you somewhere,
think again.  They're headed for the dumpster.

Actually, I've never been aware of any influence of Publishers on my
work in any way shape or form.  Writers, yes - as writers, not as
pimps.  I'm worth more than you can ever afford, & besides, I'm
independent!

Academics fawn over their pets.  Publishers suck up to academics (they
order their books for courses).  Your contemporaries want to have a
good time being "writers". Do you want to write for any of these
people?  I write for love, love, love. Love is strong as death;
jealousy as cruel as the grave.

I don't know how I became "Joseph Mayhew," perhaps by correcting the
spelling of Joseph Conte's name.

The point is not that poets should feel grateful for critics who promote
their work, but that it is unrealistic to expect them not to.  From what
purist position does the charge of nepotism spring?

It is actually, an anti-story...no, a post-story.  A post-master-narrative

>Am I alone in thinking that the term "materiality" is often used in too
>reductive a sense?

Yes, i agree, even though I used the term in my last post; it's used most
often as a catch-all phrase for self-reflexivity which annoys me because
reflexivity is an act of consciousness, not of matter.

But i like the root of the word and i think there's some use in using it,
if you have the time to separate out what you don't want. The other
alternative, substituting another word like physicality, doesn't really
seem to solve the problem.

But terminology's terminology, it wears out, people put them on their head
and their feet and before you know they're no damn good for anything
anymore.

Physics and Biology are a different matter all together, they scoff at
thingy matter, try to flee from what I recently saw in print as "the
tyranny of matter" for reasons that are specific to that field. But the
virtuality of sub-atomic physics is something we have lived with in
language for many many years. What was poststructuralism if not a kind of
quantum linguistics?

my alphabet did this to me, please make it stop.

        Er, older thinker here. I'm sure that Ron Silliman has a good few
years on me.  As far as I know I am not on record in any public space
articulating any views concerning the "originality" of "young writers." I
did send something off to a journal a month or so ago, a short essay which
makes a few passing remarks concerning some of the questions pertaining to
generational conflict that show up on this list and elsewhere, so I guess
what's previously been conversation motivated by curiosity may eventually
show up as fragments in print. If I were to make a more pointed statement
about something as amorphous as younger or younger-than-Ron "generations"
I'd begin, as Steve Evans did and as I do in passing in this forthcoming
text, with the status of the institutional apparatus.  I'd want to talk not
just about the end of NEA funding but also about the declining cultural
capital of poetry in the university (among other subjects).  While what
Gary Sullivan says about younger women attuned to the proclivities of this
list finding jobs in academia seems right to me, this occurs against the
background of diminished space for poetry (of whatever variety) in the
university.  In the 8+ years I have been at my current university, to use a
local example, we have hired something like 15 literature faculty. None of
them does any work at all on any variety or "period" of poetry, nor do they
read it very much I think.  People such as Alan Golding, Maria Damon, Joe
Amato, Aldon and many others on this list pay attention to new writing in
non- or extra-academic settings because we are interested in it but also at
some cost. I'd want to add--recognizing I can't speak for all of these
people-- that the border space that we are more or less able and privileged
to occupy in moving between academic and non academic poetry communities
also has its advantages.  It might allow us to speak back to methodological
regimes in the university; it might portend the kind of future outlined a
while back in Miekal And's provocative but unremarked post. But one thing
seems fairly certain for the near future:  "younger poets" have had some of
the ground cut out from under them and will have to find other ground.
Intersections of performance and cultural studies offer one academic
possibility; there are others in and beyond the academy.  Turf for any kind
of contemporary poetry in the American academy is not that old in the first
place and we could argue about how solid or productive it's been in the
past.
        "Originality," in any of its senses--as meaning a new return to
known or obscured origins and models, as invention of modes more
consciously (or promoted and received as more consciously) without
precedent--interests me very much both as a question and in practice. I do
of course have opinions about the work of a variety of younger poets, and
this matter of "originality" might enter into them in a range of ways.  For
instance, I'll wonder about the interest in New York School pasts in such
and such a poet while comparing his or her work with some likely models
from among those pasts and thinking about their fate in varieties of
langpo-identified practices and the critical narratives aimed at
legitimating or promoting them.  But neither sense of the word is the sole
criterion in any evaluation or mapping that might be going on in this
bewildered head.  And the head is indeed bewildered swimming among prolific
and diverse work from very many poets coming onto the scene(s).  While I am
reluctant if not loathe to make generalizations capacious enough to refer
to "younger writers," I do understand the need for them--or at least their
attraction and their possible functions, coming from whatever
direction--and am periodically fascinated by the activity of watching them
gain currency and provoke counter-narratives.  I might even commit some
narratives to writing some day.
        It does seem to me entirely likely, following Miekal and others,
that what emerges with any force as "the new" will have to re-think the
apparatus, academic and otherwise, perhaps beginning with the big e.  I
wonder what generations mean on the e.  Maybe Joe Amato knows.  Or even
"information"--thinking back to a remark by Don Byrd critical of his own
and Ron's "generation."  I suspect that what Don meant by "information" was
something like "proposition" or "synthetic vision" as he was talking about
urgency and imminent ecological disaster (and as he did I thought about
Allen Fisher's work). Perhaps this was before you signed on.

You'll have to alert me to where such claims have been made and with such a
mobile definition of fascism.  And what's hypocritical about saying what
one thinks of specific younger writers?  You mean that it's just not nice
for Ron or anybody else to be critical?  One famous old fascist used to
write about how it wasn't necessary to respond to "the young" as I
remember; Ron does seem to be violating that decorum.  Perhaps he's been
too eager to generalize, I don't know (I haven't read "Philly Talks").  His
criticism, even if it is dismissive, indicates at least some engagement.
It will end up circulating the news about poets, whether or not they're
admired by Ron.  With 600+ readers on this listserv, simply mentioning or
discussing a "young writer" would go a ways toward reaching a significant
portion of the readers prepared at present to engage the work. Even here we
"participate in the larger socio-cultural discourse" like it or not.

Well I'm told the sidewalk's ready for Ron in Hollywood.  All that's left
is for him to dip his paws in the concrete.  I've never met him, but I'm
assuming he has paws.  It's early evening here today and he hasn't dipped
his paws into this conversation.

For Joseph M. Conte, here's the passage from your book that was posted,
and to which I perhaps too hastily responded:

"The concept of a poetic form must respond to the conditions of the
modern world and to an understanding of how that world functions.  Not
all "new" verse forms are equal to the task of confronting reality.
Poets may correctly observe that theirs is a printed medium requiring
the extended concentration of the reader; and they may also observe that
the audiovisual media that now dominate our culture offer an almost
instant gratification that barely requires the attention of its audience
at all.  Thus some poets have devoted their energies to producing
concrete or 'visual poetry' that could easily be flashed on a video
monitor, or they have composed 'sound poetry' that can be chanted like a
mantra, recorded, spliced, or broadcast over loudspeakers in some public
forum.  But in my opinion such poetic forms seem too much to bear the
stamp of their reality.  They are formal effects that seem not so much
devised by the poet as thrust upon him by the exigencies of his
condition.  They reflect a world that has grown too impatient to
tolerate the "defamiliarization," the increase in the "difficulty and
length of perception" that Victor Shklovsky argued poetic language ought
to pursue.  Such forms do not confront or interpret contemporary
reality; they submit to it."

To Joseph I confess that since you do use "some" to refer to the poets
doing visual and sound poems as the literary equivalent of sound bites,
you may not be saying, "some poets--the ones who do visual and sound
poetry," as I first thought (and which the context supports), but "some
poets who do visual and sound poetry do it superficially," etc., perhaps
I did misinterpret you.  Perhaps you were only chastizing bad visual
poets and sound poets rather than all visual and sound poets.

As for the help you might need, I did say that you needed it IF the
passage supplied was representative of your book as a whole (so far as
visual and sound poetry are concerned).  I continue to hope it isn't
since, at best, the passage deals only with an irrelevant minority of
the people in currently in visual and sound poetry.

This is reductive and I'm not complaining (yet). This is just a gander
at a factual answer.

I feel like Maria's questions are because most of the criticism tends to
be about male writers or tends to define the scene so as to give more
attention to the male writers. And as a critic you, Maria, read the
critical books and saw mainly men. Think about it: Hartley, Nealon,
Altieri, Conte, McHale, Monroe. (Perloff's work is some sort of
exception here and things are changing some--Perelman's book might show
some evidence of this.) It is not that these people don't talk about
women writers but just that more time has been spent defining various
poetries as products of male agency. (The story that L=A=N=G started the
movement; the story that "I HATE SPEECH" started the movement; the story
that Kit Robinson and Bob Perelman were doing some typing one day: these
are all stories that place men as active agents; the parallel stories
that Hejinian was doing Tuumba and that Scalapino was doing O and Fraser
was doing However have not been written as much.)

I am afraid that in the wee hours of the haunted night I have not
articulated my defense with the adequacy it deserves (besides, I was
drawn away from work on my 632-line ODE TO A SALTY TARMAC BY THE SEA,
in loose petroglyghs).

Jonathan Mayhew is correct, the charge of "nepotism" against critics who
promote living artists is without merit.  Let's use a different word:
corruption.  The critic who adds careerism and favoritism to the work of
criticism is corrupting literary values for everyone.  If I could, I would
symbolically cleanse the temple of the moneychangers. To critics or poets
who feel uneasy with the extremity (or perhaps obviousness?) of this
position, let me set your mind at ease: all I'm saying is, do your job.
Unless enthusiasm, gusto, interest, admiration and so forth are tempered
with dispassionate judgement, the critic is NOT doing the job.  Just give
me an independent critic, that's all I ask.  There must be a couple of them
out there.  The rest is a circus, a joke, a mirage, a distortion, ersatz.
That's what I've been saying all along.

Careerism & favoritism have their influence on the general audience for poetry.
But what got me started on this is the danger of careerism, literary politics,
and favoritism on the actual practice of making poetry.  Every poet who
cherishes their own work - takes what they're doing seriously - walks
an imaginary tightrope with every line.  Every line is the next step forward
in a total project.  Not everyone will agree, but for me this is partly
what lineation, concision, and rhythm are about.  I said it best in a
poem written over 15 years ago called "Hieroglyph", the last stanza of
which I will take the liberty to quote:

And it was only later, as we watched
his dry wooden boat slip underground,
that we understood the clean framing
of intention, the straight crossbeams
of its execution, that house of his
a kind of sounding board for praise.
Working across the tightrope of the
roofline was his way of walking on air.

If critics took their own work as seriously as some poets take theirs,
maybe the audience out there would take poetry more seriously too.

yes.

 Do you find women to be resistant to it, or hesitant to participate in its
culture?

hard to  generalize; i think it has as much to do with life opportunities,
formal and informal support systems (the "oldboy network" etc), and
traditionally gendered divisions of labor (a heterosexual couple meets in a
doctoral program; the guy's "career" progresses as the woman's gets put on
hold as she does the childcare, or she takes a job as an adjunct;
admittedly this follows an older model than is now followed, but it marked
the academy just earlier enough so that those guys are now full professors
and in administrative positions; it'll take another 10 years or so before
they retire, and of course, the gov't waived the mandatory retirement age
for academics a few years ago) --as with preferences.  of course there are
plenty of people who want nothing to do w/ academia, both men and women
--as a choice. but it's also true that there's a funneling that goes on;
lots of women in masters' programs, mfa programs, etc, fewer in phd
programs, tho often more than half of an incoming class will be women;
fewer still graduate w/ their doctorates; fewer still get tenure-track
jobs.  both men and women have every reason to be disgusted by academia,
but how is it slimier than, say, the corporate world, or the world of
heterosexual reproduction, or the public service sector --none of these is
mutually exclusive of course but one finds one's energies weighted toward
one or the other.

yes, see above comment. i think there's a funneling effect; there're probly
plenty of women students, but as you go up the ranks, there are fewer.
needless to say this isn't only true for white chicks like myself, in fact
we are more represented in the upper reaches of academe than people of
color of any gender.  the conference where i saw retallack and du plessis
featured only one speaker of color (male) and among the couple of hundred
registrants, i think 3 or 4 people of color.

this is true in a way, with reference to this particular scene.  i did take
workshops with levertov et al down at stanford, and picked people to be on
my doctoral committee who would let me do what i wanted --i.e. write as
luridly and lyrically as i do given the constraints of academic writing.
in general my slowness to be out as a "writer" has more to do with
self-consciousness and self-protectiveness; for example, i would never be
doing the collaboration w/ miekal except that *he* suggested it; i would
never have participated in the rengas that ran rampant here if i'd thought
of them as "serious" writing.  which in my case does have to do w/ gender,
but inflected somewhat differently from the above discussion.

Sorry about the Joseph, Jonathan.

Keith Tuma's (& Steve Evans's) perspective on the diminishing support for
poetry (how far can it drop?) makes this whole debate seem absurd &
solipsistic.  Along with KL, GS, and many others' contributions to
reality, specifics, & what's out there.

All this I grant.  Now I'll address your question.

The purist position I maintain is that poets themselves should judge what
meets their standards - both in their own writing and in the contemporary
scene.  And that there are powerful (relatively speaking) people willing
& able to talk ABOUT poetry (critics, scholars, writing teachers, program
directors, journalists, even a few poets - especially on the Poetics List
- especially ones whose names start with H) ad infinitum and ad nauseam.
By powerful I mean able to set syllabi, award grants, publish reviews,
advise on careers, organize anthologies, and so forth.

So? you say.  What do you expect?  Look at all these people interested
in poetry - ready to talk about it!  Shouldn't we be grateful?  Or as you
say - accept reality - stop being paranoid?  Bitter? Jealous, maybe?

No.  I will maintain against all comers: for the makers of poetry,
all that - all the po-biz - is nothing but pure, total, stinking
bullshit.  Because in the making of the poem - in the arena of
composition, where I began this whole thread - anything smacking of
P.R., officaldom, status, laurels, power, criticism, scholarship,
imitation, reward, theory, tradition, expectation, desire, ambition,
calculation, professionalism, money, connections, savvy, guile,
cronyism, prestige, politics, apprenticeship, nepotism, deals,
friends, gossip (anything, actually, other than death or taxes)
is - or it better be - irrelevant, or the poem is fake, DOA.
And don't tell me those things aren't out there. I'm not THAT
unrealistic. And pardon me: I write poems. I know just, just
how abject that sounds to every certified tenured intellectual.
The funny thing is they're not going to get it; they don't
MAKE poems.  - Henry Gould

If at any moment one examines the act of creation of the poem and applies the

Oh what's the difference: an infinity of island individuals or an infinity of
poetic communities (happening now;always will)? Only an economy of scale. And
thanks for that too. The only recourse in a society that abhors schools of
thought and clings to a false idea of individualism, which has been bastardized
with a materialist conformism, is "rugged individualism." Note that it is only
rugged because this individual suffers terribly at his/her own hands where
there is much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth, and not because there is
an eschewing of poetic influence.

Either way there is a field of unmarked graves. Only in the world of
institutionalized poetry (of which almost no one on this list appears to be a
part of), there is no tomb of the unknown poet. On this list, we see do see
tombs of unknown poets (or memorials) that are as eloquent as stones placed on
a mere mound of dirt. And curious the appearence of *action* in this context.
Check out Federico Garcia Lorca's thought on this (and Americans) in "A Poet in
New York." Essentially, the American idea of action didn't shuck and jive very
well with that of the Andalusian poet (and I agree with the latter). I mean the
(north) American idea of action (in the context of the real world of business,
money, po-business, etc) is impoverished spiritually, and is little more than
action for action sake. Lorca said that the busy upwardly mobile New York types
didn't have to "fight" for what they believed in (that they didn't internalize
the struggle). So it was that they were living someone elses life and speaking
with someone elses words. Given that non-idea of action, I choose against
action, which although it may sound like an old, worn out poetic impulse, it is
timeless as such. This doesn't mean that I am going to quit my job, but that my
soul is not for sale (or compromise).

Patrick, I'm really glad you agree with me.  You began by scoffing at the
idea that a writer might have a personal stake in originality or self-
respect that might possibly be threatened by nepotism, back-scratching,
the buddy system, groups in general; you thought it was naive that these
things might influence the scene.  But you've come around - that's the
main thing, and I don't give a flying buffalo chip what you think of my
style.  Pax.  I'm a pompous hypocrite - a list hog - so be it.
The main thing is, you've come around.  I'm surprised others
haven't said what you've said more often - I think it's because everybody
on the list is really nice (except for me & maybe that Bowering guy down
in Canada). Self-serving - that's the least of it!  Nobody ever
knows, much less tells, the whole truth.  The truth is I MARRIED into
poetry, REMARRIED WAY OUT of poetry, and have been having poetic affairs
(or trying to) IN poetry ever since!  It's worse than Plath-Hughes, only
the writing's better & nobody's died yet (me & Berryman just counted the
other day).  Ask Gwyn or Susan - they've actually read my stuff.  (Gwyn -
don't say anything before consulting my lawyer - let me give you his #
- 612-000-00hh - he's that bearded guy in the lumberjack shirt & fur hat -
Wayne McCornhusk - you've seen him on TV).  Probably it's familiar already to
8% of the younger generation and 53% of the older generation, but it makes
a helluva narrative, Dale.   - Henry Gould (more creepily personal than ever!)

Thanks are in order to Bob Grumman--at the expense of bandwidth--for
recontextualizing his comments and my writing as it was cross-posted to
this list.  I did say "some" poets working in aural/visual media c. 1988
(when I wrote the quoted passage), and though I had specific authors in
mind, I won't provide examples now, as then.

J. Spahr forwarded a critique from the ever-worthy CAP-L in which I was
pilloried for not having an appreciation of Web-based poetics.  But the
graphical interface for the Internet being nary five years old (as Loss
Glazier can confirm), I apologize for not being prescient about it ten
years ago.

In fact I'll be working with hypertext poetries and the EPC in a course
on Multimedia Literature next fall.

It's already a commonplace about discussion-list traffic that statements
ripped from their context are frequently misinterpreted.

Dear Tuma et al.,

My apologies for some of my attributions in my last message. I think that
this is the post to which I was primarily responding. I just got on the
list a week ago, and this was one of the first posts I received...
        I think almost all of the above is pretty off...

Keith:
Let me just say that I didn't meant to single you out at all--as old
or anything else. I felt like I had to name some specific sources of
current critiques of young writers (see my other message of today...
apologies.)

As per what you state above. I think this is a little bit off.
Yes. Perhaps poetry has suffered a reduction in the number of faculty
devoted to teaching it--but I would have to argue that this has been made
up for by the incredible proliferation of college-level writing workshop
and MFA programs. In the past forty years--and I think this cannot be
denied--poetry has become a larger presence in the academy. Personally, as
a writer, I prefer this kind of increase. Poetry is too often thought of
as the stuff of the past--workshops encourage young people to actually
participate in it as an artform rather than as the object of study.

Keith--

I don't think my definition of fascism is so very mobile:

The American Heritage defines it as "A system of government marked by a
totalitarian dictator, socioeconomic controls, suppression of the
opposition, and usually a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism..."

A fascist is defined as: "A reactionary or dictatorial person..."

I'm not about to say that any of the langpos--or any other poets--are true
fascists. But there is no question in my mind that some of them have been
belligerent.... some have the privilege of exercising socioeconomic
controls etc... (not to mention any kind of prestige factor is garnering
readings, good reviews etc....)

But I suppose the real issue is the work. I suppose that I may have gone
off a little bit because I would practically die for some of the "young
writers" working today--that I want people to keep their hands off of
their work so that they can continue to write the great work that they're
writing... I "need" their poems and get freaked when I feel like
anything--cultural, critical, or otherwise--might get in the way of it.

Or let me put it this way. Didn't Pound once say something along the lines
of "It doesn't matter who writes the great poems, as long as they are
written"?
        It seems to me that some writers might be better off being
lauded--some perhaps not--but that (and this is intuitive to a degree)
criticism (publically stated) is going to preclude more "great" poems than
it is going to encourage.

Keith--

Again apologies for being brash. I must say that I have this
attitude mainly because of things I've heard--that a number of primarily
male language poets in the 70s and 80s basically drove an entire
generation of young writers out of San Francisco because they were so
critical of them. Etc. I believe this stuff because I hear it from people
who know--and also because of the strange absence of young "experimental"
poets between the ages of 35 and 45 in SF...

I do think it's terrific when more experienced writers and thinkers
engage with less established minds and works--really terrific. I just
question the necessity of any order of pronouncement when it lands on the
head of person who has just begun to explore their potential--

All best regards,
Katy

I was wondering if anyone has an in-depth (or even cursory) knowledge of
"Asian American" (i realize the loadedness of this word and don't mean to
instigate much by this kind of categorization, but . . .) experimental

At home today with pneumonia (a relapse), I feel nearly as old as Katy
Lederer makes me sound. (Having broken a rib coughing makes it worse -- try
not to be funny for awhile, folks, cause it hurts to laugh.)

I'm intrigued at the responses I've gotten to that "prod" (more a nudge of
the elbow than the cattle model, thank you) as well as to variant, almost
parallel discourses hereabouts re visual poetry and the questions of
academic and/or pedagogic styles that have been swirling hereabouts.

Here are some thoughts from the rocking chair of the Home for Not Yet
Retired Poets:

Jeff Derksen made the point during our shared talk at the Writers House that
the larger sense of writing as a project that so many of us old fart
langpods seem to have had may have been a direct (or indirect) relation to
our experiences vis a vis the Vietnam War -- and, as I've noted elsewhere,
language poetry (so called so called), is indeed unimaginable without
Vietnam (every male poet, for example, had the direct experience of their
government trying to get them killed for several years, for no intelligible
reason whatsoever). The idea of a poetry that could change the world
(however much hubris may have been involved) was a direct consequence of a
world that need very much to change just to survive.

What is missing today, Jeff either suggested or else made evident through
implication -- I've not seen a transcript -- may be the social condition as
such. The social precondition, literally. There is no such social fact as
the Vietnam conflict now (and the alternatives, global warming, the Gulf War
[and redux], or the crisis of Clinton's pants, show precisely the gap). To
expect contemporary young poets to come up with a larger Project in a social
vaccuum is an unfair expectation.

I'm ready to buy a fair portion of that argument. It resonates, as they say.

Here I think the collapse of the American (and European) left post the fall
of Communism, big C, is very worth considering. For decades, many on the
left (me among them) had been saying that the biggest impediment to the
advance of the left was the presence of those various Stalinoid states. Now
they go away and instead of a renaissance of western left discourse, we get
nearly total silence, combined with a little confused muttering.

Now it may be that we are simply in the midst of a breath, a pause, as the
left listens finally to the silence left in the wake of the old Eastern
Bloc, and that after an appropriate period (10, 20 years?), it will take up
again, now freed from the constraints of those perverse but "actually
existing" examples.

Obviously, such a discourse will have some specific tasks that are already
clear:

To account for the problem of Stalinism and socialism-in-one-nation

To account for the problem of totalitarianism, per se

To explain how Marxism's explanatory capacity gives way to the problem that
Marx envision "one world" at least two centuries too soon -- and thus during
an industrial capitalist phase, when ultimately if it ever shows up (and it
may not, since it offers so much to the powers that be to keep it from
happening) it will be in a virtual or post-virtual world

To reexamine the problem of the nation as such (followed by classes, races,
gender)

To reexamine the possibility of discourse to impact the world under such
circumstances. (It is in this light that I am looking closely these days at
Steve Johnson's application of Althusser to the internet via his book and
the mag Feed, plus Manuel Castell's books on the information society, very
very closely.)

To reexamine what liberatory movements might then look like, and the
relationship of poetry thereto.

Just for starters.

I'm sorry if Ms. Lederer feels that the approach I've taken is ageist and
intellectualist (this is a new one). A lot of poets simply don't read
younger writers or, if they do, seem to make relatively little out of what
they read. My goal is to take younger writers absolutely seriously and to
make demands of them exactly as I do my peers (viz my comments to Bob
Perelman re his book published in the ILS issue devoted thereto) and my
elders. I feel certain that there will be those who not only rise to what I
imagine to be the occasion, but who completely surprise me and force me to
rethink and redefine the terms of the entire situation. That's what I'm
waiting anxiously to read.

As for my "stature," at a little under five foot ten, I am at least taller
than Paul Blackburn was by several inches. But compared with Olson or Kit
Robinson, this is an index that makes me nervous...

important point here, tom, and one which i agree with / with much web art
out there today, i often can't get past the "spectacle", a term which
seemed to have a lot of bearing in critical discussions of kinetic art in
the 60's / i agree that here we are (again) exploring new technical
possibilities in art / "aesthetics beyond the technical" is the challenge
both for theory and in practice / perhaps beginning with a trace of praxis
in visual-kinetic art in mid and late-mid century and investigating how
web-sculpting moves out of and beyond that / also the legacy of
visual-concrete / an interesting nexus or convergence, which to me takes on
new meaning in the visual-textual space of the computer: both static and
kinetic / motile...

That's _Moving Borders:  25 Years of Innovative Writing by Women,_ edited
by Mary Margaret Sloan.  A huge book.  I believe it starts with Niedecker
and works its way up to Lisa Robertson--and contains essays as well as
"work."  It will be out in March.  Small Press Traffic will be having a big
book party for it Thursday April 9.

Ron:

Could you post some more info re: your intriguing mention of Steve
Johnson's "application of Althusser to the internet"? Title of book
and some more about his mag Feed, which some of us haven't heard
about?

And I'm curious: in what sense is it a pressing task that the left
now "account" for Stalinism and the ways the doctrine of "socialism
in one country" was used to justify that barbarous monstrosity?
Trotsky wrote _The Revolution Betrayed_, which is the key work, and
there's been mountains written and theorized from a Marxist angle
since then. Or are you saying that history has proven Trotsky and his
followers almost completely right on the question of Stalinism and
that we need to read them now? Just a curious old trot here who spent
a good many hours of his youth selling The Militant outside factory
gates in Milwaukee...

But before anything, Ron, take care of that venerable rib. Don't
forget that you are an "actually existing" (poetically speaking)
Adam to many!

I like Ron's Big Thinking (even though he ignores whatever I have to say
about the limits of his "aesthetic").  It reminds me of Edwin Honig.
I don't think Ron's as old as Ed yet.  But they both think a lot about
Vietnam (maybe because Edwin fought in France in WW II even though the
FBI kept trying to have him recalled because since he was a Jew from Brooklyn
& had been to a couple "anarchist" meetings in the 30s he was considered
a Commie). Now that we're about to test our new missiles (much more accurate!)
in Iraq we remember "the more tings change..."

I guess I would say your blind spot Ron is the idea that the "movement"
(a lot of big Langpo readings in SF - men & women! in the late 70s)
was So Much Better & Real & Great & Happening & Important than what's
happening now.  As far as I'm concerned your movement was a failure
as political poetry.  Wake up & smell the coffee, old guy.  Poetry
will be political when it does a little better as poetry.  A place to
start would be to shuck these generational reminiscences & scattered
pigeon-like name-droppings that go by the name of "scholarship" or
"criticism" or "the academy".  It's a circus - there's the clown act,
& then there's the tightrope.

just for the record . . . when I arrived in the Bay area back around '87,
"older" poets widely regarded as Language poets were among the warmest with
their welcome -- despite their having had no reason to have heard my name
from anybody -- Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, Kit Robinson, Bob Perelman,
Carla Harryman, and others  I do not mean to insult by forgetting to name
them at the moment, have over the years since been really unselfish in
their encouragement -- quite a contrast to the "is this anyone important
enough for me to have to worry about" look I've seen in the eyes of so many
writers over the years --

AND, while I have not been checking out anybody's IDs, I believe I've met
any number of interesting poets 35-45 in SF who were not likely to be run
off by anybody -- Shauna Hannibal and Giovanni Singleton, whose work I've
learned of this year, certainly seem to be writing worthwhile work in that city

and if I might plug some related readings -- if anyone is going to read
Trotsky I would also like to suggest several writings of C.L.R. James, Raya
Dunayevskaya and Grace Lee Boggs --

Notes on Dialectics
State Capitalism and World Revolution
Facing Reality

and from France --

Cornelius Castoriadis had much of value to say on these subjects -- While
attending the MLA in Toronto I heard that Castoriadis had just died in
Paris --

Blackwell's Castoriadis reader has several relevant texts, written before
he decided for psychoanalysis!

Ron et al:

forgive me that i'm drunk enough to say this.

by which i mean, jeff didn't say this, *you* did -- the coincidence of an
earlier conversation about a line from bob perelmam ("is My Lai short for
'My Life'") serves as a reminder.  whilst jeff devoted much time to a
critique of the strategic (or rather, tactical) problematic of the "group"
aesthetic, he didn't appear to offer any kind of sociological explanation
for the what i suppose i'll have to get used to calling the "langpod"
phenomenon. time to quote, like one of mr. gould's nefarious critics:

According to rsillima@IX.NETCOM.COM:
>
> Jeff Derksen made the point during our shared talk at the Writers House that
> the larger sense of writing as a project that so many of us old fart
> langpods seem to have had may have been a direct (or indirect) relation to

> reason whatsoever). The idea of a poetry that could change the world
> (however much hubris may have been involved) was a direct consequence of a
> world that need very much to change just to survive.

this all reminds me, ron, of the final line of one of your essays --
"disappearance of the word"; an essay i still value very much, especially
as it introduced me to marx's wonderful "18th brumaire."  what was it you
invoked then: "the social revolution cannot take its poetry from the past
. . . but only from the future?"  this is the point of your *philly talks*
piece as i understand it; and whilst i agreed with you at the time about
the strategic value of the group formation, it seems invidious to co-opt
jeff's somewhat courageous resistance of your terms in this manner.

stop me before i repeat myself as farce,

matt hart.

I agree that there are a number of very kind language poets--
 I also agree that SF is absolutley packed with terrific young writers:
Darin De Stefano, Alex Cory, Pam Lu, Renne Gladman, Mary Burger, Lauren
Gudath and so on...but almost all of these (Shauna Hannibal is, I believe,
under thirty--and is, I don't think, not over 35--) are under 35. From my
perspective, when I lived in that area (between 1990 and 1995), most of
the newer writers were somehow or another associated with New College or
Berkeley--there was a pronounced absence of comparable writers over 35.
Some of these, I believe, were a tad reclusive---and some, like Drew
Gardner--moved away while I was there. But the overwhelming majority of
them seemed to have left long before. When I first visited New York, I was
shocked at how many of the interesting writers and thinkers of that scene
were in their thirties, among them: Eleni Sikelianos, Rob Fitterman, Bill
Luoma, Douglas Rothschild, Lisa Jarnot, Juliana Spahr and on and on. There
was no comparable group in Sf to speak of....

Katy

Summi Kaipa asks,

<< I was wondering if anyone has an in-depth (or even cursory) knowledge of
"Asian American" . . . experimental poets or "language" poets.  Anything
about this
topic would be of interest to me--any names that I could try to track down .
. . >>

One name worth mention is that of Arthur Tse -- who is (I believe) a second
generation (i.e., born in US, from parents born elsewhere) Chinese/American
poet based in Santa Fe.  I liked his book River/River.  More lately, a more
prolix little volume entitled *Archipalago* was published by Copper Canyon
Press --which unfortunately I've not yet taken time to peruse.

Also to mention:  John Yau (New York-based, when last I knew); he has much
work (e.g., *Hotel Sayonara*) published by Black Sparrow Press.

Both could likely fit within definitions of "experimental".  (I doubt if
either poet would dub himself a language poet per se.)

Also to consider: web-based concrete-poetry experiments (etc.) from Sounding
Gourd (a.k.a. Dajuin Yao -- a Chinese writer/artist/musician living in
Berkeley) -- see: http://www.sinologic.com/webart/
(note -- as appears after several intro-screens -- the "English"
toggle-option, which is worth using if one doesn't have a Chinese font on
one's browser)

hmm, Ron, I know what you mean when you say that there hasn't been
serious left discussions since the downfall of the East European
versions of communism. And, one shouldn't forget to add, the downfall of
various attempts at socialism — Moscow- or other- styled — in various
"Third World" countries. (The most horrid of such experiences being the
events in Algeria today).

And yet it also seems to me that there has been a major increase of
marxist or marxistoid discourse in the great sandbox of US academia,
much of it fashionably post-althusserian, much of it also — & maybe due
to the fact that that american hackademy's discourse's hold on reality
is so very slim — rather stalinist, i.e. a very vulgarian
totalitarianism hiding below the surface sophistication.

Although for the time being ensconced in academia, I certainly don't
feel much desire to be involved with that kind of rehash- discourse, and
wonder if the 10 / 20 years' time out isn't unavoidable — even if
deplorable, given the situation. Except for specific, local actions of
resistance and intervention that don't demand a long-term strategy.

Yes, let's hear it for Castoriadis — any Frenchman (well, by adoption) who
hasn't been pecked to stardom yet by the Great American Graduate Department,
can't be all bad. And indeed, Castoriadis is truly worthwhile read.

Katy Lederer--who has a lot of interesting stuff to say--has it wrong in
her vision of Language poets driving other experimental writers out of SF,
I'm happy to say. I can't think of a single case. There were some
"experimental" poets and writers of a different tendency who later moved
(David Levi Strauss comes to mind), and whose publishing efforts (e.g.
ACTS) subsided and whose writing slowed down (I haven't seen anything by
Levi in a long time, but he may be writing other than poetry). But, in this
case, it was the death of Robert Duncan, around whom the whole effort was
centered, that changed their world, not anything any of us did or said.

More accurately, Language poetry inspired a lot of other experimental
poets, some of whom became part of the tendency others just friendly to it:
I'm thinking of David Bromige, Lyn Hejinian (who was about 35 and had a few
books out already when she moved down from Willits to Berkeley to join the
fun), Kathy Fraser, and others.

Above all the vision of Ron Silliman as a fascist or as driving anyone away
from anywhere, if that's what Katy meant to suggest, is strictly
ridiculous. It doesn't accord at all with Ron's openness, friendliness,
wide circle of acquaintance, etc.

Certainly there were others who had a reputation for difficult
personalities, but were any of them more difficult than Robert Duncan? Life
is full of contradictions and conflict, yes? Generosity of mind and
achievement do not rule out a difficult even imperious personality, not in
my experience at least.

The essential Asian American experimental work is Theresa Hak Kyung
Cha's *Dictee*.  See also Walter Lew's *Dictee for Dicte.*  And *Writing
Self, Writing Nation*, essays on Dictee edited by Elaine Kim and Norma
Alarcon.

Other poets to try:
Tan Lin, *Lotion Bullwhip Giraffe*
Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge (sp?), various work.  There is an interview with
her in a recent issue of The Asian Pacific American Journal.
Myung Mi Kim, *Under Flag*, *Duras* (out yet?)
Lawson Fusao Inada, various poems in *Legends from Camp* and *Drawing
the Line* might be considered experimental if not langpo

Juliana Chang has an essay in a last year's issue of MELUS.  She makes
connections between language poetry and Asian American poetry, though I
can't remember if she does it in that essay.

Tom -- Levi is well & alive in the Mid-Hudson Valley (or in Kent's terms he
joined the Catskill school) & writing much excellent art criticism, some of it
in easily accessible places like The Nation.

((& sorry, Bertha, for leaving the real mountain people out but that was just
Kent's description of us as the Catskill school — I should have corrected his
misapprehensions  -- we're just lowly Hudson Valley bottom-feeders & shld thus

Hisashiburi desu ne. . .

I've just re-subbed to this list after a year or more of being unsubbed
thinking I was going to hear about something new, but I've tuned in to find
people are still writhing anxiously about language poetry hegemony.

Katy, whose version of the narrative is this? Exactly who are these "people
who know"? I'm 34 (so do I fit your category of "an entire generation"?)
and was in the thick of that scene for much of the 80's until I found
myself in Tokyo in '88.

Certainly I was not *driven out* by criticism from any of that number of
primarily male writers! (torches!) Who's granting them that power?  Who's
so sensitive as to be driven out of a city by criticism? I don't remember
any of them being critical of me, just encouraging. Maybe they thought I
was an acolyte? Dunno, I didn't feel like one. There may, I confess, have
been moments when I fancied myself a baby-language-poet-in-training, but
that was a passing phase -- I quickly realized the limits of that
self-characterization.  I do remember learning a lot.

Yes, that scene *was* sometimes joyless and constricting and abstruse,
socially clumsy or flushed with its own importance (the foregoing
modifiers could all apply to this list, couldn't they). Still, I and other
young writers were choosing to be around the language poets' whoosh of
intellectual energy.  No one forced us to be there, and no one drove us
out.  Most of the other young writers I hung out with at the time went back
to their hometowns or towards new opportunities, as I did -- San
Francisco's miniscule and overcrowded when it comes to job-hunting time.
Might be worthwhile to have a look at the economics & demographics of this
claim of "young poet flight."


A memory (1983?):

I remember Colette Lafia and I were taking a night class at SFSU from Barry
(Watten) on the Russian Formalists. He was driving us home (not driving us
*out*), and she and I were talking in the back seat about the class. He
turned around from the front seat and said, frustratedly,"I'm really having
a hard time getting you guys to understand what 'form' is" (not his exact
words).

and I'm still puzzling over that, what is form?

For me that's more interesting to think about than generational power and
poetry "politics."

And isn't it a good teacher whose question still resounds fifteen years later?

Blake was only ripping off Mahayana Buddhism--dig the crazy rap in the
Heart Sutra about "form is emptiness, emptiness is form," and then read

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Ron Silliman brings up so much important stuff about politix, that it's
hard to respond adequately....

I don't wanna dismiss the basic truth, that "social reality" is a central
component of what we do or don't do politically and socially...

But I've alwasy been a rather egregious example of what on the left is
called a "voluntrist."  No that doesn't mean I help out at my local
hospital gift shop without pay; it means I think that the most fundemental
part of getting something done is will, determination.  It's more
important that (now I'm gonna get real polemical, from many folks' point
of view) that we develop socialist and revolutionary (also seriously
feminist and anit-racist) values, than that some external *thing* come
along, like Vietnam, and swat us on the side of the head.  I hasten to add
the obvious: Ron S. has been a model of consistency, energy, eloquence,
and bullheadedness in representing the socialist edge, in theory and in
practice as a public intellectual and in his practice as a poet.  Indeed
in all these respects, has been a model for me.  But I don't think the
political *kick* the culture needs, and that we as poets need, is gonna
come from unexpected happenings.  Thus evocations of the vietnam era make
me uncomfortable.  It's gonna come from both our practice in our work as
poets and from all of us working to build popular movements with what time
we can spare outside our work.  For me, it has usually been the labor
movement plus a number of more specific attempts to at least inject the
beginning of social democratic ideas into the immediate sphere of shared
discourse, the place where working people like myself encounter Ted
Koppell and all those shambling corpses... (Recently, the Independent
Progressive Political Network, the Greens, the New Party and the Labor
Party, all with many faults but with a chance of reaching the public
sphere with slightly left ideas...)

In fact, from my point of view as a poet, it seems like political values
live, as part of the body of the work, when they are most internally
generated and intensely worked within the soul, within the mind.  whether
the left poet we are talking about is (to name some of my long-time
models) Vallejo, or Eluard, or Brecht,...or Silliman or Bernstein or
Harryman or Muller.  The sixties and Vietnam triggered a whole lotta
terrible political poetry precisely *because* there was an unmediated
response to an event that was considered *other* and wasn't linked to all
the human problems involved with trying to live and develop political
values in the core of one's own life..

Henry Gould makes some good points.  As for poetry as business, promotion
and the like, "I too dislike it," which is why the poems I write go
straight into my drawer.  How we could have a distribution system free of
the corruption he decries I have no idea, and would appreciate suggestions

Good point Juliana. This is indeed an oversight. Hank Lazer goes a good
ways toward addressing it in _Opposing Poetries_ which I highly
recommend to all and sundry. His chapters on Hejinian, Howe and above
all on Rachel Blau DuPlessis aim for a much-needed restoration of the
scales. I've already decided to write my senior thesis on the growth of
contemporary/experimental women poets, which will, I hope form the
nucleus of my PhD. dissertation (whenever the hell that happens - wish
it were now). I intend not only to examine Howe, Fraser, Dahlen,
DuPlessis, Hejinian,  Armantrout and other female poets more or less
associated with Langpo, but to focus on Mayer, Notley and Waldman, too.
And maybe their younger heirs. This is a large ticket to fill I know.
But I like thinking big. And I frankly think much of the most
interesting writing being done today is being by women.

This is reductive and I'm not complaining (yet). This is just a gander
at a factual answer.

I feel like Maria's questions are because most of the criticism tends to
be about male writers or tends to define the scene so as to give more
attention to the male writers. And as a critic you, Maria, read the
critical books and saw mainly men. Think about it: Hartley, Nealon,
Altieri, Conte, McHale, Monroe. (Perloff's work is some sort of
exception here and things are changing some--Perelman's book might show
some evidence of this.) It is not that these people don't talk about
women writers but just that more time has been spent defining various
poetries as products of male agency. (The story that L=A=N=G started the
movement; the story that "I HATE SPEECH" started the movement; the story
that Kit Robinson and Bob Perelman were doing some typing one day: these
are all stories that place men as active agents; the parallel stories
that Hejinian was doing Tuumba and that Scalapino was doing O and Fraser
was doing However have not been written as much.)

I know Acts is long gone, but when it folded (due to funding cutbacks if I
remember correctly) David Levi Strauss was still planning a special issue
called something like _The R.D. Book_, devoted to Duncan. Anyone know if
that actually came out? (if it did, then DLS stiffed me on my
subscription).
        Speaking of Acts: Anyone have a copy of the Spicer special issue
they are willing to let me borrow? (I'll pay postage both ways) It
apparently sold out rather quickly.

Re Ron's post yesterday:

I'd differ with Jeff Derksen by asserting that there are LOTS of projects,
plural, among younger writers. That the L=A=N=G thang jelled into a singular
recognizable project is contestable. Nevertheless, if as Mr Watten writ
"Identity is the cause of war" perhaps "we" don't want one. This may be a
possibility because of the multiplicty of influences available. The rather
incredible amount of engaging writing available just within the
Pound-Stein-Williams etc. tradition allows for such a variety of trajectories
among younger poets & within a single author's work that it will take quite a
bit of retrospect before "a project" could be identified. That this is the
case does not mean that Anselm Berrigan, Edmund Berrigan, Sherry Brennan, Lee
Ann Brown, Mary Burger, Steve Carll, Susan Clark, Kevin Davies, Jordan Davis,
Tim Davis, Buck Downs, Patrick Durgin, Heather Fuller, Peter Gizzi, Judith
Goldman, Lisa Jarnot, Andrew Levy, Bill Luoma, Jennifer Moxley, Melanie
Neilson, Sianne Ngai, Hoa Nuyen, Julie Patton, Lisa Robertson, Lisa Samuels,
Chris Stroffolino, Juliana Spahr, Rodrigo Toscano, Mark Wallace, Liz Willis,
&&& are not engaged in serious critical explorations which are shared & which
inform each others work. The work of the writers on the above list cannot
reasonably be reduced to the epithet "bland abstract lyric," it just can't.
Rather one might say that the context is wider, the number of influences
being drawn on & the insistence on the contingency of any given mode is
greater, that's all. This feeling that the context of the writing is wider
(which it is) may be a response to the obvious fact that the context for
actual political action-- for response at that level, has been shattered.
Macropolitically, the corporations have won. The evidence of these writers, I
think, is that micropolitically, they definitely have not. What that counts
for I cannot say, it is certainly a valid kind of resistance-- most
recognizably to overly codified modes of thinking about what poetry (i.e.
communication) is/can be within educational institutions & for that reason is
strongly allied to the continuing project of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E. Tho it perhaps
can/will have larger influence, so one hopes.

I've pointed this out before but will say again, another major difference is
the economic circumstance of this group. Re this question witness just the
book titles Edge has recently issued: _They Beat Me Over the Head With a
Sack_, _Nothing Happened and Besides I Wasn't There_, _perhaps this is a
rescue fantasy_, & forthcoming, _Marijuana Softdrink_. It is my contention
that there is much *NEW* (superscript tm) in this gen & it is informed by a
stunning listening in to an entire tradition which includes L=A=N=G coupled
with economic circumstances which often do not allow for the kind of lengthy
critical explication one might wish for. Or one might not. I'm not troubled
really by giving primacy to the poetic, if a writer's truly concentrated on
their work which genre they've chosen at the moment is not the point. It's a
matter of the degree of creative engagement, & there's plenty of that. I
would define "creative" to include "critical" by the way. & it may be that
identifying "a project" with the amount of discursive critical writing being
done is precisely the mistake. It's understandable that this might be thought
in the wake of or midst of L=A=N=G but it may be, um, wrong.

This is Kevin Killian (aet 45) . . . Like Katy I too have often noticed the
strange absence to young "experimental" poets between the ages of 35 and 45
in SF.  I think she's right on the money there, there is a great gap that
exists, and I too have often speculated on the reasons why.  But Katy, I
don't buy the explanation that male language poets drove these people out
of the city [OKAY I CAN THINK OF 1 or 2], and I wonder who the "people who
know" who told you this might be!  Many writers left the Bay Area for the
same reason you did--because after Berkeley, what else is there?  But there
are other reasons too for this gap.  Not only in poetry, not only in all
the arts, but in every occupation or avocation, there's a missing
generation, men and women who might have been 35 to 45 today but who
instead died of AIDS.  The new wave of miracle drugs that began circa 1991
have slowed the progress of HIV through the body, enabling seropositive
people to live longer and more productive lives; but before that, it was
like, you got the virus, you died, wham.  And many, many of the promising
poets and writers in San Francisco, where we enjoy and sometimes even reify
our drug use and high risk behaviors, simply died instead of filling the
gap that you and I both see.

There's another explanation too and that is IMHO many poets just simply
stop writing around the age of 30 or 35.  The younger poets who you would
kill for now are an exciting crew, but in ten years a third of them will
have given up poetry not due to squelching criticism, just due to -- mmm,
it's hard to say why.  [A second third will have taken their writing into
directions you will no longer respect.]   I notice this not only in my own
generation (since many of the writers whom I thought were genius, when I
first moved to San Francisco in 1980, are now silent) (and of course many
of them dead) but in other generations too.  (Writing the life of Jack
Spicer I saw how many brilliant poems were written by young men and women
who were between the ages of 20 and 35 in the forties, fifties, sixties,
and then for various reasons just stopped, period).  I wonder, looking at
an anthology like Juliana's and Peter's "Writing from the New Coast" how
many of the poets even in that book--who were the younger poets of five
years ago--have since stopped writing.  Or, as I look back on the poets
Dodie Bellamy and I have published in our zine, "Mirage #4/Period[ical],"
hundreds of them by now, and half of them must have been under thirty, I
look at the earlier issues and I go into a melancholy mist thinking, Too
bad X decided to become a full-time programmer, Too bad Y decided to write
for cable TV.  Tell you what, back channel me with your list of the young
poets of today who are writing the most exciting work and I'll keep it for
ten years, then you and I, sitting on our rockers, will uncover the time
capsule and work out who is still writing, what they're writing, and who
went on with it.

And one more thing, the absurd length of this post, it would be just as
fair to say that the language poets were themselves driven out of San
Francisco: one by one they all left us--though your advisors might say that
this is what has made the current re-birth of new poetry here possible?

And finally, and this is not only for Katy, but if any of you on this List
don't have that copy of Philly Talks with Ron Silliman and Jeff Derksen,
let me know (back channel) and I'll send it to you as supplies hold out.
It's really interesting and I personally would enjoy a wider discussion of
Jeff's announcement of the tendency, among "emerging" writers, "toward a
poetics if disgust and overdetermination."

Okay, see you.  XXX Kevin K.

The individual & group circus contortions poets go through to get attention
(both the "Language Poets" and myself are very good examples); the incestuous
and truly mystifying monopoly amalgamations of theory, criticism, scholarship,
and poetry that go on in the academy; the disdain & disinterest displayed
in humanities departments (of all places) for poetry; and the shell game/sell
game/name game that goes on in bookstores & journals... none of these things
are going to go away.  Who would want them to, really?  We all love the circus,
don't we? (When the acts don't make us scared or nauseous.)  Ah, blessed
literary spite...

But I think these symptoms & effects might be lessened or relieved by a strong
independent criticism.  I propose the formation of a World Union of Independent
Critics. The 1st principle would be that they would never meet as a group;
the 2nd that they would write about their personal friends only in a special
conversational genre called "Buddy Chats".  The 3rd principle would be that
these critics would care enough about poetry without being poets themselves
(I mean "full-time" poets) to do the following things in a very serious way:

1. These critics would educate themselves about poetry as a general field
stretching around the globe, running back to the origins of humanity, and
subject to new developments.

2. They would specialize in one or two areas for deep exploration.

3. They would interest themselves in the poetry of their own region,
and dedicate themselves to seeking out "unknown" and new work, or disregarded
old work.

4. They would cast an amused but cold eye on the maneuvers - personal,
political, aesthetic, professional, promotional - on poets & poetry groups,
always measuring new work & young poets within a framework or awareness
of DEVELOPMENT.  I.e. a dialectical sense: new young poets produce stunning
revolutionary work: how does it relate to the past?  what kind of individual
development/apprenticeship are they going through? do they have staying
power?  By the same token, the critic would look at strong, established
and productive poets, and ask: are they changing? getting any better? repeating
 themselves?

5. They would publish the results of their investigations, explorations,
responses, and theories in a modest format available to everybody.

6. They would keep a respectable distance from conflicts of interest,
tendentious promotion, and favoritism, by means of a proud dedication
to their OWN endeavor: an independent criticism interested in measuring
the values of what passes for literature and sharing them with the general
public.  Isn't this all we ask from any profession?  Why are literature
and poetry, poets and scholars, exempt from basic rules of order regarding
tendentious polemic and mystifying "theoretical" promotion?  The uses
of "names" as a substitute for the thing itself?  Those little blurbs
look so innocuous... they're poison, poison!!!!

hey joe; yeah, anyone can take any fragment of anything and use it in ways
not intended; the problem w/ exemplification in general, as b. perelman
astutely pointed out recently.  funny thing about cap-l; i didn't realize
they were open to new technologies.  glad to hear it.

Thanks for the reply, Katy. I can only agree with the clarity and
generosity of your response and your passionate yet measured defense of
supported, rather than challenged, creation, and I appreciate your
statement "I feel that perhaps it is fair to question this mode of or means
toward literary 'production.'", meaning the cattle prodding of younger
writers. The vital word here is 'question', as opposed to 'prod' or
'expect' or 'challenge' or 'judge'. Judgement is pretty sad if it gets in
the way of learning or teaching, and learning and teaching, if they are
cross-generational, should be working both ways.

My personal project with the list at the moment is to try to understand
just why the poetry scene is so stratified. Whatever language poetry and
visual poetry I've read over the last 20 years has been, to me, no
different than any other kind of poetry, and now I discover that it's
considered very different indeed. Well, I can't see a difference.

Mind you, I don't have a problem with Silliman's requests for a new poetics
of the Left, but I don't see it as having anything to do with the heirs of
his tradition. Things change and go off into unexpected directions, but
when they do so, they often leave other opportunities unexplored. There is,
in other words, everything right about asking for a new poetics of the
Left, just as there is everything right about extending Silliman's
tradition any way anyone sees fit.

The more tests there are for belonging to a group, the fewer members.  Over
time, the original tests for belonging become less relevant, and there is
attrition, as original members of the group begin to fail the tests/not
care/etc.  Sometimes the remaining members become more strident in their
membership demands, as in the Republican Party.  Some people don't like that
sense of "belonging".

Women are more socially mobile than men.

The idea that reviews be positive is absurd (in that way, it's kind of fun to
imagine).  Reviews are mostly pr nowadays.  Let's keep throwing in the
analysis.

Dear Silliman Joris, Hisashiburi et al.,

Let me say that I've been on this list about a week. It's been really
terrific as I'm a little bit isolated in some intellectual senses in
Iowa--

I'm a little bit baffled (perhaps baffled isn't the right word--) by the
number of responses that insist on correcting facts and setting social
issues straight. I mentioned two or three names in a couple of posts
replete with much larger questions and issues (ie, how to nurture young
talent, how poetry has changed in the last forty years institutionally,
what style might be...) and found a number of people who honed in on facts
and reputations that they thought were misrepresented...

I have nothing against "language poets"--Lyn Hejinian was probably the kindest
and most nurturing teacher I have ever had--In fact, my original post was
a lengthy Barthes quote about style--and was a defense of
langpos--

I suppose that I'll stick to the theoretical in future posts--

Yours,
Katy

Hello, again, Maria:

Many kind thanks for answering some of my questions. But it's really the last
one that I think might be most relevant, so I'll re-ask it: Given what you &
others have said w/respect to academia: What, specifically, now, could you
ACTIVELY DO to help further nudge things forward, toward balance? Is there a
way you might be able to use, for instance, the Talisman anthology Dodie and/or
Kevin mentioned (hi Kevin & Dodie!), like, create an event there at UMN to
somewhat coincide w/its publication? (I realize it would be difficult to get
something approved & planned for March or April.) I bet many of the academics &
non-academics on this list would be willing to participate in that, or anything
else for that matter. Though I agree with Henry Gould that the art-product, &
significant advancements of same, is made manifest, largely, by the individual,
I'm also intrigued by Don Byrd's take, similar to Henri Lefebvre's meditation
on cities, which makes a distinction between "product" (the home-made) and
"oeuvre" (the culturally- or communally-produced), and privileges the oeuvre.
So, again: What, specifically & generally--above & beyond the writings on
Kaufman, Women of the Beat Movement, etc. you've already done--can you do
toward ensuring the oeuvre of the academy reflects gender & racial balance?

Yours,

Gary

Kevin,

That was a totally great post--it's funny because here at Iowa there is
also a rather pervasive discourse regarding the "dropping out" of young
poets--

Marvin Bell et al periodically remind us that "even here, in the belly of
the poetic beast etc..." only about one out of every four of "us" will be
writing in 20 years--

Some of the younger poets I know also talk about this--
Anselm B. and I have had some interesting discussions about it, Hoa, Dale,
etc...

The interventions of death, though, have not been discussed much in my
circles--sobering thing to think about--

Thanks again for the post--it was thought-provoking

Love,
Katy

Length is not a criterion.  Neither is "economic circumstances" an excuse.
That sounds like a cop-out, Rod.  (Or a kind of blurb outfit for romantic
"short abstract french-cut lyrics by youngsters".)  But I agree that
CONCENTRATION ON YOUR WORK (critical or creative or cri/cre) is the thing.
And a ratio of more good poetry to less bad criticism is all to the good.

Henry:

Good show there below. However, both as a matter of principle and
in order to help ensure that the "Independent Critics" do not quickly
fall prey to the very ills they would courageously set out to do
battle against ("conflicts of interest, tendentious promotion,
favoritism, the uses of 'names' as a substitute for the thing
itself," etc), I would offer this additional qualifiction (sic) to
your little manifesto: This new "school" of critics will only present
critical considerations under a continuously shifting array of
heteronyms, with each critic limited to the use of a particular
"name" for only three attributions; subsequent to three attributions,
a "new" critic must be created. Don't you think? As they say, those
who critique should set the example. Or, as the good book says, let
he who is without sin remove the log from his own eye, or something
like that.

Thus, this new society of critics would be called "The World Union of
Independent and Apocryphal Critics." However, the fact is that such a
group would be a Johnny-come-lately sort of thing, for there is
already the recently formed and, yes, "actually existing"
International Society of Transpersonal Authorship, which includes a
number of critics, poets, fiction writers, and philosophers who write
roughly under the conditions I have outlined above. Most of these
writers are currently Russian, though other nationalities are already
on board.

By the way, that was one hell of a beautiful stanza, poet. What moved
your hand to brand it with your own name?

Kent (my name in the game, so you see my point?)



ON JANUARY 30, HENRY GOULD PROCLAIMED:

The individual & group circus contortions poets go through to get
attention (both the "Language Poets" and myself are very good
examples); the incestuous and truly mystifying monopoly amalgamations
of theory, criticism, scholarship, and poetry that go on in the
academy; the disdain & disinterest displayed in humanities departments
(of all places) for poetry; and the shell game/sell game/name game
that goes on in bookstores & journals... none of these things are
going to go away.  Who would want them to, really?  We all love the
circus, don't we? (When the acts don't make us scared or nauseous.)
Ah, blessed literary spite...

But I think these symptoms & effects might be lessened or relieved by
a strong independent criticism.  I propose the formation of a World
Union of Independent Critics. The 1st principle would be that they
would never meet as a group; the 2nd that they would write about their
personal friends only in a special conversational genre called "Buddy
Chats".  The 3rd principle would be that these critics would care
enough about poetry without being poets themselves (I mean "full-time"
poets) to do the following things in a very serious way:

1. These critics would educate themselves about poetry as a general
field stretching around the globe, running back to the origins of
humanity, and subject to new developments.

2. They would specialize in one or two areas for deep exploration.

3. They would interest themselves in the poetry of their own region,
and dedicate themselves to seeking out "unknown" and new work, or
disregarded old work.

4. They would cast an amused but cold eye on the maneuvers - personal,
political, aesthetic, professional, promotional - on poets & poetry
groups, always measuring new work & young poets within a framework or
awareness of DEVELOPMENT.  I.e. a dialectical sense: new young poets
produce stunning revolutionary work: how does it relate to the past?
what kind of individual development/apprenticeship are they going
through? do they have staying power?  By the same token, the critic
would look at strong, established and productive poets, and ask: are
they changing? getting any better? repeating
 themselves?

5. They would publish the results of their investigations,
explorations, responses, and theories in a modest format available to
everybody.

6. They would keep a respectable distance from conflicts of interest,
tendentious promotion, and favoritism, by means of a proud dedication
to their OWN endeavor: an independent criticism interested in
measuring the values of what passes for literature and sharing them
with the general public.  Isn't this all we ask from any profession?
Why are literature and poetry, poets and scholars, exempt from basic
rules of order regarding tendentious polemic and mystifying
"theoretical" promotion?  The uses of "names" as a substitute for the
thing itself?  Those little blurbs look so innocuous... they're
poison, poison!!!!

Maria, I didn't mean you.  Yes the ranting gets SLOPPY & BORING.  I was
thinking about the general phenomenon (is it a right-left brain thing?)
of people theorizing about a subject when they have no feel for the
process.  (There will be many who think I'm such a one myself.)  & the
process I was trying to emphasize (this is one place where FORM & POLITICS
connect) was the danger in poetry (imaginatively speaking).  "It can
kill a man."  I mean the tightrope quality of moving line to line,
when the poet puts his or her BODY ON THE LINE in the old sense
expressed in the phrase "a man of his word".  That's what I think of
when I think of the process of MAKING POEMS.  It can be lost sight
of in the teeming jungle atmosphere of world poetry production in this
day & age. It's a marvelous jungle indeed - you can take paths both
outward & inward.  But that being on the line through a whole lifetime
development is part of what I meant by the danger of being thrown off the
wire by irrelevancies or corruptions.  I'm not talking about influences.
I'm talking about selling out in various ways; being packaged; losing your
bearings.

Henry!

You missed something.

I propose the formation of a World Union of Circusses, to which all the
lion tamers, tightrope walkers, trapeeze artists, jugglers, clowns, gag
artists, clairvoyants, savants, and poodle groomers of the literary
establishment can happily belong, with the only requirement that they meet
continually, travel the world together, giving shows in towns small and
large, in countries rich and poor, selling popcorn for more than its worth,
and enticing the young to run away from home for a life of romance and
adventure.

Who could resist?

This in addition to your own World Union.

You see, I see a problem with this World Union. I'm sorry! I couldn't help
it! I see those pesky "Buddy Chats" becoming outrageously popular, because,
well, Oprah is popular too, gossip is popular, and trashy glitzy kitschy
gossip the most popular of all. I think the fifth column of people out for
a scurrilous time will subvert yr. good intentions.

I see too you don't want the poets in your group. They're going to snipe,
Henry. They're going to nip at your heels. They're going to infiltrate your
organization, and then they're actually going to meet over coffee. Boom!
The whole enterprise is wrecked. You're going to have to kick them out.
It's going to get petty. It will be awful. You might have to meet as a
group, in order to kick them out. You might need an executive body.

And executive bodies, we know these days, are much in the news. We'd never
be able to keep it quiet.

Don't get me wrong, I think your list of requirements for criticism is
admirable, but who's gonna give you the authority? Those excluded from
membership are going to attack your group in the same irrelevant way they
nit and pick their way through the incests and love nests of contemporary
incestual love-nesting, and there you'll be, building a bamboo sleeping
platform in some tree and picking nits with the best of them.

Crum, but it sounds like fun.

In the spirit of comradeship and the love of trees, I propose the
following:

1. We initiate Henry's Union of Independent Critics immediately, following
his 6 axioms to the T, because someone has to cut through the guff.

2. We start up the World Union of Circusses at the same time, because
someone has to guff.

3. While all that is going on, we get together here for coffee, free at
last from all those burdensome responsibilities.

Whatcha say, Henry?

I agree. A genre of truly tongue-in-cheek, ironic reviews would be a lot of
fun.

Dear Rod,

I really liked this take--

I think it seems especially accurate in light of what other new poets
elsewhere are up to (eg Iowa types)--

I know a number of newer writers who have mainly worked alone, or away
from the group you summon up in your post, who seem to be riffing off of
a lot of the same issues/aesthetics/dead poets that those of your group
riff off of--

Not to imply that there might be such a thing as a poetic control
group--but there kind of might be--

In this regard: Cf:

Of Piscator, Martin-Corless Smith (U of Georgia, 1st book)
The Little Door Slides Back, Jeff Clark (forthcoming from S & M, 1st book)
Anything by Emily Wilson, Ishmael Klein, Kelly Flynn, Nick Regiacorte,
Josh May, Kevin Larimer, etc--none of whom have a first book out yet--

Yours,
Katy

I've been meaning to do this for the last several days, but haven't had
time, and now don't have the book at hand, but:

Now published: Roy K. Kiyooka, PACIFIC WINDOWS: THE COLLECTED POEMS OF ROY
KIYOOKA. Vancouver: Talonbooks, 1997. This is a big, really beautiful
book, which contains all of Roy's earlier separate books--KYOTO AIRS, THE
FONTAINEBLEAU DREAM MACHINE, NEVERTHELESS THESE EYES, STONED GLOVES, THE
PEAR TREE POMES--everything but TRANSCANADA LETTERS, which was too
big and bulky to be included, but which, I think, is still available from
the press--plus previously unpublished or virtually unavailable work, plus
a critical essay by the editor of PACIFIC WINDOWS, Roy Miki. This is
really a fabulous book. It contains all of Roy K's illustrations for the
original editions, as well as David Bolduc's illustrations for PEAR TREE
POMES, all of which are in very beautiful color--and the illustrations are
clearer, richer and more resonant than in the original editions. This
book should be available from SPD (tho I just checked with Talonbooks and
SPD hasn't ordered it yet), but you can order it from General Distribution
Services. Here's the e-mail address: gdsinc@genpub.com

You can also order by toll free phone (within the U.S.): 1-800-805-1083,
or toll free fax: 1-800-481-6207. The price is $29.95 Canadian, $26.95
U.S. If you've been introduced to Roy's work only lately through e.g.
PREMONITIONS and you liked what you found there, there's much to explore.
Roy was better known in Canada as a painter and maker of assemblages of
many kinds, but for the past many years the writing community here in
Vancouver (and in select other places--the writers around Coach House
Press, for example) knew him as a fine, funny, enormously inventive and
elegant writer. He preferred to work, in writing anyway, on a relatively
small scale; most of his books were published in small editions by small
presses and are hard to get now; and he self-published many pieces in
small, hand-made editions of around 50 and gave them to friends. I think
many things remain unpublished -- his novelistic-essayistic treatment of
the life of Tom Thompson (one of the Canadian "Group of Seven") for
example, which some of us were lucky enough to hear at the Kootenay
School. His mother and father were first-generation immigrants to Canada
from Japan; his mother's stories, which are amazing, harrowing
expressions of life in turn-of-the-century Japan and early 20th century
Canada, were rendered from Japanese by Roy (via a literal
transcription/translation of the tapes which Roy made of his mother
telling the stories) into his own Canadian English-language versions.
They're now available, from NeWest Press, I think (Doug Barbour or George
Bowering, help me with this if you have the book), edited by Daphne
Marlatt. The book is called MOTHERTALK: LIFE STORIES OF MARY KIYOSHI
KIYOOKA. I don't have ordering info--maybe Doug or George can supply, or
I'll find and post later.

But this is all to say that Roy was--he died in 1994, age 67, I think--and
is a treasure of verbal and visual imagination. His written work is
available now in a way that it has never really been before, thanks to
Roy Miki and Talonbooks, and if you're interested in
the work of innovative writers/artists, his is not to be missed.

It's more

and

  It's gonna come from both our practice in our work as

all seems true / let me know if we're venturing into naming our causes --
not sure enough gets said on this list about the intersections of "poetry

Don Byrd and Joe Amato:I just caught up with your exchange and thought
it would be an appropriate time, Joe, to explain why I felt that physics
would remain at the center of the current controversies. It didn't
surprise me that a physicist, Paul Forman was chosen to critique The
Flight from Science and Reason. The history and necessary centrality of
the current controversy has its roots, in large part, in quantum theory
and its, as physicists themselves often call it, "counterintuitive"
phenomena. Crudely put these 'anti-Ockhamist' quantum events are four:1)
energy exists in discrete packets 2)wave/particle paradox 3)
position/momentun paradox and 4) influence of the observer upon the
observed. The 'counterintuitive' nature of these problems have led to a
huge body of theoretical speculation which for reasons involving, among
other things, the nature and capacities of language, can be fairly
described as 'metaphysical'and every participant in the current debate
is subject to these limitations and has demonstrated that fact
repeatedly in their publications. What is maddening about the current
controversy (and our hopes for an ecological solution)is that the
evolution and therefore pervasiveness of this speculation is being
ignored by all sides. A rough archaeology would look like this. 1)
Philosophical speculation introduced by the physicists responsible for
the fundamental discoveries in Quantum itself who are troubled by its
'counterintuitive' nature--Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein, Bridgman, de
Broglie, von Neumann and many, many more 2) then came philosophical and
philisophico-historical exegesis and the introduction of the problems
involved in a reliance on formal or quantized systems--Husserl,
Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Hayek, Hansen, Reichenbach, Whitehead,
Oakeshott, Feyerabend, Rorty and many, many more 3) then the Frankfurt
School and the broadening to the social paradigm and a sharp critique of
formal systems--Horkheimer, Adorno, Habermas and others 4) finally,
deconstruction--Derrida, Foucault, Latour et al.
This, in turn, is the inheritance of the debate born out of European
Transcendental philosophy, enlightenment science, British empiricism
etc. and in conflict with Realism and Logical Positivism (before its
collapse the philosophical Xanadu for scientists that wanted a system of
language that banished all metaphysical elements and paralleled the
certainty said to inhabit mathematics---see Gross and Levitt, Higher
Superstition on A. J. Ayer for a sense of how ill-informed these cats
are) and the positivist adjustments found in Popper, Quine, Lakatos and
many others. The importance of the fundamental questions surrounding
these early 20th century physical discoveries is beyond question as well
as unresolved. The influence of physics upon our daily lives is
irrefutable. That a critical assessment of the contradictions and tenets
as well as the technological fruits of the dicoveries of physics has
taken on a new urgency is borne out by Don's World Watch citation.
For decades I have endeavored to put this debate into poetic form if
only because it is utterly fundamental to all that we experience and how
we interpret that experience. Generally, my response from literary and
academic editors runs like this 1)we are not sure what it is you are
doing 2) but we are certain that you are not doing it well. People in
the sciences tell me that they do not need an historical or
hermeneutical perspective to do their jobs effectively which jobs here
in Washington are overwhelming defense or regulatory related.
My work draws (or, I should say drew) heavily from the modernist forms
embodied in Pound, Olson, Duncan, Zukofsky, Jones, Johnson et al because
with the modernist mode you can build with original source material, a
philosophical dialectic subtle and supple enough to advance a series of
positions and conclusions. With the modernist form you can layer a
tectonics of quoted material, image etc. allowing them to heat up as
they come in the contact with one another. You can thus create unique
arguments and reveal new syntheses. You can retain sense in the
modernist mode without sacrificing the profundity of either the original
argumentation or your reconstruction. The modernist mode is outward
looking engaging some of the best of what has been thought encouraging
the poet to increase the size and scope of his own thought. Modernism
kicks the self-centeredness, naivete and sentimentality right out of
you. And I've only begun to extoll its virtues.
Don, its the ideal form for the kind of poetry you are looking for and
from what I can judge have on occasion, written. The "urgency" that you
talk about IS being addressed. The opportunities to experience it are
another matter.---Carlo Parcelli

Subject:      A Parable about a Pair a Bulls

There was a cowboy once by the name of J (not Jack; just J).  Out on
the prairie one day he saw a herd of Bulls.  There was one big Bull named
Henry; he wore a purple hat between his horns & was lecturing the
herd as they moved along day after day.  He trumpeted his lectures
on a third horn between his two horns under his purple hat; everybody
listened carefully.  He cried, "Bulls, you are not to travel in
herds anymore!  You are to carry these Henry Packs on your backs
and follow me!"

J wondered: is Henry the Bull a small town boy?  Suddenly with a tremendous
bullish roar the whole herd including Henry pummelled pell-mell over a
cliff.  J rode over to the edge & picked up a Henry Pack.  It was
extremely heavy; J thought: oy, the burdens he laid on their backs!
Better for them to go right over the cliff than carry one of these!
J opened the Pack.  Inside he found a faded manuscript written on
8 x 11" legal pad with black ink.  In block letters across the top
he read:  THE POEMS OF HENRY THE BULL. J thought: maybe I'll get to
this one of these days... & he rode off into the sunset, singing
"Row Row Row Your Boat"*

*according to Eric Blarnes of the Univ. of Left Overbie, this familiar
folk song is the most profound work of literature in the English language.

        "hen" & Rod,
        The question becomes, to what degree does one's writing attain to
a social function (not a role, a function).  The role of poet or of critic
would seem to imply that their function is social.  Socio-economic
distinctions do not register a "cop-out" insofar as one creates for and
within turbulent and inequitable social matrices.  And this inequity
cannot easily be said to be innocuous in our distinctions between "good"
and bad creative and critical work.
        If I understand Rod's argument, it's that it's difficult(er) to
formulate or recognize a unified "project" in some of today's writing, as
opposed to that there Langpod hoedown of a few years back.  It's tough to
cop out of a project which was never undertaken.

Isn't this coercion of "economic circumstances" into
low-pressure relevance via "CONCENTRATION ON..[etc]", really quite
drearily enthusiastic?  An explanation - however partial or specific -
need not be an "excuse".  How is your concentration enabled, what are the
qualities of its persistence, what are the material situations of its
effectiveness?  The old "cop-out" accusation can also be an
uninterestingly reflex gesture of self-aggrandizement.

By Ishmael Klein:
(From Gare du Nord, Notley and Oliver, eds.)



        Where Everything Waits


Nobody was left who'd lastly scuffed first earth's crust.
Boiling sea had thin-sheened each cubit of firmament.
Mountains ceased to assert, gave in to ground
arounding whatever hard rock
to then there-over and taken down.

All shapes breaking hysterical particles and subs who settled;
devoting former whirr of shape to Silence
which was enough.

It stayed uniform Silent for some many months
which strengthened to pull outerspace noise in to neutralize
but lost its grip.

So this Sound hard pressed in to sink holes
and look into original force that was still shut up
under black lacquer cabinetry: our future perfect world.

It opened door of dust,
the space Sound, picked up pings distantly.
Seeing to sound is what and how Bounceback.

Since the dust so still and small,
this wave skinnied high-pitched
to switch on resistance of an average mote.

What would stand to receive?
What was the point of pointing to resisting decay?
What was there to say?

Could anything be activated?
Much was strained in "done" state and so sought exit through soft
Silence under rather than be stabbed by point-cornered Silence above.

So sound deranged to be
needle pierce to dust piece
and sunned a word heard first by the bygone ("ouch").

And the Silence, started by the sneaking sound,
forgot its own high ground
and grumbled some rebuke.

Underground the glad particulates
laughed at the gaff and stretched as to seem
(something among it a voice) to sweep up what had been:


II

One in Dust begun

One chased out Perceptivity from mum.

This made and In so such could close

over after outreach which comes back with something to stay.

Stretching comes to the zone where is shifting

from mixing its own x-space with outside sensed data.

Each already edgy piece in "earshot"
each piece pulled in by dust's desire to harbor more.

Similar to dolphin noise the riffs that began off flats of static

f.p. earth, those etched by rust-hinge-close sound, insecure.

Not all dust took in.

Those who did not got ultra dense.

If there were a strike to this one specie,

sparks would three feet, at least, and atoms.

To them strike relieves adhesion.

They like hits from nowhere; they won't admit their Hard

it's in every space.

   One thing I've been thinking about lately that might tie in with
   some of the points Kevin Killian raises is this:
   Isn't it a little too early to complain about poets of (I guess)
   "my generation" that have "dropped out"? Maybe I only speak for myself
   here (maybe not), but when one thinks of Oppen's alleged 30 year
   hiatus, or the fact that Stevens didn't publish his first book until
   he was 44 (and had his economic life together) and then didn't write
   a poem for 6 years or so (while Holly was born and toddled etc.)---
   (kinda like John Lennon's househusband phase? "watching the wheels"
    ah the courage to say "everybody seems to think I'm lazy/ I don't
    mind I think they're crazy") or Dylan's basement tape/nashville sky-
    line "drop out period" ("just who were you expectin'? jesus zimmerman?
    ) and the examples could proliferate,
    considering this, considering the sometimes really silly pressures
    poets place on other poets or on themeselves (or maybe the "agent"
    that places these pressures is just some idea of productivity, some
    puritan ethic, some spurious "conscience", some idea of the career
    of the poet, the way the idea of the POET gets in the way, becomes
    perhaps at times somewhat debilitating, a question of aesthetic
    reputation), one may wonder and maybe it would be worthwhile to
    investigate exactly what is meant by "poetic commitment".
    So now that I've perhaps come off like an "EXASPERATING" killjoy,
    codger of sorts, let me say that I am not interested in preventing
    anybody from NOT "dropping out", but I do want to "rise" to a defense
    of those who may have dropped out (and I'm not naming names right now,
    names are not exactly what i feel is at stake here), or may have
    seemed to drop out. Dropped out from WHAT? is I believe a valid
    question. I don't know if anybody else here has felt that there's
    sometimes when it's very important to "lay fallow" as it were and
    maybe even WILL or FORCE oneself NOT to write, recognizing that there
    are, at certain times at least in ones life, when the enthusiasm to
    write write write fight fight fight publish publish publish (and in
    "the right places" at that) may become counterproductive, get in the
    way, when (dare I say this today, when LESS IS MORE), etc.
    and this can go many different ways, in many different directions,
    but i'm curious where you, oh dear collective of listers, might take
it. Thank you, Chris Stroffolino

Summi:

Tan Lin has done some really interesting work ("Lotion Bullwhip
Giraffe"--someone correct me if that's wrong--is out from Sun & Moon)
that's appeared in a number of Asian-American litmags.  Of course,
there's John Yau's work, which isn't "language" per se but definitely has
to come into any consideration of As-Am experimental poetry.  The
anthology "Premonitions" from Kaya Press is also something you should
look into.

This whole question of Asian-American/experimental poetry interests me
too.  I've had some trouble reconciling my interests in both sides of
this term; so much of what passes for As-Am poetry seems like the same
safe, tired, personal-lyric formula with a few of the major terms changed
around to signal its Asianness (trips to Chinatown for baseball games
w/dad, etc., a fixation on food--apparently all we Asian-Americans do is
cook and eat and have our parents teach us traditional dishes).  But then
how does the Asian-American "identity" of an author work into something
that's less obviously personal/narrative?  (I suppose that the whole
debate can get absorbed as material for the work; I get the feeling that
Yau's done interesting things with that, but I'm not familiar enough with
him to say.)

Anyhow, hope this helps.

        I am aware of the disinterest (such disinterest there is little disdain).
I am not aware, however, of mystifying monopoly amalgamations.  Am I missing some
thing?  There have been a few  books on contemporary poetry by academics in recent
years, three or four of them by poet-academics on this list, and there is an
occasional article in a literary journal.  But what do you mean?  M.P. talking
language poetry in her never-ending lecture tour?  I do not see how the miseries of
poetry can be blamed on criticism.  I would insist there is no significant amount
of criticism.  There aren't even any reviews to speak of.

          Do you really think, Henry, that we have some  rules for an objective
criticism?  I will completely agree that too many of the few people who undertake
to write about poery are demonstrably ignorant.  I would say that at least 2/3 of
the books on contemporary poetry written in the past twenty years prove only that
their authors should NOT be tenured (and that those books secured them tenure
shows how sadly bankrupt the system is), but when you say  that you ideal critics
"would keep a respectable distance from conflicts of interest, tendentious
promotion, and favoritism, by means of a proud dedication
to their OWN endeavor: an independent criticism interested in measuring the values
of what passes for literature and sharing them with the general public," I have my
doubts.

        I get out my poetryometer (it was in the lab I got the key to when I got
tenure) and measure the work of all the young poets.  H.G. gets 9.5 on originality;
9.3 on structure,
9.9 on emotional intensity, 9.7 for ear for "daemonic laughter from distant
Rockies."

        I think it would be better for people to write about their friends.

            Don

                Many years ago, Leslie Fiedler was proposing a new school of
criticism, the tenets of which were that all critical judgements must be
obscene, negative, and brief. His illustration was a take on  _Paradise Lost_:
too fucking long.

Yes. Okay. Roger that. But just for the record - and maybe I was being
too oblique - I never scoffed at the idea of integrity in writing (or
anything else) - I was skeptical, however, that anyone "gets anywhere"
on their own. To write a poem, even in utmost secrecy is - if you're at
all serious - to use a language already ancient in its poetic accruals:
is to engage with the living presence of the dead - and also, your
living contemporaries. As for publishing: that takes luck, connection,
timing, persistence, canniness and even possibly a modicum of skill,
maybe... (Whatever it takes, it's still eluding me! But, as you rightly
say, that's not "the why" of writing a poem). In any event, it takes
_other people_.

Patrick, I'm really glad you agree with me.  You began by scoffing at
the
idea that a writer might have a personal stake in originality or self-
respect that might possibly be threatened by nepotism, back-scratching,
the buddy system, groups in general; you thought it was naive that these
things might influence the scene.  But you've come around - that's the
main thing, and I don't give a flying buffalo chip what you think of my
style.  Pax.  I'm a pompous hypocrite - a list hog - so be it.
The main thing is, you've come around.  I'm surprised others
haven't said what you've said more often - I think it's because
everybody
on the list is really nice (except for me & maybe that Bowering guy down
in Canada). Self-serving - that's the least of it!  Nobody ever
knows, much less tells, the whole truth.  The truth is I MARRIED into
poetry, REMARRIED WAY OUT of poetry, and have been having poetic affairs
(or trying to) IN poetry ever since!  It's worse than Plath-Hughes, only
the writing's better & nobody's died yet (me & Berryman just counted the
other day).  Ask Gwyn or Susan - they've actually read my stuff.  (Gwyn
-
don't say anything before consulting my lawyer - let me give you his #
 - 612-000-00hh - he's that bearded guy in the lumberjack shirt & fur
hat -
Wayne McCornhusk - you've seen him on TV).  Probably it's familiar
already to
8% of the younger generation and 53% of the older generation, but it
makes
a helluva narrative, Dale.   - Henry Gould (more creepily personal than
ever!)

    investigate exactly what is meant by "poetic commitment".

I recall an article in the Wall Street Journal concerning Jordan Davis'
project to write a million poems (or something like that). How is that going
Jordan?

I also recall leaving a party after a discussion with Bruce Andrews about
computers versus typewriters (guess which one he uses) and other matters
including this list. His parting line was something to the effect of "now
it's time to write a thousands lines." I took him seriously in the sense
that he's fairly prolific. It was like he was saying "okay, partytime is
over. Enough talk. Now go and write."

which I find splendid, a splendid correction, for myself certainly not
seeing the wood for the trees (and then again, the trees for the wood),
admirably concise and plangent outline of the history & not only of
modernism, I would add (since Carlo stops with that term) but of the
postModern (and I would be interested to read someone of Carlo's abilities
who wants to insert other authorities to give some account of the
difference between these two terms. "Counter-intuitive" requirements are
what makes common sense so, uh, common, and so short in, um, sense. The
entire appeal to intuition & common sense, spirals downward into bad temper
("why all these long words?") and barbarism ("Duh. . .") with which, among
other minorities, intellectuals are attacked. Adorno liked to cite the tale
of Mahler's donkey, which never met another donkey it didnt like, but had a
hard time with modern music (I'm paraphrasing wildly here : someone got the
correct quote?)

Reading this post of his, for me the whole constellance of debates _lifted_
,I remembered what I'm here for--and hope others feel likewise. More on
this soon I hope, David.

Spandrift:

Your parable reminds me of an old Uruguayan saying, which begins,
"Beware of the bull with three horns." I wish I could remember the
rest, but I can't. But I do remember once when I was 19, being at a
barbecue in Punta del Este before it was totally trashed by the
Brazilian and Argentinian jet set. It was a big party of young YMCA
members, about 25 of us, and everyone got a big hunk of fairly rare
meat with the hide and fur still attached. I remember watching the 17
year old girl I loved pick this up in her hands and chew and laugh.
A kid, about the same age, picked up a guitar and started to sing a
song by Daniel Viglieti, whose music was banned at the time, and
everyone joined in, singing. By and by a black van and car both full
of plainclothes cops arrived and started arresting everybody, and the
kid with the guitar, who started to complain, got a long, black club
across the face. The cop who was dragging away the girl I loved
conveniently grabbed her breasts, and I stepped forward and yelled
Hey! But then I didn't say anything more, afraid that I might get hit
too. She tried to kick and punch back, but to no avail. She
screamed at them that they were fascist pigs. The van drove away.

It was me and three or four 12 year olds who didn't get taken in. I
was American, so the cops just took down some info and told me to
watch it. OK, I said, I will. I took the bus back to Montevideo.

About two weeks later I saw the girl back at the Y. Our eyes met and
then she quickly turned away. I started to say something
but only half of it got out. Here and there I saw her a few times,
but never spoke to her again. The kid playing the guitar was in for
more than two years. No one died. I have no idea why in the world I'm
saying this on this list. I know my posts are sometimes among the
most idiosyncratic here and certainly not among the most esteemed. I
don't fault anyone for that. In fact, I have come somehow to even
like those who don't like me! Isn't that strange? But what is wrong
with me? Forgive me for this creepily personal post! Something about
not remembering the old saying about the bull with three horns draws
me to say it, and also to remember the way that beautiful girl turned
her eyes from me. It occurs to me now that if it weren't for what
happened then that I wouldn't be typing this now on this list,
whatever it might mean. It occurs to me that it turned me into
everything that I became. I guess that sounds trite. And yes, ok, so
I'm feeling a bit embarrassed, not very polished or admirable at all,
aware that even this candor is another sad way of demeaning myself
before all of you.

Oh, I really did feel like jumping over the cliff. Still do,
actually. I wish poetry was a parachute that worked, but it doesn't,
not when the cliff is real. I wanted, Henry, to say to you at the
end, "Here, Henry, here is your purple hat." But now I don't want
to say that--at least not in the clever way that I'd planned. Now I
am feeling a little sad, sad for us both, but mostly selfishly sad
for myself, and I feel like being quiet for a long while. I know
that you might well be thinking that I don't need to be sad for you,
and of course you would be right. And I guess in the end, after all
this time, after all those years of trying to forget, that's all that
I have to say about that half-remembered saying.

Hi Henry. Hi Kent. I like this idea by god. But I think you should call
it the Utopian World Union of Indie Critics. They'll have a secret HQ
the whereabouts of which are unknown to any of them. We could also
abolish all self-interest too and hell, why not, world hunger while
we're at it. Who wouldn't want that? Well - lots of people I suppose.
David Brinkely might get upset on both counts!

Seriously, though. It's amusing to think of a kind of blurbless blurb
i.e. one without any attribution. Grosse Gott how would we know what to
THINK? But for this to happen, really and truly, posits a radical series
of sweeping cultural changes that would also end racism, sexism,
fascism, etc etc etc. In other words, in the mutually interdependent
world of the ten kajillion things, you can't have the one without all
the others too. What you're really talking about is the end of a
capital-based society - the end of the opposition between purity of
vocation and Mammon - and a return to a gift economy. Well not really a
return, but...  Ja love, y'all.

To Chris Stroffolino: I heard Mark DuCharme read a piece last night he
collaborated with you on. Great stuff - didn't get a chance to talk to
him, he ducked out immediately after.

Maria, I didn't mean you.  Yes the ranting gets SLOPPY & BORING.  I was
thinking about the general phenomenon (is it a right-left brain thing?)
of people theorizing about a subject when they have no feel for the
process.  (There will be many who think I'm such a one myself.)  & the
process I was trying to emphasize (this is one place where FORM &
POLITICS
connect) was the danger in poetry (imaginatively speaking).  "It can
kill a man."  I mean the tightrope quality of moving line to line,
when the poet puts his or her BODY ON THE LINE in the old sense
expressed in the phrase "a man of his word".  That's what I think of
when I think of the process of MAKING POEMS.  It can be lost sight
of in the teeming jungle atmosphere of world poetry production in this
day & age. It's a marvelous jungle indeed - you can take paths both
outward & inward.  But that being on the line through a whole lifetime
development is part of what I meant by the danger of being thrown off
the
wire by irrelevancies or corruptions.  I'm not talking about influences.
I'm talking about selling out in various ways; being packaged; losing
your
bearings.

To reply to Maria's reply to my post -

I think there is a difference in the thinking that produces an academic
essay or career and the thinking that produces poetry and/or essays that
would not be legible to most in academia. Some feel quite strongly about
this - Robert Duncan was one. The first time I met him was in Tom
Parkinson's class at Cal and Duncan spent a half hour or maybe an hour
attacking all academics - esp Tom - It's an old list argument I know. But
I do think the critic or editor, academic or not, has the responsibility
to find the work and the people. Men submit more to non so I ask the women
two times, three times - I myself am often reticent and I know some male
writers who are that way - But one must be relentless.

I think legibility is a key point - A group or generation provides a
context - Sometimes you have to read alot of new writing to get what
people are about - What they are doing that doesn't seem new but actually
has changed everything -

And to Katy and others (btw Katy, great magazine!)

I've been in the Bay Area forever (well since 73) and there has never not
been a lot going on - Jimmy & Lucy's House of K, Big Allis, and Ottotole
 are among the mags that were edited by and/or published many in the
supposedly absent generation - jeez some of my best friends are in that
gen - Not to mention myself who at 45 and, in the *younger-person*
anthologies, am the same age as some of the old ones, as well the same age
as of some of the *younger* ones -

It's also true what Chris Stroff said - Sometimes you have to take a few
years off to have a kid, or help someone die or make some money etc -

Don, and others (I've been asked to amalgamate my messages):
A while back there was an electronic journal outa Buffalo: there was somebody
writing reviews under the pseudonym of Edgar Allan Poe.  That pseudonymous
personage was onto something.  She or he was AMALGAMATING several of the
list responses to my World Indie Critics proposal.  Kent: it was a pseudonym.
Harold: it was a circus (it was a clown on a tightrope).  Patrick: it was
Indie in the Utopian critical sense. And Don: it was taking contemporary
poetry seriously while "keeping a distance".

I live in a small New England city with one big Ivy League U.  At this U
we have a prestigious MFA program.  In this MFA program we have a "mainstream"
element (CD Wright et al) and an "avant-garde" element (the Waldrops et al.)
Both, oddly enough, emerging out of Arkansas (WHAT DOES THIS MEAN???) or
thereabouts (See Keith's intriguing memoir LIGHT WHILE THERE IS LIGHT).

I'm not a good scholar.  You could say I'm a typical narcissistic
artist type. But my gut feeling is there is a homemade poetry group
industry & a homemade collegiate MFA industry & a homemade P.R. industry
for poetry nationwide (U.S.), in Don's term "homemade".  In consequence
for various idealistic & self-serving motives a lot of ALLOWANCES are made
for this little fishbowl.

The strategy I am proposing is the "Edgar Allan Poe" strategy.  Let there
be critics who, even though they write about their friends, PRETEND (pseu-
donymously) to maintain Indie critical standards. Let there be a little
decency in the fishbowl; let it not be nice people scratching each other's
fleas all the time.  Let there be some people who develop global
critical vocabularies about poetry (just go read the Princeton Encyc.
for a couple months: that will do the trick), and set them loose on the
chapbooks out there.  Let there be advocates of a Hart Crane Tradition
(read his letters on reading poetry: it will clean out your system).
Let there be an Indie Critical Union that is Cool.  Steve Evans is dressed
for the part; Rod Smith & his collection have just the right mix of
youth & miseducation; they just need to get together with a dose of
fuck you cold shower do-it-yourself street-level ammonia vinegar ice
in the veins honesty. The stage is set!  They don't criticize themselves -
let the Critics appear!

All of a sudden the academy will not be a rest home for aging Langpo
heroes or 70s prof youth hostels; they will have to play catch-up with
a poetry world that measures itself honestly
by standards not established by the poets themselves.

Finally, in response to those troubled by economic conditions & the "cop-out"
tag I put on Rod Smith.  You say Rod was just characterizing a situation.
But he was also promoting a list of his fave raves.  I said: I agree.
There's no need for critical boilerplate P.R. ala the Language Poets.
I agree.  Just don't wimp out by saying "hey, we're really poor in our
dead-end jobs we can't think critically we just write the stuff." That
is a cop out.  Rod didn't say exactly that.  He sort of left it open;
it's: there's these economic conditions so we either CAN'T or DON'T FEEL
LIKE developing a critical armature.  (Economic conditions are probably
no worse now than they were in the 70s for those concerned.)  I say:
Rod, whether you do it yourselves or somebody else does it, it would be
good for poetry right now to have a non-tenured non-promotional non-blurb
non-publisher non-establishment non-group non-ideological non-clubby
non-bullshit pro-poetry INDY CRITICAL ARMATURE.  Yay Edgar.
- Henry Gould

p.s. Don's poetryometer, for example, seems to be working PERFECTLY and
I'm going to send it some non-incestuous chapbooks very soon. Eric,
on behalf of Jack, on behalf of Henry, owes you a hamburger.

Hi everyone.

Here's the info again on the PhillyTalks newsletter if interested. Unlike
the lovely Kevin K, I unfortunately must ask you for $2 per issue, but I
will be happy to send them to as many as desire them.

Thanks to Nate Chinen, the newsletter will also be available on website --
#2 is just up as of yesterday, just one click away from #1. #3 is on the
way, apparently.

The next two issues will surely be as exciting as the last three have
been. Here's the line-up:

    #4     Feb. 18:    Jena Osman & Tina Darragh

    #5     Mar. 5:     Tom Mandel & Ammiel Alcalay

Back issues:

    #1     Oct. 30 & 31:  Laura Moriarty & David Bromige

    #2     Nov. 5 & 6:    Andy Levy & Jackson Mac Low

And, for #6 I want to announce a CALL FOR RESPONSES to any of #s 1-5.
Respondents so far include Ben Friedlander. Please send me your materials
(and checks or bills) to: 4331 Pine St., #1R, Philadelphia, PA, 19104.
Or query me, if you like, at my email address.

PhillyTalks #s 1 & 2 can be found at: http://dept.english.upenn.edu/~wh

I may as well also plug the upcoming issue of the magazine _Open
Letter_; guest edited by Jeff Derksen, it is titled "Disgust and
Overdetermination." I'm pretty sure a single issue costs $9 and can
be ordered from Frank Davey, 499 Dufferin Ave., London, Ontario, Canada,
N6B 2A1.

Best,
Louis

Henry,

     In the days you are talking about, I was an 'occasional' reader
of poetry without much interest specifically.  But poetry was in the
air then, it was alive and mattered to more than the poetry world.  No
matter what you say about the old poets and old readers, I don't
think that's true today.

Papa was always working on the house,
his long shadow bent across the sill
like a letter in an unknown alphabet,
his hoe or hammer making their steady
marks across the vagabond afternoons,
the deep summer water we lived through
holding our breath, our lungs tight
with promises, danger, laughing gas.

And when we grew older, more serious
and dangerous, Papa was always working
late at the office.  For all we knew
he was a drone of the dread Pharaoh,
one of the caretakers of the Sphinx,
late into the night composing riddles,
subtle passwords and husky undertones
which opened the secret granary doors.

And it was only later, as we watched
his dry wooden boat slip underground,
that we understood the clean framing
of intention, the straight crossbeams
of its execution, that house of his
a kind of sounding board for praise.
Working across the tightrope of the
roofline was his way of walking on air.

     The visual is operative.  It allows the reader/writer to keep
opposites and connections in mind.
     Padin uses the example of the significance of "T" in a poem
that uses patria (homeland)/paria (exile - pariah) with T ->cemetary
cross=death.  This action of stillness - being held in the mind - does
seem to be a uniquely visual action?

Send him my best, please. I blush to reveal my ignorance of what's in The
Nation (and so many many other time-honored venues), but my mind seems to
travel between the worldly and the unworldly with no resting steps between.

Ok, now we are having fun!

"I don't remember any of them (i.e. the SF language poets of Katy Lederer's
reference) being critical of me, just encouraging. Maybe they thought I was
an acolyte? "

...writes Gordon which made me guffaw at my monitor. The idea of Gordon as
*anyone's* acolyte is very very funny.

You couldn't be around someone in those days whose sense of you was as
immediately accurate and deflating (and friendly and brilliantly
intelligent) as Gordon's. I thought she was so great I hired her to work
for me the moment I could afford to. She related to me in that context as
any other with an uncanny combination of fellow-feeling and sardonic
pin-wriggling-to-wall.

Reading Gordon's post and Kevin's post about who was in SF
in those days and where in life or death they are now
makes me want to mention Dan Davidson, another poet
who surfaced in the mid-eighties and was
warmly welcomed by his older soon-to-be-friends.
I miss Dan, and I wish he were here so I could throttle him for what he did.

 Tom -- Levi is well & alive in the Mid-Hudson Valley (or in Kent's terms he
 joined the Catskill school) & writing much excellent art criticism, some of
it
 in easily accessible places like The Nation. >>

Last time I saw Levi, he was still working on _Odile & Odette_.

ps. to David Israel: It's Arthur Sze. & yes, _Archipelago_ is a wonderful
piece of writing.

pps. it strikes me that there are many many "experimental" writers in the bay
between the ages of 35 & 45 -- quite a few of them on this list. maybe not
making as much noise as some, but the work's available for the reading. these
lists of names, though, kinda become little more than chicken feed scattered
in the dust.

katy
weez down here in the midwest shur are grateful for 't all the talkin

but just to ask which generation is it that one belongs to ifn this is the
case - ie, what if this seemingly necessary definition-by-generation is
not so necessary seeming? in this belly of the beast even, arent there
first years, second years, undergrads, not-in-the-workshoppers, undergrads
in workshops, ... - just to say that maybe a 'critical' take understood
via singular constructions such as generational, or gender, arent so
useful finally- and like you say, how bout looking at the 'work' (as
opposed to the 'play'??)- in this respect,
i'm interested in the link you imply in work such as nick regiacorte's and
that of say, josh may - both of whom have writing around, maybe not in the
'successes' form of a book contract or even a single publication, but
beyond this, what gives? - in the end, what is the motivation to say 'this
work belongs in this camp, this one belongs over here'? reviews aside,
which do seem to function purely as PR (have never personally read a
scathing review of any book, poetry), 'critical' work, as you have said
before, can certainly be that kindo f thing taht tells you as much about
how a reader reads as a writer writes - well that these are more closely
related in process (read: simultaneous) than the terminological
distinction between 'reader' and 'writer' ('critic' and 'writer') makes
them out to be

Thanks, Kevin K., Chris S., Laura M. and others for terrific posts.  In
the early seventies I dropped out of a very active Berkeley reading and
publishing scene in which I had been increasingly "successful."  It
seemed to me that in my milieu (with the important exceptions of Judy
Grahn and Kathleen Fraser) people were repeating themselves, and I was
irritated by the easy applause I was getting.  I left the scene cold,
continued to write, and didn't send work out for fifteen years (was
probably also terrified by recognition, but that's another story).  Soon
after this departure, I ran into one of the avatars of Berkeley poetry
of the time, a woman who has since gone on to become very famous for
work I don't respect.  As we picked up our daughters at daycare she
asked me "So, have you RETIRED?"  The edge of sarcasm was evident.

But no--I hadn't retired.  I didn't have words for what I HAD done, but
it's clear now that turning my back was essential.  At the time, all I
could do was strap my daughter into her car seat and drive away.

It's said that we're a nation of salesmen, and sometimes, even in the
odd precincts of poetry, it's just not okay to stop selling.

My Mythology


The earth was formed from a swelling that began out of a primordial
germ and split, separating dust from effluvia, debris from stony
veins. From this, the kami emerged. Soon veins formed head-bands,
emptied of swollen lungs and brains. Some kami committed seppuku,
removing their tongues by means of pinchers forged from stony veins.
Thus were formed brains with their many channels of mizu. Ah, lovely
mizu! Transparent mizu! Tasteless mizu! Channels of mizu run down tiny
brain-cunts in skulls formed from stony veins. Thus were formed "chan-
nels." Inkan stamp the elbows of kami-heads; the stamps cry "Oh Holy
Mother Let Us Have Necks And Shoulders." Thus did necks and shoulders
form. Some kami have arms on shouldes on necks on heads. They are
meat-girls, Nikukos swelling into split germs and stony veins. They
are angry girls! They are Buffalo Daughter, whose New Rock release is
on Toshiba-EMI Limited, a blend of techno and industrial voice-over
somewhat reminiscent of Big Stick, first heard at Rhino Records in Los
Angeles (as usual, their lead singer died). Buffalo Daughter appears
courtesy of Chameleon Records in Fukuoka, punk-animals everywhere or
rather can you dance as the voice goes _way behind_ the back-beat.
Meanwhile, in the Nihongi, Izanagi no Mikoto and Izanami no Mikoto say
"Why should we not produce someone who shall be lord of the universe?"
- an off-handed remark leading to much future woe. One can only imag-
ine. "Universe" is given as "tenka" in a footnote, now meaning "the
whole country; the public; the reins of government." Either a bring-
down (EFL students wa take-note of the idiom) or hubris, from The New
Crown Japanese-English Dictionary. What happens in the tenka? I don't
know, but return to Nikuko's story, for her promising anger which
spread like a virus from Nikukos-coalescing with trunks and legs,
breasts and wombs, fierce warriors who have heard of Greece and Mon-
ique Wittig. They come across a hermit in a cave, another kami in
disguise, since there are Nikukos-One and kami, and that's all. They
show him their cunts, ask for sake; they drink much, push the stick
through his cloth, and that is all there is to it. Shite, lead char-
acter in a Noh play, he begins to sing, Wa! (Harmony!) Waa! (Hurray!)
He's _it,_ goaded by the _waki,_ Nikuko-who-does-not-wear-a-mask. Wa!
Waa! Yugen, mystery-depth-profound-subtle-aesthetic, emerges among the
kami, a beat magazine in New York 1950s, edited by Leroi Jones, if
memory serves me. "It runs fine when I'm here," sing Buffalo Daughter,
thinking of Nikuko. Shite-hermit sings and sings, stick poking
through. Thus was born "song," "Noh," and "penis." In revenge, Shite-
hermit says, "Nikuko, you cannot be in Noh." No-Noh-Nikuko. She sews
him back up in the cave. (Was he sewn at first? Whose cave? Was that
Nikuko's? Nikuko's cave - thus was born possession. Buffalo Daughter
change to swing-beat. The synthesizers wind down. Anyway, they make
the Sun-Goddess, called Oho-hiru-me no muchi, although Ama-terasu no
Oho kami and Ama-terasu-oho-hiru-me no Mikoto are cited as well. Ni-
kuko takes pity; the earth is kami, too. So are Buffalo Daughter, who
are auspicious; the hermit, who receives the penis; the waki, helping
everyone. Now everyone has all limbs and bodies but the penises and
wombs are equally divided. When a war comes, Nikuko-who-does-not-wear-
a-mask, and is a dark-haired girl living near Nakasu, gets angry, and
says, there is no kami for any of us, and there are many less penises
perhaps at first, and then less wombs. When the earth swells, there is
an earthquake and caves are swallowed in the earth. Sesshu's Long
Landscape Scroll portrays this incident of Nikuko and hermit, and, as
if in despair and irony, there is earthquake also, destroying the
earth shrine at Hakata, until its memory faded from the affairs of men
and women. (Some men and women are born without arms or legs; some
without brains; some without breasts or wombs; some without penises;
some without heads; some without skulls or necks; and some without
shoulders.)

months ago on the Lower East Side. Big Stick has disbanded. The
Sun-Goddess names are from Aston's translation of the Nihongi. Monique
Wittig wrote The Lesbian Body among other works. Nakasu is the
snack-bar district of Fukuoka. Noh is a form of Japanese medieval
theater; there are translations by Waley, but the intensity of tele-
vised Noh was completely unexpected. I live in Hakata-Ku, Hakata Ward,
which is the merchant's town of Fukuoka. I have no brain or skull.
Aston translates the Sun-Goddess' names as "Great-noon-female-of-pos-
sessor"; "Heaven-illumine-of-great-deity"; and "Heaven-illumine-great-
noon-female-of-augustness"; but then Aston was writing in the nine-
teenth century.

This is totally wonderful, reminds me of the Rig Veda, that X 129 that has
driven a _lot_ of work from womb to room. Meanwhile someone could make a
lot of money putting out a popular translation of Japan's Kojiki - at
least I haven't seen one...

It's funny--

My father always told me that "the best work" in English is often
surprisingly full of one-syllable words--Shakespeare, Dickinson, Whitman,
&&&. I wonder with writing like this (which I like)--what to make of that
opinion--I suppose that "innovative" methodologies in poetry have
basically razed all notions of key poetic strategies--razed,
theoretically, the notion of "great works"--

It's interesting though--it seems to me like this is something that really
marks a departure--a schism--epistemological break--whatever--it that's
what we're looking for (gosh, O! Yes, Will Alexander--that's another
example)--any opinions?

Yours,
Katy

Subject:      Indie Critics

I have just one brief summing-up to make, having hogged the list enough.
Will be quiet for a while, & I hope Kent will not be sad & will come back
soon, he's a fresh breeze from Rio amongst us paper pushers.

This whole hoot n'holler about an independent criticism comes down to one
thing.  99% of what passes for criticism of contemporary poetry is either
tendentious ("I'm writing about her because she's good & I like her stuff")
or so necessarily wrapped in academic-scholarly apparatus ("Joe Poet fits into
this dissertation-scheme of development from Obscure Russ-Formo-Femmo-
Performo Bravado in such-such a way...") as to be completely BOUGHT OUT.
Steve Evans, bless his brilliant soul, is a good example: look at his ILS
essay on the process of literary change.  How erudite, how stylized -
& how the poets are bumped in at the beginning & end almost as a footnote.
It's an example of how TALKING ABOUT IT is a major form today, and exhibits
all the incestuous poeto-academo atmosphere I've been railing against.

Now all you street-talkin' anti-intellectuals, don't get the idea I'm on
your side. I LIKE Steve's writing.  It's just not the criticism (that
essay anyway) that Rod Smith et al's "generation" might need.

Poets themselves are tendentious of necessity. That's a given.  Look at
Eliot, the greatest circus tightrope-walker of them all (he did it in his
sleep, like a possum).  He had to create a total mask of objectivity in order
to be the "critic" he wanted - it even invaded his theory of poetry
(objective correlative).  Scholars - grad students, profs - are not
necessarily tendentious - but they are pedantic.  By this I mean the
marvelous researches they undertake tend to enfold the poetry in a total
system of research.  THIS IS GREAT & NECESSARY.  But it's not indi-crit!

Indi-crit is written by philologists in Mandlestam's sense (sorry) -
familial lovers of the word.  But I didn't get this from Mandelstam, I'm
just using him as an illustration.  I am speaking as a poet who has played
by what I consider the rules for over 30 years.  My rules are: do the
poem.  Send it to magazines & contests.  Think about what you are doing -
maybe write an essay about it.  That's it.  In my experience "doing
the poem" has absorbed the energy.  Maybe I am a fanatic, or a hedgehog
in Isaiah Berlin's sense, or a totally introverted recluse.  Fine.
I grant the limitations of my witness to you all out there in poetry-land.
This great List, thank you Loss & Joel & Charles, allows voices like mine
to be heard.  Maybe some of you in the big-city clubs, west coast, east
coast, coast on toast, should pay attention to what I is a sayin.
If any of you are poets - & I have my doubts - I would think you'd
be looking for an indi critic too - somebody with taste, judgement,
freedom, and an artistic instinct. The rest is baloney.  It's the kind
of baloney Emily Dickinson was concerned about, & that led Uncle Walt
to write reviews of himself under a pseudonym.  Not to mention Edgar
Poe.  That's a complicated murder story in which the autopsy was
suborned.

Sorry, i hit the wrong key.  I meant to say that folks who say things like
this are usually vulnerable to the same insults and insensitivities they throw
around.  I for one can't understand how anyone can get any serious work done
when surrounded by such noises.  On the other hand, ambitious folks have to
block out the kinds of sentiments that you express, and are nearly deaf to
them.  To be famous --even at the level of the choir, is a full time job in
itself.  One has to hustle all of the time even to get nominal recognition;
look at the silly argument that centers around the syllabus for Marjorie
Perloff's seminar.  Except at the level of recognition --& we all know what
this means-- this argument is of no importance.  It's difficult even to
discuss the systemic nature of the problem; it's as if the institutional
demands of the academy are suspended.  Publish or perish, however quaint it
sounds, is still an operative force.  I realize that you most likely already
know this, but I emphathize with your sentiments and wanted to respond.

Footnote--I think this is funny, anyway: numerous people, replying to the
thread about experimental poetics done by North Americans of Asian descent
(am I remembering correctly that Roy Kiyooka was Canadian?), have cited
Tan Lin's /Lotion Bullwhip Giraffe/. Everybody, so far, mentions not being
sure of this title, but everybody who has mentioned it so far has given it
correctly. A title with the power to induce widespread cognitive
dissonance is one you gotta love.

I've been busy getting the ListServ happy and moving smoothly, so I'm just
getting back to reading the buffalo list.  Good story.  Since I'm not
originally from Texas, I've never adopted the ten gallon or the belt
buckle.  The boots beat the heck out of dress shoes though.  Anyway, I'll

I read with amazement Kevin Killian's take on the "missing" in SF, and
grew even more emotional with Chris Stroffolino's very accepting note
about dropping out. You see, I hadn't realized, quite, why in the past 4
years I hadn't written much. After watching my brother's closest friends
& lovers & then finally my brother die of AIDS in 1994, it became
increasingly difficult to find productivity important. In fact, it
became increasingly difficult to find ANYTHING important. Certainly not
debates about aesthetics, certainly not literary ambitions; really, they
started to seem obscene in their disregard for the hideous everyday
human loss-of-life ripping through the city.

Lately, poetry seems more inviting--and I'm happy I stayed away long
enough to find it new again, instead of slogging away making poems
without the heart for it.

Anyone looking to see into the heart of the AIDs crisis: find _The
Compassion Protocol_ by Herve Guibert or _Last Watch of the Night_ by
Paul Monette or _This Wild Darkness_ by Harold Brodkey or _Life
Sentences: Writers, Artists & AIDS_ by Thomas Avena.
