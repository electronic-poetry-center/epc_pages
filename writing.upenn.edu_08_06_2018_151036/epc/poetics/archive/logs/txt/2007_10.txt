What about that song "I've Been to Paradise (but I've never been to me)"?  I can't remember the name of the woman who recorded it, but I heard it the other day and was apalled at the ideas it proposed about a woman's "completion."

Tomorrow, Oct. 1, is the official launch day for my new poetry
collection Organ Harvest with Entrance of Clones (Hamilton
Stone Editions). Huzzah!

It is available now at www.amazon.com, www.barnesandnoble.com,
and/or from Hamilton Stone Editions at www.hamiltonstone.org.

Here's a whiff:


What Your Doctor Knows

Knowledge you often hate on first hearing,
coming to love as it grows into you. Perfect
anecdotes, in spite of all your tense
accusations, while, despite the wallflowers
gang-banging the geraniums, a wild kitten
careens in your heart, love by second sight.
The greater the yearning, the greater
the grief. Impractical accident, with a difference.

  but not simpler."

I've Never Been To Me=20
( Charlene )

Hey lady, you lady, cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother and a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do
But, I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk to you.....

Oh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run
I took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me

Please lady, please lady, don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived million lies....

Oh, I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne
on a yacht
I've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman
ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

[spoken]
Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie, a fantasy we create about people and places as we'd like
them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding, it's that man you fought with this
morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love......

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children that might have made
me complete
But I took the sweet life, I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that costs too much to
be free
Hey lady......
I've been to paradise, (I've been to paradise)=20
But I've never been to me

Flying Saucers over Clarksburg, West Virginia

I photographed these flying saucers (there seem to be two types??) over
Clarksburg, West Virginia, in the north-central sector of the state. A
slight amount of detail is visible. Clarksburg is known as the hometown of
Gray Barker, who was first visited by "the men in black" - he was also the
first to write about this top-secret government organization. The saucers
were silent, propelled by a new kind of drives which relies on elements
and physical principles unknown to modern science.

I photographed these wooden and plaster models (there were two types) as
they were thrown vertically in Clarksburg, West Virginia. These were made
by Barker himself and were a prototype for many of the flying saucer ima-
ges from the 1950s-60s. Barker created the concept of "the men in black,"
as well as secret letters purported to originate with the US government,
which encouraged the saucerian movement.

JOHNNY GET ANGRY
(Hal David / Sherman Edwards)
Joanie Sommers - 1962


Johnny, I said we were through
Just to see what you would do
You stood there and hung your head
Made me wish that I were dead

CHORUS
Oh, Johnny get angry, Johnny get mad
Give me the biggest lecture I ever had
I want a brave man, I want a cave man
Johnny, show me that you care, really care for me

Every time you danced with me
You let Freddy cut in constantly
When he'd ask, you'd never speak
Must you always be so meek?

CHORUS

instrumental interlude featuring a kazoo

Every girl wants someone who
She can always look up to
You know I love you, of course
Let me know that you're the boss

CHORUS

Johnny, get angry, Johnny
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny, Johnny

FADE

Anybody who can't here the irony and complexity in "stand by your man"
has no business commenting on popular music.

Though it's probably a good idea to remember that feminism is an ism,
female is a gender.

But oh well. "Soldier Soldier Will You Marry Me" and the hundreds of

Have been trekking along Burmese border, week 2.

Getting some sense of things from local folk in table
conversations, at least bits of this and that, own
personal feelings and overarching concerns that have
been present for years. Naturally, there's this sense
that one is unable to do what might be done, and one
wishes for the best (among all things), and the way
one pulls back to contemplate how love thrown up gives
hope to the dead (or so said the touch-stealer).

--

The monk's tale: 'We cannot turn back'
By Rosalind Russell in Rangoon
Published: 01 October 2007

"We cannot turn back now. Whether it takes a month, a
year or more, we will not stop." With his russet-red
robes pulled around his knees, rocking back and forth
on a low, wooden stool, the senior monk spoke quietly
but determinedly.

Over the past few days, the monk has seen many of his
fellow Buddhists rounded up and carted away as Burma's
military regime brutally cracked down on
anti-government protests, trying to suck any oxygen
away from the flame of revolt. Pools of blood stain
monastery doorways, memories linger of monks as young
as 15 being clobbered over the head with truncheons
and rifle butts.

But in the now-tranquil, tree-filled courtyard in
central Rangoon, it is not of these atrocities that
the monk, in his early sixties and wishing to remain
anonymous, wants to speak. It is the atrocities which
the Burmese people have suffered. The people are
living under rulers busy enriching themselves with
natural gas, timber, diamonds and rubies while
spending less on health care per head than nearly any
other country on earth. They are living in poverty
more akin to sub-Saharan Africa than Asia.

"As monks, we see everything in society. We go
everywhere, to ask for our food and we see how people
live," he says. "We know that they give to us when
they themselves do not have enough to eat, because
there is no work and the costs of living are so high.
We also see how the wealthy live. We see how
everything is getting worse and worse." And that is
why he is adamant that the fight must continue. "We
have already lost too much and the people cannot
continue to suffer as they do," he explained. "We knew
well the risks before we started. It is up to us. We
have to see this through to the end, whatever the end
will be."

Inside the monastery, for now untouched by soldiers, a
group of monks are gathered around a television,
apparently glued to a gymnastics display. But on
closer examination, the soundtrack is not a sporting
commentary about back-flips and balance beam routines;
it is in fact the Democratic Voice of Burma,
broadcasting reports from exiled journalists in Oslo,
Norway. In this way, the monks can monitor the current
backlash against the junta and how the world is – or
is not – responding but can quickly flick the covert
soundtrack off should the military's prying eyes come
calling.

Some of the monks are taking refuge in this temple now
that their own temples have been blanketed in coils of
barbed wire and sealed off from prayer. These precious
religious sites now have the air of military camps.
Gone is the scent of incense burning in worship, now
it is the smell of stale cigarette butts, discarded by
soldiers at the temple entrance.

Tin Shwe Maung (not his real name), a monk in his
early twenties, recalled the moment that soldiers
stormed into the gleaming Shwedagon Pagoda on
Thursday. The government admits to a death toll of
nine that day, but Western diplomats put it much
higher.

"I was sitting with about 30 monks on the ground,
praying at the place of the old brass Buddha. The
police appeared very suddenly. There were definitely
over 100, perhaps as many as 200. Carrying riot
shields, truncheons and bayoneted rifles, they spread
across the compound in front of us, some beating their
shields, others aiming their guns," the young monk
said.

"Without any sort of warning, they charged at us,
firing over our heads with real bullets. Some of us
got up and ran but they caught many monks and beat
them with their truncheons and rifle butts. One monk
they beat very badly, smashing his head. He was only
15 years old, he had just joined the monastery."

Another raid came after midnight, and more monks were
carted off in police vans. "They are not in the normal
prisons but in military and police camps. We hear that
they are barely feeding the monks, nor are they
allowing them contact with the outside," Tin Shwe
continued. "I became a monk because of my love for
peace and my love for Buddha. My heart is so full of
sadness."

Run For Your Life
Lennon/McCartney

Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end'a little girl

how about very popular mainstream songs which do *not* set women back

also, here's bell hooks on gangster rap --

Judging by the 99% male response to the query, can we assume that the women on this list - if there are more than a few left - don't think any song ever "set feminism back"?  Negative publicity being the best form of publicity  - perhaps??

 Tammy Wynette's "Stand By Your Man" was probably the ironic favorite of many of an ex-wife who was busy dumping her beau.

I photographed these flying saucers (there seem to be two types??) over
Clarksburg, West Virginia, in the north-central sector of the state. A
slight amount of detail is visible. Clarksburg is known as the hometown of
Gray Barker, who was first visited by "the men in black" - he was also the
first to write about this top-secret government organization. The saucers
were silent, propelled by a new kind of drives which relies on elements
and physical principles unknown to modern science.

I photographed these wooden and plaster models (there were two types) as
they were thrown vertically in Clarksburg, West Virginia. These were made
by Barker himself and were a prototype for many of the flying saucer ima-
ges from the 1950s-60s. Barker created the concept of "the men in black,"
as well as secret letters purported to originate with the US government,
which encouraged the saucerian movement.

I can't come up with the name of a specific song.  But, when I was forced to hear rap music coming from a radio some drug dealers kept on my steps for twenty years ( I live in the front of a tenement three flights up and thus was forced to hear whatever they played), I remember hearing many lyrics to many songs abusive to women and to gays as well.  To this day, years since my forced hearing of this music stopped, I still can't listen to rap or hip hop music because of my  involuntary exposure to it.  As for specific song titles, I can't say because I pay most attention to classical music, jazz and lately, rock music of the fifties and sixties.Regards, Tom Savage

It's featured in the hybrid documentary, WHAT THE (BLEEP) DO WE KNOW, about quantum physics and self-determination, one's power to shape and reshape reality, hence the universe.  Said polka revs up after an explanation of the body responds to negative stimulus (like thoughts) about being unattractive, fat, etc.  Then everybody gets it on polka-style to an endorphin-rush frenzy.

In the Times yesterday there was an interesting discussion about the prevalence of men in the blogosphere; and since, Stephen, you note the mostly male responses to a question females might also answer, I'll chime in.

It's true that I don't really think songs can "set feminism back" (unless it's the Supreme Court that's singing). There are plenty of songs that remind us how far we still have to go. Since music deals with primitive stuff, and that's what I like about it, I don't need it to actively reflect my politics at all times (I look for that in the political sphere).

Yes, Billie Holiday sang those abject lyrics ("Two or three girls has he/that he likes as well as me/but I love him//I don't know why I should/He isn't true/He beats me, too"); she also talked during some of those same recording sessions about wanting to set off a stink bomb at some motherf'rs house. What poet can't relate to that range?

I love Tammy Wynette's "Stand By Your Man" and I also love her song "I Don't Wanna Play House":

I don't wanna play house
I know it can't be fun
I watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done
I don't wanna play house

James Brown's "It's a Man's World" tells a truth. So does "Think" by Sister Lyn Collins, the Female Preacher. I like the refrain of Rob Base's "It Takes Two".

George Jones's "The Cold Hard Truth" might be a boon for feminism, if feminism benefits from men reckoning with truth.

A friend gave me a Peter Tosh album because she couldn't stand the misogyny of the lyrics. Although I share her politics, she knew that for me the music would trump the lyrics.

I have often thought, since having a child, that many love songs sung by women are actually about the true love women feel for their children--a love that sometimes displaces men. You could make a mix tape for a baby shower with songs like Aretha's "You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman" and so on. Which reminds me of Toni Morrison's remark, "A man is just a man, but a son, now that's somebody."

If a song can set feminism back, can a song set us free? Queen Latifah was a powerful antidote to mysogyny in rap and so is Missy Elliot. But when it comes to setbacks I am still fixated on those Supremes in black robes . . .

"Our D-I-V-O-R-C-E
  becomes final today."

also a Tammy Wynette song --

Years ago I rescued a Bob Marley song for a friend -- When somebody started
playing "No Woman No Cry" she said the song bothered her -- turned out she
thought he was saying that if you don't "have" a woman you won't cry.  (Guess
she hadn't listened to any of the song's verses.) -- I explained something
about Jamaican grammar to her, and she loved the song from then on -- But how
many of us have found ourselves humming a song only to realize with horror what
the lyrics actually say?

Joanne Kyger reads at 4:15 in the Benjamin Mays Center at Bates College
(Lewiston, Maine), on Tuesday 2 October.

Joanne Kyger's Bates visit is one stop on a Maine tour to celebrate the
publication of her Collected Poems (About Now, Orono: NPF, 2007), a major
event in American letters.  Come out for an intimate afternoon with one of
the great poets of our times.

Joanne Kyger=20

2 October 4:15 pm=20
Benjamin Mays Center
(95 Russell Street, the "Silo")

Legendary poet Joanne Kyger makes a rare East Coast appearance.  For
decades, Joanne Kyger has played a crucial role in California's poetry
scene.  Her poetry has been influenced by her studies in Zen Buddhism and
her connection to the poets of Black Mountain, the San Francisco
Renaissance, and the Beat Generation.  Ron Silliman describes Kyger's poetr=
y
as a point of convergence for all "post-avant" literary tendencies the late=
r
half of the 20th Century: "You can hear her influence everywhere, from
Naropa, to the later generations of the New York School, to Language poetry=
.
Get a fix on Joanne Kyger and a half century of American poetry suddenly
comes clearly into focus."  "She is," writes Ben Friedlander, "one of the
finest practioners of the art of poetry conceived (after Whitman and
Williams, among others) as the preservation of experience in language.  The
scale of Kyger=B9s poetry is human existence; spoken language provides its
measure; the animating force is curiosity.  Out of these materials she has
accomplished something magnificent and beautiful.  She has many peers but n=
o
betters."  Kyger's Bates event is part of a Maine tour celebrating the
publication of her collected poems, About Now (798 pages; Orono, ME:
National Poetry Foundation, 2007).  A Q&A will follow the reading.

The reading is free and open to the public.
Sponsored by the Environmental Studies Program at Bates College.

Thanks to all who gave thoughtful responses to my question about
misogynistic or offensive pop lyrics....I posted all the responses I could keep  track of
on my blog....http://joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/....and if I  didn't
ask permission and you don't want it posted just let me know and I'll  delete
ya...on the other hand if I missed ya, please send and I'll put ya  up....I
deleted everyone's email address from their responses of course for  privacy and I
apologize that I did not know the names of some of the  respondents in which
case I usually used initials or whatever was  available....

I found the ambivalence interesting...especially interesting when  people
felt love for a song they knew had indefensible sentiments but was still  great
art....happens all the time... suffering makes for great singing or
sanging......sangfroid rarely gets you anywhere in music...

Also on the Pyjamas, Ronald Johnson's elegy on Lady Di and some thoughts on
Running with Scissors....and the usual appeal for work as JBP is now a
blogazine...feel free to contribute...genre-traitors especially welcome...

amities.

 Tammy Wynette's "Stand By Your Man" was probably the ironic favorite of
many of an ex-wife who was busy dumping her beau.

yes, I remember when I was a wee one listening to Tears on My Pillow by the
Everly Bros. & singing "tempahasafate," & wondering what that meant. Years
later I discovered the line is "tempt the hands of fate." Tears on my pillow
for that one!

My theory of pop song lyrics is that they are aesthetically the best when they are most largely open to interpretation while incorporating enough stock imagery, intertextuality, and at least partially unintelligible.

there's also sorts of obnoxious bullshit in wagner, in TS Eliot, in shakespeare, in picasso but we tend to let it slide where it comes to our aesthetic experience because that's High Culture.

you want to talk objectification of women, take a look at Georgia O'Keefe some time and really think what all those flower-vaginas and skulls and deserts are saying about the female body.

But that's too hard, so instead we go after the low hanging fruit of pop music because pop music is "trash." it's largely made and consumed by the uneducated. it's cheap. its lacking in apparent complexity. and that's precisely the reason that criticism of it from some standpoint of critical theory, no matter whether its marxist, feminist, queer, psychoanalytic, deconstructive, or whatever, is bollocks.

Pop music is not primitive nor is it childish low or untutored. What it is is the vigorous extension of the parellel hybridizing folk traditions of anglo/latin culture. It's often complex, mysterious, moving, and seemingly born ex nihilo from the collective unconscious in its raw character. It's good not because it tells us what we should be, or what we are, but what we wish we were when we aren't thinking about it too hard.

So picking it to pieces and analyzing it in the language of politics and theory and all of that misses the point completely, and in the end says nothing about it.

Can I say that ludicris is a misogynist? yes. He must be to talk about women like that. can i say that Chicken & Beer is misogynistic or that it supports a wider cultural misogyny? no, such statements are meaningless because they have no criteria against which we can test the accuracy of their application. You talk like that about crunk and you have no ground to stand on.

Chicken & Beer is a good record though. no matter what kind of idiot its maker was.

Has anybody mentioned the Pretenders (Chrissy Hynde) song, with the lyrics,

         He hit me with his belt,
         but his tears were all I felt.

         When I heard my baby cry,
         I knew that he loved me.

or also in that song, how do you take lyrics like

         When you try and cut me down
         and push me back
         if I attack your attitude
         I rise up to the challenge 'cause
         I like to taste the sugar of your violent mood

It's tough to know what to think about songs that=20
feel so real, yet so horrible. I mean, I'm not=20
sure we should read all songs as making a=20
statement, feminist or anti-feminist, rather=20
perhaps telling stories, some of which are true,=20
or the emotional content of which could be true.=20
I certainly wouldn't want to censor such songs,=20
yet they can be nearly impossible to listen to.

Subject:      Louise Gluck is the Ann Coulter of poetry,
              or Ann Coulter is the Louise Gluck of politics
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

 Both of these women have annoyed me for many years, but watching the news
this morning, and seeing Coulter interviewed (I seem to like to torture
myself by listening to this woman who claims vegetarians should be force-fed
meat, etc., etc.,) the similarity between the two suddenly came a little
clearer.

Ann Coulter likes to wag a very large cleaver at women who would dare
suggest that they own their own bodies and have a right to an abortion.  She
also likes to say she's a staunch Christian who upholds the high moral
standards which created this great nation, etc., etc., blah blah bliddy blah
blah blah.  She'll go on a dark rampage for as much time as a reporter will
allow her about women who think they're better than the great gray men who
wrote the bible.

Yet Coulter, even this morning at 7 a.m., dresses like a bucket of sex!  She
would give the hottest Biblical prostitute a run for her hard earned cash.
I'm not knocking it!  She looks good!  Some would say she looks great!  This
morning she was wearing the type of mini skirt I recall hearing as a kid my
mother explain to her slutty and marvelous girlfriends that the hem needs to
be closer to the pussy than the knee to be considered a bona fide mini
skirt, which my mother always wore.  Coulter's skirt was mini and there's no
denying it.  And boots right out of an S&M porno.  She's spicy, she's a
freaky mountain of peach and she LIKES it like that!

And frankly, hey, that's cool!  Go for it Ann!  However, needless to say,
the costume contradicts the message of the foremothers she claims to have so
much in common with.

(Gay Republicans (which there are more of than ever before!) LOVE her like
no one else.  But then again, of course they do, these knuckleheads are
living the same kind of contradictory existence that she is!)

The VERY FACT that she is a woman who fearlessly lives her life in her body
at 7 in the fricken morning on national television exactly how she wants to
is awesome, but it's also entirely owed to the very trouble-making women who
have challenged the very powers she claims to walk behind.  She's an idiot
in the end.  Just like Dr. Laura tells mothers to stay at home and take care
of their children, yet is on the air to do so, leaving her own children at
home with a baby-sitter.

For many of the same reasons Louise Gluck has always irritated me.  She's
NOT a poet whose work I have found particularly interesting, but I have had
friends who think she's a genius.  I even got talked into hearing her read
in New York where she trashed Ginsberg, saying he'll be a mere footnote to
the history of poetry in a hundred years.

Getting a glimpse of Gluck in action made me very interested in her.  At the
time (this is some years ago) she had a poem called MOCK ORANGE which had
the flavor of admitting she hates sex.

Gluck likes to use the word asshole, and appropriates other language which
she feels is edgy, and cool, but does it so she can tell you how dirty you
are for liking your asshole.  She is in effect turning the clock back and
making women in particular feel good about feeling that modesty is a form of
courage, and that those who have given themselves permission to like their
bodies in their entirety are dirty filthy scum.

No wonder Gluck hates Ginsberg so much.  No wonder she thinks Mark Strand is
Jesus Christ.  Oh my god, I live for the day when I meet her and tell her
how I've been watching what she does, and how I believe she's not worthy of
the language she uses to abhor the body.

Using the language of Ginsberg to be cool, then turning a gun on him on
stage to say he's going to vanish if she has anything to do with it.

She needs to lighten up of course.  She needs to have Mark Strand recite
Ginsberg's PLEASE MASTER poem while she beats him and reaches for the
strap-on.

My mother and her slutty friends were actually pretty fucking cool in a lot
of ways.  They learned the value of their own judgments, they learned the
taste of their own appetites, they lived and lived and LIVED passionate,
full young lives.  There are a LOT of women from my mother's generation I
meet who have lifted themselves, mind, body, and all of it, over the heads
of the oppressive ideals of the nagging, crabby old men who fear ever second
of their lives for the world they were promised was their own to have, and
to have alone.

The danger of Ann Coulter and Louise Gluck is that they both want to be
empowered by the ass kicking women who made their style, and gave them the
freedom of their language, but at the same time want those women to be
ashamed of themselves, and any other woman who would want to be so bold
today.

It's been years since I've looked at mail in this box every day (or even
every week), so I could easily have missed someone else making either
the macro or micro point I've got here, so I apologize if I'm being
redundant.

But, first, the relationship between any of the popular cultures and the
greater society at large is so complicated in so many ways, both wrong
and right, that to focus so narrowly on a single issue like sexism
becomes a parody of identity politics, not unlike the stereotypic Jewish
grandmother reading about a hugely fatal earthquake in a foreign country
asking how many Jews died. The question isn't exactly wrong, but it
misses so much of what needs to be said that it's kind of, you know, weird.

That said, I really don't see how the Pat Benatar song below can be be
heard as anti-feminist. The relationship described seems entirely
consensual, the narrator posits it as a relation between equals, and as
cited, there are absolutely no gendered pronouns.

I'm not in the academic or political businesses, so I may not understand
the current positions and readings of such texts, but does every
feminist relationship have to be a strictly vanilla heterosexual one
these days? This reading seems kind of, you know, weird.

this poem was found in some old papers in the back of a used book


can a poem reach the other shore?
the photo of wheat grass flashes in the sun
as though hiding from shadow
in the strong wind, the grass bends
but its long feathered tops don't touch
the ground.
identity is like this, it will bend
as flax in smoke
but as a feathered thing
the ground always eludes it.
thank you for your letter.
from this day until my last
i will pray for you.

Herb,

There was an argument/discussion between Mark Wallace and me in The
International Exchange for Poetic Invention blog about two weeks ago around
a poem by Linh Dinh and a poem by Bernadette Meyer.

It all started as responses to my text "On Skin," Mark and I reading these
poems very differently, he talking about the male gaze (that all western
erotic lyric poetry being infected by it and there basically broken,
illegitimate) and me questinging the validity of a concept such as male
gaze. Of course, in the thread here one is talking about this from a reverse
angle, in terms of a female masochism.

Here is the url for the site in case one is interested:
http://poeticinvention.blogspot.com/

Ciao,

Murat

For urgent reading, go to http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/08/071008fa_fact_hersh
 for Sy Hersh's current New Yorker article on Cheney/Bush and Company's apparently intractable intention to make 'surgical strikes' on Iran and Syria.
  These folks apparently want to play the Mideast like an old-fashoned juke box.
  Bing-Bing-Bing.
  The consequences of such madness are beyond their concern or imagination. Unless they are just committed to infinite global mayhem.
  Such attacks - apart from being inevitably (more again) self-destructive of whatever remains of this 'democracy' - will drive gas prices through the ceiling.
  Does one have to wonder much why Chevron just bought back 15 billion dollars worth of its own shares?

  Are there any spines left in this 'roll-over we serve your terror, Mr. Bush,' Congress?

I agree, but years before I was an aging boomer, I thought that Kerouac's writing was touched with great sadness. Kerouac seemed to be a "broken angel."

i've started a collection of texts (with a few newly composed of my
own) that are basic text-only files written for an archiving aspect
and a reader's aspect as well. they are short enough to be read in one
sitting and long enough to engage a thread of ?logic?. ..... i
am posting this to one mailing group with success and am offering it
to the poetics list....

the site's address is: <http://pganickz.livejournal.com> and it is a
'public' site. ....

this site will be active for the months of october and november 2007
and texts can be sent to pganickz@gmail.com starting now. ....

DO NOT SEND TO THE 'REPLY' ADDRESS. but rather to the gmail.com
address. comcast is for pganick's group-membershuos and pganickz
is for correspondence.

the site will be moderated by peter ganick. send 'text-only' files for
consideration. not too short not too long is a good length, i say this
realizing it's a vague proscription. NO 'TEXT-ONLY WITH LINE BREAKS'
files will be considered. .... please ask for clarification for
submission guidelines before submitting if you are uncertain. ....

the guidelines will evolve as the site evolves.

i hope to hear from you soon.

the woman's job to clean up the shit and put her house back in order:   No one
will do it if she doesn't, and she can't live w/ all that stinking  elephant
shit on the carpet.  She applies herself to the task, and soon,  the further she
gets, the more achieved she feels.  Self-esteem  arises in her from this
amazing experience of becoming efficient at cleaning up  the elephant's shit.
Then the elephant walks back in.  What is  feminism?  Women here have been
describing it as an "ism."  Someone  else assumes it is meaningless, but would he
say, meaningless like  Marxism.  I have heard that some think feminism is an
extenuation of  religion.

Men sympathetic to women's causes and plights are sympathetic because they
like women.  It seems increasingly that many women don't like women very  much,
that liking women is too obvious, that one has to pretend one doesn't  notice
us.  There is no out and out acceptance of Feminism as  necessary to
humanism.  Where I live (perhaps outside religion as most  people where I live are),
girls are liabilities -- openly complained of -- and  boys assets.  The futures
for girls & women are limited to their  physical assets, but even beauty is
poor -- the pay is well below the livable  rate for many women I know who work,
resumes & experience go unregarded,  housing costs are obscene, and contrary
to the popular songs about the joy of  and signs of love that come of hitting
us ("if that ain't love, I don't know  what is"), even non-feminists leave
when he acts violently;

by the same token, men have told me that they know only women with high
incomes, and have rarely met the other kind of woman, the mother of daughters,
who goes underpaid, her daughters who go underpaid, thin women who go underpaid,
 regardless of their educations, regardless even of Ivy-league educations,
the  unmarried who go underpaid, the women's sympathizers who go underpaid.

Item: In 1999, my boyfriend abruptly blocked access to my car, when I tried
to leave a restaurant without him -- we were in a disagreement over someone
else's religious recovery, and he turned on me; he hoped there would be life
and  death stakes in this woman's life; she was the Jewish mother of two young
daughters.  I'd already known him to be a salesman who assigned dollar  values
to people's foreheads.  I called the police, who interrogated me at  my car.
A year later, I had lost 20 needed pounds due to stress; the  mother I had
defended from my boyfriend's attitudes had taken to heroin; he had  gained 10
pounds, complained of his spare tire, and awaited the birth of  his male
9-pounder out another woman's oven -- she a  non-college-educated non-feminist, who
was out-earning us, who left  him for violence within a few years.

Anyway, it's this kind of "sex" that many women don't want to run the risk
of going without.

Thin women around here, the lucky ones, make $18 K for a full  year at it.  I
swear, women are being paid by the pound!  It's as if  the collective mind
believes that men will make up the difference in thin  women's paychecks, as if
it's an Us not an ism.

Write a song about that.  Do we poets know how to write songs?   AMB

All the songs with tears in them would make a good list poem.

Here's a link to Pamela Z's song with found text (song titles beginning with "You" from the 1986 Phonolog).

            This is something I have been fasting for over the past week.  =
Please call in!  - Brian
=20


We are at a crucial time for Haiti =E2=80=99s debt cancellation. In Haitian=
 Creole "Sak pas=C3=A9" means, "What's happening." Over the next three days=
 we'd like you to ask your member of Congress: "What's happening with Haiti=
's Debt Cancellation? What's the hold up?"







Since last year, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the Inter-=
American Development Bank have each decided that Haiti =E2=80=99s debts sho=
uld be cancelled. But they are demanding that Haiti wait until the completi=
on of a three-year process =E2=80" at minimum =E2=80" before the debt is ac=
tually written off.=20


In the meantime, Haiti will pay millions more in debt service to these inst=
itutions, when the money could be used for health and education funding, in=
frastructure and many other immediate needs.=20
 =20
In March of this year, seven members of Congress introduced HRes 241, a res=
olution calling for Haiti =E2=80=99s debt to be cancelled immediately. This=
 resolution now has 63 co-sponsors. Take action and help make a final push =
to get the resolution to a vote during a week of intense grassroots pressur=
e.


-------
October 2-4 National Call-In Day in Support of House Resolution 241. If you=
=E2=80=99re in the DC area, walk the halls and meet with Members of Congres=
s to encourage support for debt cancellation.=20


October 4 Haiti Can=E2=80=99t Wait for Debt Cancellation Congressional Brie=
fing on HR 241 3:30pm -5:00pm Room 2105 Rayburn House Office Building . The=
 panel is cosponsored by Jubilee USA, TransAfrica Forum, Partners in Health=
, Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti , and the Quixote Center .=20
-------






CALL-IN DAYS=20

On October 2, 3 or 4 make a call to your representative asking your congres=
sperson to co-sponsor H Res 241. If you can be in the Washington , D.C. are=
 during this week join us in making visits to members of Congress=E2=80=99 =
office. For more information about visiting your representative, please ema=

I just read Charles Simic's incredible hatchet job on Bob Creeley's
career. Check out the latest New York Review of Books. NYRB only
publishes letters to the editor from those famous in its world, which
I think lets out all of us on this list. Which leaves me not a lot to
do with the rage burning in me. Let no one think that the other side
merely ignores us out of carelessness. This is true venom.

Necrovilification is so lame. What was the gravamen, for those of us who
don't have the time to hunt this down? Is it worse than that bio that came out a
few years ago that was so brutal (by Ekbert Faas)? That was still an
interesting book for the insights on Creeley's art, I feel. He lampooned  himself in
his poetry often enough, both his excesses and failings.  His writing holds an
enormous empathy...which is, to my mind, not something  really common in
poetry, contrary to popular belief. Poetry survives;  pettiness doesn't. You can
divine a Hand in that....or perhaps a universe that  is really just bored by
shit talking.

In Performance, Garland Jeffries always did a great job
 on this. Somehow it was hard to hear it without simultaneously
 laughing, the pathos was so overboard,
but the beat was terrific.

Imaginary Syllabi:=20

CALL FOR WORK

=20

Imaginary Syllabi, a book-length project of contributions by multiple =
authors, aims to collect writings which investigate, uncover, examine, =
complicate, question, spoof, spark, incite, meditate, mediate, mix, =
sample, nettle, navigate, question, provoke, and otherwise (essentially) =
challenge pedagogical strategies pursuant to the work of teaching =
writing and other disciplines. Or, writings which dream up, concoct and =
explore fabulist fantasy syllabi for potential imagined or real =
classroom endeavors: Educational projects undertaken and employed =
(deployed) in and outside of official as well as mongrel "schools." =
Official spaces might harbor (or cultivate) the mongrel & vice versa.

=20

MATERIAL:

--Sample syllabi which have been implemented or might/could be =
implemented  AND the opposite of this condition: wholly fantastical =
stuff more suited to investigations in outer space and other =
socio-cultural vacuums.

=20

--Syllabi composed entirely of images or text or some combination of =
both. Syllabi may be scattered or comprehensive lists of pertinent, =
esoteric, weird or terribly useful URLs.=20

=20

--Documents from classroom practices which were successful, compelling, =
disturbing etc. and which their authors wish to share, distribute, make =
known.

=20

--Essays/Syllabi which mention other teachers and communities of =
teachers &/or documents, critiques, etc. &/or explore and extend the =
work of other teachers and communities of teachers, theorists, scholars, =
activist, revolutionaries, radicals, & intellectual insurgents.... There =
is no intended fixed, predetermined or official meaning attached in this =
CFW to the word "teacher"; "A thing which shows or points something =
out."; teachers are sometimes not necessarily human organisms.=20

=20

--Writings which disclose, assay, weigh the idea of the "syllabus" =
itself.

=20

--Unimagined documents for unimagined learners among whom we would also =
group teachers / professors / instructors / mentors / advisors / and so =
on.

=20

READING PERIOD:

October 1, 2007-December 31, 2007.

=20

PUBLICATION:

--Summer 2008. Each contributor will receive 2 copies of the published =
book and additional copies at minimal cost.=20

=20

QUESTIONS?=20

--The intent of this CFW is to spur and develop a sense of critical =
inquiry, partnership, collaboration, critique and rebellion which the =
final book object also aims to cultivate among and within its readers.=20

=20

Points to Consider:

Imaginary Syllabi is primarily (though not exclusively) concerned with =
work undertaken by students and teachers who are working as writers in =
some capacity: as documentarians, compositionists, art critics, =
journalists, performance artists, poets and others.=20

Don't see anything like this in the online tables of content for the current issue (Oct 11), or in the last one (Sept 27); the only thing by Simic listed  is a poem in the Sept. issue. Which issue is this in?

Hey listserv peops ---

I've waxed by blog @ denacht.blogspot.com, where I am collating various
"interesting" poetica from your hubs (blogs, etc.) & EDITING them for entry
into my own hub (said).

I think that with the amount of traffic I'm getting from MIT & Caltech, you
might be heard by folks who "matter."

Oh yeah, Listenlight still kicks ass, still at listenlight.net.  Send your
best. In a couple years, I hope to deliver there a 1st full-fledged "Web 2.0"
poetry portal.

Cheers --

Your happy editor ---

Jess Crockett

Thanks Kevin, and thanks Ruth.  I'm already filling my October calendar with
readings, lectures, and events.  And pumpkin carving, of course.  We don't
have Autumn in San Francisco...at least not like we have it here in New
England.

It's official, CA Conrad rocks.  He's the best reason to read this list.  Another commonality between Coulter and Gluck: the poetics of anorexia.  If you starve yourself enough, it's like killing.  So starve away, convert the fatty infidels to our self-hatred, and may all joy be in the footnotes of history, where someone will discover again what it's like to feel animal delight.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

If you don't want to read BEHIND THE LINES: WAR RESISTANCE POETRY ON THE AMERICAN HOMEFRONT SINCE 1941, watch THE GOOD WAR AND THOSE WHO REFUSED TO FIGHT IT, and you'll at least catch up on "a footnote to a footnote" of that war.

Conscientious Objectors have played a vital role in the progressive movements of this country, including in the Civil Rights struggle, the Anti-Nuclear and Anti-Vietnam War movements, the struggle for better care of the mentally ill, etc.

<blockquote>PBS re-broadcasts THE GOOD WAR AND THOSE WHO REFUSED TO FIGHT IT
shown locally on WVIZ channel 25 Thursday Evening @ 10 pm Beginning on October 4 at 10 p.m., PBS again nationally broadcasts the award-winning documentary on the conscientious objectors of WWII.

THE GOOD WAR AND THOSE WHO REFUSED TO FIGHT IT is the story of 40,000Americans who refused to shoulder weapons in 'the good war' becauseconscience wouldn't allow them to kill another human being. In theface of criticism and scorn, these CO's challenged the limits ofdemocracy and applied their non-violence to pioneer social movementsthat transformed America in the years to follow.

This untold story of 'The War' by Judith Ehrlich and Rick Tejada-Flores won both major US history awards in 2003. The programis now available on DVD for the home market with two hours ofadditional material including:* James Farmer on the pacifist roots of the civil rights movement* The poetry of William Stafford* Studs Terkel on 'The Good War'* Daniel Ellsberg on Thoreau AND the DVD release includes a brand-new Conscientious Objector's DVD with:* Draft Counseling 101* A dynamic workshop featuring current military conscientious objectors* Interviews with five Iraq War CO's.</blockquote>

I haven't found it either. Simic's NYT review on Richard Wilbur was excellent. He was able to distinguish Wilbur's achievement as a craftsman, but see through to the too often timid nature of Wilbur's work, his entire body of work, his canon. I'm curious too see if he scrutinizes Creeley in a similiar manner.

I looked for this article on Creeley at the New York Review of Books website and couldn't find it via their email address.  Does anybody know where it is?  I would like to read it.  Robert Creeley was a great poet.  Charles Simic is a fine poet, whatever his take on Creeley might be.  This should be remembered, although, of course, the issue at hand is whether or not his article on Creeley is any good, or right, etc.  But without access to the actual article, I can't say or see anything.  Regards, Tom Savage

Chris,

I agree that the entire issue wasn't weighed, and I was annoyed at the bent
that the personalities on the radio station placed.  They did not say that
men were more or less happy than they were then, just that they are happier
THAN WOMEN, and wondered aloud if this change had to do with "equality" (a
still debatable issue) and women's lib.  I couldn't help but think that I
certainly wouldn't be "happy" if I were living in a world that's like what
it was before women's lib movements....  I happen to like being able to make
choices about what happens to my body, and I've been enjoying my pursuit of
a higher education, just to name a couple of my personal favorite
"liberties."  I'm not sure I'd be as happy with other alternatives, if those
were the only options.  Then again, I'm not one to enjoy boxes and tend to
try to leap out of one as soon as someone tries to place me in it.

Also, there is research out there that says that single "people" are happier
than married "people," etc.  I think that research can easily show what a
researcher wants to show, and I can't say that the radio show hosts were
even representing what the researchers had intended.  Who's to say?  I just
don't like questions like that when they put a germ in people's minds that
"things were better as they were before-- when women were in their place."
I know that that can easily be my sole take on the experience.  Maybe no one
else heard it the way I did.  But, that's the message I got.

It seems to me that life, on the whole, is more stressful, no matter what
gender or even ethnic background one identifies with, so some statements are
difficult for me to hear.  I had wanted to call into the radio to give my
impressions of all that, but I didn't know that I had time for my rant (as I
was headed into work).

This does not even mention the kind of impact these kinds of statements have
on others in this society who are still fighting for a voice.  Women have
more of a voice than most.

Cheers,
Tracey

Dear Friends,

MIT Press and Printed Matter are delighted to invite you to celebrate
the publication of

* WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT: LANGUAGE IN 1960S ART * By Liz Kotz *


Saturday, October 27, 5-7 pm

Printed Matter
195  Tenth Avenue
New York NY 1011


MIT Press catalogue:
http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&tid=11299


Language has been a primary element in visual art since the 1960s--
whether in the form of printed texts, painted signs, words on the
wall, or recorded speech. In WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT, Liz Kotz traces
this practice to its beginnings, examining works of visual art,
poetry, and experimental music created in and around New York City
from 1958 to 1968. In many of these works, language has been reduced
to an object nearly emptied of meaning. Robert Smithson described a
1967 exhibition at the Dwan Gallery as consisting of "Language to be
Looked at and/or Things to be Read." Kotz considers the paradox of
artists living in a time of social upheaval who used words but chose
not to make statements with them.

Kotz traces the proliferation of text in 1960s art to the use of
words in musical notation and short performance scores. She makes two
works the "bookends" of her study: the "text score" for John Cage's
legendary 1952 work 4'33"--written instructions directing a performer
to remain silent during three arbitrarily determined time brackets--
and Andy Warhol's notorious a: a novel--twenty-four hours of endless
talk, taped and transcribed--published by Grove Press in 1968.
Examining works by artists and poets including Vito Acconci, Carl
Andre, George Brecht, Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, Jackson Mac
Low, and Lawrence Weiner, Kotz argues that the turn to language in
1960s art was a reaction to the development of new recording and
transmission media: words took on a new materiality and urgency in
the face of magnetic sound, videotape, and other emerging electronic
technologies. WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT is generously illustrated, with
images of many important and influential but little-known works.

Endorsements

"In 1959, Brion Gysin famously claimed that poetry was fifty years
behind painting. Gysin's prophecy still holds true: half a century
later, contemporary poetry is just beginning to explore ideas forged
by language-based artists in the 1960s. As such, this book is a
roadmap, bursting at the seams with inspiration and ideas for current
literary practices. By embracing an intermedia approach--one where
music, photography, visual art, poetry and performance all live in
the same room--Liz Kotz elegantly creates a compelling portrait of
our digitized networked present. The implications are radical: by
gazing backwards, this book predicts the future."
--Kenneth Goldsmith, University of Pennsylvania

"WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT is a landmark account of the central story of
post-war art: the first sustained investigation of the 'linguistic
turn' that has defined the arts since the 1960s. As Kotz details with
unequalled authority and insight, language became a primary media for
artists in many movements--from Pop to Fluxus to Minimalism to
Conceptualism--at the same time that the recognition of its
materiality permitted an unrivaled experimentation in literature. The
American art of the 60s, we learn, put French post-structural theory
into radical practice. Combining theoretical sophistication with
archival discoveries, Kotz' truly interdisciplinary scholarship
allows her to reestablish the dialogue--between experimental music,
avant-garde literature, visual art, performance and photography--that
made the art of the period so exciting and that continues in the most
vital work of our own moment."
--Craig Dworkin, Department of English, University of Utah

"Of the many strengths of WORDS TO BE LOOKED AT, Kotz's synthetic
vision stands out. She has a gift for bringing together previously
isolated works in ways that illuminate both elements of her
comparison. The discussion of John Ashbery and Jackson MacLow offers
us a superb example of this within the domain of poetry, while the
chapter on George Brecht's performance piece and Joseph Kosuth's
photographic installation provides a model for the synthesis of
different arts."
--P. Adams Sitney, Director, Program in Visual Arts, Princeton
University

"Book-ended by Cage's 4'33" and Warhol's a: a novel, by 'silence' and
'glossolalia', Liz Kotz's text tracks a hitherto uncharted trajectory
in what she terms "the turn to language" in vanguard art practices of
the 1960s and 70s. Kotz's nuanced probing of linguistic operations
serving instrumental or instructional ends and/or deployed as
material entities illuminates an impressively wide range of works in
various fields from experimental music and poetry, to the visual
arts. Acutely attentive to that era's displacement of conventional
categories, she constructs a network of cross disciplinary readings
that freshly parses the interrelationships of Fluxus, Conceptual,
performance and post-minimal art works with concurrent disciplines."

has anyone mentioned Escape (the Pina Colada song) by Rupert Holmes?

Once again, it's in the latest hard copy edition, hence not on the
web yet. Worth a trip to the newstand or library (there's other good
things in it that won't make your blood boil).

Simic writes poems to fit between the ads in the New Yorker. Bob
didn't. Simic dismisses all but three or four poems of Bob's
published after For Love (1960), in terms that equally dismisses,
without naming, a great many poets he's content to see ignored, whose
practice defines poetry in a manner different from his own.

In the distant past Simic wrote a short book called "White." This was
before he was lionized as the latest emigre from the Communist East.
Since then he's paid for his supper. He's a skilled poet of his kind,
but the world really doesn't need "fine" poets. Creeley changed lives.

My mother, along with her two sisters and three brothers, got her BA
in the late 30s, despite being the child of workingclass immigrants
who spoke English as a second or third language. This wasn't easy,
but it wasn't unusual or heroic, either, in that time and place, when
the City University of New York was tuition-free (two of her brothers
were educated via the GI Bill). At state schools in the 40s, 50s and
60s, when tuitions were either free or very low, there were also lots
of female students, though they tended to be middle class, in part
because of the expense of living away from home, and undoubtedly
because of social bias. It was working class women who were most
educationally deprived then and are so now, when tuitions even at
state schools have soared. The issue for women with degrees, whether
from public or the more restrictive private institutions, was what to
do with their degrees once they graduated, and that, as well as
social expectations, tended to push them towards degrees in fields
where women could expect to be hired.

It's a triumph of social change, of which feminism may be as much a
result as an agent, that employment opportunities have opened up and
expectations changed. Now the majority of degrees go to womenas well
as new hires in most of the learned professions.

Yup, middle class women certainly do. The issue is the voiceless
working class. Class and caste seem to trump sisterhood (or
brotherhood, for that matter).

i was floating through the internet, & realized that there are the entire
texts of some 60s 70s 80s etc canadian poetry books online? fred wah's
'breathin' my name with a sigh,' bowering's 'points on the grid,' victor
coleman's 'light verse,' etc; extremely cool (although many of you
probably already knew this).

Maybe we're thinking about this all wrong -- it's not the misogynist songs that
set feminism back: those are easily discounted, and laughed at.

Here's the song that REALLY "sets feminism back" -- it's the song that is
paradigmatic of the man who is really really sorry and has been changed by
his True Love for the woman:

Hello Darlin'
nice to see you
its been a long time
you're just as lovely
as you used to be

how's your new love
are you happy
hope your doin fine
just to know it
means so much to me

what's that Darlin'
how am I doin'
guess I'm doing alright
except I cant sleep
and I cry all night 'til dawn

what I'm trying to say
is I love you and I miss you
and Im so sorry that I did you wrong

look up Darlin'
let me kiss you
just for old time sake
let me hold you
in my arms one more time

thank you Darlin'
may God bless you
and may each step you take
bring you closer
to the things you seem to find

goodbye Darlin'
gotta go now
gotta try to find a way
to lose these memories
of a love so warm and true
and if you should ever find it
in your heart to forgive me
come back Darlin'
Ill be waiting for you

Hi all,

As the baseball playoffs begin today I thought I'd share the online pdf of
last fall's Boog City baseball issue with all of you, many of whom haven't
seen it before. (Below this note is a descrip of the issue's contents.)

http://welcometoboogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc37.pdf

Best,
David

-------

Boog City 37 is the press's latest baseball issue. I assembled 25
poets, the number of people on a baseball roster. Each poet was then
assigned a different position on the team and asked to pick anyone who
had ever played their position, be they in Major League Baseball, the
Negro Leagues, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League,
the minor leagues, college, the schoolyard, or anywhere else, and
write a poem about them.

I placed a few calls and visited a few bookstores this afternoon.   It's not
out anywhere.
Seems subscribers got the issue ahead of all the bookstores (indys and

online or in our local store.  Probably end of the week or next.

my wife and I joke about "waiting by the phone for him to call me" songs
(aka, songs of the doormat), of which the sine qua non example is Vicki
Carr's It Must Be Him:=20

It Must Be Him

I tell myself what's done is done
I tell myself don't be a fool
Play the field have a lot of fun
It's easy when you play it cool

I tell myself don't be a chump
Who cares, let him stay away
That's when the phone rings and I jump
And as I grab the phone I pray

Let it please be him, oh dear God
It must be him or I shall die
Or I shall die
Oh hello, hello my dear God
It must be him but it's not him
And then I die
That's when I die

After a while, I'm myself again
I take the pieces off the floor
Put my heart on the shelf again
You'll never hurt me anymore

I'm not a puppet on a string
I'll find somebody else someday
That's when the phone rings, and once again
I start to pray

....

Well, of course "waiting by the phone for him to call" songs are a very different
category from "I'm sorry I done you wrong" songs. Which one would you say
"sets feminism back" within the meaning of the phrase as it's coming clear in
this discussion?

*******************
P-Queue: Call for Work

P-Queue is a SUNY Buffalo-based journal of poetry and poetics, and we are c=
urrently seeking submissions for our 2008 volume. P-Queue is=20
interested in 'hybrid' work=E2=80=94what toggles between poetry & prose, cr=
itical & creative, "academic" & "non-academic," the visual & the written.=
=20

For Vol. 5 (the first in our second series!), we're especially interested i=
n the question of "care."

To this end, we'll be more inclined to consider collaborations, conversatio=
ns, collocations, correspondences, and the like. These are of course loosel=
y=20
and widely interpretable, but what we want is a representation of ways of b=
eing together in language, ways of being in language together.=20

 Consider:=20
 -selections from letters ('literary' or otherwise)
 -conversations (recorded, repeated, replayed, etc.)
 -collaboration: in composition, in editing: work that widens the scene of =
writing, the scene of reading
 -collocation: the prosodic or the rhetorical: work that calls us to it, ca=
lls us together, to space created

And as always, we=E2=80=99re looking to question genre and convention (and =
to question the _questioning_ of genre & convention!).

Our covers are (lovingly, care-fully) letterpressed, the journal often incl=
ude images and 'manipulated' texts, and we pride ourselves on the=20
appearance of the publication. P-Queue is published annually (the 2008 year=
book will appear in Summer 08). To receive full consideration, please try=
=20
to submit work by Jan. 1.

Hi,

  I'm currently collecting exemplars of epistolary form for a course I'm teaching in the spring. I'm looking for examples in fiction and poetry, as well as "real" correspondence (especially by writers of fiction and poetry). I'm also interested in material that approaches the letter form obliquely, such as material that claims to be epistolary but doesn't look like letters, etc. I'm going to do some direct address (e.g. New York School) but not a ton....more looking at things that specifically enact the letter form in some way. I'm interested in full-length works, series, and single pieces. I'm also interested in any writing you know of about epistolary form.

  I'm pasting in the authors I'm already aware of who've done epistles in one or more genres. I'd love to hear whatever springs to mind. Feel free to backchannel if you'd prefer.

PS, BTW, I failed to mention in my list an obvious choice--Dana Teen Lomax and Jennifer Firestone's forthcoming collection Letters to Poets, which features correspondence between "emerging" and "established" poets--a project which revivifies the letter form and brings it to bear on contemporary poetics in exciting ways....

NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER, by Joyelle McSweeney
FIGURES FOR A DARKROOM VOICE, by Noah Eli Gordon & Joshua Marie Wilkinson,
with images by Noah Saterstrom

NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER
by Joyelle McSweeney
Fiction. 5"x7", 132 pages
ISBN: 978-0-9779019-4-4
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/McSweeney/index.html

NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER, McSweeney's first full-length work of fiction, is
a baroque noir. Its eponymous protagonist is a loner who tries to comprehend
everything from the outside, like a sarcophagus, and with analogously ornate
results. The method by which the book was written, and by which Nylund
experiences the world, is thus called sarcography. Sarcography is like
negative capability on steroids; this ultra-susceptibility entangles Nylund
in both a murder plot and a plot regarding his missing sister, Daisy. As the
murder plot places Nylund in increasing physical danger, his sensuous
memories become more present than the present itself.

"If Vladimir Nabokov wanted to seduce Nancy Drew, he'd read her NYLUND one
dark afternoon over teacups of whiskey. Welcome to fiction's new femme
fatale, Joyelle McSweeney." -Kate Bernheimer, editor of Fairy Tale Review
and the author of The Complete Tales of Ketzia Gold and The Complete Tales
of Merry Gold

"If Wallace Stevens had written a novel it might have come close to Joyelle
McSweeney's NYLUND, THE SARCOGRAPHER. But any imagined effort of Mr. Stevens
would pale next to Nylund's journey through the butterflied joinery of
syntax, the jerry-rigged joy of this tour de joist. And you thought you knew
your own language. This book hands it back to you on a platter and includes
the instructional manual for its further use." -Michael Martone, author of
Michael Martone

Joyelle McSweeney is the author of The Red Bird and The Commandrine and
Other Poems, both from Fence. She is a co-founder and co-editor of Action
Books and Action, Yes, a press and web quarterly for international writing
and hybrid forms. She writes regular reviews for Rain Taxi, The Constant
Critic, and other venues and teaches in the MFA Program at Notre Dame. Her
next book will be the science fiction novel Flet, forthcoming from Fence in
late 2007.


FIGURES FOR A DARKROOM VOICE
by Noah Eli Gordon & Joshua Marie Wilkinson
with images by Noah Saterstrom
ISBN: 978-0-9779019-5-1
Poetry. 5.5" x 7", 94 pages
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Figures/index.html

In FIGURES FOR A DARKROOM VOICE the rhetorical twisting of Noah Eli Gordon's
abstractions meld with the ominous narratives of Joshua Marie Wilkinson's
fragments, turning Wallace Steven's notion of a supreme fiction toward a
supreme friction, one where the work of these two poets is fused into a
voice as singular as it is sinister. Imagine a gallery in which Cornell
boxes talk back, a Maya Deren film in which the audience dissolves into
projector light, a Philip Glass composition played exclusively on medieval
weaponry, such are the compelling results of this collaborative work.

In prose poems, syntactically elusive sonnets, and haunting, haiku-like
fragments illuminated by the ink drawings of Noah Saterstrom, one encounters
a recurring cast of logically-skewed images, inauspicious yet arresting
aphorisms, and characters rendered fully bizarre in the lightest of
brushstrokes. Here, the slippage and disruptions of textually investigative
work collides with the mind-expanding project of conjuring paradox, while
never quite leaving linearity behind. When these poets write, "I am trying
to draw you a simple picture of explanation," one realizes the monumental
nature of such a task. And this task is made more complex, and ultimately
more rewarding, by the inclusion of Noah Saterstrom's dynamic images. "Who,"
Gordon and Wilkinson ask, "operates the levers in this darkroom dress-shop?"
Who, indeed! The rich history of literary collaboration just got richer.

These two guys tell us,
"There is nothing that summer can do to us
That we could not ourselves develop in the basement"
so we know
"the sleepwalkers enter a swimming pool
With their haggings& black dresses,"
"raising private horses"
Therefore it's true
"What mammal wouldn't want its own vibrant egg?"
They glitter. This book glitters.

GLORIA:

i'm delighted you pointed this out. last week Frances Kruk, Sophie Robinson, Kai Fierle-Hedrick both visited & read to two wonderfully large audiences. as both are younger you may not be familiar with them. while Frances is rooted in potatoes, Sophie's currently at Royal Holloway. Kai's work appears in Brit po issue of CR. Frances & Sophie connected to Yt Communications.

as for the Poetics Plus calendar, Harriet Mullen was scheduled to read this term but had to cancel. she's planning to visit in spring -- among a number of other women poets.

but thanks for the heads-up. good to be on the lookout.

rich...

There's always Montesquieu's "The Persian Letters", which has to be
one of the earlier examples. The book of Paul is essentially
epistolary though not sure it's a brand of literature you're after.
And, something I noticed again rereading Liebnitz the other day, most
enlightenment and early modern philosophy transpired by letter and
usually begins with a dedication to the receiver, which is the place
where the author's consciousness about the politics of his writing
usually surfaces. Machiavelli and More are particularly obvious
examples (though in the case of More it becomes a dialogue embedded
in a letter). Just open up any good edition of either of those two,
or Descartes or Liebnitz or Hume and you'll usually find someone to
whom the work was explicitly addressed

hope any of that helps,

I always argue with that one though-- it does have one critical bit of lyric
"Instead of me..."  which implies that the speaker felt that he was under
her thumb at one point.  So I just see it as a song about very human power
struggles.

I also agree that Stand by Your Man is rife with irony.  I have no problem
with it.

My vote would be for "American Woman"-- I really HATE that song.  And could
we pick the recent and very obvious "Humps"? Bleh.

maybe relevant to some of the discussion...

Around the time of PJ Harvey's "Sheela-Na-Gig" (which some call a
feminist pop-song, and some call an assimilationalist compromise-),
ah, but it rocks (in more than one sense of that word!), I found this
book by Laura (Riding) Jackson, largely written in the early 1930s
but not published until 1993. Here's a quote from it:

"Woman, because she is an absolute, unindividualistic being, can only
get a sense of her difference from man through man's sense of her as
something different. But for this sense she must go to man's
feelings, not to his reason: to the evidence of her actual impact on
him. Man's reason tells nothing about woman; it is an attempt to
integrate itself, merely, and by suppressing evidence of what
differs....But man's reason is not perception-proof; it is shot
through with involuntary reactions to experience. And it is these
reactions alone which can provide accurate information about woman as
an observable phenomenon, and which we must be careful to separate
from rational statements about woman. And when the rational statement
is made by a woman it is likely to be more false to the nature of
woman than when made by a man: because a woman has no external
experience of herself which might discredit the statement, while a
man cannot but supply, along with the rational statement about woman,
a reaction that contradicts it.  (77, 78...)

earlier she writes men invented feminism (pg. 53)...

Hi Sarah...I didn't read the ones after your post so if i'm being pleonastic i apologize...of course Richardson...you allude to New York School....Berrigan of course comes to mind with his most famous work; then there's that unusual book about weird psychic coincidences, synchronicity,?where the artist/protag ?is seemingly "linked" to someone on the other side of the world who is writing to him...I forget the name of that one..it's lavishly illustrated and the letters are presented in facsimile form, often in little envelopes glued into the book...is Sheila Murphy's Letters book meant to be interpreted literally vis-a-vis those poems? Does Rilke count? Well you did say fiction or poetry....would you consider posthumous letters such as Catullus to his brother? Philip Whalen also has a shiv of a letter (a poem)?written to his dead mother....very moving....it's in the Selected with the great opening essay by Scalapino...

Hi,

  I'm currently collecting exemplars of epistolary form for a course I'm
teaching in the spring. I'm looking for examples in fiction and poetry, as well
as "real" correspondence (especially by writers of fiction and poetry). I'm also
interested in material that approaches the letter form obliquely, such as
material that claims to be epistolary but doesn't look like letters, etc. I'm
going to do some direct address (e.g. New York School) but not a ton....more
looking at things that specifically enact the letter form in some way. I'm
interested in full-length works, series, and single pieces. I'm also interested
in any writing you know of about epistolary form.

  I'm pasting in the authors I'm already aware of who've done epistles in one or
more genres. I'd love to hear whatever springs to mind. Feel free to backchannel
if you'd prefer.

The list seems somewhat random, though mostly very recent. What are
your boundaries? There are thousands of possible texts: it's a very
old form--Eloise and Abelard, for instance, and it was a dominant
form for the novel in England and France in the 18th
century--Richardson, Laclos, Rousseau, etc. Letters themselves, as in
your mention of Dickinson--what about St Paul?

One thing that occurs to me here, though I haven't read it yet, is that a new volume of correspondence between Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov has recently been published.  Are there any epistolary poems in it?  I can't say.  Regards, Tom Savage

Subject:      The Sondheim effect*
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

The Sondheim effect*

Working with film twenty years ago, I discovered that if stereographs
(which are mostly late 19th-early 20th century photographs viewed through
a stereoscope, giving the viewer a three-dimensional image) were rephoto-
graphed on movie film, alternating left and right - upon projection, a
three-dimensional effect was clearly visible, even though both eyes
perceived the left and right viewpoint. In traditional stereoscopy, the
left eye perceives the left-taken image, and the right perceives the
right-taken one. In other words the three-dimensionality is synchronic-
ally, spatially, encoded and the mind reconstitutes the scene. In the
Sondheim effect, the encoding is diachronic; both eyes perceive both
images in quick (16-24 fps) alternation. The result should be 'something'
like a back-and-forth shuddering, which does occur, but it is accompanied
by a three-dimensional illusion which has varying degrees of depth,
depending on the original image - clear foreground/background information
tends towards the greatest illusion.

(It's been pointed out many times that it's possible to create depth by
watching a soccer game, for example, with a slightly dark neutral density
filter over one eye. This creates a small processing lag, so each eye
processes at a different rate, hence is reading slightly different images
from the playing field. Now if the ball moves horizontal- ly, it's seen
simultaneously in two different positions, against a more or less constant
background, and appears, again slightly, to jump out from the screen.)

In three-dimensional unpacking, the mind fills in synchronic or diachronic
digital information - discrete images - to recreate the plenitude of the
real, in a sense 'being there.' Think of this as a gestural operating -
given limited information, filling in the blanks, as if vision were active
(which it is) and gestural, as if vision originated primarily from the
perceiver. (This is clear in vision studies, the work of Marr decades ago,
color vision theory, etc.)

Since the analogic is fundamentally continuous, 'of the real,' it might
also be considered, in this case (and the case of color theory etc.) a
kind of suture or bandaging - what are really, inherently, disparate
images - either from photographs or from perception of physical reality -
are combined into a simulacrum of a continuum of spatial depth. Stereo-
graphs are an example of a production involving simultaneity (space);
alternation is an example involving succession (time). This is of course
far too neat and I'm positive would break down on the cog-psych or neuro-
physiological level. So the Sondheim effect in this regard is nothing more
than a curiosity, the sort of thing one might read in Mind Hacks. On the
other hand, the idea that succession can imply a re-reading or reconsti-
tution of simultaneity has interesting phenomenological implications, as
anyone familiar with Husserl on internal time-consciousness knows. The
following video has the _slightest_ Sondheim effect among the runners; and
even when trying, I've never been able to get the sharpness necessary to
reproduce it in video at all. Now with HD, it should be easy to do and it
would be interesting to see the results of a complete narrative movie
presented in such a manner - would the shuddering finally become invisible
as vision synchronized itself to temporal collapse?

http://www.asondheim.org/roughrace.mp4

* Of course, naming the effect after me quickly gives way to the realiza-
tion that there must be thousands of experimental studies of just such
things; it's more than obvious. Viewing alternations is standard in lang-
uage and motion studies; the only difference here is that the alternating

These images are wonderful.  Thank you for sharing them with us.  Perhaps because I just got an announcement about his art, they remind me somewhat of the work of the artist known as Jess, Robert Duncan's partner for many years.  Regards, Tom Savage

Hi,

  I'm currently collecting exemplars of epistolary form for a course I'm
teaching in the spring. I'm looking for examples in fiction and poetry, =
as
well as "real" correspondence (especially by writers of fiction and =
poetry).
I'm also interested in material that approaches the letter form =
obliquely,
such as material that claims to be epistolary but doesn't look like =
letters,
etc. I'm going to do some direct address (e.g. New York School) but not =
a
ton....more looking at things that specifically enact the letter form in
some way. I'm interested in full-length works, series, and single =
pieces.
I'm also interested in any writing you know of about epistolary form.

Nate Mackey's prose.  I've taught Atet A.D. in several contexts, and
students always seem to get into the epistolary nature of the work --
even though (or maybe because) the letters are addressed to "Angel of
Dust."

In response to Simic story, which I haven't read,
which the poster offered as mere titilation - warning,
perhaps (and where is Mr. Bernstein?):

Got lots to say about RC. In the coming years, there
are letters that will be released. He was many things,
mostly important, I think; and inspite of his
insecurities, frailties, honesty, engagement in the
process of life - despite the animosity so many have
held towards him. And despite that animostity, so many
more love the man and his work. It is honest, his
work, we can say with a deep relaxing breath - and did
lots for many. What follows is an email he wrote this
email really hours before his death.

This man, Bob, was, I think, very much the sort of
human embodiment of the divine - a savage on all fours
moving across our dirty floor, so polluted by the
likes of many (including on this list), attempting to
recoup himself and in that, I think, find and offer
grace. He was the man who often said: No problem
what-so-ever. He was an ambitious man, a good man, a
person many of us KNEW.

Dear Bob:

One finds oneself wondering on whose team one'll sit
once sense
of feeling
grounded by structure one presupposes exists is null
and
existence of ideals
flouted make Paine, Lincoln, and others simply
commercial
property -- or
kitsch. With bewilderment, I think there's simply a
floating
kinda feeling,
here. Will new administration make a difference --
with brutal
damage done?
I know the media is handedly controlled in China, but
as your
articles
reveal, there's lots of dirty stuff making the whole
damn place
polluted and
rank on the home front. You're one of the titans, I
might argue,
to jump on
an old sedan and start hollerin' -- like Ginsburg did,
and who
I've,
regrettably, intolerably, berated on past occasions. I
feel that
it might
not only be kindness and realism that we're to teach,
but
values. I think
that something's disappearing, and I thought it was
there -- and
I don't
want to watch it go, to think its possible.

******Please tell me where I can send your package,
because
it'll take about
two weeks from Beijing -- and I want to make sure it
gets to
you. My
girlfriend and I even managed to enclose some reading
material.*****

As for more good things in China: mornings with old
ladies
dancing about,
with pom-pom-type things, smiley-faced grey-locked
teenage girls
in the park
outside our door; a winter where I saw a migrant
worker lugging
a donkey
cart stop to brush snow of his new and well polished
patent
shoes; a friend
name Wu Jian Li whose hoping to travel abroad and have
opportunity to become
a great painter; my love developing inspite of myself
into
beautiful bloom
of seventh year; the sense of aloneness that leads one
to
cherish one's own
home; an e-mail like this. Lots, alas, are sad and
there's a lot
of
mistrust. Today we visited a temple defaced during the
Cultural
Revolution
-- hundreds of tiny buddahs had lost their heads,
along with a
country its
culture by man called too often George Washington.

Best,
Alex

p.s. Take good care of yourself.

really in vogue)

clarissa (richardson)
evelina (burney)
the history of emily montague (frances brooke)
The Mixquiahuala Letters (ana castillo)

If you are interested in actual epistolary novels, early American
literature is replete with them, especially written by women--"the
women's weepy" in derisive terms, or, sentimental fiction is less
derisive terms.  My favorite is Hannah Webster Foster's _The Coquette_,
but there are numerous other examples.  The Wikipedia entry for
"epistolary novel" lists important early ones from Aphra Beha and and
Samuel Richardson, and interesting late ones from Nabokov and CS
Lewis--it's worth a look.

Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet
i second this one. softened my heart towards poetry in general. not epistle
poems, per se, but epistolary nonetheless.

I love this topic.  Samuel Richardson's Clarissa: Or the History of a  Young
Lady (1748) is a novel in letters; I felt like a smart person (your  students
would, too) when I realized I had read this book at a lecture  at the 2000
MLA.  Vangogh's letters.  I have written & pub'd in  journals at least two short
stories that are something like letters; if you  like, see
_http://annbogle.blogspot.com_ (http://annbogle.blogspot.com) .   AMB

Hi,

  I'm currently collecting exemplars of epistolary form for a course I'm
teaching in the spring. I'm looking for examples in fiction and poetry, as
well as "real" correspondence (especially by writers of fiction and poetry).
I'm also interested in material that approaches the letter form obliquely,
such as material that claims to be epistolary but doesn't look like letters,
etc. I'm going to do some direct address (e.g. New York School) but not a
ton....more looking at things that specifically enact the letter form in
some way. I'm interested in full-length works, series, and single pieces.
I'm also interested in any writing you know of about epistolary form.

  I'm pasting in the authors I'm already aware of who've done epistles in
one or more genres. I'd love to hear whatever springs to mind. Feel free to
backchannel if you'd prefer.

I find disturbing - I suspect as with many - WBAI's 'trembles' and refusal to provide an on-air reading of Howl. On the other hand, I understand totally why the Bush Administration does not want to publicly air its internal memo's that sanction torture up to the 'point of death' - as also revealed today in the NYTimes. Now, those memos are indecent, obscene and probably going to be the cause of the vengeful deaths of many of our fellow country persons.  But "Howl"? I don't think Howl ever killed or tortured anybody!!
 Well, to remember the good old days, you might go over to Jacket and see Gordon Ball's 1991 picture of military cadets  reading Howl as, apparently, a required classrom text. It's ironic and wonderful. But that was back in Iraq I, back in time when Powell and Cheney were steadfast against going into Baghdad - and if Cheney was already excited by some imagine benefits from the practice of torture, we did not hear about it.

Sarah -
Are you familiar with the somonka - a form of Japanese epistolary
love poem?  two tankas, five line poems with syllable counts
5-7-5-7-7. The first tanka is a statement of love. The second, by
another author, is a response.
I can send you one of my own, an exchange that goes on for a while, b/
c if you'd wish.

A good photography gallery asked me if I could help them find a good poem &/or poems that deal with echoes, and or mirrors. (They be doing a book). And the photographer is much into dealing with variously mirrored 'doubles' - usually of the 'funk' flea market sort (cracked ceramic ears, matching stereo speakers, etc.)

 Aphasia here when it comes to remembering texts/poems, appreciate any suggestions.  Wally Stevens might be too mandarin for 'the case.'

 Thanks in advance,

one could do worse than to start with Ovid, on Echo and Narcissus, in
Book III of The Metamorphoses. There are other poems on Echo and
Narcissus you can probably find through google.


Robert Creeley has a poem "Echo" and a book "Echoes," though these
may not be about echo or mirror in the way your photo gallery would like.

I think there must be a sound poem by bpNichol that makes use of echo.

Sylvia Plath's "Mirror" is from the mirror's point of view.


Christina Rossetti has a poem, "Echo."

Echo

Come to me in the silence of the night;
Come in the speaking silence of a dream;
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright
As sunlight on a stream;
Come back in tears,
O memory, hope, love of finished years.

O dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,
Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,
Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;
Where thirsting longing eyes
Watch the slow door
That opening, letting in, lets out no more.

Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live
My very life again though cold in death:
Come back to me in dreams, that I may give
Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:
Speak low, lean low
As long ago, my love, how long ago.



Jonathan Swift has a poem titled "An Echo"

An Echo

Never sleeping, still awake,
Pleasing most when most I speak;
The delight of old and young,
Though I speak without a tongue.
Nought but one thing can confound me,
Many voices joining round me;
Then I fret, and rave, and gabble,
Like the laborers of Babel.
Now I am a dog, or cow,
I can bark, or I can low;
I can bleat, or I can sing,
Like the warblers of the spring.
Let the love-sick bard complain,
And I mourn the cruel pain;
Let the happy swain rejoice,
And I join my helping voice:
Both are welcome, grief or joy,
I with either sport and toy.
Though a lady, I am stout,
Drums and trumpets bring me out:
Then I clash, and roar, and rattle,
Join in all the din of battle.
Jove, with all his loudest thunder,
When I'm vexed can't keep me under,
Yet so tender is my ear,
That the lowest voice I fear;
Much I dread the courtier's fate,
When his merit's out of date,
For I hate a silent breath,
And a whisper is my death.

There must be lots more. Some of these, perhaps all, may be too
mandarin, too. There are probably Mandarin poems about echo, haiku
about looking into water as a mirror, etc.

Hey! Check out Ric Royer's work which I review on my blog, Joe Brainard's
Pyjamas. It's all about the "double."  We were speaking of Creeley...he has  a
book "Echoes" which is of course about the echoes of memory mostly. Notes  for
Echo Lake by Michael Palmer? "He-she bends at the mirrored waist" begins one
poem ("False Portrait.") And he has that strange poem with the Nevercadabra
mirrored box, is it? That's not in this book but in his Selected I'd wager. I'm
 sure you'll got tons of recommendations on this from the list.  Poets tend
to love mirrors and echoes.

There was a genre of echo poems in the 16th century--I remember a good one by Sir Plilip Sidney.

All,

someone has donated money to the CW dept at my University (really a college, but
called a University from old history). we're now establishing a visiting professorship for
a writer, but are looking for a Distinguished or Established writer.

are any of you at a program that has a Distinguished or Established Visiting Writing Professorship? we're looking for models to help us define how to go about creating ours. please backchannel me if your program does have a Distinguished or Established Visiting Writer Professorship. we're looking at all models, including one semester gigs, one-year gigs with low teaching loads, etc.

thanks in advance,

Imaginary pasting of the body; each eye reads the same text, one-two,

Rajaa Alsanea's international hit Girls of Riyadh is made up of mainly emai=
ls, chat room writings, cell phone calls.=20

The novel, written in Arabic, is banned so far in Alsanea's homeland, Saudi=
 Arabia. Since direct interaction between the sexes is forbidden before mar=
riage, the use of indirect means of meeting and communicating between femal=
es and males is widely used.  Hence the large amount of electronic and cell=
 messages back and forth and chat room descriptions shared among friends of=
 the same sex. =20

   Rajaa Alsanea gave a very well attended and received reading--in English=
; she co-translated the book-- at Schwartz's independent bookstore in Milwa=
ukee a couple months ago.  The Muslim men and women in attendance--mostly y=
oung people--sat on opposite sides of the aisle.  The women asked most of t=
he questions after, and the author and her mother stayed much longer with t=
hem after the questions and book signing were completed.  Past the store's =
closing time, actually.  (Questions and answers were in both English and Ar=
abic. Many listeners were taking supplemental English language classes, and=
 a few teachers were also there.)

     There has been a dramatic rise in the writing, publishing and sales of=
 women's work in the last two years from Arab countries where previously it=
 was little published, as well as a great interest in countries outside the=
 Arabic speaking world.  Now a great number of the books are quickly transl=
ated and have been selling very well. =20

     Rajaa Alsanea didn't claim to be a "deep writer"--but the book obvious=
ly meant a lot to the Muslim attendees of both sexes, and is playing a part=
 in the rising appearance of Arab women writers on the world's best seller =
lists. Girls of Riyadh isn't regarded as an anomoly  in its depictions of (=
upper class) Saudi women's lives, but actually very realistic.  It was bann=
ed for presenting a few scenes which have not been described before, not fo=
r presenting things which do not actually happen.  It was pointed out by an=
 audience member that though a book may be officially banned, it still circ=
ulates widely in bootleg copies or foreign translations.  The feeling of a =
number of speakers was that with time and the high profiles and profits of =
women's writing, the bans on certain books  will begin to be lifted.=20

Hi,

  Thanks so much to all the people who've responded to my query with suggestions. You've given me an amazing range of material to explore and jogged my memory about other texts I was familiar with but hadn't been thinking of.

Second part of Oscar winning documentary film maker Errol Morris'
fascinating researches, interviews, & trip to Crimea to investigate
the "truth" behind the first iconic war foto, Fenton's "In the Valley
of the Shadow of Death".  (This part includes, as did the first, some
great examinations of texts also, including one from Tolstoy, who
participated in the war.)
Note:  this Valley is not the "Valley of Death" in Kipling's famous
poem re the "Charge of the Light Brigade," also quoted in the article

Here are some wonderful epistolary or related
things....

Guillaume Apollinaire's Poemes a Lou (all from private
correspondance, as is much of the rest of his work)
Max Jacob's correspondance
The ballad form -- see Christine de Pizan especially,
but also Charles d'Orleans and many others where the
epistolary element is important(the "envoi" is a trace
of epistolary origins, real or fictional)
Clement Marot

There is a great "echo" section (echoes distorting the character's words)
anticipating his death in John Webster's The Duchesse of Malfi.

Aren't echoes integral parts of sound poems?

Mirrors, indirectly echoes, play a central part in Turkish poetry:

Maria

Dear as life
far as China
shut inside an atlas tinted Lisboa
one day you'll leave here
Maria
I search you in mirrors
liar!

smell of cinnamon
on your face
jinn
in your eyes,
liar!
one day you'll leave here
liar!

Subject:      Creeley piece by Simic now out and online...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I checked early this morning and Simic's piece is now on the NYRB's  website=
.
But you have to pay $3 to read it or pay even more for an electronic =20
subscription.
=20
The piece is basically Simic's review of the two latest collected Creeley =20
works (The CP of Robert Creeley, 1945=E2=80=931975 & The CP of Creeley  1975=
=E2=80=932005).  I=20
think it bears reading for Simic's attention to  Creeley's interviews (which=
=20
he quotes from) early on.  It seems to get a  bit thin two thirds of the way=
=20
through.  He heaps a lot of attention on  Creeley's early life with some bio=
=20
information and then a careful look at "For  Love" and then it gets ... thin=
.
=20
Some highlights:
=20
He likes Creeley's early work:
=20
"By broad agreement, For Love is Creeley's best book. There are at  least tw=
o=20
dozen first-rate poems and the rest are almost all of very high  quality.=20
Words (1967), from which the poem about language I just quoted comes,  is an=
=20
uneven book, although it has several powerful poems..."
=20
But loses interest with each succeeding volume of Creeley's  work...  He=20
doesn't consider "Pieces" (1969) very good...
=20
"There are a few good poems in his earlier manner in Pieces, but the  rest o=
f=20
the book doesn't amount to much. Creeley confused ideas about poetry  with=20
poetry itself.  Creeley had ceased to be a lyric poet and become a =20
teacher-preacher type giving us classroom demonstrations of how poetry, writ=
ten  according=20
to a particular theory of poetry, works."
=20
There are some especially slammy lines that follow this section...
=20
"If poetics were like cooking and one could write down a recipe for all of =20
one's future poems, that would be true. However, great cooks rarely bother t=
o =20
consult cookbooks."
=20
"This may sound harsh, but reading the hundreds of poems that Creeley wrote=20=
=20
after Pieces, I could not come to any other conclusion. The second volume, T=
he=20
 Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975=E2=80=932005, which has poems writt=
en just =20
before he died in 2005, is especially hard going."
=20
But then Simic finds something to praise in his last bit of work...
=20
That's it pretty much.
=20
It's in the October 25th issue of the New York Review of Books...
=20

Excellent suggestions!--and don't forget basically the entire works of
Francois Villon--
the ballads and especially those long "letters to,"  those
masterpieces of Gallows Humor the Legacy and The Testament!

besides which all others do but pale . . .

The Bottle In the River by Robert Desnos
deals with reflection in shards of broken glass bottle and the poem has a
sort of an echo itself, a circular feel- I love this poem, and a Surrealist
poet might be a good fit for the subject matter

also by Desnos- The Mirror and the World
(personally not one of my Desnos favorites, but might work for the gallery)

If I think of more, I'll let you know...

A good photography gallery asked me if I could help them find a good poem
&/or poems that deal with echoes, and or mirrors. (They be doing a book).
And the photographer is much into dealing with variously mirrored 'doubles'
- usually of the 'funk' flea market sort (cracked ceramic ears, matching
stereo speakers, etc.)

  Aphasia here when it comes to remembering texts/poems, appreciate any
suggestions.  Wally Stevens might be too mandarin for 'the case.'

  Thanks in advance,

  Stephen Vincent

  I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
Whatever I see I swallow immediately
Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
I am not cruel, only truthful-
The eye of the little god, four cornered.
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.
It is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long
I think it is a part of my heart. But it flickers.
Faces and darkness separate us over and over.
Now I am a lake. A woman bends over me,
Searching my reaches for what she really is.
Then she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.
I see her back, and reflect it faithfully.
She rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.
I am important to her. She comes and goes.
Each morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.
In me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman
Rises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.

A good photography gallery asked me if I could help them find a good poem &/or poems that deal with echoes, and or mirrors. (They be doing a book). And the photographer is much into dealing with variously mirrored 'doubles' - usually of the 'funk' flea market sort (cracked ceramic ears, matching stereo speakers, etc.)

WRITING WORKSHOPS AT THE POETRY PROJECT:
=20
BASIC AND BOLD: LOGOS R US =AD PATRICIA SPEARS JONES
TUESDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 9TH
=20
Every writer finds a niche, a gesture, the thing that works in what they do=
.
At some point it may become a style or convention.  Sometimes it becomes a
crutch.  One way to break the mode is to be radical=8Bthat is, return to the
roots.  What brought you to poetry in the first place? This is a workshop
for writers who want to re-look at how the structure and elements of poetry
provide the wherewithal to make poems that are as ambitious, thoughtful and
innovative as you want them to be. There will be in class writing,
assignments, reading, and a revision project called =8BCAN THIS POEM BE
SAVED?=8B in which you bring a poem that simply has not come to closure; seem=
s
to be stuck; or needs to be looked at by fresh eyes in the hope of finding
what could make it work. This workshop is geared toward writers who have
been seriously writing for some time.  Please submit 5-8 pages of poetry an=
d
a brief description of what you=B9d like to accomplish in the workshop by
September 28. African American poet, playwright and cultural commentator,
Patricia Spears Jones is author of two collections, Femme du Monde and The
Weather That Kills.
=20

POETRY LAB: FORMS OF JOYFUL EXPERIMENTATION =AD
TODD COLBY=20
FRIDAYS AT 7PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 12TH

In this workshop we'll forge new paths to the poem by investigating how far
a poem can depart from being =B3a poem=B2 and yet still be a poem. We'll
experiment with breath, heartbeat, movement, blogs, the alchemy of words,
visions, letters to the editor, spontaneity, psychoanalysis, collaborations=
,
appropriations and self-hypnosis, along with various traditional forms. The
main objective is to create a supportive and inviting atmosphere in our
joyfully experimental "Lab." A partial reading list will include: Hannah
Weiner, Jacques Lacan, Gertrude Stein, Diane Williams, David Markson,
Miranda July, Thomas Bernhard, Bill Knott, Arthur Rimbaud, Alice Notley,
Mina Loy, Charles Olson, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Todd Colby is the author
of Tremble & Shine, Riot in the Charm Factory, Cush, and Ripsnort, all of
which were published by Soft Skull Press.
=20

WORLDLY AND INFINITELY DIMENSIONAL:
A WORKSHOP =AD RACHEL LEVITSKY
SATURDAYS AT 12PM: 10 SESSIONS BEGIN OCTOBER 13
=20
In these times, the possibilities by which we may amplify, record, document=
,
display, shape, formulate, and publish words increases daily. Although
expanded media and its wide reach are in themselves a meaningful fact of ou=
r
times, they don=B9t necessarily enhance a poetry=B9s resonance. How do we, and
by we I mean both ourselves as ones and ourselves as groups, best construct
and perform our poetries so as to be present in these particular times and
yet open to the infinite possibilities of =B3projection,=B2 =B3conception,=B2
=B3performance=B2? Familiarizing ourselves with poets like Abigail Child, Julie
Patton, Cecilia Vicu=F1a, Bob Dylan, Linton Kwesi Johnson (some will be
visiting the workshop), we will consider all means available and any means
necessary to project living works into our world. Individually and
collaboratively we=B9ll construct performances, visual works, sound events,
improvisations, etc. Rachel Levitsky is the author of Under the Sun
(Futurepoem) and is the founder and co-editor of Belladonna Books.
=20
=20
The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one-year individual Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all fall spring and fall classes=
.
Reservations are required due to limited class space, and payment must be

There is a lovely issues of Jacket with several substantial essays and
responses to Creeley's work. Oct. 2006.

http://jacketmagazine.com/31/index.shtml

I can bear with Simic, free country, free speech, and all that, and yes he
is especially hard in his critique of Creeley's Pieces and that book is dear
to many on this list I think. He does have some generous things to say about
some late poems, as do I in my piece in the Jacket cited above. He has very
warm things to sat about Creeley as a friend and a human being.

What I wanted to say though is why not try to speak with passion to the
fever that stirs the engaged reader and be generous about sharing those
thoughts, leaving the bickering to less generous minds.

Subject: Creeley piece by Simic now out and online...


I checked early this morning and Simic's piece is now on the NYRB's
website.
But you have to pay $3 to read it or pay even more for an electronic
subscription.

The piece is basically Simic's review of the two latest collected Creeley
works (The CP of Robert Creeley, 1945â€“1975 & The CP of Creeley  1975â€“2005).
I
think it bears reading for Simic's attention to  Creeley's interviews (which
he quotes from) early on.  It seems to get a  bit thin two thirds of the way
through.  He heaps a lot of attention on  Creeley's early life with some bio
information and then a careful look at "For  Love" and then it gets ...
thin.

Some highlights:

He likes Creeley's early work:

"By broad agreement, For Love is Creeley's best book. There are at  least
two
dozen first-rate poems and the rest are almost all of very high  quality.
Words (1967), from which the poem about language I just quoted comes,  is an
uneven book, although it has several powerful poems..."

But loses interest with each succeeding volume of Creeley's  work...  He
doesn't consider "Pieces" (1969) very good...

"There are a few good poems in his earlier manner in Pieces, but the  rest
of
the book doesn't amount to much. Creeley confused ideas about poetry  with
poetry itself.  Creeley had ceased to be a lyric poet and become a
teacher-preacher type giving us classroom demonstrations of how poetry,
written  according
to a particular theory of poetry, works."

There are some especially slammy lines that follow this section...

"If poetics were like cooking and one could write down a recipe for all of
one's future poems, that would be true. However, great cooks rarely bother
to
consult cookbooks."

"This may sound harsh, but reading the hundreds of poems that Creeley wrote
after Pieces, I could not come to any other conclusion. The second volume,
The
 Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975â€“2005, which has poems written just
before he died in 2005, is especially hard going."

But then Simic finds something to praise in his last bit of work...

That's it pretty much.

It's in the October 25th issue of the New York Review of Books...

Subject:      Herschel Baron: Philadelphia Poet and Activist has passed away
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

I've posted this same annoucement with a photo of Herschel on The
PhillySound today:  http://PhillySound.blogspot.com


The news has just reached me that Herschel Baron died on October 1st of lung
cancer. The last time I saw him was on a bus going down Chestnut Street. He
had tubes in his nose, and he was very unstable on his feet. I was on my way
to see Frank Sherlock at Jefferson and it was a day or two after we had
learned his diagnosis was meningitis. Herschel couldn't see very well, but
he recognized my voice. When I told him about Frank he told me a story about
someone he knew who had died of meningitis years ago. My mind wasn't exactly
focused on what Herschel was saying so that's about all I remember, except
that as he stood to get off at his stop he told me to take care of myself
and that he hoped my friend would be okay.

That was nice, those parting words, now that I'm thinking about them. We
didn't always have nice words between us over the years. In 1984 when I
first met him he was very involved with New Formalist poet friends of his
who were being published in QRL (Quarterly Review of Literature). Herschel
had a way of talking to me like he needed to teach me something, saying
things like, "If you're not in QRL you're not worth being read," charming
things like that. Looking back I feel fortunate to have been raised by a
hotheaded mother and if I didn't like what I read then that was that.

There was one amazing incident I witnessed in the 1980s where I discovered
who he was and what he had been through in this world while at a reading for
the victims of MOVE. Herschel was one of the readers, and he made a big deal
about the taping of the reading, demanding to not be taped. Some people were
annoyed that he was making such a fuss. I asked Gil Ott why Herschel was
doing this. Gil told me how Herschel had lost his job back in the 50s at RCA
in Camden because he and other labor organizers were called into Senator
McCarthy's hearings and were accused of being communists. Herschel's life
was very difficult for some time after that, out of work, painted red,
tossed aside. It's something he never got over, so it seems when I think
about how he reacted to that taping of the MOVE event in the 80s, yelling,
"THEY JUST BURNED DOWN A WHOLE BLOCK OF THE CITY AND YOU TRUST THESE PEOPLE
TO NOT COME AFTER YOU!? YOU PEOPLE ARE NAIVE ABOUT HOW THIS WORLD WORKS!" He
had been very brave as a young man, stuck his neck out to help make the
world better for all his fellow workers. It was sad to see how haunted he
remained by the witch hunt he and his friends had endured. And although
Herschel and I never saw eye-to-eye on poetry, ever, I had a lot of respect
for the suffering he had gone through to help change the world.

Over the last few years I would see Herschel on Chestnut Street waiting for
a bus and we would talk, and it was always good, though he was worried about
his health, and before that worried about his wife's health. Once in a while
he would ask me if I still saw this poet, or that poet. He brought up Scott
Norman at one point. In particular the famous reading at Jimmy Tyoon's old
place The Middle East (I don't know what it's called now), where Scott
pulled a knife on Daniel Kiener in the middle of Daniel's poem about Israel
needing to defend the homeland. Herschel, and Etheridge Knight, and Lamont
Steptoe, Bob Small, and a whole lot of others were there, in fact I'm pretty
sure it was Jerome Rothenberg who tackled Scott, but maybe I'm wrong about
that. But Daniel was reading in his normal fashion, screaming, throwing his
fists up and down, his long, long white beard flying all over the place.
Scott jumped over a chair and lunged at him with a knife. It was just a
small knife, but still, it was a knife. While Scott was being restrained,
screaming about freeing the Palestinians with his face pushed into the
floor, Herschel took his pipe out of his mouth and started yelling, "WHY ARE
POETS SO GOD DAMNED CRAZY ALL THE TIME!? CAN'T WE EVER GET ALONG!? IT'S
CRAZY HOW WE ACT! CRAZY! CRAZY! CRAZY!" There was a lot of that kind of
drama back then, every week it seemed there was some new drama.

Even though Herschel was always trying to get me to understand the genius of
David Slavitt and other New Formalists, he had a healthy respect for Allen
Ginsberg. When Ginsberg read at the Painted Bride Arts Center one of the
people who clapped the loudest was Herschel. Ginsberg did a brilliant
reading of Sunflower Sutra, and it was so good that I have always hoped it
was taped. Anyway, I remember Herschel telling Ginsberg how we need more
brave poets like him, something like that, and Ginsberg gave him the
Buddhist prayer hands and nod and smile.

Herschel was a cranky, fierce old guy, even back in 1984 when I was just 18
he was old and fierce. While he was intolerant of poetry he didn't like, I
admire that he always let you know what he liked and didn't like. You never
had to second guess Herschel. He had no time for games because he took his
poetry seriously. And if you took it seriously as well, even if you didn't
agree with him, he enjoyed the opportunity to tell you how wrong you were.
In his own way I think that he valued those who valued poetry, no matter
what kind of poetry. I'll think of him on Chestnut Street.

Rest in peace,
CAConrad

The upcoming issue 12 at listenlight.net may surprise you.  She takes her
first step towards the Web 2.0 environment.

As the gurus at 37signals <http://37signals.com> say, "We do less than our
competition --- intentionally."  Can 50,000 readers a day be wrong?

Ideally, I would like to read works submitted now & over the weekend, select
a few rather finished ones, and then release the page early in the week.

Since several mention Plath and her mirror poem, what about one of her more
celebrated (and arguably much better) poems at the end of Ariel (not  her
ordering but the one most people know)..."Words."  The entire poem  is based
around echoes (echoes viewed as fate mostly)...it begins "Axes/after  whose stroke
the wood rings,/And the echoes!" And these words are the sort  one never
forgets: "Words dry and riderless / The indefatigable hoof-taps."  Mirrors abound
in this collection...the two poems preceding this one "Kindness"  and
"Contusion" most feature mirrors prominently, as do many other  poems.....

In the spirit of whom she means to become, Listenlight 12 is released:
listenlight.net ---

Please note, the page loads a 250KB image for the content, requires a full
Ajax viewport, about 1000x800 pixels of real estate, maybe a good browser
(Firefox, Safari, Opera), and probably a post-modern CPU (1400MHz+)

So, if you like it, there's room for three more works, you see.  Round 'em
up, cowpokes.

Oh, & please add my Facebook app: GravityWay.  Thanks.

LAST REMINDER:


POETRY AT THE HISTORIC Z MANSION:

DAVID MELTZER &
MICHAEL ROTHENBERG
presented by CHAX PRESS, with help from POG



MONDAY, OCTOBER 8, 7:00pm

288 N. Church Ave. in downtown Tucson
$5 at the door, $3 for students (we don't turn anyone away)
Contact: Chax Press: 520-620-1626

In the last several years, CHAX PRESS and/or POG have established a
Tucson ground-breaking series of readings by such writers as Robert
Creeley, Robin Blaser, Joanne Kyger, Alice Notley, Bernadette Mayer,
and more, writers who were sparkplugs in the poetic revolution of the
1950s and 1960s that has changed the landscape of American poetry
from one of "tradition" to one of "energy," from an East
Coast-centered poetics of Quietude to a global practice of visionary
poetry. Within that seachange, David Meltzer is a must-see poet we
are fortunate to bring to Tucson. All the better that he is
accompanied by Michael Rothenberg, an outstanding poet who has also
edited the collected poems of several of those writers who entered
our poetic history from 1950 to 1965.

My friends, this is one not to be missed. Also look ahead to another
poet who is a part of this great American wave, David Gitin, together
with Frank Parker, presented by POG on October 27 at 7pm at Stone
Ave. Gallery, 2007 N. Stone.

Other upcoming Chax or POG and related events include
Oct. 9, Cushing Street Poetry, 198 W. Cushing St., 8pm: Jefferson
Carter & John Spaulding
Oct. 11, MOCA, 6pm, 174 E. Toole in downtown Tucson, poetry/poetics
lecture: "Away We Shall Float: Where Poems Take Us." MOCA Lit is
pleased to host award-wining poet and founder of Chax Press Charles
Alexander as he shares the pleasure of poetry as writer and reader.
Alexander will discuss his work vis a vis Hugo Ball and bpNichol
under the theme of poetry as the language of excess.
Oct. 14, noon to 5pm, UA Poetry Center Housewarming Festival. Reading
with music & more, at Poetry Center new location, 1508 E. Helen St.
Poets include Brenda Hillman, Charles Alexander, Richard Shelton,
Jane Miller, Robert Hass, Steve Orlen, Alberto Rios, Alison Deming, & more.

Chax Press & POG events are made possible in part by contributions
from the Tucson Pima Arts Council and the Arizona Commission on the
Arts, with funding from the State of Arizona and the National
Endowment for the Arts.

Dear Steve:

Je suis Francoys dont il me poise
Ne de Paris empres Pontoise
Et de la corde d'une toise
Scaura mon col que mon cul poise.

Galway Kinnel translates this as:

I am Francois which is my cross
Born in Paris near Pontoise
From a fathom of rope my neck
Will learn the weight of my ass

Yes, the short quatrain was written by Villon while awaiting
hanging--his third such occaision, having miraculously been at last
moment twice before been pardoned and not hung as sentenced-- though
he was as was the custom tortured and imprisoned for some time--on all
occaisions--

(Many of the tortures then employed not so different from the ones
used today at Gitmo and around the "civilized" world--)

  Villon was awaiting death in the worst cells of the Chatelet prison
when he composed the quatrain and following that  oneof his greatest
ballads, "Freres humains, qui apres nous vivez . . "  sometimes called
"The Ballad of the Hanged"--

      The document for the commutation of his sentence to ten yearse
xile from the city of Paris still  exists, though even with it it is
not clear why this was done.  There is some speculation that one of
the three judges who sat on his appeal,  Henri Thiboust, President of
Parliament having been a friend of the man who was Villon's guardian
and a fellow canon, (Guillaume de Villon) interceded and had the
sentence commuted.

       Villon was given three days to get ready, then escorted to the
gates of Paris--and never heard of again.  As he himself had pointed
out in some lines already, he was 33, the same age as Christ when He
was crucified.

     The little quatrain has the characteristic paradoxical
Villonesque ironic, gallows humor and at the same time a deep sense of
Faith and a kind of honesty and "sincerity".  A lot of his poems are
listings of such paradoxes, how things that are the opposite are also
very much the same. It's a kind of "leveling" vision which can both be
devastatingly annihilating of all social institutions and shams, and
at the same time a vision of spiritual liberation out of the worst of
circumstances, situations, places, events and people. This kind of
doubled vision makes for the humor in Villon's works--the mocking
laugh of the skull face in the face of plagues, wars, famines, poverty
and riches, prostitutes and Queens, beggars and Kings, theives and
educated persons.  Since Villon was both a well educated person and a
theif, a killer of a Priest (got off on self-defense) and most likely
a pimp, he and his work embody the paradoxes he creates with.

      Villon was born the same year Ste Jeanne d'Arc was burned at the
stake, at the end of the Hundred Years War which had destroyed almost
all of about half of present day France.  There was a period of
vicious winters in which wolves roamed the streets of Paris,
especially at night, killing and eating humans.  Disease was rampant,
horrific poverty, and an underground network of thieves employing the
"Jargon" often found in Villon's poetry were everywhere.  It was an
extremely brutal time period, and also one of a lot of laughter,
pranks, festivals and festivities, feasts of all sorts. The period of
the "Danse Macabre."   Villon and a bit later Rabelais used the
language of the streets mixed with theological terms --and much more,
in Rabelais, being a doctor, of many other terminologies, which he
outrageously satirizes.  Villon's poetry in his lifetime and after,
before being collected and published, was memorized and reciited and
sung in streets, drinking holes, whore houses, the university all over
Paris.

       Two great books on Villon are Francois Villon  by D. B. Wyndham
Lewis, which includes a lot of documents--and Danse Macabre:  Francois
Villon Poetry and Murder in Medieval  France .   Villon is one of my
all time favorite poets by far and have done various art works etc in
homage to him.

The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975=962005
by Robert Creeley

University of California Press, 662 pp., $49.95

I loved Herrick, I loved the scale and deftness of his sounds. I =20
loved, what little I knew of Campion.... I loved the so-called =20
Jacobeans, I mean, really a kind of hip mournfulness I really thought =20=

was great.[1]

What is the explanation for the large number of volumes of collected =20
poems appearing in the last few years? Publishers are bringing out =20
books of breathtaking ambition, each one containing hundreds of poems =20=

by a single poet, as if there was a huge, untapped market for every =20
poem ever written by every dead and living American poet. In place of =20=

pocket-sized volumes or lean collections of selected poems one can =20
comfortably read to oneself on a park bench or to a lover in bed, one =20=

is confronted by a tome that requires for its perusal a sturdy table.

There's also the challenge of sheer quantity. Unless one is an inmate =20=

serving a life sentence in a state penitentiary, a book of a thousand =20=

poems is nearly impossible to read, since the concentration and =20
enthusiasm such an undertaking requires can only infrequently be =20
summoned. More to the point, there are not many poets, even among our =20=

best ones, who are likely to have more than eighty pages worth =20
reading. Of course, there are exceptions. Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, =20
and Stevens tend to be engrossing even when they are not at their =20
best, though that claim is debatable. With all that in mind, the =20
publication of any poet's collected poems is bound to evoke both =20
curiosity and dread, even a poet one has previously held in high regard.

There was a time when Robert Creeley was a cult figure, a poet nearly =20=

as famous as Allen Ginsberg and Robert Lowell. His 1962 book For Love =20=

was much admired. The old master himself, William Carlos Williams, =20
said that Creeley had the subtlest feeling for the measure that he =20
had encountered anywhere except in the verses of Ezra Pound, whom he =20
could not equal. His poems seemed both adventurous and old-fashioned. =20=

They had a colloquial ease and the fragmented look of modern poetry, =20
but they also contained rhymes, archaic words, and a rhetoric that =20
often had as much in common with Williams and Pound as with Herrick =20
and Campion. They were almost all about love, a subject of =20
considerable interest to a vast number of human beings that for some =20
curious reason is absent from the work of many of our poets today, =20
who, unlike poets in other cultures, generally stay away from any =20
overt expression of erotic feelings, as if love and sex were of =20
little concern to them.

Creeley not only wrote keenly about love, he was also a man with =20
interesting ideas about literature. A member of the little-understood =20=

but already fabled circle of poets that included Charles Olson, =20
Robert Duncan, Denise Levertov, Paul Blackburn, and Ed Dorn, he came =20
across as both a poet and an intellectual. "He seemed to have his =20
sights on and be in touch with every aspect of what was new and vital =20=

going on then," Michael Rumaker remembered.[2] A slight, stooped =20
figure with an eye patch and shy manners, he read his poems in a low, =20=

barely audible voice with a seriousness and intensity that was both =20
mystifying and attractive.

Of course, everyone who saw him read wondered what happened to the =20
eye. In an unpublished autobiographical note written in 1966, he =20
gives a brief mention of the accident:

I was raised in Massachusetts for the most part, having been born in =20
Arlington, May 21, 1926, son of a physician who died when I was four. =20=

That and the loss of my left eye when I was a little younger mark for =20=

me two conditions I have unequivocally as content, but which I have =20
neither much bitterness about nor other specific feeling. I did miss =20
my father certainly. With him went not only the particular warmth he =20
might have felt for me, but also the whole situation of our life as =20
we had apparently known it.[3]

The father's death impoverished the family. They moved to a small =20
farm in West Acton and his mother got a job as a public health nurse =20
to support Robert and his older sister. He said that kids like him in =20=

West Acton went hunting and did not go out for sports. "They shot =20
deer during the winter to eat and they counted each bullet. Wasting a =20=

single bullet was a crime."[4] Creeley eventually received a =20
scholarship and attended the Holderness School in Plymouth, New =20
Hampshire, where he later claimed he received the most relevant part =20
of his education. His time at Harvard was shorter and much less =20
happy. He made a few friends, met his first wife there, but ended up =20
being suspended for stealing a door from Lowell House. He joined the =20
American Field Service in 1944 and became an ambulance driver in =20
Burma and India. After the war ended, Creeley returned to Cambridge, =20
where his mother and sister were then living, and he was reinstated =20
at Harvard. He became involved in literary activities at the =20
university, had his first poem published, and married an old school =20
friend in the spring of 1946. They relocated to Truro on Cape Cod, =20
then he dropped out of Harvard in his final semester, wearied by the =20
long commute and convinced that the courses he was taking were of no =20
use to him.

Next, his wife bought a farm near Littleton, New Hampshire, where =20
they bred pigeons and chickens which they showed in poultry =20
exhibitions around New England. In August 1950, he began writing =20
letters to Charles Olson, who was then living in Washington, D.C. =20
Once their correspondence was collected, the one thousand letters =20
covering the years from 1950 to 1952 ran into nine volumes. Without =20
meeting face to face, they wrote to each other daily, Creeley often =20
twice a day. He thought of himself at the time as a short story writer=20=

=97he was already publishing stories in leading literary journals=97and =20=

an aspiring man of letters who would model himself on Pound and =20
Williams, with whom he was also corresponding.

Olson, an ex=96letter carrier, ex-fisherman, ex=96Democratic Party =20
official, and an employee of the Federal Office of War Information, =20
had already written his book on Melville and some poems, and was =20
working on his soon-to-be-famous essay "Projective Verse," which was =20
shortly to appear in the magazine Poetry New York. In it, he argued =20
for "open form poetry" in which traditional ideas of form would be =20
replaced by poems in which form would depend on the content. In other =20=

words, the right form for a poem trying to describe a red wheelbarrow =20=

next to a couple of white chickens, or one about staring into a =20
bathroom mirror at midnight, is to be found in the experience itself =20
and is not to be imposed mechanically from outside. So understood, =20
form is not what Shakespeare and Keats thought it was, but the =20
property of the content and the language of every experience.

Creeley and Olson discussed these matters in their letters, exchanged =20=

poems, recommended books to each other, complained about the =20
ignorance and stupidity of magazine editors, and raised each other's =20
spirits. Not that they had much in common. Like Pound, Olson saw the =20
role of a poet as a teacher, someone who makes new ideas available to =20=

his readers. Creeley thought that what defines our poetry is the =20
prototypical American proclivity since Whitman and Dickinson for =20
speaking in the name of an extraordinary single self, which =20
nevertheless feels itself to be representative.

Olson became the rector of Black Mountain College, a small =20
experimental college in North Carolina founded in 1933 that had =20
attracted, both as teachers and students, a great many artists, =20
writers, and musicians, such as Franz Kline, John Cage, Merce =20
Cunningham, Willem de Kooning, and Paul Goodman. He soon invited =20
Creeley to edit a magazine that he hoped would attract attention to =20
the college, which had at that point barely two dozen students left. =20
Creeley accepted. The magazine was called The Black Mountain Review =20
and was almost impossible to get hold of except in a few little =20
bookstores around the country. Still, it circulated among poets and =20
was exciting to read since it had poems and essays by Olson, Duncan, =20
Levertov, and Creeley, whose ideas and work were far more intriguing =20
than what one usually encountered in university quarterlies. Not =20
until 1962, when Scribner brought out Creeley's For Love: Poems 1950=96=20=

1960, was it possible to have some sense of what his poetry was like =20
unless one happened to come across one of his small-press books =20
published in Spain or in North Carolina. Among the 135 mostly very =20
short poems in that volume, this one is his most famous and most =20
anthologized:

I KNOW A MAN

     As I sd to my
     friend, because I am
     always talking,=97John, I

     sd, which was not his
     name, the darkness sur-
     rounds us, what

     can we do against
     it, or else, shall we &
     why not, buy a goddamn big car,

     drive, he sd, for
     christ's sake, look
     out where yr going.

For such a little poem, "I Know a Man" has had a vast number of =20
interpretations, some of them downright peculiar. My favorite one =20
contends that the speaker of the poem is Jesus Christ and the "John" =20
is John the Baptist. Creeley allowed that there's something Puritan =20
about the poem, in a sense of "Cool it!" "You're becoming =20
excessive...."[5] His letters to Olson often mention his desire to =20
get away from Littleton where he felt himself to be, as he said in =20
his story "The Island," "the writer on perpetual vacation on his =20
wife's money."[6] In one of the letters he describes two young men =20
stopping to ask for directions. After they leave, he fantasizes how =20
nice it would be to have a Lincoln Continental and to go cruising at =20
sixty or seventy miles per hour down some long stretch of highway =20
with a cool bottle of wine and just yourself for company. As in a =20
number of other Creeley poems, the conflict here is between two sides =20=

of the self, one of which wants to escape some routine by imagining =20
another kind of life and the practical other who reminds the dreamer =20
that there are dire consequences for not paying attention to matters =20
at hand.

The poem sounds like a bit of overheard conversation carefully =20
transcribed. Each line break and the slight pause it necessitates =20
indicate the speed at which the poem is to be read. The function of =20
such a line is to weight the various things we are being told and to =20
convey the tone of voice. Prosody for Creeley was the method of =20
controlling the reader's temporal and auditory experience of the =20
poem. Form was not an abstract concept. It was up to the poet to =20
recognize that some bit of speech is already a poem that requires as =20
little tampering as possible. In his literary essays, one of his main =20=

interests is the study of poetic consciousness and the scrutiny of =20
the ways in which language is used. Writing for him was as much about =20=

that process as it was about any given subject.

Creeley's love poems from this period have the same quality of =20
extreme self-consciousness and introspection. Their speaker seeks to =20
understand love, because, he claims, all that he knows comes from =20
what it has taught him. Creeley is not an erotic poet. His women are =20
rarely physically present in the poems. He has more in common with =20
poets of courtly love than with Ovid or Catullus, who wrote =20
explicitly about the naked body. "The glorious lady of my mind," as =20
Dante calls Beatrice in La Vita Nuova, is also Creeley's worry. And =20
yet that ethereal vision is in daily conflict with the demands of =20
sharing the same bed and living under the same roof with a real =20
woman, who may or may not care for him, a relationship that requires =20
constant corroboration with all the accompanying risks:

THE BUSINESS

     To be in love is like going out-
     side to see what kind of day

     it is. Do not
     mistake me. If you love

     her how prove she
     loves also, except that it

     occurs, a remote chance on
     which you stake

     yourself? But barter for
     the Indian was a means of sustenance.

     There are records.

Many years ago, writing about Creeley's early poems, Cid Corman =20
observed that they are never quite lighthearted, that they are mostly =20=

about taking oneself to task for some highly charged and invariably =20
screwed-up relationship. They are addressed to a particular woman, =20
often in a form of apology, and deal with his attempt to explain =20
himself and hopefully be forgiven. This is love poetry of constant =20
self-doubt, of guilty feelings, both real and imaginary, that, at =20
least in this one poem, make for a nice bit of domestic comedy as the =20=

husband snoring away next to his wife dreams of another woman:

THE WHIP

     I spent a night turning in bed,
     my love was a feather, a flat

     sleeping thing. She was
     very white

     and quiet, and above us on
     the roof, there was another woman I

     also loved, had
     addressed myself to in

     a fit she
     returned. That

     encompasses it. But now I was
     lonely, I yelled,

     but what is that? Ugh,
     she said, beside me, she put

     her hand on
     my back, for which act

     I think to say this
     wrongly.

No one frets more about the proper use of words than poets and =20
lovers. Their intention is to eroticize language, make each word have =20=

the effect of a glance or a touch. They speak in hope that an =20
overworked phrase like "I love you," which countless millions have =20
said millions of times and continue to say every day, each one in his =20=

or her tone of voice, and never twice in the same way, will ring true =20=

for this particular person, in this particular moment, and will =20
convey all of its overt and latent meanings and be reciprocated in =20
some fashion:

THE LANGUAGE

     Locate I
     love you some-
     where in

     teeth and
     eyes, bite
     it but

     take care not
     to hurt, you
     want so

     much so
     little. Words
     say everything.

     I
     love you
     again,

     then what
     is emptiness
     for. To

     fill, fill.
     I heard words
     and words full

     of holes
     aching. Speech
     is a mouth.

Words are holes waiting to be filled by our need. They bring into =20
being something out of nothing. The lover and the poet have that in =20
common. They know that no words ever do justice to what they are =20
feeling=97even as they continue to use them. The mind awake to its =20
inability to say what it is=97 this is the subject of many of Creeley's =20=

poems. "I see no progress in time or any other such situation. So it =20
is that what I feel, in the world, is the one thing I know myself to =20
be, for that instant. I will never know myself otherwise," he writes. =20=

What he ends up espousing is a form of solipsism which holds that the =20=

primary reality for the self is the mind and its sole truth is the =20
immediate and unshared experience that occurs there. Even when he =20
writes of love, he says less of the object of his affection and far =20
more of his own perceptions and emotions. His philosophical problem =20
may be described this way: If my mind is all I can be sure of, how =20
will I ever be able to get to know you, my love?

By broad agreement, For Love is Creeley's best book. There are at =20
least two dozen first-rate poems and the rest are almost all of very =20
high quality. Words (1967), from which the poem about language I just =20=

quoted comes, is an uneven book, although it has several powerful =20
poems like the one (called "Something") about a man watching a woman =20
in a rented room take a pee in a sink after they have made love. Such =20=

specifics are rare in his work. Ordinarily, his lovers, friends, and =20
the places he travels to are not shown in any detail. Poetry denies =20
its end in any descriptive act, Creeley has insisted, since it leaves =20=

the attention outside the poem. That is why one finds very few =20
metaphors and almost no similes in his poetry. The search for what =20
this or that is "like" necessitates that one divide one's attention, =20
absent oneself for a moment in the imagination, and that won't do:


Poetry seems to be written momently=97that is, it occupies a moment of =20=

time.... I seem to be given to work in some intense moment of =20
whatever possibility, and if I manage to gain the articula-tion =20
necessary in that moment, then happily there is the poem.[7]

If this is true=97and it is not true for most poets=97all we can expect =20=

from Creeley's poetry will be jottings, words and phrases about his =20
state of mind which will rely on his knack for colloquial speech to =20
conceal the paucity of content. Creeley's next book, Pieces (1969), =20
is all about such poetry. Having convinced himself that the only =20
authentic act for a poet is to report what is in his mind at the time =20=

of writing, Creeley eschews even the beginnings and endings of poems, =20=

since they now seem to him an arbitrary bracketing of what Jack =20
Kerouac called "an undisturbed flow of the mind." This is what that =20
looks like:

A STEP

     Things
     come and go.
     Then
     let them.
     HAVINGTO=97
     what do I think
     to say now.
     Nothing but
     comes and goes
     in a moment.
     *
     Cup.
     Bowl.
     Saucer.
     Full.
     *
     The way into the form,
     the way out of the room=97

     The door, the hat,
     the chair, the fact...

The sequence has seven more parts, but even this much ought to be =20
enough to show the slightness of such poetry. More promising are the =20
poems Creeley wrote about numbers zero to nine for the painter Robert =20=

Indiana. Here's a section about the number "Seven":

     I was born at seven in
     the morning and my
     father had a monument
     of stone, a pillar, put
     at the entrance of the
     hospital, of which he was head.

There are a few good poems in his earlier manner in Pieces, but the =20
rest of the book doesn't amount to much. Creeley confused ideas about =20=

poetry with poetry itself. Some reviewers tried their best to indulge =20=

him. His old friend Denise Levertov said that Pieces is a romantic =20
book, by a poet whose previous work had often been impressively =20
classic. Because of its energy, candor, mystery, and try-anything =20
courage, she found the new poems exciting. Others were less generous. =20=

In The New Republic, Reed Whittemore found the whole project =20
didactic. Creeley had ceased to be a lyric poet and become a teacher-=20
preacher type giving us classroom demonstrations of how poetry, =20
written according to a particular theory of poetry, works.

In the introduction to a volume of his earliest and previously =20
uncollected poems, The Charm (1967), Creeley offers his own =20
explanation of what he was up to. I quote next to the last paragraph:


One time in conversation with Allen Ginsberg late at night, when we =20
were both in Vancouver in 1963, he very generously said to me, you =20
don't have to worry so much about writing a "bad" poem. You can =20
afford to now. I don't know that my nature will ever allow me that =20
understanding, which has not finally to do with some pompous self-=20
regard=97but rather with the fact that we are human beings and do live =20=

in the variability of that order. We don't know all we think we do, =20
nor would it even be very interesting if we did. Another friend, =20
Robert Duncan, has always insisted, with high intelligence, I think, =20
that poetry is not some ultimate preserve for the most rarified and =20
articulate of human utterances, but has a place for all speech and =20
all occasions thereof.

The most charitable interpretation of these two awful pieces of =20
advice is that Ginsberg was pulling his leg and Duncan meant =20
something else. American poetry is full of daybooks, poets who report =20=

everything they see and think and who keep doing the same thing for =20
years, but they usually pay better attention to what goes on around =20
them than he does, filling their poems with nicely observed details =20
and memorable stories. Not Creeley. He doesn't gossip, doesn't =20
confess secrets, doesn't have a rich imaginative life, doesn't write =20
about nature or cities, and has nothing to say about history. His =20
kind of poem, he informs us in his Paris Review interview, is done in =20=

one sitting, literally in the time it takes to type it or otherwise =20
write it, usually without any process of revision. The aesthetic =20
theory=97and there is always a theory behind such reductive views=97may =20=

sound persuasive, but it was foolish on Creeley's part to believe =20
that it could ever validate a poem. If poetics were like cooking and =20
one could write down a recipe for all of one's future poems, that =20
would be true. However, great cooks rarely bother to consult cookbooks.

This may sound harsh, but reading the hundreds of poems that Creeley =20
wrote after Pieces, I could not come to any other conclusion. The =20
second volume, The Collected Poems of Robert Creeley, 1975=962005, =20
which has poems written just before he died in 2005, is especially =20
hard going. The better poems are rare and come after many pages of =20
banal musings on aging, decline of his faculties, and death, in a =20
language that is flat and thoroughly predictable. This surprised me. =20
I knew Creeley for over forty years and enjoyed his talk, which was =20
always full of interesting stories and ideas, and now reading his =20
interviews feel the same way, but there is little evidence of that =20
quality of mind in his work after 1975, with poem after poem =20
consisting either of superficial remarks or descriptions so general =20
that they are instantly forgettable:

     Sitting at table=97
     good talk
     with good people.

On rare occasions, when he comes out of himself and remembers William =20=

Carlos Williams's injunction "no ideas but in things," to actually =20
look closely at the world around him, he is a far better poet:

FIRST RAIN

     These retroactive small
     instances of feeling

     reach out for a common
     ground in the wet

     first rain of a faded
     winter. Along the grey

     iced sidewalk revealed
     piles of dogshit, papers,

     bits of old clothing, are
     the human pledges,

     call them, "We are here and
     have been all the time." I

     walk quickly. The wind
     drives the rain, drenching

     my coat, pants, blurs
     my glasses, as I pass.

BUFFALO EVENING

     Steady, the evening fades
     up the street into sunset
     over the lake. Winter sits

     quiet here, snow piled
     by the road, the walks stamped
     down or shoveled. The kids

     in the time before dinner are
     playing, sliding on the old ice.
     The dogs are out, walking,

     and it's soon inside again,
     with the light gone. Time
     to eat, to think of it all.

Then, just as it seems that "the cat went out for good," in the last =20
years of his life Creeley recovers some of his old touch. Among the =20
many so-so poems about travel, family, deaths of friends, remorse of =20
conscience, homages to other poets, and diary-like entries about =20
miscellaneous items, one finds memorable fragments and a few truly =20
fine poems, like the delightful eight-part sequence called "The Dogs =20
of Auckland," written in long lines and full of comic touches and =20
sharply observed details. Undoubtedly, there is a conflict in =20
Creeley's later work. He continued to believe that some bit of =20
language that came out of the blue could be a poem, while in fact the =20=

more conventional lyrics and longer narrative poems that required =20
additional tinkering served him better. It's a pity that he felt the =20
need to remain faithful to ideas about composition long after it =20
became clear that they not only were limiting him but were a dead =20
end. Given the circumstances, a small volume of his selected (and =20
mostly early) poems would have been preferable to the first volumes =20
of collected poems. It would recall to us what a wild, pure, and =20
original voice he once had and continues to have for his devoted =20
readers:

AFTER LORCA

     The church is a business, and the rich
     are the business men.
     When they pull on the bells, the
     poor come piling in and when a poor man dies, he has a
     wooden
     cross, and they rush through the ceremony.

     But when a rich man dies, they
     drag out the Sacrament
     and a golden Cross, and go doucement, doucement
     to the cemetery.

     And the poor love it
     and think it's crazy.

From today's Washington Post, a quote from a visit to Lyn Cheney, new author of "Blue Skies, No Fences: A Memoir of Childhood and Family," (through 1958):

 ...Now, she is tucked into a favorite chair in the sunroom at the vice president's residence, a home she will inhabit for 15 more months. The room -- which she redecorated, like much of the residence, to remind her of Wyoming -- is done in neutral tones, with a framed map of the Cheneys' home state on the wall and a sculpture of an elk on a table. (In the adjacent library, there is a buffalo sculpture under a table; there is also an entire shelf of fishing books, including two intimidatingly large tomes titled "Trout, Volume I" and "Trout, Volume II.")...

 Not to be uppity or easy, but it does not look like modernism, or post-modernism in either art or books has ever crossed the Vice-President's threshold of awareness! What's there appears pure 19th century. I would be surprised if there were not multi-point buck antlers over the fire place. The site would appear to be a rich point of departure for, at least, theater or an installation work in which the 21st century would be im/exploding about the edges (Photographs of  Blackwater contractors blazing away in Baghda humvees, trophy Al-Queda captives being tortured in the basement, etc.), while Vice-President's wife continues to  rhapsodize about the joys of dating in 1958 in her junior year in the Veep's convertible in downtown Caspar, Wyoming.
 To quote Marianne Moore in the Steeplejack:
          ...it is a privilege to see so
 much confusion...

There are all those Creeley poems called "Echo" (plenty in the second vol. of the Collected). Also a lovely Michael Palmer poem-set by that title; I can't remember which book it's from, but it's in the "In the American Tree" anthology. And Robin Blaser's early books ("Charms" and the first "Image-Nations," both in "The Holy Forest") have a lot of shattered mirrors). There's also a fine Jack Spicer poem from "After Lorca" (in the "Collected Books") that ends with a shattered mirror... I can't remember the title of that one.

  All of these may be too indirect for the purpose at hand... but they're awful good.

  cheers,

I would argue that however a talented poet, he is not
a great poet - and RC was. I find it particularly
convenient for him to crisize a contemporary, and
especially, I think, mercernary, so soon after his
death. And, of course, they are competing for the
same, valid space. RC was RC. He was a bastard, so
many people have said. Maybe this is what it is about.
He once verbally abused a student, during the train of
a bender, for saying Eliot was more talented than WCW.
Someone put that article on this list, that would be
glorious sharing and genuine community.

Subject:      The true world.
MIME-Version: 1.0

The true world.


I wouldn't have been writing this or sitting here, the equivalent of your
thought at this moment, perhaps decades ago, the screen is transparent,
absent, ascii is natural crystal. If ascii is not natural crystal, then
assembly language is natural crystal. If assembly language is not natural
crystal, then machine language is natural crystal. I would say that in the
true world every signifier is hard-wired, every sign is true.

Every signifier is hard-wired, every signifier has hard-substrate, if not
in the true world, then in the temporal. Every sign is true, how might a
sign be false?, signs are true in the true world, there is no other world.

Every world is virtual world, the screen reflects the virtual world if the
screen is clear, reflective. Virtual worlds are screened in the true
world, they are screened with true signs, there are signs in virtual
worlds which are signs in true worlds, virtual worlds are true worlds.

There are judgments in the true world, judges in the true world, there
are splits and splinters, one true world parents another, and another and
this is the way of true worlds, this splintering or netting, each
successor or antecedent, descendent or ancestor, each simultaneous in the
true world which is the world of true worlds parenting and simultaneous.

I sit here and I am in the same world, true world, and you are in the same
true world, and your world splits and my world splits, and we are together
in the true world of parenting true worlds and simultaneous.

We are always gathered together in the true world, we are gatherings in
the true world, we are skein and membrane, warp of woof of the true world
which is gatherings of gatherings of our gatherings and of true worlds.

Yes, but, "La tautologie est certainement rigoureuse, mais certainement
inapplicable et sterile. Dans sa pure forme, hors du contenu, la pensee
cesse d'etre pensee." (H. Lefebvre, logique formelle, logique dialectique)
Is there anything other than gatherings, of which tautologie is both
kernel and restriction, category collapse, for example equivalence which
shudders as such, "Now we are in the position of having an enormous body
of mathematics, large parts of which are _secretly_ the decategorified
residues of deeper truths, without knowing exactly which parts these are.
For example, any equation involving natural numbers may be the decate-
gorification of an isomorphism between finite sets." (John C. Baez, James
Dolan, "From Finite Sets to Feynman Diagrams," in Engquist and Schmid,
Mathematics Unlimited - 2001 and Beyond) For example perhaps tautology
expands (beyond the realization that it _remains_ nothing but (constric-
ted) symbols on a page.

Natural crystal is already transient, if not now, when? One replies con-
tinuously in the course, among the courses, of gatherings of true worlds.

One might ask, why are there things, why are there things here, as if for
a longer time, as if things were like higher languages, as if both were
the true world, as if gatherings were sets or collocations of the other,
always thinging? For this is the question, how logic appears, that is, how
it makes appearance, how it appears to us. And one might reply, this is
the result of potential wells, as if the real, the true world, were
obdurate, which it is not. The fire next time is the plasma beforehand and
the plasma after, it is the virtual particle and its gatherings in the
true world.

Every thing that is appearance, every symbol that appears within the pot-
ential well of things that are gatherings, every hard-wiring is a masquer-
ade. Every gathering is a party, every party is a gathering, parentings
and parenteds, every symbolic formation becomes a letting go, releasing,
every releasing a vanishing, every vanishing a gathering. The true world
is a vanishing, the screen is a releasing, collapsed potential well, a
gathering.

All signs are true in the true world, all signs have vanished.

Pavement Saw Press and David Baratier

October 5th, 2007 by alan

In recent research I’ve been conducting, I came across the following post
on the Poetics listserv out of Buffalo. It’s from David Baratier of
Pavement Saw Press, from April of this year.

It frustrates me to see someone so self-righteously denounce Foetry.com’s
work, particularly in light of the fact that I did not write _one word_ of
the paragraph he attributed to me. Another forum member, Monday Love,
wrote it. Baratier was completely careless in this post. And no, I’m not
against all contests either. And I’m pro Monday Love too.

Thank you for allowing me to correct the record.

    Subject: Agni needs a spine
    In-Reply-To: Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1The situation
with foetry affects all of us. It is apparent from my
    interactions with foetry that Alan Cordle is against all contests,
even an
    honest one. Foetry first went after me insinuating that I appeared in the
    Denver Quarterly because I had Bin Ramke as a judge. That statement
sat on
    their site for many months even after the timeline was shown to them that
    proved that the accusation was false. I am not sure why we were brought
    onto their site except for an apparent need of Cordle to attack Ramke and
    anyone who used him as a judge. The passage below written by Cordle is
yet
    another instance of his making things up without evidence:
    ————————- Let’s see. Please tell me if I got anything
    wrong. David Baratier’s letters and poems have appeared in the Denver
    Quarterly, editor Bin Ramke, professor, University of Denver. Baratier is
    editor of Pavement Saw Press, in Ohio, which gets money from Ohio
    taxpayers in order to establish, according to Pavement Saw Press’s
mission
    statement, a “non-university affiliated press” which helps Ohio’s economy
    by attracting outside attention and publishing “works of national
    signifiance.” Dana Curtis, Ph.D. University of Denver, wins Pavement Saw
    Press Prize, picked by Ramke. Curtis is founder & editor-in-chief of
    Elixir Press, based in Denver. Jake Adam York, director of creative
    writing, University of Colorado at Denver, and Colorado Council on the
    Arts fellow, wins Elixir Press Prize. Sounds to me like
    university-affiliated Denver is the cat and the Ohio taxpayers are the
    cream. It looks like, so far at least, there’s a nice little Denver
system
    in place here. Very nice. ———————————————-
    Ok, Back to my side again The above written by Cordle is a total
    fabrication. York and Curtis didn’t know each other in fact, at the time
    Dana was in Minneapolis, not Denver I did not know Bin except for asking
    him to judge the contest and I asked him because I called to find out if
    they were going to run a interview I did with Simon Perchik (which
    appeared as a feature in an early issue of Jacket) and while he was on
the
    line I asked if he would be interested. I’ll just stop here. The whole
    thing is starting to bother me again. Our contest is blind judged, the
    manuscripts are stripped of the name and publication credits, if we can
    afford a judge, the judge is sent 25 manuscripts out of all recieved. If
    not I end up judging the batch I am sent back from the readers. If I am
    able to afford publishing two books (1000 run each) from the entries I
do.
    Then we pay to mail everyone at least their entry fee worth of books we
    have published. I think we run one of the fairest contests there is, I
    challenged Cordle to come up with a place that did better. I am still
    waiting. Anyway, my experience is that we would have something false
    written about us with no evidence, and once that material appeared on the
    foetry website it became my job to “prove him wrong.” I should also
    mention that Levine is one of our authors. And that (for the record,
as to
    avoid more wild speculation) his book won our contest before Tupelo was
    publishing. I also do not see why Levine being accused of a problem with
    the way he runs his press should affect the acceptance of his poems into
    journals. This is heading into an ugly direction, what is next? Will AGNI
    apologize about publishing poems if a poet is accused of running a
    red-light? Maybe AGNI should apologize for all of the poems they publish
    until they get a spine. Considering the student teacher problems with
    poetry awards and with contests who have chosen a winner beforehand, my
    amazement with Cordle is how inflated he is over the little he has
    revealed. Be well David Baratier, Editor Pavement Saw Press PO Box 6291

Not that I think RC was a bastard, or that many people
do - to correct something - but have heard stories
that many of us are already familiar with. "A very

I'd suggest a closer reading of the Simic review. Hint: it's not just
about Creeley.

I guess I'll have to do the close reading myself. It may be a couple
of days before I can get to it.

Actually the line in Under My Thumb is "It's down to me . . . "

American Woman is vile.  I second that one.

I never heard it, but there was a big splash on the internet about Alanis
Morrissette's version of Humps which was supposedly quite hilarious and
casts the song in a fairly different light.

I always argue with that one though-- it does have one critical bit of lyric
"Instead of me..."  which implies that the speaker felt that he was under
her thumb at one point.  So I just see it as a song about very human power
struggles.

I also agree that Stand by Your Man is rife with irony.  I have no problem
with it.

My vote would be for "American Woman"-- I really HATE that song.  And could
we pick the recent and very obvious "Humps"? Bleh.

Mrs. Cheney has actually had many words to say about modernism and
postmodernism.  None of them good.  None of it has probably literally
crossed her threshold and into her house, but she is all too conscious of
them and the way in which they have challenged and destroyed all that she
holds dear--personally and politically.

Subject: Lyn Cheney's domestic aesthetic

From today's Washington Post, a quote from a visit to Lyn Cheney, new author
of "Blue Skies, No Fences: A Memoir of Childhood and Family," (through
1958):

 ...Now, she is tucked into a favorite chair in the sunroom at the vice
president's residence, a home she will inhabit for 15 more months. The room
-- which she redecorated, like much of the residence, to remind her of
Wyoming -- is done in neutral tones, with a framed map of the Cheneys' home
state on the wall and a sculpture of an elk on a table. (In the adjacent
library, there is a buffalo sculpture under a table; there is also an entire
shelf of fishing books, including two intimidatingly large tomes titled
"Trout, Volume I" and "Trout, Volume II.")...

 Not to be uppity or easy, but it does not look like modernism, or
post-modernism in either art or books has ever crossed the Vice-President's
threshold of awareness! What's there appears pure 19th century. I would be
surprised if there were not multi-point buck antlers over the fire place.
The site would appear to be a rich point of departure for, at least, theater
or an installation work in which the 21st century would be im/exploding
about the edges (Photographs of  Blackwater contractors blazing away in
Baghda humvees, trophy Al-Queda captives being tortured in the basement,
etc.), while Vice-President's wife continues to  rhapsodize about the joys
of dating in 1958 in her junior year in the Veep's convertible in downtown
Caspar, Wyoming.
 To quote Marianne Moore in the Steeplejack:
          ...it is a privilege to see so
 much confusion...

Dear Alan Cordle---

David Baratier's post does not seem "completely careless" to me...
If, indeed, you are not "Monday Love," then maybe David's post is =20
slightly careless for not making it clear that you're not this person =20=

(if indeed you aren't)
Also, why do you use the term "self-righteously denounce" to describe =20=

Baratier's letter?
Baratier is doing no more than defending himself and trying to set =20
the record straight after having himself been 'denounced' in a piece =20
of writing sanctioned by Foetry--even if you yourself didn't write it.
(oh, we could debate on whether Foetry's denunciation of Baratier's =20
work is 'self-righteous' I suppose or simply 'righteous'--
but it's certainly a denunciation, and one based on innuendo and =20
spurious allegations).

Oh, and for the sake of full-disclosure, here as well, before you do =20
any more research,
yes, my first full-length book of poetry, back in 1994, was the first =20=

book Pavement Saw Press published
(the book is now out of print now, and, no, it was not supported by =20
any taxpayer's cream),
but this is not the reason I'm defending David against Foetry's =20
accusations
and I'm open to the possible usefulness of Foetry as a kind of =20
'watchdog' I suppose,
but in this case, there's more than enough evidence to support =20
Baratier's counter claims
and nothing but conjecture to support those posted by Foetry (even if =20=

not by you personally).

"Intercapillary Space" is today launching a blog symposium on the work of P=
eter Riley, the British poet. This will range over the next eleven days wit=
h a new article on the site every morning (timetable below). Readers are in=
vited to comment at length or in brief on what they find, maybe writing fur=
ther pieces to extend the symposium onwards.
=20

 To launch the symposium, a Peter Riley eBook:
This is a revision of a poem first published in Grosseteste Review X, 1977,=
 and it will be returned to by Michael Haslam in his forthcoming essay for =
this symposium. In that piece Haslam comments, "It stands out, like a mount=
ain peak or a sore thumb. It breaks the rules of several schools of poetry.=
 The poet must have wondered, Am I really writing this?" Peter Riley's comm=
ent on Haslam's piece will also discuss this poem.

While it seems incontrovertible that Creeley is immeasurably more of a poet than Simic, greater poets than Creeley have fallen off mightily from their early attainments--think of Whitman after 1865 (and look at how much fatter the "deathbed edition" of Leaves of Grass is than the 1865 edition, let alone the 1855 one). And have you perused Wordsworth's Sonnets on the Punishment of Death any time recently? Well, neither have I, but they ain't no Tintern Abbey, I'll tell you that. What's wrong with pointing such things out, if a critic finds them to be the case?

With due respect to my dear and brilliant friend
David, of course, there are many myths and much
speculation about Villon, often presented as fact, and
this sounds a little like one to me....
When it comes down to it, we know close to nothing
about him: we're not even sure about the name
(Montcorbier? Villon?...). Most of the ballad titles
were invented by Clement Marot. Much of his irony we
only understand by what we know about the people he
mentions.
I always just assume anything I read or am told about
Villon to be 95% scholarly or poetic fabrication.
But that doesn't make it any less appealing, does it
-- on the contrary!
Amicalement,
Alex

The Simic review could have been written in, what, 1965?  It's right
out of the grand tradition poetry wars, academics vs. New Americans,
etc, etc--is this your point, Mark?  The fact seems grimly obvious to
me....I was surprised that Simic didn't both taking a passing shot
at, say, "so-called 'language' poetry" or something of that sort.

I agree with you entirely (and thus disagree with Joshua) that,
however plausable the account of Creeley's post-1970 work Simic
offers, the poetics on which such an account is grounded is one that
would reject a great deal of work besides that of the later Creeley:

"American poetry is full of daybooks, poets who report everything
they see and think and who keep doing the same thing for years, but
they usually pay better attention to what goes on around them than he
does, filling their poems with nicely observed details and memorable
stories. "

"Nicely observed details and memorable stories," eh?  This is not
exactly in the great Romantic tradition of strong claims for poetry;
though it may be in the tradition of the most mediocre professional
instruction of creative writing.....

hey folks;
thot you might be interested in learing about a new anthology of poetry =
entitled 131.839 sl=F6g me=F0 bilum by Eir=EDkur =D6rn Nor=F0dahl, hot =
off the press from Leevi Lehto's new press:

***
"Few things supported the regeneration of Icelandic poetry in the =
fifties and sixties more than the collection "Foreign modern poetry". =
Here, Eir=EDkur =D6rn Nor=F0dahl, has played the same game, and chosen =
and translated poems by living foreign poets. Without a doubt the =
material in this book will be an inspiration to both young and older =
writers, besides showing us that once again we live in the golden age of =
the poem." - Sj=F3n

You are absolutely right. Mrs. Cheney would never permit any modernism to cross the family threshold (except for what she could not, apparently, stop happening to her daughter's 'life style' choices!). Her tenure as head of the National Endowment for the Humanities bore out her prejudices to the 'dollar denied'.  In any case, the juxtapostion between the 19th Century rural west family schtick - which borders on 'camp' or maybe 'camping'  - with the realities of say, life in contemporary Iraq is valuable to represent, and would be not doubt brave for the Washington Post to give a visual knock to.

Subject: Lyn Cheney's domestic aesthetic

From today's Washington Post, a quote from a visit to Lyn Cheney, new author
of "Blue Skies, No Fences: A Memoir of Childhood and Family," (through
1958):

 ...Now, she is tucked into a favorite chair in the sunroom at the vice
president's residence, a home she will inhabit for 15 more months. The room
-- which she redecorated, like much of the residence, to remind her of
Wyoming -- is done in neutral tones, with a framed map of the Cheneys' home
state on the wall and a sculpture of an elk on a table. (In the adjacent
library, there is a buffalo sculpture under a table; there is also an entire
shelf of fishing books, including two intimidatingly large tomes titled
"Trout, Volume I" and "Trout, Volume II.")...

 Not to be uppity or easy, but it does not look like modernism, or
post-modernism in either art or books has ever crossed the Vice-President's
threshold of awareness! What's there appears pure 19th century. I would be
surprised if there were not multi-point buck antlers over the fire place.
The site would appear to be a rich point of departure for, at least, theater
or an installation work in which the 21st century would be im/exploding
about the edges (Photographs of  Blackwater contractors blazing away in
Baghda humvees, trophy Al-Queda captives being tortured in the basement,
etc.), while Vice-President's wife continues to  rhapsodize about the joys
of dating in 1958 in her junior year in the Veep's convertible in downtown
Caspar, Wyoming.
 To quote Marianne Moore in the Steeplejack:
          ...it is a privilege to see so
 much confusion...

 Tomorrow Iran?

Thanks to whoever?it was who posted the actual Simic article....I've already lost my place in my emails but thanks!....turns out to just be the usual "de gustibus" and certainly no "hatchet job"....who was it who explained homosexuality to their young niece: "for people who like those sorts of things, that is the sort of thing they like"....Simic's interpretation of the apothegm "no ideas but in things" seems to fall on the near side of the idea that words?ARE things, and would probably not enjoy the play Creeley enacted with the impossible tennis game between "here" and "there," to give one notable instance....

Mr. Simic is all too eager to nail shut the coffin on the "New
Americans" and their mystifying poetics. That is the tone of the piece
and seeming objective. Given that he's the new poet laureate, this
gesture seems a tad more ungracious than if he were still a "private
citizen." --Maxine Chernoff

Simic, for goodness sake, is not promoting "nicely observed details and memorable stories," he's being totally condescending to them--but he's saying that Creeley is even worse than that!

  The Simic review could have been written in, what, 1965? It's right
out of the grand tradition poetry wars, academics vs. New Americans,
etc, etc--is this your point, Mark? The fact seems grimly obvious to
me....I was surprised that Simic didn't both taking a passing shot
at, say, "so-called 'language' poetry" or something of that sort.

I agree with you entirely (and thus disagree with Joshua) that,
however plausable the account of Creeley's post-1970 work Simic
offers, the poetics on which such an account is grounded is one that
would reject a great deal of work besides that of the later Creeley:

"American poetry is full of daybooks, poets who report everything
they see and think and who keep doing the same thing for years, but
they usually pay better attention to what goes on around them than he
does, filling their poems with nicely observed details and memorable
stories. "

"Nicely observed details and memorable stories," eh? This is not
exactly in the great Romantic tradition of strong claims for poetry;
though it may be in the tradition of the most mediocre professional
instruction of creative writing.....

i don't think she understands what they are, or she wouldn't say such

Yup, that's a big piece of it. Thanks, Nick--I was beginning to think
nobody else knew how to read the fine print.

It's really not a matter of whether Simic likes any of Creeley's
work--de gustibus non disputandem est, and all that--it's the terms
of his argument.

The poetry wars have never ended, although a few more poets attempt
to straddle the line than used to. The kind who become poet laureate
are usually content simply to ignore us.

I know from friends how the system works at NYRB, by the way. Simic
wasn't assigned the task, he chose it. He could equally have chosen
to remain silent.

My guess (though of course I'm happy to be corrected) is that what
Mark was referring to was this bit, from the last paragraph:

"[Creeley] continued to believe that some bit of language that came
out of the blue could be a poem, while in fact the more conventional
lyrics and longer narrative poems that required additional tinkering
served him better. It's a pity that he felt the need to remain
faithful to ideas about composition long after it became clear that
they not only were limiting him but were a dead end."

For me, anyway, that was the dumbest part of the review=97it's just flat
wrong=97and if that is what Mark's objecting to, then count me right
there with him.

But what interested me was that several of the responses to the
review, even more than the review itself, could have been written in
1965. How quickly everyone jumped into the old trenches on the first
word of an attack by *one of them* against *one of us*!

I hope it's not too flippant to say that a lot has changed since 1965
(or 1985, for that matter). In this particular case, what's changed
most is that Creeley is recognized far and wide as one of the most
important American poets of the second half of the twentieth century.
Does that mean that everything he wrote had to be gold? Of course not.
But does anyone think that even Simic would dispute that importance? I
didn't get any sense of that from the review, but maybe some hear more
sneering than I do in the line, "There was a time when Robert Creeley
was a cult figure, a poet nearly as famous as Allen Ginsberg and
Robert Lowell."

The last time Creeley was reviewed in the NYRB, for _Words_ in 1968,
John Thompson could hardly gasp through his condescension (E.g. "This
mood has always had an appeal for certain kinds of gentle
adolescents".) Simic at least treats Creeley as a peer=97heresy, I know,
for some on this list, but is that really so unfair? Simic isn't
exactly a johnny-come-lately.

That said, the point that seemed worth making was that Creeley's
legacy as a teacher, hero, and friend to so many have helped to make
him a kind of critical untouchable (in the Eliot Ness sense of the
word). I understand that impulse, especially as I expect there are
many people who still mourn his loss and who consider that this
conversation is happening much too soon. But I do think it's worth
acknowledging, since there are also many of us who only know Creeley
through his work. And there are at least a few of us who have not been
able to reckon his importance=97the obvious impact he's had on so much
of contemporary poetry=97on the sole basis of that work. I still can't
tell whether that seems obvious or obviously wrong to the people who
have responded so far, but that's where I'm coming from.

Hi all ---

And some of these responses --- not out of the poetry wars?

I think the most offensive thing about Simic's review was that it was
a piece of occasional journalism --- that it took an important poet,
an important life and treated it fairly straightforwardly, without
the usual (and perhaps deserved) mythologizing.  Just a critique of
Creeley's career --- with no real eye to its symbolic importance to
"a great deal of work besides."

It was, you have to admit, better than seeing Leithauser write on
MacNeice.

But, by all means, expose the grand ideological implications of the
review.

+ + + +

That link, by the way, was to a note by (my colleague) Robert P.
Baird, not me.  I generally agree with his report, though.

The Simic review could have been written in, what, 1965? It's right
out of the grand tradition poetry wars, academics vs. New Americans,
etc, etc--is this your point, Mark? The fact seems grimly obvious to
me....I was surprised that Simic didn't both taking a passing shot
at, say, "so-called 'language' poetry" or something of that sort.

I agree with you entirely (and thus disagree with Joshua) that,
however plausable the account of Creeley's post-1970 work Simic
offers, the poetics on which such an account is grounded is one that
would reject a great deal of work besides that of the later Creeley:

"American poetry is full of daybooks, poets who report everything
they see and think and who keep doing the same thing for years, but
they usually pay better attention to what goes on around them than he
does, filling their poems with nicely observed details and memorable
stories. "

"Nicely observed details and memorable stories," eh? This is not
exactly in the great Romantic tradition of strong claims for poetry;
though it may be in the tradition of the most mediocre professional
instruction of creative writing.....

I have to disagree, Barry:  Simic's prose in the essay is full of
just such banalities offered as praise.  & besides, whenever he
praises later Creeley it's for writing a poem that demonstrates a
"good eye", for a lyric in the imagist tradition.....

Dear Alex:

While it is true there are is much mythology and speculation surrounding Vi=
llon's life and work, ironically because of his criminal record, there exis=
t quite a few documents of his passage on the Parisian section of the Earth=
.  The steady work of generations of scholars and sundry other Villonophile=
s has unearthed a great deal of information on many of the persons mentione=
d in Villon's poetry, many dates have been able to be established with some=
 certainty, and ever more steps forth as distincty as did Harry Lime in The=
 Third Man from the shadowy alleys of medieval Paris and the labyrinths of =
the underworld's vast network, of which Villon was a part.   Continued rese=
arches into the Jargon Villon employed so often have continued to turn up t=
he hitherto covert meanings of a word here and there, illuminating some pre=
viously gargoylishly fiercely guarded reference
      (Michelle Bernstein, Guy Debord's first wife, and/or he the first of =
her husbands,  has written a very interesting book on the Jargon, for examp=
le.)

     As an example of the mythologizing and speculation of a poet's life,  =
extended not only to the departed, but even the recently departed, and to t=
he living as well, do we not have here on this list the very occurence of t=
his in the debates about the Simic review of Creeley?  Or in the pages of t=
he "Collective Autobiography" of The Grand Piano?

    And mythologies and speculations are not set in stone, but extremely mu=
table.  If one reads the criticism and biographies of  many poets as they a=
re produced through time, one may note what an immense struggle there is al=
ways over the "interpretation" of even the largest most undeniable collecti=
ons of facts about a poet's life and works.  How often do the blurbs not an=
nounce the latest bio, translation, book of criticism as "the definitive wo=
rk on the subject," "the latest and best word," the "unearthing of a comple=
tely unknown side of the artist"--as either a Saint-in-the-making, or the D=
evil in Disguise? And then within months or a few years, the further discov=
ery of yet more documents, and the subsequent appearance of yet more interp=
retations, yet more fabrications, willfully slanted ideological readings or=
 canon-reformatting blockbusters and the like?  "So-and-so is now returned =
to her rightful place on the most honored of shelves of our literature . . =
. " and "somebody-or-other has at last found his final comeuppance, and bee=
n relegated once and for all to the bottom of the literary barrel, there to=
 swim among the larvae of gnits . . .  where he and his demolished prosody =
so richly deserve to drown. "

Rimbaud, to cite an another example of a poet with a  short life and relati=
vely small body of work, continues to generate an incredible amount of biog=
raphical studies, interpretations, re-evaluations in terms of the current f=
avored projected image of him by one person or group, as well as on whateve=
r are the most recently unearthed scraps and bits of evidence. =20

The enduring legacy of Villon is his work, itself so filled with documentat=
ions clear or obscured by the Jargon and "les neiges d'antan."  Yet there c=
ontinues to be coming to light ever more documentation from outside sources=
 of the actuality of his life and of the Paris of the time period.

Poets both leaves traces like snails through the world, and create mytholgi=
es all on their own out of both the slime and sublime of their real & imagi=
ned lives.  After a certain point the "demythologizing" of a poet's life (a=
nd work)--can turn into a mythology of its own, with the "faith" in it depe=
ndent on the convincingness of the argument, of the biographer/critic-mytho=
logizer, and the manner of arranging, erasing, adding to  "the facts of the=
 case."

I've been reading Felix Feneon's Three Line Novels as it is called in the A=
merican edition (NYRB) of this year.  These are the "fait divers" snippets =
he produced anonymously for the mass circulation paper Le Matin for half a =
year in Paris in 1906.  (At the same time he was contributing to various An=
archist journals and papers under a variety of pseudonyms.  One paper, spea=
king of Jargon, was written entirely by using only  the working class slang=
 of its intended audience.) This stunning collection of astonishing writing=
 exists today only because Feneon's mistress of fifty years kept a scrapbok=
 of his writings, under whatever name or non-name they appeared.  The book'=
s excellent introduction by Luc Sante discusses some of the myths which aro=
se around Feneon due in part to his desire to "work at a distance" as edito=
r, translator, anonymous and pseudonymous hyper-author.=20

Mythologies tend to grow up around the poet's head, whether they be laurels=
 or weeds.  The production of the "author function" is not as clear cut a c=
onstruct as the "death of the author" would have one presume. The "scene of=
 the author" so to speak, is a far more contaminated and complicated  "scen=
e of the crime" (fittingly, for Villon!) than one might be willing to allow=
. Works like Spicer's After Lorca and the Yasusada texts point to this, wit=
h their fictitious letters, poems, translations, journal entries, foot note=
s, introductions, messages from the "Outside" of the factually and fictiona=
lly dead, from ghosts, and from the uses of hoaxes, plagiarisms, imitations=
, and their own forms of embedded and embodied "literary criticisms & theor=
ies."

Mythologies, so to speak, engender de-mythologies which in turn create new =
mythologies, while all the while continues the Anarkeyological work of exca=
vating the facts & texts  from the rubbish heaps of history, where texts by=
 Sappho blow in the winds of Egyptian dumpheaps, inscribed on papyrus used =
in the wrapping of fourth rate mummies, unraveling and revealing  . . . the=
 words of Sappho, known to the Ancients as The Eighth Wonder of the World .=
 . .=20

as James Joyce'd say, "history as her is harped."

As for Villon's irony and paradoxes, with a great deal of it, the sort of s=
pecificity you mention isn't needed at all to understand what he is present=
ing: (note these are Galway Kinell's translations--used here since easy to =
find in the bi-lingual edition from New England Press; if you can, read the=
 original French--the force of the sounds is fantastic-)

LOL..Amen, brother! it's great to see the fervor is about as equal to the
devotees of the cult of Mithras but I expected to see a full evisceration in
text with all the build-up on here...maybe we should distribute some chill pills
 or some other legal mellowing substance and all listen to Pink Floyd singing
"Us  us us us us us and Them them them them them..."  and as to  miracles...I
heard that a copy of Pieces somewhere out in Texas began to  bleed
spontaneously as soon as the first copy of the Simic article went through  the presses,
but have yet to see corroboration...I hear Scully and Muldauer are  hot on the
trail.....

Perhaps not in this case. but it is dangerous to assume that =B3one review=B2
cannot undo a lifetime=B9s brilliant work. It often has. At least for a few
hundred years.

As does the blas=E9 attitude exemplified in your letter. =B3Relax, it=B9s not
going to hurt anything=B2 is a kind of background poison running thru our
time. (Is the implication =B3it=B9s only poetry=B2 lurking here?)

As I think I've made plain, I think this outrage is misplaced. But consider, aside from whatever symbolic importance one might accord to his Poet Laureateship (in my mind, zero) there is the rather more pragmatic significance of the fact that, since 2004 and through next year, if anyone on this list is applying for a Guggenheim Fellowship--a nice piece of change--he will be the one deciding that you don't deserve it.

Dear Folks,=20

I think what=B9s wrong is the snide, uptight tone which stinks of sour grapes=
.
And what I find most suspect in Simic=B9s piece is the opening attack on the
publication of large books of collected poems on principle. Mr. Simic=B9s
statement that he himself could not read a thousand pages of poetry by one
person unless he was imprisoned for life, make me wonder what he does with
his time, and how seriously he takes the work of the poem at all. Reading
everything, or everything you can get your hands on, by a great poet is the
preface, the foreplay if you will, before getting down to any serious study
of her/him.

In a class I once sat in on somewhere, Creeley (who was reading Joshua
Slocum at the time) talked about what for him constituted good
criticism=8Bthat the essay or book should be the record of a journey through =
a
work, or through all a (wo)man=B9s works.

One of the main points that seems to rankle for Mr. Simic has been much
iterated by Creeley, and many other poets, artists, musicians, etc., of his
time (and mine): that (past a certain point in learning the craft) you are
free to take the poem as it comes, let it dictate its own form and intent,
with very little=8Bif any=8Brevision. It seems that for Charles Simic that
amount of labor that goes into a poem, the amount the poor piece is
BE-labored, the more he can take it seriously as =B3Art=B2. I am not sure why
the idea of spontaneous creation--taking dictation (Spicer), obedience to
the poem (Duncan) etc. etc.--is so threatening to certain writers and
critic, but it is.=20

In the course of this one essay Mr. Simic deliberately(?) cites and
misunderstands at least two statements by Robert Creeley (not surprising,
since he apparently often misreads the poems as well).

Creeley is quoted as saying: =B3Poetry seems to be written momently=8Bthat is,
it occupies a moment of time. . . . I seem to be given to work in some
intense moment of whatever possibility, and if I manage to gain the
articula-tion (sic) necessary in that moment, then happily there is the
poem.=B2=20

This leads Simic to  assume that =B3all we can except. . . will be jottings,
words and phrases about his state of mind which will rely on his knack for
colloquial speech to conceal the paucity of content.=B2  BUT:

Momently =8B harks back to =B3momentous=B2 in my ear, and I would be willing to
bet in Creeley=B9s. It=B9s a moment, yes, but a momentous moment if you will, a
charged moment many of us have experienced. The paradox is that it=B9s in tim=
e
and =B3out of time=B2 (H.D.=B9 phrase) at the same time. In the same way =B3happily=
=B2
sounds its root=8Bhappy involves chance, fortuitous chance=8Bthus the poem
arrives in the moment IF the poet has =B3gained the articulation=B2. You gain i=
t
by many hours, many years of paying attention to craft, but not by applying
craft as a sledge hammer to the whatever possiblity stands in the Moment.

It may be that Mr. Simic lacks the language skills to read Creeley=8Band
perhaps many other American poets. It is hard=8Balmost impossible--to hear al=
l
the layerings of meaning in any but your native tongue.

There=B9s still more to be said about this quotation and its misreading. And
pages to write about Simic=B9s misunderstanding a bit further on in his piece
where he sneeringly dismisses the advice Creeley quotes as having come to
him at different times from Ginsberg and from Duncan.

But enough for now. Toward the end of his =B3review=B2 Mr. Simic has occasion t=
o
refer to Robert Creeley=B9s views as =B3reductive=B2. I fear the habitual
reductivism he should look to is his own.

While it seems incontrovertible that Creeley is immeasurably more of a poet
than Simic, greater poets than Creeley have fallen off mightily from their
early attainments--think of Whitman after 1865 (and look at how much fatter
the "deathbed edition" of Leaves of Grass is than the 1865 edition, let
alone the 1855 one). And have you perused Wordsworth's Sonnets on the
Punishment of Death any time recently? Well, neither have I, but they ain't
no Tintern Abbey, I'll tell you that. What's wrong with pointing such thing=
s
out, if a critic finds them to be the case?

David:

I'm a bit puzzled by a couple of things you say.

<<
Continued researches into the Jargon Villon employed so often have continued
to turn up the hitherto covert meanings of a word here and there,
illuminating some previously gargoylishly fiercely guarded reference
>>

The Poems in Jargon (cant would be a better term in English) are a very
small part of Villon's work.  While cant terms do occur in _The Testament_,
even the most extreme case there, the ballade "De bonne doctrine a ceux de
mauvaise vie," isn't even close to the relatively impenetrable language of
the argot poems.

<<
(Michelle Bernstein, Guy Debord's first wife, and/or he the first of her
husbands,  has written a very interesting book on the Jargon, for example.)
>>

Are you confusing Michelle Bernstein with Alice Becker-Ho, Debord's widow
(second wife?)?   Becker-Ho wrote _The Princes of Jargon_ about the Romani
origins of all varieties of European cant, not simply French argot, and
certainly not insofar as I've read in it, with much specific reference to
Villon.

Given Diane's most recent post to the list, i'm of the opinion that she
ought to. It perfectly outlines everything that is wrong with the Simic
piece.

'Howl' too hot to hear
50 years after poem ruled not obscene, radio fears to air it

Wednesday, October 3, 2007
Lawrence Ferlinghetti first published "Howl." He sees FCC... Attorney
Jake Ehrlich (left) defended "Howl" publisher La...

Fifty years ago today, a San Francisco Municipal Court judge ruled
that Allen Ginsberg's Beat-era poem "Howl" was not obscene. Yet
today, a New York public broadcasting station decided not to air the
poem, fearing that the Federal Communications Commission will find it
indecent and crush the network with crippling fines.

Free-speech advocates see tremendous irony in how Ginsberg's epic
poem - which lambastes the consumerism and conformism of the 1950s
and heralds a budding American counterculture - is, half a century
later, chilled by a federal government crackdown on the broadcasting
of provocative language.

In the new media landscape, the "Howl" controversy illustrates how
indecency standards differ on the Internet and on the public
airwaves. Instead of broadcasting the poem on the air today, New York
listener-supported radio station WBAI will include a reading of the
poem in a special online-only program called "Howl Against
Censorship." It will be posted on www.pacifica.org, the Internet home
of the Berkeley-based Pacifica Foundation, because online sites do
not fall under the FCC's purview.

"Why, 50 years later after a judge ruled that children could read
this poem, people are afraid the courts will say that their ears
shouldn't hear it," said Ron Collins, a constitutional law instructor
and First Amendment advocate who is leading a small group of authors,
broadcasters and free-speech advocates pushing to broadcast the poem
eventually. "Yet they can go on the Internet and see far, far worse
things."

Another irony: WBAI, the Pacifica Foundation station in New York that
plans to post "Howl" online, is the same station that took on the FCC
more than 30 years ago over the right to air George Carlin's comedy
routine featuring the "seven dirty words." The challenge led to a
1978 Supreme Court decision governing what naughty words can be
broadcast and when.

Pacifica's attorney for FCC issues, John Crigler, thinks airing
"Howl" would be "a great test case" in the current environment. But
he understands why WBAI won't broadcast "Howl," even between the
hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., the hours the FCC has cordoned off for
rougher language.

WBAI program director Bernard White fears that the FCC will fine the
station $325,000 for every one of Ginsberg's dirty-word bombs. If
each Pacifica station that aired the poem - and possibly repeated it
- were to be fined for airing "Howl," it could mean millions of
dollars in fines.

The potential impact of such penalties is daunting to a commercial-
free station with a $4 million annual budget whose financial state
White described as "in the black, but we're surrounded by a lot of
red ink. A fine like that might crush us."

Interim Pacifica Foundation executive director Dan Siegel said, "And
I think they're being optimistic with that financial assessment."
Siegel said each Pacifica station is free to air the program if it
wishes, but he didn't know if any planned to.

But with a budget of $18 million for all of its five stations, Siegel
said, "it might make more sense for CBS or someone like them to take
on a risk like this."

So the poem that begins "I saw the best minds of my generation
destroyed by madness" finds itself an odd bedfellow in the battle
against the FCC with entertainers like Nicole Richie and Cher, both
of whom were deemed to cross the FCC's dirty-words line that free-
speech advocates say is constantly shifting.

Last month, several public broadcasting outlets - including San
Francisco's KQED - broadcast "clean" versions of Ken Burns' World War
II documentary "The War" because they feared the FCC would punish
them for airing four four-letter words that turn up over the course
of the visually graphic 14-hour documentary about the brutality of war.

At last month's Emmy Awards broadcast, the Fox network censored three
instances in which performers said words that the network felt could
land it an FCC fine. One involved comedian Ray Romano using the word
"screwing." In another instance, a performer mouthed, but didn't say,
a four-letter word. The third was actress Sally Field using the word
"goddamn" to describe her opposition to the war in Iraq.

Free-speech advocates and broadcasters say uncertainty about
appropriateness is rooted in two recent cases that are wending their
way through the court system.

Last month, attorneys for CBS asked a federal appeals court to
overturn a $550,000 fine the FCC imposed for airing singer Janet
Jackson's exposed breast during her infamous "wardrobe malfunction"
in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show. The FCC said that even though
the exposure lasted only 9/16th of a second, CBS failed to exercise
proper control of its "employees" - Jackson and halftime show co-star
Justin Timberlake.

In June, the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York ruled
that the FCC acted "arbitrarily and capriciously" when it planned to
penalize Fox for "fleeting expletives" uttered by Cher and Richie at
the Billboard Music awards shows in 2002 and 2003 respectively. The
network's attorneys said the FCC hadn't punished such "fleeting
expletives" since the 1978 Pacifica case involving WBAI and Carlin's
seven dirty words.

But while Pacifica's Crigler said "Howl" would be a good test case
for this new landscape, University of Virginia law professor and
former FCC Commissioner Glen O. Robinson said "it is best to let the
other cases go through the system first."

"Maybe the commission would look differently on it if we were talking
about Shakespeare, but Ginsberg isn't Shakespeare," he said.

But in an era in which a bottomless well of profanity and pornography
is available online, why should it matter that "Howl" can't be
broadcast on the radio? Finding "Howl" is a quick online search away
for anyone old enough to access a computer.

"But you still have to have a computer," said Janet Coleman, arts
director at WBAI, who is airing a program Wednesday about "Howl" with
San Francisco's iconic poet and City Lights Books owner Lawrence
Ferlinghetti and others. Like other station employees, she feels
frustrated by the current atmosphere.

"This is about the public airwaves. If we can't control what goes on
them, then how much freedom do we really have?" she said.

The power of Ginsberg's poem isn't lost on Ferlinghetti, who faced
jail time and a fine 50 years ago for publishing "Howl." In August,
Ferlinghetti joined Collins' group of free-speech advocates, writers
and attorneys in asking WBAI to air the poem.

In an interview to be broadcast today on WBAI to commemorate the 50th
anniversary of the poem's legal victory, Ferlinghetti was asked what
Ginsberg, who died in 1997, would have said about the broadcast
controversy.

"Ah, well, I'm sure he'd have plenty to say about it. I often lament
that he isn't around to say it," Ferlinghetti told WBAI.

"As Allen Ginsberg's original publisher and editor, for most of his
life, I look at the present situation as a repeat in spades of what
happened in the 1950s, which was also a repressive period," he said.
"The current FCC policy wasn't conceived just for poetry, but when
applied to the case of Allen Ginsberg's poem 'Howl,' it amounts to
government censorship of an important critique of modern
civilization, especially of America and its consumerist society,
whose breath is money, still.

"It's such a hypocritical concept of American culture in which
children are regularly exposed to adult programming in the mass
media, with subjects ranging from sexual to criminal to state-
sponsored terrorism, while at the same time they are not allowed to
hear poetry far less explicit," Ferlinghetti said. "I suggest the FCC
ban all television newscasts until after 10 p.m., when children won't
be listening."

Actually, I should qualify that a little, as it looks as if I'm denying any
cant element in the language of _The Testament_.  Not so.  But the cant
aspect tends to be a slight overlay, certainly in contrast to the poems in
argot proper..

Take line 1510 of _The Testament_ -- "Pour retraire ses villotieres" --
translated by Barbara Sargent-Baur as "To redeem those girls who run
around," while the Rychner and Henry notes gloss:  "VILLOTIERES:  'femmes
coureuses, de mauvaise vie."

This suggests what we might today call streetwalkers, but in the sixteenth
century in England would have been called by a variety of names. There were
various terms for female vagabonds available then, such a "doxy" or "dell",
each pointing to a specific place in the vagabond organisation, and the
closest approximation to a "villotiere" would have been a "walking mort".
The idea of walking around was much more powerful (and subversive) in
fifteenth century France and sixteenth century England than today, and much
more closely associated with organised vagabond societies, so the
translation and glosses above probably underestimate the degree to which the
word "villotiere", as used by Villon, would have had a reference to a
professional female vagabond of a specific kind.

First of all, THIS Simic/Creeley discussion is the kind of content I hope t=
o get from this list, so thank you Mark Weiss.=0A=0ASecond, we are fortunat=
e to have Diane di Prima in on this discussion as fewer of the original New=
 American Poets are alive these days and fewer still are active on lists li=
ke these, so I am grateful for that.=0A=0AIn my study of Open Form, which a=
t one time Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov called Organic (a term I prefe=
r to use, see http://www.OrganicPoetry.org) I became convinced that the clo=
sed, (non-organic) IS aligned with a reductive cosmology. (Competition, dom=
ination and the illusion of control are hallmarks of THAT paradigm.)=0A=0AD=
iane said two things I want to zero in on: =0A=0A1) "I am not sure why the =
idea of spontaneous creation--taking dictation (Spicer), obedience to the p=
oem (Duncan) etc. etc.--is so threatening to certain writers and=0Acritic, =
but it is." =0A=0ATo begin to take a shot at answering Diane's question, I'=
ll quote Denise Levertov, who said: =0A=0A"Incidentally, I think the at a p=
art of the poet's equipment is the instinct for knowing when to 'begin' wri=
ting a poem. A poem which is begun to be put on paper, to be crystallized, =
too soon, is going to be a poem which, if the poet has a sense of responsib=
ility, is going to need an awful lot of revision. This can be avoided by wa=
iting until the moment is ripe. Once he has crystallized, initially, the po=
em, then comes the responsibility of his intelligence and his judgment."=0A=
  =0AThe poet who can train herself to recognize and seize the moment is wh=
at we're speaking of here,  which is part of why I designed the August Poet=
ry Postcard Fest (http://www.PoetryPostcards.blogspot.com), so that after a=
 month of writing spontaneously right on a postcard, by August 31st each pa=
rticipant would have a better sense of how the poem begins to well up in on=
e's consciousness. There were some participants who were FRIGHTENED of writ=
ing right onto the postcard, but each gets to their end in the best way the=
y know how.=0A=0AI think with folks who don't understand the organic gestur=
e, the impediment is FEAR. They see this stance-toward-poem-making as reckl=
ess, and feel they need a greater degree of control via constant revision, =
but much of the poetry of the closed school I find gutless and the "mistake=
s" the editor's mind would often seek to eradicate may be the finest parts =
of a poem. Eileen Myles discussed this to me in an interview I conducted ye=
ars ago and a soundbite specific to this aspect of the organic is here: htt=
p://splab.org/poets/EileenMyles-onMilk.mp3 You may want to hear the poem sh=
e refers to, linked here: http://splab.org/poets/EileenMyles-Milk-poem.mp3=
=0A=0ARon Silliman's use of the "School of Quietude" moniker to describe cl=
osed poetry resonates with me. Quiet and frightened. Sin duende.=0A=0ADiane=

 to refer to Robert Creeley=B9s views as =B3reductive=B2. I fear the habitu=
al reductivism he should look to is his own."=0A=0AShahar Bram's excellent =
book "Charles Olson and Alfred North Whitehead: An Essay on Poetry," as wel=
l as Robin Blaser's essay "The Violets" both illustrate the importance of W=
hitehead as a source for Olson. Whitehead's process cosmology (Philosophy o=
f Organism) must be very frightening to individuals predisposed to a reduct=
ionist view of the universe, yet it is quite evident to anyone paying atten=
tion that the reductionist view is endangering more than just poetry on thi=
s planet. =0A=0AOlson created some of his most important works in dialog wi=
th Creeley. Creeley's place in poetry is secure despite the efforts of peop=
le like Mr. Simic. I just wish I would have waited two more days instead of=
 dropping three bucks to read the piece.=0A=0APaul Nelson=0A=0A =0APaul E. =

As I  think I've made plain, I think this outrage is misplaced. But consider,
aside  from whatever symbolic importance one might accord to his Poet
Laureateship  (in my mind, zero) there is the rather more pragmatic significance of
the fact  that, since 2004 and through next year, if anyone on this list is
applying for  a Guggenheim Fellowship--a nice piece of change--he will be the one
deciding  that you don't deserve it.



I was not someone who knew Creeley personally, though I saw him read to a
large audience; I found his Collected at a picked-over public library and sat
right down on the floor and started to read it and felt it to be a great  book.
 I didn't know he wasn't well-liked by some -- I thought he seemed  like a
kind fellow up at that podium.  I liked the Simic review.  I  thought it was
acerbic, perhaps a little like Creeley, too?  Isn't the  review's tone about the
heave of poetry itself, about its weight in tomes, about  the work (or power
over the dead) of deciding whose real work survives.   This group seems to be
saying Creeley will survive the next decades in courses  & libraries, perhaps
longer.  I write poems sporadically, not for  grants (and may never), but b.
makes another due point here.   AMB

Well, yes, except the bit about needing to be a native speaker to understand him rankles a bit, honestly.

I think what¹s wrong is the snide, uptight tone which stinks of sour grapes.
And what I find most suspect in Simic¹s piece is the opening attack on the
publication of large books of collected poems on principle. Mr. Simic¹s
statement that he himself could not read a thousand pages of poetry by one
person unless he was imprisoned for life, make me wonder what he does with
his time, and how seriously he takes the work of the poem at all. Reading
everything, or everything you can get your hands on, by a great poet is the
preface, the foreplay if you will, before getting down to any serious study
of her/him.

In a class I once sat in on somewhere, Creeley (who was reading Joshua
Slocum at the time) talked about what for him constituted good
criticism‹that the essay or book should be the record of a journey through a
work, or through all a (wo)man¹s works.

One of the main points that seems to rankle for Mr. Simic has been much
iterated by Creeley, and many other poets, artists, musicians, etc., of his
time (and mine): that (past a certain point in learning the craft) you are
free to take the poem as it comes, let it dictate its own form and intent,
with very little‹if any‹revision. It seems that for Charles Simic that
amount of labor that goes into a poem, the amount the poor piece is
BE-labored, the more he can take it seriously as ³Art². I am not sure why
the idea of spontaneous creation--taking dictation (Spicer), obedience to
the poem (Duncan) etc. etc.--is so threatening to certain writers and
critic, but it is.

In the course of this one essay Mr. Simic deliberately(?) cites and
misunderstands at least two statements by Robert Creeley (not surprising,
since he apparently often misreads the poems as well).

Creeley is quoted as saying: ³Poetry seems to be written momently‹that is,
it occupies a moment of time. . . . I seem to be given to work in some
intense moment of whatever possibility, and if I manage to gain the
articula-tion (sic) necessary in that moment, then happily there is the
poem.²

This leads Simic to  assume that ³all we can except. . . will be jottings,
words and phrases about his state of mind which will rely on his knack for
colloquial speech to conceal the paucity of content.²  BUT:

Momently ‹ harks back to ³momentous² in my ear, and I would be willing to
bet in Creeley¹s. It¹s a moment, yes, but a momentous moment if you will, a
charged moment many of us have experienced. The paradox is that it¹s in time
and ³out of time² (H.D.¹ phrase) at the same time. In the same way ³happily²
sounds its root‹happy involves chance, fortuitous chance‹thus the poem
arrives in the moment IF the poet has ³gained the articulation². You gain it
by many hours, many years of paying attention to craft, but not by applying
craft as a sledge hammer to the whatever possiblity stands in the Moment.

It may be that Mr. Simic lacks the language skills to read Creeley‹and
perhaps many other American poets. It is hard‹almost impossible--to hear all
the layerings of meaning in any but your native tongue.

There¹s still more to be said about this quotation and its misreading. And
pages to write about Simic¹s misunderstanding a bit further on in his piece
where he sneeringly dismisses the advice Creeley quotes as having come to
him at different times from Ginsberg and from Duncan.

But enough for now. Toward the end of his ³review² Mr. Simic has occasion to
refer to Robert Creeley¹s views as ³reductive². I fear the habitual
reductivism he should look to is his own.

While it seems incontrovertible that Creeley is immeasurably more of a poet
than Simic, greater poets than Creeley have fallen off mightily from their
early attainments--think of Whitman after 1865 (and look at how much fatter
the "deathbed edition" of Leaves of Grass is than the 1865 edition, let
alone the 1855 one). And have you perused Wordsworth's Sonnets on the
Punishment of Death any time recently? Well, neither have I, but they ain't
no Tintern Abbey, I'll tell you that. What's wrong with pointing such things
out, if a critic finds them to be the case?

If it means something, and I'm just one of many able
to learn from Bob, and these comments are bit more
thoughtful than my former ones, but Bob was certainly
concerned about how well his work might "hold up". We
once discussed it, in fact, and I even wrote a poem
about it, for him. However sensible our motivations,
many of us, quite frankly, are really very hesitant,
for fear, perhaps, that our vision "of the world"
might not be found valid.

It's a strange thing to devote oneself to the task of
sharing one's life with so many, and most of whom Bob
would never meet. In the end, I suppose that what is
wonderful about Simic's piece, having digested posts
and sense of loss these last few days, is that
Creeley's work is supposed be tested - examined more
critically, and, yes, even by "foes". With the turmoil
of myth-building days no longer a possibility, this
criticism is something for which he would have,
because he was no slouch, I think, be happy about.

He did spend so many years waiting for this moment,
knowing that this is what it is all about, and
choosing the tempo. In the end, his voice and vision
is what's to be examined.

Thanks, Robin, David C. et al, for the 'Villonious' imput. I, also, find this disucussion fascinating.
 I wonder if a 'walking mort' - and this may be too obvious or facile - is what we call, 'a dead man walking' - as in, 'he won't be on the streets for long'.
 Also fascinating to read about the risks and subversive nature of walking in  the 15th Century. Ironically, walking, particularly if you are a stranger, is very suspect behavior in 'gated' and many suburban 'communities.'.  Or, say, have you ever noticed that are no sidewalks (or walking trails) in the grounds between hotels, etc. in the land around Disney World. (I was stuck at a convention there once). Another place where they want to control all behavior.
 Well, let's not even get into the pervasivness of  surveillance cameras in malls, City Streets, etc.  "God's Eye"  has many little  industries  profiting from technologies designed to order and control any 'outlaw' pedestrian behavior.

 Instead of 'lame duck' I suspect there are some who refer to George Bush as a 'walking mort.'    Ironically, in terms of those confined to live behind walls, Lyn Cheney - when asked what she wanted most - said she said would just like to be able to walk into a bookstore and get a book.  Unfortunately, in the last six years, since she and Dick got sequstered, the number of Independent Bookstores that you can find on the Street has been radically reduced. It does not seem right that a would-be Villon - going back to Robin's point - can no longer find a store with the poet's books. In my experience, "Strolling" in front of a 'personal' computer monitor for goods, books included, is no equal to the visual pleasures - real people included -  on a good street.

There's a long definition in Thomas Harman's _Caveat for Common Cursitors_
of 1567.

More briefly, in the 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (technically, the
fourth of five editions of Grose's _Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue_):

    STROLLERS. Itinerants of different kinds. Strolling morts;
    beggars or pedlars pretending to be widows.

http://www.free-ebooks.net/ebook/ebooks/ebooks%20for%20site/tutorials/misc-tutorial/1811%20Dictionary%20of%20the%20Vulgar%20Tongue.pdf

"Mort", along with a whole slew of other cant terms -- dell, doxy, Upright
Man, darkmans, prigging a prancer, etc -- appears in English in the early
part of the sixteenth century.  Cant (strictly, a special language used by
thieves and vagabonds for concealment, as opposed to [the English Terms]
slang and jargon, and parallel to the French "argot") appears in Europe in
the late fifteenth century -- Rotwelsh in Germany, Coquilard (I think) in
France, which was what Villon wrote his poems in argot in, and first called
"peddler's French" in England (in Robert Copland's wildly under-rated _Hye
Way to the Spitall Hous_ in 1530) -- probably as a result of the arrival of
the Romani in Europe.

There's more -- I'm currently working on an attempt to show that the terms
"rogue", "whipjack" and "jarkman" are an unintended consequence of the
passage of the Act Against Vagabonds in 1530.  That act demanded that
beggars, both impotent and sturdy, must have passports (licences and seals),
and promptly created a new industry in the production of forged passports
(by jarkmen).

This as a small part of a larger study of the term "blowen", which takes
over from "mort" around the end of the eighteenth century in both England
and America.

Stuff like that.

*Alias Pail
www.aliaspail.com
=20
Alias Pail are scatterbrain musicians and good friends. Friendship through
sound and curiosity. Sometimes Alias Pail feels like playing fractured
amateur pop songs: inherited by =B980s twee bands and nonmusical underground
Japanese counterparts like Tenniscoats and Maher Shalal Hash Baz.
=20
Other times, Alias Pail enjoys using circuit bent instruments in their set
to arrive at new sounds and speaker fry. They design and develop their own
circuit bent instruments and headlined the final night of the New York City
Bent Festival. Alias Pail also enjoys ambient works of Brian Eno and noise
and tribal experimental smash up sounds like OOIOO or DNA, fuzzy
atmospherics; anything that falls in their lap. They like every song to be
its own band.  Their sets can adapt from experimental to electronic to pop.
Modular approach for music making.

*Daouets
www.myspace.com/daouets
=20
Daouets is a mini-supergroup devised by three musicians who, as tireless
collaborators in New York, wanted a little space for their solo material to
breathe. Switching off instruments, songwriters, and moods with ease, the
group draws on its diverse musical heritage and the diverse talents of its
members. Made up of Yoko Kikuchi, Casey Holford, and Daoud Tyler-Ameen.

*Dead Rabbit

Dead Rabbit is a progressive indie rock band from Staten Island. They sound
like David Bowie, Jefferson Airplane, and ABBA having a crazy orgy weekend.

Dear Chris,

Perhaps libelous would be a better word than careless.

And rather than acknowledging this major mistake on the part of
Baratier, you twice question whether I am "indeed" Monday Love.  ML has
an actual name and it's available on the forum.  I choose not to use it
because he was outed against his will, just as I was.  ML has a poet
wife (as do I) and he has young children.  I would not want him and his
family to suffer the nastiness I've been subjected to in the past two
years.  I hope people will consider his family, even if you disagree
with his words.

Thank you,
Alan

From: "Stephen Vincent" <steph484@PACBELL.NET>

The quick answer to this is, "No," Stephen.  Here, "mort" doesn't link to
the French word for "death".  Probably originally Romani, entering English
thieves' cant in the early 16thC via Anglo-Romani rather than fully
inflected Romani. [Hey, that's a guess, so don't quote me!]

(Off the top of my head) "Dead Man Walking" is pretty much American, 19th or
post-19thC, and may be specifically connected to execution by the electric
chair.

[Just checked, and it isn't in Beale/Partridge, Partridge's Dict/Underworld,
or Green's Cassell/Slang, so may be very recent -- post 1950?]

Another distinction would be that in English executions, the condemned were
taken to the gallows in a cart -- thus no walking for them at the end, poor
buggers.

They came to the nubbing cheat -- the terms "nubbing" and "cheat" ["cheat"
means, roughly, "thing" -- as in "cackling cheat", a goose, etc.] both go
back to the 1560s in England, and persist quite late.  Larry, who is topped
in Dublin in the 1780s, ends there, in "The Night Before Larry Was
Stretched" (or "De Nite Afore Larry Was Stretched" -- occasionally the
original version does make it into print, but more common is the heavily
Anglicised version).

Thomas Mount, just before he was executed in Rhode Island in 1791, dictated
the following song from memory:

A Song made by a Flash Cove the Evening before his Execution.

My blowen came here t'other night,
She fetch'd us a jorum of diddle,
To the prisoners it gave great delight,
And we hopp'd it away to the fiddle.

But our trade of diving doth fail,
My blowen has chang'd habitations;
For now she pads in the gaol,
And laughs at the flats of the nation.

But at length the dull-gown's-man comes in
And tips me soft tales of repentance,
When on him I do cast my brow,
I care not one fig for his sentence.

By th' gullet I'll be ty'd very tight
To-morrow:-my blowen pray for us,
My peepers will be hid from the light,
The tumbler shoves off, so I morris.

    So it goes ...

Robin

Subject:      El Spontaneo: sponteous bop/"craft" (Simic on Creeley)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

       In one of Wiiliam S. Burroughs' recorded pieces, he speaks of
"El Spontaneo"--the sudden eruption into the ring at a Corrida of an
aspiring afficianado who momentarliy takes charge, essaying some
passes with his cape and hoping to distract the bull's attention to
himself rather than the "real" Matador.
       The dangerous intrusion of the run amok amateur into the world
of the professional ritual of Death!
       Despite many times being hauled away by the authorities and
keepers of order of the ritual, there will be always the  reappearance
of El Spontaneo!  Whether it is the same person or another, El
Spontaneo's unquenchable desire for the immortality of the ring
insures repeat performances.
        One who is a legend in their own mind may take hold of reality
and turn it into their own personal mythology.
         El Spontaneo literally "puts his life on the line" in the
confrontation with a real Death in a ritual of Death.  Yet the
encounter with the bull is denied him by the maintainers of    ritual,
of the organized meanings and practices of Death.
      El Spontaneo is a relative of Don Quixote--who tilted with
windmills thinking them rival Knights, and was beset upon by real life
robbers.  It is not the real bull of ritual or the windmills-knights
who leave El Spontaneo and Don Quixote battered and bruised, but the
keepers of the gates of the  Real.

     Jack Kerouac was the writer and voice for Spontaneous Bop Prosody
against what he saw as the confinements of "craft."  Taking his cue
from an architect friend, Kerouac "sketched" for years in pocket
notebooks the views before him, whether the concrete world or the
worlds of memory and dream.  Kerouac's visual ksetching isn't done
with the sounds cut off--but to the rhythms heard in the world around
him, and those heard in his head--Be Bop phrasings, Shakesespeare,s
sonnets, the utterances and sing song nonsense rhymes of the  Joual
language, (Kerouac, like Simic, is not an English-first language
speaker/writer, nor was Conrad or Nabokocv so the impugning of Simic's
status as such is rather sad).  The sites/sights/cites Kerouac worked
with he found a loose form for in the size of the notebook page.
Working with the notebooks, from intense memory and the "legendary"
qualities of his life, Kerouac wrote his "Legend of Dulouz" many
volumes of Spontaneous Bop prosody typed at super-high-octane speeds.
"Writing is silent meditation going a hundred miles an hour," he said,
while Truman Capote opined, "it's not writing, it's typing."
      As Diane di Pima pointed out, spontaneity is not arrived at in
the manner of El Spontaneo, who simply leaps in to the ring with Death
and trusts to his imagined Legendary Genius.  It is arrived at--and
continues-- through years of disciplined work.  Burroughs noted that
even when he first met Kerouac, in the mid 1940's,  before the
publication of The Town and the City, written much in the manner of
Thomas Wolfe, Kerouac had written millions of words. When he
"discovered" his Spontaneous Bop Prosody method, Kerouac had exhausted
the methods of "craft" in his search for the "wild form" he needed to
present his "book movie, the original American form."
      The opening page of "Vanity of Duluoz," Kerouac's last published
novel in his lifteime, he explains that this book will be written in
standardized grammar, punctuation, prose, for "the new illiterate
generation." In some of his lat essays, he writes of his encounter
with "unreadabilitiy"--on the one hand the for him "unreadable" works
of "craft" and on the other, others finding his works "unreadable."
          Kerouac notes (so to speak) that his work has gone far over
into pure sound.  (Bob Cobbing, who published the first complete
edition of Kerouac's "Old Angel Midnight" said that this and Joyce's
Finegan's Wake are the two greatest sound poems of the English
language.)  Like Russian Futurism's Zaum, Kerouac's Sponatneous Bop
prosody unmorring of words, syllables, letters from "rational"
orderings is a journey into an outer space of "Zaum" (which translated
means "beyond-sense" or "transrational") and so is a writing of the
future, for space explorers, and to get published, he will have to
return to the earth-bound strictures of the prose of Vanity of Duluoz,
to show the skeptics that is not "merely" typing.
       Don Cherry, the great Jazz musican, would often say that "Free
Jazz canonly be played by superbly disciplined musicians."  It's not
like the free form noodling of Freak Out jams, but something worked at
 through a lifetime of practice and the continau study of musical
forms, an encylopeiac kowledge carried in the mind on which to be able
to draw in the spontaneous creation of the Free.
       The disagreement and discussion about the Spontaneous and the
"crafted" is a very very old one.  One of the most famous examples is
"Giotto's Circle."  A competition for a large and distinguished,
exalted commission was held and painters all over Italy set to work at
their cartoons, sketches, tons of proposed works were examined, all
showing off as much as possible the great skills of the artists.  Yet
when the judges came to visit Giotto, he had no piles of impressive
work to display at all.
         The judges were stunned--Giotto not competing?  I will show
you all you need to know, said Giotto, and bent down and drew on the
dusty floor a perfect circle.
         Fortunetly for the history and Legends of art--the judges
were no dummies.  They immediately gave the commision to Giotto for
his Spontaneous Creation, for they realized embodied in it was the
most disciplined "craft" in Italy.

        On the other hand, one can cite a very great many works which
seem to be, sound like, look like, read as, "spontaneous"
compositions, sprung like Athena from the head of Zeus or emerging
like Aphrodite from the sea.  Yet that "spontaneous" surface is made
up of thousands of revisions, repaintings, changes of notes.
       Or--as Poe demonstrates in "The Philopshy of Composition," one
can first create a work and then reconstruct the creation as a series
of rational choices, made on the basis of well thought through
deductive reasonings of the sort Poe has his detective Dupin put to
use in finding the "Purloined Letter" and solving the "Murders in the
Rue Morgue" and "The Mystery of Marie Roget."  (A fascinating book on
the real life case and Poe's fictional "solving" of it during the
course of its ongoing investigation came out this year, called The
Little Cigar Store Girl.)
      Works that have the explosive energy and fury of spontaneous
outbursts like Rimbaud's "A Season in Hell" and the works of L-F
Celine, for example, were actually achieved through a process of
drastic revisions. Mayakovsky's "How Are Verses Made?" also
demonstrates this form of arrival at spontaneity of expression.
       The same thing can be done in music and film, video
studios--the editing of many different different "takes' can be
experienced by the listener and viewer as something occuring
spontaneously, "live" while al the while being made of a long series
of edits, rearrangements, careful  "craft" "after the fact."
       The question of spontaneity itself in writing is therefore a
much more complex question, for it involves asking--what is the
"spontaneous" the writer is working with?  Is it the METHOD of
composition itself--or the deductive creation of the  EFFECT of
spontaneity?
         The spontaneous involves more than what I am with Diane di
Prima in thinking of as the meaning of Creeley's use of the word
"momently."  I think what Simic is driving at, though he very much
glosses over the whole issue, is that what is "momently" needs to be
sroted out from the consideration of every moment as being "momently"
and of every word that one writes being necessarily "of moment" rather
than "of the moment."
      And then, if that is the case, when choosing what is "momently"
how much does the "effect" of the "momently" have to do with a concern
with "spontaneity."
        That is, is the EFFECT, if not necessarily the METHOD, of any
concern to Simic?
         El Sponateno can be seen from one point of view as a poetic
character, an amateur so possesed by his own personal mythology of
being a Legend in His Own Mind that he needs no lengthy practice
whatsoever to accomplish what the long disciplines of the Professional
Matador can.  In fact, he assumes that is his own methods will, of
course, be far superior to those of the mundane reality of the
ritualized encounter with Death.  Yet to the vast majority of
afficianados, of course El Spontaneo will appear to be just another
deluded asshole interrupting all too mundanely the Art of the Corrida
and its ritual of Death.
         El Spontaneo, after all, may not be all that spontaneous,
having well in mind ahead of time the moment--the "momently"-opening
in which to explode into the ring and unveil his Greatness for the
Astonished and Adoring World to Behold!  He may actually turn out to
be possesed of some raw talent--many would-be Matadors have in fact
been able to launch a career in this manner--or he may just be another
form of "flasher," "exposing himself in public" for the world to gawk
and reel in revulsion at his pathetic display.
         Is he making the "leap into the void" of an Yves Klein
foto-action Art Work?  Or  a leap into the void of a Legend which both
ritual and reality are prepared to tear to shreds?
         I think before the "Simic on Creeley" turns into a war of
competing rhetorics which are presented as drastic barriers and
differences in philosophy, life style, politics, ideologies of the
soul and sociologoies of the criticisms of poetry and who is and is
not allowed to write and speak about them, one would be much more
interested in having the discussion be opened up to a consideration of
the ideas and terminologies involved. As I have been trying to
demonstrate, the issue of spontaneity is far more complex than is
being assumed for the most part, and before smashing Mr Simic to
pieces I would rather first like to find out what his sense of
spontaneity is, how he considers differences of Method and Effect in
relation to this, which then entails a questioning of "craft" and what
his ideas on these lines are.
    I think if one began a discussion from the ground up so to speak,
this would lead to a much more illuminating and useful discussion of
"poetics" and its roles in poetries and specifically in those of
Robert Creeley and Charles Simic, and of course, whoever wants to
actually carry on a real discussion rather than put on display the
current American pre-emptive attack madness or, the after-the-reading
desire for the head of this "uppity" "foreigner". The latter betrays
to me that Mr Simic is encountering questions of natioanal/ethnic
identiy which he hoped I am sure to have left behind,as much as it is
possible, which is not much, the very same violences carried to their
ultimate extremes in his country of origin.
    All too often anymore, as one knows, suddenly the question of
ethnicity and origins is introduced as a means to impugn a person's
thoughts, tastes, understandings, so that anyone who does not agree
100% with oneself and "the America for which (that) stands," must of
course be if not an "illegal" alien, most certainly a "suspect" alien,
not to be trusted, not to be listened to, not to have any real right
to being part of the conversation among what are recognized as the
"right" humans.
      I think if a meeting or series of them, or letters back and
forth with Mr Simic could be arranged, this would be very interesting
and illuminanting. Requiring  the disciplining of preparing oneself
for such an occaission by first arriving at a clearer understanding of
what one means when one utters so seemingly simple a word as
"spontaneity," would also help oneself more than simply hurling
epithets and turning this one article into a Crusade for the Holy Land
and the USA before even clarifying what the "war" is all about in the
first place.  Especially when it involve questions in "poetics" which
are  older than Aristotle's.
       Remember the old cartoon, "I have met the enemy and he is me?"
       Discipline isn't only in writing poetry but also in preparing
one's critiques of what is one feels is an injustice. Spontaneity in
the manner of attacking other's ideas without understanding even one's
own let alone theirs--and if that is what one is accusing mr simic of,
one should be even more aware of this regarding one self before
confronting him--such spontanenity can lead straight to the lynch mob,
Already every day there are more and more examples in the news of
persons not allowed to speak or teach or have writings published,
speak their minds--in the USA.  And the censoring and firing and
banning isn't being done by the crowd at Fox only, by "institutions of
higher learning," which supposedly are opposed to such things.   If
one believes in Freedom of Speech, then one needs to act responsably
before attacking a person,an article with such virulence.
         That is why, again, I return to the question of spontaneity.
Does a "poetics" of the spontaneous have to mean also the knee jerk
reaction to any criticisms, any doubts, any points of view, which even
in the slightest apparently "threaten" one's own?
          It begins to sound a lot like that phrase from a play
employed by I believe Herman Goering--"When I hear the word 'Culture,"
I reach for my revolver."
         "Culture" meaning someone else's idea of it--not one's own, to be sure.
          Or, in keeping with the complexity of the issue of the
spontaneous yet again, Andre Breton's assertion that "the perfect
Surrealist Act" would be to go into a crowd and start firing at random
with a revolver.
          One can shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
           Or, being poets truly concerned with issues of
"poetics,"--essay an exchange of letters, conversations--and find out
for oneself as Olson would say.
           "Don't Believe the Hype"--as Public Enemy says.

(By pre-emptive attack madness"  I mean that before even reading the
article by Mr Simic, several persons "jumped the gun," and loudly
disparaging it, much as some on this list said outright they would not
only attack the Guantanamo Poets book, but on top of that not even
read or buy it! Which latter equivalence I found interesting--that
buying and reading are meant to be"=".  Heck, I read a huge number of
books at the store without ever buying them.  And, so far at any rate,
there arestill public and private libraries in existence also.)

This is quite a display, David, my goodness. Suspect part of 'the argument' against the 'spontaneous'  emerges from identifying the "spontaneous" with no training, no skills, etc., and consequently 'primitive' (another word used for various kinds of ethnic abuse and condescension).  Which makes me remember recording what are sometimes called "Praise Singers"  in a remote area of eastern Nigeria (then Ogoja Province). The singer could sing and boast in several languages (Ogjoja, Pidgin, Italian, 'official English', multiple neighboring tribes). In reference to spontaneity, I remember him boast of his gifts for improvisation:

 ...Gentility without ability
 Calls me a drunkard...

 When we asked what was the advantage of singing in several languages, he responded in what I thought was a brilliant counter-ethnocentric answer:

 ...the more languages with which I can sing, the further the story (song) will travel...

 He knew he was good and wanted to be heard, and have his songs celebrated everywhere.  (In reference to poems built on what superficially appear to be non-sense sounds).

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote:        In one of Wiiliam S. Burroughs' recorded pieces, he speaks of
"El Spontaneo"--the sudden eruption into the ring at a Corrida of an
aspiring afficianado who momentarliy takes charge, essaying some
passes with his cape and hoping to distract the bull's attention to
himself rather than the "real" Matador.
       The dangerous intrusion of the run amok amateur into the world
of the professional ritual of Death!
       Despite many times being hauled away by the authorities and
keepers of order of the ritual, there will be always the  reappearance
of El Spontaneo!  Whether it is the same person or another, El
Spontaneo's unquenchable desire for the immortality of the ring
insures repeat performances.
        One who is a legend in their own mind may take hold of reality
and turn it into their own personal mythology.
         El Spontaneo literally "puts his life on the line" in the
confrontation with a real Death in a ritual of Death.  Yet the
encounter with the bull is denied him by the maintainers of    ritual,
of the organized meanings and practices of Death.
      El Spontaneo is a relative of Don Quixote--who tilted with
windmills thinking them rival Knights, and was beset upon by real life
robbers.  It is not the real bull of ritual or the windmills-knights
who leave El Spontaneo and Don Quixote battered and bruised, but the
keepers of the gates of the  Real.

     Jack Kerouac was the writer and voice for Spontaneous Bop Prosody
against what he saw as the confinements of "craft."  Taking his cue
from an architect friend, Kerouac "sketched" for years in pocket
notebooks the views before him, whether the concrete world or the
worlds of memory and dream.  Kerouac's visual ksetching isn't done
with the sounds cut off--but to the rhythms heard in the world around
him, and those heard in his head--Be Bop phrasings, Shakesespeare,s
sonnets, the utterances and sing song nonsense rhymes of the  Joual
language, (Kerouac, like Simic, is not an English-first language
speaker/writer, nor was Conrad or Nabokocv so the impugning of Simic's
status as such is rather sad).  The sites/sights/cites Kerouac worked
with he found a loose form for in the size of the notebook page.
Working with the notebooks, from intense memory and the "legendary"
qualities of his life, Kerouac wrote his "Legend of Dulouz" many
volumes of Spontaneous Bop prosody typed at super-high-octane speeds.
"Writing is silent meditation going a hundred miles an hour," he said,
while Truman Capote opined, "it's not writing, it's typing."
      As Diane di Pima pointed out, spontaneity is not arrived at in
the manner of El Spontaneo, who simply leaps in to the ring with Death
and trusts to his imagined Legendary Genius.  It is arrived at--and
continues-- through years of disciplined work.  Burroughs noted that
even when he first met Kerouac, in the mid 1940's,  before the
publication of The Town and the City, written much in the manner of
Thomas Wolfe, Kerouac had written millions of words. When he
"discovered" his Spontaneous Bop Prosody method, Kerouac had exhausted
the methods of "craft" in his search for the "wild form" he needed to
present his "book movie, the original American form."
      The opening page of "Vanity of Duluoz," Kerouac's last published
novel in his lifteime, he explains that this book will be written in
standardized grammar, punctuation, prose, for "the new illiterate
generation." In some of his lat essays, he writes of his encounter
with "unreadabilitiy"--on the one hand the for him "unreadable" works
of "craft" and on the other, others finding his works "unreadable."
          Kerouac notes (so to speak) that his work has gone far over
into pure sound.  (Bob Cobbing, who published the first complete
edition of Kerouac's "Old Angel Midnight" said that this and Joyce's
Finegan's Wake are the two greatest sound poems of the English
language.)  Like Russian Futurism's Zaum, Kerouac's Sponatneous Bop
prosody unmorring of words, syllables, letters from "rational"
orderings is a journey into an outer space of "Zaum" (which translated
means "beyond-sense" or "transrational") and so is a writing of the
future, for space explorers, and to get published, he will have to
return to the earth-bound strictures of the prose of Vanity of Duluoz,
to show the skeptics that is not "merely" typing.
       Don Cherry, the great Jazz musican, would often say that "Free
Jazz canonly be played by superbly disciplined musicians."  It's not
like the free form noodling of Freak Out jams, but something worked at
 through a lifetime of practice and the continau study of musical
forms, an encylopeiac kowledge carried in the mind on which to be able
to draw in the spontaneous creation of the Free.
       The disagreement and discussion about the Spontaneous and the
"crafted" is a very very old one.  One of the most famous examples is
"Giotto's Circle."  A competition for a large and distinguished,
exalted commission was held and painters all over Italy set to work at
their cartoons, sketches, tons of proposed works were examined, all
showing off as much as possible the great skills of the artists.  Yet
when the judges came to visit Giotto, he had no piles of impressive
work to display at all.
         The judges were stunned--Giotto not competing?  I will show
you all you need to know, said Giotto, and bent down and drew on the
dusty floor a perfect circle.
         Fortunetly for the history and Legends of art--the judges
were no dummies.  They immediately gave the commision to Giotto for
his Spontaneous Creation, for they realized embodied in it was the
most disciplined "craft" in Italy.

        On the other hand, one can cite a very great many works which
seem to be, sound like, look like, read as, "spontaneous"
compositions, sprung like Athena from the head of Zeus or emerging
like Aphrodite from the sea.  Yet that "spontaneous" surface is made
up of thousands of revisions, repaintings, changes of notes.
       Or--as Poe demonstrates in "The Philopshy of Composition," one
can first create a work and then reconstruct the creation as a series
of rational choices, made on the basis of well thought through
deductive reasonings of the sort Poe has his detective Dupin put to
use in finding the "Purloined Letter" and solving the "Murders in the
Rue Morgue" and "The Mystery of Marie Roget."  (A fascinating book on
the real life case and Poe's fictional "solving" of it during the
course of its ongoing investigation came out this year, called The
Little Cigar Store Girl.)
      Works that have the explosive energy and fury of spontaneous
outbursts like Rimbaud's "A Season in Hell" and the works of L-F
Celine, for example, were actually achieved through a process of
drastic revisions. Mayakovsky's "How Are Verses Made?" also
demonstrates this form of arrival at spontaneity of expression.
       The same thing can be done in music and film, video
studios--the editing of many different different "takes' can be
experienced by the listener and viewer as something occuring
spontaneously, "live" while al the while being made of a long series
of edits, rearrangements, careful  "craft" "after the fact."
       The question of spontaneity itself in writing is therefore a
much more complex question, for it involves asking--what is the
"spontaneous" the writer is working with?  Is it the METHOD of
composition itself--or the deductive creation of the  EFFECT of
spontaneity?
         The spontaneous involves more than what I am with Diane di
Prima in thinking of as the meaning of Creeley's use of the word
"momently."  I think what Simic is driving at, though he very much
glosses over the whole issue, is that what is "momently" needs to be
sroted out from the consideration of every moment as being "momently"
and of every word that one writes being necessarily "of moment" rather
than "of the moment."
      And then, if that is the case, when choosing what is "momently"
how much does the "effect" of the "momently" have to do with a concern
with "spontaneity."
        That is, is the EFFECT, if not necessarily the METHOD, of any
concern to Simic?
         El Sponateno can be seen from one point of view as a poetic
character, an amateur so possesed by his own personal mythology of
being a Legend in His Own Mind that he needs no lengthy practice
whatsoever to accomplish what the long disciplines of the Professional
Matador can.  In fact, he assumes that is his own methods will, of
course, be far superior to those of the mundane reality of the
ritualized encounter with Death.  Yet to the vast majority of
afficianados, of course El Spontaneo will appear to be just another
deluded asshole interrupting all too mundanely the Art of the Corrida
and its ritual of Death.
         El Spontaneo, after all, may not be all that spontaneous,
having well in mind ahead of time the moment--the "momently"-opening
in which to explode into the ring and unveil his Greatness for the
Astonished and Adoring World to Behold!  He may actually turn out to
be possesed of some raw talent--many would-be Matadors have in fact
been able to launch a career in this manner--or he may just be another
form of "flasher," "exposing himself in public" for the world to gawk
and reel in revulsion at his pathetic display.
         Is he making the "leap into the void" of an Yves Klein
foto-action Art Work?  Or  a leap into the void of a Legend which both
ritual and reality are prepared to tear to shreds?
         I think before the "Simic on Creeley" turns into a war of
competing rhetorics which are presented as drastic barriers and
differences in philosophy, life style, politics, ideologies of the
soul and sociologoies of the criticisms of poetry and who is and is
not allowed to write and speak about them, one would be much more
interested in having the discussion be opened up to a consideration of
the ideas and terminologies involved. As I have been trying to
demonstrate, the issue of spontaneity is far more complex than is
being assumed for the most part, and before smashing Mr Simic to
pieces I would rather first like to find out what his sense of
spontaneity is, how he considers differences of Method and Effect in
relation to this, which then entails a questioning of "craft" and what
his ideas on these lines are.
    I think if one began a discussion from the ground up so to speak,
this would lead to a much more illuminating and useful discussion of
"poetics" and its roles in poetries and specifically in those of
Robert Creeley and Charles Simic, and of course, whoever wants to
actually carry on a real discussion rather than put on display the
current American pre-emptive attack madness or, the after-the-reading
desire for the head of this "uppity" "foreigner". The latter betrays
to me that Mr Simic is encountering questions of natioanal/ethnic
identiy which he hoped I am sure to have left behind,as much as it is
possible, which is not much, the very same violences carried to their
ultimate extremes in his country of origin.
    All too often anymore, as one knows, suddenly the question of
ethnicity and origins is introduced as a means to impugn a person's
thoughts, tastes, understandings, so that anyone who does not agree
100% with oneself and "the America for which (that) stands," must of
course be if not an "illegal" alien, most certainly a "suspect" alien,
not to be trusted, not to be listened to, not to have any real right
to being part of the conversation among what are recognized as the
"right" humans.
      I think if a meeting or series of them, or letters back and
forth with Mr Simic could be arranged, this would be very interesting
and illuminanting. Requiring  the disciplining of preparing oneself
for such an occaission by first arriving at a clearer understanding of
what one means when one utters so seemingly simple a word as
"spontaneity," would also help oneself more than simply hurling
epithets and turning this one article into a Crusade for the Holy Land
and the USA before even clarifying what the "war" is all about in the
first place.  Especially when it involve questions in "poetics" which
are  older than Aristotle's.
       Remember the old cartoon, "I have met the enemy and he is me?"
       Discipline isn't only in writing poetry but also in preparing
one's critiques of what is one feels is an injustice. Spontaneity in
the manner of attacking other's ideas without understanding even one's
own let alone theirs--and if that is what one is accusing mr simic of,
one should be even more aware of this regarding one self before
confronting him--such spontanenity can lead straight to the lynch mob,
Already every day there are more and more examples in the news of
persons not allowed to speak or teach or have writings published,
speak their minds--in the USA.  And the censoring and firing and
banning isn't being done by the crowd at Fox only, by "institutions of
higher learning," which supposedly are opposed to such things.   If
one believes in Freedom of Speech, then one needs to act responsably
before attacking a person,an article with such virulence.
         That is why, again, I return to the question of spontaneity.
Does a "poetics" of the spontaneous have to mean also the knee jerk
reaction to any criticisms, any doubts, any points of view, which even
in the slightest apparently "threaten" one's own?
          It begins to sound a lot like that phrase from a play
employed by I believe Herman Goering--"When I hear the word 'Culture,"
I reach for my revolver."
         "Culture" meaning someone else's idea of it--not one's own, to be sure.
          Or, in keeping with the complexity of the issue of the
spontaneous yet again, Andre Breton's assertion that "the perfect
Surrealist Act" would be to go into a crowd and start firing at random
with a revolver.
          One can shoot first and ask questions afterwards.
           Or, being poets truly concerned with issues of
"poetics,"--essay an exchange of letters, conversations--and find out
for oneself as Olson would say.
           "Don't Believe the Hype"--as Public Enemy says.

(By pre-emptive attack madness"  I mean that before even reading the
article by Mr Simic, several persons "jumped the gun," and loudly
disparaging it, much as some on this list said outright they would not
only attack the Guantanamo Poets book, but on top of that not even
read or buy it! Which latter equivalence I found interesting--that
buying and reading are meant to be"=".  Heck, I read a huge number of
books at the store without ever buying them.  And, so far at any rate,
there arestill public and private libraries in existence also.)

Death-Knell. Or Death Knell.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/weekinreview/07mcgrath.html

By CHARLES McGRATH
Published: October 7, 2007

THE Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the scaled-down, two-volume =20
version of the mammoth 20-volume O.E.D., just got a little shorter. =20
With the dispatch of a waiter flicking away flyspecks, the editor, =20
Angus Stevenson, eliminated some 16,000 hyphens from the sixth =20
edition, published last month. =93People are not confident about using =20=

hyphens anymore,=94 he said. =93They=92re not really sure what they=92re =
for.=94
Skip to next paragraph
Ellen Lupton

The dictionary is not dropping all hyphens. The ones in certain =20
compounds remain (=93well-being,=94 for example), as do those indicating =
=20
a word break at the right-hand margin =97 the use for which this =20
versatile little punctuation mark, a variation on the slash, the all-=20
purpose medieval punctuation, was invented in the first place.

What=92s getting the heave are most hyphens linking the halves of a =20
compound noun. Some, like =93ice cream,=94 =93fig leaf,=94 =93hobby =
horse=94 and =20
=93water bed,=94 have been fractured into two words, while many others, =20=

like =93 bumblebee,=94 =93crybaby=94 and =93pigeonhole,=94 have been =
squeezed =20
into one.

That =93ice cream=94 and =93bumblebee=94 ever had hyphens to begin with =20=

suggests an excess of fussiness on the part of older lexicographers, =20
and may explain some of Mr. Stevenson=92s annoyance. The issue of =20
proper hyphenation has always been vexing for the Brits, far more =20
than it is for us, and occasioned perhaps the single crankiest =20
article in Fowler=92s =93Dictionary of Modern English Usage,=94 first =20=

published in 1926.

=93The chaos prevailing among writers or printers or both regarding the =20=

use of hyphens is discreditable to English education,=94 he began, and =20=

about halfway through he threw up his hands and said of the examples =20
he had been citing, =93the evidence they afford=94 is =93that common =
sense =20
is in fact far from common.=94

Fowler was in favor of hyphens. They sprinkle his own text like =20
dandruff and, along with his fetish for the ampersand, give it a =20
musty, old-fashioned look. This is why designers hate to see hyphens =20
flecking the page, and indeed they are antique, unnecessary marks in =20
many instances.

But that=92s also part of their appeal. They=92re records of how the =20
language changes, and in the old days, before the Shorter Oxford got =20
into the sundering business, they indicated a sort of halfway point, =20
a way station in the progress of a new usage. Two terms get linked =20
together =97 =93tiddly-wink,=94 let=92s say, or =93cell-phone=94 =97 and =
then over =20
time that little hitch is eroded, worn away by familiarity. In a few =20
years, for example, people will be amused to discover that email used =20=

to be e-mail.

The greatest hyphenator ever was Shakespeare (or Shak-speare in some =20
contemporary spellings) because he was so busy adding new words, many =20=

of them compounds, to English: =93sea-change,=94 =93leap-frog,=94 =93bare-=
=20
faced,=94 =93fancy-free.=94 Milton also hyphenated a lot (=93dew-drops,=94=
 =93man-=20
slaughter,=94 =93eye-sight=94) and so did Donne, who loved compounds =
like =20
=93death-bed=94 and =93passing-bell,=94 where the hyphen carries almost =20=

metaphorical weight, a reminder of what Eliot called his singular =20
talent for yoking unlike ideas.

At the other end of the spectrum is E. E. Cummings, who turned his =20
back on not just the hyphen but punctuation in general, and in this =20
respect was way ahead of his time. Cummings wrote back in the age of =20
real type, but looked forward to what might be called the =20
sanserification of print: the way our computer versions of type are =20
dropping all the little vestiges of metal fonts =97 the serifs, or =20
pleasing little curves and points jutting out from a letter in =20
traditional fonts, and, for that matter, the hyphen, the comma, the =20
quotation mark. Our print, once a replica of hand-lettering, now =20
aspires to the condition of the computer screen and the text message.

Even Mr. Stevenson puts in a good word for the hyphen especially =20
beloved by grammarians and so vexing to civilians, the one that turns =20=

a noun phrase into a compound adjective. A slippery-eel salesman, for =20=

example, sells slippery eels, while a slippery eel salesman takes =20
your money and slinks away.

Textbooks used to be full of examples like these (English-language =20
lessons and English language lessons; an odd-looking glass and an odd =20=

looking glass) but except in places like The New Yorker, which =20
punctiliously hyphenates all such phrases, ambiguous or not, this =20
useful, elegant hyphen has become a nicety, resorted to only in cases =20=

of extreme confusion and sometimes not even then. Most of the time =20
we=92re not troubled, either because we=92re good at figuring things out =
=20
(a high school student is most likely someone attending secondary =20
school rather than a pupil puffing a joint) or because we no longer =20
pay much attention to punctuation to begin with.

In many cases the hyphen is probably an affectation =97 like wearing =20
spats, say. And if Mr. Stevenson is right about the general confusion =20=

over hyphen usage, a lot of us were putting on our spats improperly. =20
We wore them with Bermuda shorts, so to speak. But they did look =20
pretty good sometimes =97 spiffy and genteel =97 and gave our prose an =20=

extra strut. We may feel a little under-dressed =97 underdressed, =20
rather =97 without them.=

Amicus curiae brief in the case of Simic v. Creeley:

Calling Charles Simic revanchist seems like tail chasing if you have a look
at today's review of Christian Wiman's book of essays "Ambition and
Survival" in the Times. Here's a poet who can't recognize flies in milk, or
the difference between John Ashbery and Jorie Graham, who he casually lumps
together and calls "airless". Ken Tucker gets in a couple nice passes and
damns Wiman with faint praise: "I wish him the best life he can have."
Simic, whose work is so often playful and improvisatory and who doesn't
properly belong to any camp, much less a quietist or a classicizing one, is
getting keelhauled; Wiman is editor at Poetry magazine and actively
proselytizes against experiment, abstraction, invention, and the whole
project of modernism in poetry.

What difference  can it possibly make? We're talking about poetry here. Is=

there any danger someone's kid is going to be mocked on the playground, or=

someone's wife is going to be shunned at the grocery, or someone's husband=

is in danger of being kicked out of Kiwanis because of a post to a poetry =
email
list?

Keep some sense of perspective, for goodness's sake. No one cares about
this stuff except the people signed up to this and some other lists and a =
few
bulletin boards.

David: This is off the mark in a bunch of ways,=20
not least the starkness of the opposition you put=20
forward, which is hardly what Diane was talking=20
about. Life isn't long enough for a detailed=20
response. One point I think does need making.=20
Diane isn't indulging in anything like patriotic=20
games when she says, rather mildly, "It may be=20
that Mr. Simic lacks the language skills to read=20
Creeley=8Band perhaps many other American poets. It=20
is hard=8Balmost impossible--to hear all the=20
layerings of meaning in any but your native=20
tongue." She's merely noting that the acquisition=20
of a native ear for all the subtlties of language=20
and dialect is very rare after early childhood.=20
One can write very well in the acquired language,=20
of course, without that degree of awareness of=20
the idiom, but even that's extremely rare.

I spent seven years working with Jose Kozer on=20
the translation of his poems. Jose has lived in a=20
largely English-speaking environment since his=20
18th birthday, and his English is articulate and=20
virtually flawless, and barely accented.=20
Nonetheless, he is aware that he has nothing like=20
the depth of awareness of English that he has of=20
Spanish. We often spent hours weighing the=20
nuances of a Spanish word and the English=20
approximations I planned to use, and he was=20
usually unaware of many of the nuances of the English.

Of the examples you give, Conrad never had to=20
confront a poetry as subtle as Creeley's, and=20
Nabokov's taste in English-language poetry was=20
decidedly conservative, almost Russian in its=20
formalism. The foreigner's ear tends to overvalue=20
the least subtle effects--those he or she can=20
hear--in the new language, which is why Dylan=20
Thomas, for example, is much more popular among=20
Spanish-language poets than among anglophones and=20
Lorca's ballads more popular among anglophones=20
than the Walt Whitman or the Poet in New York. As=20
to Kerouac, his early separation from English was=20
nothing near as complete (nor as long-lasting) as=20
Conrad's, Nabokov's, or Simic's.

I don't think Simic's inability to hear what's=20
going on in Creeley and a great deal of other US=20
poetry is of this nature, though. He shares it with a lot of native=

Gosh, not to cast more ill into the world, after reading this review of Wiman's essays, I almost have to bite my tongue to keep from making comparisons with Judge Clarence Thomas (the bigoted, reactionary, angry person that emerges in the Justice's new autobiography)!!  Wiman's dismissal of anything written without metric form, suspense and closure seems otherworldly! (With all respect to the great ones in this modern field, say Thom Gunn). Combined with his hostile, disparaging sense of the exclusion of much else. He strikes me as the exemplar of the contemporary Gated, i.e., insular,  community But, going back to Thomas, Wiman, similarly, strikes me as a 'strict-constitutionalist' when it comes to what is permitted. The history of poetry - modernism, post-modernism, etc et al - is not about to clutter Wiman's palette! Let's not even imagine the issue of politics,

 Well, if not Wiman, somebody else would be doing the job - and, for comfort, 'without polarities, no progression'. So we should be thankful!!

Davey Volner <davey.volner@GMAIL.COM> wrote: Amicus curiae brief in the case of Simic v. Creeley:

Calling Charles Simic revanchist seems like tail chasing if you have a look
at today's review of Christian Wiman's book of essays "Ambition and
Survival" in the Times. Here's a poet who can't recognize flies in milk, or
the difference between John Ashbery and Jorie Graham, who he casually lumps
together and calls "airless". Ken Tucker gets in a couple nice passes and
damns Wiman with faint praise: "I wish him the best life he can have."
Simic, whose work is so often playful and improvisatory and who doesn't
properly belong to any camp, much less a quietist or a classicizing one, is
getting keelhauled; Wiman is editor at Poetry magazine and actively
proselytizes against experiment, abstraction, invention, and the whole
project of modernism in poetry.

=C2=A0
By CHARLES McGRATH=C2=A0
Published: October 7, 2007=C2=A0
=C2=A0
THE Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, the scaled-down, two-volume version o=
f the mammoth 20-volume O.E.D., just got a little shorter. With the dispatch=
 of a waiter flicking away flyspecks, the editor, Angus Stevenson, eliminate=
d some 16,000 hyphens from the sixth edition, published last month. =E2=80=
=9CPeople are not confident about using hyphens anymore,=E2=80=9D he said.=20=
=E2=80=9CThey=E2=80=99re not really sure what they=E2=80=99re for.=E2=80=9D=
=C2=A0
Skip to next paragraph=C2=A0
Ellen Lupton=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The dictionary is not dropping all hyphens. The ones in certain compounds re=
main (=E2=80=9Cwell-being,=E2=80=9D for example), as do those indicating a w=
ord break at the right-hand margin =E2=80=94 the use for which this versatil=
e little punctuation mark, a variation on the slash, the all-purpose medieva=
l punctuation, was invented in the first place.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
What=E2=80=99s getting the heave are most hyphens linking the halves of a co=
mpound noun. Some, like =E2=80=9Cice cream,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cfig leaf,=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9Chobby horse=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cwater bed,=E2=80=9D have b=
een fractured into two words, while many others, like =E2=80=9C bumblebee,=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Ccrybaby=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cpigeonhole,=E2=80=9D have b=
een squeezed into one.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
That =E2=80=9Cice cream=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cbumblebee=E2=80=9D ever had hy=
phens to begin with suggests an excess of fussiness on the part of older lex=
icographers, and may explain some of Mr. Stevenson=E2=80=99s annoyance. The=20=
issue of proper hyphenation has always been vexing for the Brits, far more t=
han it is for us, and occasioned perhaps the single crankiest article in Fow=
ler=E2=80=99s =E2=80=9CDictionary of Modern English Usage,=E2=80=9D first pu=
blished in 1926.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
=E2=80=9CThe chaos prevailing among writers or printers or both regarding th=
e use of hyphens is discreditable to English education,=E2=80=9D he began, a=
nd about halfway through he threw up his hands and said of the examples he h=
ad been citing, =E2=80=9Cthe evidence they afford=E2=80=9D is =E2=80=9Cthat=20=
common sense is in fact far from common.=E2=80=9D=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Fowler was in favor of hyphens. They sprinkle his own text like dandruff and=
, along with his fetish for the ampersand, give it a musty, old-fashioned lo=
ok. This is why designers hate to see hyphens flecking the page, and indeed=20=
they are antique, unnecessary marks in many instances.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
But that=E2=80=99s also part of their appeal. They=E2=80=99re records of how=
 the language changes, and in the old days, before the Shorter Oxford got in=
to the sundering business, they indicated a sort of halfway point, a way sta=
tion in the progress of a new usage. Two terms get linked together =E2=80=
=94 =E2=80=9Ctiddly-wink,=E2=80=9D let=E2=80=99s say, or =E2=80=9Ccell-phone=
=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 and then over time that little hitch is eroded, worn awa=
y by familiarity. In a few years, for example, people will be amused to disc=
over that email used to be e-mail.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
The greatest hyphenator ever was Shakespeare (or Shak-speare in some contemp=
orary spellings) because he was so busy adding new words, many of them compo=
unds, to English: =E2=80=9Csea-change,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cleap-frog,=E2=80=
=9D =E2=80=9Cbare-faced,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cfancy-free.=E2=80=9D Milton also=20=
hyphenated a lot (=E2=80=9Cdew-drops,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cman-slaughter,=E2=
=80=9D =E2=80=9Ceye-sight=E2=80=9D) and so did Donne, who loved compounds li=
ke =E2=80=9Cdeath-bed=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cpassing-bell,=E2=80=9D where the=
 hyphen carries almost metaphorical weight, a reminder of what Eliot called=20=
his singular talent for yoking unlike ideas.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
At the other end of the spectrum is E. E. Cummings, who turned his back on n=
ot just the hyphen but punctuation in general, and in this respect was way a=
head of his time. Cummings wrote back in the age of real type, but looked fo=
rward to what might be called the sanserification of print: the way our comp=
uter versions of type are dropping all the little vestiges of metal fonts=20=
=E2=80=94 the serifs, or pleasing little curves and points jutting out from=20=
a letter in traditional fonts, and, for that matter, the hyphen, the comma,=20=
the quotation mark. Our print, once a replica of hand-lettering, now aspires=
 to the condition of the computer screen and the text message.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Even Mr. Stevenson puts in a good word for the hyphen especially beloved by=20=
grammarians and so vexing to civilians, the one that turns a noun phrase int=
o a compound adjective. A slippery-eel salesman, for example, sells slippery=
 eels, while a slippery eel salesman takes your money and slinks away.=C2=
=A0
=C2=A0
Textbooks used to be full of examples like these (English-language lessons a=
nd English language lessons; an odd-looking glass and an odd looking glass)=20=
but except in places like The New Yorker, which punctiliously hyphenates all=
 such phrases, ambiguous or not, this useful, elegant hyphen has become a ni=
cety, resorted to only in cases of extreme confusion and sometimes not even=20=
then. Most of the time we=E2=80=99re not troubled, either because we=E2=80=
=99re good at figuring things out (a high school student is most likely some=
one attending secondary school rather than a pupil puffing a joint) or becau=
se we no longer pay much attention to punctuation to begin with.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
In many cases the hyphen is probably an affectation =E2=80=94 like wearing s=
pats, say. And if Mr. Stevenson is right about the general confusion over hy=
phen usage, a lot of us were putting on our spats improperly. We wore them w=
ith Bermuda shorts, so to speak. But they did look pretty good sometimes=20=
=E2=80=94 spiffy and genteel =E2=80=94 and gave our prose an extra strut. We=
 may feel a little under-dressed =E2=80=94 underdressed, rather =E2=80=94 wi=
thout them.=3D=C2=A0

I'm not here to get in an argument with you about the politics of po-biz.
Frankly, I don't really care anymore, and foetry.com exists only as an
archive.  It's not active because most poets are indifferent to anything
but themselves.

I am here only because Baratier lifted a paragraph from foetry.com,
written by someone, and attributed it to me, while calling it _my_
fabrication repeatedly.

Poets were "targeted" by foetry only when they took money from others to
further their own careers and those of their friends and lovers.  If their
families were mistreated in some way because of that, then don't blame the
messenger.  They shouldn't have cheated.

Those of you who have a problem with foetry.com are a little late.  Your
attempt to redirect your listmate's libelous actions with a post-foetry
attack look pretty foolish.

Signing off,
Alan

If, indeed, you are not "Monday Love," then maybe David's post is

Dear all:

In July & Aug, visiting new friends in Kolkata, had
some interesting discussions on the role of the poet
(plays, should play) in society. I would be interested
in hearing your own views on the topic. As ever, your
time and feedback will be appreciated - especially
given that there're lots of folks on the list.

Regards,
Alexander Jorgensen

Dedication

You whom I could not save
Listen to me.
Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another.
I swear, there is in me no wizardry of words.
I speak to you with silence like a cloud or a tree.

What strengthened me, for you was lethal.
You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one,
Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty,
Blind force with accomplished shape.

Here is the valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge
Going into white fog. Here is a broken city,
And the wind throws the screams of gulls on your grave
When I am talking with you.

What is poetry which does not save
Nations or people?
A connivance with official lies,
A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment,
Readings for sophomore girls.
That I wanted good poetry without knowing it,
That I discovered, late, its salutary aim,
In this and only this I find salvation.

They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds
To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds.
I put this book here for you, who once lived
So that you should visit us no more.

--Czeslaw Milosz, Warsaw, 1945

Signupz@bluehole,

Archives or live action left unproven (again, the burden of proof lies with
the accusers) are libelous, thanks to the "print" nature of the internet.

I don't know either you or Baratier, so any reference to "listmate" seems
odd, and self-victimizing. BUT...

Why not backchannel Baratier? What's the point of "post-Foetry"-esquefully
posting your skidmarked undies here?

Oh...and this...

Bulletin: Every time anyone takes money they are furthering their own
career. If you take money due to Foetry, you are furthering your own career=
.
Or...have you figured out a way to sustain life with those $500 poetry
awards and contributor copies?

Lastly....

The poems he cites as=C2=A0"good Creeley" and those he assigns (romantically=

David: This is off the mark in a bunch of ways, not least the starkness of t=
he opposition you put forward, which is hardly what Diane was talking about.=
 Life isn't long enough for a detailed response. One point I think does need=
 making. Diane isn't indulging in anything like patriotic games when she say=
s, rather mildly, "It may be that Mr. Simic lacks the language skills to rea=
d Creeley=E2=80=B9and perhaps many other American poets. It is hard=E2=80=
=B9almost impossible--to hear all the layerings of meaning in any but your n=
ative tongue." She's merely noting that the acquisition of a native ear for=20=
all the subtlties of language and dialect is very rare after early childhood=
. One can write very well in the acquired language, of course, without that=20=
degree of awareness of the idiom, but even that's extremely rare.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I spent seven years working with Jose Kozer on the translation of his poems.=
 Jose has lived in a largely English-speaking environment since his 18th bir=
thday, and his English is articulate and virtually flawless, and barely acce=
nted. Nonetheless, he is aware that he has nothing like the depth of awarene=
ss of English that he has of Spanish. We often spent hours weighing the nuan=
ces of a Spanish word and the English approximations I planned to use, and h=
e was usually unaware of many of the nuances of the English.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Of the examples you give, Conrad never had to confront a poetry as subtle as=
 Creeley's, and Nabokov's taste in English-language poetry was decidedly con=
servative, almost Russian in its formalism. The foreigner's ear tends to ove=
rvalue the least subtle effects--those he or she can hear--in the new langua=
ge, which is why Dylan Thomas, for example, is much more popular among Spani=
sh-language poets than among anglophones and Lorca's ballads more popular am=
ong anglophones than the Walt Whitman or the Poet in New York. As to Kerouac=
, his early separation from English was nothing near as complete (nor as lon=
g-lasting) as Conrad's, Nabokov's, or Simic's.=C2=A0
=C2=A0
I don't think Simic's inability to hear what's going on in Creeley and a gre=
at deal of other US poetry is of this nature, though. He shares it with a lo=
t of native speakers.=C2=A0

Dear Friends of Small Press Traffic--

The 2007-2008 season has brought a lot of changes to SPT!  The
organization has a new Interim Director, several new hip and visionary
Board Members, a sparkling new look to our website
(www.sptraffic.org), and even new paypal buttons on our "supporters"
page.  Please also note our fairly new email address:
smallpresstraffic@gmail.com. With all of the changes, Small Press
Traffic is proud to continue its legacy as one of the oldest literary
arts centers on the West Coast.  We are as deeply committed as ever to
innovative writing and experimentation.  This has not changed in the
least.  But we need your help.

This fiscal year is a challenging one for us at SPT as certain grant
cycles require us to take a funding "year off."  Small Press Traffic
is a community based and supported organization and we need our
community just now.  So many poets we know have meant to join SPT,
have wanted to, but just didn't quite get around to it.  Now is the
time! In this off-budget year for SPT, your support makes a real
difference.

As a member of Small Press Traffic, you will receive free admission to
all of our events, as well as a subscription to Traffic, our fearless
and fabulous journal.  Plus your name will appear on our website and
in our nationally circulated fliers.  Please become a member, or renew
your membership today.  The first 50 people to join or renew will
receive archival broadsides from our vintage collection.  And it's so
easy.  Just visit http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm and
choose the amount you'd like to donate.  Please remember that your
contribution is tax-deductible and provides much needed funds for
SPT's new upcoming events, travel funds for writers, ground-breaking
symposia, and new equipment.

Thank you in advance for your support in this membership drive and for
making this one of SPT's best years yet!

See you Fridays,

Dana Teen Lomax
Interim Executive Director

David Buuck
Board President

Mark,

Diane is expressing a very old canard. I did not speak a word of English
until I was sixteen. I do not think that prevents me from writing what I
want in English or read what I want. In fact, in final analysis (look I
dropped my the) I find the bent in my hearing and the consciousness about
language this alienation has caused me a distinct advantage.

I do not know if you are aware of the number of major American poets whose
first/mother tongue was not English: Zukofsky, Stein, Williams, to name a
few.

One may definitely argue that to become an American poet the poet must
experience English as a foreign language; I explain this in detail in the
essay "Questions of Accent," where I also show how Creeley learns this
alienation from Zukofsky.

David, is a poet that different from an El Spontaneo, though to achieve tha=
t
freedom may take years?

Ciao,

Murat

Mark,
This is said in all friendliness and for the sake of
discussion, and I bear you only goodwill (saying that
just in case I sound wounding anywhere on accident),
but this is a very interesting issue to me, so here
goes.
You claim the widely-held opinion that a second
language cannot be "fully" acquired and mastered after
age 18, ie to a comparable level as the native tongue.
(I'm approximating your nuance to some extent, but
yours is a variant of the same view, which I've
usually heard or read with *much* younger ages, to
your credit: 12 or 15, eg).
The Creeley vs. Simic thing aside, I think this view
of second language acquisition (see below for your
quote) is a harmful received idea. There may be a very
minimal degree of biological accuracy, sure,
*perhaps*, but in that case maybe without much basis
in research (not that I've checked into that closely,
admittedly...).
I've spoken repeatedly with two specialists in applied
linguistics about this, in public and in private (one
an important scholar, -- and a chomskian, to boot!):
both agreed, this opinion about the limits of
linguistic mastery possible after puberty has no basis
in fact and is no more than widely assumed conjecture.
One of these specialists expressed slight scorn for
the notion, as a cliche accepted by people outside the
discipline.
More importantly, issues of language mastery are so
often used to dismiss or disparage "second-language"
writers (especially when language is doubled with
perceived racial difference), that this opinion is
best avoided. Who wants to adopt as their own the
opinions of the racist French (and elsewhere,
probably) editorial milieu? I think that's a
compelling reason to simply assume this idea about
language acquisition is false, or at least assume just
about *anything* before I assume a person has
imperfect mastery of a second language....
Accent, for example, is often a basis for such
judgments, but I've seen time and time again that the
extent of a second-language accent has no necessary
relation whatsoever to mastery of vocabulary, grammar,
expression written and oral, etc, etc....
Although I'll note that you don't think Simic's
problem is one of language acquisition, and I'm sure
you're right. You also base your opinion in personal
experience: I'm sure you're right in the cases you've
encountered, too. Furthermore, you do say "very rare"
rather than "never": but "very rare" is a slippery
word, and I would suggest rather too vague. What a
difficult thing to measure, after all!
Fascinating discussion, in any event.
Amicalement,
Alex

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.

2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally
solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

* About The City Visible:*

Edited by Ray Bianchi and William Allegrezza, this anthology brings togethe=
r
a sampling of some of the best poets working in Chicago and the surrounding
region. From all corners of the city, these poets are crafting a voice for
Chicago literature in the new century.

The book contains work from the following poets:

Jennifer Scappettone * Suzanne Buffam * Srikanth Reddy * Robyn Schiff * Nic=
k
Twemlow * John Tipton * Eric Elshtain * David Pavelich * Peter O'Leary *
William Fuller * Michael O'Leary * Mark Tardi * Erica Bernheim * Michael
Antonucci * Chris Glomski * Garin Cycholl * Luis Urrea * Kristy Odelius *
Lina Ramona Vitkauskas * Simone Muench * Lea Graham * Ed Roberson * Arielle
Greenberg * Tony Trigilio * Shin Yu Pai * Dan Beachy-Quick * Maxine Chernof=
f
* Kerri Sonnenberg * Jesse Seldess * Paul Hoover * Michelle Taransky *
Robert Archambeau * Bill Marsh * Larry Sawyer * Cecilia Pinto * Johanny
V=E1zquez Paz * Ela Kotkowska * Jorge Sanchez * Joel Craig * Daniel Borzutz=
ky
* Joel Felix * Raymond Bianchi * Cynthia Bond * William Allegrezza *
Jennifer Karmin * Tim Yu * Laura Sims * Roberto Harrison * Brenda C=E1rdena=
s *
Stacy Szymaszek * Chuck Stebelton * Jordan Stempleman.

*Praise for the Anthology:*

When Carl Sandburg asked in his *Chicago Poems*, close to a hundred years
ago, for "a voice to speak to me in the day end, / A hand to touch me in th=
e
dark room / Breaking the long loneliness," little did he know his city woul=
d
be so fully and livingly answered and so honored. Chicago is again
transformed by poetry. Here in these myriad acts of imagination, the poets
of T*he City Visible* give to it again, in Shakespeare's terms, :a local
habitation and a name."

Peter Gizzi

The most exciting and satisfying anthology I've acquired in the past month
is *The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century* . . . It not only
is easily the best anthology I've ever seen that tried to capture the livel=
y
scene of the Second City, but it's a worthy companion to Stephanie Young's =
*Bay
Poetics*, which for my money is the gold standard in contemporary poetry
anthologies, especially ones that offer a regional focus.

Ron Silliman

There's a lot of fantastic writing here . . . there s a diversity of
expression that makes it a fantastic sourcebook.

Simon DeDeo

*The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century* is a prudent
investment for any reader of contemporary poetry . . . the book is a nice,
hearty, earnest sampling of interesting poets.

Olivia Cronk, *Bookslut*

Unveiling an entire new poetic culture may seem like the act of a master
magician, but Allegrezza and Bianchi have been on the case a long time and
they know what they're doing. Volume Two is said to be in the works, and in
the meantime I for one will be ordering several copies of Volume One for
students, friends, and family relations. When young poets ask me, where
should I go, what should I do, nowadays I always say pull out a map, throw
in a dart. X marks the spot, but Chicago is the most exciting scene around.
Years from now we'll be looking back at the early 21st century and wishing
we'd all relocated there at this time in poetry history.

             Kevin Killian

Bill Allegrezza

p.s. My list is not large, so feel free to forward this to poets you know,
especially poets in Chicago.

Knowing more than one language at an early age is=20

Yes, I think it's time to see bilingual ism (or tri plus) as a rich advantage for a poem/poet - and, also, a genuine mirror of the global space in which multiple languages are intersecting and modifying each other more than ever.
 I find odd (if not silly) - if that is what Diane and Mark are really saying -  the idea that Charles Simic cannot really hear and write with a full knowledge of English  subtleties, nuances, etc. (I think he came here in high school by the way).
The limits - when Simic comes to reading Creeley -  should be just pointed out as that. Dipping into an "English first" bias can be interpreted/seen as an ethnocentric bias at the root of too many other issues.

 I think it's time - and this will become more frequent in generations to come - that the work of a bi-lingual poet such a Victor Hernandez Cruz will become "the norm" - where his Spanish via Puerto-Rico and English via this country find real interesting collisions and juxtapositions. (I happen to think that fully bilingual poets/writers can bring more strategies to the table).

 What if WCW and Zukofsky - for example - had written in forms that had combined both of their languages. I am sure this notion of such combinations will be anathema to various forms of gated communities (intellectual and otherwise) in the US and elsewhere. And not the coming adventure - particularly as USA hegemony begins to disintegrate, global migrations expand and English becomes much more subtle and variant.  Of course, in the struggle to preserve or create 'new standards' these changes will be madly resisted, fought over, etc.  That, too, will be part of the adventure.

Diane is expressing a very old canard. I did not speak a word of English
until I was sixteen. I do not think that prevents me from writing what I
want in English or read what I want. In fact, in final analysis (look I
dropped my the) I find the bent in my hearing and the consciousness about
language this alienation has caused me a distinct advantage.

I do not know if you are aware of the number of major American poets whose
first/mother tongue was not English: Zukofsky, Stein, Williams, to name a
few.

One may definitely argue that to become an American poet the poet must
experience English as a foreign language; I explain this in detail in the
essay "Questions of Accent," where I also show how Creeley learns this
alienation from Zukofsky.

David, is a poet that different from an El Spontaneo, though to achieve that
freedom may take years?

Whoa! I'm with you all along, and then you blow it with "the racist French"--which suddenly sounds like the pot calling the kettle black, if you know what I mean. Where did this heinous stereotyping of a people come from? If you are American, in particular--as I am--you have no right to fob this off on anyone else. After all, how much racism have we spewed into the world?

This is said in all friendliness and for the sake of
discussion, and I bear you only goodwill (saying that
just in case I sound wounding anywhere on accident),
but this is a very interesting issue to me, so here
goes.
You claim the widely-held opinion that a second
language cannot be "fully" acquired and mastered after
age 18, ie to a comparable level as the native tongue.
(I'm approximating your nuance to some extent, but
yours is a variant of the same view, which I've
usually heard or read with *much* younger ages, to
your credit: 12 or 15, eg).
The Creeley vs. Simic thing aside, I think this view
of second language acquisition (see below for your
quote) is a harmful received idea. There may be a very
minimal degree of biological accuracy, sure,
*perhaps*, but in that case maybe without much basis
in research (not that I've checked into that closely,
admittedly...).
I've spoken repeatedly with two specialists in applied
linguistics about this, in public and in private (one
an important scholar, -- and a chomskian, to boot!):
both agreed, this opinion about the limits of
linguistic mastery possible after puberty has no basis
in fact and is no more than widely assumed conjecture.
One of these specialists expressed slight scorn for
the notion, as a cliche accepted by people outside the
discipline.
More importantly, issues of language mastery are so
often used to dismiss or disparage "second-language"
writers (especially when language is doubled with
perceived racial difference), that this opinion is
best avoided. Who wants to adopt as their own the
opinions of the racist French (and elsewhere,
probably) editorial milieu? I think that's a
compelling reason to simply assume this idea about
language acquisition is false, or at least assume just
about *anything* before I assume a person has
imperfect mastery of a second language....
Accent, for example, is often a basis for such
judgments, but I've seen time and time again that the
extent of a second-language accent has no necessary
relation whatsoever to mastery of vocabulary, grammar,
expression written and oral, etc, etc....
Although I'll note that you don't think Simic's
problem is one of language acquisition, and I'm sure
you're right. You also base your opinion in personal
experience: I'm sure you're right in the cases you've
encountered, too. Furthermore, you do say "very rare"
rather than "never": but "very rare" is a slippery
word, and I would suggest rather too vague. What a
difficult thing to measure, after all!
Fascinating discussion, in any event.
Amicalement,
Alex

Alex:

I have friends who are truly bilingual. All of=20
them were raised in environments where two=20
languages were spoken, whether at home or in the=20
streets. I've noticed young children in bilingual=20
environments who speak one language to their=20
mothers and another to their fathers. I've asked=20
bilingual adults about their memories of early=20
childhood speech--how they conceptual;ized their=20
bilingualism at that age. They've all told me the=20
same thing--they simply spoke the appropriate=20
language, French, say, to daddy, english to=20
mommy, without really conceptualizing them as=20
different languages, much as one learns early to=20
speak the same language differently to one's=20
parents and to one's playmates. I see this all=20
the time in my largely Spanish-speaking neighborhood, by the way.

I also have a great many friends who approach=20
bilinguality but come from monolingual=20
backgrounds. They drive me wild with envy. They=20
have a degree of linguistic talent that I simply=20
don't have. Many of them are professional=20
translators. None of them have claimed to me to=20
be fully bilingual--the second language remains a=20
learned entity, and they remain conscious of that fact.

Think of it this way. I actively remember the=20
early acquisition of only a couple of non-learned=20
words in English. Those words are forever=20
associated with a place and a time. In French and=20
Spanish there are a great many such words. I may=20
not think about their origins for me very often,=20
but I do when I find myself using them with the=20
person from whom I learned them. Which for a=20
moment bifurcates my apprehension of the language=20
in a way particular to that kind of encounter.

Here's another. I am far from bilingual. My=20
Hebrew has almost completely fallen away, my=20
French is a bit better than "practical" and my=20
Spanish less so (though I read fluently in both=20
the latter). At one point, when I was living in=20
France, I hoped that I might become something=20
closer to bilingual. I realized the limits of=20
that possibility when I spoke to children or=20
overheard adolescents. On those occasions I was=20
reminded that I would never be anything like an=20
unconscious speaker of the babytalk or adolescent=20
cant appropriate to my generation. I would also=20
never have the associational vocabulary that=20
indicates the parents' or grandparents'=20
generation, nor the emotional response to same.=20
With an effort I could learn them as a stranger=20
(and as a translator I have had to learn some of=20
this), but it would never become familiar, unconscious usage.

On one occasion I was walking through the East=20
Village with two visiting French friends. They=20
had been a couple for a long time. One of them=20
suddenly began to speak a language I'd never=20
heard before. The other answered. The saw my=20
surprise, and explained. It was verlan, the=20
French piglatin of their generation, now somewhat pass=E9, I'm told.

None of this means that one can't learn a=20
profound degree of competence in a new language.=20
It does suggest that what one learns isn't a=20
native's competence. It's a difference, but in no=20
way a disqualification. Looked at closely enough,=20
we each speak our unique dialect, which contains=20
more than enough to meet whatever needs we imagine for it.

  Nick Twemlow – Robyn Schiff – Johanny Vázquez Paz – Joel Felix – Peter O’Leary – Garin Cycholl – Chris Glomski – Simone Muench – Cynthia Bond – Kristy Odelius – Lina Vitkauskas – Larry Sawyer – William Allegrezza – Jorge Sanchez – Tony Trigilio – Jennifer Karmin – Ray Bianchi – Kerri Sonnenberg – Eric Elshtain

For more information, contact editor@crackedslabbooks.com or call 312-342-7337.   For the book, see crackedslabbooks.com or visit amazon.com.

About The City Visible:
  Edited by Ray Bianchi and William Allegrezza, this anthology brings together a sampling of some of the best poets working in Chicago and the surrounding region. From all corners of the city, these poets are crafting a voice for Chicago literature in the new century.
  The book contains work from the following poets:
  Jennifer Scappettone * Suzanne Buffam * Srikanth Reddy * Robyn Schiff * Nick Twemlow * John Tipton * Eric Elshtain * David Pavelich * Peter O’Leary * William Fuller * Michael O’Leary * Mark Tardi * Erica Bernheim * Michael Antonucci * Chris Glomski * Garin Cycholl * Luis Urrea * Kristy Odelius * Lina Ramona Vitkauskas * Simone Muench * Lea Graham * Ed Roberson * Arielle Greenberg * Tony Trigilio * Shin Yu Pai * Dan Beachy-Quick * Maxine Chernoff * Kerri Sonnenberg * Jesse Seldess * Paul Hoover * Michelle Taransky * Robert Archambeau * Bill Marsh * Larry Sawyer * Cecilia Pinto * Johanny Vázquez Paz * Ela Kotkowska * Jorge Sanchez * Joel Craig * Daniel Borzutzky * Joel Felix * Raymond Bianchi * Cynthia Bond * William Allegrezza * Jennifer Karmin * Tim Yu * Laura Sims * Roberto Harrison * Brenda Cárdenas * Stacy Szymaszek * Chuck Stebelton * Jordan Stempleman.
  Praise for the Anthology:
  When Carl Sandburg asked in his Chicago Poems, close to a hundred years ago, for "a voice to speak to me in the day end, / A hand to touch me in the dark room / Breaking the long loneliness," little did he know his city would be so fully and livingly answered and so honored. Chicago is again transformed by poetry. Here in these myriad acts of imagination, the poets of The City Visible give to it again, in Shakespeare's terms, :a local habitation and a name."
  Peter Gizzi
  The most exciting and satisfying anthology I’ve acquired in the past month is The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century . . . It not only is easily the best anthology I’ve ever seen that tried to capture the lively scene of the Second City, but it’s a worthy companion to Stephanie Young’s Bay Poetics, which for my money is the gold standard in contemporary poetry anthologies, especially ones that offer a regional focus.
  Ron Silliman
  There's a lot of fantastic writing here . . . there s a diversity of expression that makes it a fantastic sourcebook.
  Simon DeDeo
  The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century is a prudent investment for any reader of contemporary poetry . . . the book is a nice, hearty, earnest sampling of interesting poets.
  Olivia Cronk, Bookslut

  Unveiling an entire new poetic culture may seem like the act of a master magician, but Allegrezza and Bianchi have been on the case a long time and they know what they're doing. Volume Two is said to be in the works, and in the meantime I for one will be ordering several copies of Volume One for students, friends, and family relations. When young poets ask me, where should I go, what should I do, nowadays I always say pull out a map, throw in a dart. X marks the spot, but Chicago is the most exciting scene around. Years from now we'll be looking back at the early 21st century and wishing we'd all relocated there at this time in poetry history.

Our submission period has reopened as of the beginning of September. We
would love to read work that uses constraints, innovative meter and form, or
carefully executed collage/cut-up techniques. We welcome submissions of both
poetry and prose (or anything in between), and we are particularly
interested in reading prose submissions for our next issue (ideally of under
1,000 words). See our submission guidelines for more details:

      Forgive essaying to respond to three threads at once, yet i
think they are interrelated in very interesting ways.  (I won/t be
bale to them justice here, but an essay at a start--)
       Language can play very strange roles in its vaga-bondage from
the throat and fingers into the "aires" or "errors" heard by ears or
errers, and by the I/eye that reads the notations of its reeds.
         When i was sixteen i was living in the streets, parks and
abandoned buildings in Paris and for a brief spell with a tiny
Anarchist cell of workers at the Renault factory. After some
operations of the "propaganda of the deed" on unguarded empty police
vans we split up and i was back to living here and there.  Often there
would be many young people from various countries sleeping in a park,
or even just eating in a park, and the police would come through and
arrest as many as they could.  It's thanks to the police a lifelong
education began in questions of  identity, "profiling," handwriting,
finger printing, surveillance photos having to do with language,
whether it's one's first or second, let alone those of which William
S.  Burroughs notes in the Preface to Junkie, "a final glossary,
therefore,  cannot be made of words whose intentions are fugitive."
          Alex Dickow made a very important point--that it is not only
the accent which goes into speaking and writing a language in essaying
to learn it, it is many other things which constitute a mosaic-like
surface which in turn has to have when tested beneath this
"camouflaging" as it were the depths and contours of first a relief,
and, if that is  discovered, still another level of depths which flow
into the subconscious areas of involuntary memories and dreams.  Once
a language has begun to be dreamed in, and have involuntary memories
recalled through, it begins to manifest itself in the outward gestures
and expressions, body language, intonations and inflections, which one
begins "living out" when speaking and writing.
     And to go even further into these dreams and memories as well as
in waking consciousness, there is the growing frequency of bi-lingual
(or tri-lingual and more)  punnings and neologisms, collaged and
montaged visual/soundscapes that one finds keep turning up  "all over
the place" day and night. Arriving in this area, one begins to realize
a proliferation and loosening of "identity" not only in terms of
language but of body language as well. In a sense, one has achieved
the potential if not the existence, really, of being a "double agent."
      As usual with language of any kind, "doubling" is at the very
least a "two edged sword."  This "doubled agency" can be very
liberating and also very "suspicious," even imprisoning, depending on
the  people, places and things one encounters and is involved with.
One minute it's "double your pleasure,/double your fun/when you are
chewing/doublemint gum," and the next it's "where the dangers are
double/and the pleasures are few/where it's dark as the dungeon/and
damp as the dew."
   I had only been learning French for a bit less than two years, part
of that while living there and part from movies and books.  (I had
gone to Paris to be at the Cinematheque as much as possible;  at the
time it was the only place to be for the cine-possesed.) It had by
then entered dream and memory and been making the bi-lingual puns, and
without realizing it had transformed one physically when speaking.
The police, ever guardians of the "prison house(s) of language(s)"
immediately were suspicious.  They asserted my american passport was
either forged or stolen and turned me over to the CRS para-military
political police.  That was to be the first of a number of nightmarish
times with them.  Many of them were Algerian War veterans and into
torture, brutality, inflicting many injuries, some  that have never
completely healed.   Yet one didn't get beaten to death like an Arab
in an adjoining cell, whose "crime" was thinking himself really a
French citizen as his papers said he was.
      One time i was walking down the street and saw some people with
a table and literature.  A man came up to me and said--"You're Breton,
aren't you?"  Some of my ancestors were from there, but had arrived in
Quebec in 1650.  Well--i must learn about the Breton Liberation Front,
then, right?  A pleasant afternoon learning about this and helping
handout leaflets and pamphlets.  The next time arrested, the police
showed me a foto in which there i was, a "member" of the Liberation
Front.   This time it was "association with a group against the
Republic" and this led to another one later, charged with 'terrorism,"
 ironic considering the Anarchist events were never traced.
        When I went to England with my brother some months later, they
didn't believe the passport either.  I was put in a detention cell in
the ferry and given a whole battery of English language tests, very
fast--oral, written, reading.  Then asked for plane ticket return,
travelers' cheques,  and addresses of friends going to visit.  My
brother had no such problem.  He had been living and working in
Ticino, so wasn't dressed and didn't act the same way.  Oddlly, they
believed he was an American (though he looked like an Ticinese
peasant) and said,  besides you don't look like brothers.  Ten years
later when I went to England again, a variation of the same things
occurred.  (In between these visits  had read Henry Miller's account
of his unpleasant encounter with the British authorities.)
      Similar events followed me across Europe over several trips, the
most complicated one, too long to tell here, involved house arrest in
Poland and appearance before a military court.
      In every case, no matter the documentation, the charge involved
at the minimum forged passport and maximum such dangerous ones as
suspicion of terrorism, suspicion of espionage.  It didn't matter that
in some countries one didn't know the language at all.  Body language
and behaviour was what "told the truth."   One had become, in effect,
via bi-linguism, a life long double agent apparently.
      This sort of thing once started never seems to stop and has
followed me to Canada and in the USA.  Not suspicion of crimes, other
than simply not being American.  "Where are you really from, Dave,"
said the officer recently investigating what i was doing while working
on some pieces at a site.  "The squad car computer 's  says you're an
American.  You sure about that?  Not pulling my leg, now, are you?"
      In a funny way, this makes one wonder if one's first language
isn't a foreign one, and from there one goes into the sense of
doubling being at the pulsing heart of any language one encounters.
Years of being involved in other areas of existence only further this,
where indeed the fugitive words and incomplete glossaries that
Burroughs notes, become as much as a part of one's awareness and being
as the standardized versions of language one encounters when not among
fellow speakers of the others.  This is one among many other reasons
that i write of my works that they are involved with what is hidden in
plain site/sight/cite. The world one moves in is not simply
bi-lingual, but many, many lingual, though many of the langauges are
of necessity fragmentary, fugitive, in continual flux among the
ongoing flow of al that is. One adapts to a chamelon form of existence
in movements and words, images and sounds, gestures, vocabularies,
grammers that shift with the persons one deals with at any given time
of the day or night.
        Walking down a street one watches shadows, reflections for a
much wider multi-angled many-eyed as it were point of view.  The same
operates sonically, attuned to echoes to judge distances of others
from oneself, of buildings not yet seen lying ahead or where the
openings of alleys are in the darkest night.  In this way I began
working much more with learning to see when working via the touch, the
hands, and training the eyes to be able to feel textures when barely
enough illumination is present.  Languages found in darkness among the
unseen things reveberate through the nerves of the fingers to the
mind's throat.
      All of these lessons one brings to "language" and so one sees
and hears in language so much that those who use it are unaware of
themselves. (And never let oneself think that is one is "completely
aware," of even  but a small part of it at all either.) Thus, a person
who knows a number of languages may well hear in one of them things
that are unheard by those who are limited to that  one language only.
      That is, if one is seeing and listening and touching in as many
ways possible to learn just what it is in the continual arrangements
of particles what constitutes at any given moment the "language
situation," it is often not at all as it appears to be, presents
itself to be, or thinks itself to be. Areas of the muffling and
deadening or almost complete muteness of language open up, and in them
one finds that it is possible that the images of the world so to speak
become altered and deformed in a myriad ways.
     So much of what is taken to be the "facts of the matter,"
"time-tested truths", al the rest of it, are dependent on the willing
suspension of disbelief. Complete fabrications, outright lies,
deliberate dis-translations, plagiarized "originality," the smear, the
rumor, the plant, the carefully constructed claims of authority, the
forgery, the doctored tapes, fotos, videos,   the fool's gold are all
absolutely essential to the "truth" on which is built "order,"
"security," "threat," "the market," "freedom," "history," and the rest
of the gigantic Language which shoves people about and forces most of
them into hells on earth.  Every thing must be done to protect and
preserve the "willing suspension of disbelief" that is taken to be the
 "clear" "reasonable" thinking of the "well-informed citizen."
          The Gazas, Green Zones, Gated Communities of the world are
in the early stages of their developments in terms of the
architectures of security, surveillance, censorship, the making
completely visible within contained areas of persons who are
simultaneously kept invisible to the outside world.  (England is also
developing this to extreme degrees. And the new Boeing and
subcontracted Israeli firms Border Fence to be erected all along the
border of the USA and Mexico will be for a while the "showstopper.")
      Confinement on a grand scale becomes the new form, the black
hole, into which vanish peoples from history. The erasure is  further
carried out by language.  To eradicate languages is to cut off their
dreamings, their involuntary memories, their ghostly presences.  Even
to begin simply with methods of dis-translation, censorings, bannings,
falsifications or forgeries and the rest of the bag of tricks, is to
begin the work of expunging this existence of a language, of many many
languages. And not only "foreign" languages, but one's "own" language.
 Dreamings, desires, behaviours, can slowly be disposed of by the
continual work done on the fictions taken as facts and truths.
Languages of liberation turn quickly into those of the prison, the
torture chamber, the "disappeared."
The "=" sign in "Language" poetry can become pretty fast barbed wire.
And why not?  Does it not also need to preserve and protect, become
its own gated community in turn? Is this not why the "English official
language" movement is such a well funded one?  Or the reason only
certain forms of writing and reading  are taught as the "correct" or
the "resistant" ones?
              In a bizzare way, a great deal of effort is put into
simulating in language things which the simulators wittingly or not
are complicit in forcing upon others to live-- and a great many of
these themselves denied literacy, a nice touch!
     Language is to be "ruptured,"  "disrupted," "fragmented,"
"chaotic," "Meaningless," to undergo "chance" operations,
 to be given the variety of non-translation methods of translation one
can find in various lists of writing exercises, to be subjected to
"shocks," to be "interrogated," to be in short experimented upon in
the ways a great many persons are.  The benefit of this to the
experimenters is (supposed to be) that there will be the realization
in "form" of what is taeken to be "radical," and "resistant" to the
System.  This is all very much to the benefit of the System, however,
for it gives the "willing suspension of disbelief" its raison
d'etre--the creation of a fiction of resistance, while the System uses
these similarly named methodologies on persons who are in fact
"resistant."
       The set-up is dependent on there being one "National" language,
one  conception of Language, one form of "language poetry,""language
of poetry," "poetical language" and the like.
        Paradoxically, the more that there is this "Oneness," the more
there is the proliferation of the rubble, the waste, the debris, the
broken, the demolished, the rusted, the "useless,"created by its
brutal "construction of the New, the 'post'" "condition."  For all the
cleaning,  cleanliness and cleansing  imposed, there is ever more of
the dirty piling up all around one hidden in plain site/sight/cite.
      More and more of the peoples of the world live in these refuse
heaps, the "planet of slums" as Mike Davis calls it in a book of that
name, learning to exist on rubble. "How picturesque,"  "how admirable
the human spirit," say the fotos and captions of a current series in
the NY Times for example. "Tourism in other people's misery," as the
Situationists aptly described it.
     Yet, "Necessity is the motherfucker of invention," one sings to
oneself among the overlooked alleys and dirty bits and pieces of
letterings and forms, and in this already polyglot, already
fragmented, ruptured, thrown away, shell shocked, disaster shocked
refuse is where is found the seeds with which to refuse this gigantic
monomaniacal mono-linguism of simulations and controls.   One learns
among these sites/sights/cites refused further utility that there is
indeed the "utility of uselessness," for in the paradox of being thus
hidden, they have endured and still carry within them the languages of
dreams, involuntary memories, ghostly presences, the elements of
rhizomatic languages which, being fugitive, are not part of a complete
or ever to be completed glossary, never to be compiled and "contained"
within
 any one book, any two covers, any one language, any one system.
        From that necessity comes the discipline through practice of
finding the improvised  leap of many El Spontaneos into the ring where
not only the real bulls are encountered, but the rituals, languages,
organizings of the spectacle of Death.  Prepared by necessity, myriad
tongued motherfucker of invention, can not the El Spontaneos
improvize the myriad gestures, songs, movements of a refusal of this
spectacle?  And in so doing provide a myriad of examples of refusals
from which to take elements to continue the inventions of refusals?
        Marcel Duchamp introduced the world to the "ready-made."
Extending his thought further, one finds oneself working with the
ready-refuse. All around one, hidden in plain site,sight, cite--the
polyglot refus-sings.
         The ballads of Villon can be heard in all this refuse,  in
the  Medieval art of necessity still in existence today of "les
Glaneurs," "The Gleaners." (btw this is the name of a very great film
by Agnes Varda on this topic)
        I do not think one ever attains what is called "competence" in
any language without in some degree becoming "incompetent" in a
language of living. It is the necessity of living itself that exposes
to one the findings of languages in their multitudes among which one
may learn to work with basic elements to be opening outwo/ards into
and with othernesses.
      "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."--Paul Celan
       "I do not seek, I find"--Pablo Picasso    (both of them polyglots)

You've got to become more self-aware, David, and a better actor, or you're
going to have this kind of trouble all the time. Part of the charm of the double
or triple or whateverple life is learning to fool the authorities.

bait life blog more

do not look close
your stinky heart rots
curtains of iron
made of water
everyone knows
you do not exist
except to crush good
destroy into broken pieces
orbing wildly in your mind
tender innocense scorched

blogs are anonymous
whispers that judge
what is unknown

never under cover
evaporate light
destroy good
flash burn
frozen solid
heart weeps
bullets

blogs are a social media
which is why i am both attracted to and repelled by them.

people annoy me and so do their blogs, yet i remain transfixed.

Dear Friends=20

I want to thank you for your very interesting input.

This is the first time since joining the list that I have engaged in
anything close to a =B3real=B2 discussion, voiced anything close to a small
slice of my real thoughts and opinions, and I=B9ve learned a lot. What I
learned first of all is that I certainly won=B9t send my piece, nor any
similar piece, to NYRB or anywhere else. And I remembered again how utterly
pointless opinions=8Bmine or anyone else=B9s=8Btruly are.

For me, the heart of the matter is the poem. At my age I can ill afford to
be drawn into discussions which steal many hours from the work at hand. As
for my friends and other poets, living and dead, time will sort out whose
work matters=8Bno way any of us can know anything about that right now.
(Remember Robert Southey was Poet Laureate of England while Wordsworth and
Coleridge, Shelley and Keats, were alive.)

Even more compelling to me is the consideration that as a Buddhist I long
ago made a commitment not to contribute in any way to discord within the
sangha=8Band the poetry community most certainly is a sangha=8Bit=B9s meaningless
if it=B9s not that. I had hoped that I was writing without animosity or
stridency, but I seem to have stirred up both.

This in itself is reason enough for me to =B3shut up and listen=B2, which is my
plan at this time.=20

Thanks again.

Diane di Prima

Subject: El Spontaneo/Villon/Language acquisition

      Forgive essaying to respond to three threads at once, yet i
think they are interrelated in very interesting ways.  (I won/t be
bale to them justice here, but an essay at a start--)
       Language can play very strange roles in its vaga-bondage from
the throat and fingers into the "aires" or "errors" heard by ears or
errers, and by the I/eye that reads the notations of its reeds.
         When i was sixteen i was living in the streets, parks and
abandoned buildings in Paris and for a brief spell with a tiny
Anarchist cell of workers at the Renault factory. After some
operations of the "propaganda of the deed" on unguarded empty police
vans we split up and i was back to living here and there.  Often there
would be many young people from various countries sleeping in a park,
or even just eating in a park, and the police would come through and
arrest as many as they could.  It's thanks to the police a lifelong
education began in questions of  identity, "profiling," handwriting,
finger printing, surveillance photos having to do with language,
whether it's one's first or second, let alone those of which William
S.  Burroughs notes in the Preface to Junkie, "a final glossary,
therefore,  cannot be made of words whose intentions are fugitive."
          Alex Dickow made a very important point--that it is not only
the accent which goes into speaking and writing a language in essaying
to learn it, it is many other things which constitute a mosaic-like
surface which in turn has to have when tested beneath this
"camouflaging" as it were the depths and contours of first a relief,
and, if that is  discovered, still another level of depths which flow
into the subconscious areas of involuntary memories and dreams.  Once
a language has begun to be dreamed in, and have involuntary memories
recalled through, it begins to manifest itself in the outward gestures
and expressions, body language, intonations and inflections, which one
begins "living out" when speaking and writing.
     And to go even further into these dreams and memories as well as
in waking consciousness, there is the growing frequency of bi-lingual
(or tri-lingual and more)  punnings and neologisms, collaged and
montaged visual/soundscapes that one finds keep turning up  "all over
the place" day and night. Arriving in this area, one begins to realize
a proliferation and loosening of "identity" not only in terms of
language but of body language as well. In a sense, one has achieved
the potential if not the existence, really, of being a "double agent."
      As usual with language of any kind, "doubling" is at the very
least a "two edged sword."  This "doubled agency" can be very
liberating and also very "suspicious," even imprisoning, depending on
the  people, places and things one encounters and is involved with.
One minute it's "double your pleasure,/double your fun/when you are
chewing/doublemint gum," and the next it's "where the dangers are
double/and the pleasures are few/where it's dark as the dungeon/and
damp as the dew."
   I had only been learning French for a bit less than two years, part
of that while living there and part from movies and books.  (I had
gone to Paris to be at the Cinematheque as much as possible;  at the
time it was the only place to be for the cine-possesed.) It had by
then entered dream and memory and been making the bi-lingual puns, and
without realizing it had transformed one physically when speaking.
The police, ever guardians of the "prison house(s) of language(s)"
immediately were suspicious.  They asserted my american passport was
either forged or stolen and turned me over to the CRS para-military
political police.  That was to be the first of a number of nightmarish
times with them.  Many of them were Algerian War veterans and into
torture, brutality, inflicting many injuries, some  that have never
completely healed.   Yet one didn't get beaten to death like an Arab
in an adjoining cell, whose "crime" was thinking himself really a
French citizen as his papers said he was.
      One time i was walking down the street and saw some people with
a table and literature.  A man came up to me and said--"You're Breton,
aren't you?"  Some of my ancestors were from there, but had arrived in
Quebec in 1650.  Well--i must learn about the Breton Liberation Front,
then, right?  A pleasant afternoon learning about this and helping
handout leaflets and pamphlets.  The next time arrested, the police
showed me a foto in which there i was, a "member" of the Liberation
Front.   This time it was "association with a group against the
Republic" and this led to another one later, charged with 'terrorism,"
 ironic considering the Anarchist events were never traced.
        When I went to England with my brother some months later, they
didn't believe the passport either.  I was put in a detention cell in
the ferry and given a whole battery of English language tests, very
fast--oral, written, reading.  Then asked for plane ticket return,
travelers' cheques,  and addresses of friends going to visit.  My
brother had no such problem.  He had been living and working in
Ticino, so wasn't dressed and didn't act the same way.  Oddlly, they
believed he was an American (though he looked like an Ticinese
peasant) and said,  besides you don't look like brothers.  Ten years
later when I went to England again, a variation of the same things
occurred.  (In between these visits  had read Henry Miller's account
of his unpleasant encounter with the British authorities.)
      Similar events followed me across Europe over several trips, the
most complicated one, too long to tell here, involved house arrest in
Poland and appearance before a military court.
      In every case, no matter the documentation, the charge involved
at the minimum forged passport and maximum such dangerous ones as
suspicion of terrorism, suspicion of espionage.  It didn't matter that
in some countries one didn't know the language at all.  Body language
and behaviour was what "told the truth."   One had become, in effect,
via bi-linguism, a life long double agent apparently.
      This sort of thing once started never seems to stop and has
followed me to Canada and in the USA.  Not suspicion of crimes, other
than simply not being American.  "Where are you really from, Dave,"
said the officer recently investigating what i was doing while working
on some pieces at a site.  "The squad car computer 's  says you're an
American.  You sure about that?  Not pulling my leg, now, are you?"
      In a funny way, this makes one wonder if one's first language
isn't a foreign one, and from there one goes into the sense of
doubling being at the pulsing heart of any language one encounters.
Years of being involved in other areas of existence only further this,
where indeed the fugitive words and incomplete glossaries that
Burroughs notes, become as much as a part of one's awareness and being
as the standardized versions of language one encounters when not among
fellow speakers of the others.  This is one among many other reasons
that i write of my works that they are involved with what is hidden in
plain site/sight/cite. The world one moves in is not simply
bi-lingual, but many, many lingual, though many of the langauges are
of necessity fragmentary, fugitive, in continual flux among the
ongoing flow of al that is. One adapts to a chamelon form of existence
in movements and words, images and sounds, gestures, vocabularies,
grammers that shift with the persons one deals with at any given time
of the day or night.
        Walking down a street one watches shadows, reflections for a
much wider multi-angled many-eyed as it were point of view.  The same
operates sonically, attuned to echoes to judge distances of others
from oneself, of buildings not yet seen lying ahead or where the
openings of alleys are in the darkest night.  In this way I began
working much more with learning to see when working via the touch, the
hands, and training the eyes to be able to feel textures when barely
enough illumination is present.  Languages found in darkness among the
unseen things reveberate through the nerves of the fingers to the
mind's throat.
      All of these lessons one brings to "language" and so one sees
and hears in language so much that those who use it are unaware of
themselves. (And never let oneself think that is one is "completely
aware," of even  but a small part of it at all either.) Thus, a person
who knows a number of languages may well hear in one of them things
that are unheard by those who are limited to that  one language only.
      That is, if one is seeing and listening and touching in as many
ways possible to learn just what it is in the continual arrangements
of particles what constitutes at any given moment the "language
situation," it is often not at all as it appears to be, presents
itself to be, or thinks itself to be. Areas of the muffling and
deadening or almost complete muteness of language open up, and in them
one finds that it is possible that the images of the world so to speak
become altered and deformed in a myriad ways.
     So much of what is taken to be the "facts of the matter,"
"time-tested truths", al the rest of it, are dependent on the willing
suspension of disbelief. Complete fabrications, outright lies,
deliberate dis-translations, plagiarized "originality," the smear, the
rumor, the plant, the carefully constructed claims of authority, the
forgery, the doctored tapes, fotos, videos,   the fool's gold are all
absolutely essential to the "truth" on which is built "order,"
"security," "threat," "the market," "freedom," "history," and the rest
of the gigantic Language which shoves people about and forces most of
them into hells on earth.  Every thing must be done to protect and
preserve the "willing suspension of disbelief" that is taken to be the
 "clear" "reasonable" thinking of the "well-informed citizen."
          The Gazas, Green Zones, Gated Communities of the world are
in the early stages of their developments in terms of the
architectures of security, surveillance, censorship, the making
completely visible within contained areas of persons who are
simultaneously kept invisible to the outside world.  (England is also
developing this to extreme degrees. And the new Boeing and
subcontracted Israeli firms Border Fence to be erected all along the
border of the USA and Mexico will be for a while the "showstopper.")
      Confinement on a grand scale becomes the new form, the black
hole, into which vanish peoples from history. The erasure is  further
carried out by language.  To eradicate languages is to cut off their
dreamings, their involuntary memories, their ghostly presences.  Even
to begin simply with methods of dis-translation, censorings, bannings,
falsifications or forgeries and the rest of the bag of tricks, is to
begin the work of expunging this existence of a language, of many many
languages. And not only "foreign" languages, but one's "own" language.
 Dreamings, desires, behaviours, can slowly be disposed of by the
continual work done on the fictions taken as facts and truths.
Languages of liberation turn quickly into those of the prison, the
torture chamber, the "disappeared."
The "=3D" sign in "Language" poetry can become pretty fast barbed wire.
And why not?  Does it not also need to preserve and protect, become
its own gated community in turn? Is this not why the "English official
language" movement is such a well funded one?  Or the reason only
certain forms of writing and reading  are taught as the "correct" or
the "resistant" ones?
              In a bizzare way, a great deal of effort is put into
simulating in language things which the simulators wittingly or not
are complicit in forcing upon others to live-- and a great many of
these themselves denied literacy, a nice touch!
     Language is to be "ruptured,"  "disrupted," "fragmented,"
"chaotic," "Meaningless," to undergo "chance" operations,
 to be given the variety of non-translation methods of translation one
can find in various lists of writing exercises, to be subjected to
"shocks," to be "interrogated," to be in short experimented upon in
the ways a great many persons are.  The benefit of this to the
experimenters is (supposed to be) that there will be the realization
in "form" of what is taeken to be "radical," and "resistant" to the
System.  This is all very much to the benefit of the System, however,
for it gives the "willing suspension of disbelief" its raison
d'etre--the creation of a fiction of resistance, while the System uses
these similarly named methodologies on persons who are in fact
"resistant."
       The set-up is dependent on there being one "National" language,
one  conception of Language, one form of "language poetry,""language
of poetry," "poetical language" and the like.
        Paradoxically, the more that there is this "Oneness," the more
there is the proliferation of the rubble, the waste, the debris, the
broken, the demolished, the rusted, the "useless,"created by its
brutal "construction of the New, the 'post'" "condition."  For all the
cleaning,  cleanliness and cleansing  imposed, there is ever more of
the dirty piling up all around one hidden in plain site/sight/cite.
      More and more of the peoples of the world live in these refuse
heaps, the "planet of slums" as Mike Davis calls it in a book of that
name, learning to exist on rubble. "How picturesque,"  "how admirable
the human spirit," say the fotos and captions of a current series in
the NY Times for example. "Tourism in other people's misery," as the
Situationists aptly described it.
     Yet, "Necessity is the motherfucker of invention," one sings to
oneself among the overlooked alleys and dirty bits and pieces of
letterings and forms, and in this already polyglot, already
fragmented, ruptured, thrown away, shell shocked, disaster shocked
refuse is where is found the seeds with which to refuse this gigantic
monomaniacal mono-linguism of simulations and controls.   One learns
among these sites/sights/cites refused further utility that there is
indeed the "utility of uselessness," for in the paradox of being thus
hidden, they have endured and still carry within them the languages of
dreams, involuntary memories, ghostly presences, the elements of
rhizomatic languages which, being fugitive, are not part of a complete
or ever to be completed glossary, never to be compiled and "contained"
within
 any one book, any two covers, any one language, any one system.
        From that necessity comes the discipline through practice of
finding the improvised  leap of many El Spontaneos into the ring where
not only the real bulls are encountered, but the rituals, languages,
organizings of the spectacle of Death.  Prepared by necessity, myriad
tongued motherfucker of invention, can not the El Spontaneos
improvize the myriad gestures, songs, movements of a refusal of this
spectacle?  And in so doing provide a myriad of examples of refusals
from which to take elements to continue the inventions of refusals?
        Marcel Duchamp introduced the world to the "ready-made."
Extending his thought further, one finds oneself working with the
ready-refuse. All around one, hidden in plain site,sight, cite--the
polyglot refus-sings.
         The ballads of Villon can be heard in all this refuse,  in
the  Medieval art of necessity still in existence today of "les
Glaneurs," "The Gleaners." (btw this is the name of a very great film
by Agnes Varda on this topic)
        I do not think one ever attains what is called "competence" in
any language without in some degree becoming "incompetent" in a
language of living. It is the necessity of living itself that exposes
to one the findings of languages in their multitudes among which one
may learn to work with basic elements to be opening outwo/ards into
and with othernesses.
      "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."--Paul Celan
       "I do not seek, I find"--Pablo Picasso    (both of them polyglots)

the above from a 1977 article in new literary history:


"Form, in the sense that I spoke of it here, thinks. Its appetite is

cosmological. It describes the soil of its origins and reflects on the act

itself. Let's say that it thinks by provoking thought. This is its aim,

intrinsically. For me, the virtue of certain poems of Gertrude Stein,

Robert Creeley, and Russell Edson, three poets who share this organic

idea of form, is that they are thought-machines, without once

resorting in their texts to anything that could be even remotely called

a "statement of ideas." I like that. A poetry which has the clarity and**

ambiguity of that world we discover in the morning on opening our

eyes."

Interesting that Professor Shirky brings up Asperger's in this context; the
comparison fits, though his explanation of how it fits is a bit
oversimplified.  (Though perhaps it isn't fair to blame him for that, given
that even newspapers like to pretend that people speak in soundbites.)

Email and other text-only online forms of communication can actually be
easier than face-to-face communication for a lot of us Aspies, as we're not
expected to pick up on non-verbals.  It also helps to be able to communicate
in an environment that isn't overstimulating (or understimulating).
Moreover, since we don't use nonverbals in the same way as other people,
many of us are used to expressing what others regard as emotional nuance
more directly.

So perhaps the mainstream world could learn from those of us on the autistic
spectrum as well as from writers (yes, the two groups sometimes overlap).
Of course, that would never happen, because autism is a "disease".

Barry,
Whoops! I was just being unnecessarily flippant, and
slightly self-deprecating (or that was the idea),
since I have some vested interest in the discussion,
being a bilingual French/English poet. Obviously,
reality's just a *tad* more complex than that, I'm
with you on this, Barry.
There's some basis in personal "impressions" for the
flippant remark: the first is the fact that one of the
most innovative novels in French by a black writer was
first published...in Canada (Kourouma). The Hexagonal
publishers said it was written in "terrible French".
This admittedly also has to do with language politics
in France's history, but the case doesn't appear to be
isolated, I'm afraid. There's some complicated history
involved in this sort of thing too, of course. But I
might add that the French literary canon is even more
of a "Boy's Club" than the Anglo-American canon (and
that's perhaps rather more verifiable).
More personal vested interests in all this, yes ;P
On a brighter note, everyone should go and read Leon
Gontran Damas' Pigments some time soon, I've been
loving it lately. Still can't understand why he's
stayed under most (scholarly and poetic, it would
seem) radars....
Mark: well said: I still disagree with a few details,
but I hope at least I didn't seem to be flaming you
too badly.
Interesting, though, how identity issues get all
jumbled up with issues of linguistic mastery, though,
isn't it? If people don't claim they speak their
second(ary) language at a "native" level, how much of
this is a consequence of how they identify themselves
as belonging to x or y linguistic
(/racial/political/geographical/national...)
community, and indeed *not* an issue of linguistic
mastery at all?
Thanks for bringing all these things up, Mark and
David.
Amicalement,
Alex

Andrew Keen, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has
set the blogosphere alight with his new book, a
scathing attack on user-generated content. Sub-titled
How the Internet is killing our culture, Keen’s book
is a polemic against the “anything goes” standards of
much of online publishing.

Mr Keen does not believe in “the wisdom of the crowd”.
Much of the content filling up YouTube, MySpace, and
blogs is just an “an endless digital forest of
mediocrity” which, unconstrained by professional
standards or editorial filters, can alter public
debate and manipulate public opinion

Mr Keen answers questions on user-generated content
and the digital revolution below.

............................................................................................................................................

You talk about the “structural crisis of much of
contemporary mainstream media institutions”. What do
you consider to be the causes of this crisis? Are they
to do with economics and business models, the
challenges of change, social and cultural trends, or
is it a politically-driven crisis? And do our
political leaders have any responsibility for
upholding ’the difference between truth and fiction’?
Nico Macdonald, London

Andrew Keen: Great, questions, Nico, which probably
deserve a book length response. I think the causes can
be found in both the popularity of the internet and
the rather pedestrian nature of much mainstream media.
In my book, I talk about a solution in which we
combine the best elements of authoritative
professional mainstream media and the dynamism and
irreverence of the Web. The Guardian online and the FT
are both doing this quite well (and profitably).

Really good question about the responsibility of our
political leaders. Entrusting defence of ”truth” to
them is a little Orwellian. However, I do think we
need a debate about the societal value of a free press
and the way we may, in the future, need to treat
newspapers or independent media as a public utility. I
think this is particularly relevant in the US, where
the free market is undermining the viability of many
traditional media institutions. Newspapers or even
record labels as non-profits is one solution. I hope
my book will at least begin to spark this kind of
conversation.

............................................................................................................................................

I agree with much of what your book seems to be
saying, though I find it a bit extreme. In response to
another question today, you state your book is a
polemic and is countering a belief that hasn’t been
countered much at all, and that’s why it’s so
black-and-white. But looking around at blogs in
particular isn’t part of the problem of Web 2.0
publishing the rise of polarisation and polemic?
James Doherty, London, UK

Andrew Keen: Fair point, James. I think that’s a very
valid criticism. the problem is that a very balanced
book doesn’t have the same kind of impact as a polemic
(both commercially and intellectually). What I’ve
tried to do is throw a bomb in the book and then have
slightly more reasoned conversations in person and on
the web. So far, this has worked quite well. I’m
thrilled with the response. We need to talk about
media literacy - it’s an important part of becoming
literate.

............................................................................................................................................

What’s the initial reaction been so far to your ideas?
Are you the most hated person on the blogosphere? Do
you think your ideas will catch on?
Kate Gallagher, Luton, UK

Andrew Keen: Lol. No. Actually the response has been
very fair. There are a few people on the internet who
think i’m the analog anti-christ. But many responsible
web 2.0 people - Kevin Kelly and David Weinberger for
example, have engaged in very interesting conversation
with me.

I’m currently in New York and last night I did a
debate with Jeff Howe of Wired Magazine. He said he
disagreed with 100 per cent of my book but was
thrilled that i’d written it and sparked the debate.
That’s exactly the kind of reaction that I was looking
for. We need to have this debate. It’s too important
now to ignore.

............................................................................................................................................

Doesn’t all of this really speak about human
behaviour? Isn’t it all about people creating their
own social environments using the technology? It’s not
the web that’s evil after all.
Alex Brdar, London

Andrew Keen: Very good point. I’ve never claimed that
the web is evil. It’s simply a mirror. When we look
into it, we see ourselves. Often, that view is quite
encouraging. But in the Web 2.0 age, we are
increasingly looking at a culture which has lost its
ethical moorings.

Rampant pornography, gambling, spamming, anonymity,
identity theft, flaming etc etc doesn’t speak highly
about what you call ”social environments.” And it’s
our responsibility to improve these environments, to
make them more civilised, to increase trust and
cooperation on the Internet. We want to be proud of
ourselves when we look in the mirror. For most of us,
however, looking at the Internet (ie: ourselves) is a
sobering and rather shameful experience.

............................................................................................................................................

What’s the implication of your critique for the more
accountable environs of a corporate intranet - would
you accept wikis might release real new potential in
some contexts?
Adam Hibbert, London

Andrew Keen: Of course. I think wikis in managed,
corporate environments, where everyone reveals who
they actually are, has great potential. The key
problem with public wikis like Wikipedia is their
anonymity and lack of accountability. This lends
itself to corruption, intellectual bullying and
contextless information. Managed, accountable wikis -
if that’s not a contradiction in terms - are the
reverse. I’ve been involved in several myself which
have been very fruitful and a lot of fun.

............................................................................................................................................

With the genie of anything goes “creativity” on the
web out of the proverbial bottle, what can be done at
this late stage - other than bemoan the state of our
society - to rein in the runaway wagon train that is
the blogosphere and its denizens who feel that they
possess an absolute right to procure the intellectual
property of others for their own benefit?
Michael Lee, The Hague

Andrew Keen: Books like mine challenge all this. The
responsibility is now with teachers, parents and
politicians to responsibly manage the consumption and
use of this media. This is particularly true on the IP
front. We shouldn’t be shy to aggressively fight
organisations like the Creative Commons which peddle a
lot of seductive nonsense about the common ownership
of intellectual content.

............................................................................................................................................

Do you really think internet users are so stupid that
they can’t see a fact stated on an .edu site is more
credible than one included on Wikipedia?
Dean, London

Andrew Keen: Unfortunately, I’m not convinced. Many
new internet users appear to trust websites like
Wikipedia as if they were the Britannica. The
challenge is building media literacy. The problem, I
fear, is that a generation brought up relying on
unreliable, trivial and often corrupt internet
information resources will have no intellectual means
of critically reading through the news.

............................................................................................................................................

What do you think of Wikipedia’s content control
mechanisms, and do you think a user-submitted
encyclopaedia can be relied upon to be factually
accurate or offer a true world view on any particular
topic?
Guy Carpenter, Istanbul

Andrew Keen: I’m not impressed. The problem is
anonymity. I want to know who the editors are. I trust
Britannica because I know it’s managed by experts. I
don’t trust Wikipedia because I have no idea who is
running it.

............................................................................................................................................

What is your view on the social implications of
internet trends and where do you see it all going?
Where do you see the social and cultural impacts of
Web 2.0?
A Kisel, London

Andrew Keen: I deal with this in great detail in my
book. Overall, the social implications are an
increasingly narcissistic world in which we will be
broadcasting to ourselves. Common cultural
understandings will breakdown. A common mainstream
culture will be the victim of the fragmenting
consequences of an increasingly personalised media
ecosystem.

............................................................................................................................................

What is your opinion about the Web 2.0 bubble?
Fabio Sacco, Rome

Andrew Keen: It’s an intellectual and economic bubble.
People are already getting bored with it. But the
problem of the long term flattening of mainstream
media is real. Things aren’t going to suddenly revert
back to the way they were.

............................................................................................................................................

Saying Web 2.0 is an endless forest of mediocrity is
thinking in black and white. Web 2.0 creates the
ability to promote anything indeed, but anything can
be very interesting as well. If you leave the
arbitrage to a (group of) professional(s), you insert
a subjective filter and that what’s Web 2.0 doesn’t
do. There are more and more well established artists
who became known thanks to Web 2.0. Still, I agree a
lot of junk is available too. So wouldn’t it be better
to broaden the colour palette and add shades of grey?
Jean-Louis de Hasque, Belgium

Andrew Keen: My book is a polemic. I am warning of the
logic consequences of our drift into a
self-broadcasting world. Such a dystopia needs to be
imagined if we are to constructively deal with the
profound changes of the Web 2.0 world. You only get
grey out of black and white. There’s a lot of white
out there with Web 2.0 idealists. The black of my book
is a healthy sceptical antidote to the utopians.

............................................................................................................................................

How did we arrive at this state? Why are we attracted
to amateur output when the professional stuff can be
so much better? Said another way, why can’t
intellectual quality stand on its own merits? Is what
you describe part of broader, progressive forces at
work: hasn’t every age introduced technologies that
have progressively facilitated the process of dumbing
down? Why isn’t the internet merely the one in ours?
Phil Stekl, Chicago

Andrew Keen: I’m very troubled by your pessimism.
There is nothing inevitable about what you call
”dumbing down” of culture in this or any other age. I
think the internet offers great potential to uplift
our entertainment and information economies.

The challenge is to harness its radical potential and
success integrate it with old media. We are not faced
with an either/or alternative. The future can be an
improvement on the past if we are able to utilise
technology to strengthen professional media.

............................................................................................................................................

How does one compete against the MTV-istion of culture
and art on the internet? It seems more and more
difficult to find useful information, to gage what
journals, if online, are performing a cultural good,
and to ascertain what might be called the permanence
of the internet phenomenon with regards to the
internet serving as a credible repository of creative
work. I am a writer and visual artist, my work
appearing both online and in print.
Alexander Jorgensen

Andrew Keen: We can compete with MTV (or MySpace and
YouTube) by stressing the political and cultural
benefits of media literacy in our schools and
universities.

Parents, too, have a responsibility to help their kids
consume media critically. I am particularly troubled
by the media illiteracy that Web 2.0 is spawning. This
is the most problematic consequence of a supposedly
democratised media.

............................................................................................................................................

Whilst I agree that there is a lot of crap to be found
online these days, how does Keen propose we police or
monitor what gets posted? Surely the whole beauty of
sites like YouTube is that it does act as a breeding
ground for amateur film-makers to make their mark.
Although many videos might not be the finished
article, Web 2.0 often provides the necessary platform
to get the message out there.
Finlay Clark, Edinburgh

Andrew Keen: This may be true. But the problem is that
it’s currently extremely hard to find high quality
content on sites like YouTube. What we forget is that
traditional media has done a great job historically
finding, polishing and distributing content. An
algorithm can’t do this. Nor can the crowd.

............................................................................................................................................

You’re right, there is a lot of rubbish online; but
what about the importance of freedom of speech and
expression? Isn’t it librerating that many more people
now have the opportunity to explore their creative
side and voice their opinions, even if the rest of the
world may think the outcome is nonsense.
Polly, London

Andrew Keen: I don’t have a problem with amateurs
expressing themselves online as long as they remain
consumers of professional media content. The problem,
however, is that the rise of a user-generated-content
media is intimately bound up with the structural
crisis of much of contemporary mainstream media
institutions. This isn’t a coincidence.

............................................................................................................................................

I support Mr Keen’s concern for quality, but would
like to know if he feels that young people aren’t up
to the mark. Does he see the blog as merely an
inferior version of literature? People who read blogs
or view YouTube clips may not be seeking truth, but
stimulus.
Lee Gilbert, Singapore

Andrew Keen: I don’t want to write-off all of our
young people. However, I do think that we need to
focus on teaching kids their responsibility in seeking
the truth by a critical reading of information media.
This Wikipedia generation are growing up with a
dangerously relativistic notion of the difference
between truth and fiction and between independent
content and advertising.

Dear David

That's a brilliant piece of writing. Mind's a bucket full of words,
someone said, and sometimes it just outweighs us, our hands refuse
carry its weight. That's how I felt trying to respond to your conscience-
whipper. Too many thoughts to put together into one body.

So, let me be content with one comment. The = of Language Poetry
may soon begin to look like a barbed wire - I'll bow to that wit.
It's a concern for sure. A real concern. Also I have found the
"=" sign baffling from day one. It makes all letters look alike, all
connotations dissolve into a goo of complete meaninglessness, all
words melt back into one ore. Are they talking about some kind of a hybrid,
universal language like Esperanto - that was my first thought. My last
thought too.

And BTW, "The Gleaners" is indeed a great film, an inspiring one for
poets.

      Forgive essaying to respond to three threads at once, yet i
think they are interrelated in very interesting ways.  (I won/t be
bale to them justice here, but an essay at a start--)
       Language can play very strange roles in its vaga-bondage from
the throat and fingers into the "aires" or "errors" heard by ears or
errers, and by the I/eye that reads the notations of its reeds.
         When i was sixteen i was living in the streets, parks and
abandoned buildings in Paris and for a brief spell with a tiny
Anarchist cell of workers at the Renault factory. After some
operations of the "propaganda of the deed" on unguarded empty police
vans we split up and i was back to living here and there.  Often there
would be many young people from various countries sleeping in a park,
or even just eating in a park, and the police would come through and
arrest as many as they could.  It's thanks to the police a lifelong
education began in questions of  identity, "profiling," handwriting,
finger printing, surveillance photos having to do with language,
whether it's one's first or second, let alone those of which William
S.  Burroughs notes in the Preface to Junkie, "a final glossary,
therefore,  cannot be made of words whose intentions are fugitive."
          Alex Dickow made a very important point--that it is not only
the accent which goes into speaking and writing a language in essaying
to learn it, it is many other things which constitute a mosaic-like
surface which in turn has to have when tested beneath this
"camouflaging" as it were the depths and contours of first a relief,
and, if that is  discovered, still another level of depths which flow
into the subconscious areas of involuntary memories and dreams.  Once
a language has begun to be dreamed in, and have involuntary memories
recalled through, it begins to manifest itself in the outward gestures
and expressions, body language, intonations and inflections, which one
begins "living out" when speaking and writing.
     And to go even further into these dreams and memories as well as
in waking consciousness, there is the growing frequency of bi-lingual
(or tri-lingual and more)  punnings and neologisms, collaged and
montaged visual/soundscapes that one finds keep turning up  "all over
the place" day and night. Arriving in this area, one begins to realize
a proliferation and loosening of "identity" not only in terms of
language but of body language as well. In a sense, one has achieved
the potential if not the existence, really, of being a "double agent."
      As usual with language of any kind, "doubling" is at the very
least a "two edged sword."  This "doubled agency" can be very
liberating and also very "suspicious," even imprisoning, depending on
the  people, places and things one encounters and is involved with.
One minute it's "double your pleasure,/double your fun/when you are
chewing/doublemint gum," and the next it's "where the dangers are
double/and the pleasures are few/where it's dark as the dungeon/and
damp as the dew."
   I had only been learning French for a bit less than two years, part
of that while living there and part from movies and books.  (I had
gone to Paris to be at the Cinematheque as much as possible;  at the
time it was the only place to be for the cine-possesed.) It had by
then entered dream and memory and been making the bi-lingual puns, and
without realizing it had transformed one physically when speaking.
The police, ever guardians of the "prison house(s) of language(s)"
immediately were suspicious.  They asserted my american passport was
either forged or stolen and turned me over to the CRS para-military
political police.  That was to be the first of a number of nightmarish
times with them.  Many of them were Algerian War veterans and into
torture, brutality, inflicting many injuries, some  that have never
completely healed.   Yet one didn't get beaten to death like an Arab
in an adjoining cell, whose "crime" was thinking himself really a
French citizen as his papers said he was.
      One time i was walking down the street and saw some people with
a table and literature.  A man came up to me and said--"You're Breton,
aren't you?"  Some of my ancestors were from there, but had arrived in
Quebec in 1650.  Well--i must learn about the Breton Liberation Front,
then, right?  A pleasant afternoon learning about this and helping
handout leaflets and pamphlets.  The next time arrested, the police
showed me a foto in which there i was, a "member" of the Liberation
Front.   This time it was "association with a group against the
Republic" and this led to another one later, charged with 'terrorism,"
 ironic considering the Anarchist events were never traced.
        When I went to England with my brother some months later, they
didn't believe the passport either.  I was put in a detention cell in
the ferry and given a whole battery of English language tests, very
fast--oral, written, reading.  Then asked for plane ticket return,
travelers' cheques,  and addresses of friends going to visit.  My
brother had no such problem.  He had been living and working in
Ticino, so wasn't dressed and didn't act the same way.  Oddlly, they
believed he was an American (though he looked like an Ticinese
peasant) and said,  besides you don't look like brothers.  Ten years
later when I went to England again, a variation of the same things
occurred.  (In between these visits  had read Henry Miller's account
of his unpleasant encounter with the British authorities.)
      Similar events followed me across Europe over several trips, the
most complicated one, too long to tell here, involved house arrest in
Poland and appearance before a military court.
      In every case, no matter the documentation, the charge involved
at the minimum forged passport and maximum such dangerous ones as
suspicion of terrorism, suspicion of espionage.  It didn't matter that
in some countries one didn't know the language at all.  Body language
and behaviour was what "told the truth."   One had become, in effect,
via bi-linguism, a life long double agent apparently.
      This sort of thing once started never seems to stop and has
followed me to Canada and in the USA.  Not suspicion of crimes, other
than simply not being American.  "Where are you really from, Dave,"
said the officer recently investigating what i was doing while working
on some pieces at a site.  "The squad car computer 's  says you're an
American.  You sure about that?  Not pulling my leg, now, are you?"
      In a funny way, this makes one wonder if one's first language
isn't a foreign one, and from there one goes into the sense of
doubling being at the pulsing heart of any language one encounters.
Years of being involved in other areas of existence only further this,
where indeed the fugitive words and incomplete glossaries that
Burroughs notes, become as much as a part of one's awareness and being
as the standardized versions of language one encounters when not among
fellow speakers of the others.  This is one among many other reasons
that i write of my works that they are involved with what is hidden in
plain site/sight/cite. The world one moves in is not simply
bi-lingual, but many, many lingual, though many of the langauges are
of necessity fragmentary, fugitive, in continual flux among the
ongoing flow of al that is. One adapts to a chamelon form of existence
in movements and words, images and sounds, gestures, vocabularies,
grammers that shift with the persons one deals with at any given time
of the day or night.
        Walking down a street one watches shadows, reflections for a
much wider multi-angled many-eyed as it were point of view.  The same
operates sonically, attuned to echoes to judge distances of others
from oneself, of buildings not yet seen lying ahead or where the
openings of alleys are in the darkest night.  In this way I began
working much more with learning to see when working via the touch, the
hands, and training the eyes to be able to feel textures when barely
enough illumination is present.  Languages found in darkness among the
unseen things reveberate through the nerves of the fingers to the
mind's throat.
      All of these lessons one brings to "language" and so one sees
and hears in language so much that those who use it are unaware of
themselves. (And never let oneself think that is one is "completely
aware," of even  but a small part of it at all either.) Thus, a person
who knows a number of languages may well hear in one of them things
that are unheard by those who are limited to that  one language only.
      That is, if one is seeing and listening and touching in as many
ways possible to learn just what it is in the continual arrangements
of particles what constitutes at any given moment the "language
situation," it is often not at all as it appears to be, presents
itself to be, or thinks itself to be. Areas of the muffling and
deadening or almost complete muteness of language open up, and in them
one finds that it is possible that the images of the world so to speak
become altered and deformed in a myriad ways.
     So much of what is taken to be the "facts of the matter,"
"time-tested truths", al the rest of it, are dependent on the willing
suspension of disbelief. Complete fabrications, outright lies,
deliberate dis-translations, plagiarized "originality," the smear, the
rumor, the plant, the carefully constructed claims of authority, the
forgery, the doctored tapes, fotos, videos,   the fool's gold are all
absolutely essential to the "truth" on which is built "order,"
"security," "threat," "the market," "freedom," "history," and the rest
of the gigantic Language which shoves people about and forces most of
them into hells on earth.  Every thing must be done to protect and
preserve the "willing suspension of disbelief" that is taken to be the
 "clear" "reasonable" thinking of the "well-informed citizen."
          The Gazas, Green Zones, Gated Communities of the world are
in the early stages of their developments in terms of the
architectures of security, surveillance, censorship, the making
completely visible within contained areas of persons who are
simultaneously kept invisible to the outside world.  (England is also
developing this to extreme degrees. And the new Boeing and
subcontracted Israeli firms Border Fence to be erected all along the
border of the USA and Mexico will be for a while the "showstopper.")
      Confinement on a grand scale becomes the new form, the black
hole, into which vanish peoples from history. The erasure is  further
carried out by language.  To eradicate languages is to cut off their
dreamings, their involuntary memories, their ghostly presences.  Even
to begin simply with methods of dis-translation, censorings, bannings,
falsifications or forgeries and the rest of the bag of tricks, is to
begin the work of expunging this existence of a language, of many many
languages. And not only "foreign" languages, but one's "own" language.
 Dreamings, desires, behaviours, can slowly be disposed of by the
continual work done on the fictions taken as facts and truths.
Languages of liberation turn quickly into those of the prison, the
torture chamber, the "disappeared."
The "=" sign in "Language" poetry can become pretty fast barbed wire.
And why not?  Does it not also need to preserve and protect, become
its own gated community in turn? Is this not why the "English official
language" movement is such a well funded one?  Or the reason only
certain forms of writing and reading  are taught as the "correct" or
the "resistant" ones?
              In a bizzare way, a great deal of effort is put into
simulating in language things which the simulators wittingly or not
are complicit in forcing upon others to live-- and a great many of
these themselves denied literacy, a nice touch!
     Language is to be "ruptured,"  "disrupted," "fragmented,"
"chaotic," "Meaningless," to undergo "chance" operations,
 to be given the variety of non-translation methods of translation one
can find in various lists of writing exercises, to be subjected to
"shocks," to be "interrogated," to be in short experimented upon in
the ways a great many persons are.  The benefit of this to the
experimenters is (supposed to be) that there will be the realization
in "form" of what is taeken to be "radical," and "resistant" to the
System.  This is all very much to the benefit of the System, however,
for it gives the "willing suspension of disbelief" its raison
d'etre--the creation of a fiction of resistance, while the System uses
these similarly named methodologies on persons who are in fact
"resistant."
       The set-up is dependent on there being one "National" language,
one  conception of Language, one form of "language poetry,""language
of poetry," "poetical language" and the like.
        Paradoxically, the more that there is this "Oneness," the more
there is the proliferation of the rubble, the waste, the debris, the
broken, the demolished, the rusted, the "useless,"created by its
brutal "construction of the New, the 'post'" "condition."  For all the
cleaning,  cleanliness and cleansing  imposed, there is ever more of
the dirty piling up all around one hidden in plain site/sight/cite.
      More and more of the peoples of the world live in these refuse
heaps, the "planet of slums" as Mike Davis calls it in a book of that
name, learning to exist on rubble. "How picturesque,"  "how admirable
the human spirit," say the fotos and captions of a current series in
the NY Times for example. "Tourism in other people's misery," as the
Situationists aptly described it.
     Yet, "Necessity is the motherfucker of invention," one sings to
oneself among the overlooked alleys and dirty bits and pieces of
letterings and forms, and in this already polyglot, already
fragmented, ruptured, thrown away, shell shocked, disaster shocked
refuse is where is found the seeds with which to refuse this gigantic
monomaniacal mono-linguism of simulations and controls.   One learns
among these sites/sights/cites refused further utility that there is
indeed the "utility of uselessness," for in the paradox of being thus
hidden, they have endured and still carry within them the languages of
dreams, involuntary memories, ghostly presences, the elements of
rhizomatic languages which, being fugitive, are not part of a complete
or ever to be completed glossary, never to be compiled and "contained"
within
 any one book, any two covers, any one language, any one system.
        From that necessity comes the discipline through practice of
finding the improvised  leap of many El Spontaneos into the ring where
not only the real bulls are encountered, but the rituals, languages,
organizings of the spectacle of Death.  Prepared by necessity, myriad
tongued motherfucker of invention, can not the El Spontaneos
improvize the myriad gestures, songs, movements of a refusal of this
spectacle?  And in so doing provide a myriad of examples of refusals
from which to take elements to continue the inventions of refusals?
        Marcel Duchamp introduced the world to the "ready-made."
Extending his thought further, one finds oneself working with the
ready-refuse. All around one, hidden in plain site,sight, cite--the
polyglot refus-sings.
         The ballads of Villon can be heard in all this refuse,  in
the  Medieval art of necessity still in existence today of "les
Glaneurs," "The Gleaners." (btw this is the name of a very great film
by Agnes Varda on this topic)
        I do not think one ever attains what is called "competence" in
any language without in some degree becoming "incompetent" in a
language of living. It is the necessity of living itself that exposes
to one the findings of languages in their multitudes among which one
may learn to work with basic elements to be opening outwo/ards into
and with othernesses.
      "Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."--Paul Celan
       "I do not seek, I find"--Pablo Picasso    (both of them polyglots)

the regulator thing gets me again

i woke up this morning feeling ill again, neck hurts, bad headache, can't
focus eyes very well, joints hurt, sniffling, slight difficulty breathing,
slight sore throat, chest feeling like a bad case of the flue, slight
chills, this has been happening far too often, earlier this week accompan-
ied by very slight fever, the attacks which are more like slowly seeping
states, coming on now maybe four times a week, sometimes five, so the
doctor diagnosed a low-grade or background bacterial infection, for years,
i remember the first time in buffalo, more recently a few years ago caught
a 'lyme-like' disease in buffalo, that seemed to clear up, she's testing
now for lyme disease and something else, i forget, something has to show
up on the charts, i've given up on psychosomatic, the symptoms come too
often and too regularly and with the same sort of background catalysts
such as a change in temperature when i'm sleeping, she thinks also chronic
fatigue syndrome, it could be anything, both ears blocked this morning,
the right ear hurting, 'ear-ache,' tinnitus as usual, i realized i don't
know what it's like to be healthy and or wide-awake, or rather that those
states occur as rarely as sickness does among most people, i'm a walking
inverse, i worry about tia as well, that all this could be leading some-
where, but that part's definitely hypochondria, although a brain-scan
found evidence of some tia stuff, but that was a few years ago, now pop tv
health stuff came out with a story about tia tending towards strokes, more
'warning signs,' the whole culture's filled with 'warning signs,' in any
case last night i found a file, WS_3008 to be exact, some slide-chromatic
playing i hadn't done anything with, i thought, well then, made the fol-
lowing which i quite like, i'm over the top that way, too full of myself
that way, anyway for listening pleasure http://www.asondheim.org/bloor.mp3
- there might be something there for you, i fell asleep here on the office
floor at the modern culture and media building at brown, well not the
floor exactly but a futon that pulls out from a couch, last night actually
was awake and feeling healthy, something had given me a respite, it's gone
away now, sometimes i'm accused that my work is autobiographical or 'diar-
istic' - it isn't, but this is, thought i would surround the bloor piece
with an indication of its production and disemmination, i forget how i
felt when i first made the original recording, before the manipulation, i
think it was as 'usual,' that is exhausted and most likely feeling these
flu-like symptoms which at one point i dubbed 'low-temperature' disease
since it seemed to have something to do with my body temperature dropping,
but that's not true at all, my body temperature's usually low, this has
nothing to do with age by the way, the symptoms as i said were around at
least since i've was in buffalo and that was in the 1980s, but now they're
exacerbated, possibly due to stress and toxins in the apartment we're
living in, we should move out of there, but where to go, where to go, so
to conclude, we're all bored right now, i'm not feeling well enough to
continue, a student's coming soon as well, this is definitively diaristic,
unabashedly autobiographical, a bit off the old block on a very dreary
providence rhode island day, the sort of day i like, with greys and greens
and just a hint of the world beyond,

Not to put too fine a point on it, but the criticism was NOT that people c=
an't
WRITE fine poetry in 2nd or 4th or 7th languages, but that they may miss t=
he
nuances of OTHER PEOPLE's poetry.

This kind of self-defensive reflex is sort of interesting to watch, but no=
t very
illuminating, and certainly not on point. How many of us think that we are=
 in
fact able to read poems in our 2nd or 4th or 7th languages as well as nati=
ve
speakers do?

Dear Diane di Prima

Thanks for your posts - this one and the one before that helped small =
and
marginal poets like me see where Creely's poetry stands in the context =
of
concurrence and how the authority often rakes up great poetry pages to =
prove
to us that they are dead leaves, despite their slow-decay. Poets like
you help us reshape our literary wisdom and conscience when they often
crumble from lack of proper aeration.=20

I am no expert in Creely, but have been snipping off small portions
from his versatile repertoire for the past couple of years. To me, =
Creely
sounds like a poet of the "circumstance" - one who could write a poetry =
of
substance from any given moment of his or anyone's life. I saw a video
interview of Creely once where he read a poem about the embarassment of
going to a medical store to buy a woman's "thing" for his wife/lover. I
think one of his book-blurbs quote John Ashbery saying something like
"Creely's poetry is like the easy breath we can't live without...". All =
of
what you said is even more apt, at least as far as I could relate. Sure,
literary survival is in the hands of time but to ensure that we need to =
wipe
of any fingerprints the authority leaves on it. Decay is a function of =
touch
as we all know. Your earlier note was embalming. Thank you for that with =
all
my heart.


Thousands of years back in India, emperor's had court poets who wrote =
some
of the most beautiful, ageless poems of their times and there were
kings/nawabs who were poets themselves (like Wajid Ali Shah, portrayed =
to
perfection by Satyajit Ray in his film "Chess Players") and then there =
were
the gorgeous Mogul Kings who employed genres of court poets and =
musicians.
The court poets and their poetry often reflected royal taste. The best
poets/poetry have often been fostered by a royalty that understood
linguistic finesse, artistry, the need to connect the human to her/his
entourage and saw the poet not as a spokesperson or a curator but as an
advancer of art. Bad kings made bad poets. Sure the court poet didn't =
have
the freedom to speak against his master but often had the courage and
liberty to speak on behalf of the people. Public voice, thus, rang =
within
elitist art - at least sometimes. Today, India does not have a =
"sabhakabi"
(court-poet) but we do in America and certain other parts of the western
world. And like as always, bad kings make bad court-poets.

Dear Friends=20

I want to thank you for your very interesting input.

This is the first time since joining the list that I have engaged in
anything close to a =B3real=B2 discussion, voiced anything close to a =
small
slice of my real thoughts and opinions, and I=B9ve learned a lot. What I
learned first of all is that I certainly won=B9t send my piece, nor any
similar piece, to NYRB or anywhere else. And I remembered again how =
utterly
pointless opinions=8Bmine or anyone else=B9s=8Btruly are.

For me, the heart of the matter is the poem. At my age I can ill afford =
to
be drawn into discussions which steal many hours from the work at hand. =
As
for my friends and other poets, living and dead, time will sort out =
whose
work matters=8Bno way any of us can know anything about that right now.
(Remember Robert Southey was Poet Laureate of England while Wordsworth =
and
Coleridge, Shelley and Keats, were alive.)

Even more compelling to me is the consideration that as a Buddhist I =
long
ago made a commitment not to contribute in any way to discord within the
sangha=8Band the poetry community most certainly is a sangha=8Bit=B9s =
meaningless
if it=B9s not that. I had hoped that I was writing without animosity or
stridency, but I seem to have stirred up both.

This in itself is reason enough for me to =B3shut up and listen=B2, =
which is my
plan at this time.=20

Thanks again.

I'm coming to this debate a little late in the game (it started on my
birthday!), but was interested to read Diane DiPrima's wonderful & lucid
critique of the Simic article. That is, until I read this line:

"It may be that Mr. Simic lacks the language skills to read Creeley and
perhaps many other American poets. It is hard--almost impossible--to hear
all the layerings of meaning in any but your native tongue."

As someone who moved to the U.S. at 19 and began to write in English at 22
(after I was quite sure I had absorbed its "layerings"), I'm disheartened at
this reductive shot at Simic and other non-native poets. If this criticism
were to be followed to its logical conclusion, should e.g. only the work of
American/British poets be discussed on this list -- by other
American/British poets? It IS possible not only to learn a language but to
read, write, emote and live in it complexly. I can only wish this on more
U.S.-born poets.

Pierre,

Usually, this mother tongue argument goes along with the claim that iambic
pentameter is the natural language of poetry because it imitates the heart
beat. I encountered both arguments thirty-five years ago at Bread Loaf, in
the key note speech John Ciardi gave as the director.

The same question is dealt with in Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist when
Stephen questions the language used by him (and the Irish) and his Jesuit
teacher, who was an Englishman. There is a passage in A Portrait about
comparing the word "tundish" with the word "funnel."

Pierre, what is your third language?

Artanil,

Someone else may already have responded to your questions/concerns about the = sign in L=A=N...It has been made clear in a number of publications, including In the Language Tree, that the sign was a reminder that signs (letters) refer, have meaning only in relation, to other letters; their referentail value then is not one of equality but rather one of convention. The "equal" here then means that all signs are sign insofar as they differ from other signs,differences that make them all "equal" in value as signs.

Ron Silliman, for what it's worth, confessed (or perhaps "confessed"
since as I recall he did not seem particularly troubled by the fact)
that he was unable to HEAR the great majority of postWWII British and
Irish poetry:  their ears, their sense of the syllable and the line,
didn't work for him.  (This on his blog, within the past couple of
years....) And for him this inability equated with the inability to
read these poets, to value them....

This, I propose, is an inability to read poetry in something seeming
rather close to one's own language, and an inability that has
everything to do with what being a native speaker means...I add the
point simply to suggest that the stakes in this conversation doesn't
necessarily amount to simply correcting a prejudice.

Iterations in a binary meditation on Jim Leftwich:
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/leftwich

These were generated during a dbcinema search for Jim Leftwich. All the
images are 1280x1024. Though the dbcinema search was on 'Jim Leftwich', not
all the images are by Jim. I see there's reference to David Baptiste-Chirot,
Bob Cobbing, and I see a bpNichol poem in there too.

Also did a search for 'Mondrian Kandinsky':
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/mondrian-kandinsky/1.jpg

and a search on 'Kandinsky':
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky/1.jpg

Still working on dbcinema. It's coming along slowly. The above were
generated with the first of many 'brushes' I'll be writing. The 'brush' in
the above images is a long, thin rectangle which, each frame of the movie,
is rotated a bit more. In any given frame, the 'brush' 'draws'a sliver of
whatever picture is current among the images downloaded from the net via the
dbcinema query.

what I at any rate was talking about. Note that=20
I'm far more interested in the question of=20
language acquisition, and how the acquirer=20
experiences it, than whether when or how one=20
learns it has any influence on how one writes,=20
much less on the quality (or qualities) of the writing.

That said, none of us use any language fully. We=20
come to the table with different abilities and=20
different needs. Presumably one writes=20
differently accordingly. The recognitiion of difference is not=
 disparagement.

One of my translator/scholar friends writes in=20
Spanish and speaks flawless, idiomatic Mexican=20
Spanish--I first met her at a Mexican poetry=20
conference, at which she was one of the few=20
non-Mexicans, and listening to her one heard=20
nothing to betray that she had learned the=20
language as a teenager, not even the slight=20
hesitations that for most of us accompany the=20
working-around of a concept that we lack the word=20
for in the new language. She's one of the=20
translators in my Cuban anthology, and she sent=20
me her cv so that I could extract a bio note.=20
Under "languages" she notes "near-bilingual in=20
Spanish." I asked her about this, and she cited=20
the kinds of things I mention below. It isn't for=20
her a matter of the quality of the product but=20
her consciousness of in her case a small degree=20
of distance. I've been told similar things by=20
other friends who appear to be bilingual, and=20
function as such, but don't claim to be so.

You and Pierre are not unique as translators into=20
a second language, in your case from your primary=20
language, in Pierre's from languages learned very=20
young and also more recently acquired languages=20
which remain less fully acquired (I'm thinking of=20
Arabic, Pierre). Not unique, but there are very=20
very few who do so successfully. Most attempts to=20
translate into the acquired language fall short=20
of adequacy--I'm thinking of Brodsky's=20
self-translations (I take it on the testimony of=20
Russian speakers that in Russian he's a very=20
great poet) and of Eliseo Diego's translations of=20
himself and other Cuban poets. Eliseo seems to=20
have thought of himself as fully bilingual, but=20
you wouldn't guess that from the translations.

I do understand that this is a sensitive issue=20
for many. It would be lovely to have a less fraught discussion about it.

As to Zukofsky, once again, he was raised in a=20
polyglot environment that began at the door of=20
the family home and was educated in English from the age of five.

A better example might be Armand Schwerner, who=20
was innocent of English until his family arrived=20
in New York when he was 9. Armand's spoken=20
English was often odd--over-studied, overly=20
hieratic. One might have ascribed that to his=20
late acquisition, but I heard him speak French=20
over the course of several months spent in Paris=20
at the same time. Many people put forward=20
different aspects of their personalities in their=20
different languages. Not Armand. He was exactly=20
the same in his native French, which had all the peculiarities of his=
 English.

Here's that earlier email. Note the final paragraph.

I second Ana's emotions.

I was raised in an Italian family that spoke only in a dialect a handful of=
 people knew. I learned to read and write English only in the 2nd grade or =
so, after numerous implorations from my parents' neighbors (I would sing op=
era at age 5 to the chagrin of most of the neighborhood).=20

There's something missing from Diane's critique: sound. We're not only read=
ing poetry to get at meaning via verbal/grammatical/syntactical cues, but t=
hrough the sound of it, the amalgamation of all the elements, and,if so be =
it, we want only to focus on these elements, then we have felt at least one=
 part of the elephant - we can talk to the other dudes who experienced the =
tail, the leg, the tusk, the snout, etc. Then, and only then, through some =
understanding of the 'social' aspects of poetry, that is, a dialogue spawne=
d from a reading involving numerous readers, again, then, and only then, ca=
n we have a picture (at least almost a full one) and an understanding of a =
poem.=20

It's elitist to be 'a' reader. There's so few of us reading poetry in the f=
irst place! What I'm saying is, if we don't experience the many layers of a=
 poem because we're not native speakers, then how about calling your neighb=
or up and sharing a moment? Come on, people! We live in a society not a her=
mitage!

And to throw another monkey in the pudding - how do native speakers fare if=
 they're not 'cultured' enough? See what kind of prejudices we undertake wh=
en we talk about 'native speakers' and multi-level understanding? Even well=
 intentioned Americans have no luck in knowing anything because of the subs=
criptive powers of advertising and TV and the Fed. Listen to your neighbor =
is what I'm saying. Share some intuition. No one has the monopoly on langua=
ge and understanding. That is SO not sexy!

There is a recent statement in an interview?by Bernstein that belies this explanation of the equals sign...Bernstein was interviewed by someone on this list I believe...think it's an online mag based out of India...(Karauba?)...and he downplayed any higher meaning...he said they wanted to distinguish the journal from the professional journal that shared the name and from Jack Spicer's use of it...I believe he said something along the lines of "we liked the way it looked"...paraphrasing...

Artanil,

Someone else may already have responded to your questions/concerns about the =
sign in L=A=N...It has been made clear in a number of publications, including In
the Language Tree, that the sign was a reminder that signs (letters) refer, have
meaning only in relation, to other letters; their referentail value then is not
one of equality but rather one of convention. The "equal" here then means that
all signs are sign insofar as they differ from other signs,differences that make
them all "equal" in value as signs.

I'm not holding one or another of these positions; I'm only pointing out that the
original holding was not that 2nd or subsequent languages meant that one
couldn't write well, even poetry, in those languages, but that 2nd and
subsequent languages are not READ LIKE one's native language. The
assertion was that non-native speakers of English may miss the native-
speaking nuances of some native-speaker-written poets, the Creeley/Simic
issue as an example.

New on Glossolalia: MAYBE YOU HAD WOODEN FINGERS IN A PAST LIFE, a 16-minute
video by Brian Howe and Ashley Howe.

MYHWFIAPL premiered at the minor american poetry/art series in Durham, NC,
on Oct. 6, which also featured a reading by Jessica Smith.

With special thanks to Alan Sondheim, who posted some recordings of Tibetan
cymbals to this list, which became a crucial component of the video's
soundtrack.

MYHWFIAPL is available for stream or download via the Glossolalia website:

http://glossolalia-blacksail.blogspot.com/2007/10/glossolalia-video.html

Best,
Brian Howe

Mark,

I was basically responding to Diane's comment, if I understood her
correctly, that Simic did not, could not understand the subtleties in C's
poetry because he was a foreigner. I think that argument is basically
nonsensical. I love C's poetry. But it is possible to understand C's poetry
fully and still not like it. For almost a hundred years people did not like
Dickinson's poetry. Most of these people were native speaking New
Englanders.

But, I was referring to something beyond that, something related to the
nature of American English as a poetic language and to the nature of
American culture:

a) In our day, American English functions as an imperial language, as a
lingua franca, even for its "native" speaker. One may call it a
"step-mother" tongue. The relation of the poet to such a language is
different from a poet using a "mother" tongue. It involves a subtle
linguistic alienation which the poet needs to confront and, to my mind,
exploit.

b) Since the advent of photography in the 19th century, later tabloid
newspapers, movies, etc., the main medium of public communication, of myth
building in The United States has progressively been visual, not words. As =
a
result, verbal language in a subtle way is shunted aside. A very significan=
t
schism has occurred between public (imperial) language and mother tongue.
The American poetry is written in a step-mother tongue, the "mother tongue"
trying to carve entries into this monolith. As a result, unlike in English
or French poetry for instance, the idea of tradition does not exist in
American poetry. (But this is another argument.)

Ciao,

Murat

as always some provocative ideas from Mr Zizek--
the Chinese government feeling that Buddhism is good because it helps
promote harmony is an echo of studies on how Buddhists are found by
American corporations and businesses to be ideal kinds of workers for
a similar reason--
"it's the economy stupid" is the "hidden tiger"--
that and control--(whose idea of what harmony meansand sounds like--)
and "empty" 'cultural' forms faced by ones taken to be real--
which paradoxically seems "hard to believe"--

Check out the new online journal from India: Almost Island.

It features a "tape-essay" by Tosa Motokiyu, Ojiu Norinaga, and Okura
Kyojin available here:

http://www.almostisland.com.

In it Motokiyu et al suggest that Kenneth Koch actually wrote the
poem "A True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island" as an
homage to Frank O'Hara. This is a compelling document on the
composition of an iconic New York School poem.

Other work included also by Sarah Shun-lien Bynum, Mikhail N.
Epstein, Kent Johnson, and others.

Murat: Much here to elucidate and argue over.=20
I'll confine myself to a very few things:

1. I personally don't care if Simic (or anyone=20
else, for that matter) likes Creeley's work. What=20
concerned me in the review was the terms of the=20
criticism, which set Creeley up to represent and=20
condemn an entire school of American poetry (and=20
British, too, if Simic's eye strayed that far).

2. "For almost a hundred years people did not=20
like Dickinson's poetry." This mystifies me.=20
Sure, there were some hostile critics, but much=20
of the initial reception of the poems when they=20
first came out in the 1890s, from critics and=20
from the reading public (there used to be a=20
reading public), was enthusiastic. The=20
anthologies that I grew up with, rmy mother's=20
course books in High School and college, first=20
published in the 20s and 30s, devoted as much=20
space to Dickinson as to Whitman, each of whom=20
received more space than anyone else.

3. "The idea of tradition does not exist in=20
American poetry." I don't think this is true. But=20
perhaps you mean tradition in a special sense?

This article calls the Buddha a deity.  He never was nor did he claim to be a deity.  He was always just a highly evolved human being.  That his development was due to his own efforts rather than some divine intervention is important to remember, too.  Still, the main point of this article that the Chinese government is trying to control rebirth may seem funny at first.  But their real point is to further control the minds and lives of Tibetans.  There is currently a controversy over where the Panchen Lama is and who he is.  TheChinese claim to have one but the Dalai Lama and most exiles do not recognize this appointment by the government.  The Panchen Lama is or was considered the most important figure in the Tibetan hierarchy after the Dalai Lama.  This new edict by the Chinese may sound ridiculous but it has a serious purpose: to gain some measure of control over the future appointments of the Dalai Lama and other revered high lamas in the Tibetan religion once the
 current generation has passed on.  Regards, Tom Savage

I think this might be of interest to some. I saw
Stelarc in Milwaukee years ago, and then later in
Prague. Both times, found his work to be very
interesting.

But it's you who takes Creeley to represent a school of poetry, no? And almost all of us on this list seem to agree with you in this!

Mark Weiss <junction@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:  Murat: Much here to elucidate and argue over.
I'll confine myself to a very few things:

1. I personally don't care if Simic (or anyone
else, for that matter) likes Creeley's work. What
concerned me in the review was the terms of the
criticism, which set Creeley up to represent and
condemn an entire school of American poetry (and
British, too, if Simic's eye strayed that far).

2. "For almost a hundred years people did not
like Dickinson's poetry." This mystifies me.
Sure, there were some hostile critics, but much
of the initial reception of the poems when they
first came out in the 1890s, from critics and
from the reading public (there used to be a
reading public), was enthusiastic. The
anthologies that I grew up with, rmy mother's
course books in High School and college, first
published in the 20s and 30s, devoted as much
space to Dickinson as to Whitman, each of whom
received more space than anyone else.

3. "The idea of tradition does not exist in
American poetry." I don't think this is true. But
perhaps you mean tradition in a special sense?

Mark,

I have no doubt that Simic has an aesthetic/political view behind his
comments on C. My point is that that criticism has little to do with his
knowing the subtleties of English as a foreigner.

My phrase a hundred years was careless. But in her life time she had
difficulty in being taken seriously by the day's establishment. Even her
mentor (his name escapes me now), who so some elusive quality in her poetry=
,
did not do anything to publish it.

By no tradition I do mean no tradition, but in what way, that takes time to
explain. My essay Questions of Accent is about that.

Check out the new online journal from India: Almost Island.

It features a "tape-essay" by Tosa Motokiyu, Ojiu Norinaga, and Okura
Kyojin available here:

http://www.almostisland.com.

In it Motokiyu et al suggest that Kenneth Koch actually wrote the
poem "A True Account of Talking to the Sun at Fire Island" as an
homage to Frank O'Hara. This is a compelling document on the
composition of an iconic New York School poem.

Other work included also by Sarah Shun-lien Bynum, Mikhail N.
Epstein, Kent Johnson, and others.

PLEASE FWD & SHARE WIDELY!!!

For several years now, Small Press Traffic has been organizing an annual Poets'
Theater Festival as our yearly fundraiser, with each year's event showcasing
new innovative works, often staged for the first time here in San Francisco. The festival has each year gathered huge audiences that come out to see writers & artists on stage, in innovative performance works, pushing the boundaries of theater and poetry in staged readings, musicals, neo-benshi film screenings, performance writing pieces, and the like.
This year we are excited to have three nights of new programming, including a PoetsTheater revival night and a cabaret, as well as a night of newly commissioned plays and performance works.
We would like to invite you to consider contributing work for this year's cabaret - a full night of innovative performance works currently scheduled for Sunday Feb 3 at 21 Grand in Oakland, CA. We are looking for innovative performances in the avant-garde cabaret tradition. This could range from brief skits to musical acts, improvised performance to conceptual magic tricks, impromptu tableux vivants to feats of aesthetic daring. We could imagine instructional pieces a la Yoko Ono (to be performed by yourself or members of the audience), cross-genre collaborations, puppet shows, etc. The main constraints are that each piece be less than 5 minutes longe, require little-to-no technical support (beyond a microphone), and adhere to this year's theme, which is:

"PERFORM YOUR SYMPTOM(S)"...

If you are interested, we would ask for a proposal for a work of NO MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES in length by NOVEMBER 1ST, to poetstheater@gmail.com . If you are unable to attend but would like to send in a proposal for someone else to perform on your behalf, that'd be great too. You should know that the Poets Theater Festival is out major fundraising vehicle for this year's budget, and we will thus be unable to offer you any money to participate. However, we can offer this unique opportunity to perform or have your work staged in front of a packed house of enthusiastic audience members, in the context of an ongoing and evolving community of avant-garde writers and performers.
Pleaae let us know as soon as you can if you are interested, and please don't
hesitate to email with questions and the like.
all best,
David Buuck, Stephanie Young, and Cynthia Sailers,
SPT PT 08 Committee

OK, Barry. I think most people on the list get=20
it. Without even refreshing my memory about the article:

1. The reason most of us like comnplete or=20
collected editions is not because poet x never=20
wrote a mediocre poem, but because if poet x ever=20
wrote a poem that really intrigues us we want to=20
know as much as we can about his process.

2. Simic apparently isn't interested in process.

3. He cites favorably only poems that can stand=20
alone, as opposed to poems that work as part of a=20
series. He doesn't even seem to notice that from=20
Pieces on Creeley is writing in books. Pieces=20
itself is designed on the page to make it=20
unlikely one could miss this. Because he doesn't=20
realize, or lets us think he doesn't realize,=20
that the book is the unit he thinks he's proven=20
his point by quoting a few lines out of context.=20
Of course one could do the same with Shakespeare.

4. He seems not to understand that in Pieces and=20
thereafter Creeley is creating environments of=20
words and lines, in which the silences are as=20
important as the sounds. He really wants=20
well-wrought urns, preferrably wearing all those=20
themes so convenient for teaching right on their surfaces.

5. The kind of writing he doesn't get is usually=20
called open form. It's not about first thought=20
best thought, to quote Ginsberg--presumably a=20
whole lot of stuff wound up in Creeley's=20
notebooks that never made it into the poems, and=20
I'd be surprised if he never cleaned up around=20
the edges. But it is an attempt to evade the=20
internal censor that says "this is poetic, that=20
isn't," or "this is appropriate to say, that=20
isn't." Which means that the poem doesn't tell=20
you where it's going til you get there, which is=20
the discovery of the shape of the experience, and=20
it's just as much a surprise to the poet--poet=20
and reader have both learned something.  This=20
kind of writing is dangerous to an ordered life=20
and perhaps threatening who depend on a burocratized  sense of sense.

6. An aside: in mentioning the poems he likes he=20
misses The Finger, in Pieces, to my mind the best=20
of Creeley's stand-alone poems, also I think his=20
longest. One of the hreat poems in the language.=20
Selon moi. Maybe Simic was akimming.

7. When he talks about Creeley's place in the=20
world he makes a very odd claim, that Creeley was=20
as famous as Lowell, and almost as famous as=20
Ginsberg, circa 1965. This is utter nonsense.=20
Like it or not, all of us who read Creeley read=20
Lowell, while most of those who read Lowell had=20
never heard of Creeley. Ginsberg was of course a=20
celebrity, though less so than he would later=20
become, but among those concerned with poetry=20
Lowell was a close second--he was the white=20
knight of the establishment literary scene.

8. So why elevate Creeley? To knock down all who=20
work in open form. Notice Simic doesn't say it=20
doesn't ring his bell, he says that it was a mistake, a delusion.

9. Interestingly, his brief mention of Olson=20
describes him as a fisherman, a postman, a=20
semocratic aparatchik and a member of the=20
Roosevelt administration. The first two were=20
summer jobs when he was in high school and=20
college. Whatever thought Simic had in mind isn't=20
played out, but it could hardly have been laudatory.

10. With lots and lots of caveats and lots and=20
lots of variations, Ceeley represents a kind of=20
poetry in which an act or voyage of discovery=20
happens in the course of the poem, Simic a kind=20
of poetry in which an act of discovery is=20
recollected in tranquility and reshaped for the=20
public. These are radically different ways to=20
conceptualize not only the act of writing but the=20
way one lives. Creeley's way is literally=20
experimental--each poem, each moment in a life,=20
conceived as an experiment, a "what if."

I could probably be more lucid about this if I had the time, but I don't.

The Trevor Joyce-Fergal Gaynor- Maria(the Finnish Baroque Fiddler) dropped down with a big succcess in the Maude Fife Room at UC Berkeley last night. (One of their tangent vists off the recent Soundeye West event last weekend in Los Angeles). They have upcoming events at Beyond Baroque in LA and, possibly, UC Santa Barbara, and then Trevor heads off solo to U Ohio and one of the institutions in Providence (not a religious one!).

 If you are anywhere in the vicinity, I suggest catching them.   During Trevor Joyce's astonishing rockhard lyric roll through of probably the most strictly compressed verse of which, at least, I am familiar, I began wishing there he could do a back to back reading with Seamus Heaney. Top off that combination with the inclusion of Tom Raworth and/or Peter Manson, and the constrasts, as some might say, would be quite instructive, particularly as to the rigorous differences between the revelation of hard earned sentiment, versus, the soft 'representation' of sentiment.

 For those unfamiliar with Trevor's work, he uses the cell structure of Excel, and other such software, to create very tight poetic forms of severely isolate cominations and sequences of words. Content and what is 'felt' is constantly contested by the structure to create a finely toned weaving of "text tiles" (the 'tiles' are the individual words that are made to fit into each pre-fixed cell). All of which might sound like formal hokey-pokey, but Trevor as not a poet dummy, brings in terrifce goods. I was sitting next to Lyn Hejinian and Jean Day - the three of us practically on the edge of our seats, listening.

 Now, by virtue of the the death of the dollar, which has brought a great bang for the travel buck for those with Pounds or Euros, I hope more USA institutions and reading sites can begin to welcome in more folks from Europe, Ireland, and England (not to mention other countries about the globe).  There are, it seems to me, a number of great/very good Irish/Brit poets to 'invade" and throw much more of what happened last night at Berkeley.  A likeable kind of reverse imperialism!

Well put. So now it's you who should write the letter that Diane refuses to write.

Mark Weiss <junction@EARTHLINK.NET> wrote:  OK, Barry. I think most people on the list get
it. Without even refreshing my memory about the article:

1. The reason most of us like comnplete or
collected editions is not because poet x never
wrote a mediocre poem, but because if poet x ever
wrote a poem that really intrigues us we want to
know as much as we can about his process.

2. Simic apparently isn't interested in process.

3. He cites favorably only poems that can stand
alone, as opposed to poems that work as part of a
series. He doesn't even seem to notice that from
Pieces on Creeley is writing in books. Pieces
itself is designed on the page to make it
unlikely one could miss this. Because he doesn't
realize, or lets us think he doesn't realize,
that the book is the unit he thinks he's proven
his point by quoting a few lines out of context.
Of course one could do the same with Shakespeare.

4. He seems not to understand that in Pieces and
thereafter Creeley is creating environments of
words and lines, in which the silences are as
important as the sounds. He really wants
well-wrought urns, preferrably wearing all those
themes so convenient for teaching right on their surfaces.

5. The kind of writing he doesn't get is usually
called open form. It's not about first thought
best thought, to quote Ginsberg--presumably a
whole lot of stuff wound up in Creeley's
notebooks that never made it into the poems, and
I'd be surprised if he never cleaned up around
the edges. But it is an attempt to evade the
internal censor that says "this is poetic, that
isn't," or "this is appropriate to say, that
isn't." Which means that the poem doesn't tell
you where it's going til you get there, which is
the discovery of the shape of the experience, and
it's just as much a surprise to the poet--poet
and reader have both learned something. This
kind of writing is dangerous to an ordered life
and perhaps threatening who depend on a burocratized sense of sense.

6. An aside: in mentioning the poems he likes he
misses The Finger, in Pieces, to my mind the best
of Creeley's stand-alone poems, also I think his
longest. One of the hreat poems in the language.
Selon moi. Maybe Simic was akimming.

7. When he talks about Creeley's place in the
world he makes a very odd claim, that Creeley was
as famous as Lowell, and almost as famous as
Ginsberg, circa 1965. This is utter nonsense.
Like it or not, all of us who read Creeley read
Lowell, while most of those who read Lowell had
never heard of Creeley. Ginsberg was of course a
celebrity, though less so than he would later
become, but among those concerned with poetry
Lowell was a close second--he was the white
knight of the establishment literary scene.

8. So why elevate Creeley? To knock down all who
work in open form. Notice Simic doesn't say it
doesn't ring his bell, he says that it was a mistake, a delusion.

9. Interestingly, his brief mention of Olson
describes him as a fisherman, a postman, a
semocratic aparatchik and a member of the
Roosevelt administration. The first two were
summer jobs when he was in high school and
college. Whatever thought Simic had in mind isn't
played out, but it could hardly have been laudatory.

10. With lots and lots of caveats and lots and
lots of variations, Ceeley represents a kind of
poetry in which an act or voyage of discovery
happens in the course of the poem, Simic a kind
of poetry in which an act of discovery is
recollected in tranquility and reshaped for the
public. These are radically different ways to
conceptualize not only the act of writing but the
way one lives. Creeley's way is literally
experimental--each poem, each moment in a life,
conceived as an experiment, a "what if."

I could probably be more lucid about this if I had the time, but I don't.

Notes by an Avatartist


As avatartist, we are our avatar Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan and our
avatar is us, both controlled by motion-capture behaviors using remapped
sensors and moving at ultra-high-speeds among other avatars, landscapes,
virtual worlds in the real, online, in one's mind.

But our avatar is unique, our avatar is tissue, our avatar transforms
backwards and forwards at perceptually instantaneous speed between frames.
Our avatar is alien.

Jennifer: "our avatar has slimy avatar movement, wormlike shape-shifting,
at warp high-speed perceptually conflated with itself, our avatar is
speed-alien, malleable and originating tissue. as originating, our avatar
is demiurge, producing and reproducing, originating worlds and gatherings
of the true world."

Julu: "our avatar is disparaged body or bodies, our avatar is OTHERING,
here and there moving asymptotically among fractal intrusions, our avatar
prepares the appearance of twisted connected topologies, limit-sets of
behaviors, topological counterexamples and distraught spaces piled upon
themselves at warp-high speed."

Nikuko: "our avatar is implicate orderings, twisted among themselves,
still connected or with connections' memory, tangled as if untangled,
messed as if unmessed, abject, as if clarified, our avatar is cephalic or
ocular, eyes and doubling eyes, gendering and originating, producing and
reproducing."

Travis: "our avatar is detritus machine, residue-machine, with symbolic
input, language input, bvh input, ascii input, inchoate output, our avatar
is ALIEN-BETTER-LEFT-UNDEFINED, that is _alien << inchoate_, symbols
effaced by behavior-gatherings, the true world, asymbolia.

Alan: "our avatar is un-is, truly disconnected topologies, connectors gone
with interior body viewpoint, resulting sheaves, surfaces, in relative
positions, holding relative positions, but the manifolds are open, broken,
think of chimera composites."

Jennifer: "in other words, in the true world of gatherings, our avatar is
open and gathering from within, closed and coherent from without, as-if
our avatar, as if Jennifer-Julu-Nikuko-Travis-Alan, as-if but not as-if,
not really, in the true world really a gathering."

Julu: "in other words, we are true world being."

Just as Pound found a totalitarian impulse deeply seeded in Kung,
so too it seems China is--I'd say--returning to its past.

Once again, looking at Pound is a way to versteyen.

Sorry to rain on the parade here -- but Lessing hasn't written anything of interest (or even quality) in approximately 30 years.  I imagine she's receiving the award for the Martha Quest series, "The Golden Notebook" and maybe "Briefing for a Descent into Hell."

And what's the Nobel Committee doing awarding prizes to an array of white writers from Africa and leaving out Black sub-Saharan writers?  Gordimer and Coetzee from South Africa, and now Lessing, who spent most of her early life in what is now Zimbabwe.  What kind of message does this send?  (I think some of us know the answer to that one.)

Subject:      Paul Lauritzen's Door
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

My colleague Paul Lauritzen, a renowned ethicist and the director of Applied Ethics at John Carroll University, has never been one to hide his political views. As long as I've been at the university (I began just weeks before September 11th, 2001), Lauritzen employed his office window and door as a political palette, an alternative news wall that would extend and project itself into the spaces of the academy so frequently denuded of such viewpoints. One of my favorite extensions of language into the academic space was when he used a LCD projection screen to cast upon the white wall in the hallway just across from his office the cost of the war in dollars--a dizzying number forever spiralling that the passerby literally would have to step through as s/he walked down the hall.

(Apropos of denudations--I've almost given up flyering for poetry readings, because the clean-up crew apparently has been instructed to tear down flyers (even those who have received proper stamps for posting) unless they appear on seven sanctioned postboards, which, as far as I can tell, exist only in the corners of buildings. In an age of information bombardment, it is increasingly difficult to penetrate the defended consciousness of the average college student, who is so bedraggled by coursework, jobs, love troubles, text messages, and the like, that they are lucky to remember their own names.)

In any case, Lauritzen's door became the object of controversy when an anonymous tip was called into "Ethics Point," reporting that Lauritzen had something inflammatory on his door. It was a sign that said, IMPEACH BUSH. Human Resources stepped in, and removed the sign, then emailed him to say why it happened--they interpreted a university policy in such a way that would make such signage forbidden.

Faculty Council intervened on his behalf, and Lauritzen met with John Carroll's in-house council, Maria Alfaro-Lopez, to gain clarification about the policy, and some indication in writing that he was not violating policy and that the party who reported it would be informed of the university's support of his free speech. In Lauritzen's words,



The current situation is fairly Orwellian. I have been told that the original email [from Human Resources] was in error. I have asked to receive in writing a statement to that effect, but have been told that there is a university policy, but no agreed upon interpretation of it that would either permit or forbid me to post a sign. The upshot is that Maria would not put in writing that no university policy prevented me from posting my "Impeach Bush" sign. She agreed to put something in writing to the effect that there is no agreed upon interpretation of university policy, but she has not yet sent that to me.


There was some effort to suggest that the individual faculty member's door was theirs to use as they saw fit, but that the door of an "institution" such as Applied Ethics might be inappropriate. This seems like hair-splitting, yet the questions that arise regarding a faculty member's rights to express viewpoints that may be inflammatory--the very rights upon which academic freedom is based--are in question.

One might say that the "IMPEACH BUSH" did exactly what it was meant to do--to shake someone into doing something about it. Calling Ethics Point was not the intended action, but it compelled someone to respond, to attempt to use institutional power against this voice within the institution. So frequently, those who dissent become the object, ad hominem, of the ire of those their language disturbs. There is indeed a place for language that disturbs, that unsettles.

Lauritzen's new sign, posted above, is a poem from Miguel de Unamuno, and offers a subtler but no less defiant stance against those who attempt to bully people into silence. The message, now, extends not only to the President, but to those who wish to silence Lauritzen. It is a political language that might perplex rather than inflame, yet one which seems as necessary as ever.

If and when Lauritzen returns to more fact-based rhetorical means, we at John Carroll will be none the poorer. It is possible that our arguments benefit from a kind of oscillation between the interpellative invitation of the Martin Luther Kings, and the threatening fist-shaking of the Malcolm Xs--a kind of Hegelian dialectic of protest. We need to be unsettled and we need to be invited, in order to shake ourselves from the trance of this war, and all the arguments summoned to continue it.

on Creeley. Actually an essay written some=20
20-plus years ago, not published, that I didn't=20

writing and remember as critical not so much to=20
understanding Creeley as to thinking about=20
a  possible poetics / italicized interventions=20
and meanderings  made in september 2007

I  Inarticulacy: Inside the Parentheses

the holes there / the holes I want there / the ability to wander
I might not say inarticulate anymore / rather=20
open to multiple articulations / there is no such thing as blank space

Robert Creeley=92s writing lacks clarification; it=20
lacks a subject. In ordinary discourse, literary=20
or otherwise, we usually know the center of=20
attention. We know what we are talking about; we=20
have a subject. In a piece of writing by Creeley,=20
poem or story, we stand on no such common ground.=20
If only he would explain, we might think: even a=20
clarification such as a parenthetical remark=20
could give. But no such assurance is given. The=20
inside of the parenthesis is inarticulate. The=20
ground we stand on quakes. The speaker is not=20
sure, even about what we might take to be a simple relationship.
I think I know, I think I know about what she=92d=20
do if this or that happened, if I were to say=20
this to her, or something about something, or=20
what people usually talk about.  (GD 25)
In these lines from =93Mr. Blue,=94 much of the=20
characteristic stance of the voice in Creeley=92s=20
writing reveals itself. It is instructive to=20
examine carefully how this utterance shapes=20
itself, or how it does not shape itself. Not =93I=20
know,=94 but =93I think I know;=94 and not =93I think I=20
know=94 simply and firmly (as firmly as =93think=94=20
might allow), but followed by a hesitancy and a=20
repetition. When we finally are allowed a more=20
expansive phrasing, we see not =93I think I know=20
what she=92d do,=94 but =93I think I know about what=20
she=92d do.=94 Here not only infirmity reigns, but=20
ambiguity, in the word =93about,=94 one of the small=20
words of placement favored by Creeley. Does=20
=93about=94 join with =93I know=94 to suggest the speaker=20
understands the nature of what his wife would do,=20
or does it align with =93what she=92d do=94 to imply he=20
knows approximately what she would do? If such a=20
statement appeared in a Creeley poem, we might=20
expect =93about=94 either to be interrupted during=20
its utterance by a line break, or to occupy a=20
line by itself, unable to securely lend its=20
weight either to what precedes or to what=20
follows. The ambiguity in the story leads not to=20
the consideration of a specific cause that might=20
stimulate an action by the wife, rather to the=20
less specific =93if this or that happened, if I=20
were to say this to her, or something about=20
something, or what people usually talk about.=94=20
Such generality. Everything is relative, left=20
open to chance, as we gather by the proliferation=20
of words that suggest such relativity: if, this,=20
or, that, something, about, usually, etc., some=20
of these words appearing more than once. The=20
entire sentence stands as merely one example of=20
the ways in which a highly ordered language can=20
say very little, yet suggest, in the manner of=20
its inarticulacy, an insecure stance toward=20
reality. Robert Creeley appears devoted to a=20
reality, to existence as an emotional state, the=20
emotions disordered in that they do not lend=20
themselves to clear exposition; but the language=20
is highly ordered. In a controlled manner,=20
Creeley=92s speaker manifests his lack of control.

what is this balance / order & control / lack of=20
control /  a space we can enter /  a space left open

Lack of control, or lack of power, is the subject=20
in Creeley=92s writing. It is not stated, rather it=20
is the inside of the parentheses which we are not=20
given. =933 Fate Tales=94 opens with an oblique=20
approach that suggests such lack of control as it=20
shows that an identity is beyond the capacity of the speaker.
I put it this way. That I am, say, myself, that=20
this, or this feel, you can=92t have, or from that=20
man or this, me, you can=92t take it. And what I=20
would do, with any of this, is beyond you, and=20
mine. But for this time, yours too. (GD, 45)

The shiftings of ungrounded language are typical=20
of the openings of Creeley stories. He places us=20
in a quandary at the opening of =93In The Summer.=94

I am not saying that it was ever to the point or=20
that a purpose could be so neatly and unopposedly=20
defined. Or that twenty-one or so years ago, on=20
that day, or on this, he was then, or is now,=20
there or here, that we could know him and see him=20
to be what he is. I don=92t much care for that. I=20
had my own time to do, a number of things to do.=20
I had heard, then, that the growing-up of=20
anything could become an involved and crippling=20
process. I could see the sun each day, coming up,=20
and then each night, going down. I gave my time to that.

At this point a reader might throw up his or her=20
hands in dismay at not having a clue as to the=20
subject of the story. Yet Creeley achieves much=20
in this beginning, though it may not be perceived=20
during an initial reading. He approaches, as=20
closely as he ever will, statement of the prosaic=20
subject: the effect of the past on the present,=20
the debilitating process of maturing. More=20
importantly, he dramatizes, in a voice, the true=20
subject of the story and of all of Creeley=92s=20
stories: the insecurity and insubstantiality of being.

ungrounded? / perhaps it=92s when language stops=20
functioning as symbol and begins to function as=20
field, that it is precisely grounded, and grounds=20
us, in community / walter benjamin=92s dream of a=20
language that can=92t mean but that can ground us

We learn much about Creeley=92s writing if we read=20
it as growing one word at a time. In this=20
excerpt, first comes =93I,=94 the central actor in=20
many works by Creeley; the more we read him, the=20
more autobiographical we see his writing to be.=20
At least we see it as an exploration of what=20
existence means to its author. Second, =93I am,=94=20
the statement of existence, simply, without hint=20
of what that existence might signify. Third, =93I=20
am not.=94 Now all is taken away in typical=20
Creeleyesque fashion. Give us something to hold,=20
then make it disintegrate in our hands. Are we=20
even dust in the wind? Fourth, =93I am not saying=94:=20
precisely the message Creeley=92s writing carries=20
forth to the world. He is not saying anything; he=20
can not say anything. He can only show, in his=20
manner of utterance, what he is, and we can not=20
even put a firm finger on that. Creeley orders=20
his writing immaculately, even at times like=20
this, word by careful word; and the order reveals=20
his essential inarticulacy and insecurity. The=20
remainder of the opening paragraph develops the=20
insecurity, full of Creeley shiftings. We shift with him, nervously.

does all writing grow one word at a time / are we words or ideas?

One can begin anywhere in reading Creeley: with=20
the poems, the stories, the novel, the letters=20
and essays. When I first began, I read the poems;=20
when I later read the stories I was stunned to=20
find the same rhythms there, the same tones, as=20
if these were not fictions at all, merely more=20
Creeley, writing. Thus I tend to minimize the=20
formal and generic distinctions between his=20
works, while recognizing what can not be missed,=20
the stylistic similarities, the common sense of phrasing, of language.

By looking at a poem we can see how there, too,=20
he is inarticulate and maintains a tenuous hold on subject, on the world.
SPEECH

Simple things
one wants to say
like, what=92s the day
like, out there=AD
who am I
and where. (B, 101)
read another way entirely, what a joyful poem!=20
who am I=ADcan=92t that be a question that lifts one?=20
or be heard as a cry of freedom?

Like the stories, =93Speech=94 leaves us with more=20
questions than answers. Return to the title; is=20
the poem a speech? Or is it about speech? It is=20
both and neither. It implies more than most=20
orators say in a speech, but it says little. It=20
suggests much about the act of speaking and the=20
difficulty of saying anything, yet it explicitly=20
tells us nothing about speaking (implicitly it=20
tells us much). It is more carefully ordered than=20
is most rhetoric, but does not really make=20
points. In what sense is it even a poem? It makes=20
of rhyme a complex music, but is devoid of=20
metaphor and metonymy. On the other hand it=20
magnificently satisfies modernist poetry=92s demand=20
for economy and concision, in that it means much=20
while saying little. Pound might demand this of a=20
poem; yet Pound also said =93only emotion endures=94=20
in poetry, and this poem=92s language seems to lack=20
emotion. But Pound is not Creeley=92s only mentor.=20
Another, Louis Zukofsky, has said that in poetry=20
=93emotion is a matter of cadence.=94 In this way, in=20
its manner of saying, in its total articulation=20
of sound, Creeley=92s poem is emotional, although=20
the emotions are difficult to define.

ahh / so young here / aren=92t emotions always=20
difficult, no impossible, to define / or, do they=20
exist? are they chemical? who am I / and where

The poem is not simple at all, as its first line=20
might lead us to believe; speech is not simple.=20
One wants to speak, even to define oneself, but=20
can not know, with security, what the day is=20
like, one=92s own location, or even his identity.=20
In such an encumbered position, and such a human=20
situation, how difficult it is to speak. How is=20
the difficulty achieved, the tentativeness=20
manifested, in this poem? Like the utterances in=20
stories, it shows in the words which can not be=20
specific: one, things, what, there, who, where.=20
It shows in the stops, in the inability to=20
continue easily. We pause at line breaks, after=20
=93things,=94 not certain what things they are; we=20
pause after =93day,=94 left with the question =93what=20
is the day,=94 yet we are made to continue,=20
haltingly, to say =93like.=94 The end-line hyphen=20
after =93out there=94 leads us directly into a void,=20
not a =93there=94 but a =93nowhere.=94 As in Creeley=92s=20
stories, we also pause with quick commas. Here=20
they come immediately after we begin lines, both=20
times after the word =93like.=94 Finally, we do not=20
even know what the day is like, much less what it=20
is; and we do not know specific things, but=20
things =93like=94 the examples given, the =93like=94=20
implying that many more subjects could be=20
included in what we might want to say but can not=20
know how to say. There is no stated subject to=20
the poem; it is not the =93simple things,=94 it is=20
the inability to know or speak, which is enacted rather than stated.

is dislocation another name for this / or nomadic

The poem presents still more difficulties. It=20
seems unable to say things, so it poses its words=20
as questions; but we are not sure they are=20
questions, for there are no question marks. We=20
end with a period which concludes nothing. The=20
sounds of the poem, highly ordered, imply no such=20
order in the speaker=92s mind or in the world. We=20
hear end rhymes (say/day, there/where), internal=20
rhymes (like/like, wants/what=92s). We hear closely=20
matched sounds and rhythms in the second and=20
third lines, similar phrasing breaks in the third=20
and fourth lines, identical syllable counts in=20
the fourth and fifth lines. The poem masterfully=20
builds its verbal music. It exhibits all the=20
hesitancies and insecurities of a Creeley story,=20
yet is so compressed. Because of the compression=20
we see what is present but much less obvious in=20
the stories: the tightly ordered language. If=20
modern life is full of fragments shored against=20
ruins, Creeley=92s language is composed of=20
carefully arranged fragments that barely hold,=20
while showing the impending ruin of annihilation=20
in a void of instability. The flux of living is=20
everywhere in Creeley=92s writing; it can not be=20
understood; all one can do is show the difficulty=20
of finding one=92s place in the midst of it. With=20
language, put a fence around the subject, which=20
is the difficult existence of the self.

         "Longest way round is shortest way home," as one learns in
James Joyce's Ulysses.  And so the discussion has come back to the
opposition of the original title--"El Spontaneo/"craft.'"  Only now
re-formulated in terms of the "process/product" either/or conundrum
which seems to endlessly haunt American poetics (which can be a form
of "tradition," in itself).
        On the one hand the spontaneous--which one might say comes
from Whitman and Dickinson (and the influence even indirectly of
Emerson)--and on the other the "Urn," which fittingly has its origins
with the funereal theses of Poe regarding "craft."
        In his "Philosophy of Composition," Poe is arguing against the
Romantic ideal of the spontaneous, divinely inspired poem--and for the
uses of a method which depends on deduction.  That is--first one
determine what is the desired effect the poem is to cause--and then
one works backward to determiinng what elements are necessary in order
to construct a "machine made of words" (think of all the hoaxing
machines in Poe!) which will produce the desired effect.
         Poe is struggling also with himself in this essay, as,
fearing madness, he is working feverishly to demonstrate rationally
that he is not mad, not Romantically or Gothically spontaneously
inspired by delusions, dreams, delirium tremens, but is simply cooly
calculating  the construction of a well thought out and crafted "urn."
        Of course, Poe wrote the poem ("The Raven") that he is
describing the calculated method composition of, well before he
produced the essay.
       So the "urn" Poe is writing of is not recollected in
tranquility in the poem, but in the essay elaboration of its
composition.  Which is of course a very well composed piece essaying a
demonstration that a poem already written was in fact done by an
elaboration of a clearcut method of composition, by a rational force
at work moving via deductions to the creation of a perfected--and
highly popular--product known for its singular effects.
         This is a very intersting debate of Poe with himself--because
it illuminates the process/product conflicts as one of a matter of the
self and public images of the Poet and his lifetsyle, which seems for
many to be involved with the differences between what Creeley's poetry
"seems" to "represent" in life and that which Simic's form of poetry
is "seen" to "represent" as its opposite.
         "The Raven" seems to be a very "inspired" poem, with all the
trappings of the lurid and ominous, all the set design trappings of
future Vincent Price vehicles (many of them based on Poe stories and
this poem) and Poe's own "Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque."  Yet
Poe, in order that he not be seen as the already growing caricature of
him as a "madman," a dope and drink fiend, a crazed German-import
imitation ("Terror is not of Germany but of the Soul"), deconstructs
all this stagey hokum and lays bare the cool, calm, calculated,
managed methodology of his "ratiocinating" detective Dupin in
"cracking the case" of his own composition.  In this manner, the
"crazed, spontaneous, drunken" Poe will be revealed to the world as
his 'real self," the brilliant creator of word puzzles, brain teasing
conundrums and hoaes which he alone can crack open--and in the
process, revealing the work as the perfect urn of a beautifully
crafted, immaculately solved equation.
         Poor Poe!  Rufus Griswold having charge of the immediate
"final word" re Poe, used precisely the features Poe most feared
against the "dead" Poet, thus creating the still lasting legend of the
poor, insane, drug and gin soaked hack who just happened in his
deliriums to have created the modern detective story, various branches
of science-fiction, the first "modern" american literary criticism and
the philosophical work "Eureka."  (Considered by Paul Valery,
mathematician and poet,  to be among the great achievements of Western
thought.) Yet In Poe death itself is never entirely certain--he
desires and often writes of a state between death and life--from which
the near-dead may of course become spontaneously or by various
para-scientific  means nearly-alive for their lovers and loved ones.
It is this suspended state, or simulations of it, which cause the
Freudian "work of mourning" in Poe to be turned into "mournful and
never ending remembrance." A remembrance which finds a very cruel
shock in the piece "Morning (mourning?) on the Wissihicaon," in which
what appears to be an idyllic Eden of the recent American past with
wild animals, an Indian, flora and fauna endangered by the urban
sprawl still in their wild state, turns out to be the well kept and
manicured estate of an Englsihman, a simulation of the "original
America," complete with the stocking of tamed animals and the hiring
of a servant to dress and Pose as an Indian for the benefit of those
who take a tourist trip down the waters of the Wissihicaon and are
able to take in  this living Panorama in full.
       At around the same time that Emerson is proclaiming "Nature" as
the great resource for the American poet to come, Poe is already seing
the coming of the Simulacra, the recreated ,reenacted, replacement of
Wildness with a carefully crafted simulation of it.  And even more
presciently, the owner is no longer in any way American, but a wealthy
Englishman, re-colonizing  the former Colonies, now the "Land of the
Free" via privatized purchase and the reconstruction of an already
vanished "America." The "American dream" is already a privately owned
outdoor museum along the lines of "Colonial Williamsburg" and service
workers are acting the part of "wild American Indians." You will
become tourists in your own States of suspension between life and
death in a world of simulations of your former Emersonian "original
relationship with the universe" is Poe's "mournful and never ending"
concept of the "remembrance" by the present and future for its now
"virtual" "past."
(At least Proust had a madeleine with which to time travel! Something
tangible with which to open the "recherce du temps perdu.")
          In other words, spontaneity has already become something
which is simulated, a virtual re-enactment of "Freedom" and
"originality"  while al the while being in the service of the Private
sector.  The idea that "spontaneity" is a refusal of
"bureacratization" for Poe is already a thing of the past. The
function of bureaucracies has become to preserve the free market
privatized illusion of Freedom embodied in its simulations.
Bureaucracies and institutions  in fact become the places in which are
preserved and taught the methods of simulating "spontaneity,"
"freedom," "non-conformity," "radical, innovative" "oppositional" work
of "resistance, rupture, transgression" and the like.
        From this view point, the process/product either/or of the
Creeley/Simic opposition becomes much more complex, entering the
realms of such things as "processed cheese," "procesed hair," "meat
by-products," "a product of the University/School/Institutional
system," and the like.   The poem of process--is a poem designed to
create an effect of process.  It sets out to use a methodology which
"creates process" as indeed its product. The process=the product and
is fetishized just like a commodity.   "What you see is what you get."
In the end it becomes an object--poem, series, book-- which "sheds
light on," or "demonstrates," or "performs" process.  The "finished
product" approach is  designed to create the effect of
immediately--rather than more leisurely-- being indeed a "well wrought
urn," a product with a "beautiful finish," or a "finsihed product
exhibting the skills and craft of the poet." One shows the signs of
craft at work, the other conceals it.
       The opposition of "selected" and "complete collected" works
falls into a similar dichotomy of the same coin.  On the one hand you
have the more "fast food" package of "greatest hits," and on the other
the "box set" complete with B-Sides, out takes, side-projects, the
rare, the "neglected nuggets," the "overlooked gems," demo tapes and
"previously unreleased" materials. The choice depends on how much one
has emotionally "invested" in the artist and their work, how much
time--and money-- one can "afford to spend" in study and scholarship,
"getting as close as possible to the voice" of the poet, musician,
film maker, performer.
        The questions of process/product, selected/complete are
questions of investments in "value" and time.  How much time are you
willing to spend--and how much money?--how much of yourself are you
"willing to give?" to "acquire a knowledge" of the poet and the
poetry? How mush is it one wants to expend and in what manner on one's
own work?  How much does one value one's own work as process? and how
much as product? Which commodity-form does on fetishize?
        The question of "value" then opens up the present debate over
"values" in a "lifestyle" choice between one of process and one that
is product oriented.  Or does it?  For isn't process in itself a form
of product in that that is what one is selling, or buying, investing
time and money in?  And product an erasure of its production which
then enters in to the production process of fetishes, desires, and the
like?   Each "side" feels that its own is of more "value" than the
other's in terms of "quality of life" or "quality of poetry," each
side feels "validated" by what they do and how they do it and what the
"result" is.
       In Poe's case his essay attempting to present a rational method
for  creating a product with a desired effect isn't only to do with
his wanting to appear "ultra-sane" rather than being portrayed as
"ultra-debauched" and inspired by "demon rum" and other evils,
including insanity, but also with a desired economic effect.  "The
Raven" was a mega super hit, taking off like wildfire and being
reprinted all over the US and in England  appearing in the obligatory
myriad pirated editions.  Since there was no copyright at the time
protecting American authors, Poe had to go on tour, not to promote the
hit, but to be able to get some of the lucre the hit was producing for
everyone but himself. The hit promoted his appearances, but didn't do
all that much for his own bank account.  However, if he could get to
the bottom of the method which had produced the hit, rationally
reconstruct his process--could he not in turn  keep on creating hits,
and find ways to better manage their profits coming to him in the
future? In short discover the alchemical poetic formula for success?
      That is, by finding a way to unite process and product under one
umbrella (Poe, Inc) could he not become a "hit factory?"  And market
both his process and his products? And if the market is slow in one
aspect, have simultaneously the other to help support oneself? Not to
mention his already major activities in the spheres of criticism and
reviewing, for which he was badly underpaid?  (He was the first
American poet to simultaneously gain fame as a critic/reviewer--known
to his public as the "tommy hawk man" for his ferocious "hatchet
jobs."  He also, like reviewers/critics from time immemorial, indulged
in "puff pieces" promoting persons he wanted to get some advantages
from--money, and, after his wife's death , marriage, status, stability
and the rest.)
        Poe's concern with process and product comes from both these
economic concerns and trying to unite what he feared was a cracked
mind.  His product (the essay)  attempts, not to "rediscover" the
process by which he  was making it, but to INVENT rationalized
explanations for what he fears may have been a spontaneous "one hit
wonder,"  the sign of his not being able to literally "depend on" (be
dependent on), either process or product.  Fearing cracks in the head
and the urns of his works, of his life as it appears to others, he
literally essays a process of inventing a process of producing a
flawless object, a perfect and "golden" urn--or, as Henry James had
it, a "Golden Bowl" whose cracks open up the process by which the
heroine in the novel of that name develops an art neither of process
or product, but of awareness, an art of consciously "seeing" with the
cracks, not in spite of them.

   In the opening pages of the Golden Bowl, set in London,  James has
the Italian Prince affianced to the American heroine wondering about
Poe's "Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym" as a sign that Americans are,
indeed, possesed of imagination, because of the veilings  and curtains
of whiteness through which the giant figure of whiteness (of Outward?)
 is seen in the vertiginous approach to the South Pole and the "white
out" of the Narrative's ending:

       "March 22  The darkness had materially increased, relieved only
by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before
us. Many gigantic and pallidly white birds flew continuously now from
beyond the veil . . . And now we rushed into the embraces of the
cataract, where a chasm threw itself open to receive us. But there
arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure, very larger in its
proportions than any  dweller among men.  And the hue of the skin of
the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow."

      (A kind of "ghostly" premonition of the White Whale--and an
echoing of the mysterious--(exagerated and invented)--  giant statured
"Patagonians" who gambol wildly and haunt the pages of 17th and 18th
Century travel literature.)

      This seeming "ending" of the  "Narrative" in the whiteness of a
final blankness of the page, is  followed by the ensuing "Note"  which
is a series of un/re/veilings of authorship, narration, verisimilitude
and fictions, and also presents the interpretations of the figures in
the chasms found on/in the all Black inhabited, all Black rock
forested island of Tsalal, whose message is: "I have graven it within
the hills, and my vengeance within the dust upon the rock."
     In his great essay "A Sedimentation of the Mind: Earth Projects,"
Robert Smithson writes:  "(Pym) seems to me excellent art criticism
and the prototype for rigorous 'non-site' investigations . . . His
descriptions of chasms and holes seem to verge on proposals for
'earthwords.'  The shapes of the chasms themselves become 'verbal
roots' that spell out the differences between darkness and light."
       The trajectory of Poe, James and Smithson through veilings,
curtains, whitenesses and blacknesses,  "darkness and light," with
sites/sights/sites of rock, water, snow, chasms, and the "non-sites"
of their presentations as "prototypes" of "'earthwords'" and "'verbal
roots,'" is guided by cracks, chasms, fissues in "the sedimintations
of the mind," the golden bowl and Poe's strugglings with process and
product, sanity and insanity, poverty and treasure of "The Gold Bug"
which has bitten him.
       For Smithson it is in the cracks that the artist finds opening
"the art of looking" in time. This is not a process that is set down,
set out upon, as is a poem being written/read in "cultural
confinement,"  nor a product in which the "time of the artist" is
imprisoned and sold to the highest bidder as an "art object."

 "Critics, by focusing on the 'art object." deprive the artist of any
existence in the world of both mind and matter . . . . Art, in this
sense, is considered 'timeless' or a product of 'no time at all", this
becomes a convenient way to exploit the artist out of his rightful
claim to his temporal processes . . . . there is only an uncertain
disintegrating order which transcends the limits of rational
seperations . . . the brain itself resembles an eroded rock from which
ideas and ideals leak . . . A great artist can make art by simply
casting a glance.  A set of glances could be as solid as any thing or
place, but the society continues to cheat the artist out of his 'art
of looking,' by valuing only 'art objects.' . . . Many would like to
forget time altogether, because it conceals 'the death principle'
(every authentic artist knows this.)"

       I think that the dichotomy of process/product Creeley/Simic
misses the deeper questions of time and what spontaneity and craft are
involved with.  One can be after all a professional of spontaneity,
and a routine performer of the leap of El Spontaneo, just as one can
use craft to create an effect of the spontaneous.  Or use spontaneity
to create an illusion of craft, of the "well wrought urn." Is the
consciousness of working with process any less of a craft than the
making of the well wrought urn?  Isn't the argument over which is
"better for you" or "more worth your while"? And don't both ignore
"the uncertain disintegrating order"--
       That uncertain disintegrating order of the situation Poe is
facing, that the Golden Bowl's crack opens in the consciousness and
"art of looking" of the heroine," that the eroded rock brain of
Smithson's "sedimentations of the mind" is leaking, is where one finds
that "necessity is the motherfucker of invention," and that the
"verbal roots" existing in "earthwords" are rhizomatic, in Deleuze and
Guattari's formulation, rather than a "tree of knowledge" or "American
tree."
        In this situation, it is the existence of the poet/artist that
is cracking open in time to "an art of looking" which "transcends
rational separations" such as process/product, which are each ways of
valuing  the same thing (a poem, a book) is made into/as an object.
The process-as-product or the product-that-conceals -the-process take
different trains to the same station.  One may be more ecologically
minded than the other, or more clean, or more "open," but they are
both known to be "safe" as made clear by the endless big business of
their debates, of they're  both being professionally taught,
anthologized, analyzed, trumpeted, supported by endowments, chairs,
grants to go work elsewhere than one's  place of residence and the
like.
       After all, part of the discussion seems to be the need to
"produce an answer/contrary opinion/deconstruction-destruction" of
Simic's piece for the NYRB.  "Cry havoc, and let loose the dogs of
war!!"
        Meanwhile the world of cracks goes on all around one, training
grounds "literally"  for "the art of looking"  found in the rubble
that the cracks open of/in/with  "the uncertain disintegrating order."
In these areas of debris and refuse is to be found the "art of
looking" with which to refuse "rational separations" which endlessly
lead to wars over the ownership, control of legacies, interpretations,
claims, counter claims, ethical-intellectual property and propriety of
who is "worthy" of the mantle of the dead and are their rightful heirs
and who alone should be allowed to speak in the name of the--Father?
the Country?  the Mother Tongue?  of Language? of Poetry? of Statues &
Statutes? The world of Borders Books and Border fences, Walls of gated
communities and prisons and whole peoples? Of the institutions of
Higher Learning? of Higher Earning or Higher Ideals? of Careers and
Professions? Bibles & Bibliographies?-----
        Thats what one wants to do "in the name of Creeley?"


        The figure of Robert Creeley i will remember is the Figure of
Outward, via a Figure who was this to both of in our ways.   In his
Autobiography Creeley wrote of one of the most important figures in
his life having been Ira Grant, who taught him much more than how to
raise chickens while living New Hampshire in the 1940's.  Creeley
wrote how Ira taught him much that was to be in Creeley's sense of
existence and work.  A quarter century after Bob's experience, i was
an apprentice house painter with Ira, (who had moved permanently to
Vermont), whom i had known since age of six.  Many lifetimes later,
reading the Autobiography, i found this connection.  By then Ira was
in his nineties, still out walking briskly in all weathers, and my
mother would send news of him to pass on to Bob.  That a person who
taught us each completely different trades having nothing seemingly to
do with poetry and yet ever so much of what went into both our work
and character, to me that is what I think of with Bob Creeley.
     The figure of Outward is the unexpected one that one finds
literally "out of necessity," not by a seeking process or a craft that
creates perfect urns, but by finding and being found by that which is
necessary, necessity, and from  that encounter with the motherfucker
of invention--doing that which one is "given to" doing.

Gordimer and Coetzee from South Africa, and now Lessing, who spent most of her early life in what is now Zimbabwe. What kind of message does this send?

i do agree about the lack of non-white african writers, absolutely.  but
not that she hasn't written anything worthwhile in the last 30 years.  her
shikasta series is brilliant.  she continues a dedicated politically aware
point of view without falling into being pc.  i love that, asked why she
had started writing fantasy, she answered something like, "look around
you."  all best, g

Lessing hasn't published anything of interest in the last thirty years?
This past summer I read Lessing's *Dairies of Jane Somers*, published in 1984. I found the first of the two books in that volume to be something really unique--a book about old people, especially old women, especially impoverished, lonely old women. There's candor and insight about the body, pride, invisibility, disgust, shit, hunger, shame, and class throughout.

I wouldn't think the Nobel Committee or many others, would find poor old women of interest. I'm glad Lessing did.

(By the way, Lessing first published these volumes under a pseudonym and in the intro to the edition I read, she talks about the dismissive editorial responses to a manuscript like this seemingly written by a literary "nobody".)

For Ruth and anyone else interested in Fully Awake: Black Mountain
College, it is available on DVD for $14.99 at

http://www.filmbaby.com/films/2055

We screened it to a full house in Buffalo last night with Cathryn
Davis, one of the directors, present.  Those looking for a lot of
footage of Black Mountain superstars are likely to be disappointed,
but those interested in a well-constructed, entertaining and
informative 60-minute history of the college, its educational
philosophy, and its impact on those that belonged to the community
will find just that. Also of note, the filmmakers are not "on the
make" on the film scene and want most of all to provide opportunities
for people to view the film.  If you would like to screen Fully Awake
in your town or city, they are very accommodating.  Contact info is
on the film's website:

	Newlove was the best of us, the great line, the hidden agenda,
	tough as nails and yet somehow with his heart on his sleeve.
	There was always a double-take involved when reading his work.
	His lyrics, such as "The Weather" were faultless. I devoured
	and loved his work.

Instructive re: the Simic discussion. Brouwer understands Notley's
poems in terms not too dissimilar to Simic's understanding of Creeley
post-1975, but what Simic dismisses he makes the focus of his praise.

Maybe we should set up an African Academy on par with Nobel. Then said
academy can pick from it's continent, and Sweden can pick from theirs!

 That (above)  is his web page. Which, in addition to links to samples of Trevor's work, has his upcoming East Coast and Canada schedule.

perhaps the most interesting curve is the Witch of Agnesi, which is a
mistranslation of "to turn" and was first written about by the first
female mathemetician to write

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WitchofAgnesi.html  has an animation

you will have more luck looking for "special curves"

the avatartist


the avatartist do not know where they are gathering. to be sure, they are
gathering in the true world, there is much talking among them which is a
murmuring to ourselves and sometimes there are phonemes as if there are
words for others. whispering words for others is gifting which we do not
do very often, sometimes we will write them letters from which they may
choose to find words or meanings of words, we do not know, we are in the
way gathering.

the avatartist have autonomic systems. they move without thinking now we
move. they move from an interior they do not know. they feel the interior.
the avatartist are feeling a gathering or party. they murmur without
thinking. they know they have root-body. sometimes they are near their
root-body, sometimes within. sometimes they disappear to themselves. they
can return to their root-body. an avatartist feels the wind blow through.

the avatartist know the whole world is the true world. they see beneath
things and see within things. they know closed manifolds are broken. they
know the aggregates of forms and materials, aggregates of words and sense
impressions. they know powers and gods are gatherings of broken manifolds,
that all manifolds are broken. they understand relation and dependent co-
origination, that cause-effect are mute. they suffer the world and the
suffering of the world.

the avatartist produce by existence, beings/s and being/s merge, meld,
enumerate and efface through root-bodies, protocols, cosmological struc-
tures. they filter screens and screenings. they know being and beings are
always filters. they know the avatartist are filters that create filters.
they know the disappearing-disappearance within oneselves.

the avatartist are of no mode, no moment, no movement, no stasis, they are
of no style, no medium, no aggregation, no one or many of six senses, no
senses. the avatartist are filtering and gathering, and releasing filter-
ing, and collocating gathering. the avatartist are open sets that are open
and closed and the very finest of discrete topologies transforming and
filtering gatherings and gathering filterings.

the avatartist are all space, all time, visible, invisible, transparent,
translucent, of here and there opaque, they murmur we are all avatartist,
are of saying nothing, whispering nothing, murmuring nothing, all in the
true world. the avatartist are writing this, us, them, there, here, now,
then, they are writing this-us-them-there-here-now-then, they are writing
and writing, they are writing nothing. whispering words for others is
gifting which we do not do very often, sometimes we will write them let-
ters from which they may choose to find words or meanings of words, we do
not know, we are in the way gathering. we are gathering, we are not in the
way, we are the way, we are, gathering and filtering.

gathering and filtering we are the avatartist, filtering and gathering.

Thanks very much, Catherine. Yes, that's a good one.

Agnesi is apparently the first to have mathematical writing survive which
was known to be written by a woman. I remember reading that the Pythagorean
brotherhood of Greece admitted women on an equal basis. Then why was it
called a brotherhood? Anyway, it seems highly likely to me there were other
women writing mathematics earlier than Agnesi in 1748. But it seems none
earlier has survived, unless there was a George Elliot or, like Archimedes's
manuscript 'On Method', such a document may be found as a palimpsest.
Evatosthenes?

By the way, Marko Niemi has sent me a family of exotic curves also. The
'rose curves' of r=cos(k*theta). These types of curves are especially useful
because the shape of the curve remains on screen for all values of theta.

I see that the wolfram site is, of course, a great source for such
information; thanks again.

 Laura Ulewicz
 Detroit,Michigan, May 1930 - Locke, California,  October 2007

 Within One Temperate Zone (2)


It wasn't on the map. heat stalled the car
At the valley or base of the 10th hill. Lost.
A post office side the town of San Sinduda. Not
On the map. I asked Carl, "Who do you suppose
has ever climbed that hill?" In a thousand
Years maybe one Indian. A ranch-hand
After cattle. A bull after a cow.
Two boys in black jeans leaned against a log fence
Playing a pocket radio and cursing
Loud to beat the vastness down. A matter
Of will and hot jazz. I said, "It's pretty
Tame here" -  being, of course, wrong. I might
Have meant "too wild with people". And so
 we climbed,
Until the car should cool, more to escape
Noise than to discover. That seconded
The wrong. Yet, pausing for breath on the ascent,
Carl told me how on his mother's grave in Concord,
While drunk, he first made love to another man.
In Concord - where the hills are monumented
With Hawthorne, Melville, Walden Pond, and our first
Revolution for severance - the fought one.
Now we looked eastward across a namelessness
Of hills. For beyond this one was another equal
In size, and beyond it another, until
Our minds, wanting to fix, were trapped in freedom.
Often I dream I open a hundred doors
And behind each door there is only another door.

From Jean-Pierre Balpe
Director
BIPVAL (Biennale Internationale des Poètes en Val-de-Marne)

For its tenth edition (May 2009), the International Poetry Biennial is
pleased to announce an International Media Poetry Contest.

Works considered "media poetry" are those that place contemporary
technologies at the service of poetry, be it within the framework of a
performance or in that of a recorded and projectable work. Among the many
forms accepted are included videopoetry, digital poetry, multimedia poetry,
sound poetry, interactive poetry, and poetic installations in physical space
or on the Internet. Works that illustrate a poem will not be considered
(these are works that use sound or images to represent or complement a poem,
for example). There are no restrictions regarding the form or content of the
media poems submitted.

Work presented shall not exceed 15 minutes and can be presented in the form
CD, DVD, or on the Internet.

Application: Candidates willing to submit their work to the International of
Media Poetry Contest shall express their intention via email before December
31st, 2007. To do so they shall write an email to:
direction@biennaledespoetes.fr

The works submitted shall arrive at the Poetry Biennial's office (11 rue
Ferdinand Roussel 94200 Ivry-sur-Seine France) before December 31st, 2008.
If the work is online, the Internet address shall arrive via email before
this date.

A jury made up of eleven international artists (see list below) will examine
the works and will allot the Media Poetry Prize 2009. The prize will be
given to the winner during a special ceremony to be realized during the
Poetry Biennial.

The prize winner will choose between being invited to Paris for one week
with all expenses paid during the Poetry Biennial or the equivalent amount
in cash.

Participation in the contest automatically authorizes the Biennial to
publicly exhibit submitted works. Unless otherwise specified, the copyright
of the works remains with the artists.

Jurors:
1.  Baboni-Schilingi Iacopo
2.  Beiguelman Giselle
3.  Benayoun Maurice
4.  Cayley John
5.  Chatonsky Grégory
6.  Chevalier Miguel
7.  Dumond Frédéric
8.  Giraudon Liliane
9.  Jaffrennou Michel
10. Kac Eduardo
11. Piringer Joerg

Please join us this Thursday, October 18th for "From Ritual to
Experiment: Robert Duncan and the Experimental Review," a lecture by
Dr. Jim Maynard. This talk will take place at 1pm in The Poetry
Collection, 420 Capen.

_The Small Press in the Archive Lecture Series_ dedicates itself to
the study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot.
The lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry
Collection, at SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse
formations, the status of ephemera and the making of genre, the
conditions of literary production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in
and between specific magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book
art, and how the little magazine functions in the making of the
avant-garde.

This event is funded by the Mildred Lockwood Lacey Fund for Poetry/The
Poetry Collection and is free and open to the public.

The National Poetry Foundation takes pleasure in announcing the next
in our sequence of "decades" conferences, to be devoted to the poetry
of the 1970s, American and international, and to be held from
Wednesday to Sunday, June 11-15, 2008, on the flagship campus of the
University of Maine System in Orono, Maine.

The NPF welcomes paper and panel proposals on any and all aspects of
poetic practice in the tumultuous decade of the 1970s. What emerged?
What suffered eclipse? What happened just out of frame? What
connections brought poetry into dialog with other fields? What social
and political contexts mattered most? What of the present can be
traced back to that moment? What poets, poetic formations, tendencies
in poetics warrant our continued attention? What accidents of
reception might we now revisit and perhaps repair?

As with previous NPF conferences, the scholarly presentation and
panels will be amply supplemented by a variety of poetry readings,
including plenary readings by notable figures associated with the
decade being explored. An exhibition of visual works is also planned.

Paper proposals consisting of a title and a brief (250-500 word)
abstract should be directed to Steve Evans either by e-mail (Steven
dot Evans at Maine dot Edu) or by regular mail (see address below).
Panel proposals should include, in addition, a brief rationale for
the envisioned grouping.

The deadline for submission of proposals is February 15, 2008. 	

More information about the Conference, including a list of keynote
speakers, registration costs, and suggestions for travel and
accommodations, will be available on-line at the NPF's new website,
currently in "beta" here http://www.nationalpoetryfoundation.org/.

We hope to see you in Orono this June!

Vernon Bellecourt--an inspiration & example whose spirit will live
always in the struggles of indigenous peoples world wide.

(on a recent democracynow, the President of Bolivia, the first
indigenous person elected to head a Sate, noted that the international
act of recognition of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples helped make his
election a reality.
     He also noted that four countries voted against these
recognitions of rights--
the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
        When the 14th Amendment was passed into Law in the USA, it
excluded American Indians from the recognition of Equal Rights. This
has influenced American Foreign policy worldwide, always supporting
settlers, colonists, repressive regimes against indigenous peoples.

Of course there was Soyinka -- however, he is increasingly a token presence on the list of Nobel laureates.  And there is/was Naguib Mahfouz.  But still...

And I know that Nobel Prizes are ostensibly awarded for "bodies of work."  Yet there are always signature works that stand out in importance -- Nelly Sachs's "O the Chimneys" and Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of Solitude," to mention a couple of examples.  And in Doris Lessing's case, "The Golden Notebook" is rightfully being cited as such an exemplary work.

Great news! They're stealing our books!

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Frankfurt Book Fair has an indicator to
help publishers gauge public interest in the new offerings presented
at the annual exhibition -- the unofficial "most stolen book" index.

Bild am Sonntag and Germany's ZDF television have come up with lists
of titles most stolen from 15 leading German publishers' stands set
up in the Frankfurt trade fair grounds.

"The most-stolen books are usually the most-sold later on," Claudia
Hanssen of the Goldmann Verlag publishing house told Bild am Sonntag
newspaper, which published a list of the 10 most stolen German-
language books this year.

"They're the popular ones and are most likely to end up on the best-
seller lists," Hanssen added.

The German translation of Nobel Peace prizewinner Al Gore's "An
Inconvenient Truth," outlining the dangers of global warming,
featured among the mainly German titles on the list.

More than 100,000 people attended the book fair, which ended Sunday.
There were 7,448 exhibitions where publishers from 108 countries
presented some 400,000 different books, videos and other products.

All:

Thanks again to those of you who have donated books
for the Tibetan Writers’ Collective, a project
providing Tibetan writers in exile with both resources
to promote the extension of voice access to
information.

This time I’d like to provide you with a little bit of
background info on McLeod Ganj. McLeod is located in
the Himalayan foothills in the north-western Indian
state of Himachal Pradesh. A town of about 2,000,
McLeod is comprised of Indians and Tibetans as well as
rugged travelers passing through. It is also the
official residence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and
the seat of the Tibetan Government in exile.

Every year hundreds of Tibetans cross the Indian
border from China in order to live in freedom and have
a better life. Many of them are children and young
adults whose parents send them to India to learn how
to read and write Tibetan and learn about Tibetan
culture. After arrival, they’re usually put through
schooling and from that point on they move on in
various directions and varying degrees of success.
Some stay in McLeod, some move to other parts of India
and a handful are able to emigrate.

During the past two years that I have been visiting
McLeod Ganj, I have met a number of talented
individuals who work on art and creative projects. I
have realized that one way to support them would be to
provide them with information and practical resources
so that the chances of them being heard are increased.
The Tibetan Writers’ Collective is one way to do so.

I have acquired books (in part, byway of the
generosity of members of this list) and computers for
the Collective. Additionally, I’ve asked Kathup
Tsering, a young Tibetan writer and member of PEN, to
assist in its operation. My next visit has been
scheduled for early 2008 and during this time I will
be setting up the library and workshop space. While my
return was originally scheduled for March, it has been
decided that I will be returning in February.

If any of you would like to donate books, magazines or
any other reading material, please send these to (or
backchannel for additional information):

DEMOSTHENES AGRAFIOTIS is active in the fields of
poetry/painting/photography/intermedia and their interactions, with
numerous books of poetry and essays and exhibitions of visual art both
in Greece and abroad. His anthology-formatted magazine 'Clinamen'
(1980-90), co-published by Erato Publications in Athens (1991-94), has
been active for over a decade as an amalgam of Greek poetry and art with
work from Europe and America. 7 artists books were published based on
'Clinamen' (1980-1995). Since 1996 'Clinamen' has continued production
of artists books (18), with a web version (
http://www.thetis.gr/services/clinamen) launched in 2001. He is also a
professor of Sociology at the National School of Public Health in
Athens, Greece, with many published writings on art and epidemiology. In
2004 his performance "A-Empedocles" was staged in the volcanic crater of
Sicily's Mt. Aetna.

DOLORES DORANTES was born in Veracruz in 1973 and has lived most of her
life in Ciudad Juárez, where socioeconomic violence and
politically-charged daily brutalities have informed her radically humane
and incisive cultural work. She has published four book-length works of
poetry, and is a founding member of the border arts collective Compañía
Frugal (The Frugal Company), which counts among its activities
publication of the monthly poetry broadside series Hoja Frugal, printed
in editions of 4000 and distributed free throughout Mexico. Regarding
that publication, Dorantes writes: "The Hoja Frugal is a project that
came into being on September 9, 2001 in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua (the
so-called 'crime frontier'). Our idea was to share the readings and
translations in which we as writers are engaged. But more than anything,
to share them with the community as a whole, not with the 'intellectual'
community. Our intention was to give the community a breath of respite
in the context of the growing phenomenon of violence we experience daily
in this border zone." Engaging this literary-political project from
another perspective, PUREsexSWIFTsex and September are books 2 and 3 of
Dorantes's lifelong project, entitled Dolores Dorantes.

KATIE EDMONDS is a San Francisco-based artist with a day job. Her work
has screened at the Berkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive Theatre
and various San Francisco galleries. Her ambition in life is to speak
about herself in the third person in a captivating and informative manner.

"Every creative genius appears opaque to most of his contemporaries.
This is true not just now, but throughout history, among every people.
And not just in art alone, but also in philosophy. In this way, we might
call contemporaneity a veil that comes between creative geniuses and
readers. But this veil is rent before the eyes of those who come
after."  --Adonis, tr. Elliott Colla

New on Joe Brainard's Pyjamas...a review of Yoko Tawada's The Bridegroom  was
a dog...and more stuff...

Tawada's stories often eroticize passivity, yet they don't seem to be about
sex so much as they are about solipsism. The narrators in her stories don't
really seem to believe in the world; the world is just a style the author is
somehow projecting onto the unfolding phenomena called by convention a "world,"
 and she is amused by what she perceives to be her own excesses, even when
these  include acts by others (or herself) which seem to shock more "rational"
people  around her, who, in true solipsist fashion, only exist as part of her
unfolding  narrative. In short, the author (and her narrators) seem to believe
it beneath  us, infradig, to apologize for the dream which is our life.

I wrote a course description for a mid-level undergraduate offering and
would like help, please, finding texts to live up to the catalog
description. Kin you help me? If you were going to teach this class,
what texts would you use:

"This is not a class in poetic forms. We will not be focusing on what a
sonnet is or how many lines are in a villanelle. We will instead read
poems that have incited revolutions, embarrassed nations, inspired
assassinations, that have helped found religious orders, and that have
become the backbone of various cultures throughout the history of
Indo-European letters. That is to say, we will explore poetry as a mode
of critical consciousness, as a means of cultural critique and symbolic
and social action. We will, in short, "get down" with what poetry is all
about: loving, hating, helping, hurting, destroying, and re-making the
world. Among other things, will look at poetry's roots not as a private,
nostalgic, cherished mode of utterance, but as a forceful and social
speech event, paying particular attention to poetry's origins in insult
and curse and praise. Much of the class will, on the one hand, explore
the poetry of ritualized insult, the poetry of invective, and, on the
other, the poetry of praise and benediction, the poetry of liturgies and
love making and spiritual epiphany. So, we will fundamentally approach
poetry (by both the reading of it and the writing of it) not as a
collection of aesthetic artifacts (called poems) that are to be
fetishized as a rarified form of precious speech uttered by special
beings (called poets), but as a socially ubiquitous, very serious, very
real, and often RILLY RILLY fun, means of making and re-making our
world--a kind of "world making" that all people do, from children to
popes to cops to students and professors."

 At one time my library consisted of mostly stolen books. Fortunately, this has changed, but not necessarily because I've grown morally. I've simply discovered libraries that sell books on the cheap, and I've taken to checking out books as well. I did have some ethics as I almost never stole from small independent stores. I had no mercy on Barnes & Vulgar or any of the large chain stores. During my twenties when I lived off of beer, tobacco & weed and had the sort of acne only a teen deserves,  I went through my Steal another Bukowski period. Seriously, I've stolen in the tens of thousand and I'm still tempted to exercise my craft as I'm a world class thief (the Good Lord gives us all certain gifts).

Great news! They're stealing our books!

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Frankfurt Book Fair has an indicator to
help publishers gauge public interest in the new offerings presented
at the annual exhibition -- the unofficial "most stolen book" index.

Bild am Sonntag and Germany's ZDF television have come up with lists
of titles most stolen from 15 leading German publishers' stands set
up in the Frankfurt trade fair grounds.

"The most-stolen books are usually the most-sold later on," Claudia
Hanssen of the Goldmann Verlag publishing house told Bild am Sonntag
newspaper, which published a list of the 10 most stolen German-
language books this year.

"They're the popular ones and are most likely to end up on the best-
seller lists," Hanssen added.

The German translation of Nobel Peace prizewinner Al Gore's "An
Inconvenient Truth," outlining the dangers of global warming,
featured among the mainly German titles on the list.

More than 100,000 people attended the book fair, which ended Sunday.
There were 7,448 exhibitions where publishers from 108 countries
presented some 400,000 different books, videos and other products.

The poem that immediately comes to mind, although it may not fulfill all the criteria presented here is William Carlos Williams' Paterson, a truly revolutionary poem in many ways.  Did it change the world?  No.  But what poem really has?  Of course, Ginsberg's Howl came close.  But I suspect you have that one on your list already.  Regards, Tom Savage

Against Forgetting: Twentieth-Century Poetry of Witness, edited by Carolyn Forche may be a book that would work for this class.  The poems are arranged chronologically (by war and/or other periods of social unrest), and I believe, geographically, as well.  Many powerful poems included.

Also, I've found the Vintage Book of Contemporary World Poetry edited by J.D. McClatchy to be full of just such poetry, simply because many "world" poets (whatever that term really means) live in nations that are or have been in political and social upheaval, which is reflected in the work.

Good luck.  Your description makes the course very appealing.

Guerrilla Warfare, Ernesto "Che" Guevara. I tossed it out the library window
then went around outside and picked it up.

Read within certain contexts, "How to pitch a lean-to" is great poetry.

Hello, Mr. Keckler, I just joined GoodReads at your suggestion.  When I saw my whole list of email addresses pop up, I didn't know what to do since none of these people have asked to be on GoodReads, I didn't feel I had the right to just add them.  I asked a question about The Sound and the Fury, which I am currently reading and which I don't understand.  It is the most confusing book of fiction I've read in many years.  I rarely know who is speaking or, even sometimes, what is happening in it.  Do you understand this book?  Does it become more comprehensible in the end?  Does anyone understand this book?  I realize that on some level it is easier to read than Finnegans Wake or Gertrude Stein but since it seems to have a linear narrative but may not, I expect different things from it.  Regards, Tom Savage

Tawada's stories often eroticize passivity, yet they don't seem to be about
sex so much as they are about solipsism. The narrators in her stories don't
really seem to believe in the world; the world is just a style the author is
somehow projecting onto the unfolding phenomena called by convention a "world,"
and she is amused by what she perceives to be her own excesses, even when
these include acts by others (or herself) which seem to shock more "rational"
people around her, who, in true solipsist fashion, only exist as part of her
unfolding narrative. In short, the author (and her narrators) seem to believe
it beneath us, infradig, to apologize for the dream which is our life.

Also, I just joined GoodReads as W.B.Keckler so if you're on there, please
add me as your friend and give me some good reading suggestions for poetry of
today or yestreen....merci!

Stole Burroughs and Gysin's THIRD MIND and Creeley's
THE CHARM. Never regretted it, but then they
(honestly) 'changed' my life - at least till reading
Kafka's METAMORPHOSIS (which my wife, then simply 'my
girl,' kindly purchased for me).

I would definitely select from the following: Kamau Brathwaite, the Chinese "Misty" poets, Martin Carter, South African poets from the apartheid era, Leon Damas, Aime Cesaire, the troubadours, William Blake, the Poem of the Cid, Osip Mandelstam, songs from the Paris Commune and the IWW and the Spanish Revolution of 1936, Amiri Baraka, Somali oral poetry, African-American toasts and boasts, Shmuel Ha-Nagid, Langston Hughes, Nicolas Guillen, Benjamin Peret, Angela Davis's book on blues women, Jayne Cortez, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Louise Bennett, and so on, and so on -- the possibilities are endless.  Yes, and the Popol Vuh, the Book of Chilam Balam, Jalauddin Rumi, Maria Sabina.  It's going to be a great course, judging from the description!

By the way, I sent this query to imitationpoetics-l a week or so ago,
and Murat and Pierre and Alex Dickow, Wystan Curnow, Julian Semilian,
Peter Davis, and Joe Safdie gave a lot of good suggestions already, but
I need more. The specific texts/authors suggested so far:

-Jerry's Technicians of the Sacred
-Aimes Cesaire's _Return to My Native Land_
-stuff in the Eda anthology
-Hazim Hikment
-Lale Müldür's poem "Waking to Constantinople," which, Murat remarked,
"caused a riot when the poet read it in a public park and was booed off
stage. Her vision of Istanbul as a two thousand year old city where the
five hundred year old Ottoman rationality is superimposed on a fifteen
hundred year of Byzantine dream world demanding a new synthesis was a
too disturbing an idea for the ultra nationalists and Islamic
fundementalists in the audience. It is an incredible poem of the kind I
think you are looking for"
-Murat also recommended k. Iskender's souljam
-Laurence Sterne's curse in Tristram Shandy
-Lyrical Ballads
-Early Adrienne Rich
-a book called _I Don't Have Any Paper, So Shut Up!_
-Bob Dylan, like "subterranean homesick blues" and "it's alright ma" and
"positively 4th street" and "idiot wind"
-Helene Cixous
-Robert Bly's 60s mojo
-the 1918 Dada manifesto
-BLAST
-Rimbaud
-Cendrars' Prose of the Transiberian
-Jacques Prevert's poem about the Kaiser with a finger up his ass
-Leon Gontran Damas' _Pigments_
-Shelley's "England in 1819"
-Neruda's "Canto General"
-Jack Hirshman's entire ouevre
-Dorn's _North Atlantic Turbine_

CHICAGO POETS READ FROM THE CITY VISIBLE

Cracked Slab Books (http://crackedslabbooks.com)
presents a reading by poets of its new anthology,
The City Visible: Chicago Poetry for the New Century.
This collection brings together a sampling of some of
the best poets working in Chicago and the surrounding
region.

Saturday, October 20th
from 7-10:30pm

Gethsemane Evangelical Church
3617 W. Belle Plaine Avenue
Chicago, IL
*CTA Irving Park Blue Line*
(1 block north of Elston & Irving Park intersection)

Readers include:
William Allegrezza, Ray Bianchi, Cynthia Bond, Garin
Cycholl, Eric Elshtain, Joel Felix, Chris Glomski,
Jennifer Karmin, Simone Muench, Peter O'Leary, Kristy
Odelius, Jorge Sanchez, Larry Sawyer, Robyn Schiff,
Kerri Sonnenberg, Tony Trigilio, Nick Twemlow, Johanny
Vázquez Paz, and Lina Vitkauskas

Admission is $5
$15 to receive a copy of the anthology
(retail value $22.95)

"When Carl Sandburg asked in his Chicago Poems, close
to a hundred years ago, for 'a voice to speak to me in
the day end, / A hand to touch me in the dark room /
Breaking the long loneliness,' little did he know his
city would be so fully and livingly answered and so
honored. Chicago is again transformed by poetry. Here
in these myriad acts of imagination, the poets of The
City Visible give to it again, in Shakespeare's terms,
:a local habitation and a name."
-- Peter Gizzi

"The most exciting and satisfying anthology I've
acquired in the past month is The City Visible:
Chicago Poetry for the New Century . . . It not only
is easily the best anthology I've ever seen that tried
to capture the lively scene of the Second City, but
it's a worthy companion to Stephanie Young's Bay
Poetics, which for my money is the gold standard in
contemporary poetry anthologies, especially ones that
offer a regional focus."
-- Ron Silliman

"Unveiling an entire new poetic culture may seem like
the act of a master magician, but Allegrezza and
Bianchi have been on the case a long time and they
know what they're doing. Volume Two is said to be in
the works, and in the meantime I for one will be
ordering several copies of Volume One for students,
friends, and family relations. When young poets ask
me, where should I go, what should I do, nowadays I
always say pull out a map, throw in a dart. X marks
the spot, but Chicago is the most exciting scene
around. Years from now we'll be looking back at the
early 21st century and wishing we'd all relocated
there at this time in poetry history."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China expressed fury on Tuesday
that the United States is to honor the Dalai Lama with
an award and warned that the activities of his
supporters were increasing in Chinese-controlled
Tibet.

The Dalai Lama, who has lived in exile in India since
staging a failed uprising against Chinese rule in
1959, is to receive the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal
on Wednesday after being hosted at the White House by
President George W. Bush.

"We are furious," Tibet's Communist Party boss, Zhang
Qingli, told reporters. "If the Dalai Lama can receive
such an award, there must be no justice or good people
in the world."

China, which views the Dalai Lama as a separatist and
a traitor, pulled out of a meeting this week at which
world powers were to discuss Iran in protest at the
U.S. plan to honor him.

China has also cancelled an annual human rights
dialogue with Germany to show is displeasure over
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's September meeting
with the Dalai Lama.

Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China had
expressed its "resolute opposition" to the award.

"China has solemnly demanded the United States cancel
the above-mentioned and extremely wrongful
arrangement," Yang told reporters on the sidelines of
the 17th Communist Party Congress.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said that if
the decision to honor the Dalai Lama was not reversed
it would have an "extremely serious impact" on
bilateral relations.

China had pulled out of the meeting on Iran for
"technical reasons", he told a news conference.

China's rhetoric against the Dalai Lama, whom Tibetan
Buddhists consider their spiritual leader, has been
increasing in line with his accolades abroad, even
though the government and the Dalai's envoys are
engaged in a tentative dialogue process.

OBSTACLES

Tibet officials said the dialogue was not going well.

"Although we have undergone a lot of contacts and
talks, the Dalai Lama has consistently supported
Tibetan independence," said Qiangba Puncog, Tibet's
governor.

"Under these circumstances, even though we keep the
doors for contact open, there cannot be major
development as long as the problem is not resolved."

The Dalai Lama has said he supports a "middle way"
policy that advocates autonomy for Tibet within China,
but Qiangba Puncog said China believed he still
supported independence and warmed that separatist
activities in the region were increasing.

"He (the Dalai Lama) should resolutely abandon his
Tibetan independence stance and activities," Qiangba
Puncog said. "But in my opinion, some of those
activities are actually escalating and setting a lot
of obstacles for further progress."

At least two Communist Party members in Tibet have
been expelled recently for alleged disloyalty to
China, according to an internal Party memo.

Earlier this year, an ethnic Tibetan in the western
province of Sichuan addressed a crowd on the need for
greater religious freedom and for the Dalai Lama to be
allowed to return. The man, Runggye Adak, has been
charged with subversion, a Hong Kong-based human
rights group has said.

Rights groups also say several Tibetan boys were
detained in the northwestern province of Gansu last
month after graffiti calling for the Dalai Lama's
return was found scribbled on walls, a sign of his
residual influence throughout ethnic Tibetan regions
of China.

Four of the boys, all 15, were still in detention.
Police had used electric prods on them and were
demanding payment for their release, Amnesty
International said in a statement.

Dear friends, I'm so happy to announce the publication of _The

bpNichol was one of Canada's most innovative, eclectic, entertaining,
and, yes, enigmatic poets, making startling interventions in the
development of poetry and profoundly influencing both his own and
subsequent generations of writers.

The Alphabet Game: A bpNichol Reader amasses key texts from the very
broad spectrum of Nichol's work, including both classic favourites and
more obscure treasures. From the early typewriter poetry of
Konfessions of an Elizabethan Fan Dancer and the life-long poem The
Martyrology to the heartbreaking prose of Journal and the whimsical
autobiography of Selected Organs, The Alphabet Game traces the
trajectory of this wildly imaginative and prolific poet.

This Nichol anthology is an ideal introduction for readers
encountering Nichol for the first time, and a much-needed compendium
for Nichol fans seeking access to works not readily available.

'His wit, along with the seriousness, was there to keep the language
free and untethered, to keep the poem aware of its roots, like a
tuxedo worn with bare feet in a muddy river =85 No other writer of our
time and place was so diverse, attempted so much, and never lost sight
of his intent.' =96 Michael Ondaatje

When I was a teenager I stole a copy of Howl from the library of the

I still have it.

I should mail it back to them.

in reference to may last post, I should add one fact: I didn't actually steal in the tens of thousands, but the books I did steal were probably worth 50 grand plus. I had my architecture period. Those are some pricey books. As for poetry, name it, I've stole it.
  I'm now mostly legit. I try to buy 1st editions, get the author's signature and sell. If I like the author, I'll have him sign at least two copies so I can keep one for myself. I've got signed first editions from  the poet laureate going back 2 decades. If the author is dead, a signed 1st is more valuable. The thought has occurred to me to set up an author hit list, you know, get real serious about "the business."

I've had 6 copies of Hakim Bey's Temporary Autonomous Zone stolen
from our community's library over the past 15 years.   Not poetry per

Frank Bidart has some very disturbing, powerful narrative poems full of hurting, hating, helping, loving, etc. The beats fulfill the praise and benediction part of the syllabus. Lord Byron's Don Juan would be an interesting poem to look at. Eliot, too. I'm still trying to come up with something for ritualized insult. I wish I knew more about Celtic poetry, or Arabic poetry. OF COURSE THE BIBLE, OLD tESTAMENT,  WOULD PROBABLY FULFILL THE CURSE, PRAISE AND JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT IN A COMPARITIVE POETRY COURSE.

Gabriel Gudding <gmguddi@ILSTU.EDU> wrote:  I wrote a course description for a mid-level undergraduate offering and
would like help, please, finding texts to live up to the catalog
description. Kin you help me? If you were going to teach this class,
what texts would you use:

"This is not a class in poetic forms. We will not be focusing on what a
sonnet is or how many lines are in a villanelle. We will instead read
poems that have incited revolutions, embarrassed nations, inspired
assassinations, that have helped found religious orders, and that have
become the backbone of various cultures throughout the history of
Indo-European letters. That is to say, we will explore poetry as a mode
of critical consciousness, as a means of cultural critique and symbolic
and social action. We will, in short, "get down" with what poetry is all
about: loving, hating, helping, hurting, destroying, and re-making the
world. Among other things, will look at poetry's roots not as a private,
nostalgic, cherished mode of utterance, but as a forceful and social
speech event, paying particular attention to poetry's origins in insult
and curse and praise. Much of the class will, on the one hand, explore
the poetry of ritualized insult, the poetry of invective, and, on the
other, the poetry of praise and benediction, the poetry of liturgies and
love making and spiritual epiphany. So, we will fundamentally approach
poetry (by both the reading of it and the writing of it) not as a
collection of aesthetic artifacts (called poems) that are to be
fetishized as a rarified form of precious speech uttered by special
beings (called poets), but as a socially ubiquitous, very serious, very
real, and often RILLY RILLY fun, means of making and re-making our
world--a kind of "world making" that all people do, from children to
popes to cops to students and professors."

help?

These last couple of posts remind me of Ron Padgett's memoir, where he describes lifting books with
Ted Berrigan. Very bohemian, subversive, and great fun. Except for the bookseller. And the author.
I'd go so far as to say that even the monstrous Barnes & Noble doesn't deserve to be stolen from, if
only for the effect it's bound to have on the minimum-wager at the cash register.

Many, many, back in the day when I was poor in NYC. Never from small
bookstores=8Bmany of which were owned by friends.

My best score was in my sophomore year when I knew for sure I was dropping
out of Swarthmore. I went into the bookstore and piled up the Cantos,
Personae, ABC of Reading, Dylan Thomas, cummings, Williams, Auden, oyce,
whatever was available, and put it all on my college bill. It came to over
two hundred dollars, which was a fortune in 1953. When I didn=B9t go back to
school my parents decided to disown me so they felt they shouldn=B9t have to
pay the bill. It remained unpaid for 30-plus years. I finally caught up wit=

it in the 1980s sometime. But in 1953, as soon as I had found my own place
and unpacked I read the Cantos cover to cover, skimming what I didn=B9t
understand. They changed my world. I still have that edition, which ends
with Canto 84.

Great news! They're stealing our books!

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The Frankfurt Book Fair has an indicator to
help publishers gauge public interest in the new offerings presented
at the annual exhibition -- the unofficial "most stolen book" index.

Bild am Sonntag and Germany's ZDF television have come up with lists
of titles most stolen from 15 leading German publishers' stands set
up in the Frankfurt trade fair grounds.

"The most-stolen books are usually the most-sold later on," Claudia
Hanssen of the Goldmann Verlag publishing house told Bild am Sonntag
newspaper, which published a list of the 10 most stolen German-
language books this year.

"They're the popular ones and are most likely to end up on the best-
seller lists," Hanssen added.

The German translation of Nobel Peace prizewinner Al Gore's "An
Inconvenient Truth," outlining the dangers of global warming,
featured among the mainly German titles on the list.

More than 100,000 people attended the book fair, which ended Sunday.
There were 7,448 exhibitions where publishers from 108 countries
presented some 400,000 different books, videos and other products.

I wrote a course description for a mid-level undergraduate offering and
would like help, please, finding texts to live up to the catalog
description. Kin you help me? If you were going to teach this class,
what texts would you use:

"This is not a class in poetic forms. We will not be focusing on what a
sonnet is or how many lines are in a villanelle. We will instead read
poems that have incited revolutions, embarrassed nations, inspired
assassinations, that have helped found religious orders, and that have
become the backbone of various cultures throughout the history of
Indo-European letters. That is to say, we will explore poetry as a mode
of critical consciousness, as a means of cultural critique and symbolic
and social action. We will, in short, "get down" with what poetry is all
about: loving, hating, helping, hurting, destroying, and re-making the
world. Among other things, will look at poetry's roots not as a private,
nostalgic, cherished mode of utterance, but as a forceful and social
speech event, paying particular attention to poetry's origins in insult
and curse and praise. Much of the class will, on the one hand, explore
the poetry of ritualized insult, the poetry of invective, and, on the
other, the poetry of praise and benediction, the poetry of liturgies and
love making and spiritual epiphany. So, we will fundamentally approach
poetry (by both the reading of it and the writing of it) not as a
collection of aesthetic artifacts (called poems) that are to be
fetishized as a rarified form of precious speech uttered by special
beings (called poets), but as a socially ubiquitous, very serious, very
real, and often RILLY RILLY fun, means of making and re-making our
world--a kind of "world making" that all people do, from children to
popes to cops to students and professors."

help?

I'm starting to feel pretty ethical compared to some on this list! As a teenager, I stole a number of New Directions paperbacks from the book section of Meyer Brothers department store in Paterson, NJ (although Paterson itself, the very first ND book I ever read, I either bought or borrowed from the library). But never since.

Even though I knew many who stole poetry books (late 1960s in San Francisco
&c), I never did. I remember at City Lights there was a sign above the
stairs going down to the poetry section then in the basement that read:
"Remember, it's your karma." That's not what stopped me. Nor did the fact
that the person at the register would not look at the customers closely,
even seeming to turn his or her back when one came from downstairs (making
it easy to steal books). Even though I was pretty poor, I think I loved the
poetry I read so much and was so grateful to publishers like Jargon and
stores like City Lights (which then had tables and comfortable chairs and
ashtrays in the basement) that I couldn't bring myself to do so.

(Signed books, to me, become more artifact than text, making them harder to
write in . With the signature I seem to lose some of the intimacy I might
have with the text and that is extremely important for me. I love how
Bernadette Mayer signed books during at least one period, with a gold stamp
pad and her thumbprint in gold, but I never asked her to sign one for me.)

in reference to may last post, I should add one fact: I didn't actually
steal in the tens of thousands, but the books I did steal were probably
worth 50 grand plus. I had my architecture period. Those are some pricey
books. As for poetry, name it, I've stole it.
  I'm now mostly legit. I try to buy 1st editions, get the author's
signature and sell. If I like the author, I'll have him sign at least two
copies so I can keep one for myself. I've got signed first editions from
the poet laureate going back 2 decades. If the author is dead, a signed 1st
is more valuable. The thought has occurred to me to set up an author hit
list, you know, get real serious about "the business."

  The found has always been my approach to everything.
    The only things i broke that code for were money and dope.  Between the
two, thousands and thousands and thousands  of dollars going to feed the
monkey's tapeworm.  Never enough of either money or dope to keep the man
inside satisfied.
    The only two books i stole it wasn't consciously done.
      The first stolen book was the Penguin bi-lingual Rimbaud, in a huge
bookstore somewhere in London.  My brother and I--aged 13 and 16 -- were
living in the trees and leaf piles in Hyde Park in September, so anything to
do to warm up, dry out the clothes a bit and relax was welcome.
       We'd hitched a ride from Dover to the City with a swinging young
couple who gave us each two  long bars of pure black hash, opiated.  The
whole time in England we were stoned.
         My brother was growing petulantly impatient with me reading for so
long. He wouldn't shut up. Finally I got up and followed him, cursing loudly
in dialect--straight out the door, passing the registers on the way.
Stopping at the street corner to light cigarettes, I found the book still in
my hand.
          My brother stared at me, shocked.  "I can't help it if it won't
let go of my hand," I said.
           He was very insulted--he thought i was using the book as a
comment on himself.
            Fortunately the light changed before we came to blows.
               The other time was very similar.  Back in Paris, we went to
American express to find out if there was any mail.  There were racks of new
American paperbacks, a shock to see after so long.  A profusely illustrated
paperback of the film of Bob Dylan, Don't Look Back, with all the dialogue
transcribed stared at me.  I was squatting by the racks with it when my
brother came over and said let's get out of here.  I shoved the book in my
pocket and took off after him.
             Outside he opened his hands. He had found well over a hundred
dollars by someone's feet and taken them.  The forgotten American paperback
found looking in the pocket for matches was an added bonus. Something to
read in the bug infested hotel.
             For once the the prodigious foreign spending of our country had
mysteriously smiled on two of its strays.

Second that about Baraka...of course his most recent charting in that  regard
(post WTC) many found extremely vexing...Eileen Myles (hell she even ran  for
President, she got my vote!) is the opposite of fear and is pretty much a
one person revolution....you have a lot of good stuff already I see by your
follow-up posts....i'm sure someone said Ginsberg a million years ago.....Anne
Waldman has some good curses and public purpose poems...i like the one where
she  tries to dry up the senate's genitals...was very unfortunate Comedy Central
 chose that unflattering angle to run that clip of her in a negative way a
few  years back...she is a beautiful woman....that irked....Babi Yar by
Yevtushenko  sort of riled the government in its day, didn't it...if you are going to
go  into ancient religious texts things like Inanna are a good source...the
Book of  the Dead....Catullus obviously....what about inflammatory poetry like
John  Brown's Body...a lot of this merges into song of  course....

  Call for Papers:


Society and Sensoria: Books at the Speed of the Senses



=93=85for the skin is faster than the word=94

=96Brian Massumi, Parables for the Virtual



The 10th Biennial Pyramid Atlantic Book Arts Fair and Conference

  November 2008, in the Washington DC area

The intent of this conference is to advance a critical language for =20
artists=92 books that emphasizes both sensory-based and social =20
perspectives. Considering our societal trajectory for electronic =20
communication, as well as the increasing speed through which we =20
correspond by electronic means, we see the field confronted with the =20
following questions: What is artistic communication, and what is its =20
place or role in society? Are the uses of slower, =93handmade,=94 or =20
historical processes, often involved in the production of books, an =20
emerging form of protest or a simple refusal of technological change? =20=

How are books resisting or embracing the rapidly paced exchange of =20
information?  What do the often slow, time-consuming methods =20
surrounding the production and reception of artists=92 books mean for =20=

an electronic society where the distribution and intensity of sensory =20=

stimuli appear to be shifting? How is the reception of artists=92 =20
books, and the literacy they promote, affected by a potential sensory =20=

shift into areas beyond the visual, in a society still dominated by =20
visual imagery?  Are artists=92 books a reaction against, or a =20
reinforcement of, what we might call an overly visualized society? =20
How does our sense of touch relate to the predominately visual =20
language of artists=92 books? What is our phenomenological =20
understanding of artists=92 books into a context of an expanded =
sensorium?

We are looking for papers and creative panels committed to rethinking =20=

artists=92 books as socially synthesized media devices with themes that =20=

foreground speed, touch and rhythm. We invite artists, writers, =20
critics, publishers, activists, students, and educators, to =20
articulate how we experience books under the particular conditions of =20=

handling, reading, and viewing, in a context of social =20
interconnection and difference.

We encourage presentations from, but not limited to, the following =20
areas: artists=92 books, visual and performing arts, visual and =20
cultural studies, visual anthropology, cognitive science, sociology, =20
analytic philosophy, comparative literature, literary theory, =20
linguistics, political science and activism.

The following are examples of potential topics.  Presenters, however, =20=

are in no way limited by them:



=B7      Speed of space and rhythm in books



=B7      Haptic interface and books



=B7      Phenomenology of artists=92 books



=B7      Embodiment and books



=B7      Devotion to craft as content



=B7      Time-consumption and memory



=B7      E-flux versus paper permanence



=B7      Techno culture as a site of confrontation with books



=B7      Synthesis of electronic information into non-electronic books



The conference runs in tandem with a biennial fair for well-known and =20=

emerging artists, publishers and dealers in the field of artists=92 =20
books.  We intend to create synergy between the fair and conference =20
by extending lines of communication between the various parties =20
involved in the fair and will make special effort to link books =20
exhibited in the fair to the conference presentations. We encourage =20
conference presenters to consider such a link as they develop their =20
papers.



Please send abstracts of no more than 500 words by JANUARY 15, 2008 to:



Tate Shaw and Ward Tietz



pyramidatlantic08@gmail.com



With your proposal, please include a current CV.



The conference will provide a modest honorarium, though we strongly =20
encourage participants to apply for funding in their home regions and/=20=

or through institutions with which they are affiliated. Please do not =20=

hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Space both, not both, streets, noise


Begin with an origin O = (01,02,03,...0N), coordinates in dim N Euclidean
space; each sector has an N-1 flat w/ total of 2^N; consider these open
sets separated by N-2 flats... bounded by... Each N-1 flat coheres intern-
ally; the O is isolated - there are rumors of O... unreachable, a kind of
central core, mythos, radio radio. The space is T0,1,2 not T3,4,5; no open
set contains O, let's define it that way. O is countable, phenomenologic-
ally O is unaccountable - now think numerous points on the N-2 separating
flats - give these rational coordinates, finite number of them - they're
wanderers among the riches of the world, peer over barriers, simply
unreachable - organisms live and talk within the open set - they're no
boundaries as far as they know - only rumors - not of boundaries but of
those numerous points - call them {X} - {X} forms a set - the set sits on
orthogonal roads of sorts, easy communication among themselves through the
origin O - they don't see anything though - maybe they're the grit of the
world,* the fasteners - maybe they guard the potential well of the open
sets - open sets are far too fragile here - there's something lacking with
them - a certain hardness, inertness - but {X} makes up for that...

* Something should be added here concerning the dim-3 space of SL, the
projection from 3D -> 2D, the visual representation of time (trails), the
closed (bounded) spaces that are open (unbounded, asymptotic) spaces from
the viewpoint of the avatar (hence the 'cycling' as one tries to leave the
game-space). And that there might be points, point-sets outside the game-
space, inaccessible, nonetheless, metaphorically, viewpoints into game
communication, forbidden areas, points like telephones or bugs, holes in
and out of other dimensions.

This weekend in Chicago:

Opera Cabal presents
DELUSIONS: A Festival of New Opera, Music, Dance and Theater
at the Zhou B Art Center, First Floor Gallery
1029 W 35th St.
full information and schedule at http://operacabal.blogspot.com

Among the performers will be the Nonsense Company, presenting
"Great Hymn of Thanksgiving" (for three virtuoso speaker-percussionists
around a dinner table setup, with texts from Iraq war news reporting,
invented folktales, the Army prayer manual, and the poetry of Rae
Armantrout) and "Conversation Storm" (a formally strange play
dissecting recent U.S. policies on torture while turning the effects
of torture back on the categories of time, place, and character),
a pairing which recently won the "Best New Play" award at the
San Francisco Fringe Festival.

There's plenty of time to see and hear fantastic new performances
while sandwiching in the City Visible reading as well!

Hope to see you there.

all the best,

WHAT'S IN STORE: Poems 2000-2007
A new collection by Trevor Joyce
co-published by The Gig & New Writers' Press

_What's in Store_ is Trevor Joyce's first full-length book since the
publication of his collected poems, _with the first dream of fire they hunt
the cold_ (2001). For this volume, the author has shaped eight years' worth
of work -- individual poems, extended sequences, translations from the
Irish, Chinese and other languages -- into a continuous booklength
structure. These poems find Joyce reaching out towards a jarringly wide
range of styles and voices, from the tart lyricism of his workings of
European folksongs to the ferociously dense collage/inscription of
"STILLSMAN." Brought together as a book, the poems take on further meanings:
_What's in Store_ is at once a Borgesian guide to the history, customs and
scientific discourse of an unknown country, and an Oulipian textual machine,
whose workings by turns terrify and exalt.

"This is one of my favorite poets anywhere. His poems have the clear,
austere and impersonal ring of great translations. They are archetypal, they
are strange." --Fanny Howe

A cover shot & a selection of poems from the book may be found at
http://www.ndorward.com/poetry/books/joyce_whatsinstore.htm

*

Trevor Joyce was born in 1947 in Dublin, Ireland. With the poet Michael
Smith, he co-founded New Writers' Press and the poetry magazine _The Lace
Curtain_, key channels for modernist and avant-garde writing in Ireland in
the 1960s and 1970s. His publications include _The Poems of Sweeny
Peregrine_ (NWP, 1976), a version of the Irish _Buile Suibhne_; _stone
floods_ (NWP, 1995); _Syzygy_ (Wild Honey, 1998); and _with the first dream
of fire they hunt the cold: A Body of Work 1966-2000_ (NWP/Shearsman, 2001).
He has lived in Cork since 1984.

 COMMENTS ON TEXT LOSES TIME:

=20

 "Part nested Minimalist cubes and part laser light that won't diverge =
across distance, Nico Vassilakis' poetry seems to ask whether we are =
primates at play on a baseball diamond of memory and desire beside =
mural-lined public structures slipping toward infinite regression.

=20

Richly iterative, these pairings and alphabets escape the mirror to =
thrill us with variation and sting all forms of complacency. Vassilakis =
extends Oulipian strategies:  Perec references, lamellisections, =
crystalline build-outs and transpositions, a scat of nonrepresentational =
vocables, lettered whirlwinds giving speed for legibility, --  =
"extracting the gem through layers of gauze" and, other times, lowering =
a gem into a fold.

=20

Can an argument between a machine that produces texts and "longhand into =
tiny notebooks" wake us up?  In pain, "the throbbing thumb" makes us =
"attend to the living."

=20

If Vassilakis revises the rock lyric "meet-the-new-boss, =
same-as-the-old-boss" to "meet the solipsistic era.  same as the old =
solipsistic era,"  is treatment to be had in a bar, a science lab, or =
will it reach us over the radio?  Try a road trip, so "you can't afford =
to blink, to be blind for even a second" going through a colander out =
where dust is breeding and "glass traps lighting" like no scene you've =
seen in quite this way. Through crevices, perforations, punctures, =
piercings, pinholes, see neighborhoods as "that place where organized =
sleeping happens." So, look for a faceted colony that "sometimes =
congeals.""

=20

--Deborah Meadows

=20

"Nico Vassilakis' Text Loses Time unhinges the folds of the book and the =
word; as the 'folded loose leafed sheets whiz past your ears' you can =
hear the echoes of meaning. The words flake off the page like aged paint =
leaving a patina of colour and meaning on the surface and a growing heap =
of signification at our feet. Here the means of writing rise up and turn =
against our expectation, lurching into new spaces. Letters become =
tactile, meaning becomes rubbery, and both reading and writing become a =
new collaboration."

 The Rhymes of Vellum
=20

A boy or girl, Vellum, blows a few papers in the wind   It answers noise =
  Hopping, hopped. Tapping, tapped   Swim sweet twins swing twig   Think =
of losing, serendipity or the wings of a sentence   He will get them, =
but not tell you where they were   I like to drink through my brother's =
center   A finger's rose begins   A shadow grows down the sidewalk   =
Clapping, clapped   It helps to rip this box open   Sound harbor, sound =
hole   Blind rose is a very shape friend   I want a shirt to visit my =
slacks   Moon noose soon loose   A good look at the cookbook - lots of =
o's - ghost epaulets on the shoulders of a paragraph   Dishes mixes, =
buses guesses   I sit down to work; I draw with my right hand   The =
response sadly is never   Living as wide as it gets   Think sift   You =
could fault the long moth, the dog lost in soft fog, but it's the song's =
cost, its crust   I got frogs in my throat, a forehead throat   Boris =
said, "Your throat's red."   Timothy hums a nail into the wood   I run =
uphill swimming   The test isn't over   The floor's hard   The new girl =
at school   Can you look at a book without getting caught on a line?   =
Like radio, writing is a broadcast   They found people in the mailbox   =
A huge gem in a cage   Susan flips back to the glossary   Only a certain =
type of fastener   The letter "R" in each corner of a page   =
Unexpectedly the middle is empty   Next, write your best trick   Most =
banjo   Odd pretty piece asleep   A drum whisking discard into cream   =
In this way we raise our pigs on fire & Kenny is always six yards old   =
The donkey said, "Enough." The donkey said, "English."   Dark thoughts =
won't cure light sickness   The ladder moved slightly throws the world =
in disarray   The teacher's a bird and flies out the window   They had =
found their clown center   Art will say, "I like to pitch. What is your =
name?" Art will say, "Hi, I'm Art. I like to pitch. What's your name?"   =
Slowly toward a large bird   Paper hats, cats   A lot of noise comes to =
visit Long thin water in a line of people   I called you once today to =
say geese make a village of gold & both of my little friends like to =
sing. Their secret voices are beautiful   Spray Spray Spray

AUTHOR'S STATEMENT:

=20

This book intends to present both verbal and visual poetries as equal. =
Though notions of poetics have shifted and swerved, what has stayed =
solid throughout is that the alphabet, the word - however arranged - =
contains, within it, dual significance. First, the proto-historic role =
of the visual conveyance of represented fact. Second, the overriding =
desire of human utterance to substantiate existence. In conjoining these =
two models this book hopes to form a third, blurred value. Thought and =
experience are factors that accrue, while staring and writing help =
resolve and conclude. Text itself is an amalgam of units of meaning. As =
you stare at text you notice the visual aspects of letters. As one =
stares further, meaning loses its hierarchy and words discorporate and =
the alphabet itself begins to surface. Shapes, spatial relations and =
visual associations emerge as one delves further. Alphabetic bits or =
parts or snippets of letters can create an added visual vocabulary =
amidst the very text one is reading. One aim, to this end, is to merge =
and hinge visual and textual writing into workable forms. This book =
collects some of these experiments.

Begin with an origin O = (01,02,03,...0N), coordinates in dim N Euclidean
space; each sector has an N flat w/ total of 2^N; consider these open
sets separated by N-1 flats... bounded by... Each N flat coheres intern-

central core, mythos, radio radio. The space is T0,1,2 not T3,4,5; no open

THE 2ND ANNUAL CHICAGO CALLING ARTS FESTIVAL

EVENT:
During the 2nd Annual Chicago Calling Arts Festival, Chicago-based artists
will showcase performances and projects that involve collaborations with
artists living in other locations—here in the U.S. and in other countries
worldwide. The collaborations between Chicago-based artists and those living
elsewhere will be prepared, improvised, or a combination of both. For
instance, a Chicago-based poet will be collaborating with a visual artist
from Virginia, a Chicago-based ensemble will be collaborating with a
musician from New York, and so on. Some of the performances will involve
live feeds between Chicago and elsewhere.

Artists involved with Chicago Calling work in a range of media, including
music, painting, photography, poetry, dance, and so on. The festival’s
participants will include Lance Adams, Christopher Alexander, Rheim Alkadhi,
Karla Amour, Heidi Arnold, Alpha Bruton, Jerome Bryerton, Orin Buck,
Vittorio Carli, Asimina Chremos, Craig Christie, Janina Ciezadlo, Larry O.

Dear members,

On Monday, October 22nd, Rachel Zolf (Human Resources) and Matt=20
Henriksen (Is Holy) read at New York's Poetry Project at St. Marks=20
Church.

Rachel Zolf=92s newest collection of poetry, Human Resources, was=20
released in spring 2007 by Coach House Books. Her previous collections=20=

are Masque, which was shortlisted for the 2005 Trillium Book Award for=20=

Poetry, and Her absence, this wanderer. Zolf lives in Toronto and was=20
the founding poetry editor of The Walrus magazine.

Here are just some of the reviews of Human Resources:

something=20
new about guts, and about how dictions slip across one another,=20
entwining, shimmering, wisecracking. For Zolf, political invention=20

'It's a language experiment, a bit of office thievery, a sleight of=20
hand, and gorgeously executed. I have had the pleasure of hearing Zolf=20=

read--certainly one of the finest readings I witnessed over the course=20=

Just outside of Hong Kong, I managed to buy the
complete series of the original Star Trek. Now, and
please be somewhat kind, the collection costs about
$150 Stateside (and I regard this series as part of my
cultural heritage), but anyway, I was able to buy it
in China - top quality - for about $3 (or 21 yuan).

Sigh!

You could order a textbook that *does* devote a fair
amount of space to the formal analysis of poetry, and
ask the students to rip out the offending pages...

Sorry to reference one of the worst movies ever made,
but that's what I'm reminded of

Tho this is mostly a zine show, they get fairly good traffic & there
was a number of other literary presses there last year.  Best part
was the circuit bending table where they showed people how to take
their old musical toys & keyboards & cross the circuits to make
really groovy new instruments.

his working of the middle-Irish Buile Suibhne, and stone floods (1995),
which was nominated for the Irish Times Literature Prize for Poetry. His
most recent publications are with the first dream of fire they hunt the
cold: A Body of Work 1966-2000 (NWP & Shearsman Books, 2001), the audio CD
Red Noise of Bones (Coelocanth & Wild Honey Press, 2001), and, launching at
Test, What's In Store: Poems 2000-2007 (The Gig/NWP, 2007). He has also
published several papers on contemporary poetics, and has lectured and given
public readings of his work throughout Ireland, the U.K. and the U.S.A.
Joyce is a founder and director of SoundEye: The Cork International Poetry
Festival and was a Fulbright Scholar for the year 2002-2003. In 2004 he was
elected a member of Aosdána, the Irish Affiliation of Artists, and was the
first writer to be awarded a fellowship by the Ballinglen Arts Foundation.


Founded in 2004 and consisting of three prominent Ottawa-area artists, John
Lavery, Max Middle and Jason Sonier, the MAX MIDDLE SOUND PROJECT is an
interdisciplinary collaboration committed to the integration of poetry,
sound poetry and music, incorporating elements of theatre and performance
art as ancillary expression. The ensemble has performed in the Ottawa Fringe
Festival, the Ottawa International Writers Festival and in the Dusty Owl,
Tree and Grey Borders reading series.

Bios

Trevor Joyce was born in 1947 in Dublin, Ireland. With the poet Michael
Smith, he co-founded New Writers' Press and the poetry magazine _The Lace
Curtain_, key channels for modernist and avant-garde writing in Ireland in
the 1960s and 1970s. His publications include _The Poems of Sweeny
Peregrine_ (NWP, 1976), a version of the Irish _Buile Suibhne_; _stone
floods_ (NWP, 1995); _Syzygy_ (Wild Honey, 1998); and _with the first dream
of fire they hunt the cold: A Body of Work 1966-2000_ (NWP/Shearsman, 2001)=
.
He has lived in Cork since 1984.

Mair=E9ad Byrne's previous publications include two poetry collections, *SO=
S
Poetry* (/ubu Editions 2007), and *Nelson & The Huruburu Bird* (Wild Honey
Press 2003); three chapbooks, *An Educated Heart* (Palm Press 2005),
*Vivas*(Wild Honey Press 2005), and
*Kalends* (Belladonna* 2005). She is an Associate Professor of English at
Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. With Ian Davidson, she is the
co-manager of the listserv British & Irish Poets. Before immigrating to the
United States in 1994, she was a journalist, playwright, arts centre
director, and teacher in Ireland.

Hoping that plenty of you can make it out to Trevor's readings, and
especially his gig with Mair=E9ad in Providence.

Ron Silliman will be reading and discussing his and others? poetry as part =

of the Transparency Machine Event Series, in the Ambassador Lounge, Salon=20
C, 2nd Floor, C.A.W. Student Centre, University of Windsor, Windsor,=20
Thursday 25th October, 7:30-9:00 PM. All welcome to this free public=20
event.=20

Silliman?s selection of texts and images, for his discussion that is=20
titled ?Recognizability,? are now available for download from News&Events=20
at <http://web4.uwindsor.ca/english>.=20

Ron Silliman is author of over twenty-five poetry books, including the=20
completed 800+ page poem, The Alphabet, begun in 1979, and, just released, =

The Age of Huts (compleat). Silliman has contributed massively and=20
uniquely, through a community of writers sometimes called the Language=20
School, to our understanding of how poetry articulates the contemporary=20
social world. He has written essays in poetics that have been, like his=20
poetry, widely influential. Silliman is renowned for a juxtapositional=20
method of writing he has termed "the new sentence," which takes Ezra=20
Pound's "ideogrammic" method in profoundly democratic directions. Silliman =

is famed as a skillful editor (notably of the anthology In the American=20
Tree) and is today arguably the most influential poetry blogger in English =

(his site of lively opinion and news, Silliman's Blog, <
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com> has received over 1,000,000 hits since=20
its August 2002 start). He currently lives in Philadelphia and works in=20
the computer industry, and has previously lived and worked in the San=20
Francisco area as a prison and tenant organizer, lobbyist, teacher,=20
college administrator, and editor of Socialist Review.=20

The Transparency Machine Event Series invites a poet to talk about his or=20
her work in the context of other texts selected by the poet. The series=20
provides a forum (with overhead projector!) for discussing the practice=20
and theory of writing and reading poetry -- including practices and=20
theories of prefixing poetry ("anti-"; "non-"), adjectivizing poetry=20
("poetic"), and capitalizing poetry (first letter; letters at random).=20
Poetry prismatically refracts social, political, scientific, aesthetic=20
languages, transforming them into something exciting and strange. How does =

poetic form do that? This series explores questions about the language of=20
poetry, offering readers and writers a multi-dimensional experience of the =

shapes and sounds of the contemporary moment by inviting leading and=20
emerging innovative practitioners of the poetry art.=20

Silliman's Transparency Machine Event is co-sponsored by the Department of =

English Language, Literature, and Creative Writing at the University of=20
Windsor, and the Department of English at Wayne State University. For=20
further information, please contact lcabri@uwindsor.ca.=20

Special Note: Ron Silliman will also be giving a free public=20
reading/performance with poet Tracie Morris on Friday, 26 October,=20
3:00-5:00 PM, in the Welcome Center Auditorium (Warren and Woodward=20
Avenues), Wayne State University, Detroit.=20

"Islamo-Facism Awareness Week" --straight out of the daily  Two Minutes of
Hate in Orwell's 1984

A Who's Who of the Neo-Con Brigades

Also on the agenda, not mentioned here, is an all out assault on Global
Warming

*Dear David,*
*    *

*Take Action: Speak Out Against "Islamo-Facism Awareness Week"

During the week of October 22-26, 2007, right-wing and neo-conservative
political forces led by the David Horowitz Freedom Center are calling for
"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week" events on campuses across the U.S. (for a
list of campuses and speakers, see below).

If this event is coming to your campus or neighborhood - and even if it's
not - speak out against this racist assault on Muslims, Arabs,
Arab-Americans, South Asians and anyone viewed as sympathetic towards those
communities. While some people might dismiss the neo-conservatives as fringe
elements who don't impact on U.S. policy, the truth is much more disturbing.
They are part of an alliance of forces that work to maintain the war against
Iraq, escalate the standoff with Iran into military conflict, and cement
Israel's hold on the occupied Palestinian territories and violations of
Palestinian human rights through a system of apartheid rule.

The stakes are simply too high to ignore, and we should respond to the
so-called "Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week" - and to all such provocations -
pro-actively, not defensively.

To find out what action you can take on your campus and in your community
and to read about what others are doing, click
here<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=lGRZLqK0RKuWIROfHP7JJuSoYVT39OYC>.
 To learn more about the forces driving this agenda, read "Understanding Why
Islamophobia is on the
Rise<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=O3da05Xcst7MyL8JT3hjBPqeYU0djbjz>,"
the analysis by Phyllis Bennis, fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies,
and member of the U.S. Campaign's steering committee.

By defending basic freedoms of thought, speech and belief, we underscore
three simple messages:

We stand for free speech, not hate speech.

We stand for tolerance, not bigotry.

We stand for education, not demagoguery.

SPEAK OUT FOR FREE SPEECH, TOLERANCE, AND EDUCATION!

I was blogging about a particular poem that struck me for the way it
simultaneously plays between the levels...i.e. the idea of poetry addressed  TO
children and at the same time seeing childhood from a distance...I was  wondering
if anybody knew of any other poems where the author is writing it to a  child,
but the poem is designed to be read in dual (or multifarious)  ways....that
is, the poem holds a certain charm for a child, but as the child  grows he or
she will most likely read it as a vastly more mature poem...I think  the Palmer
poem from Notes for Echo Lake is a classic example of this...but I  was trying
to think of others and I could remember reading such poems but could  not
pinpoint particular authors/poems....any suggestions?


the following is from today's...

_http://www.joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/_
(http://www.joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/)

the poem by Elias appears there...





I was reading around in Meddles into Preclusion, Che Elias's  book, and was
really drawn into this particular multipartite poem. I've always  loved poems
that ostensibly are written for children, especially when they are  darkly
freighted with adult fears, trauma and gravity--disguised lest the images  hit
childhood with full-force. It's almost a genre that's never been recognized.
Michael Palmer had some very wonderful poems that would fall in this category
(I'm thinking of poems like "Song of the Round Man" from Notes for Echo  Lake
which is dedicated "for Sarah when she's older.") "I am sad today said  the
sad-eyed man/ for I have locked my head in a Japanese box // and lost the  key."
There are ways of telling children things about the world, and there are  ways
to soften the blows. Isn't that the raison d'etre of fairy tales?  I find
poems of this sort (which are themselves rather like wise beings, wise  guides in
fairy tales, waiting to assist the dreamer/reader through the years)  among
the most touching poems, often. Elias doesn't explicitly state this is a  poem
of this sort, but it's how it struck me. Several of the sections are titled
with names, perhaps of people (children?) they are addressed to, perhaps to let
us know that they are portraits. Here are some excerpts that I think scramble
 the linguistic DNA of fairy tales very nicely. They seem to possess the key
to  magic language that children are usually given by the grace of birth, but
which  they somehow lose over the years...

Hallo all!

I'm posting a call for submissions for a new radio show I'm going to be
producing on a local station in Prescott, AZ called
Coyote Radio.  The show will be called The Janitor's Closet and will be up
and running sometime in November.  Is a tangential growth spurt off of my
reading series that has struggled to gain an audience for a year and a
half.  My series was called "in the footsteps of language" and while I got
awesome writers and performers to come, most of the time it was a really
small audience.  So instead of trying to have people come here,  I'm going
to go the radio route-- which is better because the show will be available
on Podcast.  soooooo.. heres what I am looking for:

experimental recordings of poetry, noise, sound, fluxus recordings,
experimental music.... anything along those lines..

forward this on to any listserv or person that you think might be
interested!


Mp3s can be sent to egvajda [at] gmail [dot] com

or cds can be sent to :

grace vajda
147 n. alarcon st.
prescott, az 86301 USA

thanks for your continued generosity!

William,

There are some by Thomas McGrath to his son Tomasito.

There is Ben Jonson's "On My First Son" which is addressed directly to
his deceased son. His "On My First Daughter" is however not an apostrophe.

My next book, Rhode Island Notebook, out in November, is a 400+ pg poem
addressed to my daughter Clio -- but the dedication to her at the front
of the book indicates that it's to be read by her only when she is much
older.

Gabriel

here's ben

Farewell, thou child of my right hand, and joy ;
     My sin was too much hope of thee, lov'd boy.
Seven years thou wert lent to me, and I thee pay,
     Exacted by thy fate, on the just day.
Oh, could I lose all father now ! For why
     Will man lament the state he should envy?
To have so soon 'scaped world's and flesh's rage,
     And if no other misery, yet age !
Rest in soft peace, and, asked, say, Here doth lie
     Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry.
For whose sake henceforth all his vows be such
     As what he loves may never like too much.

When I dropped out of college in '96 (before returning some seven years later), I took with me, from the university library, the Tuumba edition of Bob Perelman's "AKA" and Gertrude Stein's "Bee Time Vine." I felt that I deserved them (since the university was trying to bill me for a semester of classes I didn't take, after making it practically impossible to withdraw in time to avoid that billing), and also that I was "rescuing" them, since no-one had checked either of them out in over a decade. I felt pretty bad about it pretty soon, but I never returned them. Now there might be people there who would actually read 'em.

I had a friend who took Perelman's "Braille" from mIKEAL's community library, that same year, I think. I can't say who, and don't know whether they still have it. I read it, though.

If II remember correctly, Robert Pinsky's "An Explanation of America" uses this device.

the following is from today's...

_http://www.joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/_
(http://www.joebrainardspyjamas.blogspot.com/)

the poem by Elias appears there...





I was reading around in Meddles into Preclusion, Che Elias's book, and was
really drawn into this particular multipartite poem. I've always loved poems
that ostensibly are written for children, especially when they are darkly
freighted with adult fears, trauma and gravity--disguised lest the images hit
childhood with full-force. It's almost a genre that's never been recognized.
Michael Palmer had some very wonderful poems that would fall in this category
(I'm thinking of poems like "Song of the Round Man" from Notes for Echo Lake
which is dedicated "for Sarah when she's older.") "I am sad today said the
sad-eyed man/ for I have locked my head in a Japanese box // and lost the key."
There are ways of telling children things about the world, and there are ways
to soften the blows. Isn't that the raison d'etre of fairy tales? I find
poems of this sort (which are themselves rather like wise beings, wise guides in
fairy tales, waiting to assist the dreamer/reader through the years) among
the most touching poems, often. Elias doesn't explicitly state this is a poem
of this sort, but it's how it struck me. Several of the sections are titled
with names, perhaps of people (children?) they are addressed to, perhaps to let
us know that they are portraits. Here are some excerpts that I think scramble
the linguistic DNA of fairy tales very nicely. They seem to possess the key
to magic language that children are usually given by the grace of birth, but
which they somehow lose over the years...

Pierre, You rat! (that's not a flame, it's just that I was Assistant
Manager of the Eighth St. Bookshop then.) I'm glad I didn't have to
catch you. It wasn't the people who would actually read a book that
bothered me so much, it was the junkies & professional thieves, sent
in with a shopping list from small fence bookshops. They'd take big
pricey art books, or series like the Bollingen Complete Works of Carl
Jung, a volume or two at a time, on order. As the job gradually
changed from talking about books to policing thieves, I decided to
head for the territories. Sylvester

I got 41* and then stuck with a John M. Bennett poem:


    1. hew means:
    2. roast
    3. chop
    4. mean
    5. amuse

Life lessons

(A rhyme for my god-daughters)

The wagtail builds a cup of mud,=20
defends it with his life.
His wings like swordstrokes draw the hawk,
he'll never take a wife.

The spider spins her broody sac,
the killing day is ceased.
Hanging in the sun to harden,
it makes the magpie's feast.

The duck will raise the orphan hens,
believe them all her daughter.
She leads them to the loveless dam,
drowns them in the water.

David Horowitz is a thoughtful version of Ann Coulter, really bad and potentially dangerous.

*Take Action: Speak Out Against "Islamo-Facism Awareness Week"

During the week of October 22-26, 2007, right-wing and neo-conservative
political forces led by the David Horowitz Freedom Center are calling for
"Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week" events on campuses across the U.S. (for a
list of campuses and speakers, see below).

If this event is coming to your campus or neighborhood - and even if it's
not - speak out against this racist assault on Muslims, Arabs,
Arab-Americans, South Asians and anyone viewed as sympathetic towards those
communities. While some people might dismiss the neo-conservatives as fringe
elements who don't impact on U.S. policy, the truth is much more disturbing.
They are part of an alliance of forces that work to maintain the war against
Iraq, escalate the standoff with Iran into military conflict, and cement
Israel's hold on the occupied Palestinian territories and violations of
Palestinian human rights through a system of apartheid rule.

The stakes are simply too high to ignore, and we should respond to the
so-called "Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week" - and to all such provocations -
pro-actively, not defensively.

To find out what action you can take on your campus and in your community
and to read about what others are doing, click
here.
 To learn more about the forces driving this agenda, read "Understanding Why
Islamophobia is on the
Rise,"
the analysis by Phyllis Bennis, fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies,
and member of the U.S. Campaign's steering committee.

By defending basic freedoms of thought, speech and belief, we underscore
three simple messages:

We stand for free speech, not hate speech.

We stand for tolerance, not bigotry.

We stand for education, not demagoguery.

SPEAK OUT FOR FREE SPEECH, TOLERANCE, AND EDUCATION!

-Your voice does not belong to another.

For a fraction of what each of us contribute to
"far-off wars," of what is spent in the evening on web
searches and e-mails, less than the cost of home
delivery and the gasoline that entails, and more
effective than most city-wide protest...

"This is the voice of the Global Corporation. You are now being
admitted into the labour camp where you will spend the rest of your
days. You will suffer what you will suffer, without recourse, without
mercy. You are a criminal of the state. And you will pay the ultimate
penalty for your acts of subversion. Perpare yourselves for the
sentence you have been awaiting. It is beginning now--everything is
nothing, and nothing is everything. You will be assigned the following
GC identification numbers. You do not need to memorize them. The GC is
memorizing you. You will never be free again--"

 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
 are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
 myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their
 incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in
 paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic
 temporalities.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding
the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to operate a
decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present
of the Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

		   [ see http://www.eskimo.com/~bbrace/netcom/books.txt ]

KEYWORDS:

>> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...


        Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

~ This interminable, relentless (online) sequence of imagery began in
earnest on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been
over twenty-five years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for many years` worth of
12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour image
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at
topica.com /subscribe 12hr-isbn-jpeg

 --
 	 The image was to make nothing visible but their connection with
 	 one another by space and air, yet each surrounded by the unique
 	 aura that disengages every deeply seen image from the world of
 	 irrelevant relationships and calls forth a tremor of
 	 astonishment at its fateful necessity. Thus from artworks of
 	 dead masters, over-life-size strangeness whose names we do not
 	 know and do not wish to know, look out at us enigmatically as
 	 symbols of all being.

 --

 Big Grey Bricks: This project also serves as a rehearsal for its
 culmination as a series of offset-printed volumes: each 800+ full-bleed
 pages (5x8"_300lpi), where the full integrated rhythm of
 greyscale-sequence can be more intricately resolved. I'd provide all
 design, prepress and production.

 --
This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones
or extended-black quadtones. Other supporters receive rare copies of the
first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for
12hr-email-subscriptions, can also be made at
http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/buy-into.html, or by mailed cheque/check:
$5/mo $50/yr. Art-institutions must pay for any images retained longer
than 12 hours.

I don't know if folks - including myself - are asleep at the wheel here (what's left of the wheel), but I woke up this morning with the thought that if - as it appears they are willing to do - the Senate confirms the Bush's nomination for Attorney General - 'we' will have condoned the nominee's stated position (yesterday) that the President (as Commander and Chief) has the (continued) authority to continue to use Torture (and, thus, be above the Law and not abide the Geneva conventions).

 Personally I think it is time to - and I will - make those calls to members of the Committee. Once the Senate makes this vote - and consequently publicly sanctions Bush and Cheney's right to administer torture - I am willing suspect that such a vote means that Torture is (ipso facto)  the  Law of the  Land.

 Nothing like living under a Coup (aka Presidential Power)  aided and abetted by a spineless Congress - as so it seems, I suspect, to more than a few of us.

 Calling now,

Sylvester,

I never stole a book from the Eight Street Bookshop, but, while living in
Connecticut, I visited it whenever I went to Manhattan from 1961-73. It
played a major role in my literary education. I still miss the place,
especially the basement.

Pierre, You rat! (that's not a flame, it's just that I was Assistant
Manager of the Eighth St. Bookshop then.) I'm glad I didn't have to
catch you. It wasn't the people who would actually read a book that
bothered me so much, it was the junkies & professional thieves, sent
in with a shopping list from small fence bookshops. They'd take big
pricey art books, or series like the Bollingen Complete Works of Carl
Jung, a volume or two at a time, on order. As the job gradually
changed from talking about books to policing thieves, I decided to
head for the territories. Sylvester

Unless I am blind to the mention, Barry, I do not see any mention of the (new?) MIT of Picabia's writings. Saw it on the Black Oak table this past weekend. Includes a smattering of his graphic work. A well done book on first blush (rush).

 In any case, nice article - congrats.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"

Call for essays on event and sound - on the temporal dimension - in
poetry, for a special international issue of ESC: English Studies in
Canada.

We welcome critical writing on poetry broadly conceived of as an event in
sound and time, ramifying through the social, language, technology,
history. We encourage contributions that extend recent work on questions
of orality, oratures, aurality, voice, performance, close listening,
spoken word, phonotext, live events, audio recording, etc., to questions
of temporality and the event.

We invite contributors to design their essays around the inclusion of
recorded material as this special issue will feature an accompanying cd.
We therefore encourage contributors to provide recorded material and to
refer to it - and when appropriate to design contributions around this cd
opportunity.

We ask that essays be no less than 1 250 and no more than 4 000 words and
that we receive them no later than 1 February 2008. Please contact us
regarding any questions you may have.

I too feel like I grew up in the Eighth Street Bookshop, also in the one across the street from it, a discount place  called Marlborough Books, if I remember correctly.  A large part of my literary education as a teenager came about in these two places.  I acquired books by Robert Duncan, H.D., Frank O'Hara, the Beats, and many others, some of which I still have and refer to.  I don't think I ever stole a book from either of these places, although I might have.  Stealing a book always seemed like potentially bad karma if you wanted to live to see your own work published (I was writing poems back then as well) so I don't think I ever did purloin anything.  Regards, Tom Savage

Pierre, You rat! (that's not a flame, it's just that I was Assistant

bothered me so much, it was the junkies & professional thieves, sent
in with a shopping list from small fence bookshops. They'd take big
pricey art books, or series like the Bollingen Complete Works of Carl
Jung, a volume or two at a time, on order. As the job gradually
changed from talking about books to policing thieves, I decided to

 Some new pieces. As always, appreciate your feedback. Amazing, by the way, with a link from Ron Silliman's blog, and attention here,  the note on the late Laura Ulewicz drew over 400 visitors!  More readers than she had in a long, long time.  Yes,working on altering obscurity into printed light.

 Days of the Dead - Valencia Street (San Francisco)

 October and the dead come close, real close. The couple - in their Sunday best - used to live at the top of the hill on Liberty near Sanchez Street. Back down here on Valencia, they are happy to glad hand and give a smile to everyone...

 Haptics in Bilbao:

 ...A Haptic: a pulse, a register, a music, the soft-architecture turned to marks (blue, black). The script in advance of script. To pray with ones hands and fingers. To not, never - well, now and then - stop.

 Days of the Dead - Red Ghosts at Work  Red Ghosts? Maybe it’s the change of season, the cast of shadows, a dark that comes earlier and earlier, but suddenly the neighborhood is sporadically full of red troops crossing the sidewalk!,,,

 A good weekend to you, and do what we can to stop giving consent to those who presume to represent us and continue to condone and perpetuate torture. Bad for the economy, and way bad for the soul.Stephen Vincent

Among the readings at my wedding was Wallace Stevens' "Restatement of Romance".

  There was also a Yiddish poem by an early 20th century woman poet, I think from one of Irving Howe's anthologies, but I'm ashamed to say I can't remember the title or the author's name.

My wife and I are both rather fond of Gregory Corso's "Marriage" and considered reading it at our wedding many years ago.  The poem had me early with its "werewolf bathtubs" line; it's probably not for everyone.

Thinking of Corso's marriage poem, Ginsberg read a poem about abortion in a
Bar Mitzvah.

of worldings and wordings, edges of workings, avatartist are the tain of
the mirror, the mirror themselves, reflections themselves, reflections of
reflections which are avatartist reflecting.

avatartist want you knowing these, them, avatartist want you knowing we,
they, you, gatherings, filterings, are all avatartist, yes they are are,
no they are-not are-not, avatartist want you knowing there is no knowing,
they are no magic-tricking.

"if i announce the truth, it is not in the mind. [...] the true world
presents itself to the five vijnanas. there is no gradation when one is in
a state of collectedness, collecting, aggregating, filtering. take a
painting-master or hir pupils, who arrange colors to make a picture - i
teach the picture is not in the colors or canvas or plate - in order to
make it attractive to all beings, a picture is presented in colors."

The famously corrupt Chicago police seem to have an unpleasant relationship with the Zhou Bros. gallery, and have shut down a dangerous series of avant-garde music performances. Sorry to anyone who was planning on coming. Go to the City Visible reading!

all the best,

  ----------------------------
  IRA COHEN BIOGRAPHY

  Ira Cohen was born in 1935. In the 1960s he was in Tangier, where he
edited and published GNAOUA,  which featured William Burroughs, Brion Gysin,
Jack Smith, and Irving Rosenthal. He subsequently became "the  Father of
Mylar Photography," making celebrated photographs in bendable mirrors of
Jimi Hendrix, Charles Ludlam, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Robert  LaVigne,
among others. In 1966 he brought out The Hashish Cookbook under the name of
Panama Rose, and Jilala, an LP record of Moroccan trance music, and two
years later he directed and starred in the award-winning film The Invasion
of  Thunderbolt Pagoda.

  In the 1970s he went to Kathmandu and started the Starstreams Poetry
Series under the Bardo Matrix imprint, publishing on rice paper the work of
writers such as Gregory Corso,  Charles Henri Ford, Angus MacLise, and Paul
Bowles. He also
  published his own work including Poems from the Cosmic Crypt, Seven
Marvels, and Gilded Splinters.

  He has had numerous exhibitions and gallery shows of his photographs
throughout Europe and the United States, and he has photographed many book
and record covers, including John McLaughlin's Devotion, Pharoah Sanders's
Message From Home, and Spirit's The Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. A
silk-screen edition of his Mylar portrait of Jimi Hendrix, called
Reflections, was used on the recent CD The Ultimate Experience. In 2006 he
was invited to give a reading at the Whitney Biennial, which  also featured
an exhibit of his photographs and a showing of The Invasion of  The
Thunderbolt Pagoda, which was released that year as a DVD. His film Kings
with Straw Mats, a documentary of the Indian religious ceremony Kumbh Mela,
is available at Mystic Fire Video. There is an online photo gallery at
www.mysticfire.com of Ira Cohen's portraits of India.

  He is presently working with Will Swofford on the publication of a new
literary arts anthology, Celestial Grafitti, and his photo series "The
Bandaged Poets," edited by Michael Rothenberg and Suzi Winson, will be
released next year from Fish Drum, Inc.Ira Cohen's collections of poetry
include The Stauffenberg Cycle and Other Poems (Holland), From the  Divan of
Petra Vogt (Rotterdam), On Feet of Gold (Synergetic Press), Media  Shamans
Ratio 3 (with Gerard Malanga and Angus MacLise, Temple Press,  England),
Minbad Sinbad, a book of writings and photos dealing with Morocco published
in French (Didier Devillez, Brussels, 1998), Whatever You Say May Be Held
Against You, a book of handwritten poems printed in facsimile  by Shivistan,
Woodstock, New York, Chaos & Glory, published by Elik Press, Salt Lake City,
and Poems from the Akashic Record, published by  Goodie at Panther Press,
New York.

Here's a lovely wedding poem by Raymond Carver entitled "Cherish." Actually, it's a poem that would be perfect for a wedding.


From the window I see her bend to the roses
 holding close to the bloom so as not to
 prick her fingers.  With the other hand she clips, pauses and
 clips, more alone in the world
 than I had known.  She won’t look up, not now.  She’s alone
 with roses and with something else I can only think, not
 say.  I know the names of those bushes
 given for our late wedding: Love, Honor, Cherish –
 the last the rose she holds out to me suddenly, having
 entered the house between glances.  I press
 my nose to it, draw the sweetness in, let it cling – scent
 of promise, of treasure.  My hand on her wrist to bring her close,
 her eyes green as river-moss.  Saying it then, against
 what comes: wife, while I can, while my breath, each hurried petal
 can still find her.

I can sympathize with Mr. Pollet. Again, I avoided the small dealer. In my previous post I mentioned the damage I did to large retail stores, but my really lucrative boost were from museums, especially the National Gallery in Washington D.C. where I presently live. In today's post 9/11 world it would be difficult for a thief to get away with as much as I got away with.

I also think there is potentially very fine work=20
to choose from in Phyllis Webb's marvelous Naked Poems (1965).

Ed Dorn's 24 Love Poems offer some great choices=20
as well. They're in the Collected Poems=20
1956-1974, and at least some of them in the later Selected Poems as well.

Neruda offers some great selections, too.

I have a poem that qualifies, although it's ending is too sentimental, and it's still in the draft stages:

  Presence


  The little girl is afraid of the dark:

                       is it as light as a duck?
                       does a feather feel sad to you?

  Her father reads to her,
  it's a story about her mother, and the life the three of them shared:

                        how old is your anger?
                        does the rain cast a shadow?
                        where does it live?

   What about his story?
   that unwritten chapter
   without an author, Fatherhood

   Which hour wears a promise?
   What month sounds like a  vow and doesn't break?

   The girl listens to her father:

                          how deep is the weather?
                          does your mother still play with you?
                          must snow melt so soon?
                          where does it hide?

  The little girl hears her mother:

                           do dreams float?
                           is my voice a feather?
                           does the moon change colors while she's sleeping?
                           what's taller than a wish?

  Which angel holds in her hand
  your first and last names, and all of their secrets?

EILEEN MYLES READING

TUESDAY OCTOBER 23, 1:00 P.M.

JOAN FLASCH ARTISTS' BOOK COLLECTION
the School of the Art Institute of Chicago
Sharp Building, 37 South Wabash
Flaxman Library, room 508
Free

Eileen Myles is probably America's best-known
unofficial poet. Her latest book is "Sorry, Tree" in
which she describes "some nature" as well as the
transmigration of souls from the east coast to the
west. Bust Magazine calls Myles "the rock star of
modern poetry" and Holland Cotter in The New York
Times describes her as "a cult figure to a generation
of post-punk females forming their own literary avant
garde." Eileen arrived in New York after college, (U.
Mass. (Boston)) gaining the friendship of Allen
Ginsberg, working for poet James Schuyler, becoming a
habitue of the household of Ted Berrigan and Alice
Notley and generally being a notable part of the
turbulent punk and art scene that animated Manhattan's
East Village, giving her first reading at
CBGB's in 1974.

A virtuoso performer of her work - she's read and
performed at colleges, performance spaces, and
bookstores across North America as well as in
Europe, Iceland, Ireland and Russia. She's published
more than 20 volumes of poetry, fiction, articles,
plays and libretti including Hell (an opera with
composer Michael Webster, 2004) Skies, (2001), on my
way, (2001), Cool for You, (a novel, 2000), School of
Fish, (1997), Maxfield Parrish, (1995), Not Me,
(1991), and Chelsea Girls, (stories, 1994). In 1995,
with Liz Kotz, she edited The New Fuck You/Adventures
in Lesbian Reading (Semiotext(e). In 1992 she
conducted an openly female write-in campaign for
President of the United States.  In the 80s
she was Artistic Director of St. Mark's Poetry
Project. In '97 and again in 2007 Eileen toured with
Sister Spit, a post-punk female performance troupe.
She has been a professor of writing at UCSD since
2002. In 2007 she received The Andy Warhol/Creative
Capital art writing fellowship. She contributes
to a wide number of publication including Bookforum,
the Believer, and lately Cabinet, has written
catalogue essays about Sadie Benning, Peggy Awesh and
Nicole Eisenman and she blogs weekly on art at
http://openfordesign.msn.com.

Hello all,

collection of 16 individual chapbooks by 16 poets
working/living/writing in the UK.

Sean Bonney, Emily Critchley, Matt Ffytche, Kai
Fierle-Hedrick, Giles Goodland, Jeff Hilson, Piers
Hugill, Frances Kruk, Jow Lindsay, Marianne Morris,

To order Pilot:

check or cash to:

Matt Chambers
30 Henley Rd.
Buffalo, NY 14216 USA

As a note: I really would like not to charge for this
magazine, but ever since the US Postal Service got rid
of surface shipping, mailing to the UK, etc. has been
very expensive. I apologize for this.

And please send along your mailing address.

All best.
-Matt

Its a nice, sweet poem. Its incessant questioning reminded me of Pablo
Neruda's "Book Of Questions", which are
also sweet, nice, imaginative poems........and of course a little
sentimental.

Thanks for sharing it.

Here are four recent books for which I've written back jacket =
endorsements and which I'd call to everyone's attention:

=20

[Francis Picabia, I Am a Beautiful Monster, translated by Mark =
Lowenthal, MIT Press] "Like a number of other modernist masters - =
Schwitters, Arp, Picasso, Kandinsky - Picabia's reputation as an artist =
has long overshadowed, even hidden, his more than equal achievement as a =
writer and poet.  Now, in Mark Lowenthal's masterful re-creation, the =
secret is finally out.  Picabia emerges here full-blown among his =
contemporaries and as a forerunner to the most adventurous poets of our =
own time.  Beautiful and monstrous by turns the artist and his works =
(his words) are a testament to what happens when a poet creates up to =
and including his limits - and ours."=20

=20

[Hannah Weiner, Hannah Weiner's Open House, edited by Patrick F. Durgin, =
Kenning Editions] "Hannah Weiner's work, so lovingly presented here, =
brought her into the exploration of new ways & means for making poetry - =
a process by which she would have left her mark under any circumstances =
on avant-garde poetics & practice.  The still more remarkable change in =
her later work came, spontaneously, with the onset of an experience, an =
ongoing alteration of perception in which visible words entered her =
field of vision - as cause of wonder & as 'messages' to be included in =
the poems that followed.  If her art both early & late insures her =
standing within the twentieth-century avant-garde, it connects her as =
well to the experience & writings of many traditional poet-mystics =
(clairvoyants in her word for them & for herself).  It is, when taken as =
a whole, an achievement without precedent or comparison among her =
sometimes better-known contemporaries."=20

=20

[Brude Stater, A Labyrinth of Visions, Ahadada Books online edition at =
http://www.ahadadabooks.com/content/view/119/41/]  "To say it quickly: =
Bruce Stater's Labyrinth of Vision is little short of extraordinary - a =
work that ties language to a journey truly taken & a mind in extremis =
that acts to record it.  Stater, as I read him, writes with a sense of =
imaginings that reminds me of a poet like Gerard de Nerval in his =
visionary prose work, Aurelia, where 'dream is a second life' & 'an =
overflow' into the everyday.  As with Nerval & a small company of =
others, then & now, the vision & the language are inseparable: 'a =
journey of remembrance & metaphor,' as the title of Stater's first =
chapter tells us.  If you want to take that as merely literature, feel =
free to do so; it is that & something more: a place where metaphor rings =
true & is - for the duration of the vision - the only truth there is.  =
'It is light, it is dark,' the old Aztecs said in defining their own =
labyrinths, & it is also the mark in Stater's labyrinthine journey of a =
strong new voice in poetry."=20

   =20

[Gabriel Gudding, Rhode Island Notebook, Dalkey Archive Press]  "Poetry, =
wrote Diderot at the beginnings of what would come to be 'our time,' =
must have something in it that is barbaric, vast, & wild.  It is some =
such wildness & vastness (multiplied several times over) that marks =
Gabriel Gudding's unexpurgated & ever-more-inclusive Notebook.  In =
writing or recording it, he creates an ultimate on-the-road poem, =
ranging between the personal & political, the familial (familiar) & the =
transcendent (transformal), while never stopping to apologize or to =
correct.  Seen in that light & its attendant darkness, Rhode Island =
Notebook is a modern/postmodern epic as a poem-including-everything.  An =
incredibly human/humane book at bottom, it is also Gudding's road of =
excess, as Blake once had it, leading him (& us) to the palace of =
wisdom."=20

Hi David:  I thought it should be a review of the book. I just could not see the title info on the Nation website.

 Hope things are well with you David.

---------------

In conjunction with the Cathedral of Saint John the
Divine, Verse Theater Manhattan will present a staged
reading of Robinson Jeffers's 1929 poetic drama, DEAR
JUDAS, this Saturday, October 27th at 4:30PM in the
Cathedral's great nave.  The New York poetry
community's chance to hear this rarely performed
masterpiece takes place as part of the induction of
Jeffers into the Poet's Corner of the Cathedral. DEAR
JUDAS invokes the spirits of Jesus, Judas, Mary and
Lazarus, still restless after two thousand years,
haunting the scenes of Christ's final Passion, and
re-enacting the epic drama of his last days.  In
Jeffers's radical retelling of the biblical narrative,
Judas is transformed into a tragic hero, doomed by his
love for his other-worldly master and condemned by
fate to commit an unforgivable act of betrayal.
Employing the forms of Japanese Noh theater, Jeffers's
gorgeous and energetic verse provides a startling new
perspective on one of the West's most enduring sacred
stories. DEAR JUDAS features Joshua Spafford (Judas),
PJ Sosko (Jesus), Hope Garland (Mary) and Alex Bilu
(Lazarus) and is directed by VTM's artistic director,
James Milton.  We hope you will join us for this
unique and historic event.

where=B9s your favorite poetry bookstore?



I visited berkeley this month and got a chance to visit Jeff Maser books,
which is two or three doors down from SPD.

If you get a chance, this is highly recommended! The collection is amazing,
cases and cases of small press, a warehouse full.
I was able to find works by all the authors I could think of, until my brai=
n
shut down from so much poetry.

I spoke with Jeff Maser, and it turned out that I'd seen much of the
collection before, it used to belong to Richard Aaron / amhere books, in
Philo.=20

There's also a press there, in the warehouse, and they make beautiful
broadsides. The press is called palOmine press. Jeff told me he'd learned
the craft at Occasional Works Press in Menlo Park.

Like a kid in a candy-store, I was unable to think, I couldnt remember the
names of book I was after, so I ended up picking up three palOmine releases=
,
all very beautifully done:

"Pilgrim" by Brian Teare
"i mean you" by john sinclair
"Back Until Then" by James DenBoer

Yes, you can always go to Serendipity in berkeley, but here i have to admit
to being tight-fisted, the prices are pleasing at Maser's

I've heard of Roethke's "I knew a woman" being so used, though I always
thought it odd.

My son, Benjamin Ezra Fox, had me read the first few stanzas of Browning's
"Rabbi Ben Ezra" at his wedding. (Old age never had it so good.)

If you're available to come to one of these poetry readings, I hope you
will.  If you're available but don't know who the hell I am, there are some
links and stuff at http://belz.net  Also, if you're available and don't kno=

who the hell I am but don't want to click on the link, you might consider
coming just to hear one of the other poets, who are very famous and do not
need to self-promote the way I do.

printing of Anne Waldman and Bernadette Mayer's The Basketball =20

The best part, though, was Maser himself. When I called earlier that =20

swell lunch, talking a whole lot more about music than books.

The Grolier Bookshop in Boston has a burst of friendly light about it (new ownership, new manager), great stock (good spread/diversity) of titles , and, on the Friday afternoon that I was there, full of customers on the buy.

 Refreshing.

 Besides Jeff Maser's shop - which is very good for back list and out of print titles - Pegasus and Moe's and Black Oak - are pretty responsive to new stuff, suggestions, etc.

 In San Francisco it is still pretty much Green Apple (where George Albon has influence) and City Lights Bookshop.

THE SUPPRESSION OF DISSENT IN THE UNITED STATES
With JULES BOYKOFF, KATYA KOMISARUK, and a representative of the SF8
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26 at 7:00 PM
New College Theater / 777 Valencia Street, San Francisco
5-10 donation to benefit the SF8 Defense (no one turned away)

Eight former Black Panthers were arrested earlier this year on charges rela=
ted to the 1971 killing of a San Francisco police officer. Similar charges =
had been thrown out in 1973, after it was revealed that police used torture=
 to extract confessions from some of the same men. Unfortunately, such stat=
e repression of social movements is far from unusual in the US. Please join=
 us for an evening of speakers about the history and current reality of gov=
ernment repression, as well as counter-strategies activists can use to comb=
at it.

Jules Boykoff is a political science professor at Pacific University and au=
thor of the new book BEYOND BULLETS: THE SUPPRESSION OF DISSENT IN THE UNIT=
ED STATES. He will discuss the tactics used by US government agents to unde=
rmine the long-term viability of movements for political, social, and econo=
mic change.

Katya Komisaruk applied to Harvard law school while serving a five-year pri=
son sentence for civil disobedience, and has now been a criminal defense an=
d civil rights lawyer for over a decade. She is also the author of the indi=
spensable BEAT THE HEAT: HOW TO HANDLE ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. She=
 will offer informed, practical suggestions of what activists can do in the=
 face of repression.

A representative of the SF8 will also be on hand to give an update on their=
 case and tell us how we can get involved in supporting their defense.

Most poetry?  Best prices?  Best shop?  Stop in AND/OR go online to
Longhousepoetry.com--and while you visit, check out Bob and Susan Arnold's
magnificent online anthology (soon-to-be-a- for-sale as a CD)  , "Origin"--a
number of you
are in it.  Plus, it would be good not only to support the Arnolds, but to
support
Janine Vega whose "poetry reading" CD is offered exclusively via Longhouse.

I went to Jeff Maser's on one of my bay area family/boog trips a few
years back on the recommendation of the poet Kent Taylor, one of d.a.
levy's best friends back in the day. Maser has recently bought the
contents of the late Jim Lowell's Asphodel Bookshop, a vital part of
the Cleveland Scene in the sixties and which remained open until
Lowell's passing.

It was remarkable to go to this little corner in this pretty warehouse
bldg with all of these books from Lowell's store. It was my first real
chance to actually touch anything that levy had actually produced.

and everything around the shop was equally wondrous. the three main
things i remember i picked up that afternoon were this tiny book levy
made, the author i can't remember, using old maps; an anne waldman
broadside that folded down had her picture on the front and name
below, and opened up from the bottom had a poem on the inside; a first
printing of Anne Waldman and Bernadette Mayer's The Basketball
Article, a collaborative essay on basketball originally published in
Oui magazine; and a couple of pocket poets to fill holes in my set.

The best part, though, was Maser himself. When I called earlier that
day for directions from the Bart he told me to just call when i
arrived and that he'd pick me up. And then, a while later I'm looking
through the old Asphodel stock for an hour or so, and then he comes
back to me and asks if I'm hungry. I tell him, yeah, I could use a
bite. So he invites me to go to mexican for lunch with him and his
girlfriend. Once there he won't let me pay, and the three of us have a
swell lunch, talking a whole lot more about music than books.

	Haki R. Madhubuti has written some of the most important poetry of the
last fifty years and he is without question one of the preeminent poets
writing in America today.

	This his eleventh book of poetry, Run Toward Fear: New Poems and A
Poet’s Handbook, is divided into two main sections: a portion of new
poems and, at the back, a handbook of advice for poets young and old.
The first line of the first of the forty poems declares, “It is the
poets who run toward fear.” And the first of the forty enumerated
aphorisms of advice in “The Poet’s Handbook” at the back begins, “Learn
to ‘run toward fear.’” It is a sentiment repeated throughout the book:
“The highest mandate a poet has (other than writing the strongest poems
that she or he is capable of) is to be in the vanguard with others in
the pursuit of freedom and justice for all” (67).

	This book is a commanding and potent statement of the redemptive power
and political essence of art and love, and it contains more apothegmatic
addresses to and imperative phrases for the reader than probably any
other poetry book I’ve read. Its mode is instructive, pedagogic,
unabashedly inspirational, palliative, and its tone is by turns
avuncular, elegiac, lyric, fiery and plain spoken. Professor Madhubuti
has not written a twee, aestheticist, elegant collection, but a work of
nurturant pragmatic force.

	Insofar as the entire book amounts to a manual of instruction about how
to triumph, in art, spiritually, democratically, intellectually, and
emotionally, residing continually in the local, in the face of
systematic oppressive othering, the management of emotions (by judges,
employers, police), the pervasive maintenance of economic, gender,
racial and ethnic boundaries, regulated discourse, disenfranchisement
from wider “whiter” corporate power networks, and the regular
vicissitudes of mortal life – insofar as this book does this, and does
it triumphantly, it is poetry of the highest kind. It is a poetry
enthroned in history.

	In “Why Shani?,” a poem dedicated “For  the Baraka Family” and
remarking upon the murder of Amina and Amiri Baraka’s youngest daughter,
Shani Isis Makeda Jones Baraka, then 32, Madhubuti writes,

“to rise from unanswerable pain
requires a history beyond the acquisition of things,
demands work on the other side of self and self.
you have labored and researched the catalogs of the world
& refused to be separated from the poor and poorer.

your love is uncorrupted and contagious,
grounded in your arts, activism, and the familial.
we reciprocate.” (21)

	This is a poetry tightly rooted in the American pragmatist tradition
stretching back through Ralph Ellison, William Carlos Williams, W. E. B.
Du Bois, John Dewey, William James, Emerson and beyond. In fact, this
book -- insofar as it is, generically speaking, in great part
essentially a handbook of conduct -- has roots that could be said to
reach all the way back to the great pragmatist Stoic philosopher
Epictetus, born a Greek slave, whose Enchiridion, which means manual or
handbook, is a collection of pragmatic aphorisms for living one’s life
in the face of adversity.

	In other words, Run Toward Fear is as much a book of poems as it is an
ars vivendi. It is for this reason one of the most unusual and
satisfying books of poetry I have ever read. These are poems whose
pleasures derive from their utility: Twenty-two of the forty poems bear
some italic text at the bottom explaining the purpose and occasion of
the poem, e.g., “Remembering the children of Kosovo,” or “For the
teachers of poetry,” or “For Margaret Walker Alexander, 1915-1998.” This
is a poetics embedded in the local in a way fundamentally contrary to
aestheticism and its pretensions toward universal cultural value.

	In his autobiography William Carlos Williams quotes John Dewey: “The
local is the only universal, upon that all art builds.” If the very
existence of aestheticism is founded upon the dismissal of history and
the local, then this book is the farthest thing from aestheticist as you
can get. The school of quietude, so prevalent in American poetry since
the rise of the New Criticism, has insisted that poetry (and poetry
especially of all the genres) has no, and can have no, active political
force in the world. Madhubuti works then in the radical political
tradition of all great writers, not just great Black writers, when he
declares, “The best poets find peace in themselves and work incessantly
to find it in others, their surroundings, and on more than one occasion
write poems about the necessity and possibility of a world at peace.”
(61) Note that he does not say the best poets satisfy aesthetic
conventions: he says simply they find peace. A better standard for great
writing cannot be found.

	This book is then about finding peace through history, family,
connection, and the genius that rises from them and must learn to run
toward fear if it is to survive: the relations among real people are
named on page after page, as in his tribute, “Our Daughter on Loan,” an
elegy for Kevani Zelpa Moyo, the daughter of Kimya and Kofi Moyo, dead
at age 17:

[…]
your history was still in discovery
as grandmothers, big mommas and babas declared,
“you were on loan to us,”
not a borrowed book or pawn shop watch.
your visit among us is still mystery and melody,
“tweety” birds with rhythm in their eyes.

your mother is a southern river,
your father a strong stone with baggage,
your family is Black stories, deep crops,
gathering winds, Black hurricanes in waiting.
you were washed in love and possibilities,
sun bathed in smiles, tunes and cultural signatures.
why you leave us so soon?

			For Kevani Zelpah Moyo
				        (1982-1999)           (30)

I believe Haki Madhubuti would concur with Lynn Worsham, who, in her
essay “Going Postal: Pedagogic Violence and the Schooling of Emotion,”
declares “that if our commitment is to real individual and social
change…then the work of decolonization must occur at the affective
level, not only to reconstitute the emotional life of the individual but
also, and more importantly, to reconstruct the feeling or mood that
characterizes an age. To be sure, our most urgent political and
pedagogical task remains the fundamental reeducation of emotion.” I
believe it is this very project that has tasked Madhubuti since his
first book as Don L. Lee, Don’t Cry, Scream. And he has chosen with this
book to highlight a lesson that is relevant now and will remain so for
as long as civility, love, and happiness are threatened by the violence
of ignorant men and unjust structures: that unless those who make art,
and those whom art makes, first realize the extent of their fear, and
then act upon it and see it for what it is -- a tool wielded against us
by “the bomb users, greed promoters, career politicians, corporate
plastic makers, armies of money-makers, pleasure-over-principle
advocates, proponents of artificial food” (67) -- we cannot be free. And
poets are especially tasked, he says, for,

“The determined force of any age is the poem, old as
ideas and as lifegiving as active lovers. A part of any
answer is in the rhythm of the people; their heartbeat
comes urgently in two universal forms, music and poetry.
for the reader	   for the quiet seeker
for the many willing to sacrifice one syllable
mumblings and easy conclusions
poetry
can be the gigantic river
that allows one to recognize
in the circle of fire

I'm wondering what folks thinkg about Joel Brouwer's NYT's review of Alice
Notley's most recent book, "In the Pines."  To me his take is a bit off.  He
writes:

"Notley’s ambition is different; she seeks to establish or continue no
tradition except one that literally can’t exist — the celebration of the
singular thought sung at a particular instant in a unique voice — and it
seems she’s getting closer to it all the time."

The poem, as I read it, points to something quite different:  it is,
afterall, a self-proclaimed folk process, and rather than emphasizing how a
"singular voice in a particular instant" it seems to be pointing to the
haunting felt and heard presence of  multitudes of voices--the poet as
shaman.
He also makes an odd distinction between the "nervous surfaces" of the poem
and the voice beneath, as if these were distinct. Finally, the strength of
the poem, he writes, is its charm.  This is a poem that deals with death,
disease, mental illness and has at times a deeply menacing, and beautiful,
quality. Charm?  Would be curious what other people think.  And, Joel, if
you are out there, would be great to hear from you.

 Besides Jeff Maser's shop - which is very good for back list and out of

 In San Francisco it is still pretty much Green Apple (where George Albon

I visited berkeley this month and got a chance to visit Jeff Maser books,
which is two or three doors down from SPD.

If you get a chance, this is highly recommended! The collection is amazing,
cases and cases of small press, a warehouse full.
I was able to find works by all the authors I could think of, until my brai=

shut down from so much poetry.

I spoke with Jeff Maser, and it turned out that I'd seen much of the
collection before, it used to belong to Richard Aaron / amhere books, in
Philo.=20

There's also a press there, in the warehouse, and they make beautiful
broadsides. The press is called palOmine press. Jeff told me he'd learned
the craft at Occasional Works Press in Menlo Park.

Like a kid in a candy-store, I was unable to think, I couldnt remember the

,
all very beautifully done:

"Pilgrim" by Brian Teare
"i mean you" by john sinclair
"Back Until Then" by James DenBoer

Yes, you can always go to Serendipity in berkeley, but here i have to admit
to being tight-fisted, the prices are pleasing at Maser's

*THE SUPPRESSION OF DISSENT IN THE UNITED STATES*

With JULES BOYKOFF, KATYA KOMISARUK, and a representative of the SF8
Friday Oct. 26th
07:00 PM - 09:00 PM
New College Theater, 777 Valencia Street
$5-10 donation to benefit the SF8 Defense (no one turned away)

Eight former Black Panthers were arrested earlier this year on charges
related to the 1971 killing of a San Francisco police officer. Similar
charges had been thrown out in 1973, after it was revealed that police
used torture to extract confessions from some of the same men.
Unfortunately, such state repression of social movements is far from
unusual in the US. Please join us for an evening of speakers about the
history and current reality of government repression, as well as
counter-strategies activists can use to combat it.

Jules Boykoff is a poet and political science professor at Pacific
University and author of the new book BEYOND BULLETS: THE SUPPRESSION OF
DISSENT IN THE UNITED STATES. He will discuss the tactics used by US
government agents to undermine the long-term viability of movements for
political, social, and economic change.

Katya Komisaruk applied to Harvard law school while serving a five-year
prison sentence for civil disobedience, and has been a criminal defense
and civil rights lawyer for over a decade. She is also the author of the
indispensable BEAT THE HEAT: HOW TO HANDLE ENCOUNTERS WITH LAW
ENFORCEMENT. She will offer informed, practical suggestions of what
activists can do in the face of repression.

A representative of the SF8 will also be on hand to give an update on
their case and tell us how we can get involved in supporting their defense.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Has anyone read Heidegger's "Poetry Language Thought?" It's a beautiful book. It's late Heidegger, during, what he called "the turning." He no longer called what he did philosophy. He simply called it "thinking." Being there in German is Dasein. Dasein was Heidegger's dialogue with the world.

  As for his political stance, I only know that he was deeply suspicious of modernity. He was expelled from the University of Frieburg for refusing to censor Nietzsche anti/anti Semitic writings. Hannah Arent, his lover at one time, defended him to the end. Heidegger was in no way a proponent of racial theories of any type. & Heidegger, as far as his being duped by political bullshit,  is certainly not alone among major 20th century artist & thinkers.

She studied with James at Johns Hopkins, and there is a funny little story about her deciding not to take an exam he once gave.  He encouraged her greatly (and gave her an A the day she wrote the note claiming she didn't feel like taking a test).  She left the medical program about a semester before graduation.

yes, that is a beautiful book

and, well . . . he also suppressed the dedication to Husserl of his most famous
book when that became inconvenient during the Nazi era -- and the infamous
rector's address is infamous for good reason --

all of which simply means that we should keep reading him for all that we can
learn -- including the humbling lessons of his mast hateful moments --

No, James's entire academic career was spent at Harvard. Stein attended Radcliff 1893-97(according to Wikipedia), and it was there that she encountered James, though it is true that she did subsequently attend Johns Hopkins Medical School, which she left without a degree.

  I only mention this in order to avoid thinking about Heidegger, of course.

A place  i keep finding a great many excellent books in their first editions
for fity cent paper and a dollar hardback is the Book Seller Cafe at the
Public Library in Milwaukee.  Books from the 60's and 70's by bp Nichol,
LeRoi Jones, Jackson MacLow, John Wieners, Jack Micheline, R. Waldrop, Susan
Howe, Charles Olson, Theodore Enslin, Robert Creeley, etc etc.
      But best of all is Woodland Pattern Book Center.  Besides being one of
the best poetry bookstores there is, it also is one of the leading places
for readings, talks, workshops, as well as art, book art, music and
experimental film screenings-- and has large sections of American Indian
literature, history, poetry, children's books, Middle eastern, Latin
American Asian/Asian American wrting, fiction, art books, film, visual
poetry--chaps and broadsides, journals--
      My favorites are always going to be used places, yard sales and
finding books on the street being thrown out--the used found books are
unexpected surprises and editions often one never knew of--often older ones
much better made than current editions--or recent books at a fraction the
price--in a used store, Salvation Army, dumpster, roadside box, yard sales,
the book Seller cafe, the excitement of the unknown that one finds and finds
one--the completely unexpected book that leaps out of the past or another
language--an obscure edition--talismanic-- already with a life of its own--
     Sometimes among new books, it's very exciting, then very confining.
All the "must reads," "instants classics," "language revelations," best
poetry book of the year," and "good for you" "buy this book" patter of the
blurbographers   weighing in with Great Authority.  Suddenly, as a reader,
you feel like you're being not so much instructed as constructed--and it's
time to slip back out to walk along and find a promising looking junk heap.
      Otherwise you're not yourself anymore, but someone else's idea of who
and what you should be, who and what you should read, and what crowd you
should join in with.  Sounds like it might be kind of a trap, doesn't it?--
    The first place i bought poetry books probably forever set me in this
direction.  It was a book stall at the huge  Saturday outdoor market on the
Boulevard des Lices in Arles, France.  A squat Provencal gentleman in a blue
smock ran it.  He always wore a battered old cap and had either a Gauloise
or a long grass blade dangling in a corner of his mouth and glass of country
wine close to hand.  He also worked as a seasonal farmhand and all this time
outdoors had given him a skin the color and texture of of a rutted ochre
clay country road.  He noticed I was buying poetry books--very cheap older
popular editions of Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Nerval, Apollinaire, Reverdy etc--
and his cinema tomes, so each week would turn up with some volumes he'd
unearthed he hoped I might find interesting.  He'd turn up some amazing
things.
        It turned out M. Bosco  (also the name of a well known writer, Henri
Bosco, much quoted by Bachelard) didn't even like to read at all, but had
more or less come into the business by default.  It had belonged to a
childhood friend of his whom he used to help out on the big market days when
he didn't have farm work in hand.  Over time, the friend taught him the
rudimentary aspects of the buiness and introduced him to many of his sources
of texts, scattered around an eccentrically shaped area of Provence.  One
day, at the Bouldevard des Lices, his friend told him he was going to a cafe
to meet a couple pals and play some cards for a while.  He promised to be
back by late afternoon.
       He never returned and M. Bosco never was able to find a trace of him
and neither were the local police.  Apparently it was M. Bosco's fate to
become a book stall owner, traveling from town to town and dealing in a
merchandise he had no real interest in.
       But all things happen for a reason, M. Bosco said.  If i hadn't had
this stall at the markets, I wouldn't have met my wife.  She owns a house, a
nice one, and some good property, good land, and so I have a real home. I
used to fear I might always be an itinerant laborer with no fixed place of
residence. Now I know just where i'll sleep every night.  My friend did me a
very good turn and wherever he is I hope he knows how thankful I am to him.
       And I'm very thankful to him for you to  be here with these good
books for me, too, says I.  So we had a good smoke on that.
       When the book seller has the books as it were fall into his life, it
inspires one to be open to all the opportunities in which books can fall
into one's own life--and many other things--("I do not seek, I
find"--Picasso)

I read a book by Heidegger on poetry, although I no longer remember what it was titled.  I found it impenetrable and threw the book out.  Sorry, maybe it was a bad translation.  Regards, Tom Savage

As for his political stance, I only know that he was deeply suspicious of modernity. He was expelled from the University of Frieburg for refusing to censor Nietzsche anti/anti Semitic writings. Hannah Arent, his lover at one time, defended him to the end. Heidegger was in no way a proponent of racial theories of any type. & Heidegger, as far as his being duped by political bullshit, is certainly not alone among major 20th century artist & thinkers.

Barry,

Great review. I was especially glad to see connections made between
Picabia's work and contemporary poetry. There are a few Dada
poets--particularly Tzara and Picabia--who, in my opinion, have been
overlooked in America due to the popular image of Dada but whose work
was highly developed and complex, using techniques that make them look
almost like contemporaries at times.

It amazes me that the techniques used by Picabia and Tzara are
applauded when used by poets like John Ashbery, David Shapiro, John
Yau, etc. but are completely ignored when they appear in Picabia and
Tzara's work. This isn't to say that I don't want to see Ashbery,
Shapiro, or Yau applauded--on the contrary, I think their discovery,
re-invention, and interpretation of collage, "abstraction," and
colorful intensity is often breathtaking--but I would like it if
American readers would stop being blinded by the Dada manifestos and
actually pay attention to a couple of very powerful poets.

Thanks for the reminder, Diane. To think my daughter, Pearl (now 27) was born at home on 153 Chenery (too)! (Just a few doors up from Fairmont School).

 Glad B & B has a bigger foothold.

 Be well,

The Grolier Bookshop in Boston has a burst of friendly light about it (new
ownership, new manager), great stock (good spread/diversity) of titles ,
and, on the Friday afternoon that I was there, full of customers on the buy.

 Refreshing.

 Besides Jeff Maser's shop - which is very good for back list and out of
print titles - Pegasus and Moe's and Black Oak - are pretty responsive to
new stuff, suggestions, etc.

 In San Francisco it is still pretty much Green Apple (where George Albon
has influence) and City Lights Bookshop.

If you're in Berkeley, don't miss Pegasus Books -- the downtown branch =
on
Shattuck, where Clay Banes (of Eyeball Hatred blog fame) does the poetry
buying.  He keeps the store well-stocked with an excellent selection of =
hot
new poetry titles - stuff you wouldn't have found at Cody's & you won't =
find
at Moe's.  There are often some treasures buried in the used section, =
too --
which are priced much lower than they would be at Jeff Maser's or at
Serendipity...

Clay also runs an excellent reading series there -- check out his blog =
for
the schedule (I think it's claytonbanes.blogspot.com )

Brother, You need to look more closely
under the Heidegger's hood - seductive
writing - compelling - but he was a nazi
as evidenced in his writing of '30s
including in his turn re. what happened
with CONTRIBUTION TO PHILOSOPHY, which
while thoroughly deep is laced with
anti-semitisms. He's a mixed bag - take
from it what you can that's useful.

Best as ever,
Sam

Greetings Kuffar & Non-kuffar:

If there were a travelling lecture show many hundreds of years ago against =
Inquisitionist ideology (representing a minority of Christiandom) - darn th=
ose Catholic fascists - even if the speakers were reactionaries, would we p=
rotest that/them?

So how about this "so-called Terrorism Awareness Project"?

What is their "intolerant" message?

What is their "phobic" message?

Who are the "extremist speakers" and why are they "extreme"?

From my experience living in the Arab-Muslim world since 2000, this place s=
eems to be a hotbed of phobias: Christophobia, Judeophobia, Secular-phobia,=
 Humanism-phobia, Iconophobia, Xenophobia...

...and Blame-Everyone-But-Us-For-Everything-Philia.

I had never really experienced a real anti-Semetic environment until I star=
ted living in the Middle East. (Most people here will say to us outsiders "=
we love the Jews; we just hate the Zionists.") One of my colleagues - a Mus=
lim female - last year insisted to me that "EVERYbody hates the Jews." I di=
dn't know that - "everybody"?

I was shocked - "racism and bigotry!" right?

One of my students has a Malay mother and American father. (I don't know if=
 he converted before or for marrying her mother.) She told me that he had q=
uite the experience here. Since he's a white American, no one thought he co=
uld be a Muslim. But once his colleagues discovered he was a brother Muslim=
, they started making all these hateful comments about "the Jews" to him. H=
e was shocked.

I have angered people (whether my fault or not) and they have called me "Je=
w" as an insult. This one young minibus driver in Muscat whom I kept tellin=
g to stop turning around and to watch the road, yelled, "You Jew" at me as =
he drove away. I just laughed and tried to yell back at him, "You Arab," bu=
t I couldn't because I was laughing at his attempt at an insult. That's the=
 reason I tried to yell back what I did - I thought it was a ridiculous thi=
ng to say, to consider an insult.

You should see these costume dramas on TV here during Ramadan. Sometimes th=
ere are the evil Jews and the evil Christians in them, reinforcing the ounc=
e-and-future Muslim Empire's foundation myths.

Back to the email topic...

Of course, not to be out-done by their so-called enemy, "Terrorism Awarenes=
s Project" is prime double-speak. Yes, these things can be like the 5 minut=
e hate in *1984*. I agree.

OK. So now I looked at the link which lists some possible speakers:

"Ann Coulter, who recently made quite a splash with her unabashed Jew-hatre=
d"

Yes, AC has been a total wack-job everytime I've heard her open her mouth.

"Robert Spencer, who calls Islam, "the world's most intolerant religion"

So, why can't he say that? Would any of us protest if he'd said the same ab=
out Christianity? Do you think Shari'a Law would accept such things as the =
US Bill of Rights or the UN Charter on Human Rights? No, they are actually =
quite opposed on several points.

We may disagree with Spencer's mission or attitude or conclusions, but his =
analysis is strictly text-based from the Qu'ran and Hadith. I've read one o=
f his books. I would like to hear him in a free and open debate with a poli=
tically-correct, Islam-is-the-religion-of-peace-and-tolerance-type Imam.

"Rick Santorum, who compared homosexuality to incest and bestiality"

Yup, RS is another wack-job. But I don't know what this quote has to do wit=
h the topic. Oh well. Insantorum is just speaking in the spirit of the Old =
Testament, which by the way often sounds a lot like the Qur'an and Hadith, =
especially the the violent passages.

"And of course, David Horowitz whose long history of racism has included at=
tacks on affirmative action and the statement that 'guns don't kill black p=
eople, other blacks do.'"

Oh yeah, DH just can't get over being a bad little boy in the 60s and has b=
een begging for forgiveness ever since.

Anyway, are we suposed to have good poet opinions, and stand in line, on af=
firmative action and gun violence? What would they be? I probably already h=
ave them but I just feel weird that certain ones may be expected of me.

Anyway, I guess I'm replying here because I feel that just about every publ=
ic side of this so-called debate (Islamophobia vs. Islamofascism) too often=
 tends to be  over-simplified.

Remember, to us these "conservative" speakers sound like Al Gore sounds to =
them. You can bet that the Nobel Peace Prize story was told very differentl=
y on Fox than on Al-Jazeerah. (It's a hoot switching back and forth.)

If the Muslim Empire (under the Ottomans) had not finally been turned back =
at Vienna, how different would Europe and the Americas be today?

Whenever I implore my students to have anti-war and pro-peace rallies (as o=
pposed to the "death to [...]" demonstrations we all see on TV) because "Is=
lam is the religion of peace that's been hijacked," they say...when they fi=
nally say something...that they feel that they might get hurt by their fell=
ow Muslims for taking a public stand against alleged jihadism and alleged t=
errorism. (More likely their families could get deported, which is the main=
 tool of social control in the Gulf with its innumerable expatriates. The g=
overnment also controls Mosque preaching so it is not inflamatory.) And tha=
t's here in the UAE - a very "tolerant" and laidback place.

Such lynchings have been documented in Gaza.

Man, that's tolerence!

Perhaps "Unoppressive Non-Imperialist Bargain Books"
in the West Village, Manhattan, 34 Carmine (at
Bleecker St.)  A small eccentric shop, you can't
really go there with the expectation of perhaps
finding whatever you are currently interested in, but
rather you can check out the categories the owner(s)
are interested in, including books by and about
William Blake. I forget what else, as I haven't been
there for a long time.  When mosying around the
confusing weirdly-arranged streets around the Film
Forum when I had some time before a movie, sometimes
this store would suddenly loom into view.  They're
closing at the end of the year, though, according to
an ad of theirs I saw in the latest issue of the
(ghost of itself)  Village Voice.

Great insight and very true. I haven't read Picabia (will read soon) but
Tzara's poetry
often seems fresher than experimental poetry written today beyond place.
There is
an old book by Paul Carrol - The Poem In Its Skin where he discusses John
Ashbery's
starkly dadaist poem "Leaving the Atocha Station" in conjunction with a
Tzara poem
to reveal the dada quality in early Ashbery.

In fact I have often wondered if anyone did a comparative study of Abstract
Expressionist
paintings and Dada poetry - they fit each other so well.

GS studied w/ James at the "Harvard Annex," later to be known as
Radcliffe.  But with regard to the original question, i guess that means
it was Frost and not Williams (who went to UPenn, i believe, w/ Ezra
Pound), who *also* studied w/ James at Harvard. ??

Heidegger was basically spineless when it came to
politics. His rectorial address is about as bad as it
gets (something like "the Fuhrer is the only,
ultimate, and sole reality"). He did nothing to defend
Husserl's dismissal from Freiburg, based entirely on
his Jewishness.

His thought is, at many places throughout his career,
fascinating, beautiful, useful, irreplaceable. As a
way of thinking as an ongoing activity, an open
process that isn't obsessed with results, it's perhaps
unparalleled. Some of the philosophy that has actually
often come to mind in relation to my everyday
experience.

And he gets tripped up on the very conceptual baggage
he claims to avoid, confusing the productive
tentativity with which he never-quite-defines his
jargon with the vagueness of authoritarian power
(wonderful books that would otherwise end in
frustrating inconclusiveness are capped off with
statements like "we must bow down before the
mystery"). When lessons can't be learned from this
sort of thing, I've found that the best response is to
make fun of him--which has also been the case when
reading some of his best stuff, and is why I always
refer to him as "Heidi," imagining him skipping around
in his little mountain knickers...

I like a lot of "Poetry, Language, Thought." I often
think his writing on poetry is nonsense, though, and
that the poets themselves always do better. "The
Origin of the Work of Art" has been a really
productive text to struggle with--the ideas of "earth"
and "world," I find, constantly reveal new and
illuminating facets. At the same time, I'm troubled
there, and all over Heidi, by the emphasis on
rootedness, "establishing nations," peoples, gods... I
have an essay from college I've been meaning to
de-academize that contrasts the "establishing" trend
in that essay with Silliman's "Tjanting" as an artwork
(one of many) that enacts phenomenology in a loosening
way, dehabituating, opening up a "world" constantly
even as it "sets it up."

There's a much better translation, incidentally, in
the Cambridge edition of "Holzwege."

Anyway, I'm for it.

Damn right we should be critical of what we read, underlying assumptions, e=
tc.

But when a discussion of this type pops up, I always end up wondering, "Why=
 aren't we just as critical of so-called Communist [poets] as we are of the=
 so-called Fascists?"

Or is that a false anology?

It's just I hear "s/he was personally a fascist" dismissively hung around t=
he necks of [poets and philosphers], but I never hear similar conclusive ju=
dgements about writers of any other socio-political stance. Or maybe I'm no=
t listening.

(Hey, was Dante an "Islamophobe"? He shoved Mohammed into Hell as a "schism=
atic" in the *Inferno*, didn't he? Does that make Dante a "Christofascist"?=
)

When we read [poets, philosophers, historians] from bygone eras, perhaps th=
e ancient world, do we consider what their socio-political positions were f=
or any reason other than to delve into the context of their time?

I don't think we use the same readerly objectivity on writers since the end=
 of the 19 century. Now it's personal.

Generally speaking, as I've travelled outside The West I've been astonished=
 at how many people personally consider classism, racism, and sexism to be =
the normal, natural order of the world and any arguments against such as co=
ntrary to human nature. I have noticed much of the world still thinks these=
 socio-political stances are correct.

I wonder if any great writers today from any of these countries subscribe t=
o any of these world views? If they do, should I multiculturally accept the=
m, or ideologically denounce them, or both, or niether?

I don't know.

Yeah, yeah - this is the same old debate of whether an [artist's] personal =
behavior or political views should affect our relationship with their [arti=
stic] activity.

i checked out the Der Spiegel interview after reading your post. he's questioned on both matters. his answer to the rector's address isn't very convincing. on Husserl, i believe him. he calls his treatment of Husser "a human error" and goes on to state that he sent Husserl an apology. i suppose there's no point in trying to defend his blunders. i simply think the totality of his life should be kept in perspective. Shortly before Richard Rorty died, he wrote (I'm paraphrasing), Heidegger was the best Philosopher of the 20th century, but a political coward. I'm not so sure that's fair.



ALDON L NIELSEN <aln10@PSU.EDU> wrote:  yes, that is a beautiful book

and, well . . . he also suppressed the dedication to Husserl of his most famous
book when that became inconvenient during the Nazi era -- and the infamous
rector's address is infamous for good reason --

all of which simply means that we should keep reading him for all that we can
learn -- including the humbling lessons of his mast hateful moments --

I haven't read the Contribution. I'll check it out. If this piece is laced with anti- semitism, it's unlike any Heidegger I've read so far. Whatever it was about the Volk ... why he felt there was some "inner truth" to National Socialism ... some way to preserve German Identity against the onslaught of technological modernity, there, I think, is where Heidegger's thinking might be revealing.  I share some of Heidegger's phobia concerning technology, agriculture, etc. Still, maybe I do need to "look more closely under Heidegger's hood."

My favorite is still Boox/Books, the original name for Woodland
Patterns in Milw.  I remember the first time I saw it when I was
young, I couldn't figure out the weird spelling.  How times have
changed, as they say.  I think they changed the name in the late 70s.

A few years back I had a blog hosted by Blogger, which I deleted after
several months of daily blogging. For me, it was a temporary thing to
sound out my poetics and connect with poets. When it stopped being fun
I deleted the blog thinking that would be the end of it. Withina short
time another user obtained the same URL, retrieved my old posts frrom
somewhere--probably Google Cache--and reposted them, even using my
name on the site. After several months of back and forth with Google
Legal, they finally forced removed my posts from the doppelganger
site. It turns out, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act protects such
posts. If you have a blog and you want to stop, it might be better to
delete posts but leave the blog active. Otherwise you might end up
needing the 12-step program of letters to Blogger Legal, etc.

Some poets out there still include a link to my old blog
pornfeld_dot_blogspot_dot_com. I haven't operated that blog for almost
three years. I do have a personal website at myname.com.

can you elaborate on what you find unfair abt rorty's assessment? it
seems to give him his due, and at the same time point out the obvious.
not every brilliant person is also a model of political courage, and i
find it actually reassuring and somewhat refreshing to have that pointed
out. who knows what many of us would do in the same situation, but let's
tell it like it is.

Shortly before Richard Rorty died, he wrote (I'm paraphrasing), Heidegger was the best Philosopher of the 20th century, but a political coward. I'm not so sure that's fair.

Yes, I agree--need to drink with a long spoon - the same as we measure Dant=
e, as well posited - and I think underlying it is a standards' issue viz. w=
e expect better behavior from a philosopher than a poet, oddly - and I don'=
t know why - particularly for me in light of the fact I hold poets, not phi=
losophers, must become kings if our beings are to run on real time. But it =
is of a piece - as Joyce said re. Yeats (blue shirt), "show me the man" - a=
nd Heidegger conveyed, laid out, a way - held up a light - but seeing such =
I think we need to consider the shape of the lantern - too with Eliot and P=
ound among others of era. Williams on the other hand called it, of course. =

Stein at proto-Radcliffe.  Stevens, not Williams.  Stevens also went
to Harvard, but I don't think he studied with James there.  He took a
few courses, went on to NYU law.

on the Heidegger & fascism thing, I did some work years ago when the
Farias book came out, and that essay is available on EPC (http://
writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/joris/heideggerfascism.html) and may
still be of use for anyone coming new to the question.

I forgot to mention a tiny bookstore in Midcoast Maine:  The Personal Book Shop, on Main Street in Thomaston, Maine (just down the street from the Maine Prison Store). The shop is run by a very cool woman, Marty.  Although she carries more than poetry books, she is very attuned to the poetry vibe in Maine and hosts many poetry readings in her cozy little shop.  If she doesn't have what you want, she will go to great lengths to get it.  Stop in if you're in the Camden/Rockland/Thomaston area.  Tell her I sent you!

Dear Stephen and Barry:

Apologies for the delay in responding--i began this Sunday and ever since
have been experiencing the interrelationship of the intermittent with the
interminable--intermittently being able to write a few words among
interminable interruptions, making the intermittent entries become an
interminable project unless ----put it this way--i better be done in time
for Game One of the "World Serious" as Ring Lardner's characters call it--

Thank you very much for the review Barry--i am very much looking forward to
reading the book and liked your review--
the question i bring up here--is more of a general one which also includes
the review, but only a tiny tiny bit of the review--
i shd also mention that at one point Picabia was a friend of Gertrude
Stein's
and before people think otherwise i have been a fan of her works for so lon=
g
a time it is impossible for me to grasp actually having able to traverse so
many eons--who knows, perhaps i, too, was a friend of Gertrude Stein's and
am just suffering from  temporary amnesia?  I do recall going to the place
in Paris, but not finding any one at home at the time . . .


The copy of the Picabia book i found at the Schwarz indie bookstore  (yet t=
o
check library) is shrink wrapped, so only had the opportunity to peruse the
prose stylings of the blurbographers, including of course Jerome Rothenberg=
,
who sent his to this list.  The others are Charles Bernstein, Marjorie
Perloff & David Antin.  If one includes Barry's use of Silliman's "torque"
in his review and Rothenberg's Novalis quote that "Language is Delphi," the
implication is that Picabia is a sort of proto-Language poet. Or even an
honorary member--"one of our contemporaries."
        This brings up some interesting questions about the nature of the
perceptions of the productions  of time when  examined through lenses groun=
d
and polished to the present's  specifications.
      I am looking forward to reading the book to see--or read Picabia's
Collected works to find--if he anywhere writes out various ideas of his own
about the techniques he is employing which Barry uses the word "torgue"
for.  An interesting effect of using this word is that, rather than giving
the impression that Picabia's work long ago did what is  for some time now
claimed to be  the provenance uniquely of American poetry, it instead  give=
s
the impression that Picabia's work is being turned retrospectively into a
branch of Language Poetry by virtue of this assocaition.  All of the blurbs
keep saying that Picabia is "one of our contemporaries".  From another poin=
t
of view would not this indicate in fact how reactionary the present is that
it is only now realizing that things of  sixty to a nearly a hundred years
ago are "our contemporaries"?
     If one reads Hans Richter's 1963 Dada Art and Anti-Art or Abstract
Expressionist  painter Robert Motherwell's great anthology originally issue=
d
in the 1950's The Dada Painters and Poets, Dada poetry is treated very
seriously for American readers. ( Richter notes at one point  having Walter
Benjamin translate a Picabia poem for a journal that he edited.)  The great
Japanese poet Shinkichi Takahashi, known in English for his volumes of Zen
poetry and writings, was Japan's first Dadaist, wrote and published Dada
poetry and got himself arrested for Dada activities.The influence of Dada i=
n
his Zen poetry is very strong.  (There is a very fascinating book by a
Korean scholar on Tzara and Takahashi.)
The fact of the matter is that poetry of the Dadaists has played a huge rol=
e
around the world for a very long time--the works of Tzara, Hausmann,
Picabia, Schwitters and a poet as yet far too little known in the USA--the
artist Hans (Jean) Arp, who wrote in both French and German. Dada also
produced a vast body of Visual Poetry in every one of its locations globall=
y
and in New York, Picabia was closely associated with Stieglitz.  (His
journal 391 alludes to Steiglitz's 291.)  W C Williams hung out with the NY=
C
Dada crowd (and was particularly perturbed by the Baroness--herself a poet
of note).  Williams on the final pages of Spring and All includes a critiqu=
e
of Zaum, very far in advance of its much later "discovery" in the USA of th=
e
late 20th century.
       A great deal of the traditions which grew out of Dada and the
Futurisms have been for the most part marginalized in American poetry, and
when admitted into it, as with the example of Picabia, seen through a very
particular lens, in order in a sense to "torque" it into "the American
Tree."  One might say that this is the imperialist aspect of American
thought, that this being the land of invention, of course all things have
their true origin here, and if not, then they can be very quickly subsumed
into the narrative of the American Dream, Manifest Destiny and be included
in some antholgies alongside American "masters."
       Fellini said of his Satyricon:  "It is a science fiction film set in
the past."  This is an excellent way to describe some of the possibilities
opened up in examining this way of thinking.
      In the tape-essay "Renga and the new Sentence,"  Tosa Motokiyu, Ojiu
Norinaga and Okura Kyojin discuss and demonstrate that  Silliman's "New
Sentence" has actually been present and functioning for four centuries in
Japanese Renga, which in its 20th  century experimentations has moved even
further than its American counterpart, especially in concerns with single
author ownership of texts, an ideological construction firmly embedded in
the "private enterprise" emphasis of American capitalism. The tape-essay
both undercuts the "originality" of the New Sentence and at the same time
lends a kind of added stature to it by virtue of its being joined with  a
tradition it was unaware of.  It can still, in a way, lay claim to being
something of "an American original" by virtue of this happenstance, and
hence underscore the prescience of its author.  In a funny way, a person
could even "torque" the situation and claim that  the American is revealing
to the Japanese what they did not know that they had been doing all along,
just as poor Picabia never knew at all what he was up to, and now "we" do.
       At the time (1992) this tape-essay appeared in Aerial, the three
discussants were known as the translator-editors of the Japanese poet Araki
Yasusda.  Today, Yasusada having emerged as the fiction he "really" is,
Motokiyu is the pseudonym of the late person averred to be the "author."
Who the other two discussants "really" are--or-were--or will be--as with
Motokiyu, becomes unmoored from single authorship identity--and drifts into
the Poe-eque regions hovering between the living and the dead, floating
among the Real and the Unreal, among identities actual, pseudonymous and
anonymous, ghost written and posthumous.
       These multiplicities of hyper authors can be understood I think not
only as a critique of "authorship" and "authority," but of reading as well.
Note again the authors chosen to write the blurbs introducing Picabia and
mentioned in the review.  Reading these names and what they write and are
(presumed to be)  associated with in the reader's mind, one is guided
already into a certain way of reading Picabia, a frame within which to view
his techniques and formal qualities.  Already the poet is being "set up" fo=
r
a certain kind of reception and as it were being taken possesion of--"one o=
f
OUR contemporaries."
        That a critique of authorship leads to one of reading is one of the
myriad fascinating ideas put forth in Borges' story "Pierre Menard."  The
story opens with a critique of a catalogue of the works of Menard, leading
to the discussion of his most important but missing text, his exact, yet
superior, word for word writing of a few chapters of Don Quixote.  Menard's
labors are immense, his drafts thousands of torn up pages.  Yet the little
he produces, while seemingly the futile word for word reproduction of the
original. takes on added qualities not possesed by Cervantes' text.
Demonstrating how greatly the text written by Menard differs from that of
Cervantes, Borges' narrator quotes a passage which he says is "a mere
rhetorical eulogy" by "the ingenious layman" Cervantes, but, when written
by  Menard, coming after William James in time, "does not define history  a=
s
an investigation of reality, but its origin," and whose "final clauses are
shamelessly pragmatic."
      Borges' narrator also notes the contrast ins styles between the 20the
century Frenchman writing in 17th century Spanish (it "suffers a certain
affectation") and that of the 17th Century Spaniard "who handles easily the
ordinary Spanish of his time."
          In short, what might at first have appeared to be a very confinin=
g
exercise opens instead on a radically new adventure.
     "Menard (perhaps without wishing to) has enriched, by means of a new
technique, the hesitant and rudimentary art of reading:  the technique, wit=
h
its infinite applications, urges us to run through the Odyssey as if it wer=
e
written after the Aeneid . . . .This technique would fill the dullest of
books with adventure.  Would not the attributing of The Imitation of Christ
to Louis-Ferdinand Celine or James Joyce be a sufficient renovation of its
tenuous spiritual counsels?"
      In this way, one can claim that Picabia is really "one of us"--becaus=
e
he seems to fit in with dicta of the time by "one of us."  (That is, if we
read him via torque.) Yet what this does is "fill the dullest of books with
adventure"--that is, the dull book of all the vast decades and countries of
poets who have been studiously ignored , and when "discovered," are found t=
o
be surprisingly like what "we" have known about al the time.
      "Torque" is an example of this.  I recall reading an old essay of
Bernstein's in which he also uses a car associated word--"souped up" for a
somewhat similar purpose, of adding power to a word, a phrase, a line,
sentence, etc.  This kind of "gear head" talk fits in with the  manly phras=
e
"muscular prose" which crops up so very often among American male writers.
(Including Pound and Bernstein.)  It also follows in a line of American
poets who made analogies of writing and driving--Creeley in the Introductio=
n
to Naked Poetry, Kerouac ("Writing is silent meditation going a 100 miles
per hour," and Neal Cassady as the ultimate torquer), and W.C. Williams,
halting his car at the train crossing and using the time to write what he i=
s
seingo n his doctor's rounds.
         Yet the origin of the automotive fetish is to be found in the firs=
t
manifesto of modernism, Marinetti's 1909 "Founding and Manifesto of
Futurism."  Amazingly enough, Marinetti's machine is not simply a mechanica=
l
device, but also the predatory machine par excellence, the celebrated
companion of Lautreamont's Maldoror and haunter of Hollywood beaches:

"They thought it (the car) was dead, my beautiful shark, but a caress from
me was enough to revive it:  and there it was, alive again, running on its
powerful fins!."

    (Marinetti in 1909 by means of Futurist speeds seeing already the fins
of Fifties American cars driven at Cassady warp speeds--)

       Reading of Picabia's later work in which he is doing his reworkings
of Nietzsche's texts--is he not moving into the realms of Borges' Menard, o=
f
Motokiyu's Yasusada and friends in the 1930's writing 1980's American poetr=
y
in a tradition already four hundred years old, and claimed to be
specifically influenced by a Jack Spicer then aged 12?

      In early twentieth century western modernism there is the search for
an "outside" to contact for an influx of the "other," of the "new," of the
"unknown,."  Kandinsky turned to the study of the art of children Picasso
and others to the art of Africa, to the incorporation of outside elements
into a painting and poem by means of collage, the importing of techniques
and effects from telegraph, radio, cinema, x-rays, photogrpahy, aerial
photography.  The shapes and sizes of post cards became elements in
structuring poems such as Apollinaire's calligrammes.  The extreme brevity
of Ungaretti's poetry written in between gun fire and artillery blasts.  Th=
e
rapid disintegration of language from Futurist shatteings of syntax and
abandonment of punctuations to the chance drawings of words from a hat of
Dada.  And from there to using the letter as an element (Hausmann,
Schwitters).  Kruchonyhk turned to the Pentcoastal speaking in tongues for
inspiration in the founding of Zaum.  And after Prinzhorn's work on The Art
of the Mentally Ill appeared in 1922, there are the first  importings of th=
e
works ft the clinical "outsider," into serious consideration in art and
poetry.
       By contrast, one does not find such a turning in most American poetr=
y
to an outside.  It's very interesting that Gertrude Stein's example has
attained such a (forgive me) huge presence in American poetics,as some
aspects of her work exemplify a turning to an extreme focus on a private
language in a privatized sphere, where the Author in a sense reigns supreme=
.
      I don't recall in which book, but Stein remarks that one of the
reasons she lived in Paris was that this way she would not be hearing daily
the english language.  (Well--what about Alice and all the visitors?)   Wha=
t
she meant was that to be in an environment where English was seldom and
selectively heard, in her writing the only voice she really was hearing was
her own.  It is not that speech and voice vanish--she did write palys and
operas after all--it is that writing can be purified of any sounds other
than what she is able to have complete control of through this intense
listening only to oneself.  The privateness of language becomes in many
works the "subject" so to speak--it is both the subject that writes and the
subject of which it writes.  The extreme density of a text like "Stanzas in
Meditation," for example, is a kind of collapse of matter on its way to
being something approaching a black hole.  The private and its
privatization of a literary landscape, a geography, a history, create a
topology of seemingly impenetrable surfaces.  The "isolationism" associated
with many traditions of American thought manifests as this outward opacity
of an extremely self-involved private language.
     This is only one aspect of Stein's writing, to be sure, but is one tha=
t
has a lot of influence and cachet. In a way, it is in the tradition of a
Whitman, a "Song of Myself" and (my) " "Body Electric" channeled into
"material words" rather than worlds, cosmos.  The words though, have become
the sole property of Gertrude Stein, her private language.  It is still, fo=
r
all the community of friends and celebrity, the American individualist who
is the Author and Owner supreme.
       One reads that Picabia is like a contemporary.  Might one not read
this the other way round--and think--oh my God!!--we are only now reaching
what Picabia was up to many millenia ago?  That via isolationism, selective
filtering of texts chosen to fit into the narrative which will culminate in
"our contemporeinity" being at the apex of all poetic accomplishments in th=
e
"avant" and "post avant, " that via all this, the world has none the less
gone on turning and poets producing astounding works and creating
innumerable innovations, smashing all manner of conventions and taboos,
while Americans have been busy with imperial Sentences of Death, Torture,
Security, Surveillance, Ethnic Cleansing and other favorite activities with
one hand and "radical" or "conservative" poetry debates on the other?
         For example, following Picabia's example, one could use his workin=
g
with Nietzsche's to turn around and use Picabia's own texts as the lens
through which to read, say, "one of our contemporaries."
     Or employ the method of the fictional Japanese and Menard--to use and
old text in the present as though written again now as a means by which to
examine works in the present, works in the past.
      This proliferates the means by which may make use, learn from,
investigate with texts not as something to be fitted in to the appointed
slot--but something which is welcomed in as a tool for opening up,
disordering, creating new arrangements, knocking over the applecart,
       In short--not to say, ah a welcome addition to the shelf of the
history of --the continued reflection of our singular radiance--
       Bu aha!--something --uncanny, alive--not yet caged in he zoo or
pinned in the insect collection in the poetry sections . . .

        I don't think anyone mentioned as yet among innovators and makers o=
f
invective and so forth Archilochus?  The inventor or the iambic pentameter,
of lyric poetry and of the mighty insult--one so vile that it caused the ma=
n
it was directed at to kill himself.  Also one of the greatest of comic
poets.  Mercenary solider, bastard son of an important person, poet
extraordinaire.
       Re the quote from Novalis that "Language is Delphi"--
        Heraclitus writes:  "The One whose Oracle is at Delphi neither
speaks nor conceals but give signs."
         Signs may be birds, rainbows, strange beings, a weird object.  For
Heraclitus it would seem that the Oracle does not use language.  This is
close to the understanding of "The Tao that can be named is not the Tao."
And also from Heraclitus:  "One cannot hide from that which never sets."










     This paradoxical aspect is examined in the Yasusada book Doubled
Flowering in the footnotes re "Renga and the New Sentence" and also in the
Borges story "Pierre Menard":

Shortly before Richard Rorty died, he wrote (I'm paraphrasing), Heidegger was the best Philosopher of the 20th century, but a political coward. I'm not so sure that's fair.

Spring 2008
New York City (venue TBC)


*****


"If every word spoken in New York City daily were somehow to materialize as a snowflake,
each day there would be a blizzard."

The words of Kenneth Goldsmith, described by Juliana Spahr as 'the world's leading
conceptual poet', and by himself as 'the most boring writer that has ever lived'. His
ideas are being brought to the screen by artist and director Simon Morris in a film to
premiere at the British Library in London on Friday 26th October. Christian Bök, one of
Canada's leading poets and the winner of the 2002 Griffin poetry prize, said: "Goldsmith
is our James Joyce for the 21st century."

'sucking on words' introduces 8000 of those daily words - a flurry of excitement as the
climates of conflict and admiration come together around Goldsmith's pioneering
conceptual poetics. Shot on location in Manhattan in February this year, 'sucking on
words' features interviews with the leading critics and poets Bruce Andrews, Barbara
Cole, and Robert Fitterman.

Goldsmith says: "I'm more interested in knowing language better in the way Warhol was
knowing image better by simply turning the camera on to it and letting it run."

And Simon Morris adds: "Goldsmith is turning the literary world on its head by
encouraging plagiarism and suggesting writers throw away existing notions of intellectual
property." As Goldsmith says: "We don't need the new sentence, the old sentence re-framed
is good enough."

Conceptual writing is the poetics of the moment. It fuses avant-garde impulses of the
twentieth century with technologies of the present. The material morphs between the web
and the printed page. It draws attention to the materiality of the word and the
conceptual nature of this type of literature - the writing is the idea and the idea is
the writing.

The lively conversations featured in the film are an ideal introduction to Goldsmith's
witty and provocative works, already regarded as hallmarks of 21st century literature. In
addition to debate and commentary, the film showcases readings from some of his most
notorious books: No.111 (found phrases ending in an 'r' rhyme and filtered alphabetically
by syllable count); Soliloquy (a transcription of every word Goldsmith spoke for a week);
Day (a retyping of one day's New York Times); Traffic (a day's worth of hourly traffic
bulletins); and The Weather (a year's worth of of radio weather bulletins).

In November 'sucking on words' will have its Scandinavian premiere at the Oslo
International Festival of Poetry. A screening is also taking place at Shandy Hall,
Coxwold, near York, on Saturday 27th October, supported by the Laurence Sterne Trust
where Goldsmith will be staying as poet-in-residence.

Simon Morris says: "Oslo will provide us with the opportunity to bring the film to a much
wider European audience, whereas Shandy Hall was where Laurence Sterne wrote his most
celebrated work, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. It's fitting that
one of the most famous contemporary avant-garde poets is to stay in the home of one of
the 18th century's most experimental writers."

Dear Steve Russell,

=20

Heidegger's book Poetry, Language, Thought has been for me a pivotal and =
enthralling, revelatory work that I have been reading and teaching for =
some decades now, and I feel that Heidegger is an intellectual giant and =
a gorgeous writer. But I have to say that he was a Nazi, and he did some =
very, very ugly, cowardly things-which just tells us that human beings =
are not to be simplified. Also, not all of that book is "late Heidegger" =
as you suggest; to be sure, "The Origin of the Work of Art" was written =
early in his career and then, I believe, revised repeatedly over a large =
number of years, but the basic ideas in the essay are there in the first =
published version. Anyway, I urge you to check out a recent essay on H =
in Jacket 32, "Cutting Poets to Size - Heidegger, H=F6lderlin, Rilke," =
written by Anthony Stephens, someone who seems to be quite knowledgeable =
and clear-eyed about this great philosopher: =

Subject: Poetry Language Thought/ Martin Heidegger

Has anyone read Heidegger's "Poetry Language Thought?" It's a beautiful =
book. It's late Heidegger, during, what he called "the turning." He no =
longer called what he did philosophy. He simply called it "thinking." =
Being there in German is Dasein. Dasein was Heidegger's dialogue with =
the world.
  =20
  As for his political stance, I only know that he was deeply suspicious =
of modernity. He was expelled from the University of Frieburg for =
refusing to censor Nietzsche anti/anti Semitic writings. Hannah Arent, =
his lover at one time, defended him to the end. Heidegger was in no way =
a proponent of racial theories of any type. & Heidegger, as far as his =
being duped by political bullshit,  is certainly not alone among major =
20th century artist & thinkers.=20

Thanks. I appreciate the info on Anthony Stephens. Although I didn't deliberately intend my post to be instructional ( not consciously ), it's become that. I think I was looking for others to help illuminate the Heidegger enigma. They have. Also, I'm glad I was able to voice my enthusiasm for Poetry Language Thought. Thumbs up for buffalo/edu.

Heidegger's book Poetry, Language, Thought has been for me a pivotal and enthralling, revelatory work that I have been reading and teaching for some decades now, and I feel that Heidegger is an intellectual giant and a gorgeous writer. But I have to say that he was a Nazi, and he did some very, very ugly, cowardly things-which just tells us that human beings are not to be simplified. Also, not all of that book is "late Heidegger" as you suggest; to be sure, "The Origin of the Work of Art" was written early in his career and then, I believe, revised repeatedly over a large number of years, but the basic ideas in the essay are there in the first published version. Anyway, I urge you to check out a recent essay on H in Jacket 32, "Cutting Poets to Size - Heidegger, Hölderlin, Rilke," written by Anthony Stephens, someone who seems to be quite knowledgeable and clear-eyed about this great philosopher: http://jacketmagazine.com/00/home.shtml.

Subject: Poetry Language Thought/ Martin Heidegger

Has anyone read Heidegger's "Poetry Language Thought?" It's a beautiful book. It's late Heidegger, during, what he called "the turning." He no longer called what he did philosophy. He simply called it "thinking." Being there in German is Dasein. Dasein was Heidegger's dialogue with the world.

As for his political stance, I only know that he was deeply suspicious of modernity. He was expelled from the University of Frieburg for refusing to censor Nietzsche anti/anti Semitic writings. Hannah Arent, his lover at one time, defended him to the end. Heidegger was in no way a proponent of racial theories of any type. & Heidegger, as far as his being duped by political bullshit, is certainly not alone among major 20th century artist & thinkers.

Hello, I'm Jesse, and you are afraid of me.  One, I am emotionally disabled;

you fear, as part of a community, outsiders looking in, unable to make
adequate classification.  Moreover, in poetry, as we poets are the original
artists and, hence, will be the first to go, we are afraid of outsiders
looking in.. best classify it fear of poetry, or as it is legitimately
called, schizophrenia.  Now, as ever, more than ever.

I've been reading quite a lot recently about connections between poetry and
schizophrenia, and not in a "people with schizophrenia who write poetry"
kind of way.

I'm curious about this.  I'm recently in the mental health profession and
have met many people with schizophrenia in the past year or so.  These
interactions have definitely had an impact on my poetry, but I've never used
the two as synonyms, as they seem to be at the end of this, nor do they seem
synonymous to me.

Maybe I just don't "get" the metaphor....  Maybe there's something else I'm
missing.  Can anyone help me with this?

Cheers,
Tracey

A very interesting book is James K. Lyons' Paul Celan and Martin Heidegger:
An Unresolved Conversation 1951-1970, which has some new and  intriguing
information and insights on Celan's poem of their first meeting,
"Todnauberg," among much , much else from documents, letters and Celan's
notes on the texts of Heidegger's he intently studied.
     The poet Rene Char, a leader and hero if the French Resistance, went to
meet Heidegger in the early 1950's.  Heraclitus and Heidegger both have a
deep influence in Char's work.
      Among contemporary American poets, Robert Grenier is a very great
admirer of Heidegger's work and has been profoundly influenced by him since
the early 1960's.
       From what little I have read of Heidegger, he is concerned in many
works with "What is called thinking" (the title of one of his books)--which
entails going back to the pre-Socratics and examining the roots meanings of
the Greek word  they use.  To find "what is called thinking" is to go back
to these sources--when and whence it it is first emerging.  An especially
interesting book in this regard is "Early Greek Thinkers" which consists of
four essays, each on  a single phrase, two of them from Heraclitus.
       I recall reading an essay many years ago by Heidegger re poetry which
was brilliant, beautiful--and then slowly began to turn into some sort of
mysticism re the land, soil, etc and relation with a folk, a people--which
since he is a German and with his history immediately one associates with
Naziism.  Yet it could also be thought of in terms of Nationalism of the
mystical kind, or religion, religion related, and ethnic  centered kinds
which occurs in  many countries still today.  Wherever this kind of thinking
exists, it leads to ethnic cleansing, apartheid, Balkanization,Walls.
           The question of language in relation with these aspects makes one
wonder about the ways language is used in the United States, first to
mobilize and justify the genocide of the American Indians, then to actively
support a slew of repressive and ethnic cleansing regimes around the world
through time to the present.

If I'm not mistaken, Pierre Joris posted earlier, or maybe that was a different Pierre. A play, something similar to Michael Frayn's Copenhagen, should be written about Heidegger's meeting with Celan. It's certainly as enigmatic as Heisenberg's last meeting with Bohr.
  I'll look for the Joris translation.

Robert Majzels <rmajzels@UCALGARY.CA> wrote:
  One way to appreciate Heidegger is perhaps to read him through
Emmanuel Levinas, who first introduced Heidegger to France, and then
thought through a critique of Heidegger's thought.

Clearly, to divorce Heidegger's politics from his philosophy is
impossible, not to say dangerous. Nor does picking and choosing
what's "useful" in Heidegger entirely solve the problem.

What Lévinas manages to do, I think, is to identify the essentialism
in Heidegger that makes the fascist turn possible, not to mention the
turning away from the face of the other, the plight of his
colleague's in Freiburg for example. And of course, Levinas does this
without simplistic rejection. He makes it possible to continue
thinking after Heidegger. (Also a few hours with Paul Celan's poems
(in the original German or the Pierre Joris translations) is a
helpful counterpoint.)

An interesting metaphor. And perhaps appropriate provided that schizophrenia
is the hearing of voices. I was going to add 'not your own' but then we get
into whether its multiple personality disorder or schizophrenia. If you read
George Bowering or Jack Spicer, you will come across the concept of
'dictation', essentially the 'funnelling' of your 'muse' onto the page
without active intervention on the poet's part. Something like the automatic
writing of the surrealists - Breton, Artaud, etc. So, in that sense, if we
are hearing a voice 'dictating' to us, then, yes, it is a very appropriate
metaphor.

Subject: Re: Fear and Relevance -- a prologue

I've been reading quite a lot recently about connections between poetry and
schizophrenia, and not in a "people with schizophrenia who write poetry"
kind of way.

I'm curious about this.  I'm recently in the mental health profession and
have met many people with schizophrenia in the past year or so.  These
interactions have definitely had an impact on my poetry, but I've never used
the two as synonyms, as they seem to be at the end of this, nor do they seem
synonymous to me.

Maybe I just don't "get" the metaphor....  Maybe there's something else I'm
missing.  Can anyone help me with this?

Cheers,
Tracey

Taken this discussion more broadly, if I may, the current bugaboo for =
poets,
or writers of any ilk, is the whole concept of political correctness. I =
find
that the effect of this has been to transfer censorship from society to =
the
individual and, because the individual is quite often in the dark as to =
what
will be considered across the line, a wide berth is given to otherwise
effective and necessary poetic inspiration. What does everyone else =
think?

One way to appreciate Heidegger is perhaps to read him through =20
Emmanuel Levinas, who first introduced Heidegger to France, and then =20
thought through a critique of Heidegger's thought.

Clearly, to divorce Heidegger's politics from his philosophy is =20
impossible, not to say dangerous. Nor does picking and choosing =20
what's "useful" in Heidegger entirely solve the problem.

What L=E9vinas manages to do, I think, is to identify the essentialism =20
in Heidegger that makes the fascist turn possible, not to mention the =20
turning away from the face of the other, the plight of his =20
colleague's in Freiburg for example. And of course, Levinas does this =20
without simplistic rejection. He makes it possible to continue =20
thinking after Heidegger. (Also a few hours with Paul Celan's poems =20
(in the original German or the Pierre Joris translations) is a =20
helpful counterpoint.)

Considering all that has been said here, and just having talked with the Will Alexander on the phone I wanted to add a few things about his current condition.

  Will is feeling well, ready to conquer the world from our talk, very happy from your support, and would like future support to go directly to us at the address below. Otherwise it may or may not make it too him. There is a problem with the San fran ADDRESS provided earlier.

  In last year he has supported a book of ours put out nearly 10 years back. We admire that and a while ago we made an arrangement to publish his next book of poems.

  Will Alexander has been an important author to us, not only in terms of us making his most important collection but those books that came after, like Doug and Lyn's Book, well known, but more importantly, letting his best work shine with us and those who know us.

  Until the end of November, half of the coverprice from his seminal book of poems, ABOVE THE HUMAN NERVE DOMAIN,  will be given directly to the Author to help out out with his current health problems.

  Unlike some other places, our non-profit will give a full 100% of donations directly to Will. No problems. No questions asked.

  We love you all

  Be well-- David Baratier

Thanks, John.

I've been thinking about this all night.  Of course, the "not your own" is
applicable to schizophrenia, as dissociative identity-- the "new" term for
multiple personality-- isn't necessarily about hearing voices that aren't
your own as much as disassociating from your self and taking on a completely
different personality and set of behaviors (think of Sybil, Eve, Rabbit),
which would have an entirely new and different meaning for poets.  The
auditory hallucinations that are commonly a part of schizophrenia ARE
hearing voices that aren't your own--among other things.

The issue I have with throwing these terms around is that I understand
the pain (and shame) that people experience in having schizophrenia, and my
concern relates to not wanting to show disrespect for people who are in pain
like that, particularly when there are many people who don't fully
understand the meaning of the term that they're using (and, decidedly, the
DSM changes so frequently that it's difficult to keep up with what terms
mean, etc.).  I understand Spicer's aliens using the furniture in his room
in order to speak through him, and I appreciate that metaphor (and that it
doesn't refer to schizophrenia).  And, I can appreciate a metaphor that
describes that urge that I have to write that sometimes doesn't feel like
myself, that sometimes feels outside myself ("alien"), that pulls me to my
notebook or keyboard and pours out of me.

However, I, personally, am uncomfortable using a term that is so socially
loaded and misunderstood so as to cause people who suffer from "real"
auditory and visual hallucinations (and paranoia) to feel isolated and
rejected.  (And, I write this as I sit at the hospital attempting to get
help for a patient who has been trying for years to live with her paranoia
but who is resigning herself to accept outside help, because she just can't
take it anymore-- even under these circumstances, she's not really ready to
accept what's happening with her).  I think about the people I come into
contact with regularly when I hear the terms poetry and schizophrenia used
nearly synonymously.  When in a social setting, I'm sure that not too many
poets would introduce themselves as "schizophrenic" (a term I am also loathe
to use, as there's so much more to a person than a mental health diagnosis)
because of the social reprecussions that would create.  Sit back and imagine
how someone you've recently met might react if you say, "Oh, and I'm
schizophrenic.  I have some books with me, if you want to look."  People
already have a difficult time reacting appropriately when told we're
poets....

I am a poet.  And, in a lot of ways, being a poet is complicated.  What
compels me to write poetry that doesn't happen with my brother or other
family members?  I don't know.  I know that I don't hear voices that
"command" it of me (and, I've never encountered someone with voices that
would command something like writing poetry-- from the way I understand it,
the voices ask for something else).

On some levels, I can understand the metaphor, but on many, I simply can't
accept it.  Maybe I'm too close to people in crisis, and I just want to pull
them in under my blanket and protect them.  To me, it's a convenient
metaphor in a lot of ways, but even in reflecting on Spicer's aliens, I see
it as different from what he described.  My muse is in me, and in many ways,
is a part of me.  My muse doesn't wish me harm, doesn't tell me I'd be
better off dead and give me ways to kill myself.  My muse doesn't tell me
that everyone is looking at me and laughing.  Nor does my muse tell me that
everyone hates me because I had my tarot cards read once eight years ago.
My muse seeks to help me identify with others, not to isolate me from
others.  My muse helps me to share in the human experience and give to that
experience.  This is not to say that all auditory hallucinations are exactly
like this, or that there aren't individuals who enjoy the company they
have.  Some are much kinder-- "helpful" seeming.  And, this is not to say
that there do not exist and have not existed people with schizophrenia who
are not poets (or painters, or sculptors, or other kinds of artists),
because we all know this isn't true.

I'm thankful for my interactions with people with schizophrenia, because as
I said in the previous email, my poetry has been affected by those
interactions (I've been affected in other ways, too, but this is about
poetry).  I've learned a lot about language and how to fit words and ideas
together in ways that were never available to me before.  I've learned that
there are "other" ways of presenting complex ideas on the page, just from
conversations with the people I've encountered.  I've learned to think
differently in some ways, because I've been granted new perspectives on the
mind and the way it produces thought.  I'm thankful for that, and I try to
be respectful of that.

I recognize that I've probably thought entirely too much about this (as I am
often accused of doing), but I thank you for the opportunity to clarify my
own difficulties with what I've been reading on here and in other places,
especially if you've made it this far in my rant!

Cheers,
Tracey

continuing the marriage-poem thread, here is a marriage-anniversary poem
by a contemporary Indian poet, Prabal Kumar Basu

Marriage Anniversary


Tomorrow is our marriage anniversary
Today is the eve of our annulment
Yet, we hadn't scheduled any festivities
For either of the two days

Slightly backdated, nagging anniversary, regulated
Surely you don't enjoy it anymore
Even I have recently overcome the shallow emotion
To reminisce, that special date

It's winter, on the eve of our anniversary
Let's go for a walk
For the last time let us walk together

I can feel the breath of concealed excitement
On the eve of our annulment
You tripped while walking by my side
I steadied you for the last time
You took away your hand cautiously
Somewhat frightened
You realise, this unwanted marriage anniversary thrust
      upon
Has no worth any more
Instead tonight let us
Speak of the forthcoming days
Actually some of these days, still
Secretly will belong exclusively to us.

A very interesting article as there is art that is returned as art, and
bones that are returned as bones to be properly buried--American Indian
bones returned from the Smithsonian for burial in Sacred grounds--but what
to do with body parts that are decorated, appear also as art?
      In Cambodia, the tour guides in the museums which are the preserved
torture prisons of the Pol Pot regime are the torturers, who every day
recount again, room by room, device by device, their activities of thirty
years ago.
        In Israel, a discussion was held on the possibility of, after the
"solution" to the Palestinian problem, having a Museum of the Palestinian,
or of  Palestinian Culture.  Would it be safe to have exhibits of dances and
crafts demonstrated by live Palestinians, or would actors or diorama figures
have to be employed?
         Since the invasion of Iraq, it is isn't just the museums which are
systenatically looted;  it is a huge business for some time now to
methodically remove layer by layer the strati of the archeological history
of the world's oldest civilization.  Farmers and townspeople unemployed
since the occupation have found steady work excavating their own history and
selling it by the shovel full by the hour at a minimum wage to sub
contractors of contractors who pay off others to have it transported
elsewhere.  This is not "looting," after all, but "providing employment to a
desperate population."
        Will the French debate open up similar ones over the multi-tattooed
body parts of American soldiers littering IED lined convoy routes?

i've been thinking about how to read heidegger, too, in light of his
political background and lousy treatment of arendt it seems to me that
he was sort of one of those terrible parents (or Republicans) who
lives an ugly cowardly life, as you say Burt, and then has to write a
book about how everyone should avoid the same mistakes as he made.
like don't get caught up with 'the they' and the dangerous sweep of
public opinion. and then after making arendt sneak around, all of this
talk about propriation (owning up to what you are) and the clearings
and houses and temples that he describes on the way to language that
are all disclosedly open.

not that that excuses him for kicking his own teacher out of the
university or any of his other awful actions, or tells us which parts
of his work to use or not use, but for me it's interesting to read him
for this strange connect-disconnect.

I would like to announce that my second chapbook, Little Fires, is now
available for pre-publication sales, with no shipping,  under "New Releases"
from www.finishinglinepress.com.



Little Fires was a finalist in the New Women's Voices Poetry Series, and is
being published as # 55 in the series.  "Event Horizon" a sonnet crown and
the centerpiece of Little Fires, was awarded third place in the 2007 Women
Who Write Poetry Award, Finalist status in the 2007 Rita Dove Poetry Award,
and garnered the Emerging Poet Award from the 2007 Southern Women Writers'
Conference.  Other poems have appeared in   From the Other World:  Poems in
Memory of James Wright, American Poetry Review,  Mid-American Poetry Review,
Vox, Caesura, Stimulus Respond, and many other journals and anthologies.




Blurbs:



"Christina Lovin declares that she wants to write poems in which she
immerses herself, "like a dog...  muzzle deep in the rot of flesh and hair
found in a far field." .She has ventured boldly, and with memorable lyrical
detail, into the dark fields of farms, physics, desecrated mountain tops,
and the fenceless expanse of her grievous imagination. Like the "false map
turtle" she studies for directions in her poem "False Map," Lovin leads her
reader courageously into the mortmain of her memory where the lives and
deaths of both maligned and celebrated creatures return to her with haunting
messages. "Little Fires" is a stunning second collection of poems."



---Chard deNiord,  Asleep in the Fire, Sharp Golden Thorn, Night Mowing,
What the Animals Teach Us.



" 'No one around me / mentioned the war today,' Christina Lovin writes, but
the war is ever-present in these poems..As each poem tolls with the clarity
of a summer morning, Lovin focuses, in a poem dated September 11, 2001, on
"this moment after the fall" to demonstrate how history consumes us, day by
day, little fire by little fire.. In this resplendent collection, Christina
Lovin's subtleties flare up with impressive and often startling immediacy."

Thanks, Tracy, for your response. And I did read it in its entirety. I can
certainly understand your sensitivity to the issue and the terms used what
with your being engaged in the helping profession particularly related to
these issues. And I'm glad that you mentioned that some poets are
schizophrenic as I have known a few. I'm not certain that I would agree with
your statement that the voices do not command poets to write as, at least
for me, it is difficult to ignore my muse when she is cooing.
You mention socially loaded terms. I think poets use socially loaded terms
all the time - very often without being conscious of them. For example, the
term 'monoculture' which I used in a poem and was told to 'show not say'. I
argued that, because of the iconic quality of this word, it was showing as
the word, because of the connotations attached to it by contemporary
society, had lifted itself out of the ordinary. And then there are the terms
which are individually loaded. For example, in writing a poem for a former
lover now friend regarding her childhood in an isolated part of Manitoba, I
used the word 'tamarack (which is a type of evergreen with feathery leaves
that fall each autumn), only to realize, after sharing the poem with her and
having a discussion of the role the tamarack had played in her childhood,
that the word 'tamarack' had exceeded the ordinary for her and had become an
icon of her existence.
But I certainly do understand your position on the terms 'schizophrenic',
etc. The difficult is that they serve such a useful existence as metaphors
for the poetic process and especially poetic inspiration. And you have not
suggested another in its stead that would be as serviceable.
There is also the fact that, hopefully, the poet has no intention of harm
when using the terms - which is not necessarily nor has ever been a sine quo
non for usage.

Thanks, John.

I've been thinking about this all night.  Of course, the "not your own" is
applicable to schizophrenia, as dissociative identity-- the "new" term for
multiple personality-- isn't necessarily about hearing voices that aren't
your own as much as disassociating from your self and taking on a completely
different personality and set of behaviors (think of Sybil, Eve, Rabbit),
which would have an entirely new and different meaning for poets.  The
auditory hallucinations that are commonly a part of schizophrenia ARE
hearing voices that aren't your own--among other things.

The issue I have with throwing these terms around is that I understand
the pain (and shame) that people experience in having schizophrenia, and my
concern relates to not wanting to show disrespect for people who are in pain
like that, particularly when there are many people who don't fully
understand the meaning of the term that they're using (and, decidedly, the
DSM changes so frequently that it's difficult to keep up with what terms
mean, etc.).  I understand Spicer's aliens using the furniture in his room
in order to speak through him, and I appreciate that metaphor (and that it
doesn't refer to schizophrenia).  And, I can appreciate a metaphor that
describes that urge that I have to write that sometimes doesn't feel like
myself, that sometimes feels outside myself ("alien"), that pulls me to my
notebook or keyboard and pours out of me.

However, I, personally, am uncomfortable using a term that is so socially
loaded and misunderstood so as to cause people who suffer from "real"
auditory and visual hallucinations (and paranoia) to feel isolated and
rejected.  (And, I write this as I sit at the hospital attempting to get
help for a patient who has been trying for years to live with her paranoia
but who is resigning herself to accept outside help, because she just can't
take it anymore-- even under these circumstances, she's not really ready to
accept what's happening with her).  I think about the people I come into
contact with regularly when I hear the terms poetry and schizophrenia used
nearly synonymously.  When in a social setting, I'm sure that not too many
poets would introduce themselves as "schizophrenic" (a term I am also loathe
to use, as there's so much more to a person than a mental health diagnosis)
because of the social reprecussions that would create.  Sit back and imagine
how someone you've recently met might react if you say, "Oh, and I'm
schizophrenic.  I have some books with me, if you want to look."  People
already have a difficult time reacting appropriately when told we're
poets....

I am a poet.  And, in a lot of ways, being a poet is complicated.  What
compels me to write poetry that doesn't happen with my brother or other
family members?  I don't know.  I know that I don't hear voices that
"command" it of me (and, I've never encountered someone with voices that
would command something like writing poetry-- from the way I understand it,
the voices ask for something else).

On some levels, I can understand the metaphor, but on many, I simply can't
accept it.  Maybe I'm too close to people in crisis, and I just want to pull
them in under my blanket and protect them.  To me, it's a convenient
metaphor in a lot of ways, but even in reflecting on Spicer's aliens, I see
it as different from what he described.  My muse is in me, and in many ways,
is a part of me.  My muse doesn't wish me harm, doesn't tell me I'd be
better off dead and give me ways to kill myself.  My muse doesn't tell me
that everyone is looking at me and laughing.  Nor does my muse tell me that
everyone hates me because I had my tarot cards read once eight years ago.
My muse seeks to help me identify with others, not to isolate me from
others.  My muse helps me to share in the human experience and give to that
experience.  This is not to say that all auditory hallucinations are exactly
like this, or that there aren't individuals who enjoy the company they
have.  Some are much kinder-- "helpful" seeming.  And, this is not to say
that there do not exist and have not existed people with schizophrenia who
are not poets (or painters, or sculptors, or other kinds of artists),
because we all know this isn't true.

I'm thankful for my interactions with people with schizophrenia, because as
I said in the previous email, my poetry has been affected by those
interactions (I've been affected in other ways, too, but this is about
poetry).  I've learned a lot about language and how to fit words and ideas
together in ways that were never available to me before.  I've learned that
there are "other" ways of presenting complex ideas on the page, just from
conversations with the people I've encountered.  I've learned to think
differently in some ways, because I've been granted new perspectives on the
mind and the way it produces thought.  I'm thankful for that, and I try to
be respectful of that.

I recognize that I've probably thought entirely too much about this (as I am
often accused of doing), but I thank you for the opportunity to clarify my
own difficulties with what I've been reading on here and in other places,
especially if you've made it this far in my rant!

Cheers,
Tracey

dear tracey, thanks so much for this.  there is schizophrenia in my
family, and while i agree that a very different and amazing appreciation
of meaning/words comes along with it, the terribly harsh parts of it,
including the social isolation, are nothing to speak lightly of.  all
best, gabe

**Talisman House
Talisman, one of the most respected and productive small press publishers
dealing in literary works, was founded in 1988. The press began with the
publication of the biannual journal, Talisman, described in MultiCultural
Review as =B3kaleidoscopic =8A eclectic =8A fermenting with a thousand tongues=B2
and in Small Press as =B3a serious forum for the best of American poetry and
poetics.=B2
=20
The journal=B9s success led to the publication of books, beginning with
National Book Award winner William Bronk=B9s The Mild Day and Alice Notley=B9s
Selected Poems in 1993. Distinguished works in poetry, fiction, theory, and
criticism followed. Among the earliest works published were Jack Spicer=B9s
novel The Tower of Babel, which some thought he had never completed but
which was accidentally discovered in the early 1990s in a trunk of his
manuscripts. Other important works included Leslie Scalapino=B9s novel The
Return of Painting, Gustaf Sobin=B9s selected poems, and new books by Joel
Lewis, Michael Heller, John High, Paul Hoover, Stephen Jonas, Gerrit
Lansing, Timothy Liu, Samuel Menashe, Alice Notley, Geoffrey O=B9Brien,
Douglas Oliver, Simon Pettet, Leslie Scalapino, Andrew Schelling, and
Leonard Schwartz.
=20
Among the many books scheduled for publication this fall and early next yea=
r
are The Collected Poems of Gustaf Sobin; The Collected Poems of William
Bronk; Zhang Er=B9s anthology of contemporary Chinese Poetry, Another Kind of
Nation; and new books by Joel Lewis, Stephen Paul Miller, and Serge
Gavronsky. Talisman will also be publishing Figen Bingul=B9s translation of
Summer=B9s End by Adalet Agaoglu, who is widely regarded as one of the major
novelists of our time.

nice to see a small press fire up again...


On Dec. 1, 2007, Chiron Review will re-open for submissions, with an eye
toward a spring issue, March 20, 2008. Writers are invited to send up to six
poems, or one short-story. We're also open to reviews, interviews, black and
white art and photography, and essays of interest to writers and the small
press literary community.

I hope CR readers and writers will forgive me for shutting down and then
starting back up again. Chiron Review has always flown along on a wing and a
prayer, had its delays and hiatuses, stopping and starting as finances and
circumstances dictated (but always done right by subscribers and
contributors). I do apologize for the roller coaster ride and can't really
offer any guarantees for the future. Chiron Review readers and writers have
always gone above and beyond the call of duty to support the magazine and to
spread the word. I hope you will continue that tradition now.

On Dec. 1, 2007, snail-mail submissions with name and complete mailing
address on every poem (and front page of prose) should be sent, with SASE to
Chiron Review, 522 E. South Ave., St. John, KS 67576-2212.

On Dec. 1, 2007, or after, e-mail submissions should be sent to
ChironSubmissions@hotmail.com. Put all poems in the e-mail text or as ONE
attachment, not one attachment for each poem, please. Floppy disk and CD
submissions in Rich Text Format (RTF) are also welcome. Photographs and art
may only be submitted via snail-mail. PLEASE: Name and complete mailing
address must accompany all electronic submissions.

I'd also like to exchange subscriptions with other magazines and receive
review copies of small press books and magazines for review and listing in
my "News, Etc." column. They can be sent to the address above.

Subscriptions and donations are welcome anytime, and will help me get Chiron
Review back off the ground. A one-year/four issue subscription is $16. The
"Triple S" discount is offered to Seniors, Students and Starving Artists.
Don't be afraid to ask about it. And of course, those who are able and wish
to provide more support than $16 a year are most welcome to do so. I can
accept payment via Paypal: poetry_man61@hotmail.com. Please send me an
e-mail if you make a payment this way.

John Wieners heard voices and was visited by the Virgin Mary. My =
impression, from reading his wilder stuff, like parts of Behind the =
State Capitol, and from my few but treasured conversations with him, is =
of a greater than usual access to an incredibly fertile source of =
association, the absence of the barrier that normally separates the =
mundane world from the world of unlimited possibilities, which in his =
case was obviously a world saturated with language. But, and this is the =
point, although he could not always control that world or his access to =
it, he knew how to command spectacularly the material he drew from it, =
because on and off the drugs and in and out of hospitals, he had spent =
decades perfecting his craft.

Tending, Tuning

http://www.asondheim.org/tuning4.jpg

If I tune 880 kHz on a contemporary radio, it's simple; everything is in
place and linear. 880 clearly falls between 870 and 890. If the radio is
analog, a dial is turned until the station comes in. If the radio is
digital, either up and down buttons are used or the number is entered
directly. With analog, one might tune to other, fainter, pirate signals -
perhaps something on 882, for example. With inexpensive digital radios,
these signals are skipped over.

Older crystal radios and superheterodynes worked otherwise. A crystal
radio becomes a complex hit-and-miss system of digital taps and analog
dials, creating resonance when and where a desired audible signal occurs.
The taps and dials are tending, and hunting for a signal involves a
difficult but rewarding search. I present four images of an early 1920s
crystal radio with a honeycomb coil with three tap systems connected in
series to a variometer and antenna. There are two dials, one for the
condenser in the crystal radio itself, and the other for the variable
inductor of the variometer. Here is a description from the early 1920s of
the tuning process:

"Having adjusted the crystal detector to a sensitive point, the next thing
is to adjust the switches on the coil tube P (primary), the switch on the
coil tube S (secondary) and also the variable condenser C so that the ap-
paratus will be in 'resonance' with the transmitting station.

Set the primary switch N on contact point 1 and while keeping it in this
position move the other primary switch O over all of its contacts, stop-
ping a moment at each one.

Care should be taken to see that the ends of the switch arms are not al-
lowed to rest so that they will touch more than one contact point at a
time.

If no signals are heard, set the switch arm N on contact point 2 and again
move the switch arm O over all of its contents. Proceed in this manner un-
til the transmitting station is heard. This is called 'tuning' the primary
circuit.

The tuning of the secondary circuit is the next operation. Set the secon-
dary switch Z on contact point I and turn the knob of the variable conden-
ser C so that the pointer moves over the entire scale.

If no signals are heard, set the switch 2 on contact point 2 and again
turn the knob of the variable condenser so that the pointer movers over
the entire scale.

Proceed in this manner until the signals are loudest, being careful to see
that the ends of the switch arms touch only one contact point at a time.

Next slide the coil tube S (secondary) in and out of the coil tube P (pri-
mary) until the signals are made as loud as possible. This operation is
called changing the 'coupling.' When the coupling which gives the loudest
signal has been secured, it may be necessary to readjust slightly the
position of the switch arm ), the position of the movable coil tube S and
the 'setting' of the variable condenser C.

The receiving set is now in resonance with the transmitting station. It is
possible to change the position of one or more of the switch arms, the
position of the movable coil tube and the setting of the variable conden-
ser in such a manner that the set will still be in resonance with the same
transmitting station, In other words, there are different combinations of
adjustments which will tune the set so that it will respond to signals
from the same transmitting station.

The best adjustment is that which reduces the signals from undesired sta-
tions to a minimum and still permits the desired transmitting station to
be heard. This is accomplished by decreasing the coupling (drawing coil
tube S farther out of coil tube P) and again tuning with the switch arm O
and the variable condenser C. This may also weaken the signals from the
desired transmitting station but it will weaken the signals from the unde-
sired station to a greater extent, provided that the transmitting station
which it is desired to hear has a wave frequency which is not exactly the
same as that of the other stations. This feature is called 'selectivity.'"
(from Henry Smith Williams, Practical Radio, Funk & Wagnalls, 1922-24.)

The description is of a three-tapped set with a loose coupler; in the
photographs, the variometer replaces the loose coupler, and tuning is done
with a knob. Note that what is described is a delicate set of checks and
balances; to move away from an interfering station may require all of the
tuning elements to be readjusted (trust me, in practice, it usually does).
Another difference - with the honeycomb coil I'm using, sometimes the best
results occur when the contact is touch two taps simultaneously.

I think of this as tending, much as playing a non-electronic instrument
(and some electronic instruments for that matter) is a tending - much as
dance is a tending of the body, song a tending of the voice, among other
elements. A tending is most often non-linear; every adjustment resonates
with every other, affects every other. I think this is the way the world
was, and is, just as weather is the result of innumerable factors, each of
which affects the others, often in unpredictable, chaotic ways. While I've
written about this before, I haven't had the opportunity, until recently,
to actually operate a complete older crystal radio. The act of tending
seems to be, by its very nature, an act of poetics - there is art in it,
tricks to be learned, but few shortcuts. I can "feel" the inductance as
the coils are switched and turned, and turning/tuning the condenser
"feels" different again. This has to do, technically, with resonant peaks
and valleys, but the sense is otherwise, that of tending plants or a small
world with current flowing through it, gated by crystal or diode, narrowed
by the rest of it (with a crystal set, of course, there are no volume
controls or on/off switches; it runs on the energy of the signal itself).

Somewhere here, there's a phenomenology of operating in relation to tend-
ing, analog in relation to digital, caring and justice in relation to law
and order, muscle knowledge/memory to traditional "intellect," touch/taste
to perception/hearing, and tacit/external knowledges to internal thought.
But this has gone on for too long, and the direction, aegis, of such a
phenomenology might be clear enough from my other work as well.

(Note: The two images of the crystal radio interior illustrate the coil
and condensor, which has both coarse and fine tuning. I'm using bubble
wrap to hold the coil in place to avoid strain on the original solder

In the work of Ted Greenwald, tradition is never more than an extension of
innovation, history never more than an engagement with the present, the
commonplace never more than an extension of the extraordinary.

Building on New York's remarkable history of painter and poet
collaborations, this striking art and text project features nearly thirty
paintings and poems by two seasoned artists. Because his work always
involves linguistic and formal invention, Ted Greenwald has often been
associated with the Language Writers, but he is unmistakably a New York poe=
t
and even, given his street-wise sensibility and his long association with
visual art and artists, a New York School poet.

Typeset and designed by Kyle Schlesinger, the dimensions of the images are
true to the original works of art. 250 copies from SPD or Cuneiform at $20 =
a
pop. Limited edition hardcover are signed by the painter and poet,
handbound, and printed on pure cotton rag paper in full colour. Edition of
20 available direct from Cuneiform at $75 a pop (order before the end of th=
e
month and it=B9s yours for $50, postage included). Deluxe hardcover edition i=
s
housed in a slipcase and includes a small book handwritten by the author.
Edition of 10 (only #1 and  #2 remain) available direct from Cuneiform at
$300 a pop.

Book party at Sugar in NYC scheduled for January.

If anybody remembers Susan Sontag's book about cancer as a metaphor. She
violently objects to that kind of use. There is a big difference in the
meaning for those who know or suffer from the word literally and those who
are using it metaphorically. Of course, this kind of use goes on all the
time, for instance, "there is a cancer in your presidency," John Dean saying
it to Richard Nixon.

References to creative acts have always been associated with aberrant
behavior of one kind or another: "to make of (give to) airy nothings a local
habitation and a name." Is that not the same as hearing voices. The poet
imagines them real; the poet makes them real -making others hear the same
voices. Nietche's conception of beyond good and evil, also, -that the hero
or poet are beyond social realities/restrictions- is that not also a kind of
imagining?

I do not think the parallel between the poet and the schizophrenic is a
comparison of suffering, but of privilege. When we point to a similarity
between the schizophrenic and the poet, whom are we privileging, the former
or the latter? Are we saying that the schizophrenic possesses a certain
divine quality or that the poet possesses the privilege of not following
social rules followed by other mortals?

Ciao,

To be held at the American University of Sharjah, UAE




Introduction=20

English today has become the lingua franca of an increasingly interdependen=
t and globalized world.  In almost every part of the world, including the A=
rabian Gulf region, the English language is often becoming the first choice=
 for communication among linguistically and culturally diverse people. The =
number of current and future users of English in the world is mounting, and=
 according to recent estimates, Non native speakers of English have surpass=
ed the number of native English speakers. Indeed, recent research in TESOL =
and its subfields have started paying more attention to NNS/NNS interaction=
s in English, and whether the English speaker=92s norms should be viewed as=
 the standard.  However, much research is still needed to address the issue=
 of teaching English as a global or international language.  This conferenc=
e will provide a forum for scholarly discussion of TESOL within the context=
 of globalization. =20

ADVANCE WORDS from prominent poets attest  to Prau's power and beauty:

Jean Vengua is a poet of the typo, the  missed step, the happy and unhappy=20
accident; in short, she is a poet of  linguistic and global migration.  Prau=
=20
moves its reader from the  Philippines to the Bay Area and back, "always min=
ing=20
past present tenses."   In her aptly titled prose poem, "Momentum," Vengua=20
links Gustav Mahler, her  mother, Buffalo Soldiers, Marie Curie, Roberto Mat=
ta,=20
and Jose Rizal in a dance  of histories real and imagined.  The momentum of=20=
her=20
writing brings  together what is otherwise ripped asunder: "That is to make=20
beautiful where the  dissonance begins to tear."
--Susan M. Schultz, Editor of Tinfish  Press

Prau sets forth on its courageous voyage through time  and spirit with a=20

sails=20
us  through the worlds of Mahler, Marie Curie, Moses  Browning (who invented=

H -=20
Bomb, Matta, the polymath Rizal, Dapitan and the migratory  routes of her=20
father's wandering ukulele. Vengua's   poems   gently yet firmly navigate us=
 =20
towards yet  to be explored spheres of  psychological and lyrical revelation=
=20
where "by turns and in rounds we are angry,  indifferent and in love" and "w=
ithout=20
ghosts, the obscurity of night becomes  real." This is page-turner, addictiv=

poetry that never falters in its gaze  at   the integrity of dream and the=20
dream of integrity.
--Nick  Piombino, author of Fait Accompli


At last, this pioneer of the  literary blog scene who I have followed throug=
h=20
cyberspace since the nineties  has a book of poetry that I can take home wit=
h=20
me! Vengua's poetry delves into  the very nature of culture and custom. An=20
ordinary postage stamp triggers a  multi-racial dilemma. A personal memento=20

Arab women stereotypes challenged in pioneering new book by AUS professor
http://www.aus.edu/media/news/show_article.php?Article=3D444



An exciting anthology of pioneering essays challenging the prevailing stere=
otypes of Middle Eastern women through the analysis of first-person writing=
 has just been published in the United States by Syracuse University Press.=
 Entitled Arab Women=92s Lives Retold: Exploring Identity through Writing, =
the book has been edited by Dr. Nawar Al-Hassan Golley, Associate Professor=
 and Head of the Department of Arabic Studies at American University of Sha=
rjah (AUS).

Examining late 20th-century autobiographical writing by Arab women novelist=
s, poets and artists, the anthology explores the ways in which Arab women h=
ave portrayed and created their identities within differing social environm=
ents. Even as the collection dismantles standard notions of Arab female sub=
servience, the works presented go well beyond the confines of those traditi=
onal boundaries.=20

The book, which took two years to compile and edit, explores the many route=
s Arab women writers have taken to speak to each other, to their readers an=
d to the world at large. Drawing from a rich body of literature, the essays=
 collectively attest to the surprisingly lively and committed roles Arab wo=
men play in varied geographic regions, at home and abroad. The recent writi=
ngs assess how the interplay between individual, private, ethnic identity a=
nd the collective, public, global world of politics has impacted Arab women=
=92s rights.

=93From this book, it can be seen that the metaphoric and uncharacteristic =
unveiling by Arab women writers, undertaken both to refute the West=92s vie=
w of them as passive victims and to expose the discrimination within their =
own societies, often at the risk of censorship and punishment, is a courage=
ous act that reveals Arab women writers to be contributors to the future of=
 their societies,=94 explained Dr. Al-Hassan Golley, who apart from editing=
 the anthology has two contributions in the collection.

The book is available online at Amazon.com and from the website of Syracuse=
 University Press.

How do we honor the dead?
  Not too long ago, Disney proposed opening a Civil War theme park in Virginia. This caught the attention of William Styron. What you describe happening in Iraq is obscene. Ditto Cambodian tour guides & Palestianian mimes.

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote:
  A very interesting article as there is art that is returned as art, and
bones that are returned as bones to be properly buried--American Indian
bones returned from the Smithsonian for burial in Sacred grounds--but what
to do with body parts that are decorated, appear also as art?
In Cambodia, the tour guides in the museums which are the preserved
torture prisons of the Pol Pot regime are the torturers, who every day
recount again, room by room, device by device, their activities of thirty
years ago.
In Israel, a discussion was held on the possibility of, after the
"solution" to the Palestinian problem, having a Museum of the Palestinian,
or of Palestinian Culture. Would it be safe to have exhibits of dances and
crafts demonstrated by live Palestinians, or would actors or diorama figures
have to be employed?
Since the invasion of Iraq, it is isn't just the museums which are
systenatically looted; it is a huge business for some time now to
methodically remove layer by layer the strati of the archeological history
of the world's oldest civilization. Farmers and townspeople unemployed
since the occupation have found steady work excavating their own history and
selling it by the shovel full by the hour at a minimum wage to sub
contractors of contractors who pay off others to have it transported
elsewhere. This is not "looting," after all, but "providing employment to a
desperate population."
Will the French debate open up similar ones over the multi-tattooed
body parts of American soldiers littering IED lined convoy routes?

This is really apples and oranges, Murat. Cancer as metaphor is
actually pretty accurate--there's a destructive, madly replicating
thing in the body politic. The use of schizophrenia as metaphor, on
the other hand, is based on an inaccurate folk definition.

We all (or mostly all) have different voices within us, probably an
internalization of the imaginary friend of childhood. But
schizophrenics, unlike non-schizophrenic poets, often don't have the
privilege of following the social rules of other mortals. As Tracey
and Gabe have pointed out, that's a pretty important privilege.

I tend to think of poets as the shamans of our society - the gatherers and
preservers of the folklore and history of our tribes. As with all shamans
throughout history, recorded and unrecorded, we are all outcasts living on
the fringes of society. Al Purdy failed at everything until he discovered,
in his mid-forties, that he was a poet. Di Brandt and Patrick Friesen had to
leave their respective Mennonite communities before their voices could be
heard - they were shunned in the process. bill bissett, who Jack Kerouac
named in 1966, in an interview with Paris Review, as the only North American
poet worth listening to, has been living on the fringes of Vancouver since
the 1960s developing his concrete and sound poetry - poverty stricken and
addicted to drugs which has never stopped him from touring the world to
recite his poetry. We poets have been set apart perhaps, like shamans in all
lands and in all times, we are considered to have gathered too much power -
the power of the word - and there is still within everyone a fear of those
who have exhibited a mastery over words. So, do we have a choice as to
whether or not, and more often the latter, we follow the social rules of
other mortals? I ask this question because I don't think we do - either have
a choice or follow the rules. So perhaps poets are closer to being
schizophrenic than we might believe. Those of us who have not been
categorized as such in a medical sense perhaps have learned to channel those
tendencies to the page.

This is really apples and oranges, Murat. Cancer as metaphor is
actually pretty accurate--there's a destructive, madly replicating
thing in the body politic. The use of schizophrenia as metaphor, on
the other hand, is based on an inaccurate folk definition.

We all (or mostly all) have different voices within us, probably an
internalization of the imaginary friend of childhood. But
schizophrenics, unlike non-schizophrenic poets, often don't have the
privilege of following the social rules of other mortals. As Tracey
and Gabe have pointed out, that's a pretty important privilege.

Dear all:

As many of you know, there is a chain e-mail regarding recipes
currently making the rounds.  I've encountered it previously through
non-poets, and now a whopping six or seven times over the course of
the past year from poets (more times from nonpoets).  Now, perhaps
this is my own fault, as I have been publishing collages of cookbook
pages taken from the University of Michigan online archive.

What say we 1) put out a poet's cookbook, either in print or on a
blog, waiving the "easy ingredients" clause, in the vein of Ronald
Johnson or of Alice B. Toklas, or Emily Dickinson, 2) stop sending the
chain e-mails.

All best,
Catherine Daly

Mark,

If I remember correctly, in Illness and Metaphor(?) S. Sontag was
questioning the moral validity of using sickness as metaphorical language
since it involved real suffering. I wonder if she wrote that book when she
discovered she had cancer.

Underlying her question, I think, there is a deep -though not spelled out-
questioning of the value of art. She does a similar thing when she questions
war paintings or war photography. David pointed us all out to the very
interesting and extended discussion of two photographs by Fenton of the
Crimean war in the New York Times blog. That discussion also was kicked off
with Sontag's assumption that a manipulation of the war scene by Fenton
occurred in the taking of that photograph. In other words, underlying the
usage of sickness or war language in relation to art has the issue of
authenticity, legitimacy or power, rather than merely accuracy (mimesis),
underlying it.

I was speculating rather than defending any specific point of view.

Ciao,

Murat

Have you priced *her* special ingredient lately? It's not quite, how do we
say, economically inclusive.

Please join us this Monday, October 29th for "The Letterpress in the
Mimeo Revolution," a lecture by Dr. Kyle Schlesinger. This talk will
take place at 12 noon in The Poetry Collection, 420 Capen.


 _Small Press in the Archive_Lecture Series dedicates itself to the
study of poetry outside the traditional literary historical plot. The
lectures in this series draw on materials in The Poetry Collection, at
SUNY Buffalo in order to explore community/discourse formations, the
status of ephemera and the making of genre, the conditions of literary
production, transatlantic cross-pollinations in and between specific
magazines, the careers of poets, the role of book art, and how the
little magazine functions in the making of the avant-garde.

This event is funded by the Mildred Lockwood Lacey Fund for Poetry/The
Poetry Collection and is free and open to the public.

Drawn Song


Bird song halved and extended.
So near the building, this one beautiful bird.

http://www.asondheim.org/drawnbird.mp3

Halved and lowered, the echo of the bird against brick and stone.
I haven't heard these sounds.
Organizing avatar video for a conference next week; the work is
translucent, neither deep-time nor anything more than surface.
I can't get anywhere beyond the surface.
If I do sex or violence I get a rise, at least something emotional.
Some talk about death, war, wounded avatars beneath the surface of the
prim-rosed sea.
If I don't, well then, there's always the dawn-drawn bird-cry, neither
falcon nor osprey, eagle or mountebank crow.
Settle for that rather than some avatar deep-protocol other.
At least you won't fall in love. All over again.

The problem with using cancer as a metaphor is in that the focus goes
to the disease itself and not to the way it is being treated for the
treatments are worse than the disease itself and we are distracted by
metaphors for the treatment is the biggest problem and the fact that
"progress" has not been made (in the least/ don't believe it) so using
cancer as a metaphor is just replicating a false illusion that the disease
is in the body when most of it exists within the fact that the egos which
preserve the practices which do not work/do not heal/ are set free through
this illusion while the cancer patients die.

Bobbi: I'm truly not committed to this or any other metaphor--they
mostly pass by without landing in consciousness after they've been
used a couple of times. And they're always of limited accuracy, as
one thing never is another. I don't think that its metaphoric use has
any impact at all on the treatment of real cancers, however, and I
doubt that anyone mistakes cancer-as-metaphor for the disease. At the
very least, most of us have more than ample experience of the real
thing, in our own bodies or in the bodies of people we love. But your
characterization of treatment sounds an awful lot like the workings
of the body-politic.

Try this:

If Saddam's regime was a cancer, its treatment has been worse than
the disease. The egomaniacs in charge have insisted on practices
which do not work/do not heal, while the patient dies.

But back to physical reality for a moment. According to medical
folklore, the greater the mortality rate of a particular disease the
weirder the doctors get. My experience with neurologists during a
long bout of epilepsy (which passed of its own accord) tends to
support this. One was loonier than the next, including a couple who
spoke of themselves in the third person. I remember one in
particular, Eli Goldensohn, head of the Neurological Institute at
Columbia Presbyterian, who was the perfect mad scientist of movies.
Maybe it's the despair that comes of being able to help such a small
percentage of patients that sends them around the bend or maybe they
were born that way or maybe only doctors who have a character
disorder that helps them compensate for relative powerlessness choose
to specialize in neurology. They were often simply wrong in their
statements. I was repeatedly told, for instance, that adult onset
seizures rarely go away, but I kept meeting people (tho only a
minority) who had had exactly that experience. The doctors believed
what they were saying, and they could back it up with unfortunately
very bad science--they really didn't know what happened to their
patients, as most who did recover spontaneously simply broke off
contact, and there was no long-term follow-up. I also read the
journals, where I encountered incredibly sloppy studies that failed
to account for the most obvious variables. The
treatment--antispasmodics of various kinds--for most people produce
bearable side-effects, but for perhaps 40% the side effects are
indeed worse than the disease (I was one of those), and I had the
sense that the doctors were treating the disease and not the patient.

The doctors were usually floundering in the dark. For most epileptics
they can demonstrate where a brain is misfiring but can find no
cause. But I never had reason to doubt that they wished they could do
better, if not for the patients as suffering humanity then at least
as experimental subjects. I think the same is true of oncologists,
most of whom really would like to have better, less destructive
treatments to offer, which is why they continue to experiment. Like
the rest of us, most oncologists are likely to have loved-ones who
have had cancer, and like all of us, the threat of cancer hangs over
their heads.

Hi all,

Here's the recipe for my super-deluxe elderflower cheesecake.  The only thing sweeter is my new book, Shy Green fields, just out from No Tell Books, copies of which can be found at lulu.com.

Hugh Behm-Steinberg


Elderflower Cheesecake


Crust


1 1/4 cups flour
1/4 cup Sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon elderflower jelly
1/2 cup sweet butter
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons St. Germain liqueur

Mix flour, sugar, salt, and elderflower jelly in the bowl of a food processor, pulse a couple times.  Add butter in pieces, then pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add yolk and St. Germain, pulse until a ball forms.  Press pastry dough over the bottom and up the sides of a nine inch spring-form pan.  Put the pan on a cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for 15 minutes, until dry but not brown.

Filling

30 ounces of ricotta cheese
6 ounces mascarpone cheese
4 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup St. Germain liqueur

Hello Alex,

anonymouse.org. I believe this works in both Pakistan and China, where
there is government censorship of google's blogspot system. It will also
work for people in countries, like the United States, who rely on
employers and ISPs to censor things.

I sometimes see people visiting rhubarb is susan via anonymouse, and it
makes me feel rather proud. Definitely be aware that both these countries
(Pakistan and China) have a sort of roaming censorship. Things go up,
things go down. Different IP addresses in the same country have different
restrictions, and I believe many proxies sort of play a wack-a-mole game.

The OpenNet initaitve (google it) has an enormous amount of detail on the
censorship of the internet in different countries, and may also be a good
point of reference.

Yours,

Simon

I should add (sorry for the posts here) that people need to be careful.
Some censorship works by simply blocking an IP address. Some censorship
works by content -- i.e., an IP address can be contacted, but the system
will block it from transmitting "banned" words like "Tiananmen", and
possibly record your attempt.

If you are worried about your web habits being monitored by a third party,
and in particular if you are worried about the *content* being monitored,
you need to make sure that the proxy you are using has rigorous
encryption. Searching for "encrypted web proxy" might turn up helpful
material.

This is true for users worried about government interception, but also
goes double for people accessing the web from a computer at their place of
work.

Hi all,

Here's the recipe for my super-deluxe elderflower cheesecake.  The only
thing sweeter is my new book, Shy Green fields, just out from No Tell Books,
copies of which can be found at lulu.com.

Hugh Behm-Steinberg


Elderflower Cheesecake


Crust


1 1/4 cups flour
1/4 cup Sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon elderflower jelly
1/2 cup sweet butter
1 egg yolk
2 tablespoons St. Germain liqueur

Mix flour, sugar, salt, and elderflower jelly in the bowl of a food
processor, pulse a couple times.  Add butter in pieces, then pulse until
mixture resembles coarse meal.  Add yolk and St. Germain, pulse until a ball
forms.  Press pastry dough over the bottom and up the sides of a nine inch
spring-form pan.  Put the pan on a cookie sheet and bake in a preheated 350
degree oven for 15 minutes, until dry but not brown.

Filling

30 ounces of ricotta cheese
6 ounces mascarpone cheese
4 eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/4 cup St. Germain liqueur
4 tablespoons elderflower jelly

Blend cheeses, eggs, sugar and flour in a biggish bowl.  Stir in St. Germain
and elderflower jelly.  Pour the filling into the crust, place the pan on a
cookie sheet and bake in a preheated oven at 325 degrees for an hour or
until a tester comes out clean.  Let cool, chill and serve.

Small Press Traffic is thrilled to present:


Kevin Killian & Joseph Lease

Friday, November 2, 2007
Timken Lecture Hall    7:30 p.m.
Refreshments will be served


Whenever Kevin Killian reads at SPT, it's its own kind of homecoming
and good things are sure to happen.   Killian is a poet, novelist,
critic and playwright whose works include a book of reviews Selected
Amazon Reviews (2006), a collection of poetry, Argento Series (2001),
two novels, Shy (1989) and Arctic Summer (1997), a book of memoirs,
Bedrooms Have Windows (1989), and two books of stories, Little Men
(1996) and I Cry Like a Baby (2001). He has also edited a collection
of short stories by the late Sam D'Allesandro, The Wild Creatures (
2005). For the San Francisco Poets Theater Killian has written over
thirty plays, including Stone Marmalade (1996, with Leslie Scalapino)
and Often (2001, with Barbara Guest).    His writing has been said to
have "tilted the world a little more askew, giving us a prismatic
perspective on love, sexuality, and aesthetics."   Come hear for
yourself!

Joseph Lease's critically acclaimed books of poetry include Broken
World (Coffee House Press) and Human Rights (Zoland Books, 1998). His
poem "'Broken World' (For James Assatly)" was selected for The Best
American Poetry 2002 (Scribner, 2002).  His poems have also been
featured on NPR and published in The AGNI 30th Anniversary Poetry
Anthology, VQR, Bay Poetics, Paris Review, and elsewhere.  Of Broken
World Marjorie Perloff wrote: "The poems in Joseph Lease's Broken
World are as cool as they are passionate, as soft-spoken as they are
indignant, and as fiercely Romantic as they are formally contained.
Whether writing an elegy for a friend who died of AIDS or playing
complex variations on Rilke's Duino Elegies ("If I cried out, / Who
among the angelic orders would / Slap my face, who would steal my /
Lunch money"), Lease has complete command of his poetic materials.
His poems are spellbinding in their terse and ironic authority: Yes,
the reader feels when s/he has finished, this is how it was--and how
it is.  An exquisite collection!"  Lease is Associate Professor of
Writing and Literature and Chair of the MFA Program in Writing at
California College of the Arts in San Francisco.


Unless otherwise noted, events are $5-10, sliding scale, free to
current SPT members and CCA faculty, staff, and students.
There's no better time to join SPT!
Check out:  http://www.sptraffic.org/html/supporters.htm

Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in Timken Lecture Hall
California College of the Arts 1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco
(just off the intersection of 16th & Wisconsin).

I know where they sell some excellent elderflower juice: at the supermarket
round the corner, sure it is no use to you.

The brand I use is Matin des Pyrenees Elder Blossom Jelly.  I get it at a little cheese/tea/coffee/chocolate shop near where I live called Coffee Market (one of the virtues of living in Berkeley).  They don't have a website, but their number is (510) 526-1333.  Happy hunting!

From October 31st to December 2nd, Diane Rothenberg and I will be =
residing in New York -- Brooklyn (Williamsburg) this time, courtesy of =
Marshall Reese and Nora Ligorano, 67 Devoe Street, Brooklyn 11211, New =
York.  The land line there is 718-782-9255, and our cell phone number is =
760-415-9889, while the email address remains the same.  During that =
time I will be away from the evening of November 4th to the morning of =
the 8th for Curitiba Literaria, a poetry festival in Curitiba, Brazil.

=20

While we've largely planned this as a chance to spend some extended time =
on native ground (I was in fact born in Williamsburg), I will also be =
participating in two poetry events:

=20

November 1, 6:00-8:00 p.m., a benefit reading for Will Alexander at the =
Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, north of Houston.

=20

November 20, 7:00 p.m., a reading with Dutch author and old friend Cees =
Noteboom at Pierogi Gallery, 117 North 9th St., Brooklyn (Williamsburg).

=20

Also, for those of you in or near New York, if you're around and want to =
get together during that time, please get back to us by email now or by =
e-mail or phone following our arrival.  We'll also try to be in touch =
from our end.

=20

Otherwise both of us are safe and well following the last line of fires =
in the surrounding precincts.



Looking forward & warm best wishes,

Subject:      An Update re Pluto Press--Victory against censorship; Press will
              continue to be distributed in USA by U Michigan Press
MIME-Version: 1.0

Earlier this month i sent the forward below, re the efforts to have the book
Overcoming Zionism by Joel Kovel disallowed US distribution, (it was
temporarily), and the possible cessation of its publisher, Pluto Press (UK)
being distributed in the USA by U Michigan Press.  Since Pluto is a major
publisher of leading contemporary philosophers, sociologists, ecological
advocates and Leftist thought, and depends heavily on the American
audience's purchasing power to keep it afloat, such an event would in effect
terminate the existence of the Press.
     The attacks on Dr Kovel's books came from a group which is part of the
larger umbrella organizations sponsoring the Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week
on campuses nationwide and is connected with various other organizations
which have attacked specific Professors, authors, editors, exhibition and
musical events organizers and publishers with growing frequency and
intensification of threats and media attacks.
      On Democracy Now this morning Amy Goodwin announced that Michigan
Press has unanimously voted to continue distribution of Pluto Press, and
conducted an interview with Dr, Kovel.  (His book advocates a democratic
one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian question.)
(it may be seen on
http:// democracynow.org
        Thank you to those who signed the petition included in the forward,
as it helped in the decision reached by the Michigan Press.
        Alex Jorgensen's posts re censorship are a reminder that "it can
happen here, too" unless citizens continue to stand up for the rights to
Freedom of Speech and Press.
         Freedom is not alway taken away all at once, but often one step at
a time, and each step has to be contested, before one is walked over by an
army of boots. One person, one book, one press--each one that is silenced
leads to the next and the next and the next until--there is quiet, and the
only words heard will be those of acquiesence.

I DID THE WEIRD MOTOR DRIVE


Sandy Baldwin created the nerve creature in Alfred Jarry's brain universe.
Baldwin's writing diagnosis materialized a mechanical larva in I DID THE WEIRD
MOTOR DRIVE. Word had the nanotechnologic feeler by Baldwin's geometrical
gene-control.

The author of this book is obviously the unnatural love grand child of William
*Sewer* Burroughs & Jim *J.G.* Ballard. Makes for a weird motor. Despite Theory
Police*s stem warmings, I mean, stern warnings, I*ll buy a pre-owned text from
this guy any day, though I know it to be habit forming.

- Pierre Joris



A self-reflexive archaeology whose target expands, an inverted maelstrom
engulfing violencetext, pornography, Ballardic-bardic structures - whatever
either millennium has to offer. Archaeology extends through codework to these
dreams haunting machines, "it was the dream in them," someone said, these
wrytings grace and plot the garbled future of the planet. 2. This is a
remarkable ground-breaking book, descendent of the movie marquee, military
manual, love story, Odyssey. There is nothing else like it. Think of narratives
of miracles for example, game boys or girls, or journeys illuminated by
glow-worm texts down past the wrecks of World War I and II. Everything is here
- literally everything. Think of the narratives of daily life, obscured,
confused, kludged - that too. Think of untoward brilliance, and that too. Read
this book! Just do it!

http://www.gtweekly.com/10-25-07-/something-like-a-poem-4

The most common and certainly the most difficult question I might be
asked by a stranger on an airplane is, =93What is your work about?=94 It=92=
s a
conundrum for any artist. And I suspect the one single quality that may
peg one as an artist=97as opposed to, say, a craftsman=97may be the artist=
=92s
inability to form a satisfactory answer.

I could say it=92s about the process of discovering what it=92s about. And
that would be honest. I could quote William Faulkner and say, =93it=92s
about the human heart in conflict with itself.=94 And that would be honest
too.

What my poems are about is=97and comes out of=97a kind of knowledge not
preconceived. It=92s available only in the course of literary composition,
a kind of wisdom that has to float like a piece of ice on its own
melting, as Robert Frost said a poem must. So I probably won=92t be able
to tell you what any particular poem of mine is about in any words other
than those in which it=92s composed. Frost, again, famously responded to a
question about what he meant by a particular poem, saying, =93If I=92d
wanted you to know, I=92d have told you in the poem.=94 On another such
occasion he simply read the poem again.

When someone tells me they wish they could read my poems but that they
just don=92t understand poetry, I hear, as a sub-text, them saying, =93I
just don=92t know what it means,=94 as if poetry were a kind of riddle that
only a select few can decipher. I think the difficulty may lie in the
word, =93understand,=94 when applied to a work of art. It seems to me a word
no more germane to a poem than to a painting, a sculpture, a piano
sonata or a novel. I will say that most of the poems I consider great,
that have grown and deepened in me over the course of 30 or 40 years,
were quite beyond me when I first encountered them. And yet they rang
somehow inside me, like music heard for the first time. And I knew from
the outset they were something I needed in my life, something I had to
have. I recognized quite surely, they were necessary to the one who made
them, and that they were necessary to me, though, on that first
occasion, that may have been all I was able to take from them. =93And so
we are grasped by what we cannot grasp,=94 Rainer Maria Rilke said.

=93Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening,=94 a poem by Frost, grasped me
the first time my mother, or one of my older sisters, read it to me, but
my appreciation of it has changed, deepened, saturated, over the years.
The same can be said of =93Leaves of Grass,=94 by Walt Whitman. I=92ve never
understood either of them in the sense that one may feel he=92s come to
understand a theory or an argument. How do we understand delight?

I can=92t say I understand a Mark Rothko painting, but often I can feel
what is grave and constant in human suffering when I stand before it. I
seem to grasp a Norman Rockwell painting on my first glimpse of it but
am seldom drawn to encounter it again, and in fact may become enervated
by repeated exposure. I may seem to be, and may, in fact, be a snob, but
I believe as my old friend and teacher, George Oppen wrote, =93=85 there are
other levels / but there are no other levels of art.=94

I don=92t think of an audience when I write, but if I did it would be
someone very much like me. I=92m deeply pleased when a neighbor, or a
stranger, writes or tells me they have been moved by or delighted by my
work=97deeply pleased, but what really matters is the response of those I
regard as my peers. I remember novelist Tom McGuane once saying =93What
really matters is the response of four or five friends. They=92re the ones
I had in mind when I wrote it.=94 William Keats said, =93I never wrote a
line with the least public thought. Everything I=92ve written has been for
the all-being, the principle of beauty, and the memory of great men.=94
And it occurs to me just now that what I write is for, and in response
to, Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, Willa Cather, John Keats, Federico
Garcia Lorca, Rilke, Antonio Machado, Frost and so many others=97those
through whom what I am and do began to wake up in me. I write for those
who taught me to see.

There is work, like that of John Asbery or, at times, Vladimir Nabokov,
that seldom moves or strikes a deep chord in me, but which I enjoy
visiting for its juice, its pure verbal facility, its virtuosity. I may
learn from or catch a little fire from them, though their art is not
what I aspire to. What is bad art to me is banality, of any kind, or
what Joseph Campbell called pornographic art=97=93=85 that which engenders
desire or loathing for that which is depicted.=94

I=92ve never understood Lorca, but I need him, just as I=92ve never
understood Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and I need him too.

Now that I=92ve come to a point in my life where I look back to what we
commonly call middle-age, I think, finally, that what my work is about
is this: Our working to discover what love is=97in its least
discriminating, least object-focused, and deepest sense=97when the
foundation stone of all we=92ve spent our lives thinking of as our own has
been worn away, something we might be given to understand, if only for a
moment, in something like a poem.

Poets Crag Hill and Geof Huth will give a reading entitled "Sightings &
Hearings" at the Stain Bar in Brooklyn, New York, on November 16th.
Combining their interest in visual, sound, and even textual poetry, they
will read and perform, together and apart, a wide range of works. This will
be the first time Hill and Huth have performed together since their
performance in March of this year, so don't miss this east coast appearance.
If a reading isn't enough encouragement, Stain Bar has a great selection of
New-York-only beer and other drinks.

Subject: Dan Gerber's 'Something Like a Poem'

http://www.gtweekly.com/10-25-07-/something-like-a-poem-4

The most common and certainly the most difficult question I might be
asked by a stranger on an airplane is, =93What is your work about?

YES, I THINK THE POINT ALWAYS IS THAT IT'S NOT "ABOUT"--IT "IS"










=94 It=92=
s a
conundrum for any artist. And I suspect the one single quality that may
peg one as an artist=97as opposed to, say, a craftsman=97may be the artist=
=92s
inability to form a satisfactory answer.





YES. NO ANSWER. THAT'S WHY IT EXISTS WITHOUT EXPLANATION.

I could say it=92s about the process of discovering what it=92s about. And
that would be honest. I could quote William Faulkner and say, =93it=92s
about the human heart in conflict with itself.=94 And that would be honest
too.

What my poems are about is=97and comes out of=97a kind of knowledge not
preconceived. It=92s available only in the course of literary composition,
a kind of wisdom that has to float like a piece of ice on its own
melting, as Robert Frost said a poem must. So I probably won=92t be able
to tell you what any particular poem of mine is about in any words other
than those in which it=92s composed. Frost, again, famously responded to a
question about what he meant by a particular poem, saying, =93If I=92d
wanted you to know, I=92d have told you in the poem.=94 On another such
occasion he simply read the poem again.
CORRECT RESPONSE. HOW ELSE TO RESPOND?

When someone tells me they wish they could read my poems but that they
just don=92t understand poetry, I hear, as a sub-text, them saying, =93I
just don=92t know what it means,=94 as if poetry were a kind of riddle that
only a select few can decipher. I think the difficulty may lie in the
word, =93understand,=94 when applied to a work of art. It seems to me a word
no more germane to a poem than to a painting, a sculpture, a piano
sonata or a novel. I will say that most of the poems I consider great,
that have grown and deepened in me over the course of 30 or 40 years,
were quite beyond me when I first encountered them. And yet they rang
somehow inside me, like music heard for the first time.

YES, IT'S THE MUSIC YOU NEVER HEARD BEFORE.
And I knew from
the outset they were something I needed in my life, something I had to
have. I recognized quite surely, they were necessary to the one who made
them, and that they were necessary to me, though, on that first
occasion, that may have been all I was able to take from them. =93And so
we are grasped by what we cannot grasp,
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO BE GRASPED BY =94 Rainer Maria Rilke said.

=93Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening,=94 a poem by Frost, grasped me
the first time my mother, or one of my older sisters, read it to me, but
my appreciation of it has changed, deepened, saturated, over the years.
The same can be said of =93Leaves of Grass,=94 by Walt Whitman. I=92ve never
understood either of them in the sense that one may feel he=92s come to
understand a theory or an argument. How do we understand delight?
WE DELIGHT IN DELIGHT.

I can=92t say I understand a Mark Rothko painting, but often I can feel
what is grave and constant in human suffering when I stand before it.
SO UNDERSTAND MARK ROTHKO THEN
 I
seem to grasp a Norman Rockwell painting on my first glimpse of it but
am seldom drawn to encounter it again, and in fact may become enervated
by repeated exposure. I may seem to be, and may, in fact, be a snob, but
I believe as my old friend and teacher, George Oppen wrote, =93=85 there are
other levels / but there are no other levels of art.=94

I don=92t think of an audience when I write, but if I did it would be
someone very much like me. I=92m deeply pleased when a neighbor, or a
stranger, writes or tells me they have been moved by or delighted by my
work=97deeply pleased, but what really matters is the response of those I
regard as my peers. I remember novelist Tom McGuane once saying =93What
really matters is the response of four or five friends. They=92re the ones
I had in mind when I wrote it.=94 William Keats said, =93I never wrote a
line with the least public thought. Everything I=92ve written has been for
the all-being, the principle of beauty, and the memory of great men.=94
And it occurs to me just now that what I write is for, and in response
to, Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, Willa Cather, John Keats, Federico
Garcia Lorca, Rilke, Antonio Machado, Frost and so many others=97those
through whom what I am and do began to wake up in me. I write for those
who taught me to see.
"I WRITE FOR MYSELF AND STRANGERS" GERTRUDE STEIN

There is work, like that of John Asbery or, at times, Vladimir Nabokov,
that seldom moves or strikes a deep chord in me, but which I enjoy
visiting for its juice, its pure verbal facility, its virtuosity. I may
learn from or catch a little fire from them, though their art is not
what I aspire to. What is bad art to me is banality, of any kind, or
what Joseph Campbell called pornographic art=97=93=85 that which engenders
desire or loathing for that which is depicted.=94

I=92ve never understood Lorca, but I need him, just as I=92ve never
understood Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and I need him too.

Now that I=92ve come to a point in my life where I look back to what we
commonly call middle-age, I think, finally, that what my work is about
is this: Our working to discover what love is
YES!!!





=97in its least
discriminating, least object-focused, and deepest sense=97when the
foundation stone of all we=92ve spent our lives thinking of as our own has
been worn away, something we might be given to understand, if only for a
moment, in something like a poem.

Catherine,
Here is my recipe for "Chocolate Raspberry Pavlova"--I owe it all to Nigella Lawson after 3 years in England, trying to make a pavlova cause pavlova's are big there (but this is the only one that's worked for me--and it's delicious!). I recommend this to EVERYONE as a replacement birthday cake or any other time a celebration is in order (which is always, of course, so please don't hesitate)(probably a good thing to include at poetry readings):

CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY PAVLOVA

for the chocolate meringue base:
6 egg whites
1 cup granulated sugar
3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder, sifted
1 teaspoon balsamic or red wine vinegar
2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped

for the topping:
2 1/4/ cups heavy cream
1 very full pint raspberries
2-3 tablespoons coarsely grated
bittersweet chocolate


Preheat the oven to 350/ line baking sheet with parchment paper

Beat egg whites until satiny peaks form/ then beat in sugar/ a spoonful at a time until the meringue is stiff and shiny. Sprinkle over the cocoa and vinegar and the chopped chocolate. Gently fold verything until cocoa is thoroughly mixed in. Mound onto a baking sheet in fat circle approx. 9 inches in diameter, smoothing the sides and top. Place in the over, then immediately turn the temperature down to 300 F/ cook for approx 1-1/4 hrs When it's ready it should look crisp around the edges and on the sides and be dry on top/ when you prod the center you should feel the promise of squidginess beneath your fingers. Turn off the oven and open the door slightly, and let the chocolate meringue disk cool and completely.
When you're ready to serve, invert onto a big, flat-bottomed plate. Whisk the cream till thick but still soft and pile it on top of the meringue, then scatter over the raspberies. Coarsely grate the chocolate so that you get curls rather than rubble, as you don't want the raspberries' luscious color and form to be obscured, and sprinke haphazardly over te top, letting some fall, as it will, on the plate's rim.

Note: always eat while wearing party hats (my suggestion)
Bobbi Lurie

A Tribute to Fup. Store Cat.
October 29th, 2007: Posted by Ron Silberstein

http://www.powells.com/blog/?p=3D2568

Fup, the resident cat at Powell's Technical Books, passed away on =20
October 25. She was 19 years old. She continued to greet her admiring =20=

public to the end, when her health failed and there was no choice but =20=

to put her to sleep. Her lifelong veterinarian made the trip out to =20
the store to perform the task and Fup died peacefully at home with =20
several of her longtime co-workers present.

Fup was born on or about June 30, 1988. She was adopted as a kitten =20
by the Technical Store's first manager, so her exact birthdate is =20
unknown and she was always quite coy about that. As for the origin of =20=

her name, legend has it that the manager's sister had a cat named =20
Puff, so he sort of spelled that backwards. There was also a book =20
titled Fup by Jim Dodge, published in 1983, which may have played =20
into it as well.

When Powell's Technical Books moved to its present address in =20
November 1990, Fup made the move as well. After clearing the building =20=

of any remaining mice, she claimed the store as her own. She showed =20
little interest in the outside world, except to watch birds and =20
falling leaves outside the window. She didn't care for toys, either =97 =20=

Fup took her position quite seriously. Except for the summer of 1997, =20=

when she was moved to an employee's apartment for about six weeks =20
while the store was being remodeled, her rule was uninterrupted.

In her youth, Fup would sometimes climb ladders and hide at the top =20
of book fixtures to look down upon the humans in her domain. Over the =20=

years, Fup acquired a well-earned reputation for biting employees who =20=

intruded on her time for more than about 30 seconds. However, she =20
would always be sitting in front of the office to greet whoever came =20
to open the store in the morning, demanding her serving of canned =20
food for breakfast. She was more patient with visitors; Fup played =20
the celebrity game well. She received many gifts and cards and emails =20=

from fans, which she appreciated.

In her later years, she mellowed out quite a bit and even became =20
friendlier towards her co-workers, especially if they shared their =20
lunches. Her favorite foods were canned tuna, chicken (especially =20
Tandoori), and pulled pork. Cold cuts were also welcome.

There will not be a service; however, a memorial to be placed =20
somewhere in the store is planned for a future date. Tributes can =20
left in the comments section below.

In lieu of cards or flowers, we respectfully request you make a gift =20
donation to the Oregon Humane Society in Fup's name.

READING DUNCAN READING:
ESSAYS ON THE POETICS OF DERIVATION

(Edited by Stephen Collis & Graham Lyons)


“No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete
meaning alone.  His significance, his appreciation is
the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and
artists”
	-T.S. Eliot, “Tradition and the Individual Talent”

“I draw my ‘own’ thought in reading Dante as from a
well-spring.”
		-Robert Duncan

Robert Duncan’s penchant for referring to himself as a
‘derivative” poet is well documented if not
notorious—and the extent of his poetic derivations is
readily apparent in his published works, where poem
after poem enters into dialogue with a wide array of
precursors and companions, great and small. Far from a
Bloomian striving against received tradition, however,
Duncan’s derivations function simultaneously as
poetics, as literary criticism, as self-reflection,
indeed as reading.  Whether read as a matter of
influence, homage, or appropriation, Duncan’s poetics
is clearly situated on a blurred line between the
processes of reading and writing—a space where (self)
expression and derivation (from others) blend so that
the poet’s “own” thought is, in practice, difficult to
discern from the poet’s sources in “others” writing.
What are the implications of this difficulty, this
ambiguity?  What possibilities issue from Duncan’s
stance as at once reader and poet?  How might Duncan’s
derivations open out to a politics?  An ethics?

READING DUNCAN READING will gather essays addressing
both Duncan’s derivations from the work of other
writers (the uses he makes of his sources), and
derivations from Duncan’s work (the work of writers
who have themselves drawn upon Duncan’s
“well-spring”). The list of the former could include
(but is certainly not limited to): Charles Baudelaire,
William Blake, Robin Blaser, Paul Celan, Jean Cocteau,
T. S. Eliot, Dante, Sigmund Freud, Thom Gunn, George
Herbert, H.D., James Joyce, Denise Levertov, George
MacDonald, Gerard de Nerval, Charles Olson, Edith
Sitwell, Jack Spicer, Gertrude Stein, Wallace Stevens,
William Carlos Williams, and Louis Zukofsky. The list
of those writers whose work may in some ways be read
as flowing from Duncan’s could include: Robin Blaser,
Michael Davidson, Peter Gizzi, Susan Howe, Lisa
Jarnot, Ronald Johnson, Robert Kelley, Michael Palmer,
Peter O’Leary, and John Tranter, amongst others.

Abstracts of 250-500 words with contact information
should be sent to Stephen Collis, scollis@sfu.ca by no
later than January 31st 2008.

I just visited Powell's last spring. It is a wonderful but somewhat overwhelming bookstore. I am trying to remember if I saw Fup among the rows of books--I don't think so.
  May Fup rest in peace.

A Tribute to Fup. Store Cat.

  This was certainly not my intention. I think that if a poet invents a useful piece of terminology (in this case, "torque"), this is not because the word solely represents an aspect of his own practice--quite the opposite, its usefulness is represented by its breadth of application, and maybe even by the way it can produce counterintuitive _but convincing_ readings. I think I write a fine essay on torque in the poetry of Philip Larkin, but I would not in doing so be trying to show that Larkin is a Language poet. (I do enjoy absurdism in the work of others, but don't inulge in it myself.) Can I point out that I cite Frank O'Hara without making Picabia a poet of the New York School and Kenneth Rexroth without turning him into a member of the San Francisco Renaissance. You rightly say that "poetry of the Dadaists has played a huge
 role
around the world for a very long time"--though in my opinion, as I point out in the review, to see Picabia's poetry solely through the lens of Dada is a very superficial approach--so why are you surprised that he might be associated, either in my review or in the book's jacket blurbs, with poets for whom he would have played such an influential role, either directly or indirectly? "Already the poet is being 'set
 up' for
a certain kind of reception and as it were being taken possesion
 of--'one of
OUR contemporaries.'" Well, I don't know about the "one of our contemporaries" part; I spent a lot of time in that review setting out the historical particulars of Picabia's situation; but isn't reading a sort of "possession" or appropriation?
  Still, "torque" does not turn Picabia into Silliman any more than situating him within a certain "tradition" would turn him into T.S. Eliot just because Eliot once used that word in a famous essay. Unless of course one has a specific paranoia about Silliman as some people do about Eliot.

  Dear Stephen and Barry:

Apologies for the delay in responding--i began this Sunday and ever since
have been experiencing the interrelationship of the intermittent with the
interminable--intermittently being able to write a few words among
interminable interruptions, making the intermittent entries become an
interminable project unless ----put it this way--i better be done in time
for Game One of the "World Serious" as Ring Lardner's characters call it--

Thank you very much for the review Barry--i am very much looking forward to
reading the book and liked your review--
the question i bring up here--is more of a general one which also includes
the review, but only a tiny tiny bit of the review--
i shd also mention that at one point Picabia was a friend of Gertrude
Stein's
and before people think otherwise i have been a fan of her works for so long
a time it is impossible for me to grasp actually having able to traverse so
many eons--who knows, perhaps i, too, was a friend of Gertrude Stein's and
am just suffering from temporary amnesia? I do recall going to the place
in Paris, but not finding any one at home at the time . . .


The copy of the Picabia book i found at the Schwarz indie bookstore (yet to
check library) is shrink wrapped, so only had the opportunity to peruse the
prose stylings of the blurbographers, including of course Jerome Rothenberg,
who sent his to this list. The others are Charles Bernstein, Marjorie
Perloff & David Antin. If one includes Barry's use of Silliman's "torque"
in his review and Rothenberg's Novalis quote that "Language is Delphi," the
implication is that Picabia is a sort of proto-Language poet. Or even an
honorary member--"one of our contemporaries."
This brings up some interesting questions about the nature of the
perceptions of the productions of time when examined through lenses ground
and polished to the present's specifications.
I am looking forward to reading the book to see--or read Picabia's
Collected works to find--if he anywhere writes out various ideas of his own
about the techniques he is employing which Barry uses the word "torgue"
for. An interesting effect of using this word is that, rather than giving
the impression that Picabia's work long ago did what is for some time now
claimed to be the provenance uniquely of American poetry, it instead gives
the impression that Picabia's work is being turned retrospectively into a
branch of Language Poetry by virtue of this assocaition. All of the blurbs
keep saying that Picabia is "one of our contemporaries". From another point
of view would not this indicate in fact how reactionary the present is that
it is only now realizing that things of sixty to a nearly a hundred years
ago are "our contemporaries"?
If one reads Hans Richter's 1963 Dada Art and Anti-Art or Abstract
Expressionist painter Robert Motherwell's great anthology originally issued
in the 1950's The Dada Painters and Poets, Dada poetry is treated very
seriously for American readers. ( Richter notes at one point having Walter
Benjamin translate a Picabia poem for a journal that he edited.) The great
Japanese poet Shinkichi Takahashi, known in English for his volumes of Zen
poetry and writings, was Japan's first Dadaist, wrote and published Dada
poetry and got himself arrested for Dada activities.The influence of Dada in
his Zen poetry is very strong. (There is a very fascinating book by a
Korean scholar on Tzara and Takahashi.)
The fact of the matter is that poetry of the Dadaists has played a huge role
around the world for a very long time--the works of Tzara, Hausmann,
Picabia, Schwitters and a poet as yet far too little known in the USA--the
artist Hans (Jean) Arp, who wrote in both French and German. Dada also
produced a vast body of Visual Poetry in every one of its locations globally
and in New York, Picabia was closely associated with Stieglitz. (His
journal 391 alludes to Steiglitz's 291.) W C Williams hung out with the NYC
Dada crowd (and was particularly perturbed by the Baroness--herself a poet
of note). Williams on the final pages of Spring and All includes a critique
of Zaum, very far in advance of its much later "discovery" in the USA of the
late 20th century.
A great deal of the traditions which grew out of Dada and the
Futurisms have been for the most part marginalized in American poetry, and
when admitted into it, as with the example of Picabia, seen through a very
particular lens, in order in a sense to "torque" it into "the American
Tree." One might say that this is the imperialist aspect of American
thought, that this being the land of invention, of course all things have
their true origin here, and if not, then they can be very quickly subsumed
into the narrative of the American Dream, Manifest Destiny and be included
in some antholgies alongside American "masters."
Fellini said of his Satyricon: "It is a science fiction film set in
the past." This is an excellent way to describe some of the possibilities
opened up in examining this way of thinking.
In the tape-essay "Renga and the new Sentence," Tosa Motokiyu, Ojiu
Norinaga and Okura Kyojin discuss and demonstrate that Silliman's "New
Sentence" has actually been present and functioning for four centuries in
Japanese Renga, which in its 20th century experimentations has moved even
further than its American counterpart, especially in concerns with single
author ownership of texts, an ideological construction firmly embedded in
the "private enterprise" emphasis of American capitalism. The tape-essay
both undercuts the "originality" of the New Sentence and at the same time
lends a kind of added stature to it by virtue of its being joined with a
tradition it was unaware of. It can still, in a way, lay claim to being
something of "an American original" by virtue of this happenstance, and
hence underscore the prescience of its author. In a funny way, a person
could even "torque" the situation and claim that the American is revealing
to the Japanese what they did not know that they had been doing all along,
just as poor Picabia never knew at all what he was up to, and now "we" do.
At the time (1992) this tape-essay appeared in Aerial, the three
discussants were known as the translator-editors of the Japanese poet Araki
Yasusda. Today, Yasusada having emerged as the fiction he "really" is,
Motokiyu is the pseudonym of the late person averred to be the "author."
Who the other two discussants "really" are--or-were--or will be--as with
Motokiyu, becomes unmoored from single authorship identity--and drifts into
the Poe-eque regions hovering between the living and the dead, floating
among the Real and the Unreal, among identities actual, pseudonymous and
anonymous, ghost written and posthumous.
These multiplicities of hyper authors can be understood I think not
only as a critique of "authorship" and "authority," but of reading as well.
Note again the authors chosen to write the blurbs introducing Picabia and
mentioned in the review. Reading these names and what they write and are
(presumed to be) associated with in the reader's mind, one is guided
already into a certain way of reading Picabia, a frame within which to view
his techniques and formal qualities. Already the poet is being "set up" for
a certain kind of reception and as it were being taken possesion of--"one of
OUR contemporaries."
That a critique of authorship leads to one of reading is one of the
myriad fascinating ideas put forth in Borges' story "Pierre Menard." The
story opens with a critique of a catalogue of the works of Menard, leading
to the discussion of his most important but missing text, his exact, yet
superior, word for word writing of a few chapters of Don Quixote. Menard's
labors are immense, his drafts thousands of torn up pages. Yet the little
he produces, while seemingly the futile word for word reproduction of the
original. takes on added qualities not possesed by Cervantes' text.
Demonstrating how greatly the text written by Menard differs from that of
Cervantes, Borges' narrator quotes a passage which he says is "a mere
rhetorical eulogy" by "the ingenious layman" Cervantes, but, when written
by Menard, coming after William James in time, "does not define history as
an investigation of reality, but its origin," and whose "final clauses are
shamelessly pragmatic."
Borges' narrator also notes the contrast ins styles between the 20the
century Frenchman writing in 17th century Spanish (it "suffers a certain
affectation") and that of the 17th Century Spaniard "who handles easily the
ordinary Spanish of his time."
In short, what might at first have appeared to be a very confining
exercise opens instead on a radically new adventure.
"Menard (perhaps without wishing to) has enriched, by means of a new
technique, the hesitant and rudimentary art of reading: the technique, with
its infinite applications, urges us to run through the Odyssey as if it were
written after the Aeneid . . . .This technique would fill the dullest of
books with adventure. Would not the attributing of The Imitation of Christ
to Louis-Ferdinand Celine or James Joyce be a sufficient renovation of its
tenuous spiritual counsels?"
In this way, one can claim that Picabia is really "one of us"--because
he seems to fit in with dicta of the time by "one of us." (That is, if we
read him via torque.) Yet what this does is "fill the dullest of books with
adventure"--that is, the dull book of all the vast decades and countries of
poets who have been studiously ignored , and when "discovered," are found to
be surprisingly like what "we" have known about al the time.
"Torque" is an example of this. I recall reading an old essay of
Bernstein's in which he also uses a car associated word--"souped up" for a
somewhat similar purpose, of adding power to a word, a phrase, a line,
sentence, etc. This kind of "gear head" talk fits in with the manly phrase
"muscular prose" which crops up so very often among American male writers.
(Including Pound and Bernstein.) It also follows in a line of American
poets who made analogies of writing and driving--Creeley in the Introduction
to Naked Poetry, Kerouac ("Writing is silent meditation going a 100 miles
per hour," and Neal Cassady as the ultimate torquer), and W.C. Williams,
halting his car at the train crossing and using the time to write what he is
seingo n his doctor's rounds.
Yet the origin of the automotive fetish is to be found in the first
manifesto of modernism, Marinetti's 1909 "Founding and Manifesto of
Futurism." Amazingly enough, Marinetti's machine is not simply a mechanical
device, but also the predatory machine par excellence, the celebrated
companion of Lautreamont's Maldoror and haunter of Hollywood beaches:

"They thought it (the car) was dead, my beautiful shark, but a caress from
me was enough to revive it: and there it was, alive again, running on its
powerful fins!."

(Marinetti in 1909 by means of Futurist speeds seeing already the fins
of Fifties American cars driven at Cassady warp speeds--)

Reading of Picabia's later work in which he is doing his reworkings
of Nietzsche's texts--is he not moving into the realms of Borges' Menard, of
Motokiyu's Yasusada and friends in the 1930's writing 1980's American poetry
in a tradition already four hundred years old, and claimed to be
specifically influenced by a Jack Spicer then aged 12?

In early twentieth century western modernism there is the search for
an "outside" to contact for an influx of the "other," of the "new," of the
"unknown,." Kandinsky turned to the study of the art of children Picasso
and others to the art of Africa, to the incorporation of outside elements
into a painting and poem by means of collage, the importing of techniques
and effects from telegraph, radio, cinema, x-rays, photogrpahy, aerial
photography. The shapes and sizes of post cards became elements in
structuring poems such as Apollinaire's calligrammes. The extreme brevity
of Ungaretti's poetry written in between gun fire and artillery blasts. The
rapid disintegration of language from Futurist shatteings of syntax and
abandonment of punctuations to the chance drawings of words from a hat of
Dada. And from there to using the letter as an element (Hausmann,
Schwitters). Kruchonyhk turned to the Pentcoastal speaking in tongues for
inspiration in the founding of Zaum. And after Prinzhorn's work on The Art
of the Mentally Ill appeared in 1922, there are the first importings of the
works ft the clinical "outsider," into serious consideration in art and
poetry.
By contrast, one does not find such a turning in most American poetry
to an outside. It's very interesting that Gertrude Stein's example has
attained such a (forgive me) huge presence in American poetics,as some
aspects of her work exemplify a turning to an extreme focus on a private
language in a privatized sphere, where the Author in a sense reigns supreme.
I don't recall in which book, but Stein remarks that one of the
reasons she lived in Paris was that this way she would not be hearing daily
the english language. (Well--what about Alice and all the visitors?) What
she meant was that to be in an environment where English was seldom and
selectively heard, in her writing the only voice she really was hearing was
her own. It is not that speech and voice vanish--she did write palys and
operas after all--it is that writing can be purified of any sounds other
than what she is able to have complete control of through this intense
listening only to oneself. The privateness of language becomes in many
works the "subject" so to speak--it is both the subject that writes and the
subject of which it writes. The extreme density of a text like "Stanzas in
Meditation," for example, is a kind of collapse of matter on its way to
being something approaching a black hole. The private and its
privatization of a literary landscape, a geography, a history, create a
topology of seemingly impenetrable surfaces. The "isolationism" associated
with many traditions of American thought manifests as this outward opacity
of an extremely self-involved private language.
This is only one aspect of Stein's writing, to be sure, but is one that
has a lot of influence and cachet. In a way, it is in the tradition of a
Whitman, a "Song of Myself" and (my) " "Body Electric" channeled into
"material words" rather than worlds, cosmos. The words though, have become
the sole property of Gertrude Stein, her private language. It is still, for
all the community of friends and celebrity, the American individualist who
is the Author and Owner supreme.
One reads that Picabia is like a contemporary. Might one not read
this the other way round--and think--oh my God!!--we are only now reaching
what Picabia was up to many millenia ago? That via isolationism, selective
filtering of texts chosen to fit into the narrative which will culminate in
"our contemporeinity" being at the apex of all poetic accomplishments in the
"avant" and "post avant, " that via all this, the world has none the less
gone on turning and poets producing astounding works and creating
innumerable innovations, smashing all manner of conventions and taboos,
while Americans have been busy with imperial Sentences of Death, Torture,
Security, Surveillance, Ethnic Cleansing and other favorite activities with
one hand and "radical" or "conservative" poetry debates on the other?
For example, following Picabia's example, one could use his working
with Nietzsche's to turn around and use Picabia's own texts as the lens
through which to read, say, "one of our contemporaries."
Or employ the method of the fictional Japanese and Menard--to use and
old text in the present as though written again now as a means by which to
examine works in the present, works in the past.
This proliferates the means by which may make use, learn from,
investigate with texts not as something to be fitted in to the appointed
slot--but something which is welcomed in as a tool for opening up,
disordering, creating new arrangements, knocking over the applecart,
In short--not to say, ah a welcome addition to the shelf of the
history of --the continued reflection of our singular radiance--
Bu aha!--something --uncanny, alive--not yet caged in he zoo or
pinned in the insect collection in the poetry sections . . .

I don't think anyone mentioned as yet among innovators and makers of
invective and so forth Archilochus? The inventor or the iambic pentameter,
of lyric poetry and of the mighty insult--one so vile that it caused the man
it was directed at to kill himself. Also one of the greatest of comic
poets. Mercenary solider, bastard son of an important person, poet
extraordinaire.
Re the quote from Novalis that "Language is Delphi"--
Heraclitus writes: "The One whose Oracle is at Delphi neither
speaks nor conceals but give signs."
Signs may be birds, rainbows, strange beings, a weird object. For
Heraclitus it would seem that the Oracle does not use language. This is
close to the understanding of "The Tao that can be named is not the Tao."
And also from Heraclitus: "One cannot hide from that which never sets."










This paradoxical aspect is examined in the Yasusada book Doubled
Flowering in the footnotes re "Renga and the New Sentence" and also in the
Borges story "Pierre Menard":






You're right

ANNE SEXTON =AD THE POET AND THE WOMAN =AD REMEMBERED AND CELEBRATED BY FOU=
R FRIENDS

Join us for our sixth annual tribute to Anne Sexton, who wrote fearlessly
about family, sexuality, despair, and joy, pioneering a radical new poetry.
Four writers who knew her well will read from her poetry and from their own
writing. The friends and colleagues who gather to remember her are: Victor
Howes, fellow teacher; Lois Ames, who co-edited Sexton's Life in Letters;
Robert Clawson, who managed Anne Sexton and her Kind the poet's rock band;
and Suzanne Berger, one of her students. A portrait of Anne emerges from
their recollections and stories and from her own writing. Funny,
free-spirited, transgressive and wildly intelligent, she broke away
from the conventions of suburban middle class life. The aggressive,
disturbing honesty of her writing still influences poetry today.

News, belated news. Merwin reads tonight, Mumford rm, library of congress.
If forced to decide between Ashberry or Merwin, which one would I prefer to read
on my desolate Island? Merwin, who lives in Hawaii, has the flora & fauna advantage. LANGUAGE purist seem to swear on Ashberry's Tennis Court poems. My favorite is "The Wave." The shorter poems in "The Wave" never seem to falter, there's a beautiful adaption of Baudelaire, full of fatigue & yearning, & of course the splendid long poem.

October 22, 2007                            W.S. Merwin, Winner of the Bobbitt Poetry Prize, Will Read, Oct. 31                          Celebrated poet W.S. Merwin will receive the 2006 Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry and read selections of his work at 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 31, in the Mumford Room on the sixth floor of the James Madison Building, 101 Independence Ave. S.E., Washington, D.C.

I don't generally do desert, but if I'm having folks over for dinner
and good manngoes are available I skin and slice them, marinate them
in the fridge for a few hours in sauterne or another decent desert
wine (pineau des charentes is almost as good, and a lot cheaper than
most of the alternatives), squeeze some lime over them and serve.
Also works well half mangoes half ripe peaches (again, if you can get
good ones). I tried adding strawberries. Doesn't work so well.
Sometimes I add a couple of slices of fresh ginger to the marinade.

Here's a good thing to do with broccoli. Steam it and some garlic
cloves more than you think you should, put in food processor with
some olive oil (don't overdo it) add salt to taste (I also put in a
bit of paprika) and puree. If you need more liquid use the steaming
water. It should have about the consistency of mashed potatoes.
Heriberto Yepez named this "broccomole."

White clam sauce. Steam a pound or so of soft-shelled clams
(remember, most of the weight is shell). Eat them (yum). Set aside
steaming liquid and store in fridge (or freeze as need be). You're
going to use a 6.5 oz can of chopped clams for the recipe, so chop up
about the same amount of garlic. heat olive oil in a skillet, cook
garlic briefly, throw in some chopped-up fresh rosemary, a little
paprika (my grandmother was hungarian, what can I say), maybe a
little cayenne if you're in the mood. Other fresh herbs do
nicely--thyme comes to mind--but I wouldn't confuse the taste by
using more than one. Now add say half a cup of the reserved clam
juice, also the clam juice from the can of clams. Cook at high heat,
stirring and scraping off the sides occasionally (wooden spoon,
please) until clam juice begins to look creamy. If you want more
finished product, add more clam juice and do as above. When you're
almost satisfied add dry white wine and reduce, taste, probably add
more white wine. Add clams and let them get hot, then toss with a
pound of spaghetti, grated cheese, some fresh ground black pepper.
Yum yum. Feeds two to three. Note: This takes no more than 20-30 minutes.

Remember to have someone else wash the dishes.

Hi all,

"Generations of Inspiration and Community:
Poetry Project Directors Past and Present Talk."

With Stacy Szymaszek having recently begun her tenure as artistic director
of The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, Boog City politics editor
Christina Strong and I recently conducted email interviews with her and a
past director, Anne Waldman, about the East Village, community, and the
future of The Poetry Project. About half of the dialogue is in the print
edition (and online pdf: http://welcometoboogcity.com/boogpdfs/bc45.pdf) of
the paper, while the entire dialogue is available online:

Thanks,
David

Try this for halloween. Instead of the traditional sugary stuff give
the wee visitors blood pudding. Fun to see how they react, and it
does seem more appropriate.

*The Compleat Manuscript Poetry Conference *
*Next conference: November 30--December 4, 2007 *



In this unique conference, where enrollment is strictly limited to six
qualified participants, each manuscript is thoroughly read by both editors
in the weeks before the conference begins. At the conference, Jeffrey
Levine, poet, editor and publisher of Tupelo Press and Joan Houlihan, poet,
editor and founder of the Concord Poetry Center, analyze and critically
discuss every manuscript with the author. This conference also provides
behind-the-scenes advice on submissions and recommendations for both
journals and presses. All poets read from their manuscripts at evening
readings.



The November conference takes place in a quintessential New England setting
in view of the Berkshire mountain range at Spirit Fire, a lovely and
secluded retreat. For an application and complete guidelines, please visit
http://www.compleatmanuscript.com/November/ You may also call 978-897-0054,
email conferences@colrainpoetry.com or write to The Compleat Manuscript,
Concord Poetry Center, 40 Stow Street, Concord, MA 01742-2418.



*Attendees say:*



"Eye-opening..I wanted a stepped-back view of my work, and certainly got
one, one that I can apply to thinking about existing poems and to future
work. The work you both did for us was both detailed and generous. A clear,
well-lit path. Many, many thanks for your focus and energy. It was a very
rich experience." *Diana Gordon, Northampton, MA*



I have been to many good conferences, but what I liked about this one was
the sustained attention of my (and others') work, to whole manuscripts. I
appreciated the feedback which was local, general, and global=97on the poem=
s
themselves, including which lines don't work; on the sections; on the whole
conception and shape of the collection.  I got specific ideas about titles,
and the tension needed between the title and the first line=85specific idea=
s
about beginning in medias res, as it were, and not beginning with so much
narration (my problem).

*Carol* *Gilbertson, Professor of English, Decorah, IA

*

It [the conference] helped me see with an editor's eyes.  I now can imagine
the process even more thoughtfully. It [the conference] surpassed my
expectations.  *Paul Brooke, Ames, IA *



Thorough and frank opinions about the poems and manuscript.

*Norm Goodwin, Edmonds, WA*



I feel a new sense of motivation toward my work, and I'm prepared to get
back into it and revise.  I was pleased to receive, orally in our sessions,
detailed feedback from the editors/poets on faculty whose work I respect.  =
