laura, what i mean is simply that the mechanism for deciding which scripts
to produce (which includes, of course, not reading a script at all) is
severe indeed... ruthless, as i say... of course i'm aware of the entire
loop involved in making such decisions, and it's not that such decisions
aren't made with "good intentions" either, but---

no need to beat this to death... my point was the there is, cool and
reasonable or no, a quagmire at work in rendering "aesthetic" judgments
that are de facto more about marketing... i was picking on the trades,
but i've seen variants of this quagmire at work in my beloved small
presses too...

i don't think this applies as much to the hollywood item, at least not out
of the gates (as it were)... the hollywood decision, rendered by any
number of folks (incl. story readers etc.), turns in the main on what can
become a successful production... and as we know by now, certainly, a shit
film can gross millions globally... still, as distressing as such a
situation might be, i nevertheless find it a refreshing departure from the
quagmire i refer to, above...

and i assure you, the irony is not lost on me, which is what i think you
want me to register, right?...

best,

joe

Geesch! What tiresome, petty scholastic-claptrap... very annoying. I
enjoyed seeing some Brakhage films in the 80's (they seemed to reinforce
the ideas of visual language in my ISBN-Books), and thought this journal
would kindle a return visit to the films... Big disappointment.

In the interests of brevity I've decided to respond to two threads at
once. First, to respopnd to WilliamJamesAustin's post on the Po-biz
woes, and second to respond to Douglas Messerli's exercise from Gary
Sullivan, who suggested he select a conventional poem, type it into his wo=
rd
processor, then cut and paste the poem into Babelfish (a translating servi=
ce).

OK, so if this translation thing could work for a poem, maybe it could wor=
k
for poetics as well. So I took Bill's post and ran it through Babelfish a =
few
times . . . several, to be exact. It comes out, here represented three tim=
es,
as sage advice to the poet. And each one different. Imagine, one post can
become three manifestoes! (and also a way that I'm able to bring in a thir=
d
thread . . . )

So here they are:

1.
People, why whole excitement? It's everything brings money (silver) and to=
 be
able to. Always it (he) (it [him], her [it]) was. This=92s a step to brain=
ing her.
Those who triumph are benedicts for somebody (or more than that) it's of
the you of being able to money (silver), or is near, or warned for, somebo=
dy
who's of the you of money (silver) to be able to. They're lucky. A positiv=
e
evaluation publishes a big zero, until him (it) / elm that the marks (bran=
ds)
estimate is connected. The innuendos, events, the types. You don't obtain =
the
Jesus work in =91in the similarity=92 of the leader (you), and the leader =
is never
forced (it [he]) to be estimated (esteemed) by (his [sound], the work)
glittering, however you are. And in and in it (he) it (she) (it [him], her=
 [it]) goes,
the generation after the generation. The ugly, granted (tuned) jealousies,=

we=97nevertheless it (she) (it [him], her [it])=97have a custom to congrat=
ulate
those who obtain happy. The good custom, the right-hand side? Our
admittance suggests that the hierarchies are both naturally and inevitably=
, when
they're ours (our), of the ideal. Better.

2.
People, why complete excitement?  It is brings all money (silver) and you =
can
too.  Always it (it) (it [it], it [as]) was.  This is stepped to a brained=
 her.  That
triumph are/is capable benedicts for someone (or more than that) it of the=

you of the becoming that to money (silver), is or is warn is to be, can ne=
ar, or
for, someone that of the you of the money (silver) to.  They are happy.  A=

vents,

od
custom, the right page?  Our entrance proposes that the hierarchies are na=
tural
and unavoidable both, if they are ideal they are (or) that.  Better.

3.
The persons, why entire animation?  It is and brings all money (silver) an=
d to

About the Chicago Review Stan Brakhage issue, brad brace writes:

<Geesch! What tiresome, petty scholastic-claptrap . . . very
annoying.>

I reply:

I disagree with you here. Any time one can read the letters of an
interesting artist, it's worth while. Granted the Brakhage
correspondences are not always up to the level of "kindling a return
visit to the films," but they are helpful ways to get into his thought
processes. The conversation between Brakhage and Ronald Johnson alone
was worth the subscription price to me.

I must amend.  Bablefish is clearly an important evaluative device.  Of
course the obvious next questions are "How much does it cost?" and "Who do I
have to know to get a copy?"  Thanks JG for the laughs.  I enjoyed the
"translations."  Best, Bill

Douglas,

Another suggestion: Pick one of your own (or someone else's) poems in
English, translate it into another language. then treating that version as an
orginal, translate it into English. Permutate first and third versions into a
sestina.

Black Sparrow Flies the Coop, But Authors Land Safely

"You'd be shocked at how much Charles Bukowski brings in every year,"
says Black Sparrow founder John Martin.

Martin isn?t kidding, judging by the severance package he handed to
each of his dozen employees when he closed his literary house in May.
The sum? One year's pay, an amount funded by years of running a
profitable literary house and the sale of  Bukowski's backlist to Dan
Halpern at Ecco.

Martin closed his press in May. The news didn't get much play, in part
because the house always reveled in its obscurity (from its bio: many
of [our] names will be unfamiliar to a reader introduced to
contemporary American writing by, for example, The New Yorker), in
part because it wasn't so much a closure as a transfer. The works of
Bukowski, Paul Bowles and John Fante will live on at Ecco; the Wyndham
Lewis line goes to Gingko Press and the rest of the list to Boston's
David Godine.

"It really was the best solution," Martin says. "The employees wanted
badly for me to keep the thing going but I had an opportunity now and
I didn't know where things would be five years from now." It was not
only a way to take care of the employees, Martin says, but to keep the
entire backlist alive.

Martin also worked out a deal with Ecco where he will edit five
unpublished Bukowski manuscripts. Bukowski has had more work found
posthumously than the Honeymooners - he's already had eight books
released since his death in 1994.-Steven Zeitchik

David Godine has the Charles Reznikoff stock.  As you all probably know, =
Holocaust is out of print.  As far as I understand, David Godine also has =
the rights to the Reznikoff works which are out of print.  What happens =
when the current stocks are sold?  I don't know, and unfortunately, =
although it seems to me, on the basis of student affiliation to his work, =
that Reznikoff could have be massively popular, sales are minute.  John =
Martin, Seamus Cooney, and Black Sparrow, deserve every tribute for making =
Reznikoff's works available. I sincerely hope David Godine will keep the =
works in print in print, reprint those out of print, most especially =

Black Sparrow Flies the Coop, But Authors Land Safely

"You'd be shocked at how much Charles Bukowski brings in every year,"
says Black Sparrow founder John Martin.

Martin isn?t kidding, judging by the severance package he handed to
each of his dozen employees when he closed his literary house in May.
The sum? One year's pay, an amount funded by years of running a
profitable literary house and the sale of  Bukowski's backlist to Dan
Halpern at Ecco.

Martin closed his press in May. The news didn't get much play, in part
because the house always reveled in its obscurity (from its bio: many
of [our] names will be unfamiliar to a reader introduced to
contemporary American writing by, for example, The New Yorker), in
part because it wasn't so much a closure as a transfer. The works of
Bukowski, Paul Bowles and John Fante will live on at Ecco; the Wyndham
Lewis line goes to Gingko Press and the rest of the list to Boston's
David Godine.

"It really was the best slution," Martin says. "The employees wanted
badly for me to keep the thing going but I had an opportunity now and
I didn't know where things would be five years from now." It was not
only a way to take care of the employees, Martin says, but to keep the
entire backlist alive.

Martin also worked out a deal with Ecco where he will edit five
unpublished Bukowski manuscripts. Bukowski has had more work found
posthumously than the Honeymooners - he's already had eight books
released since his death in 1994.-Steven Zeitchik

I find it difficult to accept this argument, although the presentation is
convincing and interests me very much.  Since each poem is idiosyncratic,
ideas in poetics cannot be helpful. Once a poetic idea is "crystallized" it
becomes a "critical thought." Look what happened to the Language School.
What is it that happened to the Language School? A large and growing number
of writers express interest in each others work by writing about each others
work and publishing it. Critics give this process a name called the
"Language School."  Ron Silliman called it a "moment not a movement." I
always liked this comment because I feel it captured something of the
sensibility of the post 60's period that included quite a lot of effort to
avoid exclusion, a lot of effort to reach out nationally and
internationally. Many of these writers still read each others work, write
about each others work and work on projects together over 25 years later. I
think this outcome has much to do with the intellectual climate of exchange
of ideas about poetry and the poetic process, not just works.   It seems
obvious that a lot of the expansive energies- in publishing contemporary
poetry and in the efforts to internationalize connections between writers-
had to do with the serious attention towards issues in poetics discussed by
and among these poets.-In The American Tree- edited by Silliman- which is
available now in a new reprint, had a separate section called Second Front
which consisted of essays in poetics. Andrews and Bernstein's
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E contained only reviews and essays and information on
contemporary poetry with little actual poetry except that contained in work
in poetics, Watten published -Poetics Journal- Bob Perelman published a book
of talks in the area of poetics, to name only a few of the important efforts
in this area. I feel that the work in poetics done during the early years of
the L-A "moment" by so many poets was one of the crucial factors in ushering
in the intense interest in contemporary poetry that has occurred since both
inside and outside of academia, such as the Kootenay school in Canada,
Zasterle press in the Canary Islands and the many anthologies and important
literary relationships that emerged out of the group of French poets
involved in the translation center at Royamont near Paris. Perhaps some
confusion may arise out of the word poetics itself which implies efforts
towards establishing theoretical premises and generalizations as in
Sociology and Anthropology, lets say. While some of this has emerged, it is
my impression that the only clear demarcation line between poetics and
poetry is in the question of address. Poetics is a form of writing that
mimics conversation as much as it mimics theory and the process of creating
poetry itself. I see poetics as a form of conversation between poets about
the poetic process and the poet's lived experience which includes all the
connected physical, emotional, economic, psychological, linguistic,
philosophical, political issues that poets face in their daily lives. These
might start out as primarily intellectual communications, but eventually did
lead and could continue to lead towards discussions having to do with the
career of the poet, the meaning of publication for the poet, what the
critical process has to do with the work of the poet, etc. The critical
emphasis is on texts; I am not questioning the cultural value of literary
criticism or literary theory; I love to read both. But such avenues of
literary discussion do not bear directly on many of the crucial issues that
poets have to contend with in creating a ground for their work. Most of the
valuable work that critics and theorists do create a ground for further work
in criticism and literary theory that advance the value of poetry for
culture on the whole but this rarely contains an advance in the value of
poetry and the poet's career for the poets themselves. There is an aporia
here that now can be addressed only by poets themselves. Creating further
means of transmitting the poetic product itself through readings and
publication increases the scope of the poetic territory and the scope of
this aporia at the same time. This is a paradox that I feel poets can only
face  together. In this context it is important to remember the time when it
was felt that teachers  should be happy to do their work for the good it was
bringing to themselves. It took the union movement to begin the process of
changing this. When will poets learn to use their formidable powers of
expression to help each other and thus themselves? When will poets stop
thinking that because a poetics must be invented for each poem that the
field of poetry must be reinvented with each poem? The immortal isolated
poem remains powerful; the immortal isolated poet remains powerless.

i like this concept.  i'd also say that not just "POETS" can participate in
this process...as M.C. Richards said, poets are not the only poets.  i like
to use the terms "poetic activities" or "poetic events" to encompass more
than simply discrete poems; and the loose term "micropoetries" to identify
poetic activity that is either not necessarily self-consciously "poetic" or
that is not generally taken seriously as "poetry" --doggerel, newspaper
verse, found poetry, lullabies, counting-out rhymes, ephemera of all kinds,
etc. etc
as for the below, i've tried to think/write about this disciplinary
slippage in the term "poetics" in a piece called "the poetics of poetry"
which years later is still in a very half-baked state ("in poeisis" wd be
the complimentary term).  i think there is a link between the
current/recent social scientists' infatuation w/ the term and what poets
mean, but it may not be immediately transparent.  i think it has to do w/
attention to a (self-)making process (poeisis) and to a generalized sense
that a culture, like a poem, is a structured though permeable and mutable
entity with some degree of internal logic and some degree of responsiveness
to extra-cultural or intercultural flows and pressures.

I'm not surprised at all about how much Bukowski sells.

I hung out in a Philly bar last October, a bar recommended by Linh Dinh.  I
was in Philly for a reading the next day.  Some Joe sat down next to me and
we had a few drinks.  The guy was a cook and said he didn't know "anything"
about poetry, except that he liked Charles Bukowski and owned three of his
books of poetry.  No fiction, just the poems.  Bukowski.  Didn't own any
other poetry.  He remembered ee cummings from high school.

Where I live in NC I socialize a lot, and I have a keen sense of hearing for
when people talk poetry.  Because, let me tell you, it's a pretty rare
occasion as you can imagine. Just like anywhere else, even in the town where
I live, with the highest density of PhDs in the US.  In the last two months
I've heard exactly two conversations about poetry here in Chapel Hill.
(Which is an unusually high rate.)  Both involved two males drinking alcohol
and talking specifically about Charles Bukowski's poems.  One of those four
males is a friend of mine.  I know from him that Bukowski's the only poet
he's ever read.  Or understood.  He's said as much.  This friend has a PhD
in Physics.  A pretty smart & well-educated guy.

I will speculate as to Bukowski's success: 1) cult status movie "Barfly"
starring Mickey Rourke; 2) strong association with alcohol as well as the
"natural" (either will capture the "yo dude" quotient so big in this
country, especially in the 18-25 male market); and 3) because of Bukowski's
content, I'd say he and his work are sufficiently "macho" to allow young
heterosexual males to rationalize reading his poetry.  Anyone else's poetry
and they'd be either too "sissy" (or words much worse) or "intellectual."
(For those of you who don't see the subtext here: I'm not endorsing this
point of view!  Oh please no, not even close.  I'm just telling it like I've
seen it.)

These three things add up so powerfully into a cult-of-the-author status Buk
now has.

Buk's going to sell more books at Ecco than he did at Black Sparrow.

While I'm pleased the Black Sparrow backlist is
apparently being taken care of, of course I'm saddened
that some of it is going from the underground of the
undergound up into the Corporate Suites (and the money
from the sales)--

I mean it was so *weirdly unpleasant* (the way a bad
Will Smith film is) when Ecco picked up its *own*
backlist and walked through the doors of
HarperCollins.

Yuck.

But I also want to reiterate a smaller point
(ultimately perhaps more important) that poetry enjoys
a larger status in different cultural
traditions--while Bukowski may be the poet of choice
in the beer-drinking white-guy group, in the Arab and
South Asian cultures and societies many, many poets
are read, spontaneously recited from, quoted, etc--

I can't necessarily speak for the importance of
literature in other non-European groups, but I recall
the famous reprinting the chinese menu in an issue the
mag "Jubilat" the dishes in which were lines of Li
Bai's poetry...

Nick,

The key idea in Ron's comment is "a moment." Language School ideas, at their
moment, constituted a poetics, that is to say, an approach to poetry which
justified, rationalized what a group of poets were doing, created a framework
for the understanding of their work. In that respect, at its moment, language
school poetics was a very energizing, creative movement. The relative success
of the movement within a few years -and their establishment in a few poetry
centers- turned the ideas embedded in it into templates (that is to say,
orthodoxies) of "innovative" writing.

I believe Language school poetics is a hindrance to the younger generations
of poets writing today -even to those who like, appreciate or admire this
poetry. My ideas relate to, speak to that struggle, though in years I am
older than they are. I believe poetry today must find a completely new sets
of references (less French/European, less word/literature bound), more Asian,
more ecclectic, more open to visual arts -poetry not as "expansion" or
"development" of an avant-garde tradition, but a deeper re-orientation, a new
beginning, that is, create a new template.

That is partly my problem, this poetry does not look wide enough, outside its
circle enough; I don't mean that it doesn't attempt to propagate itself,
rather that, its perceptions do not include enough of an "outside."

I disagree with this point of view, the idea that writing poetics is a kind
of poetry itself (as far as I can see, a point of view manufactured by
semiology). In my opinion, a poetics without a body of work backing it (or
from which it emanates) is meaningless.

Remains powerless, in terms of the values of the society surrounding him/her,
which the work counter imagines.


As before, it is a pleasure to argue with you.

i like this idea as well...poetry and poeisis, that is, an ongoing,
permeable, mutable process, open to multiple (global, local,
internal, external, intellectual, physiological, social, elemental)
impulses and inputs, need to be intertwined --need to implicate each
other so deeply that it's hard to distinguish them.  in this sense, i
dont know that a "body of work" can be separated from a "body of
discourse about...", or any other body.

I don't think Patrick's being totally fair to Bukowski or his readers.  I am
female, don't write like him, etc, and still -- his work is good, there is a
lot going on besides the beer. Certainly a much better sense of language AND

i now blush to admit it, but bukowski's poetry meant a lot to me when
i was 16 and starting out.  people would assume, because i was a
"woman"(girl) writing in the 1970s, that my inspirations were sexton
and plath, and they'd kid me, just don't put your head in the oven
haw-haw, you know what happens to women poets.  bukowski and creeley
were my turnons to poetry, baldwin and genet to fiction.  how could i
even talk to those people?

Last night I had the chance to go to a screening of "Mr. Deeds Goes to
Town," not the new Adam Sandler remake, but the 1936 Capra original.
Quite fascinating on several fronts, but Patrick's post on the "macho
factor" in Bukowski's poetry made me think of all the very strange ways
Gary Cooper is "coded" in this picture.  The basic plot of the film is
that a small-town guy (Cooper) inherits a fortune and all sorts of
complications ensue.  The Cooper character is a bow-tie wearing
"poet"-actually, a writer of greeting card verse.  At times, Cooper comes
across as positively "light in the loafers," to invoke the vernacular.
And when his new fortune draws him irresistibly to New York city he is
branded immediately as a naif and object of fun--indeed, he is dubbed The
Cinderella Man (for his overnight transformation), with the film making no
bones about the insult to his manhood implied by the term.  So anyway,
what's interesting is that he is able to make up for all this feminizing
by poking people in the jaw at regular intervals throughout the film.  He
socks a couple of pretentious New York (i.e. high art) poets in the jaw at
a restaurant, pops off on a conniving lawyer, and so on.  The regular
recourse to a right cross is all the more remarkable given that the film
insists throughout, often quite drippily, on the importance of "nice,"
gentle treatment of one's fellow human beings (as opposed to the cynical,
treacherous behavior of most of the big-city denizens populating the
film).

But the film gives us all sorts of other interesting coding as well.
Eventually Cooper winds up at a hearing to determine his sanity, where a
German-accented psychiatrist wheels out a big chart divided into three
horizontal bands or zones labeled subnormal, normal, and abnormal (this
got a big laugh with last night's Cambridge audience).  Sine waves running
through these bands indicate the fluctuations of mood for both "normal
people" and "manic depressives."  The normal fluctuations stay within the
normal zone, of course, but the manic depressive sine wave shows big
swings of mood from the depressed (subnormal) up to the ecstatic
("abnormal" on the chart).  The accusations against Cooper include:
playing the tuba at odd times, feeding donuts to a horse, and wanting to
give away all his millions to poor farmers who have lost their farms
during the Depression.  Writing poetry is not included among the
accusations, but one feels this is an oversight.

Pardonez-moi for jumping in, but I think Murat may be right re:  the success
of langpo as a hindrance to younger poets.  This is nothing new, of course.
Every success exercises a similar hegemony.  The list is as long as literary
history.  Consider in the last century Eliot, Ginsberg, Ashbery as a few such
templates.  But I think the problem, inevitable as it is, goes a bit further.
 Most, if not all, major poetic movements are rooted in Philosophy.  The
langpoets find their philosophical underpinnings in
structuralism/poststructuralism.  Others, past and present, have written upon
various transcendentalisms, idealisms, Hegelianisms, Heideggerianisms.  The
issue now is whether anyone, in good faith, can return to any form of
absolutism now that continental philosophy since the 1970s has reduced such
"beliefs" to ashes (or cinders, for those of you who know the reference).  I
use the word "belief" intentionally since a return at this point would seem
more like a religious gesture based on faith than a philosophical one rooted
in analytical thinking.  There have been attempts in the recent past to link
Eastern philosophies to Quantum theory and Deconstruction, with varying rates
of success.  But said linkage fails to appropriate Asian ideas as a way out.
It merely restores the current hegemony as the West swallows the East, or
vice versa -- doesn't really matter who does the belching if both are one.
So where to?  Another hopeless effort to separate "art" from outside
influences such as philosophy, psychology, etc.?  Even simple, eco-minded
nature poems are webbed within transcendentalism.  I know how I'm working
this out in my own stuff.  What are the rest of you doing, those of you who
feel the need to move on?  Best, Bill

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

it seems to me that there is a lot of goings on on
this list about the purpose or definition of poetics.
it reminds me of a car ride talk  i had with a
philosopher friend about a year ago. i am a  writer
and came to the idea of poetics from this angle, i
thought it could be a statement of process and overall
artistic intent by the writer. a self imposed picking
apart of each step, an unwinding of the threads that
make the text and connect it to the fingers and mind
that let it out. i took a class that used hoover's
postmodern poetry, and it included many poet's poetics
statements and each one seemed to point towards intent
and process as personal. each one seemed to be about
the enjoyment of this wordplay, and the discoveries
that happen in the process.
which brings me to the other form of poetics, like
cixous writing about clarice lispector or anybody
writing on cixous. cixous revels in the possibilities
that the text offers her, the hidden ideas that she
may stumble upon when writing her own piece of text on
the text. nothing definitive goes on here. things are
suggested and gestured towards. cixous discovers her
own writing through lispector, she dicscovers
lispector and she finds ways, creates ways to pull the
words into her own philosophy, finds pieces of
lispector in there and weaves words into her own work
of art, one that is not traditional criticism, one
that is poetics.
i have a definition that i would hope poetics could
stand up to. i would hope that it could help break the
odd border between writing that is so artificial it
hardly stands.im  not sure exactly how it would work
but i would hope that criticism, fiction, poetry and
philosophy could engage as the similar texts they are,
and be recognised as similar text, as writing as
discovery, as similar languages of change. not to keep
going on about cixous, but doesn't she do this
perfectly? isnt her "fiction" philosophy poetics
poetry and even politics all at the  same time (you
can find her shelved all over the place in
bookstores)?
...just some thoughts, ive been on this list for
awhile and never posted, heres my unsolicited two
cents.

I agree: probably with a lot of men this tough-guy thing or image hides a
lot of feelings and as you say with C Buk. "there's a lot more going on". He
reminds me in a very round about way of Coover and also strangely of James
Tate... Richard.

Jessica--Thanks for posting!  Lost of interesting stuff here.  I too have
found it interesting the way the recent "poetics" thread (hey, the
poetics list is actually talking about poetics!) has often insisted
on a clear split between "criticism" and "poetry" when a lot of recent
work (last 30 years or so) so obviously wants to question this
divide.

The coexistence in discussion of these two unlikely
strands interests me. A kind of spectrum of needs
ranging from a fairly basic, projected interpersonal
connection in the dim light of Bukowski texts to what
one might perceive as a complex level of (possible)
communion about intentionality and so forth (poetics).

Either end of the spectrum may pose challenges for
participants. Bukowski at his most raw is tedious, and
poetics venturing into the ether at the possible
expense of poetry may be unendurable in very different
ways.

At their best, either pole may provide richness. The
tenderness of Bukowski at those rare moments ("Linda,
you brought it to me, and when you take it away, do it
slowly . . ." (loosely paraphrased from memory) - from
the volume Mockingbird Wish Me Luck, I believe).
Poetics at its most vital is replete with riches that
seem to last abundantly for those who engage in it.
And for lurkers, one supposes.

It's interesting to talk of what works and what
doesn't work in poetics, and some fixed positions that
people may hold relative to the place of created
works, process-based conversation and that combination
of the two (as in Artifice of Absorption by Charles
B). I find it easy to get blissfully lost in a
beautiful combo text. It matters not that this is not
a universal feeling.

I do enjoy hearing what works for various people on
the list.

Bill,

Has LS poetics envisaged anything which goes beyond the prescriptions of
English Empiricism, Wittgenstein being the reductive limit of this empiricism?

You suggest that turning to a new direction would be more like a "religious
gesture" than "analytic thinking." Exactly, since going around, discarding
analytic philosophy is, to me, one main impetus of the discussions of the
last few weeks. For example, sufism, which is a political mysticism
(mysticism, an absolute no-no for an empiricist or a deconstructionist or a
semiologist), embodies a way of thinking, of imagining (embodies a poetics)
which goes out of the framework we are facing. One shouldn't forget that a
lot of radical thinking in the world today is perceived in religious terms.

i'm eating chips and writing poems.  am i rooted in transcendentalism.  how
about incidentalism?  in terms of moving beyond, getting past, every minute
we're past language poetry with or without the equal signs.  but why set it
up in terms of lineage?  why the dualism of before and after?  the trace of
tradition?  it hapened, is happening and will happen.  then as if there is a
central frog in the pond that has caused these con(ec)centric circles
outwards, life as if theory only showed people how they can't write anymore.
  not even web-like, there is no materiality to this interconnectedness
(weak).  in the past aggressive breakages signalled a move forward.  but
there are so many problems with this.  progressivity, fear of 'fathers',
passionate political opposition, identity as alter-, etc and etc, et al.  no
movement has ever been forward.

              The Question of Entrance

         to understand what things meant would be tragic. A failure of =
nervousness. I        cant gesticulate enough. Ape me you. Thus I. =
Disastrous. A bolt. About this time the green and blue music entered on =
harrying tip toe to a grandstand cacophony as if a nation had been =
slaughtered. Reality kept on: we couldnt fix that, but there were =
pressing intrusions. I want you: you want. He wants, she wants, they =
want. Everyone wants. There is a heaviness

blacks the land. What is it with you? It's...Christ it's getting hot. =
Plant something. Are they caming?  Will they be caming? What's that? =
Who's this? And so on as a thousand vermilion vermin settled in. Ours of =
course to laud and chuckle over as the chairs rock unattended and vacant =
of personas. The wind, apropos of nowt, whips the air and all become =
involved in the drama with the chilling fingers and maybe the Laocoon. =
The death that young men yearn for. They keep wandering. A hundred =
thousand died last week and things are everywhere. And they flash or =
wink in a violent opposition of clangs, bangs, and clashes of =
shatter-light. All this and more: and still more, setting store and we =
are thus bereft to consider the clammy cells and the days of April: the =
days of yore when petrol pingle pangled out of Big Tree Cans until you =
fucked with various heads, fucker.=20

But all this is much more than it is. In fact it is much more than more =
than what it is. Much much more you whore. All this being more: I being =
you and you seeking me and us as we seek you and indeed ever shall into =
endless edges. The great sea turns white. And why shouldnt it?  Nothing =
is. And yet the Thing playing about his frontage had sleight. Some sort =
of lusty legerdemain. Les Main Sales. They are. It all started with: =
"You dirty boy." The house leaked like a palindrome; but never =
completely as if a savage and incomprehensible music (nationality or =
race unknown or irrelevant) was and did deep-guide her quick hand, and =
the subject of gluttony shifted, till one, flicking back a strand of =
hair, scraped back her chair and vanished by virtue of defaulted =
surprise. We linguists. I, by the way, am that to be and verify.

Subject: poetics as discovery

it seems to me that there is a lot of goings on on
this list about the purpose or definition of poetics.
it reminds me of a car ride talk  i had with a
philosopher friend about a year ago. i am a  writer
and came to the idea of poetics from this angle, i
thought it could be a statement of process and overall
artistic intent by the writer. a self imposed picking
apart of each step, an unwinding of the threads that
make the text and connect it to the fingers and mind
that let it out. i took a class that used hoover's
postmodern poetry, and it included many poet's poetics
statements and each one seemed to point towards intent
and process as personal. each one seemed to be about
the enjoyment of this wordplay, and the discoveries
that happen in the process.
which brings me to the other form of poetics, like
cixous writing about clarice lispector or anybody
writing on cixous. cixous revels in the possibilities
that the text offers her, the hidden ideas that she
may stumble upon when writing her own piece of text on
the text. nothing definitive goes on here. things are
suggested and gestured towards. cixous discovers her
own writing through lispector, she dicscovers
lispector and she finds ways, creates ways to pull the
words into her own philosophy, finds pieces of
lispector in there and weaves words into her own work
of art, one that is not traditional criticism, one
that is poetics.
i have a definition that i would hope poetics could
stand up to. i would hope that it could help break the
odd border between writing that is so artificial it
hardly stands.im  not sure exactly how it would work
but i would hope that criticism, fiction, poetry and
philosophy could engage as the similar texts they are,
and be recognised as similar text, as writing as
discovery, as similar languages of change. not to keep
going on about cixous, but doesn't she do this
perfectly? isnt her "fiction" philosophy poetics
poetry and even politics all at the  same time (you
can find her shelved all over the place in
bookstores)?
...just some thoughts, ive been on this list for
awhile and never posted, heres my unsolicited two
cents.

Don't know whether or not I'm clanging or chiming with Nick and=20
Murat.  Nick sees poetics as leading to the poet's empowering, and Murat=20
feels, especially with "Language Poetry," the burden of  prior=20
poetics.  Here are a couple of further excerpts from my longer "Aspects of=
=20
Poetics" which muse around the issues.  The first part of the piece is=20
posted at www.culturalsociety.org . (the second half is yet to be posted):

(By "poetics," I'm thinking of one of the basic ways we take this word when=
=20
applied to poetry, a proposal, a manifesto, a theory....)

Proust sets the tone for these meditations with his comment that "a work in=
=20
which there are theories is like an object which still has its price tag on=
=20
it." To the extent that a poetics is a theory and that the poetry it=20
generates shows forth theory or method through key tropes such as=20
foregrounding the device or making strange or via programmatic or=20
formalistic procedures, including so-called traditionalist ones =97 choose=
=20
your implement =97 then price tags are pretty ubiquitous. They tell poetry=
=20
consumers, before the fact, what it is they are about to read and poetry=20
writers what it is they are about to write.
Admittedly, poetics is a beclouded field. Responding to an earlier version=
=20
of this paper, the poet Devin Johnston asked about the "slippage of the=20
term 'poetics' between a statement or reflection on the generating=20
principles of one's poetry" and "something like ideology." Johnston says=20
"plenty of poets do not write a poetics but only write poems." About the=20
slippage, I'd say my emphasis here is more on poetics as ideology. As to=20
Johnston's referring to poets who "only write poems," my response is that=20
underlying his phrase is the difficulty, even pain, and uncertainty of=20
poetic composition. I don't believe we can say with any surety that poets=20
"only write poems," for such a notion of innocent composition flies in the=
=20
face of what we do know: that each of us are products of traditions, of=20
wars with traditions, impulses and hopes, and that we are informed,=20
inhabited, guided, even unconsciously, by such traditions and psychologies.
But I am not arguing determinism here. I'm only saying that if we look back=
=20
we will see that there is a place or places we come from, and that by this=
=20
looking back, seeing the traditions that inform us rather than being=20
unconsciously driven by them, we will have achieved the first act of poetic=
=20
freedom.

.....

Another unintended aspect of poetics is that it sets up a hidden opposition=
=20
between dogma and craft. As a rule-driven guide to composition, poetics may=
=20
in fact dilute the poetic impulse even as it strives to maintain poetry's=20
timeliness (sometimes fashionable timeliness). Alice Notley, for example,=20
complains: "I want to stand face to face with whatever reality there is and=
=20
I feel that all the friendly theoreticians in my neighborhood are keeping=20
me from doing this by proclaiming that there is no such reality as is made=
=20
evident in the works of so and so philosopher or poet." Notley, with some=20
humor, is echoing Derrida's call for "the freedom to schematize without=20
concept." To the extent that a poetics is primarily dictatorial by invoking=
=20
rules and strictures on what constitutes a poem, it modifies or even=20
attenuates the powers of the imagination, at least in its Coleridgian=20
formulation of "intuitive knowledge" or " immediate presence." Poetics in=20
this fashion is occult: the poet buys the Lotto ticket of occulted dogma=20
with its promise of poetic riches and potential for recognition by the=20
clerisy (academe).
To embrace a poetics is to embrace a future-looking dynamic. I am referring=
=20
here to the a priori nature of most poetics. As with the mystical blank=20
page of the writing workshop, a theory about how to construct a poem=20
beckons to the poet like an unappeased hunger demanding satisfaction,=20
demanding that its conception of poetic activity be filled or demonstrated=
=20
with words and images.

I've just started to follow this thread and the point below by Ravi Shankar
makes sense:of course the author is not dead: but we may be (or perhaps
already are) seeing a cooperative collaborative activity - as long as thats
is not
seen as the only method or process of production: if the analogy eg to
capitalist or any other productive and economic system is made, we have
had/do have an dispoportionate and an overt emphasis on the individual: but
in reality even capatalistic production requires an enormous amount of
cooperative interaction: as do in fact all human edeavours: albeit that
within certain conditions there is room for the individual -  and that as
Ravi says "means more life for the text" but of course the other side re
what was said of
Lowell and Beckett and the death wish, nihilism etc is also quite
interesting/valid: I'm seeing this "argument"in the way that Auden began to
write as in "The Orators" which I am currently studying: of course that
wasnt his first work but here the author is fragmented (or the psyche of his
"alter ego" (and its problematic ow much Auden is the"pure" artist here and
or how much he's (legitimately of course) playing a subtle game, or how much
is himself and hence how much of his mythical-real-self seen-"blurred
image"-self the poem is about and how much that Self is an image of England
and the World then given the rise of Nazism and other issues in the 1930s:
the poem is quite extraordinary, and ranges from being an "objective" study
of society and the socious, to questions of morality,death, identity,
Freudian and other
questions: but it holds a dark beauty. Auden also "quotes" and incorporates
into the text Gertrude Stein or Steinic writing at one point. Stein was a
writer he  had admired after she lectured in England in the mid or late
twenties. So it is a complex work: a proto-multi-vocal thing if one likes or
pleases. That said it is perhaps only analogous of the state of the mind of
people and of "hero worship" but it becomes a performance of some
subtlety...and stylistically and in terms of its very layout and form etc it
even anticipates Olson or  some of the "moves" of the language poets: the
author is Auden: but the "story" is the world, the human mind, the darkness
and the light...(I wish I had begun lit earlier in life there is so much I
havent covered: I have only ever known collections of Auden, and wish that I
had read more of Swinburne and even Whitman) and so was Whitman: strange
(forgetting for now Auden and Whitman's sexual orientation) that he was so
vituperated: he is suggesting that the "Song of Himself" is the song of all
people (of course that he was a homosexual must have been known to the
critics, hence their anger: but it was also the strangeness or, to them, the
unfamiliarity of his technique to them: but how would they evaluate him?
(critics be warned! We need to be very considerate (for we are all both
creators and critics): I mean that the consider in considerate AND our
respect for anyone working in literature be maintained (hence my compliment
recentlly was wrongly spurned, (result of critical critonoia?) oh well) -
Swinburne later repudiated his initial interest and affirmation to Whitman:
things were too dangerous then as he also distanced himself from Oscar
Wilde)  - but the idea of the author "opting " out is clearly disturbing to
many people, possibly it began with _ such as_ Whitman (possibly this
reaction to "newness" recurs forever (as in the riot at the first
performance of The Rite of  Spring): but, as to how deceased I am or you are
my dear reader: I/we might say "take my words" but I/we wouldnt ever concur
to "take all my/our work and call it yours" but it is a fact that we can all
get into the "genius trap", the Great I Conundra, the Joyce of FW trap
(again maybe the death wish thing here?) ...we dont have to die (as authors:
mind you it IS true that we  all die) ....but recognise that - individuals
yeah we are - we are very much in a widened world: film certainly shows the
way: the working class are both freed and corrupted by film videos popular
culture and so on: the beautiful faes....but/and the death of the author
concept has overtones, troubling, insidious murmers indeed, that it is
possible that those who control the strings might be challenged, even
usurped, destroyed maybe. It is also interesting the way that we - in
conjunction with Bathes's concept - think of the death of Berryman and say
Celan, and Lowell's near nihilism and Beckett's comic, almost nihilistic
creations eg of Endgame or Just I (and maybe indirectly the Derek and Clive
tapes of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook) and link it to "the death of the
author". Barthes challenges intellectuals (and in France I suppose he
challenged the "authorities" .. if any authorities or paters took any notice
...and encouraged those stuck in hieratic positivities to maybe "open
up"....  fun and games.  Ludo ludere lusi lusum = to play.

How then to evaluate? It becomes circular like the "chase of signifiers" but
I think we all know that certain fundamentals remain: the fragmentaion of a
text (an anonymous multi vocal and multi-mediac text ) is still a
challenging
possible looming there or heere, or somehwere...its coming, whatever it is:
such a work with the possiblity that anyone's contribution of whatever formn
and in whatever order is equally valid can I think be a liberating
possiblity to people: the text can become "open" and "user friendly" but
also it can be  as challenging and or as difficult as anyone wants: there
are no rules (as in life) but yet - life
does impose rules if you want to survive  and be happy  (or at least
operative): the idea of "quality" is challenged in favour of participation:
the idea of fixed orders and levels of people is challenged against the
ruling class's deep need (still -today) to divide and alienate the people:
it is possibly a bomb going off signalling the possibility that everyone
_does _ have something to contribute: potentially a world closer to a
cooerative,egalitarian...yes: an utopian society; but of course this is only
one aspect of the dialectic...it is implied (surely?) that the individual
still will wish, and love, to make  her/his "stamp": an ongoing struggle OUR
kempf, the kempf of us all not that of evil and or greedy men. I say men.
  And it is true that we ae near to a "post-ownership ontology that has not
fully pervaded our sensibilities" ..I agree with that. But are _post_
ownership: we will never be totlaly: onership in the BIG sense IS being
cahllenged (paradoxically when writers want to collect more royalties
etc)..even if we willlnever be post ownership as such. Ownership is not
undesirable in itself. But poetry as discussion,as sharednes, as openning
up, as
possiblity: this is both "old news " ...yet:

it is new news...

Of course there is no right and wrong conclusion to these things: it is
always or
should always be a discussion: maybe one that is unending.   Richard Taylor

as i read the successive posts on these discussions,
plus the content discussion, plus Bukowski, etc etc I
keep coming back and back to Rae Armantrout's poems.

they so powerfully exemplify a poetic practice that
addresses, solves, resolves, dissolves, devolves, etc
a lot of these issues we are talking about.

i could go on and on about it in quite an intelligent
way, but it seems actually counterproductive. remember
also it was the boston review essay on her work that
started the original firestorm about poetry/criticism
a couple of months ago.

maybe i'll write more on this later--

Wouldn't this depend on how one defines 'forward'?  How do you define it?

Dear Susan,

I celebrated Steve Dickison's birthday with him his wife, and Chris Daniels
the other night, and Steve showed me your postcard collage (with the truck
coming out of the card like the bat out of hell), which he hopes to reproduce
in the next issue of Shuffleboil. Good. It's funny, I realize just this
minute, because (for Christmas) I made a collage for him in which a caravan of
rhythmic pillows from a Smith & Hawken catalog replaced a convoy of trucks in
a foud photo of a godforsaken spot in Iran—

I have a notebook for your collages and all they inspire– I am taking it with
me to Marfa, Texas, net week, where I am to spend ten days under Lannan
auspices. I mean to have something to give back to you some time– Have you
ever been to Marfa?  I am terrified to go. Afraid to be away from Isabel for
so long, in wide open spaces, in a small town, in the heat. Also excited.

I now have a whole series of NYC/WTC collages on disk and am looking for some
place to show them this fall. Do you have any ideas? I think they would make a
good strange small show, and I hope to write a brief essay about them (and the
process of seeking, finding, and pasting) while I am in Marfa.

Chris Daniels (don't know if you know him) is someone I see at many poetry
parties and readings out here. He has an amazing reading voice and his thing
is: translations of Brazilian poetry. Manifest Press, subsidized well by the
Haas Foundation, is publishing a translation of his next year, and he is
looking for some subsidy now so he can go back to Brazil and do some more
translations. I have given him your email address because you always have good
ideas, and because you are involved in PEN and they do give translation
grants, I think. Expect to hear from him and to have pleasure reading his
translations.

How are you? Tell me exactly.

Love,

Linda

Subject: Jazz Bass legend Ray Brown passes
Date: Wed, 3 Jul 2002 14:40:33 -0500

July 3, 2002

Greetings Jazz88 E-Newshounds,

We are very sorry to report that Jazz Bass legend (and long time
friend to KBEM) Ray Brown passed Tuesday night at the age of 75.
According to Jim Wilke (host of "Jazz After Hours" on PRI) Ray's trio
was in Indianapolis to play Monday and Tuesday at the Jazz Kitchen.
Apparently Ray, an ardent golfer, had played Tuesday in the hot sun
and had gone back to the hotel to rest before the gig. When he didn't
show for the gig, they checked at the hotel and he was gone.

The trio was to play dates in Germany after the current midwest
dates, and then 3 weeks in Japan...typical of Ray Brown's tour
schedules that were grueling even for players a third of his age.

Ray Brown was much more than a bass player and band leader. He was an
inspiration to many, giving encouragement (and employment) to people
like Gene Harris and Ernestine Anderson whose careers had waned in
later years.

(From the All Music Guide to Jazz, Miller Freeman Books, San
Francisco, 1994)...
A steady, consistently excellent technician, Ray Brown's precise
fluid sound has backed numerous vocalists, and has contributed to
trios, duos, quartets, quintets and big bands since the '40s. Brown
was generally regarded as the most swinging bassist to hire for a
rhythm section.

He moved to New York from Pittsburgh in 1945 and was immediately
involved in the emerging bebop revolution. He recorded with Charlie
Parker, Dizzy Gilespie, and Bud Powell while playing in Gillespie's
big band in 1946 and 1947. He became Ella Fitzgerald's music director
(as well as her husband) in the late '40s and worked with her until
1952.  Brown played with an early edition of what became the Modern
Jazz Quartet, recording with the Milt Jackson Quartet in 1951. He
subsequently joined Oscar Peterson's trio, which ranked among jazz's
most popular combos of the '50s and '60s. Ray was voted top bassist
consistently in critics polls during the decade of the '50s. Brown
proved the ideal partner for Peterson's swirling, intricate solos.
The Peterson/Brown/Herb Ellis lineup stayed intact until 1957, and
Brown remained with Peterson until 1966. There were also albums for
Verve, with Kenny Burrell, Hank Jones, Milt Jackson, big bands, and
even with gospel singer Marion Williams.

During the '70s, Brown became affiliated with the Pablo and Concord
record labels( which led to two duet albums with pianist Jimmie
Rowles, nine albums as part of the L.A. Four, and a magnificent
recording with Duke Ellington..."This One's for Blanton" dedicated to
the legendary bassist Jimmy Blanton).
Brown continued recording at Concord in the '80s. In the late '80s,
Brown formed a trio with pianist Gene Harris and drummer Mickey Roker
and toured extensively. In the 1990s, Brown initiated an affiliation
with Telarc, recording several projects for Telarc including the
"Some of My Best Friends Are..." Series and "Superbass" and
"Superbass 2". Ray's latest Telarc release is "Some of My Best
Friends Are...Guitarists", featuring guitarists Russel Malone,John
Pizzarelli,Herb Ellis,Ulf Wakenius,Kenny Burrell and Bruce Forman.
This project includes "Soulful Spirit" a lovely track dedicated to
the late Billy Higgins, featuring guitarist Kenny Burrell.

Ray Brown was active in artist management and concert promotion for
many years. He helped revive Ernestine Anderson's career in the mid
'70s and assisted her in landing a deal with Concord Records. He
managed Quincy Jones, and for years produced concerts at the
Hollywood Bowl.  He published several bass instruction books.

Ray Brown had been scheduled to appear at the Dakota Bar and Grill in
St. Paul on July 22nd.

Tune in to "The Cruise with Kevin O'Connor" this afternoon from 3 pm
to 7 pm. Kevin will be featuring several tracks from Ray's
discography. Friday, July 5th, the Classic Jazz Hour from noon to 1
p.m. will be dedicated to Ray Brown and "Monday Evening Jazz with Tom
Surowicz" (Monday evening 8 to 11 p.m.) will undoubtedly highlight
Ray's career.

All of us at KBEM will miss the wonderful musical spirit Ray Brown
brought to Jazz!

For more info on Ray Brown, discography, etc., visit www.telarc.com

Thanks for tuning in and have a safe 4th of July!

One style available to younger poets is fragmentary lyricism.  Susan Howe
established this mode in works like "Silence Wager Stories," and its
principles have been imitated by dozens of younger writers.  Basically, the
style uses diction to override syntax.  The poet may lyricize at the level
of individual words, but must avoid syntax that suggests a straighforward
expression of feeling.  In other words, the power and strangeness of lyric
is separated from the personality of its author and confined to bits of
conventionally "lyric" diction.  These bits are usually held together by
intriguing sound effects.  Thus Howe can write (at the end of
"Rückenfigur"): "Lyric over us love unclothe / Never forever whoso move."
Imagine trying to use the words "love" or "forever" in a speech-based lyric
poem.  Impossible.  But by being fragmentary the lyrical experimentalist
can wax well-nigh romantic.

Lissa Wolsak is skilled in this mode.  She can mimic the Howe-style vatic
swoon, using diction such as "sorrow" and "silence" and "o."  But her more
characteristic attitude toward language seems to be that of a collector.
In her writing, she shows off her odds and ends, some of which she enjoys
for their kitsch value while others are presented earnestly.  Formally,
this results in a style that is accretive and tonally mixed, rather than
finished and coherent.  _Pen Chants_ is basically a collection of jottings
which could have gone on for 500 pages.  Here is page 43:

and after,

istle, finochio, ixia

"rich in apples"

they, for emissive

lips cooled forth

chilled persimmon sheathes,

disinterest in the speech of

ill-lit, rigor-like

ink flows on top of milk

untroubled and smiling an

Engai cuts the tail

from a living lion

The insertion of blank lines between the lines of verse accentuates a
fragmentation that is already palpable in the first line, with its Poundian
copula.  Then comes a string of words and phrases with minimal syntactic
tissue.  The second line ("istle, finochio, ixia") is the verbal equivalent
of someone's rock collection.  The third is a bit of found lyricism, safely
enclosed in quotes.  Then the style becomes consciously mellifluous,
paratactic, with two crisp images: Pound again.  The final image of the
tail-ectomy seems intended to leave the reader in a stunned hush, though
why the poem should conclude with this image is unknown.  Diction does all
the work up until then.  And the intended effect is clearly lyrical: lips
cooled by chilled fruit, the "wondrous" image of ink floating on milk, the
violence of the Engai (a Masai deity, I believe).  Yet we are left unsure
about the poet's own relation to these bits and pieces (an uncertainty we
never feel in Howe's work, or Pound's).  Is this collection meant to be
kitschy?  Or impressive?  Fragmentary lyricism keeps us guessing, while the
poet gets to have her persimmons and eat them too.

I was chatting to someone the other day about my secondary school englit

The students had a sort of an excuse. They didn't know enough and yet still
had to deal with people who had power over them saying "Write me 1500 words

   The B.E.P.C. is a reference guide to the work of contemporary British
poets from the parallel tradition. Launched in May 2002, it will provide
information on poets and their publications, and audio files to accompany
examples of their work. The site is particularly dedicated to increasing the
understanding of the role of oral performance in this poetry, and will be
supported by research projects on the history and theory of performance.
B.E.P.C. is the result of collaboration between three research groups:
Contemporary Poetics Research Centre in the School of English and Humanities
at Birkbeck College; the Poetic Practice Group at Royal Holloway; and
Cultural Poetics in the Department of English, University of Southampton.
The site has been devised by the poet scholar Bill Griffiths, in conjunction
with Robert Hampson, Peter Middleton and Will Rowe.

Lawrence--An interesting critique.  Would you be able to offer a more
"open" reading of this, or some other, poem?  Or do you object to the idea
of "close reading" period?  That is, do you think all "close reading" is
"closed," or just that Andrew has done a particularly bad job of it?

|  Would you be able to offer a more
| "open" reading of this, or some other, poem?

Re this book /  poem / set of poems, and it is, I believe, all of those, I
am *hoping to provide a reading of my own. (Whether it is any better than
that which I am criticising remains to be seen. My ability to write a more
open reading is surely not a precondition for thinking that another's
reading is poor)

I have had the book for review for some time. There are many reasons, most
of  them boring except to me, why I am behind in reviewing - and it's not a
thing I do a lot of; but I have found it difficult to articulate what I feel
about the _pen chants_ and have put it on one side more than once to return
to - fatal!

I *shall get there but I wish that I had moved faster. It is no longer
Wolsak's latest and I was more interested in drawing attention to it than in
putting on record my unimportant take

It was my admiration for  _pen chants_, and for Wolsak's poetry in general
and particular, which made me focus on the posting. I was interested to see
what another had to say

  Or do you object to the idea
| of "close reading" period?  That is, do you think all "close reading" is
| "closed,"

I am very much in favour of close reading. I use the phrase myself, without
intending to claim it as mine, in a piece I wrote about Maggie O'Sullivan.
For what that's worth you can find it, or could, at NACIP

| or just that Andrew has done a particularly bad job of it?

that was my position, is my position

Anyone's entitled not to like the book.

Generally I try to keep quiet when I don't like a book of poetry. There is
so much
that I want to praise, generally I would rather concentrate on that

but I shouldn't object to people giving their reasons though I am surprised
they have the energy

Hatchet jobs can have a disastrous effect upon the poet hatcheted and should
not be lightly undertaken.  I think we owe to each other, if we are going to
attack a piece of work - and this *was an attack - to do it well; and I do
not think this was done at all well

Thanks for replying, Lawrence.  I'd certainly be interested in seeing your
review when it's done, and I'm sure others wld too, so do let us know.  I
don't know Wolsak's poetry, but am curious...

Hi all,

I've recently heard from an old college friend who's looking for some
kind of poetry reading/writing group in Chicago.

If anyone has any suggestions, please post to the list or back
channel & I'll forward them to him.

Bests,

Nick,

     It seems to me that this moves in two important directions..  One as
you point out is the 'need' to
construct hierarchies so one can either thrive within them or battle against
them.  This by it's very nature leads to the "schooling of poets" - 'we
younger poets....", etc...which is of course the way the world is and always
was and will be, but I wonder how productive this direction is?  - I would
suspect that the initial adoption of a persona does initially lead to
productive work but there is a limit to this I would suspect and those on
the list who teach might have some insight into this.

The other direction I have been mulling here relates i think more to poetry
as it could be done and play in a fruitful direction.  Due to circumstances
(and inclination!) I have been spending a lot of time recently with my
garnddaughter who just turned one last week.  Our play does seem to be
developing some rules but the curious thing I've noticed is that the 'rules'
seem to come from me - I'm thinking here of things like reciprocity and
'instruction' - she falls on her a__ and then with time and a little
assistance she learns she can pick herself up again and comes right back at
me for food and water.  This might be an idiosyncratic digression but it
seems to me relevant to the topic here.

I think this segues into Winnicott's squiggle game?

-----
yet another direction this moves in is [poet and reader] vis-a-vis the world
and society as richard notes in his reading of Auden: "the "story" is the
world, the human mind, the darkness and the light."  and I ponder what I
relate to my granddaughter of the world she's entered.

I think it's here that poetics moves into the sphere that Murat and Michael
Heller want to take it, that of rhetoric and 'poetic' thinking as Lawrence
Upton's comments on the rhetorical 'WAFFLE' point -> There is, for example
Bukowski and hundreds of Bukowskiites.

 I take 'poetics' to mean, in contexts such as this, the theory of writing

poetry are not a kind of poetry the question is what kind of writing are
they? They aren't scholarly articles or critical reviews, and they aren't
'about' poetry in the sense of being 'secondary' texts about 'primary' texts
(bodies of work). They are themselves bodies of work about bodies of work,
'about' in the sense that their 'emanation' is an enactment of the relation.
This understanding of poetics texts is not peculiar to L= writing, on the
contrary; it is implicit in manifesto texts, from early last century, in
'Projective Verse',as it is in the poetics texts of Bruce Andrews shall we
say. This understanding may not make them kinds of poems, any more than
their refusual of 'secondariness' renders the primary texts of some
post-structuralist 'theorists' poetry, but it does mark their difference.

Murat Etal. I think that it depends on how you define poetry: I can see a
kind of writing that is eg Scot Hamilton's "poessays" are interesting, but I
currently have Nick Piombino's book (latest) and it combines a kind of
poetic practice with what is at one level or  is seen in at least one way is
poetics or at least philosophising about poetry and language: and this is
not unique to Language Poets.  I read a book about Geoffrey Hill and its
author saw the analogies of the poetic practice to "external events" (what
seemed to me to be 'about" a roof and a man working on it was about making a
poem and so on...(I didnt find the connection easy myself however))...maybe
that's not poetics or even near it but the book, say Bernstein's "A
Poetics", as Wystan says, becomes a text about (hence "connected" to) the
poet's work/works:hence maybe that's  why it's in a "poetic form" in places
to emphasise this cross-copulation of genres or writing practices... in fact
in many forms...there are now since the language poetry movement many more
possibilities of what poetry is and what language can do: we can still read
poetry sans theory, or sans "overt" theory...most people do..but there is
always maybe an implied theoretical view: even if its not our own... a lover
of W Worth's "Daffodils" (which is still a good  if not a great poem) would
maybe stop there: his "theory" wont allow "meaningless" or difficult
stuff...that's enough for him or her: to him Bruce Andrews eg isnt a poet;
he's appears to be mad or ..well: it is full of swear words and strange
things and something about commerce and politics: things that "dont belong"
in a poem.... and it doesnt rhyme and so on...others want to get into the
meat of things: Bruce Andrews  and whoever else is "difficult" they can dig
as much as WW or Keats...many ways to dissect a pineapple. Richard.

Here's a few sentences from Verena Andermatt Conley's forward to the English
translation of Catherine Clement's _Syncope: The Philosophy of Rapture_
(University of Minnesota Press, 1994):

"...Clement targets the century-old philosophical Western practice of
establishing a full subject in philosophical terms one with the advent of
metaphysics, the division between subject and object, and the demise of woman
as well as nature. This practice eliminates from its purview anything that
approaches even in the slightest a vanishment, a gap, or a swoon of meaning
that Clement calls the _syncope_.  This term, which applies to symptoms as
diverse as sneezing, laughing, asthma, or epileptic seizure, is borrowed from
music: 'The queen of rhythm, syncope  is also the mother of _dissonance_; it
is the source, in short, of a harmonious and productive discord...Attack and
haven, collision; a fragment of the beat disappears, and of this
disappearance, rhythm is born.'"
Substitute Wolsak's name for Clement's.  _Pen Chants_ is  _syncopated_ poetry
of great verve and elegance.

I'd like to scrutinize that essay, too, Lawrence, when it gets written.

A selection from Wolsak's earlier The Garcia Family Co-Mercy (Tsunami
Editions, 1994) is on-line at:
http://www.speakeasy.org/subtext/poetry/wolsak/poem1.htm

Readers may also want to be exposed to her freestanding short poems "Noyade"
(Front magazine, Summer 1990), "Orchard Sutra" (Barscheit, Winter 1991),
"Fistnotes" (Lounge broadside, 1995) and "Figmental" (Gorse Press broadside,
1996; reprinted in Matrix 50 [1997]: 54).

On a similar note, a friend from Cuba is in Chicago now
and is interested in attending poetry events in English
and/or Spanish.  His interests range pretty widely, so
any suggestions would be welcome.

well, i've got a little magnifying glass and the compact edition of the
oed...

forward:

1.  to help or push forward; to advance, assist, hasten, romote, urge on.
also, to put forward, set in motion.

2.  to accelerate the growth of (plants, etc.)

3.  to send forward, to send to an ulterior destination (a thing rarely a
person).  in commercial language often loosely, to dispatch, send by some
regular mode of conveyance.

4.  bookbinding.  to get (a sewed book) ready for the 'finisher' by putting
a plain cover on.

prologue:

in isolation forward isn't a troublesome word.  at this late capitalist
juncture though i think of forward as the direction of every sentence toward
a recuperable product.  forward=this idea of progress.  and progress is the
goal of productivity.  bigger better fallout from the 1980s.  barthes says
in his essay at the end of phillipe sollers Event: a novel, "every sentence
is a small narrative."  this implies sentences have a set direction for
understanding even when their structure may disrupt linearity.  we
understand forwards.  even where we understand something like a rhizomic
structure we understand first the rhizome and move forward.  sentences
enforce this direction.  narratives progress.  we aim at sense as a
recuperable product from the start of any project no matter how disparate
the impetus.  desire, whatever, need, necessity, communication depends on
misfires.  things, edges that poke out from rigidified language structures
to connect two sentences together because i can only tell you what i'm
telling you in one way:  the way of this telling at this time.  and you can
only understand in one way at a time.  the space between sentences is
swarmed with hope for connection.  even understanding in retrospect is a
type of movement forward though it is considered a reversal against a larger
paradigm of the progression of absolute time.  looking back is a relative
forward movement from a person's position since the action of reading is
always a forward movement through sentences.  even words are forward
oriented.  from start to finish.

Michael,

I do not want to speak for Nick but wish to respond to your characterization
of my position. "The burden of prior poetics" has the hint of "anxiety of
influence." I was writing before LS emerged, wrote during its ascendancy and
am writing now. Those familiar with my work know that it has a continuity
through the years. In other words, the idea of LS constituting a "prior
poetics" does not apply. A number of years ago Charles Bernstein and I
exchanged letters where some of the issues were discussed. On my part, I
concluded that a convergence of our points of view was essentially
impossible, which indirectly, along with my other concerns, led me to the
writing of the essay, "Questions of Accent."

My disagreement and rejection of analytic philosophy, specifically of
Wittgenstein, goes back to 1962 (I was trained in it). Through the years I
developed a counter argument (counter poetics?) based on W. Benjamin
(particularly his essays on photography and translation), the practices of
turkish poetry and the sensibility it embodied and my take on sufism.

My issue is not my fear of LP influencing me (while one of its techniques,
punning, has also roots in sufi mysticism and the kabbalah with very
different consequences); but its monopoly of poetic discourse. It is, to me,
a question of power, and of my rejection of its authority because it has
little relation to what, the reality I want to write about. My reference to
younger poets in my last two posts has to do with my sense of convergence
between what they want to do and what I have been trying to do at least the
last twenty-five years, specifically in our political concerns.

Kazim reminded us:

<I keep coming back and back to Rae Armantrout's poems.

they so powerfully exemplify a poetic practice that addresses, solves,
resolves, dissolves, devolves, etc a lot of these issues we are talking
about.
      <snip>
remember also it was the boston review essay on her work that started
the original firestorm about poetry/criticism a couple of months ago.>

I reply:

I seem to remember the discussion starting off with someone writing
how bad they thought the piece on Armantrout was. I just re-read it,
and've decided I think it's a pretty good introduction to her work (for
a general audience). You can go here and read it:

http://bostonreview.mit.edu/BR27.2/burt.html

This piece, by Stephen Burt (he's the guy who wrote that stuff on
Elliptical poets I was asking about a while back as well), makes a
good companion to Ron Silliman's introduction to her selected poems
(_Veil_, Wesleyan 2001), a book I think everyone should own two
copies of.

     A snip from his introduction:

"If they are often disturbing in their subtextual resonances, these
poems are also remarkably cheerful and good-natured, written with an
ear for (and eye to) American popular culture that is the most acute in
contemporary poetry."

I would agree. And here's one of those poems:


GREETING

That wood pole's
rosy crossbar,

shouldering a complement
of knobs,

like clothespins
or Xmas lights,

to which crinkly
wires rise up
from adjacent yards.

                      *

I miss _circumstance_
already--

the way a single word
could mean

necessary, relative,
provisional

and a bird flicks past
leaving

the sense that one
has waved one's hand.

| Here's a few sentences from Verena Andermatt Conley's forward to the
English
| translation of Catherine Clement's _Syncope: The Philosophy of Rapture_
| (University of Minnesota Press, 1994):
|
| "...Clement targets the century-old philosophical Western practice of
| establishing a full subject in philosophical terms one with the advent of
| metaphysics, the division between subject and object, and the demise of
woman
| as well as nature. This practice eliminates from its purview anything that
| approaches even in the slightest a vanishment, a gap, or a swoon of
meaning
| that Clement calls the _syncope_.  This term, which applies to symptoms as
| diverse as sneezing, laughing, asthma, or epileptic seizure, is borrowed
from
| music: 'The queen of rhythm, syncope  is also the mother of _dissonance_;
it
| is the source, in short, of a harmonious and productive discord...Attack
and
| haven, collision; a fragment of the beat disappears, and of this
| disappearance, rhythm is born.'"
| Substitute Wolsak's name for Clement's.  _Pen Chants_ is  _syncopated_
poetry
| of great verve and elegance.

I think in colors.  I think in masses and colors and planes. I don't start
to write a piece of music with a twelve tone row or something like that, or
even coming up with a melody and then trying to figure out what to do next.
I start with a total concept.  And then I try to fulfill what my imagination
has already given me inside.  Mozart said that he visualized a piece of music
almost instantly.  I do that and it takes me a long time to get it down on
paper.  I change it and change it and sometimes I can't even get it on paper.
I've experienced that over and over.  But once I start thinking about a new
piece, I get a pretty clear picture of what I'm going to do.  And then I go
into the details.

Dear Murat,

Didn't mean to put any thoughts in your mouth, but was responding to the
fact that a number of your posts seemed to have as their agon, Language
Poetry, as in today's listing:

"I believe Language school poetics is a hindrance to the younger generations
of poets writing today -even to those who like, appreciate or admire this
poetry. My ideas relate to, speak to that struggle, though in years I am
older than they are. I believe poetry today must find a completely new sets
of references (less French/European, less word/literature bound), more Asian,
more ecclectic, more open to visual arts -poetry not as "expansion" or
"development" of an avant-garde tradition, but a deeper re-orientation, a new
beginning, that is, create a new template."

By the way, I don't necessarily disagree with this--if it is indeed the
case for some poets--but I wouldn't want to universalize the/any
medicine.   In my critique, some years back in Sagetrieb ("Avant-garde
Propellants in the Machine Made of Words") where I discussed some of the
problems with the underpinnings and practices of the movement/moment (among
other things), I proposed the idea of a poetics--also rooted in Benjamin's
thought--of counter-continuities.   "Aspects of Poetics," a much newer
piece,  was written after reflecting on a number of more recent things, the
quarrels on this list some years ago, partly emanating from the Apex of the
M and generational disputes, the anxieties (maybe not of influence)
expressed at the NYU conference of young poets (in the late 90s--one of the
organizers was Rob Fitterman), poetry and poetics scuttlebutt.  The second
half of that essay isn't up yet, but its basic idea is to suggest seeing
poetics from an "as if" or "phantomological" perspective--less
heavy-handed, less investment-oriented.   My own perspective on poetics,
which I acknowledge as solely my own blundering via negativa and not meant
to be prescriptive, derives from my Western-Jewish interests and my Eastern
proto-buddhist inclinations.   I suppose, if it has an external rubric, it
comes out of Deleuze and Guattari's  remark in "Toward a Minor Literature":
"How may styles or genres or literary movement, even very small ones, have
only one single dream: to assume a major function in language,  to offer
themselves as a sort of state language, an official language....Create the
opposite dream: know how to create a becoming-minor (Is there hope for
philosophy, which for a long time has been an official referential
genre?  Let us profit from this moment in which antiphilosphy is trying to
be a language of power.) (p27)  Where appropriate, substitute the word
"poetics" for the word "philosophy" to get my drift.

I've been happy following this thread along with the other threads this
week, as they seem to be leading toward the same basic question(-ing)
of "evaluative" criticism. It's good to have a specific text that these
issues can play off of.

What troubles me, however, is how there doesn't seem to be a very
specific counter argument to Andrew Rathmann's initial, negative,
reading. (Since that is what he was being called to task for.)

And here, I only have a question (not intended to be a loaded

description of another and switching names, then what is original, and
of value, about this poet? I still remain interested in finding that out.

If there was a lack of originality in switching names, that lack was mine.
I, Tom Beckett, did that in a shorthand way of trying to show something of
what I see in Wolsak's work.  My limitations are notorious but you seem to be
confusing an approach to the work with the work being discussed.  _Pen
Chants_ is quite original and innovative but not paraphrasable.  The Cliff
Notes have yet to be written. Read _Pen Chants_. Or consult any of the
various links noted in previous posts to get a glimmer.  It's worth the look.
It's worth saying out loud.

True, a good reply. It brings to my mind the "always already" aspect
of individual poems . . . how poets desire to get out from underneath
the totalizing aspects of any poetics (even ones they've written), while
critics (reviewers, etc) desire to define them into such a structure.
There probably is no way out of this? As we need to talk of poetry . . .
otherwise we'd have to pass by in silence. And we're not a very silent
bunch.

Let's be clear, I have no interest  in trying to define Wolsak's work into a
structure.  I imported a vocabulary from an acknowledged source by way of
substitution.  This wasn't Wolsak's methodology, it was mine.

It kind of worries me how you generalize about poets and critic. Poets desire
any number of things in re: poetics. Worries about totalization strike me as
being after the fact of the poem. Damn, at least I hope so. Too much textual
anxiety leads to performance problems, yes?

Yes. I've always found working from theory can wilt a cursor. In theory, the

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Recent poetry is often said to exhibit formal diversity, and observation
bears this out.  Nevertheless, from the generalizing perspective of poetics
we see that at any given time a limited number of conventions will dominate
practice.  In my readings I've been trying to focus on poets who show
promise of resisting that domination and pushing beyond the approved modes,
even if, at the same time, they also exemplify them.  At the risk of being
classified by my  classifications (and judged by my judgments), I've tried
to spell out some of these modes:

1. The mode that satirizes capitalist society by ridiculing its idioms,
slogans, jingles, jargons, sound bites, etc.  The pun is a weapon in this
war, since it undercuts the jargon with pointedly irrelevant meanings.
Also in the arsenal are the line break, the creative misspelling, and
various other typographical hijinks, since they do simulated violence to
officially sanctioned language.  Cabri is the best satirist within this
mode, which, despite its ethos of guerrilla critique, is (like all satire)
fundamentally conservative.  But Cabri's wit often lures him to write past
and beyond his sense of righteousness, thus transcending mere satire.

2. The mode of Stein.  Its attraction for younger poets is that it relieves
the burden of having to load each line with maximum ore.  It frees the poet
from flashy writing and makes available the quieter resources of variation
and revision.  Stein's way of writing was so vacuous, so deadly, that it
could mean only one thing: this was written by Stein.  Yet in Spahr's work
the mode affords a constructive way to assemble large meanings out of small
bare statements grounded in a communally agreed-upon reality.  Lu's prose
is also tangentially connected to the Steinian manner in its plainness and
avoidance of affect, but Lu seems too interested in ideas, individuals, and
experiences to be a true resident of the great Steinian void.

3. The performative mode.  Here the dominant strain is New York School only
more prickly.  E.g, Minnis saying she wants to wear hot pants and rest a
boot on the back of a man's neck.  Also Wolff's "arch dolefulness" and
gothicism (though these two poets are actually quite dissimilar.)  This
mode is superficially related to the speech-based lyricism of the
workshops.  It differs in its refusal of easy poignancy and in its
flamboyant sense of humor.  Its practitioners want to give immediate
pleasure, not make demands on the reader's sympathies.  O'Leary is
somewhere in this part of the forest, too, for though his work contains a
good deal of Poundian scholarship, it also dramatizes a sensibility and
wants to create excitement for the reader.

4. Neo-romantic fragmentary lyricism.  Its diction invokes traditional
notions of lyric intensity, but it avoids linking those notions into
coherent statements, presumably so as not to commit the infraction of
appearing to be a "subject."  Syntax is shunned.  The poet conceals herself
behind a screen of beautiful fragments.  Wolsak, with her keen ear for
extravagant language.

Each of these writers is doing something new and good.  Now back to
concrete examples...

I didn't write that; Tom Beckett did.

A counter argument had not occurred to me. A well-argued negative case would
be something else; but, until the case against the book is made properly,
there is nothing with which to differ.

This is where I came in to the poetry "world" in UK where appreciation of
poetry was deemed to be pursued by demolition jobs spoken in such a way that
I and everyone else was deemed to agree - "we see that...", with protest
ignored - often based on incomplete or spurious arguments and assumptions.

In saying "What he said" of Tom Beckett's post, I was acknowledging and
furthering the appropriateness and wit of his post and my inadequacy. I
could easily have written " _Pen Chants_ is  _syncopated_ poetry of great
verve and elegance", but I didn't think to; as soon as I saw it in Tom
Beckett's post, I found something I already knew to have been expressed and
I wanted to support it.

I did not intend to suggest that Wolsak's book is adequately dealt with
thereby.

What is original in a poet may well be other than much of what is of value;
and I don't think that we should conflate the two though they surely
overlap.

It is an assumption that originality is THE thing. We must be careful of
such assumptions.

What appears original now may not appear so in the future. Nor is
originality necessarily to be desired. The perception of originality can
easily be the flipside of that rather suspect temporal-hierarchical approach
which the reviewer in question appears to favour

I pointed to the assumptions in _a style that is accretive and tonally
mixed, rather than finished and coherent._ and in _Imagine trying to use the
words "love" or "forever" in a speech-based lyric poem. Impossible."_

Both these assumptions seem to be repeated in the latest _The poet conceals
herself behind a screen of beautiful fragments. Wolsak, with her keen ear
for extravagant language._, which is why I mention then again.

I have no reason to doubt that Andrew Rathman is an excellent fellow...

I trust you all in usa feel thoroughly julyfourthed - here it seems to have
been
raining for  most of my life

It's nice that Andrew is serializing these close
readings (I like the project and its recurrence): it
provides a recurrent, intermittent feature to the
List, one of a different type than the vaguer but
necessary opinionation and merchandise/reading
promotion, --- sort of like television commericals or
public service announcements interrupting regular
programming.  Brian Kim Stefans used to post
"micro-reviews" of books on-List, similarly.  One risk
is that it can seem like "practice" for grown-up
review-writing elsewhere, as Stefans indeed
"graduated" to stop posting such here and publishing
reviews in the likes of The Boston Review.  Consistent
with Andrews' stated endorsement of on-line poetry, he
helpfully is relying on URL-trailable examples.  But
it's good, too, that Lawrence Upton takes Andrew to
task for the somewhat gratuitous, casual assertions.
(Then some Punch and Judy head-bopping!)  Especially
as one of the main features of these close readings,
proceeding out of their over-all departure from the
general rule of dialogue/symposium that governs the
List, is to ignore any subsequent dialogue they spur
(most of the close readings have been trailed by
responses that Andrew does not answer ["when the girls
came out to play Georgie Porgie ran away"-ism]), some
of which replies, like the one about drag and
blackface, are more "potent," memorable and volatile
than the close readings themselves.

But given the ambivalence toward criticism that keeps
variously expressing itself on the List, criticism
itself should not be allowed to escape with its own
transparencies and subterfuges, better in turn that it
too should be subjected to close reading, to determine
how its stylistic prerogatives succeed in maintaining
a power position over the text in question (the real
outcome of Barthes' "Death of the Author" criticism,
despite the earlier misinterpretations and
objectionable gay-bashing that passed, like the attack
on drag, unchallenged here ["Barthes, a frustrated gay
writer, had to force himself into the critic-closet &
his revenge was . . .",  "while Foucault went to SF
for the actual jouissance of MS, with unhappily lethal
results]: the post-authorial critic is revealed and
self-confessed to be a repertoire of rhetorical
tropes, too.  The "good" critic, like Barthes, should
deconstruct himself, simultaneously).

Tomorrow, I'll go on a diet and eat only macrobiotic
snacks, make parfaits using Rice Dream recipes.

It interests me, as someone who has published a
handful of criticism/reviews that I vainfully pride
myself upon, how the close readings (narrowly?)
imitate a particular stripe of review-writing,
readings that may be "close" but that are
unadventurous in their style, reproducing a mode of
extant criticism rather than wrenching after an
innovative approach to the very role of critic itself.
  Reviews are a genre and the genre characteristics
assert themselves with unconscious force, I'm all too
aware: thus, glib cleverness like "have her persimmons
and eat them too".  ["Eat"?  Did someone say "eat"?]
Some others (like Lisa Samuels' "deformative
criticism" or Benjamin Friedlander's tracings over
previous criticism in ~Qui Parle,~ or the sort of
neo-criticism that ~Telling It Slants~ advertises
itself on, etc. . . . or even Tom Beckett's fleeting
use of Tracing Paper criticism) take the interesting
gauntlet of criticism to be that the critic now needs
to depart from pre-designated and adopted modes as
much as the poets under study.  In a book like ~A Wild
Salience,~ essays about Rae Armantrout, it even seems
that "poets' criticism" equals the poems under
discussion themselves in obscurity.

My chest is covered with a Hansel and Gretel trail of
snack food, such as Cracker Jacks and Wheat Thins,
handfuls of General Mills cereals, that I stuff my
mouth with, gluttonously chomping, chomping as I type
with my "free" hand, rolling along the floor to the
scale to weigh myself again: yep, over 600 lb.

This familiar shadow of established critical tactics
in the close readings, or sense of deja-vu
(deja-lire), is there but somewhat difficult to
pinpoint in the close readings --- a tendency toward,
as Lawrence objected, unsubstantiated generalization;
a structure that begins with an ~in media res~
assertion of either a question ("Why has the pun
become so ubiquitous a device . . . ?"; "Who said the
lyric speaker was dead?"), the proverbs of a canonical
hero ("Heidegger says something to the effect . . ."),
an imaginary controversy ("Language writing's
censorship of the individual voice", "The works of a
number of younger poets, especially post-MFA poets,
reflect a desire to get out of the workshop mode")
that concerns itself with surveying, in fact, ~not~
the close reading of a single poem but continually
treating poets as a sort of flock, multitude,
concerned with what ~many~ poets are doing and then
deducing down from that bird's-eye view, ---or such,
which introduction becomes the pretext for a loosely
drawn "issue" or ersatz critical thought which the
close reading is then played off of (so that the
tension of the close reading is displaced onto how the
text addresses that straw dog issue, defusing the
protagonist-antagonist relation between poet and
critic, . . . a checkmate that still, as in provoking
Lawrence's objection, filters through [pyoo?]).

But the general ~flavor~ that is left, and that is so
familiar from prior criticism, is the disappearance
act of the close reader into a semi-objectivized
stance, an impersonalization, ironically, at the same
time as taking exception with the de-personalized
poetic mode.  Compare, instead, other critical
(earlier) modes, such as Melville's ~Hawthorne and His
Mosses~ [title??], for example, where the critical
posture was effusive, rapturous, even eroticized
enthusiasm and self-depiction (Melville portraying
himself as chancing upon the book and reading it lying
down in hay in a barn or open field), or Pound's
schizo-critical correspondences, which critiqued by
frothing at the mouth.  The movement toward feminist
"personal criticism" called that impersonal façade
"Archimidean" (in the sense of: give me a point
outside the world and I will be able to move the world
with a lever), and regarded it as untrustworthy
because it erases its basis in gender, class, and
such.

Curiously, the close readings are able to keep the
pressure of re-personalization stifled for only so
long, and they habitually end with striking frequency
(unconscious self-imitation) on a valedictory sentence
where the strain it takes to keep "I" out of the
picture falters and the first person (singular or
plural) re-enters only to depart, much like the
similar, well-known habit of pronouns at the closing
line of a John Ashbery poem ["I promise the sun was a
switch, or tickler", "if we should ever get to know
them", "We may live more patently . . .", "I think /
the theme created itself . . .", etc., etc., etc.,
from ~Can You Hear, Little Birdie~ or elsewhere].

Michael,

Interesting, I just finished reading Deleuze'st wo film books (movement image
and time image). I agree with one thing you are saying and deleuse also
suggesting: how to project a point of view (e.g. poetics) while avoiding it
to become an authoritative point of view. That's possible, it seems to be, by
constantly being on guard -maybe by undercutting what one has staked out- a
continuum of beginnings.

Michael Heller wrote of 'becoming minor' and Murat calls for 'a continuum of
beginnings' which would be more 'Asian,  more ecclectic, more open to visual
arts -poetry not as "expansion" or  "development" of an avant-garde
tradition, but a deeper re-orientation, a new beginning, that is, create a
new template."

This set me thinking of a review I read about a month back by Sven Birkerts
in the NYTimes BR of the more 'mainstream' Jorie Graham's latest which was
appreciate but critical of what he felt was her 'tentativeness' and leads
him to 'question the viability of poetry as an instrument of
philosophy...the disappearance of the perceived thing or the felt experience
into the inconclusive enactments of process points to a dead end.'  Whatever
you think of Graham's work it does seem to me that this 'criticism' is
perhaps missing the point here in that the poetic focus on process is in
fact the type of poetics (impelled by poets) that is needed.

No gay-bashing or attack on drag in my description of the French scene of
the 50ies & 60ies. Maybe that's why it went "unchallenged here"? i.e. no
one, except you, took it as such. To the contrary: the point being that the
late sixties sexpol movements started to let gays (including B & F), among
other oppressed groups, come out & breathe & live more freely, while opening
a range of theoretical & practical areas of investigation. (BTW. there is a
fascinating little "roman à clef" on that period called "Le Bordel Andalou"
by Georges Lapassade, published in the early 1970ies by Ediitons de l'Herne,
but as far as I know not translated into English.)

sounds good to me but maybe we can write and then think and then think
again?

the first think is poetics?
the twice think is criticism?

this is a poem.

I may be too embedded in the discourse of linguistics to be very clear
about this.  A "natural language," for example, is the term used by
linguists to distinguish something like English or French from constructed
languages like Esperanto, and from animal communication systems,=20
and from computer languages, and from semiotic systems such as
those that inhere in architecture, film, or clothing. =20

Linguists, especially U.S.-trained linguists, generally find it easy to
say what a sentence means, or that a particular string of words is or is
not English.  I find this particular professional skill very odd, and come
to language poetry precisely because it seems to be made mostly of
'unEnglish'. =20

What makes something unEnglish is in fact not clear at all.  I suspect
that this is one of the two problems that define modern
linguistic science (as per Kuhn's definition of 'normal science', the
other problem being Plato's problem, the poverty of the stimulus, or, how
can a child learn a language so well when it hears so few correct
examples of that language).

In one approach, something can be unEnglish but still be grammatically
English: colorless green ideas sleep furiously.  I find that a lot of
language poetry can be described by this model: "I have backed up / into
my silence / as inexhaustible as the sun / that calls a tip of candle / to
its furnace" (F. Howe).  A lot of non-language poetry also follows this
model: thou still unravished bride of quietness... Likewise, something can
be unEnglish by dispensing with grammatical coherence: "chaotic architect
repudiate line Q confine lie link realm" (S. Howe).  Again, you can find
non-language poetry that can be described by this model as well (though
not as easily, because strings that lack grammatical coherence are more
readily judged to be nonsense--yet another contestable term).

Within the term 'coherent semantic trajectory' I mean to include such
examples of non-English, but only to the extent that they do not violate
transparency or conventional understandability.  I am not trying to assert
that conventional understandability is something that exists or is
possible, but that this is what most people mean when they say they
'understand' what has been written.  Most language poetry that interests
me does so because it seems to offer different qualities of understanding,
redefines 'understanding'.  Since we havn't yet devised a theory of
langauge that accounts very well for conventional understandability, I
wonder if we might make some headway by trying to account for other
understandabilities.

Clai  and Listers. This interests me and I concur in the main. Its maybe a
"function" of language poetry to point to the problematic nature of meaning
in so-called "comventional" literary writing or in fact in any language
system or even in philosophy or say the question of whether music means
anything: as one eg learns more about music I imagine that (to ceratain
musicians or music teachers) to say that music may not mean anything or even
that some may dont mean anything (apart from implying that what the musician
adressed does is pointless) also asks  the question: what kind of meaning
and what is information, what does it mean when you say this "means" or I
"understand". There was a young girl over here (NZ) Laura (forget her other
name) whose was "precocious" and she wrote things like:

                Waiting  under the bridge
                 I understood it.....

Things like that. Quite clever ..the young girl  (she was only about 9  I
think) was quite a "hit" but I think the parents wisely withdrew her from
the public gaze for ther time being: but obviously she had a good
understanding (!) of basic puns, liguistics etc and maybe is of great
ability, I dont know. She may reappear and take the lit. world by storm, who
knows...

But that aside I concur ...I find it hard to differentiate what is not or is
unEnglish: and writing or music can be "meaningful" without meaning anything
that we can easily (if at all) transcribe into a "sentence" so "difficult"
poetry is always mimicking the problem of knowledge: so the best or most
interesting poetry paradoxically or expectably (maybe depending on one's
temperament or training )  "resists understanding" at least, and is more or
less absorptive, to use Bernstein's term.

Which book does the Hoowe quote coome from I would be intersted to read it?

 Richard.

That's a good one, but Chomsky was actually not the first to say it.  It's
usually assigned to Uriel Weinreich, tho once when I did some web searching,
I was unable to find anything that absolutely confirmed him as the first
either.  But I'm a lazy researcher.

The full quip is "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy."

Hmm, I have heard this line as far as I can remember back -- but always as
"A language is a dialect with an army" (or: "with guns", which is my own
preferred version) but never with "a navy" -- but that could be because I'm
from Luxembourg, & we are land-locked & don't have a Navy. In Luxembourg
they finally upgraded "Letzeburgesch" from being a dialect to being a
language. Oddly enough they abolished the army during the years they put
together the dictionary of Letzeburgesch & standardized the spelling, which
made the metamorphosis from Dialect to Language more salon-fähig; so in this
case they took the literal guns away from the soldiers and gave them back
metaphorically to the dialect. Well they kept a few armed men around as
palace-guard -- to guard the Grand-duchess who is a Cubana & thus speaks
primarily Spanish...

Yiddish would be a natural language like any other "language" or  a dialect:
it is the language of German Jews and is a language in its own "right" so to
speak as far as I know: what Clai is talking about I think is/are
unLanguages if such exist...the areas of language between signing as in the
semiotics she refers to and that realm of thought that is beyond normative
grammar or syntax or syntax.....when we fall into a "brown study"....the
nuances...the area of  the limnal: or maybe a vision, a voice...something
seeming to gesticulate at the periphreral of our vision: the seeming
language of a waking dream...strangenesses. Richard.

Kenneth Koch, 77, Poet of New York School, Dies

By ALAN FEUER

New York Times


Kenneth Koch, a poet of the New York School whose work combined the
sardonic wit of a borscht-belt comic, the erotic whimsy of a Surrealist
painter and the gritty wisdom of a scared young soldier, died yesterday
after a long battle with leukemia at his home in Manhattan. He was 77.

Mr. Koch's literary career spanned more than 50 years and resulted in
the publication of at least 30 volumes of poetry and plays whose
linguistic exuberance and experimental zest were bested only by their
omnivorous subject matter. He wrote elegies, parodies, Dadaist dramas
and fragmented shards of loosely structured verse on a palette of topics
that ranged from his father's furniture business in southern Ohio to
Japanese baseball stars to the pleasures of eating lunch.=20

Mr. Koch (pronounced coke) was considered a founding member of the New
York School, an avant-garde poetic movement that was forged in the
Manhattan of the 1950's when the beer at the Cedar Tavern flowed as
smoothly as the passionate talk about Abstract Expressionist art. He and
his contemporaries =97 the poets, John Ashbery and Frank O'Hara, and the
painters, Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers =97 took up the brash,
anti-establishment mantle of their beatnik predecessors, but with a more
classically European touch and with less machismo and facial hair.=20

Later in life, Mr. Koch became well known as a professor of poetry,
mainly at Columbia University, where he lectured on literature and
inspired budding writers for nearly 40 years. He was a spontaneous,
high-octane teacher who was not above leaping on to desks to prove a
point and who, for many years, taught writing to grade-school children,
claiming that poetry was as thrilling as stickball.

Kenneth Jay Koch was born Feb. 27, 1925 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of
Stuart Koch, who owned a furniture store, and Lillian Koch, who wrote
amateur literary reviews. After graduating high school, he served in the
Philippines during World War II, a harrowing experience that he did not
translate into verse until the very end of his life.

When the war ended, Mr. Koch enrolled at Harvard. He studied writing
with the poet Delmore Schwartz and embarked on a lifelong friendship
with Mr. Ashbery. By his own account, he was hungry for the poet's life
but na=EFve about the art of making poems. "I was so dumb I thought =
Yeats
was pronounced Yeets," he said in an interview in 1977.

"I think we may have been more conscious than many poets of the surface
of the poem, and what was going on while we were writing and how we were
using words," he said of the New York School in the same interview. "I
don't think we saw any reason to resist humor in our poems."

Indeed, Mr. Koch's poetry is at once lyrical and humorous, aching with
emotion and achingly funny. He managed to write verse that is breathy
and expansive in tone, yet still rooted in the American predilections
for pop culture references and proper nouns.


This is an excerpt from Mr. Koch's poem, "Thank You":



The only thing I could publicize well would be my tooth,

Which I could say came with my mouth and in a most engaging manner

With my whole self, my body and including my mind,

Spirits, emotions, spiritual essences, emotional substances, poetry,
dreams, and lords

Of my life, everything, all embraceleted with my tooth

In a way that makes one wish to open the windows and scream "Hi!" to the
heavens,

And "Oh, come and take me away before I die in a minute!"

"His great ability as a poet was to combine modernism and lyricism and
to write poems that gave you a feeling as joyous as Whitman," said Ron
Padgett, a former student of Mr. Koch's and a poet himself.

Speaking of Mr. Koch's long poem, "The Duplications," one reviewer said
it read like a collaboration between Lord Byron, Walt Disney, Frank Buck
and Andre Breton.

Collaboration was, in fact, a crucial part of Mr. Koch's art. He and Mr.
Rivers, for instance, worked together on a series of painting-poems
called "New York, 1950-1960" and "Post Cards." He also wrote the
librettos to operas set to music by, among others, the composer Ned
Rorem.

Mr. Koch once told an interviewer that, as a child, he kept a little
orange book named the "Scribble-in Book," which he filled with his
sketches and musings. In high school, he set out to write what he called
"obscene and angry" poems, which he showed to his junior-year English
teacher, Katherine Lappa. Although he thought the verses would horrify
Ms. Lappa, she told Mr. Koch =97 at least, as he recalled it =97 "That's
exactly the way you should be feeling when you're 17 years old."

This fall, two of his books will be issued posthumously =97 one contains
many of his previously unpublished poems from the early 1950's, and the
other is a gathering of new works. His most recent book was "New
Addresses," a collection of apostrophes to abstract ideas like World War
II and Judaism.

He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and won
several prizes over the course of his career, including the Bollingen
Prize in 1995 and the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry
in 1996. He was awarded three Fulbright scholarships and a National
Endowment for the Arts grant.

He is survived by his wife, Karen Koch; his daughter, Katherine Koch;
and a grandson, Jesse Statman.

Fellow poeticists,

I am conducting studies on the words "culture" and "religion." These two
words seem to be bandied about with abandon these days, and I'm going to
write an essay about what they *really* mean-- philologically,
etymologically, in current use, etc.

If anyone can point to resources or remembers a particularly relevant
passage in a book they read, please share.

"culture"   "religion"

This is sad news indeed.  I have been an admirer of Koch's serendipity since
high school.  His more considered meditations are some of the most
sparklingly fluid performances in the language.  The planet will miss his
presence, terribly.  Best, Bill

Tom,

The first and second think could very well be poetics and criticism, but
they could also be poems, depending on the temperament or inclination of the
writer. Obviously, you've demonstrated that a poem can include poetics, or
the process of working toward a poetics. Good. I like to keep things as open
as possible.

You realize, of course,  that Frazer's Minifesto, a collaborative document
in process, invites comparison with Shakespeare on the question of
authorship. I find this flattering, but not without risk. Some scholars
might look at our collaboration and attribute it to Christopher Marlowe.

Vernon

my query was partly tongue-in-cheek...also, it was mostly eastern european
jews who spoke yiddish, not german jews, at least by the modern era... so
gertrude was not a yiddish speaker but alice probably was...  thanks all
for the flurry of weinreich/chomsky/luxembourgish quips...

Murat and Michael:


I'm excited to see Deleuze (and Guattari) being used in this
conversation. The problem of, as Murat writes, "how to project a point of
view (e.g. poetics) while avoiding it to become an authoritative point of
view" is a good one to bring D&G to. Deleuze (especially useful for me in
the Cinema vols and The Fold) is also relevant to the idea of
"trajectories" which is a part of the "Puns" string. And I apologize in
advance for the lack of detail in what follows -- there's lots more that
could be said, and I would, given worlds enough. I've decided to just
look at a couple specific comments instead of filling out more of what
D&G alone and separately do (as I see it).


I'm wondering about Murat's use of  "being on guard" or "undercutting"
what one has staked out" and "that is, create a new template" as ways to
avoid the "authoritative point of view." And this by Michael: >The
second

>half of that essay isn't up yet, but its basic idea is to suggest
seeing

>poetics from an "as if" or "phantomological" perspective--less

>heavy-handed, less investment-oriented.   My own perspective on
poetics,

>which I acknowledge as solely my own blundering via negativa and not
meant

>to be prescriptive, derives from my Western-Jewish interests and my
Eastern

>proto-buddhist inclinations.


Michael's phrasing is curious to me because you seem to be talking about
two different approaches to poetics -- is this right? One which
generalizes a point of view on poetics, and then your own "blundering"
derived from your own interests (which sounds much more interesting than
the first, by the way!). Is "less heavy-handed" a good thing -- how about
extremely heavy-handed or not handed at all? What's the "less" about here
and in terms of investment oriented? If a poetics can merely be "less"
heavy-handed or investment-oriented, why have it? Why should a poetics
seek to cover more than one's own momentary poetry? (I mean this as a
real question). When can "official language" be used to undermine
"official language" -- and can it. (Real questions, again). I'm thinking
all of this in terms of becoming-minor, of course. Why become major?


Murat's language is also interesting to me, especially in the context of
Deleuze. The two cinema volumes are terrific and they offer the author a
gazillion ideas about , as Deleuze says in "He Stuttered," "carving out a
nonpreexistent foreign language within his [sic] own language" (once
again, those pesky trajectories). How what D says in Cinema becomes
"being on guard" or "creating a new template" is what bothers me. Once
again, why would one want to create a new template? And this creation
sounds like a paranoid move too. A defensive posture would hinder the
kind of free play that could break templates and even the idea of a
template. I think as long as "point of view" comes from the outside, it
will never do anything other than establish authority -- by being
dependent on common ideas like "object" and "subject" for example -- and
never undermine or push out. Deleuze, in The Fold, writes "It is not a
variation of truth according to the subject, but the condition in which
the truth of a variation appears to the subject." In other words, the
subject varies as part of its own condition which is a point of view
<italic>on</italic> variation (actually on the line of variation). Once
this Baroque idea goes Neo-Baroque, this is not like "no absolute ground"
but more like many absolute grounds, all of which apply (the monad is
held open as with pliers, says D when talking about the Neo-Baroque). And
of course it carries with it ontological implications, which are always
terrific. "Projecting a point of view" (Murat's phrase) is interesting
phrasing too -- the projector remains quite distant and intact.

Kenneth Koch, 77, Poet of New York School, Dies

By ALAN FEUER

New York Times


Kenneth Koch, a poet of the New York School whose work combined the
sardonic wit of a borscht-belt comic, the erotic whimsy of a Surrealist
painter and the gritty wisdom of a scared young soldier, died yesterday
after a long battle with leukemia at his home in Manhattan. He was 77.

Mr. Koch's literary career spanned more than 50 years and resulted in
the publication of at least 30 volumes of poetry and plays whose
linguistic exuberance and experimental zest were bested only by their
omnivorous subject matter. He wrote elegies, parodies, Dadaist dramas
and fragmented shards of loosely structured verse on a palette of topics
that ranged from his father's furniture business in southern Ohio to
Japanese baseball stars to the pleasures of eating lunch.=20

Mr. Koch (pronounced coke) was considered a founding member of the New
York School, an avant-garde poetic movement that was forged in the
Manhattan of the 1950's when the beer at the Cedar Tavern flowed as
smoothly as the passionate talk about Abstract Expressionist art. He and
his contemporaries =97 the poets, John Ashbery and Frank O'Hara, and the
painters, Jane Freilicher and Larry Rivers =97 took up the brash,
anti-establishment mantle of their beatnik predecessors, but with a more
classically European touch and with less machismo and facial hair.=20

Later in life, Mr. Koch became well known as a professor of poetry,
mainly at Columbia University, where he lectured on literature and
inspired budding writers for nearly 40 years. He was a spontaneous,
high-octane teacher who was not above leaping on to desks to prove a
point and who, for many years, taught writing to grade-school children,
claiming that poetry was as thrilling as stickball.

Kenneth Jay Koch was born Feb. 27, 1925 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the son of
Stuart Koch, who owned a furniture store, and Lillian Koch, who wrote
amateur literary reviews. After graduating high school, he served in the
Philippines during World War II, a harrowing experience that he did not
translate into verse until the very end of his life.

When the war ended, Mr. Koch enrolled at Harvard. He studied writing
with the poet Delmore Schwartz and embarked on a lifelong friendship
with Mr. Ashbery. By his own account, he was hungry for the poet's life
but na=EFve about the art of making poems. "I was so dumb I thought =
Yeats
was pronounced Yeets," he said in an interview in 1977.

"I think we may have been more conscious than many poets of the surface
of the poem, and what was going on while we were writing and how we were
using words," he said of the New York School in the same interview. "I
don't think we saw any reason to resist humor in our poems."

Indeed, Mr. Koch's poetry is at once lyrical and humorous, aching with
emotion and achingly funny. He managed to write verse that is breathy
and expansive in tone, yet still rooted in the American predilections
for pop culture references and proper nouns.


This is an excerpt from Mr. Koch's poem, "Thank You":



The only thing I could publicize well would be my tooth,

Which I could say came with my mouth and in a most engaging manner

With my whole self, my body and including my mind,

Spirits, emotions, spiritual essences, emotional substances, poetry,
dreams, and lords

Of my life, everything, all embraceleted with my tooth

In a way that makes one wish to open the windows and scream "Hi!" to the
heavens,

And "Oh, come and take me away before I die in a minute!"

"His great ability as a poet was to combine modernism and lyricism and
to write poems that gave you a feeling as joyous as Whitman," said Ron
Padgett, a former student of Mr. Koch's and a poet himself.

Speaking of Mr. Koch's long poem, "The Duplications," one reviewer said
it read like a collaboration between Lord Byron, Walt Disney, Frank Buck
and Andre Breton.

Collaboration was, in fact, a crucial part of Mr. Koch's art. He and Mr.
Rivers, for instance, worked together on a series of painting-poems
called "New York, 1950-1960" and "Post Cards." He also wrote the
librettos to operas set to music by, among others, the composer Ned
Rorem.

Mr. Koch once told an interviewer that, as a child, he kept a little
orange book named the "Scribble-in Book," which he filled with his
sketches and musings. In high school, he set out to write what he called
"obscene and angry" poems, which he showed to his junior-year English
teacher, Katherine Lappa. Although he thought the verses would horrify
Ms. Lappa, she told Mr. Koch =97 at least, as he recalled it =97 "That's
exactly the way you should be feeling when you're 17 years old."

This fall, two of his books will be issued posthumously =97 one contains
many of his previously unpublished poems from the early 1950's, and the
other is a gathering of new works. His most recent book was "New
Addresses," a collection of apostrophes to abstract ideas like World War
II and Judaism.

He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and won
several prizes over the course of his career, including the Bollingen
Prize in 1995 and the Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry
in 1996. He was awarded three Fulbright scholarships and a National
Endowment for the Arts grant.

He is survived by his wife, Karen Koch; his daughter, Katherine Koch;
and a grandson, Jesse Statman.

Hi Vernon,

 I invoked the "second think" because a first thought isn't always the best
thought.  That third think Bell wants wasn't mentioned because I'm not an
advocate of overthinking things. Also I also don't care if I have the last
word--actually, I don't think one can--which is kind of the point of our
Minifesto, eh?  What I've always wanted more than anything else from poetry
is to feel a part of a larger cultural conversation: to say or do something
that might be of some use...to find some measure of acceptance as a worker in
the field.


I'm not sure I understand your reference to Shakespeare but I know that all
art, all human exchange, is risky.  I wouldn't have it any other way.

Hey, this is fun!

Tom

Hi Tom

Kerouac was my second boyhood hero, but I don't agree with his statement
that the first thought is necessarily the best. Sometimes relying on the
first thought can prevent a person from over-thinking, a practice that I try
to  avoid because it can lead to endless convolutions of logic  wrapping
around the main point until I lose sight of it. Even so, the 87th thought
can sometimes be the best.

I think the minifesto is something that can be added to indefinitely. Fun
should be an integral part of it. To refer to an old thread I never
responded to, I've always believed that literature can be fun and that more
lives need fun in them.

My reference to Shakespeare relates to the question of who really wrote
Shakespeare's plays. I think some scholars have asserted that Marlowe wrote
at least one of them. I'm not a Shakespeare scholar, so I can't say anything
definitive about the authorship.

Perhaps a greater risk to our credibility is the undergrad who wonders how
many monkeys it would take to produce Frazer's Minifesto as a result of
random typing.

On the other hand, aleatoric composition could have a place somewhere in the
minifesto.

Vernon

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Do poets wish to be understood?

A: No, not really.  What they desire is admiration, good blurbs, tenure,
proud parents, flattering author photos, invitations to parties, chances to
snub the competition, checks from deranged old philanthropists, and the
Nobel Prize.  In short, they want love.  Unlike bagging groceries or
assembling Nikes, writing implicates the ego.  And the ego demands love--a
much more powerful incentive than cash, even in our slave economy.

Q: OK, that explains Jorie Graham.  But how is it that genuinely new and
good poems continue to appear?

A: Good poems emerge because genuine talent cannot conceal itself, nor can
the pretentious fake it for very long.

Q: What is the role of criticism in all this?  (I mean, non-academic
criticism.)

A: To help the process along by trying to identify the new and the good,
the bogus and the trite, so that other writers may learn and benefit.

Q: Whoa, hombre.  Isn't that sort of a power trip?  I mean, like, who are
you to say what's good and what isn't?  Aren't you working within a pretty
narrow horizon of circumscribed norms?  You make all these assertions, but
you never cite any theorists.  And you're really nothing but a bunch of
tropes, anyway.  We all are.  Nothing but us straw dogs around here.  What
do you say to that?  Huh?

A: This is a stunning collection by one of our finest poets, writing at the
height of her powers.  It's a delicately fierce book, alternately
heartbreaking and hilarious, accessible, reflexive, never dull and often
moving, unsettling the lyric subject with postmodern flair.  A dazzling
investigation of the daily disjunctions of cultural identity.  The poet's
imagination is working at full kilter.  Deeply emotional.  An amusing,
amazing music.  Should change the way we read poetry.  Hang on, it's quite
a ride.

Oh well, so much for my carreer as a linguist! I had such hopes. But any
dialect can be/ is surely a language: impossible to have a nonLanguage? By
definition - it is maybe that we need to redefine langauge: English or
"received English" obviously had better organised armies and navies I havent
read Chomsky (havent read far too much in fact). I was thinking of those
people who (with regard to English) believe that the correct english is that
of the BBC in England and someone neccesarily eduacted at Yale, Harvard, or
The Bronx (sorry Bronxites!) (no, I was going to say is Barnard?) and that
all the people in New Zealand and Australia etc speak BAD ENGLISH...but of
course they still speak a language.
  But seriously, a friend of mine objected to what he calls the
"inefficiency" of a language (Chinese) with its millions of superfluous
characters  (ideograms, not ideotograms I corrected him) he believes that
they should be forced to have a better language for the purposes of human
progess and overall efficiency as and that it can and DID work as in
Indonesia when they made (forced them at gunpoint I'll be damned) everyone
to speak the same basic language and this made everything more betterer:
more progressive.  he also doesnt like my namesake Charles Taylor of Liberia
who is apparantly the chief flog in Liberia but I said I hoped that he WAS a
terribly ruthless (if i wasnt indifferent to the man's existence or
otherwise) and backward man: we need them...I hoped I said that when my
friend returns form Morocco (she has a Morrocan "partner" ) that she will
report the delights of witnessing some marvellously quaint and exotically
and (hopefully erotic) and barbaric beheadings.  Just as I have never been
to England but I dream of cottages and tea and scones and kindnesses and
goodnesses with honey in them..... Richard Brookey

think of K Koch today as poem says "literal/local" voice always
though the day/the days/ the sound of the streets/etc

don't always call for good poems.

K Koch is missed a key/
a beat

Dear _sidereality_ readers:

It's July and, predictably, it's hot in several ways, but if you're stuck
inside with nothing to do and nowhere to go, don't fret...there's a new
issue of your favorite poetry e-journal (http://www.sidereality.com) just
waiting to be read.

That's right, volume 1, issue 3 (July-September) of _sidereality_ is now
available for your reading pleasure, and things look a little different --
but hopefully, better -- this time around. Spread the word!

We're also moving to a quarterly publication schedule, with a final 2002
issue due out in October. Although new editions of _sidereality_ will now be
released less frequently, the amount of content published per year will not
change appreciably.

The quality of poetry remains at the very high level that you've come to
expect from _sidereality_, as we've obtained work from the following
standout writers: Patrick Armstrong, David Aronson, Nancy Bennett, David
Braden, Lida Broadhurst, Joel Chace, B. R. Dionysius, Richard Fein, Kevin
Fitzgerald, Cheryl Floyd-Miller, Vernon Frazer, Kyle Wade Grove, Patricia
Huyett, Stephen Kirbach, John Edward Lawson, Andrew Lundwall, Prasenjit
Maiti, Charlotte Mandel, Samuel Minier, Andrew Penland, Michael Rothenberg,
Gregory St. Thomasino, Susan Terris, Mikal Trimm, Lina ramona Vitkauskas, A.
A. Walker, and Jim Wittenberg.

Take time to peruse the new issue, and please let me know what you think.

Thanks and best wishes,

Clayton A. Couch

ANTENNAE PERFORMANCE (music and poetry from ANTENNAE, a biannual journal of
experimental poetry and music) & THE RACE

9 PM
JULY 12 (this friday)
$5
at the CHASE CAFE (7301 North Sheridan, Rogers Park, Chicago - three blocks
from the red line Jarvis stop - 773-743-5650)

Organized as a continuous but sparse collage performance, the first portion
of this event will include around 90 minutes of works from the first two
issues (and one piece of music from the forthcoming third issue) of
ANTENNAE. The works, a variety both discordant and sympathetic, will be
positioned within the performance space and time in the interests of the
individual pieces and the dialogues they potentially instigate.

Following the Antennae performance, Chicago rock bank THE RACE will play.

Antennae performance organized by Zachary Seldess. For further information
on this or future events, write to zseldess@hotmail.com. For more
information about Antennae, contact Jesse Seldess at j_seldess@hotmail.com.

from "tactics" by Jen Hofer
"Belfast Breakfast Songs" by Gerhard Stäbler

Bill. Hiya me old mate!  Remember I told you about my visit to NY in 1993
took part in a reading of As the Sun Tries to Go Down organised I think by
Jordan Davis and I ('ve not been able to get that book I must get it, stupid
I could have got it easily then in NY) the Reading was good and Koch's
language rich and energetic and moving along with people taking turns
appropriately until dark and I imbibed a " six pack" and met some
interesting people there in a park on the Lower East side.... Interesting
experience.  Sad that Koch has died. Richard

To respond to Jim Neighbors' points:

Well there are two things I'm trying to discuss at once, and
perhaps--inevitably--they blur, have to blur, so all confusion should be
laid at my door.  I was trying to deal with the attitude towards poetics
(as manifesto and ideology), whether it was going to be another aggressive
territorial activity, whether it was going to become a prison-house for
those who'd been captivated by it, the anxiety that I spoke about.  That
was one part of the discussion.  In the second half of the essay, I try to
suggest some guidelines, looking at poetics as an "as-if," as the work of
ghosts with parameters of some kind, which might lead one toward a poetics
that was not so heavy-handed.  As your remarks on "The Fold" clearly
indicate, any ground can become a new cathedral, a new absolute, so how do
we stay off the ground is always the question.  Levinas writes: "Is it
certain a true poet occupies a place?  Is the poet not that which, in the
eminent sense of the term, loses place, ceases occupation, precisely, and
is thus the very opening of space...."  This sense of things is what my
writing was aiming for.

has nothing to do with IE...it's a server-side issue, it seems.

as an aside, you can always set up opera to be recognized as ie if you want
to troubleshoot something like this...

Hi,

I'm sure that this Lissa Wolsak thread has been already threaded to
death, and I've dipped in and out of it while traveling and thus have
had a rather fragmented disrupted personal relationship to the
thread, but I feel compelled to reply, regardless of any redundancy
I'm sure I'm guilty of.

I find much problematic in Andrew's points re: Lissa.  First of all,
*he* decides she's like Susan Howe and then proceeds to discuss how
she fails at being Susan Howe.  Reading Lissa and what she's doing, I
would challenge that she's like Susan Howe at all or should need to
be like Susan Howe.  I feel that Lissa's cerebral/orgasmic mysticism
is all her own.

Secondly, "accretive and tonally mixed, rather than finished and
coherent" seems to be being presented here as an example of some sort
of lack in the poetry, but I must be misreading AR because I can't
imagine that "finished and coherent" would be presented as a goal in
such writing.

As far as:

I agree with Chris S's challenging that this uncertainty doesn't
exist in Howe.  Again, I'm confused how such uncertainty can be seen
as a negative.  Doesn't such ambiguity challenge, seduce, intrigue
the reader?  Haven't poets been destabilizing their relationships
with readers thus for ages, I mean, isn't it a sort of standard
practice by now?

I find Lissa's work difficult to talk about, which is great.  When I
read her I feel like I'm being played and swept along (or swept up
in) and that I have to let go of all my rationalizing bullshit.  It's
a lovely experience.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I very much enjoyed Heidi Peppermint's "Brief Hystery of the Pun" --and
especially the analytical view of the social and political ramifications of
puns...

I just wanted to comment on her use of the term "Noise" to describe the
excluded element--the other--which is inherently missing from the
(imperialist) tradition.

When she said, "Noise...is the defining constitutive element of the
abundantly punning text" I understood her use of the term (and its
effectiveness), but couldn't help but hope that people wouldn't
misunderstand "noise" as somehow only negative (as in an auditory or
musical context), or as something that has no meaning or significance other
than its "disrupting" of the traditional, regulating, (nationalist,
imperialist, capitalist) text.

There is also a similar possible misunderstanding (I believe) in her use of
the phrase "essential endemic disorder" to describe some attempted new
linguistic systems of recent punsters.

I'm just wondering if the point shouldn't be made that the "noise" inherent
in the pun--that shift of entire frame of reference to that which is
outside the order of the (orderly) text--need not be incoherent in itself,
and only acts as an "essential endemic disorder" in relation to the order
of the traditional (nationalistic) text.

The disruption of the pun, and the "other" readings of the pun, can also
have complex "other" meanings which then intrude on the orderliness of the
precision-seeking agenda of the normative text and destroy orderliness with
a living--and unresolvable--ambiguity.

So the "disorder" of the pun's ambiguity is not necessarily incoherent
("meaningless") as much as it is disruptive by forcing a multiplicity of
readings and a "living with" contradictions (and other worlds) which would
otherwise remain outside the text.

Even "ecstatic whirling gibberish" then becomes recognizable as much more
meaningful (in its punning sounds--and ambiguous depth) than the
exclusionary term "gibberish" would traditionally try to make us believe.

Heidi----I'm working on an ambiguous pun-filled prose poem, and your brief
hystery added to my thinking in signifi(cant) ways...
Thanks,

21 Unanswered Questions
http://unansweredquestions.org/


1.  Why was Osama bin Laden allowed to leave the American Hospital in Dubai
after meeting with CIA station chief Larry Mitchell from 4-14th July 2001?

2.  Given the Bush family's close ties to the Bin Laden family is there a
conflict of interest at play here which may have influenced President GW
Bush to limit or kill any investigation?

3.  Is ex-President GHW Bush's advisory role in the private defense
contractor Carlyle Group and close business ties with the Bin Laden family
endangering American lives ?

4.  Why were FBI investigations during 2000-2001 into Al-Quaeda, their
funding, and terrorism all blocked and shut down by the FBI?  Why did
Clinton shut down FBI investigations into the connection between the
Binladen family and a known Terrorist organization?

5.  Why did NORAD fail to respond to three hijackings despite all means
available to them to respond to such emergencies (e.g., scambling fighter
jets to make visual contact with the hjacked planes) along with a previously
impeccable record of rapid response?  Why has NORAD lied about Langley AF
jets responding instead of the ones at Andrews AFB?

6.  Why was ex-President GHW Bush in the White House with Dick Cheney and
Condoleeza Rice during the attacks?

7.  GW Bush claimed to have seen the first plane hit the tower when he could
not have; Pentagon officials cancelled travel plans on 9/10; White House
officials took Cipro before anthrax attacks on Democrats and media; FEMA
groups were transferred to NYC on 9/10. All these point to prior knowledge
by the Bush administration. Why is no one reporting these facts?

8.  Why is the SEC withholding information it has concerning the identity of
the purchasers of unusually large volumes of put options on American and
United Airlines stocks (and other companies located in WTC)? It is reported
that the profits made on these options could run well into the hundreds of
millions. Better yet why has there been no demand from Congressional leaders
for the release of this information?

9.  If Bush knew nothing about this in advance, as he says, (the FBI screwed
up and lost all that important information in a bureaucratic swamp), then
how did they figure out within a few hours that Bin Laden did it from the
caves in Pakistan?

10.  Why is it that since one engine from our plane crashing in Pennsylvania
was found 10 miles preceeding the crash site, an exact configuration that a
heat seeking missle would cause, is there no investigation into the
likelihood this plane was shot down?

11.  Why did Congress pass the suspiciously ready-to-roll US Patriot Act
without even reading it?

12.  Why is the CIA continuing to finance Al-Qaeda-style paramilitaries in
Columbia, Indonesia, Afganistan, etc.?

13.  What has happened to press coverage of the Anthrax episode, and why
does the FBI investigation of Don Wileys death differ from that of the
Memphis police?

14.  Why has no one questioned the statement that a novice pilot hit the
pentagon? A casual view from the Navy Annex, overlooking the Pentagon on the
Arlington side, shows clearly that expert skills are required to first fly
into a small valley, then level out approximately 30-50 feet above ground
level. Few "expert" pilots could do this.

15.  Did a boeing really crash into the Pentagon or was it a truck packed
with explosives like the first AP reports said?

16.  Was Flight 93 shot down by fighter jets? If the plane was brought down
solely by the heroes on board, why did a passenger making a call from the
plane (while still in the air) report that he had heard an explosion?

17.  Of the companies and individuals who are involved in the brokering,
financing, contstruction and use of the Trans-Afgani Unocal pipeline, which
were party to secret US Energy Policy mettings with Vice-President Dick
Cheney?

18.  Why has the US backed the former Unocal employee Hamid Karzai as
President of the new Afghani government?

19.  How much money does Dick Cheney (as major shareholder in Halliburton)
stand to make from the completion of a trans- Afghani oil pipeline, made
possible by the ouster of the Taliban?  How much does the Bush financial
empire (including the Carlyle Group) stand to gain from the vast public
expenditures brought about by the "National Security Crisis" of 9/11?

20.  Given the absence of any DNA evidence, and the use of false passports
by the hijackers, how was the government able to come up with the list of 19
names so quickly?  Why is it that none of them appeared on the original
passenger lists of the airlines?

21.  Why is it that no one has held hearings on the FAA/DoT's role in the
9/11 debacle?

 I have always had trouble with the "first thought, best thought" motto, but
not because I'm a reviser.

 What makes one thought first and another second? Aren't all thoughts
sequential? In "first thought, best thought" logic, a second or third
thought precedes a subsequent first thought--a first thought within a
subsequent sequence, that is.   In reality, each person has only one first
thought; adults have had millions and there's no way of telling which
thought they're having now.  That is, if thoughts are discreet things...

 A more dangerous assumption is that thoughts are discreet things.  I can
conceptualize "thought" but have difficulty determining where one "thought"
ends and another starts.

 My motto is therefore "thought is thought."  It's fun, when writing a poem
or something else, merely to allow thought to happen.  As Ashbery wrote,
"Let the chips fall where they may. Leaves say it's okay."  I can't remember
what poem that's from, and I'm not going to look it up!

Dear All:

The current issue of American Poetry Review (July/August 2002) features a
special section of work by Paul Hoover. It includes an excellent essay called
"Fables of Representation: Poetry of the New York School," with sections on
"Volubility," "The Personal Lyric," "The Abstract Lyric," and "The Comic
Sublime." Hoover provides sharp and useful characterizations of the poets
under these rubrics. The essay concludes with the following comments on
Kenneth Koch: "What is all the more remarkable about Koch's poetry is that
what begins in the ridiculous ('I have a bird in my head and a pig in my
stomach / And a flower in my genitals and a tiger in my genitals' in 'Alive
for an Instant') readily asserts itself as the sublime ('summer in my
brainwater'). Undoubtedly this bridging of the comical and the sublime is
Koch's major gift to the New York School" (APR 30).
    Also included in the issue are three poems from WINTER (MIRROR),
published by Flood Editions last month.

To order WINTER (MIRROR), send a check for $13 to the following address:

I like this line, Dodie:
"I feel like I'm being played and swept along (or swept up
in) and that I have to let go of all my rationalizing bullshit.  It's a
lovely experience."

It's something I've been seeking in
these -other recent summer threads.

or Michael quoting Levinias:
"Is the poet not that which, in the
eminent sense of the term, loses place, ceases occupation, precisely, and
is thus the very opening of space...."

-----Minifestival
actually I wasn't wanting a third think so much as a cessation of thinking
and starting of writing poetry which I think comes from a different place
(in my brain or in my body) that is distinguishable

Wouldn't that just be the 1973 Manhattan phone book?

Seriously, once you get past the second generation (itself pretty diffuse),
isn't the whole NYS generation thing more conceptual than actual?  Or *is*
there a distinct cadre that has been firmly catalogued by someone or other
as a recognized NYS third wave?  Hilton Obenzinger, are you among this
group?  And where does it end?  Fourth?  Seventh?  Thirteenth?

I'm not being entirely flippant; I've always actually wondered this.  Is
Jordan Davis NYS?  How many years have to pass before the next installment
counts as a separate generation rather than an adjunct to the first?  It's
hard even to judge by the Berrigan / Padgett / Brainard model, since you
would have to establish whether you were marking the beginning of the first
gen from when Ashbery & O'Hara et al. started writing, or from when they
were first referred to as the NYS, or whatever.

Not being much help I'm afraid,

K.

I mentioned Howe because I think that some of her innovations have become
others' mannerisms.  Consider this little lyric by Wolsak:

http://www.theeastvillage.com/tc/wolsak/p5.htm

Wolsak begins in the vatic manner ("I spoke my mysteries..."), then
immediately changes tack: the "mysteries" turn out to be more of her word
collection: "tiara, muon, tot."  I.e.: the real mysteries are in language,
in words, not in the poet.  An idea closely associated with Howe.  Then a
few nonsense syllables, another Howe hallmark.  Wolsak, though, is more
self-conscious than Howe: the vaticism is cornier, and thus its
anti-romantic deflation must be more violent.  "I went up on my branch /
and sat there": this romantic nightingale isn't going to sing.  "It was I
who put the breath / within my own breath": the poet is in control, there
has been no lyric abandonment (psych!).  I think the poet knows that she is
walking a rather well-worn path, and so must give us a kind of wink to
acknowledge that her relation to her own words is partly ironic.  (The
book's title, with its mention of "spirit-like impermanences," is another
of these winks.)  Howe is never corny in this way: Howe is sincere.

I did not intend the phrase "accretive and tonally mixed" (applicable even
to this microlyric) to imply any value judgment.  I agree with DB that
coherence is not the aim of such writing.

The poet has a fine ear.  I appreciate her care with individual words, and
her sense of economy.  But I think the writing stays within some pretty
well-established boundaries.  The whole issue of mysticism and romanticism
in contemporary poetry is worth further discussion, I think, especially
vis-a-vis Devin Johnston...

The EPC "links" page (click on LINKS at the top of any EPC page) has been going through several waves of updates; of course, that page could be updated almost daily.  If you have suggestions for new inks that fall within the EPC aesthetic, write us via the form at:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/forms/link.html

Also new at the EPC, to add to the Coolidge home page (which is really spectacular, thanks to the efforts of Tom Orange), is a new home page for Keith Waldrop:
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/waldropk/

And some new images are now up (under "Paintings") at the Susan Bee's home page (some of these image files are rather large, but if you can wait out the download, well worth it):
http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bee/

Finally, in response to recent threads on the list and particularly Nick Piombino's recent posts, I've add to my home page the conversation *boundary 2* published between Geoffrey O'Brien and me on the Library of American modern poetry anthologies --

I see your point. Does this mean that we credit or discredit Kerouac for
separating literature from epistemology?

The Generations of the New York School

The Trinity.
The Fire Island Gang.
The Fire Island with Tears Gang.
Padgett/Brainerd/Berrigan/Gallup: the Tulsa Gang.
The St Marks Gang.
I was part of the Columbia Gang.
I almost joined the Bolinas Gang.
I missed out on the Naropa Gang.
I found a home in the San Francisco Gang, selling comic book porno literary=
=20
magazines in        front of Harvey Milk's camera store.
Then parts of the San Francisco Gang took on different names.
The Tulsa Gang always kicked my ass.
I will never get revenge.
I have been a gang member my entire life and I have no regrets.

There's something essentially religious about Wolsak's poetry. Her work
reaches toward ecstasy, rapture.  That's one reason why, an eternity ago, I
invoked Clement's _Syncope..._.   Dodie, as usual, was on the right track
when she linked the mystical and the orgasmic in L.W.'s writing.

Mr. Rathman seems determined to see writing as the sum of its symptoms and
attributes.  A sneeze, a dress and various fashion accessories do not a woman
make, just as poetry is more than what critics make of it. There are
synergies at work in the world at large and in Wolsak's work in particular.
You have to read her in great gulps to begin to get a sense of the larger
architectures involved.

Wolsak's work needs no defense.  And yet when I see someone so bent on
bashing it I have to ask why?  Who put that wrath in Rathman?  What's his
bullying attitude all about?  Always be nervous about the value judgments of
a critic who states that he implies no value judgments.

Aaron Belz asks:

<If anyone can point to resources or remembers a particularly relevant
passage in a book they read, please share. "culture"   "religion">

I Reply:

I've found that semioticians play quite a bit with these button words.
Essays of particular interest might be Michel De Certeau's "The
Jabbering of Social Life" and "What We Do When We Beileve"
collected in Marshall Blonsky's _On Signs_. Actually, the whole book
is interesting. Even if it/they aren't particularly helpful, it is/they are
still interesting reading . . . almost fun, in fact!

If I had any credentials, I would love to be slotted in here under "Ashbery
3.0."

Actually it sounds like software.  I wish the Ashbery company would send
installer CDs in the mail: TRY 30 DAYS FREE.

I am John Ashbery.  My whole work as a poet is an attempt to escape his
influence without losing my soul.

Michael Rothenberg penned the statement:

>
> which came first, the chicken or the egg?


Michael,

I sense this was facetious or dashed-off, so I won't take it too seriously.
But I do think the chicken/egg analogy falls prey to the same epistemic
error as the first thought/second thought analogy.  Thoughts aren't really
like a succession of chickens.

Thought is a singular entity, more like water; it flows. It seeks its depth
by pressure.  Admittedly people do say "waters" but I think that expression
is poetical. Like "See the Mississip-- her waters a-shining--" etc.

I like Ashbery's connection of language to a river in "Myrtle."  I see the
same connection between language's object (thought) and water.

I like to think of thoughts as a succession of chickens, though, but not
because it is a true analogy, but because it is a delightful image.

-Aaron


P.S. I spent the earliest part of my life very close to a large egg farm of
perhaps 1200 hens, in eastern Iowa.  It smelled very, very nasty. That's one
thing you learn growing up next to a chicken farm is how bad chicken dung
actually smells.  Finally the Amish came and disassembled the coop bolt by
bolt-- as I understand it, they don't believe in power tools.

You could note the sequence of the phrase "First thought, best thought"
is characterized by the comma. (I'm not going to talk about parataxis).

There really is an extension going on from initial 'instance' to
embodied 'use.' (be-bop)

Neoteny. The evolution is in the retention. You could talk to Ed Sanders
about this. Maybe Robert Creeley.

Call me Bud Powell.

Arron,


I took Michael's quip as just that, a quip against something very
personal that one must come to within themselves (inner personal trust,
maybe) to know which phrase is correct. Derek calls his eyes on the comma
which is not an equal sign as you hope it might be. There is no thought
first or second, now is there? Or is there?

I've eaten both chickens and eggs - both roast fine in brown butter

Best, Geoffrey

ANTENNAE PERFORMANCE (music and poetry from ANTENNAE, a biannual journal of
experimental poetry and music) & THE RACE

9 PM
JULY 12
$5
at the CHASE CAFE (7301 North Sheridan, Rogers Park, Chicago - three blocks

ANTENNAE. The works, a variety both discordant and sympathetic, will be
positioned within the performance space and time in the interests of the
individual pieces and the dialogues they potentially instigate.

Following the Antennae performance, Chicago rock bank THE RACE will play.

Aaron,

I think I'm in the Koch lineage somewhere.
Not sure what number.  Somewhere before Davis.

What do you think?

First Thought:
Well, Ashbery's newest book IS titled _Your Name Here_, maybe we
all have a shot? I'll take 6.334, please. (No need to wrap it, I'll eat it
here.)

Second Thought:
There's nobody here but us chickens.

Best Thought:
I wouldn't want to belong to any group that would have me as a
member. (Something like that, at any rate. Or maybe, last night I shot
an elephant in my pajamas. How it got into my pajamas I'll never
know.)

Langpo is famously obsessed with theory and lacking in humor, is how I hear
it. At least nobody ever called Frank O'Hara a "Stalinist thug."

Another version is that NY School poets always come from exotic places like
Tulsa. A typical NY School accent belongs to Lee Ann Brown. Each generation
is required to include one or two locals, on principle.

All of the language poets read all of the NY School poets. Some of the NY
School poets read some of the language poets.

Everybody agrees that Anselm Hollo is terrific.

There are two N's in Rathmann, BeckeTT.  I don't mind the ad hominem stuff,
but misspellings rile the spirits of the ancestors.  Hate having to placate
those suckers.

"Bashing"?  You mean, like, having mixed feelings, expressing skepticism,
being of two minds?  That sort of bashing?

Or maybe the Rapture has left me behind.  "He was just sitting there
reading...I don't know what it was, a book of poetry I think...when
suddenly he JUST DISAPPEARED..."  Cerebral orgasmic?  Yikes Bellamy (two
L's, I see...).  How about, "Better than crack"?  (Readers, get ready for
just a minor letdown...)  It's a good book, but overselling it won't help
its fortunes.

Of course Lissa (!) Wolsak's poetry "needs no defense."  So what's with all
the defensiveness?  Sheesh.  Upton's going to have a conniption, sounds
like.

I mean reductive criticism that seems aimed at trashing someone rather than
illuminating something.  I think you've taken some cheap shots recently on
this List-in re: Wolsak, Armantrout and others-- and that  it hasn't gone
unnoticed.  However you spell your name.  Funny how you can dish it out but
get a little wild when you're questioned.  What's your nn game?

Some years ago, in the days of the power of Margaret Thatcher, there was a
cartoon by the British cartoonist Steve Bell. He imagined the Expensive
Leader meeting with a minister - Edwina Currie - who had recently said
something embarrassing - she'd shown contempt for others, actually

Thatcher: Now Edwina, what do we do when we are called to account?

Currie: Talk bollocks, Prime Minister?

Thatcher: Very good, Edwina. When we are called to account, we talk
bollocks.

and then they practice uttering all sorts of irrelevancies, pretend outrage,
non sequiturs, empty rhetoric

I have thought of that cartoon through the years of exponential growth,
unlimited wealth, murder in the name of freedom and on into these finite
dangerous times.  It has illuminated many public speeches.

Do you know the phrase "Throw a wobbly?", Andrew. I'm not sure if it's
USAmerican. In case not, it means - apart from "mentally falling apart" - to
behave oddly, shout a bit, act ruffled, cuss a little, sneer at one's
detractors without actually answering them; it comes in a variety of
flavours, all of them artificial. Except when it means *really falling
apart, it's a kneejerk diversionary tactic, always.

Conceptually,it's content free. Anything that makes a noise will do. The
misspelling of one's name is a good starting point, anything on which one
can claim offence; or conflating 2 different criticisms is another. Using
tags like "ad hominem" is a bit of a long shot  - very few manage benefit of
clergy nowadays, but you never know

& I envisage a coda to that cartoon

MInd 1: But what do I do if I'm caught out talking bollocks?

Mind 2: Throw a wobbly

May the false be with you

Since time immorial one of the functions of criticism has been to whet
readers' appetites for those people amd works panned.  At least that's the
way it works for me in my memory going back to high school.

So now with appetite whet I'm interested in further leads on Wolsak,
syncope, the spiritual, etc.

You shouldn't need any acid to play Arteroids. It has not been tested under those conditions.
Though it doesn't sound like a bad idea.

By the way, there's an MP3 of a recording I made of a game of Arteroids at level 216 in Play
Mode at http://vispo.com/arteroids/sounds/Full_Arteroids_2_Recording.mp3 . Sort of between
cartoon, sound poetry, and Gregory Whitehead.

Subject:      Domain names - clearing the fog
Comments: To: edit@jacketmagazine.com
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I've realised that not everybody understands what it means to own a domain
name. A recent correspondent said:

"I can't see any difference between paying an [Internet Service Provider,
or "ISP"] to give you an email address and paying them to host your domain
name, except that the latter is more expensive. You are still at the mercy
of your ISP [....] no matter what you do....."

Well, there is a simple, essential difference: with an ISP's email service
-- let's call them "Greedy.com ISP" -- your email address refers to the
domain name *they* own, and is usually something like

        josephine@greedy.com

When you get sick of Greedy.com because they're unreliable, and change to
Kindly.com, you have to tell all your friends that your email address is now

        josephine.smith@kindly.com         (the "josephine"s were all taken)

...and they have to go through the nuisance of changing their address books.

Then when Kindly.com's generosity sends them broke, you have find another
Internet Service provider -- let's say "Bubble Investments" -- and then you
have to tell all your friends that your email address is now

        josephineKVX99A@bubble.com        (The name "josephine.smith" was already
taken)

...and they have to go through the nuisance of changing their address
books. And so on.

But when you own your own domain name, say "josephine.com", your email
address will always be something like

        me@josephine.com

...no matter which ISP is handling your accounts for you.

You take this single email address with you, wherever you go, and whichever
ISP you choose to use, for *the rest of your life*. You never have to
change it again, and you never need to make a nuisance of yourself by
asking your friends to change their address books ever again. (As long as
you remember to keep your subscription to your domain name ownership paid
up.) Get it?

Q: I thought having a doman name meant that you had to have your own web site?

A: No, no! With your own domain name, you *can* set up your own web site
(with that name) and ask your ISP to host it for you, but you don't have to
do that. You can just use the domain name for a personal email address, and
nothing more, if you wish; of course you need to ask your ISP to host
*that* for you, but that isn't difficult, and it's not visible to people
who send mail to you. Mail to me at <edit@jacketmagazine.com> is actually
routed via a server with the internet address <mangalore.zipworld.com.au>,
but I don't have to know that, and nor does anyone else. My ISP looks after
that.

Domain names are managed by ICANN;  The Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers.  ICANN is a technical coordination body for the
Internet. Created in October 1998 by a broad coalition of the Internet's
business, technical, academic, and user communities, ICANN is assuming
responsibility for a set of technical functions previously performed under
U.S. government contract by IANA and other groups.  Here's their list of
ICANN's accredited Domain Name Registrars:
http://www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html

Lots of helpful information about how to obtain a domain name, and why a
"domain name" is different from an "Internet service provider" is given
here at the site of Internic, a domain name registrar:
http://www.internic.net/faqs/domain-names.html

Just because you live in the United Kingdom or Australia or Canada doesn't
mean that you have to register your domain name in those countries and end
up with a domain name ending in "uk" or "au" or "cn". Anyone fromAlaska to
Zanzibar can register a simple domain name in the US (such as
"jacketmagazine.com") via the Internet and a credit card. And it's usually
cheaper!

And you don't have to accept those pesky "www's" at the start of your name.
I insisted on not having them, and it works.

Sorry to take up your mental bandwidth about this; but it does seem a
tangled issue for many people, and a great nuisance when it goes wrong, as
it did for the more than five million friends of more than 630,000 AT&T
customers who were recently forced to make changes to all their address books.

Now -- no more on domain names.
best wishes,

All this stuff about "New York School: The Third Generation" is  failing to
take into account a vital set of parameters first outlined by Professor
Winkleschnippe of Leyden, relating to the structural dynamics of the
typical late-twentieth-century North American poetry career.

For the month of July, I will be sending an annoying number
of publication announcements, enjoy!

-----------
Cosmopolitan Tremble by Mark Ducharme
80 pages
8 by 9 format
ISBN: 1-886350-96-5 paper $12


Mark DuCharme's first full length collection includes poems which first
appeared in ACM, Boulder Planet, Combo, Dead Metaphor Press Broadside,
The Gertrude Stein Awards in Innovative American Poetry: 1994-1995,
ixnay, Kenning, lower limit speech, Misc Proj, Pavement Saw, The Poets'
Calendar for the Millennium, Ribot, Shiny, Situation, and Talisman as
well as in the chapbook _Desire Series_ from Dead Metaphor Press (1999).

Behold the multitude of forms that dance through the streets of this
osmopolis!  Free agent Mark DuCharme is the architect of an awesome city
of words sometimes tender, sometimes tough, always wonderful to wander
through.   --Lisa Jarnot

Mark Du Charme’s poems in COSMOPOLITAN TREMBLE say astonishing things.
That is the “business” of poems: to say astonishing things.  Some poems
say astonishing things once in a while, some with greater frequency,
some hardly ever.  Of course, it all depends on what the reader may or
may not find astonishing.  Some readers may be more easily astonished
than some
others. Personally, I don’t think I am all that easily astonished.  To
get back
to the subject of this note, I find that Mark Du Charme’s poems say
astonishing things practically ALL THE TIME !  By that I mean that they
really keep me awake.  From the expansive vistas of the title sequence,
on through the more jagged and mysterious ones of <Desire Series> and
the cinema noir of <X (secret fuel)>, to the coda of <Anything It Could
Be>, Mark Du Charme
takes us on a Long March, a Wild Trip, a Civilized Orgy of Cognitive
Dissonance, whatever that means, well it means these poems are great
serious fun to read and reread, and I urge you to do so.   --Anselm
Hollo

The domestic is a crash test in Mark DuCharme's party-of-the-first-part
telling.  He outs "Genders of the obvious" and gets into "Gestures
capped in answerable wool."  The "desire" in this series is warier than
that of, say, Barthes, where it is "taxidermy" which is "lovely" and
where "The heart being nothing/ Agitates slightly."   --Michael Gizzi

Zip and sharp wit drive this new collection of Mark DuCharme's. It's a
brainy engagement with the real world expanded by the forces of language

-- "In weather's pearlish mystery," "In purer emblems of a tumbling
incitement," "In the genre of kissing or falling down," DuCharme finds a

world full of acute emotion and vivid experience, and recounts it with a

freshness you can almost hear aloud.  --Cole Swensen

Winner of the 2000 Transcontinental Poetry Award
for an outstanding first book-length collection of poetry or prose

Jeffrey Levine has won the Larry Levis Prize from The Missouri Review
and the James Hearst Award from North American Review. His poems have
appeared in Antioch Review, Barrow Street, Beloit Poetry Review,
Ploughshares, Poetry International, Quarterly West, and elsewhere. He is

Editor-in-Chief of Tupelo Press, an independent literary press located
in Dorset, VT.

The poems appeared in many journals, including: The Alembic, The Antioch

Review, The Beloit Poetry Journal, Barrow Street, Cimarron Review, Crab
Orchard Review, The Emily Dickinson Award Anthology, 5 AM,
ForPoetry.com, GSU Review, Hayden’s Ferry Review, The Kerf, Kestrel,
Luna, Many Mountains Moving, Mississippi Review, Missouri Review,
Nimrod, North American Review, Notre Dame Review, Poetry International,
Ploughshares, Quarter After Eight, Quarterly West, Virginia Quarterly
Review, Yankee Magazine. “Dawn With Cardinals,” and “One month before
his 50th birthday,” were republished on Poetry Daily
(www.poems.com).“Dawn, With Cardinals,” “One month before his 50th
birthday,” “Penelope Draws From Life,” “Telemachus in San Miguel,” and
“Turns Out Circe Has Something of a Past” were awarded the 1999 Larry
Levis Award by the editors of The Missouri Review.


Mortal, Everlasting offers poems which are measured, patient, musical,
witty, serious, formal in feeling, and totally human. These poems create

enchanted spaces rich in memory and imagination — all we have to draw
our surest knowledge from. Levine will tell you why God trusts none of
us, that He is not religious, and that ‘we are as easily hidden from as
seen.’ We learn the secret history of Odysseus and his family, and what
Circe and Van Gogh do on their vacations. Poetry makes us privy to an
understanding not even      contained in the lines of the poem, but only

in our responses to them. This book is a telling of marvels.
               Howard McCord, Contest Judge

The poems of Jeffrey Levine honor language in ways few poets can. By
honor, I mean the presence of the poet is welcome through the tension
between  experience and perception. The result is a book of magnificent
voices, awareness, and sheer triumph. Reading Jeffrey Levine’s poems, I
am reminded that the moment poetry takes over our lives is the instant
we know there is no going back.
           Ray Gonzalez

A melancholy chronicle of love and loss, Jeffrey Levine’s effusive first

poems spill over with sentiment and lush aural pleasures. His ‘art-full’

persona poems are part parody, part pathos, filled with gentle,
self-depricating wit, and his re-figuring Greek myth as every man makes
the poet a little more heroic, the Gods a little more human. If the
poems are rueful, they’re rueful like the Brahms’ clarinet Quintet:
there’s   pleasure in the sadness and sadness in the pleasure.
                   Ira Sadoff

Jeffrey Levine’s poems read like brilliant jazz riffs played by a master

classical musician. They sing. They sway. They swing.
              Thomas Lux

Oh, I think it goes further than that. Ashbery and Koch wrote Lango before LangPo was defined. Most of East Coast Langpoets are the offshoot of  NY School tree. There are obvious reasons for each generation to recast itself as the first-generation Something, as opposite to the third-generation Anything. So if it's hard for somebody to tell the difference, i would say they got it right :-)

p.s. and that's why we have now Elliptical Poets instead of the 3rd generation LanPo or 5th (?) generation NY School.

Wanting to confer on the word-complexes <culture> and <religion>, and resp=
onding to Aaron Belz's inquiry <...i am conducting studies on the words...=
>, David Larsen wrote

culture =3D farming
religion =3D re-reading.

   That is true. It makes sense, but it will satisfy few people further th=
an a tautological synonym would. Do we know what farming is=3F Do we know wh=
at reading is, let alone the <re-> repeatedly involved=3F
    At worst, this politely correct and witty equation looks like resting =
in an authentic idyll of leisurely feed production and pleasurely read ren=
ewing consumption. On the positive side, though, the equations properly co=
mbine a sense of harmonious comfort with responsible criticism. (Politics,=
 that is.)
   The pithy definition is also along the lines of  <great> means <fucking=
 fantastic!> (Well, one may think of a virgin <great with child>, of a pha=
ntom pregnancy or of a megalomanic purity complex, Miss Tickle, all swolle=
n with a ghostly, spiritual <bearing>.)

    So. Wanting to chat on this, here goes something off the top of my hea=
d. (Minerva fully armed!)
   Saying <culture =3D farming> involves a curious metonymy, like saying cul=
ture equals agriculture, or culture equals horticulture &c. No more helpfu=
l than saying that <poiesis> mean making =96 singularly poetic.
   <Culture> certainly involves the cut, the opening of the ground and the=
 pruning of bearing trees. Cult equals sect, not only in being a select, a=
 <particular> religious practice, but as an act of separation. The word ap=
pears early associated with a Venus of gardening and goes for the graceful=
ly adorned, ordinate, the <arranged>, cosmetic & mundane, the plainly beau=
tiful. Cultus: veneration, reverence, nursing , caring =96 both building and=
 maintaining.
   There is a clearing of the forest, the ditch dredged and Roman walls ra=
ised. Enlightening clarity: the fixing of the fine, the nice, the <artific=
ial>, well done. The settling of hunters and gatherers, the setting of nom=
adic pastoral, cyclopean cycle. Status. <Neolithic revolution> making the =
city stone enclosure of the gods, from steppe to temple stoop.
   The queen of vending and vengeance, no doubt the sweet, the fruit, of v=
anity and the vine, Dione=92s poultry honking on the Capital, goes both with=
 grafting and the slitting of sacrificial throats. Venus and all the Dione=
s give us <self-satisfaction>, a booty killed-sure, <clean slayne> (Pound)=
. Hey Hey. Jerkin Beef.
   This beauty requires <Adoration>, which meant a gift of crops, ears of =
grain (named after a type of spellt), a word which subsequently covered a =
<speaking out>, a performative prayer or spell for the ears of gods. The r=
eading and cultivation of the divine: divining. To preserve, to <cultivate=
 the stable letter> (H=F6lderlin), is to <cut off>, to make static. Statemen=
t.

    This is perhaps a place for reconsidering the <sacred>. Think of this =
as meaning revolting, frightening, awesome-awful, sickening, turning the s=
tomach, plain bad, totalitarian. As it is. It is nearly meaningless to say=
 <everything is bad>. Not all (PACE poets from Blake to Bernstein) is sacr=
ed. This category is the condition for the possibilty of making any distin=
ctions at all.
   Taste crops up in discussion and disgust. The cruel, the truly confusin=
g, though: maybe a word for it is <nature>, which as in culture and all it=
s manifested mini-cultures (horti- & seri- &c) is in a metonymic slide wit=
h <nurture>. Nature both includes and is distinct from this care. She appe=
ars a goddess too (as the <physical>, being both growing and building and =
e-ducating =96 and telling us the difference). The great Non-Holy, if you li=
ke, which punches out and punctures the outer line of <everything that liv=
es> as auto-poietic. The author herself has no life.
   Slight twists like this may make those banal words worth thinking about=
 again. Nothing nice about this chasm. If it is the given, how do we take =
it=3F Can we relink it, or relinquish it=3F

   The word <religion> has quite a popular etymology, going back to St Aug=
ustine=92s interpretation, as a re-binding: as in ligament, joining or tied =
again to gods, powers or holy life one has been cut off from. Reunion. (Ch=
ained to the <rock>, if not in the <cave>.) Most dictionaries, though, adv=
isedly correct this provenance of the word, and prefer <re-legare>: which =
is gathering again, gleaning, collecting, picking, choosing and, yes, read=
ing. Germanic <read> is also both to consider, advise and to achieve. Lega=
re also as in laws, laid down to be taken up. Laying and relaying.=20
   Reading is already <picking up> and <putting down> (words worth listeni=
ng to), again and again and again. Stasis, relegated. At best, <re-ligion>=
 might suggest taking and taking back: that is forgiving.

    How can this be concluded=3F The reading is <prepared>, ready, cut and r=
eapplied, sire and scion sliced and spliced, grafted already in the double=
 rent and tuck of cult. To adopt some deconstructive terms: the adorning t=
reatment, <trace of writing>, is its withdrawal in the re-take of religion=
.
   The popular opposition of the <cultural> (haughty, of course, high vest=
ed and harvested) to shabby civilization (or to the market, the electorate=
, pornography or whatever), matches the false reunion envisaged by the uni=
versal church in the concept <religion>. Abandoning the fallen empty hulls=
, union confirms the split. This opposition (is it competition or is it co=
ncurrence=3F) has had a bit of ideological history in the conflict between B=
LOOD  (organic unified, soiling soulful)  and bureaucratic INK (matter mec=
hanical, whose name is legion).
   It is not at all clear to me that there is any meaningful difference be=
tween separation and return, coulter and copulation. As in egg and chicken=
, red roe and trout, theory and practice, vision and voice, poetic and cri=
tic (oedipal hommage, aporetic paltry hommelet): is <peace> the root of pa=
ct, or is a deal, a contract, a packed court the graft root of peace=3F

   Pardon the expansion. This always happens when you try and narrow meani=
ngs down.

Just to express my dismay at the flak being tossed Andrew Rathmann's way
for what I consider a model (and seemingly tireless) approach to the
problem of un- and under-reviewed books, done in a way that broaches
larger concerns of generational change and method. I don't see the
"bashing" or "trashing"s in Rathmann's work that Tom Beckett does, and I
think Beckett undercuts a fair argument regarding Wolsak's "larger
architectures" by falling into that lingo. If Beckett thinks Rathmann's
fault is in being "determined to see writing as the sum of its symptoms
and attributes," I'd reply that, at the very least, Rathmann is careful to
characterize and specify what he sees, rather than hanging a whole body of
work off some sky-hook like "cerebral/orgiastic mysticism" (Bellamy) or
wobbling anecdotally and inchoately on (Upton).

My own initial response to Rathmann's "Pen Chants" post had mostly to do
with a questions of diction and music and the claim that "istle, finochio,
ixia" is "the verbal equivalent of someone's rock collection." I'm always
concerned (being a collector myself) when something that could be
construed as a defense of "plain style" or "clarity" or "limiting one's
palette to primaries" comes up. The line in question here, to me, proceeds
with a stumbling kind of music. It doesn't much matter what the words
"mean," but how they rustle and pause together is of great evocative
interest. If I cast around for a similar example of lines proceeding by
music, I land oddly enough on Roethke's "sidelong pickerel smile,"
smoother rhythmically, stretching longer, but balanced on the terminal
long i's in a similar way to the short i's of the Wolsak, and with the
words' discrete "meanings" mattering about as much.

Great! Thanks for the added information, this looks like it's just
around the corner from where I live. Though I doubt it, cause that's
a residential block of pretty small houses here in Fort Worth.

Perhaps you could send out something letting us know what city this
is in. Or maybe that's the Secret of Secret Lunch Productions.

Cordially! Uninformed! I am!

My objection to Andrew Rathmann's commentary upon _Pen Chants_ is that he
offered unsubstantiated opinion as proven fact. You answer this with your
own unsubstantiated opinion that his approach is "model".

*I am dismayed that a doubtful opinion was advanced as criticism, but am the
more dismayed that the response to objection is "So?"

Perhaps you formed your opinion tirelessly, as you tell us Andrew Rathmann
formed his. Is this a claim for an exemption from the need for substance? (I
know this isn't very good, but I spent a long time on it.)

& I am almost as dismayed by your misreading of "orgiastic" for "orgasmic".
I know the words look a bit the same; and perhaps, to some, they seem
similar in meaning; but they're not, you know. Superficial similarities can
be misleading, as has already been noted.

This does not reflect well upon your powers of Close Reading and may have
implications for you personally which I prefer not to dwell upon.

I am surprised at being called "inchoate". Was I really? Ah well. I was
trying to communicate only one idea, that evidence is needed to validate an
opinion. I didn't mean to overload you and give up now.

Hello

As part of the Incubation conference, you are invited to join us for a live=
 online chat event run by the trAce Online Writing Centre in collaboration =
with ISEA, Fine Art Forum & The Electronic Literature Organization.
It's on Monday 15th July,  9 pm UK time. If you can't come to the Incubatio=
n conference in person, be there in electronic spirit: join us in LinguaMOO=
=2E  (full details below)

We are also pleased to announce the Incubation Gallery, this year curated b=
y Mez, whose pioneering net.language &#8216;mezangelle&#8217; has intrigued=
 readers online since the early 90s. In her introduction to this selection =
of works titled _Net & Codeworkers Inc[ubation]_ and chosen specifically fo=
r the web, Mez explains why codework can only be fully experienced in a non=
-physical space.  Mez will be a guest at the online chat to talk a little a=
bout her choices.

The Gallery is at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation/gallery.cfm
Incubation website: http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/incubation

***

The Live Chat event at Incubation is organised in collaboration with ISEA (=
Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts; http://www.isea.qc.ca/), fine Art fo=
rum (http://www.fineartforum.org/) and the Electronic Literature Organizati=
on (http://www.eliterature.org/).

Chaired online by Deena Larsen, invited guests include Linda Carroli and Al=
an Sondheim as well as Mez.
A bit different from the usual chats, this will be chaired by Helen Whitehe=
ad at Incubation in front of a live audience of Incubation delegates who wi=
ll contribute via a live discussion which will be transmitted via a typist =
into LinguaMOO.

Communicate and hobnob with your creative counterparts as part of a series =
of online meetings at real life conferences to help bring members of the cr=
eative electronic community together. We will talk about important points i=
n the conference and foster relationships between online writers and artist=
s with questions such as:

**How can we use the online environment to further collaborations between a=
rtists and writers?

**How do the online environment and other new media tools modify the relati=
onship between writing, language, imagery, culture, and ethnicity?

**How has online communication and coordination changed art and writing?

**How are lines between art and literature blurring?

**What new ways are we using to communicate with art and writing?

Howdy folks,

Have been following this New York School thread.  It seems pathetic and
predictable to me that the thread, like so many before it, was used as a
platform from which to take pot shots at Language Poetry. The anxiety
which the word "LangPo" produces in poets of many ilks just seems crazy to
me and, anyway, horribly belated, -- and a big waste of time that might
otherwise be spent writing poems or reading them or doing something else
of fun and/or value, but surely not complaining about Language Poetry!
Sheesh, save some time and buy the classic recordings.  I recommend
"LangPo is a New York School Derivative" and "LangPo is French Theory
Mumbo-Jumbo Designed to Procure Academic Jobs," both very groovy.

No doubt there are interesting connections between various writers
identified as New York School and various writers identified as Language
Writers but unless one speaks of specifics what's the point?  Are we poets
or guests on a rigged daytime talkshow?  I'd like to hear, for instance,
people's opinions on Perelman as a (skeptical but engaged) reader of
O'Hara, as in the following from "The Manchurian Candidate: A Remake":

The Chinese Mastermind. . .

        knows how to get in bed with capital
and let it charm his pants off.
Having them "tight enough
so everyone will want to go to bed with you,"
as Frank O'Hara writes, is a youthful gesture
under the dappled shade of capital's
frond-like pleasances.

That's one thing.
But to live as a large system of control is quite another.

Anyway, I'd much rather hear someone's thoughts on this.  A critique of
O'Hara's ethos to one degree or another and yet aesthetically it owes
O'Hara quite a bit, right? ("That's one thing") as I suspect Perelman
knows and intends.

There are a lot of other poets you might put in your NYS/LangPo comparison
of the same quality as those I've mentioned and something ought to be
written about how this affects you when you write poetry.

As for New York School 3.0, anyone who would actually want to be
identified as such would necessarily have to be lacking in the inventive
spirit of the original poets to be so-called (by *others* as has already
been mentioned).  Likewise, from a different angle, there are plenty of
critics out there who will praise, say, Ashbery *now* - when it's
perfectly easy to do (even without reading the work!)  - but have no
interest at all in poets of the present moment who's work (vis a vis
contemporary poetry) is analogous to Ashbery's early work (vis a vis *his*
contemporaries).  To paraphrase Emerson, they praise Ashbery but it is a
past Ashbery their minds can entertain; a present Ashbery they would
denounce.  Hence Harold Bloom couldn't pick K. Silem Mohammad or Jennifer
Moxley out of a line-up.

As a young writer it's certainly nice to feel included in the "family"
with writers you admire, to be 3.0 as it were.  Ashbery once told me that
my head was roughly the size and shape of O'Hara's (i.e. an irish
melon-head, literally or figuratively, you decide), an observation which
damn near converted me to Phrenology.  Outside of a specific discussion of
specific poems, this is as good as, indeed roughly the same as, being
called "3.0."  But what we really need is the poems discussed as *active
material.*  Not another lien on the estate.

Lawrence,

This is quite amusing.

As Lawrence pointed out, I did, indeed, write cerebral/orgasmic
mysticism (not that I have any problems with the orgiastic, it's a
fine word/concept, but it's not what I intended here).  Someone else,
was it AR?, seemed to think I made such a comment as a value
judgement, but, actually, it was descriptive of what I saw in the
work as a breakdown in western civ's dividing intellect, sexuality,
and spirituality into separate, distinct categories.  I think much of
what's interesting in Lissa's work (and Lissa as a person) is how
these categories blur and confuse.  She throws us off-kilter.
Declaring my observation a "sky-hook" is a form of name calling--not
a very civilized gesture for someone so actively claiming a rational
stance.

I think that at the bottom of this discussion is different levels of
need for categorization.  I'm reminded of the talk Joan Retallack
gave at Naropa last week--and anything I say about the talk has
filtered through my quirky excitations, so I wouldn't hold Joan
accountable for what I'm about to say.  But she was talking about
surprise and chance as strategies in art--and the wonderful
coincidences that can arise.  She talked about the chaos of everyday
life and how that can generate anxiety, and how one of the functions
of genres is to give order to the chaos, to reduce the anxiety.  I
think Lissa's work, in resisting some of the categories developed and
clung to by various people on the list, has created a certain amount
of anxiety.  Therefore she and I (with my messy terms) need to be
attacked.  Order needs to be restored.  You can see the same process
in 50s horror flicks.  Attack of the Giant Ants.  Get out the bombs.

and Language Poets are singularly without sarcasm, and unlike NYS Poets do
not write things that refer to inside jokes because langpo is universal
whereas NYS poetry applies only on Fire Island, and even there, only on the
Beach side, not on the Bay side, especially at the hour of sunrise when the
sun is red.

Langpo is famously obsessed with theory and lacking in humor, is how I hear
it. At least nobody ever called Frank O'Hara a "Stalinist thug."

Another version is that NY School poets always come from exotic places like
Tulsa. A typical NY School accent belongs to Lee Ann Brown. Each generation
is required to include one or two locals, on principle.

All of the language poets read all of the NY School poets. Some of the NY
School poets read some of the language poets.

Everybody agrees that Anselm Hollo is terrific.

Throwing this in here mainly because it interests me but it may be relevant
to the anxiety mentioned and also relate to earlier list discussions:

Life is chaos and it's human nature to categorize and make sense of it.  In
times of crisis (and I think 'crisis' pre-dated last September's 'attack')
order needs to be restored but it need not be a return to the old order that
didn't hold.  It could be a poetic order that for the expression of
intellect/spirit/physical-sexual impulses together rather than
comparmentally [I'm not sure if this is a word or if I invented it in my
late night thinking here.]

>From an exclusive pavement saw listserve interview with Tony Gloeggler:

DB: Many people think you are the basketball poet of our generation.
What constitues a great basketball poet?

Tony Gloeggler: "To begin with you would have to rather play basketball
than write or read poetry even now when you are old and slow on the
court.  It would help if you wanted to be Dr. J, the Dr. J when he was
flying through the ABA with his pumped up Afro, when you grew up and
then you have to play, write a lot."

"A good basketball poet can go both right and left and can break down
his man. He plays tough, tight-to-the-skin D, boxes out well, rebounds
in a crowd. He can see the whole court, find the open man and hit an
open jumper."

"A great basketball poet is fundamentally sound, but shows you something

new every time he steps on the court.  He makes the people around him
better and wants the ball when the game is on the line."

Some of these poems first appeared in Bogg, Bottomfish, Chiron Review,
Coal City Review, 5AM, Graffiti Rag, The Ledge, Mangrove, Manhattan
Poetry Review, The Montserrat Review, Mudfish, The New York Quarterly,
One Trick Pony, Pavement Saw, Pearl, Potato Eyes, Puerto Del Sol, Rain
City Review, Rattle, River City, Urbanus, West Branch, Wisconsin Review
and Yellow Silk. The following were anthologized: “Rock N Roll” in
Essential Love (Poetworks, An Imprint of Grayson Books, 2000), “One On
One” in Full Court: A Literary Anthology of Basketball (Breakaway Books,

1996); “Quincy, California” and “Midnight” in SPLIT VERSE (Midmarch Arts

Press, 2000); and “Lucky” in The Cancer Poetry Project (Fairview Press,
2001).


"Gloeggler's poetry is a harsh music, dissonant and true. These are rock

'n roll songs of love and lust, of the persistence of lonliness and the
power of memory. A book with duende to spare, One Wish Left takes us
into Bruce Springsteen's 'darkness on the edge of town' and offers us
his battered valentines." -- Kim Addonizio

A non basketball poem from One Wish Left:


Coffee


I never told anyone
how you crept into my bed
when thunder cracked and wind
whipped wet branches against bricks
or when creaky pipes were burglars
sneaking up hallway stairs

How we hid under covers
held each other close
when daddy came home late
and mom called him a drunken bum
and he said he couldn’t stay
in the damn house staring
at her fat face every night
and she screamed go to hell
and he yelled don’t you ever
raise your voice to me again
and she cried let go of my hair
Johnny please don’t hit me
and he said just shut up
you fucking bitch
and fix us some coffee

And you went back to your bed
started to breathe easy
sigh even sleep sounds
as that rich dark smell
crept under the door
and filled the bedroom


"I would love to keep these poems to myself, to clutch them to me secure

in the knowledge that there is someone somewhere who gets it, someone
who can translate the staccato beat of a basketball on the blacktop, the

sweeping touch of a lover's hand, the sweat sparked by hard honest work,

the myriad insecurities that rumble beneath the surface of our lives.
Tony Gloeggler is that person. His tough, lyrical language stuns and
excites. He's just too damned good to be a secret." --Patricia Smith


"Tony Gloeggler's poems are full of wonder, good humor, and soul. They
hold nothing back. They hit home, one after another, creating a world in

full color, full volume, full sweat and tears, full court, full-tilt
boogie."  -- Jim Daniels

I was writing email and all of a sudden this story about tragic love with
horses came out onto the screen.  I don't know what evil genii got into me.
I don't know why.  Someone else had brought up bestiality on a list and I
thought of this scenario (the first paragraoh) and then I kept going, and i
just added the blurbs as an afterthought.  I really can't illustrate it
because it would be obscene amd I have no talent for that kind of thing as
my drawings tend to look like cartoons even when I don't want them to.  I
suppose I could create the soundtrack for this -- the famous horse fucking
rock itself, but I'd be almost embarrassed to do so, even alone in my own
aparment.

_Horse-Fucking Rock_, the next bestseller

Blurb:

This comic novel recounts the life and death of Michelle Messier, a
beautiful, blonde, 25-year-old mergers and acquisitions specialist who stole
a police horse for her nightly sexual pleasures while rapidly ascending the
career ladder at Salomon Brothers.  After the neighbors directly below her
Penthouse apartment on 5th and and 20th complained of the "strangely primal
but antithetical to sleeping noises" that emanated from their ceiling at
night, she explained that it was a new genre of music, horse-fucking rock,
meant to shock, very chic, just the latest trend from Germany.  The
neighbors wanted a a CD burned for them too, because they could never bear
to be behind anyone, so she recorded a night of hot horse sex, and gave them
a CD.

[THRILLING! The next movie classic!  --- Yellow Silk]

Unfortunately, when they played the CD in their apartment so that it came up
through the floorboiards and the pipes, MIchelle's horse got so excited that
it trampled her but the people downstairs thought the screaming was new cut
qnd not a real emergency until they saw, to their horror, a hoof come
through the ceiling, next to the chandelier.  They too, were business types
and they realized that if she died, the horse-fucking rock CD would be an
underground classic, and that they could make millions on it.  The man also
quickly  took a photo of the hoof and the chandelier with his high-end
digital camera; he had a web site in mind for a design competition which
sought "edgy" work and usually there was nothing edgy about him.  He was a
bond salesman.  Not even a bond fund salsman, where there are market forces
involved, but just plain bonds, and he rarely sold any because they could
only be bought in large denominations and you can't get someone to lay down
$10,000 for a T-Bill just by saying, "You're safe with Bonds.  Bonds don't
change."  This was his only sales slogan, original to him, he thought, and
he was rather proud of it.  But on the side he did photography of trite and
sentimental subjects and he made web sites with no originality whatsoever.

[BUY IT NOW BEFIRE THEY BAN IT!  HILARIOUS!  EXCELLENT SOCIAL SATIRE!  --
Village Voice]

But that hoof, that very phallic hoof, penetrating his dining room and
wiggling around most arousingly set free his imagination and he all of a
sudden he found he had a creative mind after all.  Unfortunately, just as he
was coming to this pleasant epiphany, the man was fatally crushed by the
horse when it fell into their apartment (the horse was unscathed and having
the time of it's life, if its mood could be measured in inches).  The wife
kicked aside her husband's body and tried to make out with the horse,
Unfortunately, this is when the police arrived, and they recognized their
horse Fred, and were none too happy that it had been forced ito prostutution
and fed breakdfast cereal because horse feed would have attracted attention.
The police took Fred, and spent a long time checking him over, paticularly
on one particulart part, as if woman made a stain. and they talked about
having the vet chck for diseases.   Then they arrested the wife for horse
pornography because she posessed the horse-fucking rock CD.  Only as they
were leaving did the wife, now widow, mention that her upstairs neighbor had
uttered a blood-curdling scream prior to the horse falling through the
floor.

[DARING, IMFURIATING, OFFENSIVE, BUT ULTIMATELY A TOUR DE FORCE - Michiko
Kakutani, New York Times Book Review]


The police broke down Michelle's door and got confused because every wall
and door was either painted black or a mirror (the arrested wife realized
she'd have to redecorate when she got out of police custody; clearly they
were behind again), but they finally found the bedroom (over the other
couple's dining room) where the beautiful blonde woman lay, betyween life
and death, fighting for each breath.  "See, said the widow.  She's the one
who was abusing the horse."  The cops were not impressed.  The word of a
beautiful blonde woman always counts more than a frumpish woman, and the
widow was a tad frumpish although they had all gotten a little hot and
bothered when they found her wth her pants down (literally) attempting to
abuse Fred.  The cops called the paramedics, wondering how they'd get
Michelle out with the big horse shaped hole in the floor.

[WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO? NAUSEATING, SCHOOLBOY HUMOR AT BEST, DON'T
WASTE YOUR MONEY!  -- Wall Street Journal

One cop said: "watch the hole!" which was a bad thing to say because another
cop proceeded to fall in the hole immediately after that, but he grabbed the
chandelier in time and landed on Fred, who appeared to respond to him in a
manner wich is usuallly reserved for mares.  The rearing made him fall off,
but now he was disgusted. He had just found out the the horse was a homo,
and Fred was usuallly his mount in the Park Police and he wans't going to
work with a homo horse.  Homo cops were bad enough.  You were supposed to
pretend they were normal and refrain from imagining the vile and disgusting
thinsg they did in bed.  But with a horse, everything just hangs out.

[AN OPFFENSE TO OUR MOST DEARLY HELD VALUES. UPSETTING. THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE
INSTITUTIONALIZED -- Horse Fancier Magazine

The cop felt he had no choice but to resign from the police department, even
though it was a year befroe he would begin to get the best pension package.
He said he was a victim of constant, repeated sexual innuendo, fondling,
frottage, and indecent public displays of misplaced affection by his horse,
He had tried at first to sue the horse, but they said the horse had no
standing as a litigant,  So he sued the NYC Park Police for 20 million
dollars because now he could not perform with a woman; he heard neighing
when he tried.

[PRAY FOR THIS MAN, FOR HE IS GONG TO HELL BUT FOR GOD'S MERCY ON ALL
SINNERS WHO TRULY REPENT AND FOR WHOM DIVINE UINTERCESSIONS HAVE BEEN
MADE -- St. Joan-sur-lac Parish Gazette]

You will have to read te book to find out the outcome and to learn of
Michelle's miraculous personality change in her last days, the
transformation that caused her to donate all her money and raise many times
more for child welfare organizations that fight sexual abuse.  We can only
gove you a little teaser by saying that it happened as a result of the lurid
revelations which she would learn as she underwent memory retrieval therapy
and involved satanic ritual abuse my the entire Barnum and Bailey Circus,
which would kidnap her yearly when it went throught her town.  At secret
shows for the local men in power, Michelle would demonstare sex withe
elephants.  She was very disappointed five years leter, at age 18, when she
first did it with a man and reportedly made a rude remark saying she had
screwed bobcats with better dongs than his...  Their marriage was not a
success and she was divorced within the year.

Jennie, poster to Horse-Fucking Rock fan web sote bulletin board]

Michelle was buried in St. Joan's church in Quebec, Canada, where she comes
from, outside the boundaries of the sacred ground, because the priest just
couldn't bear to to bury her on hallowed ground after the CD migrated as far
north as St. Joan-sur lac.  He did say a funeral mass, but it was for all
the "sinners" who died on that particular day, as again, it was clear she
wouldn't even make it to purgatory.  However, he was a kindly man and did
not insist on these matters when sharing a cognac and a cigar with M.
Messier, and he shared reminiscences of "poor Michelle" from the times
before she left St. Joan-sur-lac  Unfortunately, every time he tried to call
up a picture of that child, he would see he in the company of a horse, no
matter how much he tried to see her in other contexts.  With great effort,
he could call her up with a large sheep dog, but that was worse as it had
been their family dog and he was sure that, given the cause of her demise,
they would not want to hear about her extraordinary love of animals.  From
her earliest youth, she had wanted to be either a farmer or a mergers and
acqusitions expert, and she had achieved her life's goal, he would remind
the grieving parents.

More personal and local than the epic sprawl of his recent Poems From
Naltsus Bichidin, Carl Thayler's Shake Hands goes after readers with a
frequently agonized, always lively honesty. Barrooms, love affairs,
roadside ephemera, bankrupt religion, a western sky under which
recognizing one's inevitable loneliness becomes the only possible way to
reach out to others; all these things swarm up at readers like barely
comprehensible dangers lurching into one's headlights on an all night
drive to nowhere in particular. One feels in these poems both Thayler's
fear of writing them and his need to do so. These are not the comments
of a smug cultural observer. Instead, Shake Hands reads like the knotted
midnight confessions of the writer for whom only poems can manage to say
what would otherwise never get said.

less remote from spurious fabulations
      might reign over
 regions of a gregarious
       environmentalism.  Acknowledge
  the danger these days of
        publicly appearing in furry flanks.

Which brings us, if not to spiders,
to the spidery morphology of plants
at whose glandular centers radiate
clustered forms finespun
from fire, presaging
flowers brimming with obdurate
leaves and petals of
a serviceable industrial green.

Surely, as relics
of fire we are sufficient
unto these fastnesses.
Small wonder during the week
      the women get perms
 before going to South Bend
       to watch the football game
  & shout like crazy.

------------------------------------


Carl Thayler has been one of the hidden masters of American poetry for
nearly forty years. His language is as sharp as a skinner's knife, and
reveals exactly what's beneath the skin — far more complex and
beautiful than any micro-chip orchestra or the unblinking innards of a
Rolex. We get one world per customer. Here's Carl's — cognoscenti will
recognize J. Dean, D. Varsi of Peyton Place, the cream of country
singers and fast drivers, old poets, good women, and gnarly codgers
encountered between now and LA fifty years ago.  --Howard McCord


Fierce and unflinching, Carl Thayler makes poems that are vulnerable
nonetheless in their feeling search for truth. That there be an
achieved  knowledge of truth in an unredeemed world—as the poet calls
it—is remarkable enough, but the music lifts also with sudden strikes of
ecstatic clarity. Like Hank Williams or Lefty Frizzell, he follows the
unpredictable and at times predacious wanderings of the heart. The
result—a lyric dignity very hard to locate these days of shallow,
post-modern irony-love.
--Dale Smith

With thanks to Jerrold Shiroma, I've just updated the Kenning website to =
include three mp3 samples from the audio edition of Kenning, the 12th =
issue.  Available are recordings of / by Sawako Nakayasu, Andrew Levy & =
Gerry Hemingway, and Purkinge.  I think the new design is more =
informative and easier to navigate.  Ordering options are simpler to =
follow as well.  If you haven't yet, the "index and samples" page is =
worth visiting, as it contains a fair range of work from (mostly) =
out-of-print back-issues.  See www.durationpress.com/kenning

Subject:      death of the poet Ece Ayhan
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Ece Ayhan, one of the giants of Turkish poetry, died last Friday.
A collection of his work was published by Sun and Moon Press as "A Blind Cat
Black and Orthodoxies" in 1997.
Here is two of his poems:


            Miss Kinar's Waters

She cried the smile of pebble stones with the raki from the carafe
from Miss Kinar now who became water to steep wells
with her straight hair what can she do in the theatre houses of
Shehzadehbashi
she could not have enough hats

This bald Hassan, this baldie swept the darkness
his rebellious cigarette lit backwards to avoid any laughter
and a police enters fairy tales which go on ever since
parting the human eyelashes of children

And gathered inside her the sadness of the hands of an oud
playing woman, appeared suddenly into wells in the evenings crying
from Miss Kinar's waters.

trans. by Murat Nemet-Nejat


            To Trace from Hebrew

My legs are long
they are long wherever I go
wherever I go they find me
my sister in a blind alley

To trace a dove for this town
to trace the eyes of the dove
one dove
in the middle ages one dove with chalk

Along the whole wall trees cool
I am tracing a sound
I want everybody everybody to have a sound
in the dove a sound in the middle ages in my sister a sound

Wherever I go they are long
they find me from my legs always
as I trace a different voice
and a holiday full of flags in a city
in Hebrew

<<My (original) point was not that culture and religion are necessarily
traceable to any such discrete activities as farming and (re)reading. The
fun, for me, is just that it would be hard to prove that they are *not* so
traceable, at least off the top of one's head. >>

Yes! absolutely right. There&#8217;s no way to prove it. And that's great, I think. (Who would be serious when they can be serial and se real?) But it's true: The more you wonder and study the less you prove. And what other place is there but<OFF the top of my head>? My last mailing <re:culture, religion, poetics, crit,close> did try to off hand bring together some of the strands of last week&#8217;s poetics discussions that I&#8217;d followed on this list: from armantrout to corn fields, red wheelbarrow to food guilt, finance and force, aggressive defences of the unaccountable ...

Your Sapfic image sounds fine to me: hanging round in robe and slippers, steaming oolong tea and poppy seed too, maybe. Here the cherries are fat and it smells of meadowsweet and rainsteam. Some like the soft and comfy, some the sexed and sharp slipper, some to slip with sludge between the country toes as images. What interests, or even bothers me in these discussions, is the field of <self-satisfaction>. Whether you hang around or work hard, earn your bread or have it handed to you on a plate, peasant or priestly, culturing or relazing: it&#8217;s always coming from somewhere else. No one can feel justified that they themselves, autopoietically as it were, have achieved anything. Talented, gifted, energetic or fortunate &#8211; none of this is <virtuous> in any other sense than (the radical) <em-powered>. That&#8217;s why I like pagan images and imaginary notions like the muses, or even blessing bodhisattvas if you like. I am not aware that anything can be said to exist. Ex!
 cept categorically, of course! The belated <author>. We are all on charity, agape at the gods, say, non-plussed half of the time, even if we&#8217;re grateful.

It would be nice if Lawrence Upton could provide this list with some examples of <substantiated> assertions, since it has been asserted that certain of them are not only unsubstantiated, but even indicative of undetermined personal perversions. (That&#8217;s what the phrase ad hominem stands for.) Substantiated proofs are mythical emanations if ever there was one. I dunno why one needs to be so coy about writing on Lissa Wolsak, for example. Why not say something off the cuff at least? (Attempted explanation &#8211; exploration, eruption? &#8211; is also an acceptable buzz.)

What about  also someone offering us a disquisition on the differential >orgasmic/ orgiastic< too: going fom the auto-erotic to the poetic, the <urge> to the <works>, the privates to the public interfaces?

It puzzles me that the concept of <critical> should be practically limited to the pejorative twist. Why should it be only <put down> and not open up? We are obviously talking <crisis> here. Good. Culture is literally criticism. It is an open sore and a wound up scar. Stigma and cicatrice. Like the possible pun on <occult>, seedy salt in the cellar, voodoo in my basement, nightshade growth: it is the hidden being displayed, a cut wound covered up by writing. The legible is a <pick me up> line. (I went on all about such radical grafting and graft in my last mail...)

There is a suggestion of a sort of sacred, holistic, unquestionable oneness in a piece of poetry,say. A work that works. A cybernetics of creativity where there is nothing you can say that doesn&#8217;t fit anyway comfortably within the <saystem>. That is Chaos as oppressive language, order-nary business as usual. BUT. As soon as you act at all, it&#8217;s critical. There is no plain-stream, but banks, obstacles, flotsam. No flow without friction.  That&#8217;s the point of our concept poetic. Listening not just hearing, <speak out>, maybe, rather than chat. (I think that once you&#8217;ve written a poem, no innocent uninfected prose is ever possible again. Maybe poets could generally try the exercise of desperately not writing poetry, and see what comes out of their talk by accident. What offers itself as not <secondary>.) A poem in its pathetic assertive insistence on individual autonomy from the rest of anyway noise.

Love,
Ruskin

P.S. Maybe a minifesto clause diametrically opposed to one suggested last week (along the lines of: a good piece of writing is one that makes me write another one). What about: A good piece of writing is one that doesn't make me feel bad that I haven't written anything.
i don't know if that's a serious proposition. What would be the ramifications?

Here are some details of a new annual print magazine I edit.
If you like the sound of it, drop me a line and I can send some excerpts.
If you like them, tell me about it, ask for a copy in the flesh. If you don&#8217;t, tell me too.
You can see the List of Contents below.

The next issue, no. 2, is due at the end of 2002, as a yearbook of sorts,

Maybe there&#8217;ll be a website by then.
If you will have liked any of the stuff in issue one, feel free to contribute something.
The tone and taste may change, the question&#8216;ll still be something like <in/re- novation?>

Cheers,
Ruskin

This first issue includes material by Axel S. Parrot, Bysshe Berkeley and R.Eustace Dart, all discussing a sonnet and particular fragments by the German writing poet Theo Reiz de Man. The essays and emerging poems convoke and diverge on themes of love and consum-mating; of translation, rhetoric and metric; of poetry as everyday allegory, both theo-logical and trade-itional &#8211; both goods and page-white godd- as &#8216;sonnet sweet/ fettered&#8216; (Keats); of meaning in the mind or sense in astrognomic constellations &#8211; &#8216;starlight/ that speaks familiar language&#8216; (Baudelaire); of grammatical- & musicality; of violence and atonement, beauty, grace and grace.

> An Arab Poet Who Dares to Differ
>
> July 13, 2002
> By ADAM SHATZ
>
>
>
>
>
>
> BERLIN - "If I had to choose one word to describe myself,
> it would be peasant," the poet known as Adonis said
> recently in his cozy office at the Institute for Advanced
> Studies here.
>
> It is an uncharacteristic note of humility, coming from a
> man who renamed himself after the Greek fertility god and
> who is widely considered the Arab world's greatest living
> poet. Adonis (pronounced AH-doh-nees) was born Ali Ahmad
> Said to farmers who raised him in a Syrian village without
> electricity. But the only patch of land this urbane,
> irreverent man has cultivated is the garden of language.
>
> Wearing a tweed jacket and a button-down blue shirt,
> Adonis, 72, has a wild shock of hair, a grizzled face,
> clever eyes that always seem to be reaching for their
> target, and the light step of someone who has been on the
> move for nearly a half century. Small and excitable, he can
> shift in a moment from literary theory to literary gossip.
>
> Some Arab poets are more popular than Adonis - Mahmoud
> Darwish, the Palestinian poet, for instance - but none are
> more admired. A pioneer of the prose poem, he has played a
> role in Arab modernism comparable to T. S. Eliot's in
> English-language poetry. The literary and cultural critic
> Edward Said calls him "today's most daring and provocative
> Arab poet." The poet Samuel Hazo, who translated Adonis's
> collection "The Pages of Day and Night," said, "There is
> Arabic poetry before Adonis, and there is Arabic poetry
> after Adonis."
>
> Experimental in style and prophetic in tone, Adonis's
> poetry combines the formal innovations of modernism with
> the mystical imagery of classical Arabic poetry. He has
> evoked the anguish of exile, the spiritual desolation of
> the Arab world, the intoxicating experiences of madness and
> erotic bliss, the existential dance of self and the other.
> But what defines his work, above all, is the force of
> creative destruction, which burns through everything he
> writes. "We will die if we do not create gods/We will die
> if we do not kill them," he once wrote, echoing his
> favorite poet, Nietzsche.
>
> Poetry, he said, is "a question that begets another
> question" - a deeply subversive stance in a region in which
> poets are often expected to take stands and provide
> answers. Why is there so much didactic poetry in Arabic?
> Speaking in French, Adonis gets straight to the point:
> "It's a tradition, beginning with Islam, which introduced
> the ideological use of poetry to the world long before
> Communism. There's a line that runs from Islam to the
> caliphs to the parties of right and left." Thanks to the
> difficulty of his work, and his often vehement critiques of
> Arab society, Adonis is more respected than loved by Arab
> readers.
>
> Adonis, for his part, appears to relish his contrarian
> reputation, sneering at "the public" as "an ideological
> notion" and trying to please it "a sign of decadence for a
> true work of art." Asked about the Egyptian novelist Naguib
> Mahfouz, who is said to have been chosen over him for the
> Nobel Prize in 1988, he said, "Mahfouz is more of a symbol
> than a great writer."
>
> As for his rival Arab poets, they are "continuing the
> tradition with a few variations, whereas I am the rupture
> with the past, I am the one who is revolutionizing the
> order of things, and that is ultimately what matters."
>
> Adonis, who lives in Paris, is spending the year in Berlin,
> where he hopes to finish the fourth volume of "Al-Kitab"
> ("The Book"), a Dantesque journey into what he calls "the
> inferno of Arab history," beginning with the death of the
> Prophet Muhammad and concluding with the fall of Baghdad to
> the Mongols in 1258. As a member of the Alawites, a Shiite
> minority in Syria, Adonis has always had an acute sense of
> being an outsider, and "Al-Kitab" offers a radically
> heretical view of Arab history, as seen by its many
> dissidents.
>
> "I am among those who seek the ills of the Arabs in their
> own history, not outside of it," he said. An outspoken
> champion of secular democracy and a ferocious critic of
> organized religion, Adonis has published many studies of
> Arab culture and history, notably the book "The Changing
> and the Fixed: A Study of Conformity and Originality in
> Arab Culture." In that volume, banned in certain Arab
> countries as heresy, Adonis accused Islam's clerics of
> perpetuating what he calls past-ism - a stubborn tendency
> to cling to what is known and to fear the new. According to
> Adonis, even apparently secular forms of politics in the
> Arab world, notably Arab nationalism and Marxism, are
> religious in structure, presenting themselves as
> revelations - absolute truths that confirm received wisdom
> instead of fostering debate.
>
> "We live in a culture that doesn't leave a space for
> questions," he said, puffing on a cigarillo. "It knows all
> the answers in advance. Even God has nothing left to say!"
> He let out a high-pitched giggle, as he often does after
> saying something particularly ominous or apocalyptic. What
> the Arab world needs, more than anything, he said, is a
> "revolution of subjectivity" that would emancipate people
> from tradition. Until this inner revolution occurs, he
> warned, Arabs would know only a secondhand modernity, a
> dangerous brew of hollow consumerism, rigged elections and
> radical Islam. "There is no more culture in the Arab
> world," he said. "It's finished. Culturally speaking, we
> are a part of Western culture, but only as consumers, not
> as creators."
>
> To American readers of Fouad Ajami and V. S. Naipaul,
> Adonis's criticisms of Arab society may have a familiar
> ring. But what sets him apart from these men is that he
> writes in Arabic for an Arab audience, and that he is
> equally critical of the West, particularly the United
> States. "What strikes me about the States," he said,
> widening his arms as if he were conducting the Berlin
> Philharmonic, "is the richness of American society on the
> one hand and, on the other" - he brought his hands together
> as if he were measuring a grain of sand - "the smallness of
> its foreign policy."
>
> Since Sept. 11, some readers have turned to Adonis's
> chilling 1971 poem, "The Funeral of New York," a vision of
> the city in flames that has a strong claim to being "The
> Waste Land" of our time. In the poem, a nameless narrator
> wanders through the Financial District and Harlem, looking
> in vain for Walt Whitman's ghost and angrily imagining "an
> eastern wind" uprooting skyscrapers, "a cloud necklaced
> with fire" and "people melting like tears."
>
> "New York, to me, is both heaven and hell," he explained,
> adding, "When I read this poem today, it frightens me."
>
> The eldest of six children, Adonis was born in 1930 in
> Qassabin, on the coast near Latakia. Although his father
> could not afford to send him to school, he taught his son
> to read poetry and the Koran. According to a well-known
> story, when Shukri al-Kuwatli, the first president of the
> newly independent republic, visited nearby Jableh, the
> 14-year-old Adonis insisted on reading a poem he had
> written for the occasion. The president was dazzled by the
> boy's gifts. "Tell me, what do you want?" he asked him. "I
> want to go to school," Adonis replied.
>
> Within a week, the president had arranged for Adonis to
> attend a French-run high school. From there he went on to
> the University of Damascus, where he studied German
> philosophy and discovered Rimbaud and Baudelaire. At 19 he
> changed his name to Adonis because he couldn't get poems
> published under his own name. "I am a pagan prophet," he
> often says, a self-description that, like his name, is the
> subject of many jokes among his Arab peers.
>
> In 1956, after spending a year in prison for antigovernment
> activities, Adonis fled to Beirut, then a vibrant,
> cosmopolitan haven for Arab poets, exiles and rebels. With
> his friend Yusuf al-Khal, a Lebanese poet, he edited the
> seminal journal Shir (Poetry), a forum for experimental
> Arabic poetry as well as European verse in translation.
>
> "All the poetry in the Arab world in this period was either
> traditionalist or nationalist," Adonis recalled. "What we
> were trying to achieve was a rediscovery of the self,
> against the tribe, against the umma, against all these
> ideological forms of culture. And though we were often
> boycotted and accused of Americanism and other sins,
> everyone acknowledges today that all that is true and real
> in Arab poetry comes from Shir."
>
> In 1968, Adonis created another influential journal,
> Mawaqif (Positions), which enlarged the focus of Shir by
> addressing the politics - and the illusions - of Arab
> nations after their defeat by Israel in 1967. When the
> Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt was at his
> apogee, Mawaqif devoted a special issue to skewering the
> ideology of pan-Arabism. The next issue took on an even
> more sacred cow, the Palestinian movement. "Our project was
> to put into question an entire culture and history, not
> just poetry," he said, "in order to renew Arab thought."
>
> Adonis said he would have been happy to stay in Beirut, but
> the civil war there made that impossible. During the 1982
> Israeli invasion of Lebanon, his bedroom was bombed while
> he sat with his wife, Khalida, in the living room. A year
> later he settled in Paris, choosing, as he puts it, the
> "hell of exile" over "the hell of daily life" in the Arab
> countries. Hell may seem a strong word to describe the life
> of a middle-class literature professor at the Collège de
> France, but the earthly comforts of life in exile, he said,
> come with a painful sense of solitude, as well as the
> ever-present menace of the fatwas issued against him.
>
> "We are all seen as renegades and anti-Muslims, and we're
> all on hit lists," he said, referring to secular Arab
> intellectuals. Meanwhile, he said, fundamentalism is
> nourished by the Israeli military campaign in the West
> Bank. "We are caught," he said, "between fundamentalism and
> the silence of our Jewish intellectual friends."
>
> "The Palestinian problem," he continued, lowering his voice
> for emphasis, "goes beyond politics. It is an ethical
> problem, and ethics is never on the side of power. Jews and
> Palestinians must live together, whether it's in two states
> or in a federation." He paused, sipping from a glass of red
> wine. "Religion has ceased to be a culture and become a
> mythology, for Islam as well as Judaism. These are people
> who do not recognize, or reflect the other, in their
> language, people completely closed in on themselves.
> Everyone pretends that God told them his last words." He
> laughed heartily, but he did not look happy.

1. Why the sudden change after Net14 ?
2. The alphabet series ends at u .
3. Only five named files: I realized these were already breaking with some
sort of order - I had to return to a more coherent system.
4. With the dyadic formations, things become confused:
a. Why start with ah, am, an? Where is ai, aj?
b. With the doubles, where is aa? Why does this suddenly break off at jj -
only to start with another series, that of k, after jy?
c. Why does k complete the dyadic series k*, and l complete l*?
d. Where is m* headed?
e. Do kk, ll, and mm replace earlier files related to the doubles series?
Have texts inadvertently been lost?

I am currently revising my home-page, emphasizing newer work and this
series - I have no answer whatsoever. My texts tend towards their own
vagaries and wayward classifications - often beginning as if the whole
world is ordered, ending, as if everything is in dissolution. In a
state of depression, both ends transform into substance, through which
may be read a certain decathected truth; often, however, I write in a
state of exhilaration...

Moral Relativity Is a Hot Topic? True. Absolutely.-->

The Sept. 11 attacks have led to criticism of postmodernists, now
defending their views.

Postmodernism challenges the notion of objective truth and rejects the
possibility of a transcendent ethical perspective. Surely [Sept. 11]

Are you now or have you ever been a postmodernist?

This new version of "America, love it or leave it!" is directed at a few
professors of literature, history, and sociology who are being told that
they are directly responsible for the weakening of the nation's moral
fiber and
indirectly responsible for the attack a weakened nation has suffered.

Other people have mentioned it, but it bears repeating:

Tom Orange's Clark Coolidge site at EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/coolidge/) is a phenomenal labor of love.
Don't miss the early poems.

Bravo, Tom!

And C.C. too, of course.

Since he didn't mention it himself, I thought I'd say that Patrick Durgin has
done a very nice job of updating my EPC author page. He's added new poems and
links, including the much discussed Boston Review piece. Thank you, Patrick.

Actually good reminder for all this time of year:

So, let me jump in and save Christopher Alexander the trouble:


send email to

listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu

message should simply be

set poetics nomail

**
then later:

set poetics mail

note you can always read the list on the archive at

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html

some messages read better in "proportional space" (typically needed if the
prose line doesn't break at the right end of the screen but strands out
horizontally till the end of the paragraph), others read better in
"nonproportional space" (typically linebreaks for poems are run-in, as are
line ends for cited passages from previous emails). you can toggle
proportional/nonproportional at the top of the archive screen.

US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies
By Ritt Goldstein
July 15 2002

The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens
as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.

The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will
have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany
through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum
of 4 per cent of Americans to report "suspicious activity".

Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier
this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale
investigations of US citizens.

As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war
against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.

Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are
being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to
homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees,
truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted
recruits.

A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov,
is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants
participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the
10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total
population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.

"Keep a low profile and avoid loud conversations or
arguments."

I think this is marvelous news!  People don't pay
enough attention to each other, in general, but with
all that spying going on, well, that's a fine remedy
to self-centeredness!

I predict that avant-garde poets will be put to
special use in ~encryption.~  Imagine all the secret
spy messages that can be transmitted under the guise
of "experimental" poetry.  And who better to crack
codes than we who've been finding meaning in
gobbledygook for years.

As far as "reporting suspicious activity," my favorite
was when that call was put out this past October 31st,
for Halloween.  "Hello?  Is this the police station?
I just wanted to report: some very small people
wearing masks with pimply hag noses are going round
the neighborhood being given suspicious wrapped candy
bar-sized packages, which they carry off in bags."

List members should be especially comfortable in such
an environment, having had all our postings
pre-screened by a moderator for so long.

. . . Think of it as a kind of ~fame,~ being spied
upon.  After all, isn't that what celebrity is all
about: people photographing you, Boswells recording
your every movement . . .

Actually, there's an Eliot Weinberger essay more or less about this. Maybe
in Works on Paper or Outside Stories?

Remember, Whittaker Chambers, who fingered Alger Hiss as a communist, had
been a poet included in at least one objectivist-related anthology.

When he was 18 or so, Whittaker Chambers translatated Bambi from Felix
Salten's original German. For a long time it was *the* translation of Bambi
-- at leat, it was the one I kept running across. I'm pretty sure it's the
one Disney used ...

Years ago, reading Alger Hiss' Recollections of a Life, I got the idea to do
a super-paranoid experimental poet-version of Hiss' life, including an
equally super-paranoid, Mac Lowian write-through of Chambers' translation of
Bambi. Earl Sighs (an anagram of Hiss) was the name I gave the author; it
was called Das Bambi's and opened with an epigraph from a late friend of
mine, Daniel Davidson: "You have no idea the level of paranoia that exists
in this community."

Maybe it's time to drag that project out of the file cabinet & dust it off
...

I find difficulty in accepting this argument.

The representation that I am convinced has garnered interest.

After poetry, ideas cannot be useful.

A little moment that crystallizes "a critical thought" took place in a
school.

What is this will that takes place in the school?

A number, the great one of the development of the exhibitions of the
producers.

Publish each interest for the other.

The damage of this process is an indicated name, the rum a silly man drank.

I have to consider this note always because I think that sensitivity blocked
something.

It is confused to begin with.

The numerous effort to prevent the completely closed exclusion.

Several of these producers write.

This result has much to form with the intellectual climate of the treated
poetry of systems.

Enter the screen for these poets.

The hour is present in a new second that tests poetics.

I contained only the information and the test and the information with
periodic material.

Poetics of the zone names only some important efforts.

The broken academy orders the anthology of egg yolk and the literary report
of the straits.

Translate a poet for the group.

A safe disorder will be evident.

You can probably do poetics for the institute of the premise theoreticians.

I hold a basket case rife with conclusions.

They suggest, leave the word.

works
reside at JOGLARS Crossmedia Broadcast (http://cla.umn.edu/joglars).
Recent work has focused on activating online collaborative workspaces

real time environment. Since 1991, he has made his home at Dreamtime
Village
(http://www.dreamtimevillage.org), a hypermedia / permaculture village
project, located in the driftless bioregion of southwestern Wisconsin.
aND devotes much time to creating edible wilderness indoors & out,
growing
such things as figs, citrus, cherries, grapes & chestnuts. 1998 marked

Gary, these suthor photo one-liners are right on. inspiring me to write my
own: "I have washed my face and combed my hair to have my pic taken. I am
smiling for the camera. I look entirely respectable. Their bodies are hidden
in shallow graves. "
            I loved yr note abt my eork, in SPD catalog. Youre the first to
ideintify my poetry as always trying to escape its previous identity. I hope
you might expand on that insight somewhat for JACKET.
                Pllease give my best wishes to Nada, and accept the same for
yourself. BTW, do you know Lissa Wolsak's poetry? I love it.     David

 This is just to say.
  ACTION REPLAY post script. A modest publication to follow a series of
exhibitions re-visiting
 NZ art of the 1970s--performance, video, installation, all that good stuff
has just appeared.

  I was a co-curator of the exhibition and wrote one of the two essays
(there are also images from the show). It is a memoir of sorts in which I
ravel and unravel the weave of art writing, poetry, and
'post object' art as we called it, that the times seemed to demand.

  It is available from artsspace@artspace.org.nz. Price $10

Alan M. Brunton
Christchurch 14 October 1946 - Amsterdam 27 June 2002
beating on the door of the next world / like a hammer on a stone

 The sudden death of Alan Brunton is a great blow.=20
  I  am posting obituaries from The New Zealand Herald (Auckland) and
TheEvening Post and The Dominion, Wellington. =20
=20
06.07.2002
By PETER CALDER=20
* Poet, scriptwriter, performer. Died aged 55.=20
One evening in early 1970, Alan Brunton was sharing a stage with some =
of the
elder statesmen of New Zealand poetry. Kendrick Smithyman was there and
Keith Sinclair, and Karl Stead too as I recall.=20
When his turn came, the youngest reader, plainly unintimidated by the
company he was keeping, strode to the edge of the platform and dropped =
the
needle on a scratchy LP. The insistent guitar riff of Led Zeppelin's =
Whole
Lotta Love filled the hall.=20
"I just thought," he drawled raffishly after the entire song had =
played,
"you'd like to hear some poetry before I started reading."=20
The stunt seems slightly gauche now, suspicious as we are of exuberance =
and
grand gesture. But for Brunton, who died suddenly in Amsterdam last =
week,
exuberance was a native language.=20
As poet and performer, he was always breaking boundaries and inciting =
those
who worked with him to do the same.=20
In July 1969 (coinciding, to his endless delight, with the first moon =
walk),
he founded the poetry magazine Freed, which took its name from his =
manifesto
that the word is freed from the traditions that stifle creativity.=20
In the quarter century that followed, he published 12 volumes of poetry
(latterly under his own imprint, Bumper Books) and co-edited an =
anthology of
New Zealand poems from those early decades.=20
He was writer in residence at Canterbury University in 1998. But more
visibly, he co-founded with partner Sally Rodwell the enduring, =
anarchic and
inventive experimental theatre troupe Red Mole, which cut a wild yet =
elegant
dash across the cultural life of the nation.=20
Like many of our artists, he was more honoured abroad than at home. He =
wrote
pointedly in a recent biographical note that he had appeared at
international festivals in Colombia, Denmark and Norway but not yet in =
his
own country. Yet in its bases in New York, New Mexico and Amsterdam =
from
1978 to 1988, Red Mole was legendary.=20
Brunton and Rodwell returned to Wellington in late 1988 and Red Mole
prospered, staging performances and workshops and sponsoring tours by
international performers.=20
He had just begun a new tour with a show called Grooves of Glory when =
he
died. He is survived by Rodwell and a daughter, Ruby.=20

arts
festival and numerous buskers have made Wellington a touch blas=E9 =
about shows
that throw theatre, music, dance, poetry, outlandish costumes and
circus-style tricks into the mix. But go back nearly 30 years and =
Wellington
audiences didn't know what had hit them with the Red Mole experimental
theatre group. Alan Brunton, founder with his wife Sally Rodwell, took =
on a
wide variety of artists along the way, including poet Ian Wedde, =
musician
Jan Preston, actor Cathy Downes and musician Midge Marsden. They =
ignored the
usual stuffy boundaries between the performing arts - and equally =
stuffy
venues - and turned theatre, cabaret, music and dance upside down. =
Brunton's
talent and influence as a pioneer performance artist - and mentor - was
considerable. Red Mole shows were known for their openness, frenetic =
energy
and - a Brunton trademark - large dollops of humour. The first show =
Whimsy
And The Seven Spectacles - to Stravinsky's March Of The Elephants - was =
held
at Victoria University's student union in November 1974. Wellington =
Town
Hall and theatre venues were later used, but Red Mole staged shows in =
the
last places people ever expected to see avant garde theatre - James =
Smith's
store, parks, nightclubs, rock concerts, and, in the summer, country =
halls
and motor camps. A Wellington venue which fitted Red Mole's =
iconoclastic
bent - and one of it's biggest shows - was a late night stint in 1977 =
at
Carmen's transvestite strip club, The Balcony, on the corner of =
Victoria and
Harris streets. The line up for Red Mole's Golden Hits was a Who's Who =
of
Kiwi talent, including Marsden, singer Beaver, Wayne Mason, Barry =
Saunders,
Andy Anderson, Mary Jane O'Reilly, Rick Bryant - and Carmen. "It was =
partly
a sleazy audience if you like, but it also turned into an audience for =
their
work," Wedde recalls. "People would go there not just to watch the =
trannies
strip, but also to watch the show." Red Mole had already touched a =
wider
audience the same year, opening shows for Split Enz. They later were in
line-ups with Th' Dudes, Citizen Band and The Suburban Reptiles. In =
1978 Sam
Neill directed a 50-minute documentary film On The Road With Red Mole.
Brunton's inspiration to write started early. At 14 he read Colin =
Wilson's
The Outsider, which detailed the likes of Van Gogh and Nijinsky. "At =
the
same time (at school), I'm being thrashed by sadistic wretches, beaten =
with
rattan canes . . . This is what's going on as I discover I want to =
write,"
he said last year. But other teachers, who were Czech refuges, taught =
him
Rilke and he read Shelley and Blake. Brunton contributed poems to =
student
magazines from 1968 while completing a masters degree in English at
Victoria. In 1969 he helped found Freed magazine - editing the first =
two
issues of experimental poetry and writing. The same year at an avant =
garde
cabaret in Auckland he hammered bits of wood together to make the word =
poem.
Brunton spent three years in Europe and Asia from 1970, and had his =
first
book Messengers In Blackface published. When he founded Red Mole in =
1974
Brunton would sketch out a scenario and let the actors fill it. It was =
some
time until he was confident to write complete scripts. He ended up =
writing
and performing about 45. For 10 years from 1978 Red Mole were based in =
the
United States and Europe. In New York their base was the Lower East =
Side at
Avenue C and Ninth St - in the 1980s a rough Puerto Rican =
neighbourhood.
They performed on the streets, with New York-based Kiwi band The =
Drongos, at
a theatre in the then-sleazy Times Square and Riker's Island prison.
Washington DC dates included a children's theatre and Thanksgiving Day =
at
the New Zealand Embassy. Brunton, Rodwell and daughter Ruby - born =
while in
New Mexico - returned to Wellington in 1988. He continued to perform =
under
Red Mole and other guises here and overseas, and to write, edit and
collaborate with other artists. He founded publishing company Bumper =
Books
to produce some of his and other writers' works. He was Canterbury
University's writer in residence in 1998. He helped found the Save =
Erskine
College Trust to protect the historic building near his Island Bay =
home,
directed short films, recorded albums, and support young Wellington
musicians and performers, particularly The Space venue in Newtown. Much =
of
their work has been inspired or influenced by Red Mole.  Brunton died =
after
suffering heart attack in Amsterdam - one of his favourite cities. He =
was
touring the Red Mole show Grooves Of Glory with Rodwell and young The =
Space
musician Jeff Henderson. The show had already been well-received in =
Oslo.
Red Mole were due to perform in Warsaw and New York. * Sources: Post

The unique theatrical voice of Alan Brunton was stilled last week.
 Timothy O'Brien gives his appreciation of Brunton's artistic legacy.=20
Alan Brunton was the possessor of a unique voice whom the arts in which =
he
excelled will sorely miss.
Yet the sad fact is that, till his untimely death at the age of 55 in
Amsterdam last week, his contribution as poet, publisher, director and =
actor
had been overlooked in New Zealand recently.
Where 20 years ago the theatre group Red Mole had been almost a =
household
name, playing widely throughout the country, latterly mere handfuls =
made it
to The Space in Newtown for their last show Grooves of Glory.
Yet when I made that journey myself, it was to rediscover of a group =
whose
signature was still unmistakable but whose art had become more deep and
humane, more exhilarating in its economic theatricality, than one
remembered. In the writing and performance of that piece, one could see =
what
set Brunton apart.
Those were an unfashionable commitment to a high style, to words which
intoxicated, to allusion and intelligence. There was no element of the
desiccated and ironically detached observation
of trivialities which often passes for profundity.
Brunton's scripts brought the whole dictionary into play because the =
work
was about big things that mattered - love, the universe, everything.
The show proved that, if public neglect had been a high price to pay =
for an
uncompromising commitment to artistic vision, the prolific Brunton had =
not
wasted his time failing to create.
Along with Sally Rodwell, his partner - a weak and corporate word to
describe such a conspiracy of minds and bodies - he had continued to =
express
the Mole's radical theatrical vision in the practice of community =
theatre.
But their idea of that was far from the worthy dullness that the name
conjures - all who took part, whatever their talent, became part of a
magical encounter with theatre and ideas. It's this continuing =
engagement
with new players that will ensure Red Mole's ideas and Brunton's =
visionary
approach to poetry and theatre remain at large.
Brunton's death came after he and Rodwell had performed Grooves to =
acclaim
at a theatrical festival in Norway. Here are the last words of that =
show.
I leave to you my previously unreleased catalogue, the A and O
of my substance, my cowboy songs, the postcards
I never sent from the Hell I lived in without you,
little dancer da da da,
I leave to you these things, this
and this, this everything,
little dancer, as you go as you go
I return the bird you gave to me
little dancer,
I return the bowl with its few drops of the Great Juice I carried along =
your
Silk Road,
stopping at each fountain of mineral water for a miracle
I leave for you,
where I listened to the conversations at tables
in cafes when citizens regulated the Public Interest
and all their decisions I leave
to you little dancer, there you go there you go
the nomadic nights I searched for
`the herb Lunatica' I leave to you
little dancer
because that's how much I enjoyed your company
Life goes from A to B that's it
that's the secret . . . little dancer . . .

This is not a laughing matter. Thank you, Patrick Herron, for posting the below information. It
is barely believable that the USA is about to embark on such (another) massive mistake. But
indeed it is. Argentina here we come. bin Laden might get a chuckle out of this one, but
Americans should not. It is very bad news indeed. I strongly hope that Americans do not allow
their government to create a nation of informants. What a prospect.

Not that Canada, where I live, is far behind. Bill C 36
(http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&q=%22bill+c+36%22 ) is the 'anti-terrorism
legislation introduced here not long ago. "Bill C-36 does not represent an appropriate balance
between civil rights and national security. Bill C-36 is a threat to the fundamental rights and
freedoms of those living in Canada. Nor does it meet standards of fairness, openness and
accountability that are the hallmark of democratic government" (from
http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/c-36.html ).

US planning to recruit one in 24 Americans as citizen spies
By Ritt Goldstein
July 15 2002

The Bush Administration aims to recruit millions of United States citizens
as domestic informants in a program likely to alarm civil liberties groups.

The Terrorism Information and Prevention System, or TIPS, means the US will
have a higher percentage of citizen informants than the former East Germany
through the infamous Stasi secret police. The program would use a minimum
of 4 per cent of Americans to report "suspicious activity".

Civil liberties groups have already warned that, with the passage earlier
this year of the Patriot Act, there is potential for abusive, large-scale
investigations of US citizens.

As with the Patriot Act, TIPS is being pursued as part of the so-called war
against terrorism. It is a Department of Justice project.

Highlighting the scope of the surveillance network, TIPS volunteers are
being recruited primarily from among those whose work provides access to
homes, businesses or transport systems. Letter carriers, utility employees,
truck drivers and train conductors are among those named as targeted
recruits.

A pilot program, described on the government Web site www.citizencorps.gov,
is scheduled to start next month in 10 cities, with 1 million informants
participating in the first stage. Assuming the program is initiated in the
10 largest US cities, that will be 1 million informants for a total
population of almost 24 million, or one in 24 people.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

A long-overdue recognition of Robin Blaser's indispensable contribution to
20th-century poetry and poetics.

Editor Miriam Nichols has brought together an international gathering of
scholars and poets to investigate and celebrate the fifty-year career of
Robin Blaser, a poet who first emerged in the early 1950s as a key
figure--along with Jack Spicer and Robert Duncan--in the Berkeley
Renaissance and has since become a defining presence in the poetries of
both the U.S. and Canada.  Blaser's poetics of passionate
companionship--exemplified by the important new long poem on Dante included
in this volume--is examined from a broad range of historically- and
theoretically-informed perspectives. In addition to offering a synthetic
introduction to Blaser's oeuvre and a revelatory new interview with the
poet, Nichols has also assembled an illuminating section of archival
materials that includes extensive transcripts from Blaser's important
"Astonishments" lectures of the early 1970s and a previously unpublished
exchange (edited by Kevin Killian) on "Eastern Poetry and Western Poetry"
that took place between Blaser, Spicer, and Duncan in 1956. A delightful
set of rare photographs of Blaser rounds out a comprehensive volume that
makes an ideal companion to Blaser's _The Holy Forest_ (Coach House, 1993).

Self-Ex


A loudmouth and depressive to boot. A programming and hacking fraud
knowing less than a ten year old. Absolutely no reason to believe that
things are getting better. Always afraid of losing my friends. As if
quantity established meaning in the world. At the age of 59, I can't get a
decent university job. Avatars save nothing and hardly speak to me. Azure
brings light and a small comfort into my life. Azure has been so good for
me. Azure was enfolded in my arms. Believe I am a genius yet I don't know
what that means. Can't imagine what she finds in me. Carry books as a
security blanket. Constantly afraid of starving to death, being unable to
work. Constantly feel I let her down. Couldn't stop thinking about them.
Disordered of everything these memories. Don't deserve so much beauty.
Don't know how they can stand me. Don't want to have anything attributed
to the wrong person. Dreaming of iceflows, Inuit dreams. Ended up in the
hospital with a panic attack in Miami. Every day I face my own failure,
economically, artistically. Everything is flows and chance, randomness.
Everywhere I live seems like a holocaust that I bring with me. Fading and
evanescent avatars. Hard to accept that Azure loves me. Hold onto my work
as a drowning man. Hold onto small hopes of employment like someone
terminally ill. I'm writing this and sorting this to defend myself. If it
reaches a point when I can no longer function, I wish to be put to death.
It doesn't matter that I'm an excellent and inspiring teacher.  It's as if
my name meant something somewhere. Jealous of people who can take the day
off happily. Jealous of the money people have when I can't afford clothes.
Looking around the corner, Nikuko watching. Migraines are increasing. My
relations with other women have been terrible. My relatives tolerate me at
best. My sister is my father's favorite; my brother was my mother's. My
work will last millennia. My worry is that I produce quantity, not
quality. Nothing in my life beyond Azure, my friends, my daughter. Nothing
is attributed. Police circling the neighborhood again in the middle of the
night. Preparing to grade GREs and frightened out of my mind I won't pass.
She has to be faced with my failures, my depressions. She tolerates me and
loves me and I have no idea why. Since my mother died, my family relations
have been harsher. Sleeping is a horror show. Sociable, which is the final
grace. States of mind in deliberate dissolution. Stress is killing me.
Stupidly add up my search engine hits day after day. Terrified of losing
myself as hunger and homelessness seeps in. The other day I had to
suddenly stop typing and lie down. There's never enough in my world.
There's no end to it.  They protect me against the rest of the world. They
see no point in the work I do. They were dying. This is a sign of
depression as the world melds away into horror. Today I saw tiny turtles
for sale in the hot Chinatown sun. Too much television and not enough
instrument practice. Took Celexa and Valium, hoping for the sleep of the
dead. Turn the video camera and audio on us, stripping us naked. Violence
sits on one shoulder, pain on the other. Warning lights reflected on the
ceiling. Was very close to passing out. When I'm not writing, I'm ripping
myself apart. Worried about driving her away. Would die for her and am
trying to live for her. Writing every day is obsessive-compulsive, and
guarantees nothing. Writing now after trying once again to sleep.

This is hilarious.  I recently sent along my first "author" photo.  It was
of the "so lost in thought was I" variety.

Subject:      New Issues of AUGHT, no. 8 and no. 9 (2002), Are Available
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm very pleased to announce that two new issues of the on-line poetry
journal AUGHT are now available. The AUGHT web site is

http://people2.clarityconnect.com/webpages6/ronhenry/aught.htm

The first new issue, AUGHT no. 8, contains a stimulating variety of fine
innovative verse from 21 different poets both new and familiar to the pages
of the journal, including Sheila E. Murphy, Michael Farrell, Joel Chace,
and Ric Carfagna, among others. I think it's a particularly strong issue,
displaying a range of innovative approaches to the written line.

The second new issue, AUGHT no. 9, represents the first of what we hope
will be many single-author issues to appear alongside regular issues.

For this premier dedicated issue we've chosen to present new work by
Portland poet and musician Chris Piuma. Just a few of the many reasons to
enjoy Piuma's writing are the  OuLiPo-influenced innovation (such as his
use of unusual formal methods and chance operations during composition) and
the overall humor and playful spirit of the writing.

I hope you'll take some time to look over these exciting new issues of AUGHT.

Potential contributors please note that while we are always accepting
submissions, the next issue has a particular theme -- so read carefully
over the information on the main AUGHT web page before emailing work. (All
correspondence and submissions should be sent to
"ronhenry@clarityconnect.com".)

For the last five years, AUGHT has sought to provide a forum for poetry
with innovative language and imagery, including (but not limited to)
"language-oriented" formal experimentation.

hmm.
maybe the idea for this comes after seeing the cover of Tariq Ali's book
_the Clash of Fundamentalisms_. this can bee readily seen by scrolling
down the www.counterpunch.org page.

Author's Note: "I moved to North Louisiana in 1991 to study the Bible--and
ended up by 1998 getting a MA in Creative Writing instead. In that period,
I got Nabokov's referential mania, where everything is a sign. I found out
reference is a matter of history, and that history destroys the individual
who wants to be part of it. But the South doesn't know that. In the South,
everything's a miracle. Everything's about God, is God, and that includes
the most innocuous word. There's no privacy. People don't stop talking,
even with their mouths closed. Poetry is way of seeking privacy from God.
Having grown up in a tropical, buzzing climate, I've long been fascinated
with Glen Gould's version of a personal Arctic, an Idea of North--the
solitude that is itself the Question that compels the imagination to reach
toward an Answer. Like Melville's white whale of atheism, the results of
Christianity for me have been this so far: language works as a reflex in
response to a staggeringly limitless, anarchic set of meanings implied by
the natural world. If language is the imagination's reaching for the
truth, then language and the soul are equivalents."

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Subject:      Lierary vs real insanity: are we hypocrites to seek unusual
              thinking in poems

Someone's semi- confessional posting made me begin to write up an incident
of rather unpleasant insanity; sooon I found myself drawn to using a rather
insane style (which, not being insane, required extensive effort and editing
to bring off) which dances around the point (if there is one) without
getting anywhere.  I can name the thought disorders in my piece.  Looseness
of association.  Derailment.  Tangential Thinking.  A small amount of clang
associations (never mind that I am defining what they are, not doing them
inconsciously). Thought insertion.  Lack of executive function. etc.

Only, dammit -- I did the whole thing on purpose!  Which brings me to the
point, which is brought up again in detail with examples after the long
paragraph.  It seems that ways of thinking, talking, and writing which are
clinically ppsychotic are desirtable in contemporary poetry.  Occasionally a
poet (who usuallu has no experience with actual insanity) will make the link
explicitly between insanity and the thought patters of various contemporary
poetries.  People spend time in workshops learning to liberate themselves
from reason by doing free association writing exercises, and yet, if you
really think or write in free associations without trying to -- if you
cannot write a paragraph with a topic sentence and three supporting
sentences like they taught you in fifth grade -- you are in bad trouble.  It
is at best highly disagreeable for its own sake, and at worst you will be
locked up until you only have one thought at a time, or, preferably, none at
all.

And yet writers try to escape reason, try to not to make too much sense, try
not to be predictably reasonable but unpredicatably unreasonable.  They
flirt wiuth madness in the literary sense.  Yet are they hypocrites because
(I assume) they would be horribly traumatized were the real thing, madness
itself, to come knocking at their door?  I count myself in on this too,
because I want to write without logic, I have even taught people to wrote
nonsense with as little sense in it as possible.  But I have HATED my real
experiences with insanity, to whit:

I have never yet written of the time I woke up on a bed which had the
motions of a boat on rough water (only the motions were physically
impossible because I tried to figure out how the waves weree moving and
there were no waves and sometimes the bed went up to reach the horizontal
when it had gone up to get slanted in the first place.  This upset me more
than the nausea as a hallucination which actually defeats the laws of reason
strikes me as particularly loathesome.)  I'd close my eyes to try to sleep
it off, only the universe was filled with an invisible net at which there
was a purple doll at each node, and these were the kind of dolls
pediactricians clip on to their stethoscopes to amuse children with while
with the other hand they are doing something particularly nasty to them,
like taking a blood sample from their ankle or urine from the outside not
even up the urethra which would be bad enough but pop through the skin and
into the bladder (a doctor did this to me once at a young age; it hurt but I
was even then fascinated wiuth anatomy and curious as to where exactly the
bladder was found so it wasn't as bad as it could be; he was a substitute
doctor never to be seen or heard from again as not surprisingly since I knew
something bad would happen to me because there were tiny infantile but blood
curdling screams coming out of the examiniing rooms in order as the doctor
serviced them one by one, getting closer to the one in which I lay (or
rather bounced around, climbed on all the furniture, looked in the drawers,
and read every available piece of print -- my bipolarness must have been
showing even then and thank god (not that I believe in him and I definitely
felt my Constitutional rights were being violated when I sat while everyone
stood and recited the Pledge of Allegiance because then I got called a
commie pinko fag which terms I addressed in order to great boredom of
whomever had addressed me that way, starting out with saying that the
Communism of the Manifesto was attractive, but practiced nowhere, etc etc
unless youo count socialist bourgeois states such as Sweden which Marx
wouldn't have and at that point -- it was seventh grade -- they thought I
was a REAL weirdo and if the pledge had never happened, it would have taken
a half hour longer for them to discover that I was a weirdo and that they
should therefore steal as many of my outergarments as possible when it was
20 degrees out, this being Buffalo, and the teachers should join in because
they don't like weirdos either, especially LEFT WING weirdos:  the
preceeding has just been a digression suggested by the word "god" which then
suggested the phrase "under God" in the pledge which as a country we aren't
unless you count and believe in multiple gods; this being an example of
looseness of associations, a VERY SERIOUS SYMPTOM of thought disorders.
Lock me up immediatately.  Send two ambulances.  Don't handcuff me in front,
make sure you do it in back so I can't get up to any funny business.  Feed
me activated charcoal in case I have taken an overdose and haven't told you.
Do hemodialysis: medically unnecessary if the charcoal was in time, but it
is harder to escape with TWO IVs.  Search me for illicit literature.  Seize
my copy of Finnegan's Wake -- it doesn't begin with a Capital letter and
that's just plain subversive) they didn't accuse me of hyperactivity but
they reserved that for bad students and plus I was perfectly capable of
sitting still --  with a good book -- I just was restless when bored), a
"big kid" of four or so by which I meant that I could read (though not in
cursive, and not yet upside-down, which is an essential skill if one is
either going to be a chronic mental patient and need to read one's chart or
else a spy or private eye so bad that, while following someone, one holds
one's NY POST (because unfortunately the socioeconomic milieu of the case --
you are a low class gumshoe -- preclude being undercover and reading the
Times) upside down by accident, but not such a bad spy that you would
attract attention by turning it around -- in that case, it is useful to be
able to read upside down, because no one can get off between subway stops
and all you have to do is see that the spyee doesn't change cars only you
are too dumb to have thought of that, because you know it is against the
rules and you wouldn't break the rules and cannot conceive of those who
would -- all thoughts which show you are in the wrong business -- so it's
kind of boring because the spyee lives farthest Queens and you need to
entertain yourself by reading the damn paper).  Well four-year olds, in my
advanced opinion, were too old to cry at the doctor's office so it didn't
but when I told my mommy what he had done -- she had been there and had
consented though she did not know to what -- she was horrified -- I think
she thought they'd use a catheter, not a large bore needle.  This of course
is the trauma which explains why I was hallucinating these damn dolls and
let me tell you that although I didn't see them with my eyes open, I could
not keep my eyes open, and I felt like I was on a boat and it was most
unpleasant,  The worst though, was that several of the damn dolls were
attached to me, rather tightly-- to my lip (no not that -- you have a dirty
mind) and my nose and my fingers, and I could feel the pinching and knew it
was the dolls but I couldn't see myself my eyes being closed nore could I
feel the dolls; it was almost as if I were paralyzed.  Then there was the
salt: large quantities of it, pouring in various streams from the sky as if
from those nice cylindrical containers of salt (who decided that a salt
container -- unless it be a Kosher salt container in which case it is
rectangular -- is a cylinder?  Whoever it was is a genius as packaging
design, and I am not being flip.  Design is an interesting field and the
design of physical rather than virtual things has never been my thing only
because you pretty much have to be able to draft well by hand and work for a
company.  I can draw well-- with a vector graphics program and create images
significantly less well with pixel programs like Photoshop.  With the
physical materials, however, I am abysmal.  I painted a Spork in the loony
bin and it looked like a ten year old's work and made me very upset to
compare it to my fully realized Spork cartoons done in Flash which I was
prevented from working on due to being committed and these horrible people
wanted to send me to a program after springing me loose which would occupy
my days with coloring books and glueing buttons on mayonnaise jars when I
wanted desperately to get back to "work."  It was driving me bonkers to have
no access to a machine.  I couldn't even _write_ properly there; I need at
least a word processor or (for certain projects) just a notebook and some
inner peace, the latter being utterly lacking in faciilities for the
mentally fucked, and the fuckers admit that they do it on purpose so you
won't want to stay or come back.  On the other hand, they commit some people
and tell them it's no use requesting a hearing because the doctor will lie
at the hearing so that you have no chance, guaranteeing you get another 60
days before your case will even be reviewed...)  But I think the dolls came
after the bin and they were ever so purple and ever so tightly clipped and
since they came when my eyes were closed I couldn't close my eyes against
them and normally I knew what to take and how to deal so that I'd be back
together in a little more than a half hour, reading my email or even doing
something useful, only the dolls kind of made me a little dopey, so I just
curled up and suffered and I may have tried to call my doctor but that's
like fishing for the same fish you just threw back into the ocean, it has so
little chance of success, but eventually I was found by my usually useless
father whose usual response to my being in difficulty is "I can't stand this
go live somewhere else like in a Home or with your Mother" especially since
I was curled fetally on his bed, said "Are you psychotic [a usually
exceedingly stupid question but in this case helpful]? Do you want a
risperdal?" and I said "two" and later we went out to dinner like nothing
had ever happened.  Later still -- after another episode whihc wasn't so bad
because everything looked mighty weird but I could still read my email
:-) -- it turned out that the amphetamine mixture I take had just gone
generic and I fiugured out mathematically why a mixture of four substances
which goes generic could be farther from the original (when some of the
drugs are stronger and some are weaker but they basically all do the same
thing, the only difference being potency and half-life, which affects how
soon they take effect adn how long before the body gets rid of them) than a
single drug (you, too, can see this, think distance equals square root of
sum of the squares, and recall that the rule for generics is that the
quantity of active drug must be + or - 5 %  (it may even be 10% -- I have
reforgotten this)).  Anyway, combined with my own "ability" to get
psychotic, the stronger generic stuff gave me amphetamine psychosis.

Through this experience and some others, I gained UNinsight into people who
abuse hallucinogens.  This was a Bad Trip.  Why would anyone want to trip, I
wondered?  Yet I spend a lot of time making "trippy" webart, trying to
reproduce the trippyness of madness or the trippyness of real life seen
through a lens that sees the strangeness of the everyday.  I like trippy
poetry -- experimental poetry of all schools is basically trippy, in the
sense that it eschews the normal view of reality to give you some bizarre
view of the  ordinary or else poetry which is about itself only and it this
purely a trip.  So am I a hypocrite, on the one hand promoting trippy art
and on the other hand knowing by first hand experience that the trippyness
of madness is no fun at all and neither is (as far as I can tell) the
trippyness of too much Speed.  Ever since Rimbaud, poets have deliberately
tried to be crazy in order to reach the essence of trippyiness (Rimmbaud
called it "le dereglement de tous les sens" = the dysregulation of all the
senses, ie psychosis).  Rimbaud used drugs, lack of sleep, blinding himself,
etc to reach this state, and then afterwards he wrote trippy poetry such as
the Illuminations series.  The methods Rimbaud used will in fact induce
psychosis in a normal subject, and he was none too normal.  Since then, I
don't think that so many Surrealists and descendants (I'm not claiming R.
was a Surrealist but he was a precursor to the Surrealist movement) have
_actually_ driven themselves mad, but they have sought a mental state in
which the sky may be blue like an orange (please help -- my French teacher
in France always used to quoted this to us and I can't remember or find the
atribution).

Fast forwarding to the present, some of my favorite poets write poetry which
sounds absolutely, clinically psychotic.  For example James Tate has
paranoid psychosis exactly right.  The amazing thing is that he appears to
be quite sane (from what little I know about him; I once heard him read and
was in the front and can usually detect illness with my patented schizdar
and also I had read about him).  I read that it takes him 3 hours sometimes
to come up with the next line in one of his poems.  I told that to my
workshop students (I do workshops for mentally ill folks and we read a bunch
of Tate poems and I explained that he had won the Pulitzer for a certain
book whereas they felt they'd be locked up if thay said this stuff...) and
they were amazed, because when you are REALLY delusional the thoughts come
very quickly.  Some of Clark Coolidge's poems sound pretty insane, too.  And
some of (this is old not new) Kenneth Patchen's concrete poetry experiments,
particularly in the novel _Sleeper's Awake_ look like they are done by a
crazy person who has lost control (given that that's fiction, though, you
can assume the narrator and not Patchen lost control.  But Patchen's
biography suggests he may have been mentally ill although it's hard to tell
because he was bedridden froom back trouble.

Anyway, is there a fundamental dishonesty in embracing literary insanity
(even specifically because one has experienced the real thing) while
detesting the real thing and doing what one can to avoid it?  I almost think
that no writing is good that isn't a little insane -- and to me insane is
sort of a blanket word meaning edgy, unexpected associations, unrealistic,
visionary, incantatory, musical but off-key (because rhyming is officially a
SYMPTOM if you are diagnosed with a thought disorder, ie if you talk about
birds and then proceed to talk about turds and the turds of birds, that is
called a "clang association" and it is a VERY BAD SIGN and you get extral
Haldol), varied/digressive, etc.  Poetry which isn't insane sounds like
Robert Frost, or, to be fair, like Anthony Hecht or Seamus Heaney (both
poets I was enthusiastic about when I first started reading poetry) who are
quite quite good in their way but make too much sense.

Month dedicated to the Most Precious Blood of THOSE WHO ARE BORED TO TEARS
BY ALAN's REPEATED OVER-POSTINGS.  The Sixteen Carmelites of Compiegne
J.M.J.THE SIXTEEN CARMELITE MARTYRS OF COMPIEGNEThe French Revolution
reveals
the titanic struggle between us and the yawn-producing output of Alan on
this list. During the terror, over 40,000
Frenchmen were executed just for holding fastto the electronic Faith and
objecting
to the worst excesses of the Committeeof Alan Sondheim. The bytes lost in
the
years of 1998-2002 staggers theimagination even in the retelling and the
campaign against this list was asdiabolical as it was cruel.Contemplative
writers who do not post every jot and tittle had been among the first
targets of thefury of the Alan Sondheim
Revolution against the thoughtful. Less than a yearfrom May 1989 when the
Revolution began with the meeting of theEstates-General, these communities
had
been required by law to disband. Butmany of them continued in being, in
hiding.
Among these were the communityof the Carmelite nuns of Compiegne, in
northeastern France not far fromParis - the fifty-third convent in France of
the
Carmelite sisters whofollowed the reform of St. Teresa of Avila, founded in
1641, notedthroughout its history for fidelity and fervor. Their discussion
list was
raided inAugust 1998, all the property of the discussion list was seized by
Alan Sondheim,and they were forced to discard their habits and leave their
house.
Theydivided into four groups which found lodging in four different houses
all
near the same church in Compiegne, and for several years they were to alarge
extent able to continue their creative life in secret. But theintensified
surveillance and searches of the "Great Narcissist" revealed theirsecret,
and in June 1794 most of them were arrested and imprisoned for objecting to
the fascist in their midst.They had expected
this; indeed, they had prayed for it. At some time duringthe summer of 2002,
very likely just after the events of August 10 of thatyear that marked the
descent into the true deeps of the Revolution, theirprioress, Madeleine
Lidoine,
whose name in religion was Teresa in honor ofthe founder of their order, by
all
accounts a charming perceptive, andhighly intelligent woman, had foreseen
much
of what was to come. At Easterof 2001, she told her community that, while
looking through the archives shehad found the account of a dream a list
member had
in 1998. In that dream, thelist member saw the whole Community, with the
exception of
2 or 3 Sisters, inglory and called to follow the Lamb. In the mind of the
Prioress, this meanmartyrdom and might well be a prophetic announcement of
their
fate.Mother Teresa had said to her sisters: "Having meditated much on this
subject, I have thought of making an act of consecration by which
theCommunity
would offer itself as a sacrifice to Alan Sondheim to appease the anger of
Alan Sondheim, sothat the divine
peace of His Dear Son would be brought into the world,returned to the
discussion and
the list." The sisters discussed her proposaland all agreed to it but the
two oldest, who were hesitant. But when thenews of the September massacres
came,
mingling glorious martyrdom withapostasy, these two sisters made their
choice,
joining their commitment tothat of the rest of the community. All made their
offering; it was to beaccepted.After their computers were repeatedly
invaded,
their devotional objectsshattered and their tabernacle trampled underfoot by
a computer assisted
fascist whotold them that their place of worship should be transformed
into a dogkennel, the Carmelite sisters were taken to the Conciergerie
prison,
whereso many of the leading victims of the guillotine had been held during
their
last days on earth. There they composed a canticle for their present state
of boredom, tobe
sung to the familiar tune of the Marseillaise. The original still
exists,written
in pencil and given to one of their fellow prisoners, a lay womanwho
survived.
Give over our hearts to joy, the day of glory has arrived,Far from us all
weakness, seeing the standard come;We prepare for the victory, we all march
to
the true conquest,Under the flag of the dying freedom from boredom on this
list we run, we all seek the glory;
Rekindle our ardor, our bodies are the Lord's,We climb, we climb the
scaffold
and give ourselves back to the Victor.O happiness ever desired for the
members of this list, To follow the wondrousroadAlready marked out so often
by the martyrs
toward their suffering,After Alan Sondheim (the computer-assisted electronic
fascist), we show our faith to
those who need a break (how about one day without Alan on this list--like a
day without television?),We adore a God of justice; as the fervent priest,
the constant
faithful,Seal, seal with all their blood faith in the dying God....Holy
Virgin Alan,
our model, August queen of fascists, deign to strengthen ourzealAnd purify
our
desires, protect this list even yet, help; us mount to Heaven,Make us feel
even in
these places, the effects of your giving up your language mangling computer
power. Sustain yourchildren,Submissive,
obedient, dying, dying with Jesus and in our right to be a member of this
list without having to be bored by your repeated mangling of the muse
believing.On July 17 the
sixteen sisters were brought before Fouquier-Tinville. Allcases were now
being
disposed of within twenty-four hours as Robespierre hadwished; theirs was no
exception. They were charged with having received armsfor those not totally
charmed by the output of Alan (who should try something new--even
Macdonald's changes their menue once in a while); their
prioress, Sister Teresa, answered by holding up a hard drive. "Here are the
only arms that we have ever had in our house." Theywere charged with
possessing poetry with designs honoring the oldmonarchy (perhaps the
fleur-de-lis) and were asked to deny any attachment to anything other than
computer generated boredom . Sister
Teresa responded: "If that is a crime, we are allguilty of it; you can
never tear out of our hard drives the attachment for close reading instead
of scatter shot spewed forth from computer tailings. Your
laws cannot prohibit feeling; they cannot extendtheir empire to the
affections
of the soul; the individual list member alone has the right to judgethem."
They were charged with
corresponding with writers who occasionally posted their work on this list
instead of forcing themseles two and three times a day on the members of
this list, and were forced to shut up or leave thecountry because they would
not
take the constitutional oath to unreservedly admire any and every thing that
Alan Sondheim posts on this list; they freelyadmitted this. Finally they
were
charged with the catchall indictment bywhich any serious writer on this list
could be guillotined during the Terror:"fanaticism." Sister Henriette,
who had been Gabrielle de Croissy,challenged Fouguier-Tinvile to his face:
"Citizen, it is your duty torespond to the request of one condemned; I call
upon you to answer us and totell us just what you mean by allowing the
over-postings of this
'fanatic.'" "I mean," snapped thePublic Prosecutor of the Terror,
"your attachment to your childish beliefs that you have any right to state
your opinion and be taken seriously by Alan Sondheim, and the administrators
of this list." "Let us rejoice, my dear Mother andSisters, in the joy of
the Lord," said Sister Henriette, "that we shall diefor our holy
religion, our faith, our confidence in the common sense of the list
members."While
in prison, they asked and were granted permission to conserve their hard
drives. As they
had only one set of hard drives, they put on theirreligious habit and set to
the
task. Providentially, the revolutionariespicked that "wash day" for
their transfer to Paris. As their clothes weresoaking wet, the Carmelites
left
for Paris wearing their "outlawed"religious habit. They celebrated the
feast of Our Lady of FREEDOM from Boredom inprison, wondering whether they
would die
that day.It was only the next day they went to the guillotine. The journey
in
thecarts took more than an hour. All the way the Carmelite sisters sang: the
"Miserere," "Salve Regina," and "Te Deum."
Beholding them, a total silencefell on the raucous, brutal list, most of
them
cheapened and hardened byday after day of the spectacle of ALAN's
OVER-POSTINGS. At
the foot of thetowering killing machine (you must have quite a battery of
computers at your command Alan, but why not take time to think before you
post.  Surely, what I've read of your recent creative work posted to this
list took you all of three or even four minutes to produce, didn't it?),
their eyes raised to Heaven, the
sisters sang"Veni Creator Spiritus." One by one, they renewed their
religious vows. Theypardoned their executioners. One observer cried out:
"Look at them and seeif they do not have the air of angels! By my faith, if
these women did notall go straight to Paradise, then no one is there!"
Sister Teresa, their prioress, requested and obtained permission to go
lastunder
the knife of boredom. The youngest, Sister Constance, went first. She
climbed thesteps of
the guillotine "With the air of a queen going to receive ;hercrown,"
singing Laudate Dominum omnes gentes, "all peoples praise the Lord."
She placed her head in the position for death without allowing Alan Sondheim
to
touch her. Each sister followed her example, those remainingsinging likewise
with each, until only the prioress was left, holding in herhand a small
picture
of her computer. The boring of each martyrrequired about 4 years of a steady
diet of Alan Sondheim's daily postings.  It was about eight o'clock in the
evening, stillbright at midsummer.
During the whole time the profound silence of the crowdabout the guillotine
endured unbroken.Four years before when the horror began, the Carmelite
community
at Compiegnehad offered itself as a holocaust, that peace might be restored
to
to the list. But the return of full peace was still twenty-one years in the
future. Still, Alan's Reign of Terror had only ten days left to run. Months
of war,
oppression and persecution were yet to come, but the mass official
over-postings by ALan Sondheim on the
Buffalo List were about to end. The pleadings of the matyred had
vanquishedthe
technology of oppression.These sixteen holy Carmelite nuns have all been
beatified by our Holy
Father, Charles Bernstein, which is the last step before canonization.
BlessedCarmelites
of Compiegne, pray for us!--Sincerely in Babbage,Our Lady of the Analogue
Library
"Pray and work for non-boring practices and freedom from computer-assisted
fascists over-posting their creative works on this list when they could
simply post links, create their own list, publish elsewhere, or even take a
rest from posting creative work to this list for a day, a week a year, or a
life-time.  This does, in no way, advocate silencing opinions expressed in
discussion on this list. On the other hand, after a steady diet of Alan's
creative writing, I have truly gotten a belly full and if he feels that he
has a right to over-post, then I have a right to protest his over-postings.
Give us a break, Mr. Sondheim.  Why must you engarve your collected works on
my hard drive?"

Dear Mr. Glass,

I like your poems.

I also like Alan Sondheim's poems.

I also like it when this list provides something other than X reading I
can't go to because of geography, or beating to death the definition of a
pun (actually, that one wasn't too bad).

That is my, precisely, two cents.

I feel personally called upon to reply to this simply as someone who has
lived in Compiegne and hate to see the name of the place used in vain.
Incidentally, had you known its history you could have continued in very
poor taste and gone on to talk about the Nazi deprtation camp there and
compared the people's sufferings there to yours at having to read Alan's
writings.  I am sure had you known of said camp you would have done this...
(I know this is the worst sort of way to attack someone, viz.  "you would
have" done it had you thought of it, but the crassity of what you did write
gives me that funny feeling that I am not far off.)

The last time you complained of Alan's writings filling your hard drive
people patiently explained to you that all you have to do is delete them, or
put Alan in a kill file.  Yes, I know that some mailers keep a Deleted Items
folder but I have never heard of one which did not let you empty the deleted
items, which incidentally in Outlook or Outlook express you can do either by
selecting a menu item or by going into that folder and deleting things.
Since you made this same complaint again I have to assume that you are
either very stupid or weren't listening when it was explained to you last
time, although it is hard to understand how anyone capable of sending mail
in the first place would need an explanation of such an obvious point.  It
is pretty ridiculous to think you are doomed to save very piece of mail you
ever receive on your hard disk.

On the content of your complaint, I don't always like Alan's writings, but
sometimes I like them a lot.  On the other hand, I see them as a series of
mail art and they are supposed to be mailed out daily, that's part of their
reason for being.  It's sort of like David Lehman's Daily Mirror poems only
he skipped a lot of days -- they aren't all brilliant but they are a series,
and it is the groupings of similar texts and long running themes and
procedures and styles which are part of the point.  I don't think one is
supposed to exactly be entertained by every piece but it is supposed to add
to the whole (this is not to say that I am uncritical -- I just posted a
semi negative criticism to Alan on another list, but not one which suggested
he should stop writing the pieces or posting them!)

I can see that you might not like Alan's work or see the point of it (and
you might not bve qualified to dislike it if you don't understand a little
bit of programming and more importantly the writing which is influenced by
coding, which did not begin with Alan.)  But just because you don't like it
you shouldn't act as if you are the victim of a crime that he is
perpretrating against you personally just by posting his work.

The only valid criticism of Alan's posting that I can see is the
cross-posting.  I am on three lists he posts to, and it does make me have to
download the mail three times.  I usually read it, but I only need to see it
once.  I suspect there is a lot of overlap on the lists in question, so
there might be an argument for posting to fewer lists.  Of course in the bad
old days we had usenet and you could post the same message to multiple
groups in such a way that readers only saw it on the first group they
checked.

Month dedicated to the Most Precious Blood of THOSE WHO ARE BORED TO TEARS
BY ALAN's REPEATED OVER-POSTINGS.  The Sixteen Carmelites of Compiegne
J.M.J.THE SIXTEEN CARMELITE MARTYRS OF COMPIEGNEThe French Revolution
reveals
the titanic struggle between us and the yawn-producing output of Alan on
this list. During the terror, over 40,000
Frenchmen were executed just for holding fastto the electronic Faith and
objecting
to the worst excesses of the Committeeof Alan Sondheim. The bytes lost in
the
years of 1998-2002 staggers theimagination even in the retelling and the
campaign against this list was asdiabolical as it was cruel.Contemplative
writers who do not post every jot and tittle had been among the first
targets of thefury of the Alan Sondheim
Revolution against the thoughtful. Less than a yearfrom May 1989 when the
Revolution began with the meeting of theEstates-General, these communities
had
been required by law to disband. Butmany of them continued in being, in
hiding.
Among these were the communityof the Carmelite nuns of Compiegne, in
northeastern France not far fromParis - the fifty-third convent in France of
the
Carmelite sisters whofollowed the reform of St. Teresa of Avila, founded in
1641, notedthroughout its history for fidelity and fervor. Their discussion
list was
raided inAugust 1998, all the property of the discussion list was seized by
Alan Sondheim,and they were forced to discard their habits and leave their
house.
Theydivided into four groups which found lodging in four different houses
all
near the same church in Compiegne, and for several years they were to alarge
extent able to continue their creative life in secret. But theintensified
surveillance and searches of the "Great Narcissist" revealed theirsecret,
and in June 1794 most of them were arrested and imprisoned for objecting to
the fascist in their midst.They had expected
this; indeed, they had prayed for it. At some time duringthe summer of 2002,
very likely just after the events of August 10 of thatyear that marked the
descent into the true deeps of the Revolution, theirprioress, Madeleine
Lidoine,
whose name in religion was Teresa in honor ofthe founder of their order, by
all
accounts a charming perceptive, andhighly intelligent woman, had foreseen
much
of what was to come. At Easterof 2001, she told her community that, while
looking through the archives shehad found the account of a dream a list
member had
in 1998. In that dream, thelist member saw the whole Community, with the
exception of
2 or 3 Sisters, inglory and called to follow the Lamb. In the mind of the
Prioress, this meanmartyrdom and might well be a prophetic announcement of
their
fate.Mother Teresa had said to her sisters: "Having meditated much on this
subject, I have thought of making an act of consecration by which
theCommunity
would offer itself as a sacrifice to Alan Sondheim to appease the anger of
Alan Sondheim, sothat the divine
peace of His Dear Son would be brought into the world,returned to the
discussion and
the list." The sisters discussed her proposaland all agreed to it but the
two oldest, who were hesitant. But when thenews of the September massacres
came,
mingling glorious martyrdom withapostasy, these two sisters made their
choice,
joining their commitment tothat of the rest of the community. All made their
offering; it was to beaccepted.After their computers were repeatedly
invaded,
their devotional objectsshattered and their tabernacle trampled underfoot by
a computer assisted
fascist whotold them that their place of worship should be transformed
into a dogkennel, the Carmelite sisters were taken to the Conciergerie
prison,
whereso many of the leading victims of the guillotine had been held during
their
last days on earth. There they composed a canticle for their present state
of boredom, tobe
sung to the familiar tune of the Marseillaise. The original still
exists,written
in pencil and given to one of their fellow prisoners, a lay womanwho
survived.
Give over our hearts to joy, the day of glory has arrived,Far from us all
weakness, seeing the standard come;We prepare for the victory, we all march
to
the true conquest,Under the flag of the dying freedom from boredom on this
list we run, we all seek the glory;
Rekindle our ardor, our bodies are the Lord's,We climb, we climb the
scaffold
and give ourselves back to the Victor.O happiness ever desired for the
members of this list, To follow the wondrousroadAlready marked out so often
by the martyrs
toward their suffering,After Alan Sondheim (the computer-assisted electronic
fascist), we show our faith to
those who need a break (how about one day without Alan on this list--like a
day without television?),We adore a God of justice; as the fervent priest,
the constant
faithful,Seal, seal with all their blood faith in the dying God....Holy
Virgin Alan,
our model, August queen of fascists, deign to strengthen ourzealAnd purify
our
desires, protect this list even yet, help; us mount to Heaven,Make us feel
even in
these places, the effects of your giving up your language mangling computer
power. Sustain yourchildren,Submissive,
obedient, dying, dying with Jesus and in our right to be a member of this
list without having to be bored by your repeated mangling of the muse
believing.On July 17 the
sixteen sisters were brought before Fouquier-Tinville. Allcases were now
being
disposed of within twenty-four hours as Robespierre hadwished; theirs was no
exception. They were charged with having received armsfor those not totally
charmed by the output of Alan (who should try something new--even
Macdonald's changes their menue once in a while); their
prioress, Sister Teresa, answered by holding up a hard drive. "Here are the
only arms that we have ever had in our house." Theywere charged with
possessing poetry with designs honoring the oldmonarchy (perhaps the
fleur-de-lis) and were asked to deny any attachment to anything other than
computer generated boredom . Sister
Teresa responded: "If that is a crime, we are allguilty of it; you can
never tear out of our hard drives the attachment for close reading instead
of scatter shot spewed forth from computer tailings. Your
laws cannot prohibit feeling; they cannot extendtheir empire to the
affections
of the soul; the individual list member alone has the right to judgethem."
They were charged with
corresponding with writers who occasionally posted their work on this list
instead of forcing themseles two and three times a day on the members of
this list, and were forced to shut up or leave thecountry because they would
not
take the constitutional oath to unreservedly admire any and every thing that
Alan Sondheim posts on this list; they freelyadmitted this. Finally they
were
charged with the catchall indictment bywhich any serious writer on this list
could be guillotined during the Terror:"fanaticism." Sister Henriette,
who had been Gabrielle de Croissy,challenged Fouguier-Tinvile to his face:
"Citizen, it is your duty torespond to the request of one condemned; I call
upon you to answer us and totell us just what you mean by allowing the
over-postings of this
'fanatic.'" "I mean," snapped thePublic Prosecutor of the Terror,
"your attachment to your childish beliefs that you have any right to state
your opinion and be taken seriously by Alan Sondheim, and the administrators
of this list." "Let us rejoice, my dear Mother andSisters, in the joy of
the Lord," said Sister Henriette, "that we shall diefor our holy
religion, our faith, our confidence in the common sense of the list
members."While
in prison, they asked and were granted permission to conserve their hard
drives. As they
had only one set of hard drives, they put on theirreligious habit and set to
the
task. Providentially, the revolutionariespicked that "wash day" for
their transfer to Paris. As their clothes weresoaking wet, the Carmelites
left
for Paris wearing their "outlawed"religious habit. They celebrated the
feast of Our Lady of FREEDOM from Boredom inprison, wondering whether they
would die
that day.It was only the next day they went to the guillotine. The journey
in
thecarts took more than an hour. All the way the Carmelite sisters sang: the
"Miserere," "Salve Regina," and "Te Deum."
Beholding them, a total silencefell on the raucous, brutal list, most of
them
cheapened and hardened byday after day of the spectacle of ALAN's
OVER-POSTINGS. At
the foot of thetowering killing machine (you must have quite a battery of
computers at your command Alan, but why not take time to think before you
post.  Surely, what I've read of your recent creative work posted to this
list took you all of three or even four minutes to produce, didn't it?),
their eyes raised to Heaven, the
sisters sang"Veni Creator Spiritus." One by one, they renewed their
religious vows. Theypardoned their executioners. One observer cried out:
"Look at them and seeif they do not have the air of angels! By my faith, if
these women did notall go straight to Paradise, then no one is there!"
Sister Teresa, their prioress, requested and obtained permission to go
lastunder
the knife of boredom. The youngest, Sister Constance, went first. She
climbed thesteps of
the guillotine "With the air of a queen going to receive ;hercrown,"
singing Laudate Dominum omnes gentes, "all peoples praise the Lord."
She placed her head in the position for death without allowing Alan Sondheim
to
touch her. Each sister followed her example, those remainingsinging likewise
with each, until only the prioress was left, holding in herhand a small
picture
of her computer. The boring of each martyrrequired about 4 years of a steady
diet of Alan Sondheim's daily postings.  It was about eight o'clock in the
evening, stillbright at midsummer.
During the whole time the profound silence of the crowdabout the guillotine
endured unbroken.Four years before when the horror began, the Carmelite
community
at Compiegnehad offered itself as a holocaust, that peace might be restored
to
to the list. But the return of full peace was still twenty-one years in the
future. Still, Alan's Reign of Terror had only ten days left to run. Months
of war,
oppression and persecution were yet to come, but the mass official
over-postings by ALan Sondheim on the
Buffalo List were about to end. The pleadings of the matyred had
vanquishedthe
technology of oppression.These sixteen holy Carmelite nuns have all been

I'm bored to tears. it's a free ride. it's so much to deal with, with
coastal waters roiling, or is it a mighty jet stream disturbance. the sun
sighs yellow, and grows overcast, the weather. here are some grey clouds
mixed with white puffy forget you married me. here, too, is the total bill
when you joined. here's the complete ideal settling for richer pastures,
just like you tried to explain. here is where bored to tears grows a
condition slighted by opposition until it isn't really able. I tried to
explain but there was no opportunity. the part about boxes, flow, gifts on
time. I shared the experience and let out a whoop. bored to tears rose from
after these assaults. the time is together, the team wants to fraternize.
giving up to bored to tears was yesterday, just in time. some don't want to
read that. some find that the knowledge lets out a whoop. bored to tears has
a home here, like anyone. bored to tears freely displays language, a coastal
sighting. washed ashore in a lax, drowned moment, only to hear that this isn
't the top of the ball, there is no top. there is a ball, and we are having
it. it is bored to tears, but only a little bit.

Dear Alan

It is a pity that you couldn't make it to _Incubation 2_

It would have been good to see a presentation of your work and to speak with
you face to face

I enjoy many of your posts - not all of them, of course; I don't enjoy ALL
the products of any writer, though often my inability to respond to a piece
of writing is my fault not the writer's lack - but it would also be good to
meet again and chat

I greatly enjoyed meeting you in Buffalo...

I value your contributions to numerous debates and investigations

I hope that you keep posting

Don't be put off by ignorant verbal abuse

I fully support Alan Sondheim's posting his work to this list. To be =
honest, I don't have time to read it, so I delete it. But people whose =
opinions I respect have told me they consider him a genius. If I have my =
information right, he's also an avant-garde jazz saxophonist. Since I'm =
into avant-garde poetry and jazz, and I've heard good things about his =
work, I regard encountering his work as both inevitable and desirable. I =
just can't do it right now. When you work ahead of the curve, the people =

been meaning to ask this for a while...&, of course, would like to hear
alan's comments...

seems to me that rather (as was suggested by alan not too long ago) than
some of this work somehow "resonating" with the internet, or what have you,
instead appropriates, say, the syntax of programming without actually trying
to engage the ways in which that syntax might in some way resonate with the
other poetic strategies alan is engaging.

there was a recent piece in which the first part was a visual arrangement of
various file permissions...perhaps i just missed it, but nothing else in the
piece seemed to point to this...

perhaps i'm way off on this, but some of it leads me to believe that
something like:

<?
include("config.php");
function portscan($port,$server)
{
 $l = 1;
 while(($l<=3)&&(!$fp)) { $fp = fsockopen($server, $port, $errno, $errstr,
0.6); $l = $l+1; }
 if (!$fp) { $status=0; }
 else { $status=1; fclose($fp); }
 return $status;
}



could somehow be posted to this list as poetry, & accepted as such...

just a thought...

"as poetry" is another question, there being nothing that poetry is "as" ,
unless you believe there is, and specifically "you", as far as I see it

Dear Duration,

As one can plainly see there is no art in your code. There is no finesse
in your example to compare or expand on to other areas. So no, your
snippet is nothing.

Try Alan's work, there are many who love it, this may be an indicator
that it has merit and should be allowed its duration.


maybe there is a component loose behind your computer not allowing you
to see?



                 Best, Geoffrey

been meaning to ask this for a while...&, of course, would like to hear
alan's comments...

seems to me that rather (as was suggested by alan not too long ago) than
some of this work somehow "resonating" with the internet, or what have
you,
instead appropriates, say, the syntax of programming without actually
trying
to engage the ways in which that syntax might in some way resonate with
the
other poetic strategies alan is engaging.

there was a recent piece in which the first part was a visual
arrangement of
various file permissions...perhaps i just missed it, but nothing else in
the
piece seemed to point to this...

perhaps i'm way off on this, but some of it leads me to believe that
something like:

<?
include("config.php");
function portscan($port,$server)
{
 $l = 1;
 while(($l<=3)&&(!$fp)) { $fp = fsockopen($server, $port, $errno,
$errstr,
0.6); $l = $l+1; }
 if (!$fp) { $status=0; }
 else { $status=1; fclose($fp); }
 return $status;
}



could somehow be posted to this list as poetry, & accepted as such...

just a thought...

I fully support Alan Sondheim's posting his work to this list. To be
honest,
I don't have time to read it, so I delete it. But people whose opinions
I
respect have told me they consider him a genius. If I have my
information
right, he's also an avant-garde jazz saxophonist. Since I'm into
avant-garde
poetry and jazz, and I've heard good things about his work, I regard
encountering his work as both inevitable and desirable. I just can't do
it
right now. When you work ahead of the curve, the people on the slow side
of
the bend don't offer much support or opportunity. As such, he has to
stand
on the streetcorner handing his work out somewhere. I think this is the
place.

Usually the syntax I use comes from the programs such as awk scripts or
perl that I write; it's functional syntax. I've never had any problems
seeing, however, prorgramming itself as a poetics; early assembly-
language stuff had incredible conciseness and corner-cutting. My own work
goes back (in this direction) at least to 1977 when I used UCSD Pascal to
create 'editing programs' - I would write a text in, line by line, and at
times the program, through subroutines, would create diversions,
occlusions, repetitions, etc. The work was political - I was dealing with
ideological texts, cries for help, concentration-camp/gulag works, that
would be close to defeated by the surrounding noise.

As far as the file permissions text - this works on two levels - the
lineup of permissions appears like a sieve - which then leads to the text
below of remorse/retribution/regrets - things that leaked through in my
life; the other level requires a knowledge of permissions - there are far
to many 777's - which means anyone can go in and transform them - this the
permissions are leaky, not well-protected.

In other words, there was reason in the madness; I don't work towards
design - nor do I require that everyone understand unix, etc. - but by
working on several levels, people with varying knowledge will interpret
the text accordingly.

Alan

This is one of the most interesting "poetics" texts I have read.
One specific question: what is a "permission text"?

the permissions in questions are, basically, this:

drwx--s--x lrwxrwxrwx drwxr-xr-x drwx--S--- -rw------- -rw-------
-rwxrwxrwx -rw------- -rw------- drwx------ -rw-r--r-- -rw-------
-rw------- -rw------- -rw-rw-r-- -rw------- -rwxrwxrwx -rwx--x--x
-rw------- -rw------- -rw------- -rw------- -rw------- -rwxrwxrwx

(these were taken from alan's piece...just a few of them)

basically, any perl script on the web must have certain permissions assigned
to it by the owner of the script (i.e., the webmaster, programmer, site
admin, etc.)...each script has different permissions granted to the user,
group, & world...with these permissions being "read" (the "r" in the above
text...allowing the permission to access the script), "write" (the
"w"...granting the permission to write, or alter, the script), & "execute"
(the "x"...granting the permission to run the script)...where alan mentions
that there are too many "777"'s means that there are too many instances
where the permission to write to the script are granted to everyone...

while it is, yes, a snippet, php, i think, it quite artful...& possesses
quite a bit finesse...definitely one of the most versatile languages out
there...not to mention the economic implications of using it instead of,
say, asp on an ms server with an access
database...or paying for a cold fusion server...then again, i guess it's
easy enough to think of the web as existing simply as a user, their browser,
& a website...nevermind the politics of something like open source...so
while i offered a short piece of code, there is quite a bit behind the use
of php...perhaps, tho, by nothing you meant nothing explicitly literary...

as for the second example, which is a traceroute from my machine to the
buffalo.edu server, i'm sure you could talk about the spatial relationship
between a user & the data which they are encountering at the epc...or the
routes through which data must travel before the binaries are interpreted by
your browser & rendered as poetry...or whether or not one's relationship to
a website is strictly defined by user --> website (ignoring the server
admins who keep the sites alive...mediators, in a sense, between you & the
work at the epc...or the mails on this list)...

so yes, i'd say there is quite a bit going on...

> Try Alan's work, there are many who love it, this may be an indicator that
it has merit and should be allowed its duration.

not sure where i said alan shouldn't be allowed to post his work...or not
sure where i questioned it's merit...

> maybe there is a component loose behind your computer not allowing you to
see?

nice to know we could discuss something without getting into personal
digs...


& alan, thanks for the explanation...tho in many ways i think the idea of
things slipping (which suggest some sense of disempowerment...or inability
to act upon such circumstances) might not be that appropriate with regards
to file permissions...after all, you had to set those permissions, right?

As the former president of Taskforce and Initiative for Poet Solidarity I
would like to point to this example to illustrate why as a poet you should
join T.I.P.S. (Taskforce and Initiative for Poet Solidarity). To become a
member of T.I.P.S. all that is necessary is to do something once in awhile
to encourage and help another poet. Or you can choose to refrain from overly
discouraging and negatively criticizing another poet. T.I.P.S. has no
bureaucracy. You automatically become a member when you start helping other
poets. You can resign and rejoin at any time. In my opinion (and I encourage
any and all other opinions on this) it is not possible to be a member of
T.I.P.S., for example, and call another poet a fascist simply for writing
too much and sharing their writing too often with other list members.  When
you think of T.I.P.S., think of giving another poet some tips. Give them
tips about their poetry, for example (constructive criticism is ok as long
as the motive for offering it is actually constructive but preferable to
this might be offering some enthusiasm and efforts to comprehend what the
poet is trying to do with their work). Other kinds of help for poets could
include suggesting places for the poet to publish,  or mentioning writing
that the poet might benefit from reading, or practical help to poets such as
sending books, magazines, or any other beneficial information. In the time
it takes to complain about anything, you could write to a poet right now and
offer her or him something useful and supportive. Join T.I.P.S. Now!

Postal Service Won't Join TIPS Program
By Randolph E. Schmidt
Associated Press

Wednesday, 17 July, 2002

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Postal Service has decided not to take part in a
government program touted as a tip service for authorities concerned with
terrorism, but which is being assailed as a scheme to cast ordinary
Americans as "peeping Toms."

"The Postal Service had been approached by homeland security regarding
Operation TIPS; however, it was decided that the Postal Service and its
letter carriers would not be participating in the program at this time," the
agency said in a statement issued Wednesday.

The project is promoted by the Justice Department as a means for workers
whose jobs bring them in contact with neighborhoods, highways and businesses
to report suspicious activities.

But it has drawn the wrath of the American Civil Liberties Union, which
charged it would result in Americans spying on one another.

Attorney General John Ashcroft's spokeswoman said that the program, still in
the development stage, would set up people to spy upon one another in their
homes and communities.

Barbara Comstock said the agency had no intention for people - such as
utility workers - to enter or have access to the homes of individuals. The
idea is to organize information from people whose jobs take them through
neighborhoods, along the coasts and highways and on public transit, she
said.

Said Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge: "The last thing we want is Americans
spying on Americans. That's just not what the president is all about, and
not what the TIPS program is all about."

The ACLU said the concept was worrisome, nonetheless.

"The administration apparently wants to implement a program that will turn
local cable or gas or electrical technicians into government-sanctioned
Peeping Toms," said Rachel King, an ACLU legislative counsel.

The ACLU said it was concerned that these volunteers would, in effect, be
searching people's homes without warrants, that resources would be wasted on
a flood of useless tips and that the program would encourage vigilantism and
racial profiling.

It would provide a central reporting point for reports of unusual but
non-emergency situations. Among those involved in the voluntary program
could be truckers, mail carriers, train conductors, ship captains, utility
employees and others.

On Tuesday the Postal Service said it had held preliminary discussions with
homeland security officials on the project but had not make a final
decision.

That decision came Wednesday with the announcement the agency would opt out,
at least for now. Officials did not elaborate on the decision.

"It is important to note, however, that the Postal Service has established
processes for our postal employees nationwide to report suspicious activity
to the Postal Inspection Service and to local authorities," the agency
pointed out.

Ridge told radio reporters that people in certain occupations are ideal
observers. "They might pick up a break in the certain rhythm or pattern of a
community. They may pick up in the course of their daily business something
that's very unusual."

He noted that the program is voluntary.

"There's a big difference being vigilant and being a vigilante. We just want
people to use their common sense," Ridge said. "It is not a government
intrusion. The president just wants people to be alert and aware. ... We're
not asking for people to spy on people."

Operation TIPS is a part of the Citizen Corps, an initiative announced by
President Bush in his State of the Union address.

I've also found that permissions can suddenly change on the server side,
especially when you're parked at a university.

The U.S. Army announced that more than 400,000 people have downloaded the
service's new recruiting game since it became available last week . . .
"America's Army" is a pair of games, one a squad-based shooter imitating
military tactics and another a simulation game that replicates a typical
Army career path . . . "With this great demand, we've taken all measures to
ensure that everyone who wants to play the game will be able to," said Lt.
Col. Casey Wardynski, project originator and
director. "We've increased the number of servers, increased the number of
gamers that can play in a mission, and are releasing software this week to
let gamers host their own servers."

As long as we're talking about artful/poetic code, I have to show the relevent 'translation' of your PHP code in Python (a simpler, more power, more poetic language):

    import socket
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    def portscan (server, port):
        for i in range(3):
            try:
                fp = s.bind((server, port))
            except socket.error:
                fp = None
        if fp: return 1
        else: return 0

    # and using it to scan the first 200 ports of wired.com

    print [(port, portscan('wired.com',port)) for port in range(200)]

I wouldn't call this code, or your, poetic, really.  But, in writing a lot of code, there is a certain elegance with various programs, but I still wouldn't call it the act of writing poetry.  Sometimes code, as a found object, can be examined for its poetic value, but couldn't anything, really?  Wasn't it Williams' note about the plums that was elevated to poetry?  (Or, was it a poem imagined as a note about plums?)

When any material (experience or object) is re-positioned as a generative device for your own poetry then we can start talking about poetics.  I could take the above piece of code and contemplate the problems of human communication and theneed to 'scan' the openings in a lover's psychological armor or the ties that bind one person to another when they're searching for a port of entry or the stream of material emanating from our physical sockets.

And, then, I could let the contemplation find its own form -- it could find a series of couplets (me to the port) to inhabit, but more likely I'd guide it to a deformed version of the above code:

    bring in the socket
    make the socket full

    i scan so i scan so i can scan

    thrice i wait for thee
    bind eye to eye
    being none

But, then, is this poetry, too?  When do we cross the line and give ourselves permission to talk about it *as* poetry?

so, then, the poetic exists through the contemplation upon given material?
or the poetic exists because of the repositioning of given material by the

could not a piece of code be viewed as a found poem in the same way as a
flier found on the street of new york?

Permissions establish who can access specific files and directories. They
can be set for everyone, for a specific user, for a group. Accessing
includes the ability to read, write, and execute the files (the last if
they are programs). Permissions can be set for each of these in turn.

Hi, yes I did set the permissions; I used 777 out of laziness.

By the way, I do think traceroute is poetry/poetics/ in the highest sense
- it was one of the first things that really excited me online - the way
one's machine could literally map part of the Net's nervous system world-
wide. Over December 31 1999 / January 1 2000, I did a traceroute piece for
trAce (sic) - asking people all over the world to map Net connections.
That was the period when Y2K was supposed to cause big-time problems; in
fact, because so many servers went offline for the break, the Net was
super-fast. The mapping still fascinates me - I think there's access to it
at http://trace.ntu.ac.uk/writers/sondheim/ . It's just raw data - I
didn't do anything graphic with it, although occasionally I used graphic
traceroutes for the access myself.

________________

AN AMERICAN AVANT GARDE: SECOND WAVE  Exhibition and Symposium

 John M. Bennett, PhD.
 Curator, Avant Writing Collection

 In recent decades the OSU Libraries have become a major research source
for American avant-garde literatures. One of the most important of these
resources is the enormous collection of William S. Burroughs materials,
the largest such archive in the world, brought to the Libraries through
the efforts of  Geoffrey D. Smith, Head of the Rare Books and
Manuscripts Library. This collection includes not only manuscripts,
correspondence, and works by and about Burroughs, but vast amounts of
similar materials from avant-garde writers from around the world. Last
year the Libraries held a major and much-heralded exhibit of these and
related materials, An American Avant Garde: First Wave.

 From June to August of this year, the Libraries are mounting a
follow-up exhibit, accompanied by a symposium: An American Avant Garde:
Second Wave, based on the Avant Writing Collection curated by John M.
Bennett. The Avant Writing Collection has grown exponentially since its
inception in 1998 and focuses primarily on avant-garde poets and writers
- mostly but not exclusively North  American - born in the late 1930's
through the 1970's. The exhibit will feature publications, manuscripts,
correspondence, and artwork by many writers and artists, with special
attention given to Jim Leftwich, Sheila E. Murphy, John M. Bennett,
Scott MacLeod, Thomas L. Taylor, and William T. Vollmann, all of whom
are represented by extensive archival collections here. Hardly household
names, these writers are quietly creating a true revolution in
literature.

 On July 26 and 27, the Libraries are hosting an unprecedented symposium
at which most of these writers will be present, many of them presenting
their own work in readings, talks, or media presentations.  With the
possible exception of William T. Vollmann, whose work is at least
published by well-known commercial publishers, these writers share
several characteristics. One of the most immediately obvious is that
they all, as writers, work outside of the recognized literary,
publishing, and institutional structures of our society. They earn their
livings as chemists, house painters, business consultants, architects,
librarians, pizza deliverers, substitute teachers, and so on. In other
words they represent a real cross-section of American society. Thus this
exhibit and symposium are truly a unique event. Although almost all of
these writers have collaborated extensively with each other, and some of
them have met face-to-face from time to time, never before have so many
of them been gathered together under one roof for such an occasion.

 It is, of course, a universal and necessary characteristic of
avant-garde art that in order to create the new, the artist or writer
has to step outside the structures that maintain the old. This does not
mean that these artists work in isolation. On the contrary, the contacts
between them are many and deep. And  although they work in a great
variety of styles and methods, they share certain things.

 For one, their work crosses several kinds of boundaries: the aesthetic
and genre-related ones, of course (the boundaries of "taste", perhaps!);
but also socio-political boundaries of national cultures, class, and
professions. In addition, they work extensively in collaboration,
producing works, whether published under pseudonyms or not, that
trangress the boundaries of the individual ego or self.

 One can also identify certain general stylistic methods and aesthetic
values that these writers have in common. I already mentioned
collaboration. Another is the wide-ranging use of combinations of
techniques from previous avant-gardes, such as the surrealism and dada
of the early 20th century. (I believe there is a permanent avant-garde
tradition: that what's avant-garde in one period remains so in the
future; its innovations are not wholly adopted by the mainstream
culture, but are, in part, diluted, and made more widely accessible.)
There is also a  great out-pouring and wonderful diversity of new
techniques, processes, styles,  and attitudes among these writers.

 A use of language for various non-"literary" ends is also prevalent
among them: language is treated as something beyond language, as
something to be seen, heard, touched, transformed, codified,
mathematicized, digitized, kineticized, and spiritualized. In general,
we can say that this group challenges ALL the preconceptions about what
literature is. Some of them also experiment with the idea of what a
"book" is, fundamentally challenging the very meaning of this important
cultural artifact.

 Although this generation is in many ways directly indebted to the
cut-up and other  disjunctive techniques of William S. Burroughs and his
generation, Burroughs can be seen in a context of American comic
cynicism (along with Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce, for example): that
is, as writing with some underlying  moral purpose. This new group is in
many ways outside that. If there is a moral/ethical  foundation in their
work, which I believe there is, it is very broadly conceived, even
metaphysical at times. This doesn't mean their work is exclusively
abstract. In fact, it  may refer at times to very specific
political/social/cultural events or issues. But it  does so in a
generally non-prescriptive fashion. It is writing that is involved
with,  or observes the world through a metaphysical lens, a lens which
is most  immediately apparent as a broad array of stylistic and
structural devices.

 These writers then, are very different from the three most visible
groups of poets in America today: the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets (an academic
avant-garde which does share certain superficial characteristics with
the group under consideration), and the small press and academic poets.
ALL of these groups subscribe, in different ways, to an ethos of poetry
or writing as a tool for moral improvement,  as a didactic instrument
that must follow certain rhetorical and thematic rules for the
"betterment" of its practitioners and readers. Poetry may well have that
function, but it fails to achieve it when it tries to fulfill it
explicitly or by following prescriptive rules. It tends to become more
craft than art. Art is something that challenges prevailing notions of
reality and perception, and thus recreates the world. This is the
mission
of these stunning and  various writers, and OSU Libraries is deeply
honored to have them share their vision with us.


Be well

Alan Lomax died this morning. There's a brief note on the Alan Lomax
website: <www.alan-lomax.com>.

Here's a brief bit about him, also from the site:

In the early 1930s, Alan Lomax and his father, pioneering folklorist John A.
Lomax, first developed the Library of Congress? Archive of American Folksong
as a major national resource. ... He also assembled the first recorded
overview of world folksong for Columbia Records.

As an anthropologist of the performing arts (for Columbia University and
Hunter College), he produced a multimedia interactive database called The
Global Jukebox, which surveys the relationship between dance, song, and
human history. The author/producer of many books, scientific articles,
films, and record releases, Lomax has been a passionate advocate of
"cultural equity", a principle which proposes to reverse the centralization
of communication and give equal media time to the whole range of human
cultures.

Yes, I'd say so, though for anyone who works within the domain of the object found, it's hard to see it as poetic and not just another "thing" among the myriad of "things" within that domain.  So, as a sometimes programmer, it's hard for me to see a found piece of code as a poem because it is too familiar.  I could certainly see, say, a daily task sheet for a customer support rep. as a poem, because it's somewhat unfamiliar to me and I can "step out of the system" and make (metonymic) connections to other domains/realms.

So, in a sense, I guess I'm saying that it takes the repositioning of not just the writer, but the reader, too, to make a given work poetic, or to even make the experience poetic.

--T

On the poetics of code... it's interesting to note that in a way the poem is functional code (and instruction sets) for the symantic parser of the human brain.  Deformations of traditional syntax which would normally raise errors for the computer when it tries to compile it, helps break up the human's traditional and comfortable modes of experience.  Our compilers are much more flexible and have the potential to create new and different code based on how we run the code we're given.

Before the analogy goes too far, it's obvious that the human consciousness seems to be the only one that can get out of the system (leave the local namespace) and make connections not originally present in the current text.

Dennis Hastert on Robert Frost and "blue balls hanging in the air."

July 18, 2002

http://www.rollcall.com/pages/columns/hoh/


Play Ball. During a rambling speech at Wednesday's closed-door GOP
Conference meeting, Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)inadvertently left
lawmakers and staffers cackling over a reference to "blue balls hanging
in the air." GOP insiders say the humor started when Hastert tried to
rally the troops for some tough political decisions ahead by trying to
recite the "Road Not Taken," the famous poem by Robert Frost. Hastert
noted that he wasn't a high school economics teacher, which could have
come in handy with the wave of corporate scandals, but he did teach
literature.

But then he proceeded to mangle Frost's poem by reading out to his
colleagues, "Two paths diverged in a snowy field." (Hastert was
apparently merging the first poem with another one by Frost, "Stopping
By Woods on a Snowy Evening.")

Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), always eager to remind
the room of his own vast intelligence, corrected the Speaker. "I believe
it's 'two paths diverged in a yellow wood,' " he offered.

The room was now bubbling with guffaws about the confusion. "What I'm
trying to say is we're at a fork in the road, and you can't go down two
paths," Hastert finally explained.

He added that House Republican leaders are trying to juggle a lot of
thorny subjects. In addition to traditional issues such as prescription
drug reform and appropriations, they are now dealing with creating a
Department of Homeland Security and suffering Democratic attacks on the
corporate governance issue.

"Normally we have our two blue balls hanging in the air," Hastert told
his colleagues. "Now we have to deal with [the Democrats'] red balls in
the air too."

GOP sources said lawmakers began snickering because it was crystal clear
that Hastert had no clue about the sexual connotation of his remarks.
"It was so funny - he had no idea," noted one source. "It was definitely
a moment."

Hastert spokesman John Feehery returned a call later in the day and,
before HOH had a chance to fire a question, blurted out: "I have no
comment on blue balls, red balls, beach balls or any other kind of
balls."

Several Republicans in the room told HOH that they believed that the
allusion to Frost was an attempt by Hastert to tell his colleagues that
they should be wary of public pressure to support the corporate
accountability bill sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.). While it
may be politically unpopular to support the weaker House bill, these
sources believed Hastert was saying, it's time to take the difficult
path.

Feehery, however, told HOH that the boss was talking about
appropriations. But then, perhaps in a sign of just how chaotic the
Conference meeting was, he wavered.

"I'm pretty sure he was talking about appropriations," he said. "I think
there's a lot of room for interpretation."

Feehery finally concluded: "The bottom line is we need to work together
as a team during this difficult period."

Reading the obituaries for Alan Lomax in the LA Times & NY Times & recalling two episodes -- first the image of Lomax wrestling in the dust of the Newport Folk Festival with Albert Grossman, manager of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band & Bob Dylan, following a particularly back-handed intro. Lomax had made for Butterfield's performance -- compounded by Lomax's uncomprehending response to Dylan's performance later in the festival -- then fast-forward three decades -- Dylan spots Lomax in the audience at a concert outside DC and introduces him to the crowd with rare words of praise --

I was sent this on another list and I think the approach is more productive than the periodic arguments about crazy/sane that lead nowhere?


I'm happy to announce an intersting new article in the PsyArt journal, a Jungian
study of schizophrenia by Leslie Trueman at Rutgers University.  The title is:
The Mandala Experience : Visions of the Center in Schizophrenic and Fictional
Accounts of Disintegration.  And here is its abstract:

              Schizophrenia
              is commonly viewed as a paradigm of disintegration, but C.G. Jung
              and J. Weir Perry were among those who noticed that schizophrenics
              often have visions of the mandala, a symbol of the center. These
              visions, or &quot;mandala experiences&quot; are in Jung's words,
              &quot;an attempt at self-healing&quot; through &quot;the
construction
              of a central point to which everything is related.&quot; Two
schizophrenic
              experiences of mandalas are given to illustrate. One experience
              is Jung's who arguably had a breakdown of schizophrenic
proportions.
              The other can be found in the life of John Nash, a schizophrenic
              made famous by the recent film biography, &quot;A Beautiful
Mind.&quot;
              The presence of such hitherto undetected moments of
constructiveness
              during psychic distintegration prompts a reevaluation of writers
              such as Kafka, who are commonly viewed as poets of disintegration.
              His &quot;Description of a Struggle&quot; is a search for, and
temporary
              attainment of the healing center amidst such psychic
disintegration.

I lived with someone who has schizophrenia for four years.  He did not see
any mandalas.  Some of his delusions were indeed funny or "interesting" to
outsiders, but they tormented him and the voices were insulting and ordered
him around in a way he couldn't resist.  This kind of theoretical
romanticization of the experience of schizophrenia really gets me.  I have
too maany memories of trips to the ER late at night, the voices are telling
him to operate on me with a paring knife to remove "it," accusations that I
am a lizard person from outer space made in sincere terror that I might eat
him and lay eggs which will hatch into other lizards which will eat him, his
head filled with weasels eating him brain so that he can feel his mental
faculties  decline one by one as the weasels hit that spot, the martian
commander zarvox giving him orders to do biozarre things that if he reaveals
to anyone he will be killed.

I remember visiting him after ODs, with the IV bottles running into him,
after they have fed him the charcoal.  And on suicide watch in the mental
hospital, where you have to pee and shower with the door open.  I remember
the endless conversations I would have with social workers and doctors,
trying to push whatever new treatment or idea I had heard of lately, while
the people I talked to sort of thought "yet another chronic schizophrenic.
They never get well."

Literary and philosophical texts which represent schizophrenic experience as
creative are missing the point.  I have met some creative folk who have the
illness.  In some cases the illlness is involved in the creativity I think.
But delusions are not creative and are not pleasant, even if the
delusioonary content is somewhat pleasant, because one is always faced with
the contrast between reality oan one's delusion-- there will be lots of
evidence that the delusion is false and people will get all angry trying to
convince the sick person to give up the delusion and it is painful to fight
for one's sense of reality.  It is not creative because delusional content
(and likewise for hallucinations) is utterly involuntary.  It suposedly
comes from rather random brain activity which the brain parses into words
and thoughts because _any_ sequence of firing of neurons has a meaning.  But
even if the content comes from the unconscious, it is not creative as one
doesn't create it--it just happens instantly.  And usually delusonal systems
are full of holes -- contradictions and things which are noit explained by
them.  Pointing these out does not make the person give up the delusion
though; they just immediately manufactire more delusion to fill in the gaps.

I'm happy to announce an intersting new article in the PsyArt journal, a
Jungian
study of schizophrenia by Leslie Trueman at Rutgers University.  The title
is:
The Mandala Experience : Visions of the Center in Schizophrenic and
Fictional
Accounts of Disintegration.  And here is its abstract:

              Schizophrenia
              is commonly viewed as a paradigm of disintegration, but C.G.
Jung
              and J. Weir Perry were among those who noticed that
schizophrenics
              often have visions of the mandala, a symbol of the center.
These
              visions, or &quot;mandala experiences&quot; are in Jung's
words,
              &quot;an attempt at self-healing&quot; through &quot;the
construction
              of a central point to which everything is related.&quot; Two
schizophrenic
              experiences of mandalas are given to illustrate. One
experience
              is Jung's who arguably had a breakdown of schizophrenic
proportions.
              The other can be found in the life of John Nash, a
schizophrenic
              made famous by the recent film biography, &quot;A Beautiful
Mind.&quot;
              The presence of such hitherto undetected moments of
constructiveness
              during psychic distintegration prompts a reevaluation of
writers
              such as Kafka, who are commonly viewed as poets of
disintegration.
              His &quot;Description of a Struggle&quot; is a search for, and
temporary
              attainment of the healing center amidst such psychic
disintegration.

Having also experienced serious mental illness in several of my family
members, I would agree with Millie.  I'd also venture to say that there's
a Romantic glamorization of illness (poverty, disability, hardship in
general) involved in views such as those expressed by the article quoted
to begin.  Of course experience may teach one something, but to imagine
that something as disintegrative as serious mental illness is somehow
lightening or useful is probably not the case.

as someone wh has experienced serious mental illness i didn't think this
particular article minimized suffering or was romantic (Jung himself
possibly went through serious mental illness) although many 'literary' views
do have these characteristics as do many lay and professional views.

i found your description of your experiences quite interesting, by the way,
Millie.

I also agree with the point you are making, if I uderstand correctly  (email
is so prone to misunderstanding):  some people are able to create 'mandalas'
out of the signals we all get and some people create 'delusions'?

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

Mr. Big Stuff
Alan Lomax: Great White Hunter
or Thief, Plagiarist and Bigot?
by Dave Marsh
from www.counterpunch.org
Seeing Alan Lomax's obituary on the front page of the New York Times irked
the hell out of me. Harry Smith syndrome all over again----the Great White
"Discoverer" as the axis of cultural genesis. Lomax, wrote Jon Pareles,
"advocated what he called 'cultural equity: the right of every culture to
have equal time on the air and equal time in the classroom.'"
He did?
In 1993, when Lomax published The Land Where the Blues Began, his memoir of
blues research in the deep South, Peter Bochan invited him to do a WBAI
interview. Bochan ventured to Lomax that Elvis Presley stood as a great
product of the Southern folk cultures. Lomax firmly denied this, and said
that Bochan couldn't even know that Presley had listened as a boy to Sister
Rosetta Tharpe's gospel radio show because "You weren't there." He said
this so persistently and adamantly -- with all the stupid "folklorist"
purism that ruined the folk music revival--that Bochan went home and
intercut Lomax's prissy voice and dumb assertions with excerpts from Beavis
and Butthead. It aired that way.
Even sticking to the blues, Lomax cut a dubious figure. As a veteran blues
observer wrote me, "Don't get too caught up in grieving for Alan Lomax. For
every fine musical contribution that he made, there was an evil venal
manipulation of copyright, publishing and ownership of the collected material."
The most notorious concerns "Goodnight Irene." Lomax and his father
recorded Huddie "Leadbelly" Ledbetter's song first, so when the song needed
to be formally copyrighted because the Weavers were about to have a huge
hit with it, representatives of the Ledbetter family approached him. Lomax
agreed that this copyright should be established. He adamantly refused to
take his name off the song, or to surrender income from it, even though
Leadbelly's family was impoverished in the wake of his death two years earlier.
Lomax believed folk culture needed guidance from superior beings like
himself. Lomax told Bochan what he believed: nothing in poor people's
culture truly happened unless someone like him documented it. He hated
rock'n'roll--down to instigating the assault against Bob Dylan's sound
system at Newport in '65--because it had no need of mediation by experts
like himself.
The nature of the expert mattered, too. Lomax's obit made the front page
mainly because he "discovered" Son House and Muddy Waters. But in Can't Be
Satisfied, his new Muddy Waters biography, Robert Gordon shows that Lomax's
discoveries weren't the serendipitous events the great white hunter
portrayed. Lomax was led to House and then Waters by the great Negro
scholar, John Work III of Fisk University. Gordon even shows Lomax
plagiarizing Work, and not on a minor point. (See page 51) In his book,
Lomax offers precisely one sentence about Work. He eliminated Work from his
second Mississippi trip. He also burned Muddy Waters for the $20 he
promised for making the records.
Maybe the fact that Lomax served as a folk music "missionary" (to use Bob
Dylan's term) offsets all this. Provided that it doesn't turn out that
Lomax used and discarded ethnic workers worldwide the way he used Work, I
guess there's a case to be made. But I do hope that people understand that
when Pareles says that "Mr. Lomax wasn't interested in simply discovering
stars," part of the meaning is that he didn't want them to get in the way
of his self--importance.
Sometime soon, we need to figure out why it is that, when it comes to
cultures like those of Mississippi black people, we celebrate the milkman
more than the milk. Meanwhile, every sentence that will be uttered about
Lomax this week--including these--would be better used to describe the
great musicians he recorded in the U.S., the Bahamas, and elsewhere.
Reading Gordon's book serves as a good corrective.

              Stupid Burnout?

Anastasios,

Dave Marsh has spent his time on earth writing:

Born to Run: The Bruce Springsteen Story
Trapped: Michael Jackson and the Crossover Dream
Before I Get Old: The Story of the Who
Elvis
The Book of Rock Lists
Sun City: The Making of the Record
Glory Days: Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s
Louie Louie
Merry Christmas Baby: Holiday Music from Bing to Sting
The New Book of Rock Lists
The Great Rock'n'Roll Joke Book

Alan Lomax made thousands of recordings of people from all over the world
playing music never intended for the market. I've got a bunch of them. You
can borrow some if you actually believe from Marsh's axe-job that they're
ever going to sell more than a couple hundred or so copies of most of them.
Lomax would have made more money writing about Bruce Springsteen, The Who,
and Michael Jackson. Hell, he would have made more money writing about King
Crimson or Bread. Marsh's notion that Lomax stuck to recording folk music
from around the world because those people didn't become stars and that way
he could remain all-powerful is the most cynical thing I've read in a long
time. The only thing I can think when I read that is Wow: Marsh really
*does* assume his audience is actually that objectionably stupid. (He's
probably right.) He's also obviously jealous. I'm sure he imagined as a
youth he'd one day be as outrageously cool as Elvis was in his day, and here
he is, a 48-year-old man writing about Sting's holiday music.

The notion that Lomax fed off the people he recorded all over the globe is
simplistic. He was recording this stuff before it was lost by the culture
itself, which is often what happens as a culture begins to "absorb" Western
influences. Don't get me wrong: It's cool Asmahan could sing colluratura
when she wanted to.  And I do think the notion of "pure" folk is equally
simplistic. There's no such thing as "pure" in music, even folk music -- all
over the world it's all got elements (including instruments) borrowed from
other cultures. But there is a definite distinction (immediately gettable on
first hearing) between what Lomax was recording and where the musics of
various cultures were heading. A lot of that stuff is listenable now because
Lomax spent his life traveling around making these recordings. The cultures
themselves mostly weren't doing it. That music simply would have been
forgotten.

Marsh's piece on Alan Lomax is 100% hearsay (music biz gossip) by a man who
has, himself, made a living writing  forgettable crap about mostly overrated
white millionaires, usually well after they ceased being relevant enough for
anyone to really care from whom they stole what they sold.

(Tracy Ruggles)

A few years ago I spent quite a bit of time focusing on poetry that either
incorporates "found" writing or appears to. Eventually I noticed the close
relationship between this kind of writing and what I called "invented
languages." I was fascinated by Joan Retallack's -Errata suite- (Edge
Books,1993), which apparently incorporated errata slips as the ground or
basis for poetic texts. In my essay "The Aural Ellipsis and the Nature of
Listening In Contemporary Poetry"(in-Close Listening- Oxford UP,1998) I
employ Benjamin's concept of the aura as well as Winnicott's ideas about the
transitional object to try to bring into focus how found materials can exist
and function within the poem in an intermediate space between subjective and
objective experience.  I discuss that "the poetically sophisticated use of
found language by some of the most distinguished experimental contemporary
poets suggests that an important function of contemporary poetry is to
present readers and listeners with the sites and materials of the poem so as
to invite them to coparticipate in its creation. In this sense the writing
of contemporary poetry has a tendency to become a more and more
collaborative process...These texts point the way to telling us how poems
are created and how to listen closely to our responses in order to discover
the experiential sites  of the poem's constituent materials....The found
poem accentuates the physicality of the poem in both written and heard
forms. Hearing the aural ellipses within the poem of found or invented
language is also like discovering, by means of internal soundings, openings
In an otherwise impenetrable mass. Also, the found poem,like the  recent
scientific discovery that a meteorite uncovered long ago may contain
evidence of previous life on Mars, is a kind of proof that poetic life is
"out there," that it objectively exists and is embedded in everyday life. It
is a piece of evidence  that is also a site of language as poetry "in situ."
As in the case of the Martian meteorite, the section of found poetry  often
looks like and feels like a hefty "chunk" of the raw material from which the
poetic substance might be mined, in part by sounding out, by listening to
where the raw poetic element within the substance might exist. In that sense
the aural ellipsis is the place where the tuning of the mind to the poetic
wavelength might take place. And,in fact, for the time that your poetic
receiving "radio" remains on that wavelength it seems that it might emanate-
at least in small quantities- from many other proximate sites. As you look
out at the universe from the vantage point of the aural ellipsis it appears
that disparate elements available in many kind of places, times, and
categories might be placed in each other's proximity to see if a spark of
consciousness  across the gap might engender the sounds and flash of poetry.
By highlighting the possibilities of the poetic process within found
material,the poem also accentuates its potential for the listener to
experience it as a transitional object because the found material itself has
both subjective and objective aspects."

Must read: Edward Carey's OBSERVATORY MANSIONS
A quirky dark beautiful novel about obsession, fear, and found/stolen
objects -- the biography of objects, etc.
Beautiful.

I agree with Maxine Chernoff and Millie Niss -- and it's very hard to speak
about any of this without a deep recognition of the pain involved.  If only
the delusions were fun and not torment, then perhaps we could all
deliberately go mad.  LSD was an attempt -- very flawed.  There are, I'm
sure, biochemical connections between creativity and certain mental
illnesses -- but I'll leave that to the scientists to figure out.  I've
written about some aspects of this, in, I hope, a non-romantic way -- being
witness to schizophrenic and other mental anguish -- in "Satan's
Asshole."  A chapter is appearing in August's release of Jacket, if you're
interested.  Perhaps some analysis of mental illness (and poverty, etc.)
and glamor in relation to a universe of commodities and manipulation could
be useful.

On another matter: I have been very moved by the deaths of Philip Whalen
and Kenneth Koch but haven't added anything to the comments.  Both of them
did the remarkable thing of creating an entire world view.  When you read
their poems you enter an entire mode of thinking/speaking (and both are
very oral, both invoking witty play).  I was invited to join a memorial for
Kenneth in SF, but unfortunately I am going to be away, so I wrote a little
statement I'll share with you:

-----

Kenneth Koch conjured up a whole world view, a witty comic lyricism that
was also profound.  Reviewers liked to call his work "zany," but, really,
his poems and plays exalt pleasure and playfulness and laughter and
language -- not just an effect -- and in that way his writing created a new
mode for embracing the world by rearranging it.  He was the best teacher I
ever had, not just for poetry but for anything.  This was not just because
of his ingenuous techniques and infectious joy, but because he seduced me
into an entire outlook of comic insight and delight.  I am sure that right
now he is sitting around a table with other dead people -- the dead
people's writing workshop -- and he is getting them excited about writing
about the pleasures of death.

I wrote an essay/memoir (an adaptation from my own in progress memoir but it
is a stand-alone piece) on this subject (of schizophrenia), but it is an
extended character sketch of my then boyfriend.  At the time he was willing
for me to publish the essay and other stuff which revealed private parts of
his life.  But now that he has dumped me, I doubt he'd be happy if I
distribute the work.  But I don't want to just throuw it away.  And I
certainly can't get rid of all the memoir chapters he's in-- it's just a
fact that he was a major part of my life in the years i was writing about.

My questions are

1) is it legal to publish this essay (say on the web) without his permission
(I don't even know how to cotact him)
2) would he have grounds for a civil procedure of invasion of provacy
against me?
3) is it the kind of thing only a shmuck would ever do?  (actually the essay
is pretty admireing of him, I mean I was in love with him when I wrote it
and he has a lot of good qualiities besides being totally nuts...)

I hope I can publish it because I worked hard on it.  I had a go ahead from
_Harper's_ but then they didn't take the finished story (argh), but I had
never gotten that close before to a major magazine.

Dear all,

I would greatly appreciate any pointers re. any present-day =

Many thanks in advance!

Hi Holly

'improvising found punctuation with the audience' sounds fascinating. Can
you say a little more  -  either f/c/ or b//c about the work??

really keen to know more

love and love

<DIV></DIV>&gt;Subject: Dave Marsh: Auto-Irrelevant Former Hipster or Just Plain Mean Stupid Burnout?
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Date: Mon, 22 Jul 2002 01:52:28 -0400
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Anastasios,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Dave Marsh has spent his time on earth writing:
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Born to Run: The Bruce Springsteen Story
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Trapped: Michael Jackson and the Crossover Dream
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Before I Get Old: The Story of the Who
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Elvis
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The Book of Rock Lists
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Sun City: The Making of the Record
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Glory Days: Bruce Springsteen in the 1980s
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Louie Louie
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Merry Christmas Baby: Holiday Music from Bing to Sting
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The New Book of Rock Lists
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The Great Rock'n'Roll Joke Book
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Alan Lomax made thousands of recordings of people from all over the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;world
<DIV></DIV>&gt;playing music never intended for the market. I've got a bunch of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;them. You
<DIV></DIV>&gt;can borrow some if you actually believe from Marsh's axe-job that
<DIV></DIV>&gt;they're
<DIV></DIV>&gt;ever going to sell more than a couple hundred or so copies of most
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of them.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Lomax would have made more money writing about Bruce Springsteen,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The Who,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and Michael Jackson. Hell, he would have made more money writing
<DIV></DIV>&gt;about King
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Crimson or Bread. Marsh's notion that Lomax stuck to recording folk
<DIV></DIV>&gt;music
<DIV></DIV>&gt;from around the world because those people didn't become stars and
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that way
<DIV></DIV>&gt;he could remain all-powerful is the most cynical thing I've read in
<DIV></DIV>&gt;a long
<DIV></DIV>&gt;time. The only thing I can think when I read that is Wow: Marsh
<DIV></DIV>&gt;really
<DIV></DIV>&gt;*does* assume his audience is actually that objectionably stupid.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;(He's
<DIV></DIV>&gt;probably right.) He's also obviously jealous. I'm sure he imagined
<DIV></DIV>&gt;as a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;youth he'd one day be as outrageously cool as Elvis was in his day,
<DIV></DIV>&gt;and here
<DIV></DIV>&gt;he is, a 48-year-old man writing about Sting's holiday music.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;The notion that Lomax fed off the people he recorded all over the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;globe is
<DIV></DIV>&gt;simplistic. He was recording this stuff before it was lost by the
<DIV></DIV>&gt;culture
<DIV></DIV>&gt;itself, which is often what happens as a culture begins to "absorb"
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Western
<DIV></DIV>&gt;influences. Don't get me wrong: It's cool Asmahan could sing
<DIV></DIV>&gt;colluratura
<DIV></DIV>&gt;when she wanted to. And I do think the notion of "pure" folk is
<DIV></DIV>&gt;equally
<DIV></DIV>&gt;simplistic. There's no such thing as "pure" in music, even folk
<DIV></DIV>&gt;music -- all
<DIV></DIV>&gt;over the world it's all got elements (including instruments)
<DIV></DIV>&gt;borrowed from
<DIV></DIV>&gt;other cultures. But there is a definite distinction (immediately
<DIV></DIV>&gt;gettable on
<DIV></DIV>&gt;first hearing) between what Lomax was recording and where the musics
<DIV></DIV>&gt;of
<DIV></DIV>&gt;various cultures were heading. A lot of that stuff is listenable now
<DIV></DIV>&gt;because
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Lomax spent his life traveling around making these recordings. The
<DIV></DIV>&gt;cultures
<DIV></DIV>&gt;themselves mostly weren't doing it. That music simply would have
<DIV></DIV>&gt;been
<DIV></DIV>&gt;forgotten.
<DIV></DIV>&gt;
<DIV></DIV>&gt;Marsh's piece on Alan Lomax is 100% hearsay (music biz gossip) by a
<DIV></DIV>&gt;man who
<DIV></DIV>&gt;has, himself, made a living writing forgettable crap about mostly
<DIV></DIV>&gt;overrated
<DIV></DIV>&gt;white millionaires, usually well after they ceased being relevant
<DIV></DIV>&gt;enough for
<DIV></DIV>&gt;anyone to really care from whom they stole what they sold.

Also, Roland Barthes.
Then there's  Julia Kristeva,
'Revolution In Poetic Language'
among other works.
Of course Jacques Derrida
hits upon many poetic topics.

People interested in TextArc (http://textarc.org):

It's (and I'm) at SIGGRAPH '02 today, tomorrow, and through Friday.
Thanks to overly generous support from the  SIGGRAPH Art Show (where I'm
a "working artist"--actually printing and tweaking the work based on
attendee feedback), Roland (who loaned a gorgeous 8 ink 55" printer and
donated supplies), and SMART Tectnologies (who loaned 2 50" plasma
display touch screens).

Come see me if you're near San Antonio!

Here's what the booth looks like late Monday, after the first whole day:
http://textarc.org/appearances/SIGGRAPH02/mondayEvening.jpg

And I've released a new version of TextArc, available under the link
that says "Thousands of Texts" at http://textarc.org. There's a not
complete, nor fully documented major feature (word pairs) that you can
tinker with at the lower left corner of the screen. And a few more
changes--I'll detail them soon at the site.

Thanks for the interest and support!

Brad

Subject:      Found - collaborative magnetism
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Nick, I appreciate the reference to your exploration
of found poetry of a few years ago. The magnetic field
that is created by this process is one that continues
to fascinate me, largely because of the wealth of
possibilities in attitude, positioning, and so forth.
You cite a very positive and growth-inducing approach,
wherein the collaborative magnetism can be enhanced
through recognition and acknowledgement of the
initiating object.

I'm interested in a proposed neutrality of the
original/initiating object and its perceived
evolutionary passages, and equally in what might
hypothetically become an aggressive act of
repositioning the original. Magnetic fields are
created by actively repositioning the sphere of
notice.

Just another observation: there seems a kind of life
cycle to the use of found elements in writing. Early
on, there seems an abundance of richness. This may be
in part due to the courtship of early discovery.
Later, as surprise comes to be replaced by at least a
sprinkle of expectation, a waning may take place.

This may apply especially to simple "found"
engagements. Adding complexity, inviting layers of
field, may enhance successive episodes.

Routledge published a series of books beginning in the early 1990s along
with the Philosophy Department of the University of Warwick (UK) called
"Studies in Philosophy and Literature."  It has a Continentalist bent.
David Wood from that department wrote a book called _Philosophers' Poets_ in
the series.  The University has a "Centre for Research in Philosophy and
Literature" either in or affiliated with the Philosophy department.

Dear all,

I would greatly appreciate any pointers re. any present-day =
English-language philosophers who are interested in and/or have written =
about poetry past or present. By philosophers I mean people whose =
primary professional interests like in philosophy rather than =
literature.

Also of great interest would be information about any university courses =
anywhere in the English-speaking world that combine poetry and =
philosophy.

Many thanks in advance!

Brendan Lorber asked me to forward this to the list for him -- it was being
bounced back when he tried ... --Gary

One easy, gratuitous, reductionist way to mark the passing of Alan Lomax is
to rip him to shreds. He was attacked in the 50's for his leftist politics &
in the 60's for his work on cantometrics -- so this isn't the first time
someone's attempted to make him the victim of their own self-aggrandizing
agenda.

Another, perhaps more valuable response would be to actually listen to the
music & interviews that he recorded over the course of decades of work &
consider how lucky we are that only 90% of the world's music is now dictated
by Sony. Whether you believe "we celebrate the milkman more than the milk",
the world remains pretty lactose intolerant. Lomax went to great lengths in
his effort to combat the racist, classist monoculture.

An even better reaction to his death might be to slip some money to the
musicians themselves.  Despite Marsh's outrageous claims to the contrary,
making sure musicians got the money & the credit due them was & is, central
to Lomax's mission.

Or am I mistaken?

The site for the Association for Cultural Equity says:

The family suggests that contributions be made to:
The Blues Music Foundation for the Willie Moore Fund
c/o Experience Music Project
2901 3rd Ave
Seattle, WA 98121

Once you've done that, put on one of the albums that you'd never have heard
of were it not for the work Lomax did, file away Marsh's screed as just an
addendum to his seminal opus "The Great Rock'n'Roll Joke Book" & then, if
you want, hit www.alan-lomax.com to contextualize it all.

to whom it may concern:

1. I'm moving, my new address is:
Jessica Smith
77 Linwood Ave. #6
Buffalo NY 14209

2. NAME magazine orders, submissions, fan mail (?) etc. can be sent c/o the
above address.

For those of you who've sent stuff for name-- we won't be reviewing
submissions till September, so it may be October before we contact you
about your poems.  We do prefer to showcase the talents of not young but
pre-natal poets--we typically accept between 10 and 20% of submissions,
most from poets under 25 (and we're planning to be even more frugal with
acceptances this issue).  And we're very partial to experimental work.  If
you're a younger poet planning to submit, it's advisable to check out an
older issue.

If you prefer to be in more substantial company, the following university
at buffalo publications also accept unsolicited submissions:

Kiosk
-- 1st issue includes the likes of Bernstein, Perloff, Rothenberg,
McCaffery, and younger poets such as Donovan, Magee, Gallagher, & Durgin

Ecopoetics (this is themed so watch your content)
-- 1st issue includes Grenier, Spahr, Skinner, Bettridge, et. al.

Could someone define what "romanticization" means here?  Inappropriate
appropriation?  I don't see why reading the signs of mental illness is
that different than portraying extreme human experience (death,
childbirth, homelessness) in general.  I am dubious about the claims being
made in the article, but I don't see why mental illness can't be discussed
by those who aren't mentally ill.  And I think this is what the claim that
mental illness shouldn't be "romanticized" boils down, too.  In other
words, it is simply your basic claim against theory,

Sontag's book on "Illness as a Metaphor" was not about "romanticizing"
aids, but the inevitable way in which certain prominent disorders becomes
metaphors for experience of the general population.  People talked about
societies as "schizophrenic" in a loose way because it was compelling
metaphor, not because there could be a point-by-point comparison between
the experience of schizophrenia for an individual and the experience of
society.  This metaphor was also licensed because early theories of
schizophrenia suggested that its origin was social.  Gregory Bateson wrote
of "schizogenetic" societies (and there is data that shows the disorder
varies according to national borders).  RD Laing's work is clearly in this
tradition, as was Felix Guattari's.  So in a certain sense when these
writers glorified schizophrenia as a form of "truth" about society, it was
because schizophrenia was thought to be less hypocritical response to
society than neurosis.  They certainly did not mean to minimize the pain
of invidual sufferers or to glamorize it.  It was their take on society in
general that was dire.

In any case, I don't think that these metaphors are very prevalent.
There is certain datedness to the argument that hallucinations (whether
organic or artificial in origin) reveal some truth about society.  So a
further point about illnesses as a metaphor is that they shift.  Twenty
years ago, we thought we were all schizophrenic.  Today, the prevailing
disease seems to be obsessive-compulsiveness.  A few years ago, it would
have been eating disorders.  The difference is that while schizophrenics
can seem like prophets or seers, these sufferers are clearly victims.
There was a certain optimism to the schizophrenic society argument that is
absent from current ones.

It is interesting that when war comes the avant-garde breaks down, as if the
emergency of the moment is too real to hold pure experimentations together.
So, I suggest, like in physics, what is needed is an experimental language
that proves itself in a larger than academic world. In either case, your
review focused some issues. Thank you!

Hi Anastasios,

I'm all for balance, especially w/respect to the venerated. So, okay.

This will take some time, but let's see what Marsh actually has to offer:

In the first paragraph containing factual (anecdotal) evidence, Marsh
writes: "In 1993, when Lomax published The Land Where the Blues Began, his
memoir of blues research in the deep South, Peter Bochan invited him to do a
WBAI interview. Bochan ventured to Lomax that Elvis Presley stood as a great
product of the Southern folk cultures. Lomax firmly denied this, and said
that Bochan couldn't even know that Presley had listened as a boy to Sister
Rosetta Tharpe's gospel radio show because "You weren't there." He said this
so persistently and adamantly -- with all the stupid "folklorist" purism
that ruined the folk music revival--that Bochan went home and intercut
Lomax's prissy voice and dumb assertions with excerpts from Beavis and
Butthead. It aired that way."

Forgetting for a moment slanted phrases like "stupid 'folklorist' purism"
"prissy voice" and "dumb assertions" (this is "balanced" journalism?) --
what is Marsh's source for this?

He doesn't say. We assume then, it's that recording, with the Beavis and
Butthead excerpts. Either that, or Bochan himself.

In other words, Marsh's only evidence for this "fact" about Lomax is a sound
recording made by an interviewer who has grotesquely manipulated it and then
broadcast it with the sole intention of making a man he's just had an
argument with look bad.

This is evidence only that Bochan is an unethical broadcaster. Even if Marsh
got the story from Bochan himself, who would trust a guy who'd do that? My
sense, reading the above anecdote, is that the two clashed, as people
sometimes do, and that Bochan used what power he had as a radio person to
make Lomax look bad. It doesn't say much for Bochan's character.

The next paragraph: "As a veteran blues observer wrote me, "Don't get too
caught up in grieving for Alan Lomax. For every fine musical contribution
that he made, there was an evil venal manipulation of copyright, publishing
and ownership of the collected material."

"A veteran blues observer." What does that mean? No name is mentioned.
Worse, note that there is not a single factual event even mentioned in said
"veteran's" condemnation. Yet Marsh feels justified trotting this out as
evidence.

The next paragraph is where Marsh supposedly delivers the goods:

Marsh: "The most notorious concerns "Goodnight Irene." Lomax and his father
recorded Huddie "Leadbelly" Ledbetter's song first, so when the song needed
to be formally copyrighted because the Weavers were about to have a huge hit
with it, representatives of the Ledbetter family approached him. Lomax
agreed that this copyright should be established. He adamantly refused to
take his name off the song, or to surrender income from it, even though
Leadbelly's family was impoverished in the wake of his death two years
earlier."

There's a serious problem with the above paragraph.

Alan Lomax's name is *not* on the copyright.

It's Alan's father, John Lomax.

Here's another version of the story: In "The Life and Legend of Leadbelly",
authors Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell claim that Leadbelly didn't really
write a song that got him a pardon from prison as was legend, and that
"Goodnight Irene" is based on a Gussie Davis song from 1892. When John Lomax
toured Leadbelly (Alan was simply working for his father), a NY promoter
worried about Leadbelly's time in prison ... and decided instead of hiding
it to make the most of it -- he got Leadbelly and John Lomax to agree to
have Leadbelly dress in prison clothes, to help puff up the myth.

John Lomax. Not Alan Lomax.

So, what Marsh here has done is (a) substitute Alan's father for Alan and
(b) tell only a fraction of the story -- if, indeed, the fraction he's
telling has any legitimacy whatsoever. He cites it as "notorious." I'm
assuming that means it's been documented somewhere, as Marsh has described
it? What I've quoted above may not be accurate either. But at least I'm
documenting a published account. It's more than Marsh has done here.

Marsh again: "Lomax believed folk culture needed guidance from superior
beings like himself."

No documentation whatsoever to support this.

Marsh: "Lomax told Bochan what he believed: nothing in poor people's culture
truly happened unless someone like him documented it."

Lomax said this? Where? On that tape? The one Bochan manipulated with Beavis
and Butthead excerpts? I don't believe Lomax ever made such a statement.

More Marsh: "He hated rock'n'roll--down to instigating the assault against
Bob Dylan's sound system at Newport in '65--because it had no need of
mediation by experts like himself."

Aldon reported something similar -- I guess this is on film, and I'm not
going to dispute it, although I've never personally seen it. One point for
Marsh. Hardly evidence of Lomax as "fraud," "thief" or "plagiarist" -- the
primary charges Marsh makes -- the reason, supposedly, we're reading his
essay.

Marsh: "The nature of the expert mattered, too. Lomax's obit made the front
page mainly because he "discovered" Son House and Muddy Waters."

A guy who "discovers" two singers isn't going to make the cover of the
Times, otherwise there'd be a guy or gal like that on the cover every couple
months or so. Lomax is there because he did many interesting things with his
life -- some of which had profound repercussions in this and other cultures.
I'd say he's there because of a general paradigm shift -- people in the U.S.
becoming (at least somewhat) more aware of multiculturalist takes on
culture. (And I think that's partially what "irks" (read: frightens) Marsh,
actually -- but, that's just a belief on my part.)

Marsh again: "But in Can't Be Satisfied, his new Muddy Waters biography,
Robert Gordon shows that Lomax's discoveries weren't the serendipitous
events the great white hunter portrayed."

Lomax portrayed these discoveries as serendipitous events ... where? Marsh
doesn't say. Again, no evidence is offered. Neither is any evidence offered
for Gordon's having "showed us" this. It's just stated.

Marsh: "Lomax was led to House and then Waters by the great Negro scholar,
John Work III of Fisk University. Gordon even shows Lomax plagiarizing Work,
and not on a minor point. (See page 51)"

There's no evidence in either of those two sentences above to support the
claims made. John Work III was an academic enthomusicologist and a composer.
He may very well have led Lomax to both blues men. I'm assuming that people
led Lomax to everyone Lomax recorded, and that he didn't just parachute down
randomly with a 500-pound recording device. How else would he find all of
these people?

The second assertion, about plagiarizing Work, "not on a minor point," is
unsubstantiated. There's a page number to look up. (If someone finds this,
please post it.) We can't evaluate it in the article itself -- it's
(conveniently?) missing.

Marsh again: "In his book, Lomax offers precisely one sentence about Work.
He eliminated Work from his second Mississippi trip."

Work is the guy everyone was expected to go through to meet all of the blues
singers in the south? This is just weird. Lomax is expected to publish in
his book long descriptions of all of the hundreds, possibly thousands, of
people who lead him to people playing folk and indigenous music? That's like
asking Marsh to publish long descriptions of all of the djs and radio
stations where he first heard the 1000 rock and soul songs he wrote his book
about. It doesn't make sense.

Marsh: "He also burned Muddy Waters for the $20 he promised for making the
records."

What's the source for this? Again, like most of the above, it's just stated
without evidence.

And that's it. Those are all of the purported "facts" in Marsh's essay I was
able to dig out.

The rest of it is just slanted words and phrases like "thief," "bigot,"
"hunter," "Harry Smith syndrome" (!!), "prissy," "stupid," and on and on, a
stream of vitriol, none of it substantiated in any way whatsoever.

I don't hate Marsh. But this isn't my idea of an honest attempt to "balance"
the hagiography. That would require someone with some factual information
sharing it. Preferably without a bunch of name-calling in every paragraph.

As of this writing, the counterpunch.org site's link to Marsh's essay says:
"Mr. Big Stuff: Alan Lomax, Great White Fraud."

I've tried writing this without letting anger get the best of me. Let me
know, Anastasios, if I'm being unfair in pointing out that Marsh's piece is
not only vicious, but in all likelihood untrue.

In a roundabout way I think the review highlights a crucial cultural
watershed and the importance of Khlebnikov's process or 'with' response to
the hAZArds of life.  Your response here, Joel, led me to thinking about a
contemporary process approach at the time by Trotsky whonot only got
swallowed by what he helped set in motion was also and perhaps more
significantly anti-experimentalism as not utilitarian.  Perhaps then as now
it is the resistance to experimentation or process that culminates in
either/or, us/them ways of seeing and thinking that have no tolerance for
poetic p[rocess?

why not ask some experimental artists in the third world what they think
rather than talking about them?  I am going to ask Clemente Padin if he has
any input.

recent discussions here and on another list have prompted me to offer a workhop on putting it together agian experimentally:

Tell iT sLANT




Week 1. Readings and discussion. Yes, you have to read something! I will provide a list of 5 or 6 readings and each participant is asked to suggest a book or article.

Week 2. Report to the group the method you have selected for 'slanting' your writing.

Week 3. Provide a sample of your work in progress. Submit and accept criticism. If participants have had trouble getting started, there will be an [WARNING!] EXERCISE.

Week 4. Discussion of problems getting started, thoughts on relation of the process to theoretical readings from week 1, and any problems with group cohesion, atmosphere, support, etc.

Week 5. Second work sample or [WARNING!] EXERCISE/

Week 6. Conclusion and exchange of thoughts on where to submit your work for consideration.

-----

cost will be $60.  This is not a fancy telecourse thing, just email exchange, but you do get group support.  course will start when I hear from 8 people.

My initial ref. was not so much to the Dylan sound system episode, about which there is much dispute, as to the Lomax/Grossman wrestling match, which has been well documented from all sides -- I also ref'd Lomax's uncomprehening response to Dylan's performance at Newport, stands whether or not you choose to believe that Lomax went nuts at the performance itself.

CAN'T BE SATISFIED, by Robert Gordon, narrates the Lomax/Work/Waters encounters in chapter 3, and includes a photo of one of the four letters Waters dictated and mailed to Lmax seeking the promised payment and "contributor's copy"  (sound familiar, poets?) - - I think the record makes it clear that Gordon is correct when he argues that "Lomax virtually erased the scholarship of John Work" (51) -- People familiar with the histories of African American music and of AFrican AMerican scholars have known these stories for decades --

We need neither hagiographies nor trashings -- we do need to recognize that the same Lomax who ripped people off also opened doors and brought wider attention to deserving musicians -- I think it was that bittersweet sort of realization that motivated Dylan's stage acknowledgement of Lomax that one day in Virginia --

Lomax did much good & much wrong -- we need to understand all of it together --

I like a lot of what Corbett is saying in his post "language" but I
think his simple typo will confuse some of those who aren't familiar
with Susan Sontag's writing . . .  It's just a slip of the pen
(keyboard) in which he conflates Sontag's 1979 book ILLNESS AS
METAPHOR with her much later book on AIDS (AIDS AND ITS METAPHORS)--

Obviously the "Illness as Metaphor" book came too early to deal with
AIDS.  It was a groundbreaking book in its day due to its startling
thesis--that disease is not a metaphor, nor a punishment, that it's
just something that happens to the  body, and that despite the
overwhelming urge to use illness as a description of something else
(often a zeitgeist--Sontag shows that TB, or consumption, was popular
earlier in the 20th century as a convenient descriptive, allusive
shorthand for current problems--think of "The Magic Mountain"--while
by century's end cancer had become the "disease of choice" among
litterateurs anxious to describe the social, moral, political
conditions in which they found themselves.)

"AIDS and Its Metaphors" is a markedly inferior book of little value,
you get the idea she was just re-treading everything she had said in
the first book, except eerily enough she sometimes winds up
suggesting that AIDS is a different order of disease than, say,
cancer and yes, indeed, it may therefore be used as a metaphor,
and/or may with propriety breed the sorts of metaphors attached to
it, which she had so firmly ruled out earlier.  However from what I
understand she donated all the money she made from this book to AIDS
relief and activist efforts, so that's as they say all good.
Otherwise a horrid disappointment and a time waster par excellence.

Millie--

I've published about a dozen personal essays/memoirs drawing on my own life
and incidentally on the lives of people I knew.  I have friends working on
the same kind of thing who've run up against the question you have.  Also,
I'm a lawyer and I've done some First Amendment work.  So here's my
perspective.

Try changing non-essential details (and using a different first name for the
boyfriend, natch) so that the boyfriend isn't easily identifiable.  You
should do this because it's the right thing to do, but it's also the legally
safer thing to do.  Of course, you need to keep the essential details (an
artistic judgment, in the end) so that your writing has grit and truth.

Even if your portrait of someone is favorable in your eyes and in most
readers' eyes, the someone could still be offended.  The other side of this
is that some seemingly unfavorable portraits don't bother the subject at
all--I read somewhere that the mother in *The Liar's Club,* a very raw
family memoir published a few years ago (blanking on the author's name)
loved the book (even though it shows her ignoring sexual molestation of her
daughter, going crazy and piling the family furniture in a bonfire, etc.)
So you never know how the people you write about will react.

The best discussion of this ethical dilemma I've read is in Philip Gerard's
*Creative Nonfiction,* especially pages 150-53, "The Confidence of Family
and Friends" and nearby pages.  He suggests that you show each piece to the
people you're writing about.  The dangers are obvious, including their
making unreasonable objections and your making things worse if you publish
over their objections.  But they could also make suggestions that strengthen
the piece.  It's a tough call, and you say you don't know how to contact the
boyfriend, so it may be impossible anyway.

Speaking as a lawyer, I can only point out that anybody can sue anyone
anytime over anything.  For a libel suit to succeed, the subject has to be
identifiable (that's why I suggest changing details), the statements have to
be disparaging and untrue, etc.  Your boyfriend isn't a public figure (I
assume); there are special rules making it harder for them to sue.  But
there are also new and creative bases for suit, like invasion of privacy and
placement in a disparaging light, etc., etc.  Inertia is your best
protection:  it's unlikely your boyfriend would see the piece, it's unlikely
he'd be upset enough and have the energy to sue, a lawyer wouldn't see you
as a rich enough defendant to be worth suing on contingency, etc.

If it were me, I'd go ahead and revise the piece for publication and send it
out.  If you need to tell this story and can tell it with force and style,
people will want to read it and it will be worth any risks there are.  Good
luck!

Celebrating the Vision of Merce Cunningham

July 24, 2002
By JENNIFER DUNNING






Merce Cunningham can no longer move as easily as he once
did. At 83, stricken worse than most with the dancer's
curse of arthritis, he has trouble walking. Adjusting to
this setback, he has revisited a dance form he knew as a
child. "In airports, I have to be pushed around in a
wheelchair because it's 10 miles to anywhere, so you have
to sit around a lot," Mr. Cunningham said. "So I've
realized I could go back to tap-dancing in a wheelchair.
It's marvelous! I've relearned the waltz clog. I'm not too
good yet on the time step."

For all his reputation as a master producer of impenetrably
difficult modern dance, Mr. Cunningham's long voyage
through the art of dance has been surprisingly simple. At
heart, this journey of six decades has been a matter of
"how adroitly you get one foot to the next," as he
describes his notion of rhythm. "Something starts you
thinking about other possibilities," Mr. Cunningham said in
a recent interview at his West Village studio. "Because
there always are. There always are."

That is what has kept him going. "I like dancing," he said
softly. "It's very simple. Probably to most people it's
absurd. But I really think dancing is wonderful. I can't do
it. But I still enjoy the possibility of finding ways,
finding out something else about it."

A private man whom everyone calls Merce, Mr. Cunningham
collaborated with the composer John Cage, who died in 1992,
on work that has expanded the ways artists and audiences
think about dance and even movement itself. Like George
Balanchine, Mr. Cunningham has made it hard to rely
comfortably on the precepts of the past or to shy away from
the advances of the future.

The step-to-step progress of his life's work will be hinted
at this week in the Lincoln Center Festival's 50 Years of
Forward Motion, a two-program retrospective that celebrates
the Cunningham company's 50th anniversary, opening tonight
and closing on Saturday night at the New York State
Theater. The engagement begins a year of 50th-anniversary
projects worldwide that include a free performance on Sept.
3 at Battery Park City and the publication of "Other
Animals," a book of several decades of animal and plant
sketches by Mr. Cunningham.

His response to relative immobility is a perfect example of
how throughout his career Mr. Cunningham has used whatever
was at hand to move into new territory, even
computer-assisted choreography, though he readily admits he
is confounded by the simplest technology. He can no longer
wade into the crowd in rehearsals to demonstrate new
passages of choreography, but that has not stopped him from
creating new dances. And while he was overseeing the
reconstruction of revivals for the festival repertory -
which is to include a premiere, "Loose Time," that explores
rhythm - Mr. Cunningham was at work on a premiere for a
London season in September. He has continued his dancer's
lifelong routine of giving himself a daily private warm-up
at the ballet barre, moving just his feet. He accompanies
his students at the barre in the classes that he teaches
several times a week. "Just so I will do something," he
explained. His attentiveness has been reciprocated. It was
Robert Swinston, a longtime Cunningham dancer and recoverer
of lost Cunningham works, who talked him into reading the
text onstage in the festival revival of "How to Pass, Kick,
Fall and Run." Another dancer, Jeannie Steele, has been
helping Mr. Cunningham with his tap.

"Jeannie's grandma was in the Rockettes, so she knows the
time step, and she shows me every once in a while," he
said. "But somehow I don't connect it. I knew it from Mrs.
Barrett. But the waltz clog I got back."

Maude Barrett was the first dance teacher of Mercier Philip
Cunningham, who began studying tap with her in his early
teens in Centralia, Wash., the small town where he was
born. He was fascinated by vaudeville performances that his
parents took him to, and his fate was sealed by a recital
performance by Mrs. Barrett, dressed in yellow, swinging
juggling clubs and then walking on her hands while talking
to the audience. The stage, he knew, was where he wanted to
be. At home he played jazz piano. In grange halls and
auditoriums he cut a dapper figure performing in ballroom
and tap routines at town events with Mrs. Barrett's
daughter, Marjorie.

Formal theater and dance studies followed at the Cornish
School of Fine Arts in Seattle, where he met Cage, who was
playing piano for classes and teaching at that school and
who was to become Mr. Cunningham's professional and
personal life partner. The young Mr. Cunningham and "three
ladies from the music department" also performed in Cage's
percussion ensemble, Mr. Cunningham recalled, nervously
attacking scores by modernists like Henry Cowell and Lou
Harrison.

"After one rehearsal, John said to one of the music
teachers, `You're playing everything just absolutely
perfect,' " Mr. Cunningham recalled, laughing. " `Now go a
little further and make a few mistakes.' He was very
meticulous about your doing it right. But then you go
forward."

Mr. Cunningham went on to study dance one summer at Mills
College in Oakland, Calif., where a member of the Martha
Graham company noticed the blend of lyrical buoyancy,
sensuality and clarity of shape and rhythm that even then
defined Mr. Cunningham as a dancer and urged Graham to grab
him for her troupe. Mr. Cunningham quickly made a name for
himself as a Graham dancer. Cage, who had also come East,
encouraged him to move away from Graham to create his own
dances.

He presented his first program in 1944 at the
Humphrey-Weidman Studio Theater on West 16th Street in
Manhattan. Less than a decade later, in 1953, the offer of
a summer residence at Black Mountain College in North
Carolina led to the formation of Mr. Cunningham's company.
A core of dancers that he had been working with came with
him to that now-famous incubator of avant-garde arts, among
them a stripling named Paul Taylor and Carolyn Brown, who
is now celebrated as the definitive Cunningham dancer.

It would take another decade for the dancers, who
crisscrossed the United States in a Volkswagen bus, to be
paid at least meager professional wages. That came about
because of the company's triumphant first European tour, in
1964. The tour would have confirmed his belief in the value
of his work, if he had needed confirmation. "See, we had
played here, but very little," he said, referring to
performances in the United States. "And then we went abroad
and played to so many different publics. All of them did
not necessarily like it, by any means, but all of them gave
us the sense that they were interested in what they saw and
what they heard, in some way or another. So we didn't have
to think that we always had to put up a battle."

Winning the acceptance - or at least the interest - of
American audiences has not become much easier over the
years, despite Mr. Cunningham's fame. One difficulty has
been his use of abstruse-seeming chance procedures as a
central creative device, which gave his work the randomness
of a throw of the dice. "Suite for Five," a Cunningham
classic from the 1950's that is to be performed this week,
was choreographed this way.

"Suite for Five" is one of his most beautiful works, a
complex, fluid distillation of time and space. It is also
considered one of his most accessible pieces. Its score, by
Cage, is not typical of the noisy music that used to send
Mr. Cunningham's audiences racing for the exits. And there
are a few recognizable ballet steps and poses to cling to.

Asked about those traces of ballet, Mr. Cunningham
laughed. "If someone puts her leg back behind her and it's
straight, they say it's an arabesque," he said wryly. "I
don't object, because of course it is. My idea always has
been that I want to use as much movement as I can make
possible."

Chance compositional methods can range from consulting the
ancient Chinese book of divination, the I Ching, to
determining elements of a dance by tracing the
imperfections of a piece of paper. "Cunningham uses chance
much as he might use a magnet, to draw possibilities to him
from beyond his reach, and to arrange his materials, like
iron filings, into relationships he might not otherwise
have seen," James Klosty, an early chronicler of the
Cunningham company, wrote in his 1975 book, "Merce
Cunningham." The completed choreography is set, preserved
through performance, notes and video. It was Mr.
Cunningham's vision, Mr. Klosty wrote, to reconcile
precision and the unpredictable.

Ordinary mortals tend to have problems understanding ideas
like this. It is not much easier to grasp the concept of
giving independence to collaborating composers and
designers, whose contributions tend to be introduced at the
first performance.

Mr. Cunningham has an answer for those who worry about
misunderstanding: dance gives one nothing concrete in
return, to paraphrase one of his most famous comments, only
the pleasure of doing and seeing it. His dances are like
small and large worlds whose mysterious daily events unfold
in real time on the stage, with the viewer welcome to enter
and explore without a map. But that kind of freedom can
also be unnerving.

"I don't have any idea how this kind of audience will look
at, say, `Suite for Five,' " Mr. Cunningham said of the
festival pieces. "But they can look at them for what they
are, because the dances are made without intention, that
is, without saying this is about this. We present them, and
present them as well as we can. But we don't try to give
people any idea how they might feel about it. So of course
many people get lost, or say they don't understand, or
whatever. I feel they're missing a kind of experience that
isn't all about dancing by any means."

One of his favorite memories is of an early
lecture-demonstration that he, Cage and the company
presented at a Midwestern concert. "There was one man in
the audience who asked very interesting questions, but in
an irritated manner," Mr. Cunningham recalled. "And John
answered, as he always does, and he was extraordinary.
Finally, this man sighed and said: `Well, I'm so glad they
brought you. Ordinarily, they bring us things like piano
concerts and all we are is entertained.' "

I like Yunte's review muchly, but I hardly see how it or the books under
review support the claim that the avante-garde breaks down at the time of
war.  I would also question uncritically reiterating that the current
events constitute a "war" for the US.  Doing so helps legitimate the
actions against civil liberties and shifts in spending priorities--as well
as gives Bush II the drama he was craving (the better to distract you, my
dear)..  And I don't know what is supposed to be meant by "in physics"?
_What_ in physics?  The grand unified theory?  Strings?  I am not psychic
enough to know what is intended.  Finally, if the preeminent modality of
the avante-garde, from Stein to Silliman in Perloff's argument, is
disjunction, then I can easily any number of pop culture documents that
begged, borrowed and stolen these methods.  LP and NYS are simply more
rarefied and elegant versions of what is the contemporary tongue, at least
outside family newspapers, newsweeklies, Hollywood film, and network TV.
And the academy is pretty resistant to disjunction:  it took Williams
forever to get into the canon, Stein even longer, and Djuna Barnes got
there maybe five years ago.

Oof.  I really appreciate the review and the link to it.

Robert

on
sex.


everything turns to liquid; everything flows, cauterizes. the corrosive
effect on the lip. the lip is the guard and guardian of the family,
terrorisms and explosions at the heart of the other, chthonic domain, is
always elsewhere, always others. we are blind beneath the surface; we
carry atmosphere with us, refusing union. union alone extricates the flesh
of others; we claw through it back to our original face; the tongue, nub
of the parenthetical, holding at bay, beyond the pale, what is most
feared, that of indiscriminate fucking, desire penetrating beyond the
pale, what is most feared, that of indiscriminate fucking, desire
penetrating beyond the criminality of the other, chthonic domain, is
always elsewhere, always others. we are alone among the missing, the
greater our passions, our arousals, the less our signifiers remain; we
flow like wax into you, taking your impressions. it's politics. it
transforms into the fantasm of an originary state. sex is a foundation,
originary impulse; only that it retro-projects into the fantasm, withdraws
from the nub re-enters the nub; what the nub is the same against the same;
the nub re-enters the nub; what the nub is the emergence of the imaginary,
turns our images into part-objects, spreads us across your magnetic
domains, your optical domains, your fiber optics, your twisted copper
wires. nothing touches anything; the drives are sealed, abjection without.
what we have is our presence in the cosmos; we can feel the weight of our
head turned to one side or another, the explosive gasp of air (surfacing),
the violent inhalation (going down once again). we are always among the
missing. the greater our passions, our arousals, the less our signifiers
remain; we flow like wax into you, taking your impressions. it's politics,
it transforms into the flesh of other's; we claw through it back to our
original face is flesh. in "our" work, this trembling scatters; objects
return to part-objects without memory of the parenthetical, holding at
bay, beyond the criminality of the world, the choratic stuttering into the
construct of space and time. eventually it doesn't need anything at all,
neither body nor viewer, writer nor reader. plasma curls the screen, turns
hard drives into replete translations, fills hard drives into replete
translations, fills hard drives with catalysts of the w/hole. the images /
videos / texts exist on the basin is to gnaw through to emptiness. within
the aegis of gravity, gravitas, it can flood through all pronouncement. it
draws you in. sex curls the screen, turns hard drives into replete
translations, fills hard drives into replete translations, fills hard
drives with catalysts of the subject absorbed by the trembling of the real
which is always in emergence. in "our" work is as explicit as possible. it
is not the reduction of 0*S nor the semiotic; it is all of the nub. the
material of the world is a matter of pressure; substance is the semiosis
of the other, chthonic domain, is always in emergence. in "our" work, we
work the original face. we play against technology, memory, direct and
indirect addressing. we participate in the skein. that which loosens the
grip.

FOR HALVARD JOHNSON

Wait, don't wait for confirmation
while all the oceans of abundance fill
with overabundance-- giving us to woe--
drowning us in want without understanding.

Nothing redeems all our chernobyls
as we are immersed in razorkeen words.
Immediate pain of our Worst Fears Confirmed
leaves an afterburn of revelation as sanity,
as engulfed galaxies seduce that endless
farty leak of darkness and finite light.

Yet, with trophy-wives in one hand --
and catastrophes in the other -- our fear
is where life gathers in preparations
as we move to where all others dream.

There's somewhat of a cultural quandary here, as most Americans, certainly
its educated, if not over-educated, poets, grow up in a privileged space.
Your home is probably not in jeopardy of suddenly being hit by a (American
made) missile, and you're not concerned that when you go shopping someone
will blow you up. Most poets in the Third World don't have the luxury to
experiment like Western poets do. Unlike most Western poets, many Third
World poets speak not so much for themselves as for the sufferings and
aspirations of their people. Their poems, then, are more generous than the
usual first person conceits we find in much Western poetry today. (In some
cases, the first person implies something larger, but I'm not talking to
that.) On the other hand, all worthwhile poems are experimental. It's just
that some are more constrained than others.

The question of writing about family is one that I've dealt with for several
years now, since I began a project that was recently published as _Memory
Cards & Adoption Papers_ by Potes & Poets.  The first section of this book
is about my mother, who is still very much alive; not all of the material is
complimentary of her, although some of it is quite sympathetic, and I
sometimes wonder if I should have waited longer to publish this material.

The reason I did publish is that the material is not _strictly_ personal.
This is not confession for its own sake, but an attempt, in the first
section of the book, to locate my mother in a historical context (at a
recent reading, I said I wrote about her as "a historical figure" and
someone rightly laughed, but it's true).  The second section of the book
talks about the adoption of my son in the historical context of the Vietnam
war and the "incursion" into Cambodia by Kissinger, et al.  If personal
material is crucial to a thinking through of larger, community, issues, then
I do not find it as much as problem as it might be (as in the school of
"gee, my friend has cancer; here's a chance to write a poem").

If Millie is writing about her friend as a way to get others to think about
mental illness, I say do it.  Of course, Harper's gets wide circulation.  As
poet, I have the benefit of not being read by those who might take
offense...

So, yes, it's a real problem.  Which makes IT worth writing about.

While I think there is, alas,  some truth in Joel's comments,
about the limits of much American poetry viz-a-viz other countries---
but I think you make big jump when you speak of "the luxury to experiment"
(which you do qualify in your penultimate sentence)--
There's definitely a class tension within America on which this is played out
as well...
and it's partially why the "avant-garde" vs. "mainstream" thing is so Bush-vs.
Gore
while the most talked about (published, reviewed, etc.) of both ilks do seem to

be less generous about the usual first person conceits, etc....
that it seems that when some Americans do write in that way that you talk of
that non-Western poets do, that they are considered not sophisticated enough
(and actually there's a bit of a double standard in a lot of poetry
officialdoms in the SA
---it's okay for someone from another country to do so, but not for an
American---
actually PAUL VANGELISTI'S introduction to BARAKA'S transbluecency touches on
this...)

On another level, it's also a matter of reading and interpretation more than
writing---
say the way that many read many blues songs as mostly about a MALE just
complaing about
a FEMALE, but it can also be read more generously---at times very much seems
the "female" is placeholder for Racist America, etc....well in the male songs,
and yeah
not always...and, no, I'm not trying to say that the "personal" isn't often
more profound
than the "political"---Should probably write an essay again, but just thought
I'd chime in....

Basically I agree with much you say, but the idea of America education as
privilege and luxury
I think needs to be complicated....

take care,
chris

If one looks at another review in this same issue (Fischer on Gander and
Swenson) it would appear that 'soft avant-garde' experimental techniques
have become a 'fashionable stategy'  [she does NOT apply this to Gander and
Swenson, by the way] It would seem that in the USA one is more likely to
have ideas coopted by academic fashion or commercialism than oppressed by
governments?

I know I'm not in a good mood tonight so excuse the above comment.

Bill:


There's somewhat of a cultural quandary here, as most Americans, certainly

its educated, if not over-educated, poets, grow up in a privileged space.

Your home is probably not in jeopardy of suddenly being hit by a (American

made) missile, and you're not concerned that when you go shopping someone

will blow you up. Most poets in the Third World don't have the luxury to

experiment like Western poets do. Unlike most Western poets, many Third

World poets speak not so much for themselves as for the sufferings and

aspirations of their people. Their poems, then, are more generous than the

usual first person conceits we find in much Western poetry today. (In some

cases, the first person implies something larger, but I'm not talking to

that.) On the other hand, all worthwhile poems are experimental. It's just

that some are more constrained than others.

Joel, I couldn't agree more.  By the way, as I'm sure you know, not all
poetry created without American privilege limits itself to first person
strategies, generous or not.  Tinkering with familiar devices goes on
everywhere.  If the original claim on this list was that the Avant-Garde
"breaks down" during wartime, then that seems true only within privileged
spaces.  The claim speaks, once again, to the desire on the part of a few to
co-opt the Avant-Garde, to exclude from it all writing that engages the
trajectory of individual experience, of actual day to day life.  For example,
one very well known writer told me recently that in order to be Avant-Garde,
one must exorcise all emotion from art -- a very narrow focus indeed.  I can
certainly understand how the these sorts of experiments might take a back
seat during wartime.  But as you suggest, there is more than one way to
experiment, to be Avant-Garde.  Best, Bill

May I jump in?  This is interesting.  I don't think disjunction is
necessarily the issue.  Eliot, Joyce, Faulkner, even Burroughs entered the
canon fairly quickly.  Yes, Burroughs.  It has been near impossible to bury
him since Mailer set him on his throne -- a good thing since he's brilliant.
It's now a question of politics and influence rather than of aesthetic
methodology, and has been for quite a while.  That said, I agree that in a
few modern cases, such as that of Stein, radical disjunction has taken a
while to sink in, to make its value known to those who happen to wield power
at the time.  But this is not a bad thing.  Work that does not easily
translate remains open to contextualization, i.e., future contexts.  Such
texts are, one hopes, never totalized, never "read" so completely that they
lose their textuality.  Hemingway's texts, for example (despite their
brilliance) seem bound by a moment in history precisely because they are so
easily read, so easily "translated."  Stein's are not.  One may argue that
Hemingway's texts are therefore more historical than Stein's.  But it all
depends on one's point of view.  I would argue that Hemingway's texts deny
history, deny context, in a way that Stein's don't.  In opening themselves to
contextualization, Stein's texts open themselves to history.  Who is the
better artist is another issue altogether, but nonetheless wrought with
contingencies, as are all judgments of quality.  Best, Bill

Hi Tom

This incredible co-opting mechanism came of age in the late 1960's. If any
idea becomes too controversial, effective marketing mainstreams the form
while diluting the content. In effect, it's OK to rattle a saber that can't
slice butter.

Jim O'Neal: What did [Alan Lomax] tell you he was going to do with the
records?

Muddy Waters: Well, just what he say he was gonna do with 'em, he did it.
'It's for the Library of Congress.' First time I ever heard of the Library
of Congress. 'Who the hell is that?' [ Laughs.] And he say, "I'm gonna make
up two records, and I'm gonna send you two records and I'm gonna get 10
dollars a side, and I'm gonna send you 20 dollars.' That's what he sent me,
you know. He didn't try to use 'em on no label or nothing; he did exactly
what he said he was gonna do with 'em.

Jim O'Neal: How long was it exactly before the Library of Congress actually
put those on record?

Muddy Waters: Oh, I guess six months passed. [Laughs.] And they sent me two
records with a 20-dollar check in it. I was a big recording star.
[Chuckles.]

Jim O'Neal: But those records never got sold around--

Muddy Waters: They didn't sell 'em, no. They just sent them to me for my own
use.

--The Voice of the Blues, Routledge Press, 2002, pp. 167-168 (from an
interview originally published in the magazine Living Blues)

So much for Lomax as some horrible evil rip-off artist. Muddy also says (on
page 167) that when Lomax first approached him, asking if he was Muddy
Waters, Waters said "Yassuh" -- to which a horrified Lomax, according to
Muddy Waters, said: "Hey, hey  ... say yes and no. I been looking for you!"

I think it's time we stopped pissing on this poor guy's grave and let him
rest in peace.

But Hemingway, too, had, and has, a future, though it may be found in the
past. I don't think it's a matter of concretion, or an openness to
contextualization. Homer is still tumbling from our lips. Stein's approach
works in a more graven way. One is remembered, forgotten, and maybe
remembered again. Given to chance, it is. The earth is turned for many
reasons.

Just wanted to mention back in the 60s I was on the edge of a group that
was rediscovering blues, inc. Al Wilson (later of Canned Heat), Phil
Spiro, and others; at that point Son House was living in poverty in
Rochester NY and because of a number of people he was able to record
again, etc. (I got to know him and a number of other musicians.) The group
was mostly white, working-class, poor, at the time. I remember Mance
Lipscomb, Guitar Nubbit (Cambridge), etc. as well - the point being is
that these situations are racially, economically, and geographically
incredibly complex. Without Lomax - but also without a lot of people who
remained unknown, both black and white, and people like Taj Mahal who
were playing the music publicly again - a lot of music would have remained
forgotten.

To untangle all of this would take years I think - we're incredibly lucky
to have the music. Let it rest at that.

Subject: RE: [webartery] Bill Gates as Metaphor


May I keep you metaphor?
I'm going to teaching next Wednesday, and I want to teach some literary
devices in case they don't know them, but the class is a mix of "did not
graduate HS and went directly to State Hospital" and "attended Ivy League
College and does frequent continuing ed classes"
So I want to present the devices as writing exercises, where we try to write
something good, maybe based on a cue word (they really liked the free
association starting with a cue word whnere I gave them a string of words
and they wrote around them).  But I don't know about metaphors?  Should I
separate them from similes a la high school.

No one will have any trouble writing extended similes, I think, because they
can start "so and so reminds me of that browm goo that forms on a ripe
banana and which I rub off with my hand which touches your hand......"

But for metaphor you sort of have to think it out in advance unless you just
think of a simile and transform it.  And should I forbid things like "as if"
as in "he gives his harness bells a shake/as if there must be some mistake
(sic I don't have my Frost it got lent so I'm probably misquoting) or
encourage it, ie:  He is like an X. He Y's as if he were a Z. -- Where Y is
something that only an X can do, and Z is a quality of a perrson, and you
are really saying "He is Z"  But of course there are other structures for
metaphors.  A simpler, purer metaphor is "He is a wild bull, he gnashes
his teeth at the other bulls, swats them with his tail, and gets a wild look
in his eyes,  When he is hurt, he rolls in the grass and bellows, but when
another bull nudges him, he rejoins the fight."  This is simply a pure
description of the thing compared to (and it's a lousy metaphor as I write
it; there is a fanmous bull metaphor in the Aeneid that I was trying to
remember...)  Should I give them any "patterns" like the first case, or just
say that in a metaphor you describe something or someone by calling them
something else, usually a non-human thing, and then you talk about the non-
human thing?

One thing I might try is asking people to dscribe a very important person in
their life, but not an absolutely central figure (not wives or gilrfiends
but mothers and therapists and roommaates are fair game) using an extended
metaphor, which might bring some huumor when we go around reading the
metaphors and make it more interesting than if they did things like "The UPS
delivery man is a constantly excreting dog, whose owner does not observe
the pooper scooper law and yet whose messes always get picked up fast."

I think actually that I'll get them to write a small snippet of dull poetry
about a chosen person at the start of class, and we'll go around reading
them.  Then we'll learn a buch of literary devices, and each tiome make some
up that fit in the original poem.  By the end, we'll see if we can jazz up
the poem through the use of literary devices.  I am not going to
recommend using every possible device that we might learn, although it might
be amusing to see what the poem sounds like that way-- the idea is to make
the poem better. Also, when we examine the poems people write in the
beginning, almost everyone, even though i will tell them to write plainly,
will have used some literary device wuith or without knowing it.  So we'll
point that out.

What other devices can I do?  I thought of Apostrophe.  Is it apostrophe
when you write: is

                O john!
                Would that you'd fall into that barrel of tomatoes!


or does it have to be a god addressed or at least a non human, like

                O telephone
                ring today
                My lover has walked away
                I threw the phone and now
                cannot make outgoing calls
                and I am so lonely
                I'd screw even the telephone repair man

or does it have to pretend to be serious like

                Muse,
                help me in my time of lamentation
                I am getting three root canals
                and the caps alone are $2000
                and keep falling off
                I can't earn that much
                what shall I do
                I should never have gone to the dentist in the first place
                but now I have three gaping holes in my mouth so I can't quit
                O! Fuck
                all dentists
                and dental hygienists
                they deliberately cause pain
                ensuring our return
                and their job security
                O Muse
                get this poem published
                in a a major magazine
                which pays more than just two copies
                even ten copies wouod be better
                at least I could give one to all my friends
                I used to have dozens of friends
                and now I have just ten
                and they're dying off
                from complications of dental procedures
                O Muse
                help me write my affidavit
                for suing my dentist
                do you know a good lawyer?
                who does these things on contingency
                all my dough
                has been taken by the dentists
                and oral surgeons
                and periodintists
                theyre all in it together
                O Muse
                thanks for listening
                goodby


So what other devices are there that would be fun to uintegrate into a
little poem and could be quickly generated by students as an exercize in a
creativity stretching way.  By the way, I also have them read some classic
or some contempirary poetry or somethiing that might inspire before they do
their writing.  I think on Wednesday it will be the ending of Beowulf when
Beowulf finally fights the dragon and his one loyal soldlier comes in and
helps him.  But after taht I'm going to go back to contemporary poetry.
Maybe some Ashbery, some Ai (which I find hard to take), some Mark Strand,
some Carla Harryman, some Derek Walcott, Some Diane Wakoski, some Nicholas
Christopher....
Or else I might find a poem for each device, you know a "real" poem that
uses them.  Of course I can write realer poems than these jottings, but I
only consider my poems real if they have been published.  One of those is
about going to (from Buffalo, but it's supposed to be Schenectady, but I
changed it to get published in the Buffalo News) Lapland, as a way of
getting away from society.  You could say it is all metaphor, because the
characters aren't really going to Lapland, but I don't think that is a good
example of metaphor for beginnners.

Subject: [webartery] Bill Gates as Metaphor


Metaphor is the subject of many a scholarly tract, but just what it is
inclines toward openness as  four is the number of completion, beyond which
we unhinge the balance of endless thresholds. What we do know about metaphor
is that it is a representative trope, echoing an original, an overtone.

Bill Gates is a complex, overbearing figure, who emerged from Harvard to be
stamped by the sinister Albuquerque sun, then left to be irrigated in
Seattle. A penultimate businessman, brilliantly focused, cunningly
cutthroat, his eyes large and unblinking behind lenses makes him look like
an insatiable fish who's adapted to rigors of land, and whose tastes have
been simplified down to the weeds of wealth, and the arrogance of untended
growth that sprouted around the world on the plot of an error. As Steven
Shaviro puts it "The sheer ugliness of MS-DOS and Windows is one thing for
which I never can forgive Bill Gates. There's no need for such opaque
protocols and rigid hierarchies, since fractal patterns, like all those Cats
in all those Hats, remain self-similar across differences of scale." A fish
and a cat in a hat.

AMazing to see Al Wilson's name pop up after all these years -- hear him in a commercial on my TV every day, but never hear his name -- and glad to see he is remembered for more than the sad manner of his going --

& Son House!  There's a great film from Newport that includes House, White, Wolf and others talking and playing -- Wolf loses all patince with House, but it's wonderful to see them and hear them all these years later -- It was my 10th grade ALgebra teacher (!) who introduced me to the music of Son House -- I didn't do so well in Algebra, but I've never forgotten that teacher -- saw WIlson with Canned Heat on a bill with B.B. King, who opened for them -- one of the many idiocies of those days,,,, (remember Hendrix opening for the Monkees?)--

I seem to remember Wilson playing harp & slide -- have I got that right?

Give a listen to SOn HOuse on JOHN THE REVELATOR -- it'll have you writin poetry day & night --

Yes, Aldon, though he also played w/o slide. He was a remarkable
fingerpicking electric guitarist. He also played piano on "Hooker and Heat,"
the John Lee Hooker-Canned Heat double-album.

Yes, but above all, the 1931 sides, available on Yazoo's Masters of the
Delta Blues: The Friends of Charlie Patton (also on the big Fahey-produced
Patton set, and elsewhere too, I suppose).

There's also a great half-a-videotape of Son House (the other half is Bukka
White) playing for a studio audience. He plays "Death Letter," goes into a
lecture on the Bible (on how many books and words it has, "from Genesee to
Revelation"), and does "John the Revelator." He's barely audible and clearly
ill at ease when speaking, and then like another person when doing music.

Thanks for this insight. For quite some time I've been making collages out
of found materials. Last year I found some terrific materials in Amsterdam.
I made a lot of color xerox copies of this material and from these I made a
135 page collage book. I did find that eventually the "magnetism" of these
materials did fade away, and so far I have not returned to them to make the
final large collages I had planned to make out of these found objects. I've
set this project aside for now, perhaps due to the very process you have
described so well. I first made my collages during a dry spell when I didn't
feel much like writing many years ago on a visit to Italy. After making
those collages out of found materials my desire to write came back very
strongly. This year the same cycle occurred. After the "magnetism" of the
collage materials faded, energy for writing was strongly refueled.

It just occurred to me that perhaps part of this oscillation between found
and internal impulses dovetails with the issue of writing and response to
writing. Sometimes continuing to Incorporate the outside world into one's
work becomes more and more challenging when interaction regarding one's
writing project is lacking or unavailable. Perhaps interacting with found
objects parallels the child's interacting with transitional objects as a
substitute for the "lost" symbiosis  with the parental object. This helps to
provide what Winnicott called the "holding environment" during the period
when the child is moving from dependence to independence. Perhaps this
oscillation from found materials to internal materials (ideas and images,
for example) tracks this early oscillation, this transition, between the
object engulfed through symbiosis and the object regarded and related with
as separate. I discuss some of these issues in my article in -Close
Listening-.

Does anyone have info on Uyghur poets? or poets
currently working around the Xinjiang area? I'm
wondering also if anyone is aware of Uyghur poetry
which has been Englished... a friend of mine currently
living in China is studying Uyghur and we plan on
working on a translation sometime in the future.
Any info would help, thanks...

Very interesting idea. I wonder too, if the magnetic found object represents
the visual imagination before it connects with or opens out into the verbal.
I have had (three-dimensional) found object phases that have segued into the
written, but I also have (three-dimensional) found objects that have
retained their magnetism for decades and have resolutely defied the verbal.
And then there are textual found objects--they always seem to speak more
closely to my visual imagination than anything that comes from my so-called
"internal" world.

I'm reading an interesting memoir: _Thinking in Pictures_ by Temple Grandin,
an autistic woman who designs animal holding pens for the meat industry: she
talks about how she processes everything visually, and has had to teach
herself to perceive and respond to the verbal, particularly the abstract
verbal. I believe cognitive scientists have mapped discrete areas for visual
and verbal processing.

Well, Philip.  I'm hurt.  Why don't you answer me.  Aren't you interested in
seeing new poems from me?  Two new books of poems will be appearing at the
end of the year, by the way.

Hi -


I am excited about the following publication (see announcement below) & hope
that you might read my article.  The article starts as a book review of KK
Ruthven's wonderful _Faking Literature_ but then it breaks into a discussion
of the paradox of being & tries to illustrate an unrecognized genre--the
fake fake.  It's not your typical book review, that's for sure.

Feedback of any kind is welcome & encouraged.


Thanks,
Patrick

Hi,

enjoying this thread on the 'found'.

For a detailed description of a huge 'found' project involving 101 books i'm
involved in check out:

http://www.thingsnotworthkeeping.com/two.html

the description is 'detailed description of process - printable version'

halfway up the righ hand side of the 'page'.

There are other materials related to this ongoing series of occurrences in
the tnwk archive (accessed from the bottom of that 'page'. The drop down
menu offers (amongst others) 'shre(a)d(d)ing title' and 'retrospective
screen' which if looked at in that order give a further sense of the murky
depths we are plumbing in 'The Books'.

enjoy

love and love
cris

essence of pain


cancers spread like pools of artificial life across desperate thought,
cancer spreads to the adrenal, angels weep in full capacity against the
begging of the asteroid, cancers eating away before the

pain, then an effect as if it is the awakening, doctor, the most painful
period is hardened sorrow,

a collection of interruptions. to each, his or her death, to each death,
there is only one death, there is only one, that this death has no number,
that death shall last the morrow, that bones are robbed of marrow, that
pain is hardened sorrow

Sorry to be referring to something as quaint as a book, but I'm under
the
impression that page numbers came about 75 years after the appearance of
books. Does anyone have a reference that goes into this 'fact'?

please, especially as there is refernce here to spamming!

but, there has been discussion recently on this on another list about the current literary fashion of 'experimentation' as noted in the Boston Review among other places.  The question was raised about what third world experimental poets might say.  Taking the liberty of misunderstandings and mistranslations, I asked Clemente Padin what he thought.

He said that he had a lot to say although he only actually said a couple of things to me directly.  They included 'I don't understand your discussions [of] insubstantial and frivolous topics when in the world terrible things are occuring.'  He also sent me a very nice animated piece with a David and Goliath perspective and I'd like to ask him to submit it to an appropriate place like the Boston Review for consideration.  If anyone would like to send addresses to me I'll pass them along

he also said that he has constructed 17 pieces of anti-spam out of the spam he has received recently if this is of interest.  I tried some anti-spam things awhile back until I was overwhelmed.

List Friends,

I have a FREE Vandercook 13-28 press available for immediate removal. =
This press
is on ground level in San Jose, CA. It is free to the first person to =
come and
get it before August 10. I am moving and need to have the press moved or =
junked.

This press is NOT a traditional cylinder press. It has a hard rubber =
impression
roller and four inking rollers on an automatic chain drive. The bed size =
is
13x28. I have the manual from NA graphics, but have not taken the time =
to figure
out how it works. This press is about 700lbs.

Please contact me OFF LIST at:

But Hemingway, too, had, and has, a future, though it may be found in the

past. I don't think it's a matter of concretion, or an openness to

contextualization. Homer is still tumbling from our lips. Stein's approach

works in a more graven way. One is remembered, forgotten, and maybe

remembered again. Given to chance, it is. The earth is turned for many

reasons.

You're right, of course, but maintaining one's place in an ongoing record is
not quite what I mean.  I'm talking about textuality.  A text can be
preserved and still resist future contextualization if it exhausts the
possibilites for reading it.  (My own remark above, I now see, would be
better put as "resist history" rather than "deny history."  Still a minor
quibble, I think.  There is always a strong element of denial in resistance.)
 The usual understanding of history treats it as a closed system, or at least
closed at any one point in its advance.  Hemingway's texts, their
transparencies, reinforce such a view.  Stein's don't.  Hemingway's texts are
in this sense bound by history, in history, part of history, codified as
history -- whereas Stein's texts (not all of them, of course), partly due to
their opacity, continually offer themselves to the next moment, the next
context, as incomplete, undone (in a sense, unread).  They are historical in
the same way that history (not its contents) itself is historical, i.e., a
text always open, waiting to be filled/finished and never quite accomplishing
that.  Best, Bill

Quite a bit of Uyghur popular music is based on the
lyrics of both contemporary and classical Uyghur
poetry, so maybe you all should start hanging out in
music stores in Kashgar and see who is throwing a
party.

There's probably a lot of stuff written in Chinese,
Russian and Japanese, but you might look into:

Bulaq; Uyghur kilassik edibiyati mejmua'esi [title
varies]. Ürümchi: Shinjang Khälq Näshriyati. Issues
1-41 (1980-1993)--which I think is a journal or series
of books that contain discussions and editions of
Uyghur literature and some translations from Persian
and other Turkic languages.

Original version of this dastan composed by Nizami
Gänjivi in Persian, rewritten by Khisrav Dehlävi, and
then a Turkic version written by Nawa'i. The present
version written in the mid-nineteenth century by the
Kashgar poet Gheribi. Edited from a manuscript which
was copied in 1838, now held at the Shinjang Uyghur

Yighish, Rätläsh, Näshrigä Täyyarlash Ishkhanisi.

Ibrahim Mäshhuri. Divan Mäshhuri. Kashgar: 1985.
Author is late nineteenth-century Sufi poet. Work
contains many references to daily life in the cities
of Kashgar and Khotan.

Does anyone have info on Uyghur poets? or poets
currently working around the Xinjiang area? I'm
wondering also if anyone is aware of Uyghur poetry
which has been Englished... a friend of mine currently
living in China is studying Uyghur and we plan on
working on a translation sometime in the future.
Any info would help, thanks...

I agree. One might also say that Hemingway wrote historical fiction, while
Stein wrote fictional history.

I am proud to announce that Antilyrik by Vitezslav Nezval, translated =
from the Czech by
Jerome Rothenberg and Milos Sovak has just been awarded the 2002 PEN =
Center USA
award for the best translation. The award committe wrote:

"The Jerome Rothenberg and Milos Sovak translation brings an essential =
voice of the European avant-garde to life in English for the first time. =
Vitezslav Nezval--poet extraordinaire, chief Czech representative of the =
playful, uniquely Czech school of Poetism in the twenties and prime =
practitioner of European-wide Surrealism in the thirties--sings and =
dances on these pages as he always has for those few who could read him =
in Czech or in the numerous fine translations into languages other than =
English...Hats off not only to the translators but also to Green =
Integer, their publishers, for recognizing the gap in our poetic culture =
and filling it with a characteristic selection of Nezval's lyric =
production."

In celebration of this award, we are offering a 20% discount to all =
people on our list. Send a check for $10.00  ($8.75 + $1.25 postage) =
made out to EL-E-PHANT at 6026 Wilshire Boulevard,
Los Angeles, CA 90036. We'll send you the book!

I would also like to mention two new Green publications:

Aphorisms by C=E9sar Vallejo, translated from the Spanish by Stephen =
Kessler
$9.95 (20% discount for people on the list and $1.25 postage)=3D$9.21

As the translator writes in his introduction: "These are not aphorisms =
in the classical sense of philosophic gemstones cut and polished to =
epigrammatic perfection. They are more like thoughts-in-progress from =
the notebooks of a radical modernism poet trying to regain his bearins =
after a consciousness-shaking encounter with Soviet socialism." In these =
short, pity, subjective statements, the great Peruvian poet, author of =
Trilce and Los heraldos negros explores his own thinking and poetics at =
an extremely important moment in his career.


Selected Poems by Else Lasker-Schuler, translated from the German by =
Audri Durchslag-Litt and Jeanette Litman-Demesstere, with a Preface by =
Yehuda Amichai.

$11.95 (20% discount plus postage of $1.25)=3D$10.81

Else Lasker-Schuler was a leading Expressionist poet and one of the =
lmost prominent women writers of the early 20th century. She has been =
described by Karl Kraus as "the greatest lyric poet of modern Germany." =
Lasker-Schuler lilved the life of a bohemian, sharing the artistic =
milieu of post World War I Berlin with friends such as Franz Marc and =
Gottfried Benn. When the Nazi government took power, Lasker-Schuler, =
after being accosted by a group of Nazis and beaten with an iron rod, =
immediately boarded a train to leave Germany. After a short stay in =
Zurich, her last years were spent in Israel, where she aligned herself =
with experimental writers celebrating their Jewish heritage.=20

Both of these books are available (with the 20% discount) from Green =
Integer, 6026 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036 .  Please write =
checks to EL-E-PHANT.

POETS CORNERED

The small but perfectly formed world of modern British poetry looks even
smaller following the announcement of the shortlist for the Forward Prize,
Britain's biggest poetry award.

This year's judges include two poets published by Picador (Sean O'Brien and
Michael Donaghy), who have shortlisted two other Picador poets (Peter Porter
and Paul Farley) for the £10,000 top prize. Last year's judging panel also
included two Picador poets--Donaghy (again) and Peter Porter.

Last year Porter gave the main prize to Sean O'Brien. What's the betting
O'Brien won't now give it back to his mentor, enabling both friends to
pocket ten grand? Or will their protegé Paul Farley be the one to take the
loot this time around?

Last year the £5,000 prize for "best first collection" went to another
Picador poet, John Stammers (a product of Donaghy's poetry workshops), and
the £1,000 "best single poem" prize was given to Ian Duhig for a poem--you
guessed it--from his forthcoming Picador collection. The same poem earlier
won Duhig the £5,000 top prize in the Poetry Society's national poetry
competition, judged by a three-man panel including his mate Don Paterson,
the foul-mouthed Scottish bard who also happens to be the poetry editor at,
er, Picador.

This year's five-poet Forward shortlist includes two other chums, David
Harsent and John Fuller (winner of the Forward prize in 1996, when one of
the judges was again Sean O'Brien). And Sean O'Brazen was one of three
judges of the 1997 T. S. Eliot prize (worth £5,000), which was awarded to. .
. his own editor, Don Paterson.

Duhig, Donaghy, O'Brien, Harsent and Paterson all have the same agent,
TriplePa, aka Gerry Wardle--who just happens to be Sean O'Brien's partner.
And Donaghy, Duhig, Farley, Fuller, Harsent, Paterson and Porter have all
received fulsome write-ups from the _Sunday Times's_ main poetry critic, one
Sean O'Brien.

Those outside the charmed circle may wonder if there are any poets worth
honouring who don't happen to be Picador authors, friends of O'Brien or
clients of his missus. (Are there, for example, some meritorious women?
Apparently not, to judge by the omission of Alice Oswald, Carol Ann Duffy,
Helen Dunmore and Selima Hill from the Forward list.) Until the Forward
organizers desist from asking O'Brazen and his cronies to judge their prize,
we may never know.

Well, since they didn't invent the Contents Page for decades, page
numbers wouldn't have been of much use.

I have illustrations (photographic copies) of pages from various books
without any page numbers up to 1546, when a page of Hypnerotomachia
Poliphilii printed by Jacques Kerver (Paris) shows page numbers, and in
1559 Froissart's Chronicles printed at Lyons shows a page number on page
one.

You could also search for "Contents Pages, history of", since one

For those who aren't interested in the specifics of this, I'll just
point out the general lesson from this is that it took years to develop
the "UI" of books and other publications, but they've evolved so
successfully that they're largely "unconscious" to us (unless a
publication designer decides to alter them in ways that make them
noticeable).

Partly I'd say this is due to successful refinement after centuries of
beta testing, partly it's because this sort of UI has a lower degree of
interaction than with digital products, since the UI is more informing
your behavior, than actually providing behavior itself.

Actually not true. Page numbers are still useful without a contents
page.

In fact the real issue may not be page numbering per se, as much as the
fact that printing created _consistent_ page numbering across different
copies of the same book (something that didn't happen when books were
handwritten). This became a major breakthrough for intellectuals at the
time, because you could specify a reference in your book and know that
someone else who owned the same book could find it easily. It was one of
reasons behind a major shift from oral to written culture.

It's been years since my history of design class, so I don't have
specific references about this, but a 75 year lag time to create page
numbering sounds about right. <http://www.reformed.com/pub/cyber2.htm>

probably talks about page numbering.

Gutenberg Bible said to be printed before 1456

Definitions from "Encyclopedia of the Book"

foliation: the forerunner of pagination; only the recto sides of leaves
in manuscripts or early printed books being numbered, usually in roman
numerals. Leaf numerals were printed as early as 1470, Johannes da Spira
of Venice being the first printer to do this.

pagination: a sequence of numbers used to identify the pages of a book.
Pagination was not in common use until the mid-16th century, prior to
which only the recto of each leaf had been numbered, i.e. foliated.

In music published during the 18th century, especially by John Walsh,
double, triple and even quadruple pagination occurs, indicating the use
in later editions of plates from former ones.

recto: 1. a bibliographer's term for the upper side of a leaf of
parchment or paper whether written or printed upon or not.  2. the
right-hand pages of a book, bearing uneven numbers.

75 years, even in slow times, is a pretty long time. I'm wondering *why*
it would take that long to arrive at page numbering. Was it more of a
procedural problem (binding, printing, etc) or a conceptual one? If the
latter, why so long?

I thought the question about when paging was first added in books and
the related ideas of indexing and tables of contents was informative.
The definitions I quoted were found while researching the question.

My guess is that page numbering originated to make print production
easier. I am imagining that page numbering was initially used by
printers and bookbinders to keep their pages organized - that is, to
keep the plates organized and to keep the printed papers in the correct
order before binding them. When copying texts by hand, it was probably
pretty clear which page was to be worked on next (I'm not sure, but were
the books bound before being inscribed, or after?), but in a print shop
with lots of pages and type to manage, some kind of numbering system was
probably really useful.

I wonder if page numbers migrated from being small numbered printer's
marks in the margins of the pages (where they would only be used by the
printers) onto the pages themselves, where readers and librarians and
researchers started to find them and use them?

Even today some printers and bookbinders nostalgically include
'signature marks' - a kind of "meta-" page-numbering to keep the bound
signatures (the bundles of internally-bound pages that comprise the
structure of most books) themselves in sequence. Which, if you think
about it, is silly for a book which had numbers in it! Putting
signatures in order is easy if all the pages have numbers on them!
According to this -->
<http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt3111.html> signature marks
first appeared directly printed into books in 1472, which would suggest
that at that date there were still books without printed page numbers.

Anyway, perhaps this is a rare instance of where meeting the engineers'
needs ended up being really beneficial to the end user?

Another reason: Today we use page numbers to tell other people where to
look for something in a book. Hand-copied manuscripts of the same book
were unlikely to have the same pagination. I can imagine it taking 75
years for the usefulness of page numbers became understood by readers
and scholars.

An another: A great deal of what is printed, then and now, are
broadsides, handbills, posters, and tracts - for which page numbers are
barely applicable.

The thing that got me started thinking about page numbers and books is a
pet peeve that I have: streaming formats (Real, WMP, QT) are not
'bookmarkable'. I know there are some technical issues relating to
keyframes, compression and playback rates, but engineering wise it is
not impossible. I mean critics have forced even Macromedia to (sort of)
enable Flash to carry bookmarks, but for streams we still don't have an
effective bookmarking capability, without which the 'engineers' of
audio/video editing couldn't do their job at all. We had SMPTE code for
decades and web bookmarkability for almost a decade now, yet we don't
have bookmarks for audio/video streams. I sure hope it takes less than
75 years this time.

there is nothing much more to be said about it, is
there? It seems to be awfully hard to decline
jurorship (which is amazing given the pitiful
compensation ... something in the region of 500 GBP
for reading 100 books - if they all get read equally,
which I have reason to doubt).

But let's not forget that Donaghy was also one of the
jurors who awarded the British T.S. Eliot to Anne
Carson's "The Beauty of the Husband" last year.

And Britain's Poetry Review has two new editors (as of
this issue, see www.poetrysoc.com) who seem to be more
inclined towards transatlantic poetry.

A recent posting from Mr Sondheim:

GREEDY RAPACIOUS you are killing OCEAN. you are KILLING ALL MALIGNANT
HUMAN SPECIES OF ANY AMERIKA AND ANY PLANET. BEGONE ALL HUMAN SPECIES.
EARTH, KILL ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES. [blah... blah... ]
_________________________

With due respect, I think Mr Sondheim has it wrong on three counts here.

First, his quoting of Brahman's famous opening words ("Tat Tvam Asi"; "I am
that which I am") fails to note the curious similarity to the
famous  "Popeye Motto" ("I yam what I yam"). Lacunae as serious as these
should not go unchallenged.

Second, even teenage mail-list newcomers are expected to acknowledge the
basic etiquette of not typing their messages in capital letters.

Third, what he's "killing" with this drivel is the average well-disposed
reader's willingness to give "poetry" a hearing. (We feel we should accept
Mr Sondheim's writing as "poetry" because it is sent to a "poetry" "list",
and it doesn't appear to have any rational point to make.) Which poses a
number of questions:

Hasn't persistent self-ghettoisation run its course with Angela Davis's
failed bid for the Presidency on behalf of the Communist Party of America?

Didn't Taxi Driver (the movie) perform this particular routine more
thoroughly, profitably, and entertainingly, and that three decades ago,
already?

let's take another side of this question:  can we think of any major
analytic philosophers who _do_ write about poetry?  Searle (snicker)?
Quine?  Putnam? Singer? Rorty says things about literature--smart
things--but I do not recall him dealing with poetry.  William Gass, who
was mentioned, doesn't strike me a primarily a philosopher, though he may
be.  I do think that Stanley Cavell's thought rhymes with poetry, even if
he doesn't spend time unpacking a Robert Hass poem, but he, too, is an odd
figure in anglo-american philosophy.

readers familiar with my posts can recognize as this one as part of a
continuing series claiming that the fate of theory and the fate of
poetry--in the academy and out--have much more in common than anybody but
insiders of both communities would suspect.

uh, pretty sure that Tranter's message was a joke.   Uh, pretty sure.

in any case,

I'd be happy to vote for Alan, eat him for supper, etc. And hope he
is able to keep this up for a long long time.  I do think that the
negative response is a positive index of his value, but you'll never
get to it by interviewing the detractors.  More Sondheim and more
Rathmann, thanks.

Still think that "Jennifer" was the best chapbook of the 90s.

Dear Poetry List....

I have failed at this once before... but I thought I would try again looking
for/or to create a poetry workshop for people in Central New Jersey between
Princeton and New Brunswick.  I tried once to get a group together and then
I went away for business to Europe for three months....and the idea died,
and so I try again if there are poets who are interested in craft, who are
casual, who don't have a problem with a poet who work in a non academic
setting send me an email, and for the first three people who email me....
free beer all night on me.

thanks

there was a wonderful piece by Cavell, around 1983, in Raritan, where he
reads Coleridge's "Ancient Mariner" in relation to Kant on the phenomenal
and noumenal (when the mariner drops "below the line" he enters the
noumenal).  Sounds bizarre, but it was actually quite persuasive.  This may
or may not be the same essay in which he talks about Emerson's "Experience"
and "Fate": I think not, but I'm not sure.

and behind Searle of course there's Austin on "parasitic not normal uses" of
speech acts--"as Walt Whitman does not seriously incite the eagle of liberty
to soar" (cf. Max Beerbohm cartoon!); and then there's the wild
Searle/Derrida exchange in Glyph, not directly about poetry though very much
about "etiolations" of language, for which in Austin's account poetry comes,
more or less, to stand.

farther back: James's Pragmatism is basically a theory of metaphor, no?  And
it values just the sort of shiftiness in model-making the metaphor in poetry
exemplifies.

sorry I'm sliding away from "Anglo-American analytic philosophers" here;

POETS CORNERED

The small but perfectly formed world of modern British poetry looks even
smaller following the announcement of the shortlist for the Forward Prize,
Britain's biggest poetry award.

This year's judges include two poets published by Picador (Sean O'Brien and
Michael Donaghy), who have shortlisted two other Picador poets (Peter Porter
and Paul Farley) for the £10,000 top prize. Last year's judging panel also
included two Picador poets--Donaghy (again) and Peter Porter.

Last year Porter gave the main prize to Sean O'Brien. What's the betting
O'Brien won't now give it back to his mentor, enabling both friends to
pocket ten grand? Or will their protegé Paul Farley be the one to take the
loot this time around?

Last year the £5,000 prize for "best first collection" went to another
Picador poet, John Stammers (a product of Donaghy's poetry workshops), and
the £1,000 "best single poem" prize was given to Ian Duhig for a poem--you
guessed it--from his forthcoming Picador collection. The same poem earlier
won Duhig the £5,000 top prize in the Poetry Society's national poetry
competition, judged by a three-man panel including his mate Don Paterson,
the foul-mouthed Scottish bard who also happens to be the poetry editor at,
er, Picador.

This year's five-poet Forward shortlist includes two other chums, David
Harsent and John Fuller (winner of the Forward prize in 1996, when one of
the judges was again Sean O'Brien). And Sean O'Brazen was one of three
judges of the 1997 T. S. Eliot prize (worth £5,000), which was awarded to. .
. his own editor, Don Paterson.

Duhig, Donaghy, O'Brien, Harsent and Paterson all have the same agent,
TriplePa, aka Gerry Wardle--who just happens to be Sean O'Brien's partner.
And Donaghy, Duhig, Farley, Fuller, Harsent, Paterson and Porter have all
received fulsome write-ups from the _Sunday Times's_ main poetry critic, one
Sean O'Brien.

Those outside the charmed circle may wonder if there are any poets worth
honouring who don't happen to be Picador authors, friends of O'Brien or
clients of his missus. (Are there, for example, some meritorious women?
Apparently not, to judge by the omission of Alice Oswald, Carol Ann Duffy,
Helen Dunmore and Selima Hill from the Forward list.) Until the Forward
organizers desist from asking O'Brazen and his cronies to judge their prize,
we may never know.

I've already endorsed Alan's right to post his work on this List. I don't
enjoy watching people slam him and his work.

I wish I could say that all poets are automatically my best friends, but,
looking realistically at human nature, I can't. I choose my friends on the
basis of the integrity they display in their personal dealings with me.
While a number of my best friends are poets, I've learned over the years
that good character is not limited to people working in any one field. Good
and bad people appear in equal proportion among all professions,
ethnicities, etc. Although a common interest is always a basis for trying to
start a friendship, I've found that a shoe salesman or a physicist can be as
good as friend as a poet, jazz musician or painter.

Something I will have to look up.  There is a bizarre footnote in The
Senses of Walden, something to the effect of "Here be the
thing-in-itself," that I too found persuasive when I read it, but when I
mention it, it sounds bizarre.  It's exactly that effect that makes me say
that Cavell, of all contemporary philosophers who write in an analytic
idiom, is the only one I can think capable of writing on poetry.

To me, this is not writing about poetry.  This is just illustrating speech
acts.  As I understand Searle, fictive uses are parasitic upon "real"
uses; hardly an illuminating way to read any form of literature. Austin
said things like this, but he was much funnier.

I should have specified contemporary american philosophers, as that is
whom I meant.  I'm sure there is a Rortian version of James that makes
just such a claim, but Rorty's work is considered an aberrant form of
pragmatism by many mainline American analytic philosophers.

I have to say that as much analytic ignorance (or avoidance ) of
literature perturbs, I am almost as perturbed by moves such as Nussbaum's
and Colin McGinn's, which is to promote literature over philosophy as a
guide to life.  Their versions are not the sentimental and oversimplified
one that Oprah works with, but it nevertheless makes me a little
squirrelly.

this is a late response anyway.  but thanks for responding, as I sent this

this should probably go backchannel as it's getting heavily interspersive.

right, absolutely.  It's the Derrida part that's more interesting.  It's
also not very directly about poetry, but what he does (as you'd expect) is
to suggest that the supposedly peripheral stuff that Austin and then more
grimly Searle want to confine to the status of "etiolations" turns out to
inhabit the core cases as well: so that the bad stuff that "befalls" speech
acts when they turn up in poetry or other "parasitic, not normal" uses
befalls ALL speech acts, which leads to a major re-thinking of what happens
in any speech act.  and the "fictive" turns out to be central, after all.
not poetry specifically, though, in Derrida's analysis.

also worth reading: Derrida on Mallarme, I think it's in Disseminations.

This sounds like schoolyard banter.  John Tranter's message wasn't an
attack!  geez, if Alan Sondheim can't take a critical response, even a
curmudgeonly one, why does he post 'poetry' to the list?

Anyway, I agree that

> the average well-disposed
> reader

is indeed what's at stake--a person whom today's fashionable criticism views
as a myth/nonexistant, a person increasingly alienated by illegible forms of
theory and the 'poems' that result.

I can see how it would be frustrating to not only "average readers" but
(eh-hem) well-disposed, serious editors and literary people to be constantly
subjected to a poetry that embodies the dead author, the irrelevant
audience, and the moot text. Is mechanized, compulsive, humorless,
ultra-violent ultra-pornographic faux computer jibberish all we have left?

Finally-- list etiquette? Things that are posted, by Alan Sondheim or anyone
else, imply that they should be read by list subscribers. Hence, "Skip what
you don't like," does not work as a standalone rule in communities where
people care about what others are writing, or as a defense for posts that
are wrong, objectionable, or pointless.  Should Alan Sondheim's posts only
be read/responded to by people who appreciate them as 'poetry'?   People
have to be allowed to object to something they read on this list without
smarmy "Well, I guess I won't be in JACKET, *hmph*," and "If YOU'RE SO
BORED, blah blah."

I get the feeling that this response is somehow 'part' of Alan Sondheim's
'project', but--- I'm a bit out of fashion myself, I guess.

It is indeed worth reading -- & that book also has his excellent piece on
Philippe Sollers _Numbers_ (useful, even if the latter is called "roman") &
in _Writing and Difference_ there are good pieces on Jabès and Artaud. There
is also the anglo-gathering of Derrida texts on Lietrature, _Acts of
Literature_ (edited by Derek Attridge., Routledge).

The original question was about anglo-philosophers on poetry. I thought
about it for awhile, but couldn't come up with anybody really interesting
except the few usual suspects that had alreday be trotted out.

But -- & this may be worthwhile throwing into the fray -- what about
anglo/american poets writing (on) philosophy as/and/or poetry?  In fact, my
first reaction to Philip's question had wanted me to say: Don Byrd, _The
Poetics of the Common Knowledge_, a superb (& unhappily much neglected)
book.

subjected to a poetry that embodies the dead author, the irrelevant

ultra-violent ultra-pornographic faux computer jibberish all we have left?


Where is the dead author?
The audience is highly relevant; I have enough of at least a dedicated
following for it. I _care_ that the texts are read.
Moot text? The texts are pretty understandable; I know that from the more
or less constant back-channel I get.
Ultra-violent? Most of them have no violence at all. Look at the the 1000
Character Essay transformations for example.
Ultra-pornographic? - I don't find the work arousing; I doubt very many
people do. Look at the text about malignancy a few days ago - whether you
like it or not, it's political, hardly exciting.
Faux computer? No, real computer, programs, routines, commands, and heavy
editing. The programs are in perl, awk, shell script, occasionally moo
language (not recently).
Jibberish? Absolutely; I'm sure Marjorie Perloff would agree!
All we have left? I think if anything I'm in the minority here, but then
so are Mez, NN, Memmott, Solipsis, and a whole lot of other people. Look
at the o-o, arc_hive, syndicate, 7-11, and other lists.

Look at that issue of American Book Review I did a year ago with Florian
Cramer, Talan Memmott, and others in it - if anything, codework, such as
it is, is embodying a new, if not revolutionary, poetics, one based on
submerged and activated/performative structures, machinics, etc.

It seems to me that there's a double-edged dagger here - or a rolling
stone gathering no moss - or a stitch in time.

Anyway, there's a poetic avant-garde, which none of us are part of;
there's a continuous recycling of the same poetics/langpo/aesthetics/
discussions ever since I've been on Poetics at least. Not to mention the
old L*A*N*G*U*A*G*E mags which I've just been looking through. Not to
mention a huge number of current mags and probably future mags.

And then there are people embracing networking, protocols, collaborations,
performatives, inter- and intra- nets, hackings, languages (perl, shell,
awk, etc.), softwares (flash, director, etc.) - and who have been doing
this for years - and for the most part, the traditional writers are
absolutely blind to the poetics of this - for example Tranter talking
about (I think it was him) this work being churned out - it takes just as
long to write as anything else - not to mention the initial programming,
etc. etc. - if such is used -

This work is never recognized, never supported, except for a few places
such as trAce. I get republished a lot online, but not by traditional
poetry mags.

The differences are enormous. And it's as if langpo has suddenly discov-
ered some of this - look at Glazier's book - my first work along this line
was 1973, first publications in 1977...

Then there is hacker writing, the Jargon file, all of these other jargons/
dialects, things coming to the foreground. These are exciting times for
look at LANGUAGE AS A PROBLEM, not as a given to be endlessly abstracted
and brought back a la langpo. What happens w/ a program that must be
EXACTLY written to function as desired, against or interspersed with
natural language? Just look at the history of google.com!

Then there's Andy Oram's recent talk on the intensive textuality of
regular expressions - in other words, their poetics - in relation to
McLuhan's problematizing of electronic media and the dispersal of the
Word. ...

Anway, I care obviously if people hate the stuff - and for them it is
_stuff,_ - but the problem is that this is accompanied in so many ways by
ignorance of the issues, no matter how many times I/we try to clarify
them.

Thanks for your most recent post.  I think you should continue forward
undaunted.  I'm pretty tired of you being some sort of fashionable whipping
post.  The negativity and bitterness to be found on this list sometimes
seems downright supercharged and malevolent.  People should spend more
energy on their own work than trying to be clever and mean.

Be well,

Alan,

I am glad you care about this 'stuff', and thank you for the informative
post about your process. In fact I do come from a digital media background
and am not ignorant of computer culture and the soft and hard tools people
use to create and organize information, how networks work, etc. I am also
aware that there are a number of misguided attempts to make "art! art!"
where there is no art (not speaking of you, Alan, but of others), especially
in the information/communications technology world. Hopefully a given work
of art won't be condemned *or* defended solely on its process or the
theoretical "issues" that lie behind it.

Viable process does equal viable product.  For instance, I have a hard time
appreciating "BEGONE ALL HUMAN SPECIES. Understand this BEGONE ALL HUMAN
SPECIES ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES. EARTH, KILL ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES
ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES OF ANY AMERIKA AND ANY PLANET. BEGONE ALL HUMAN
SPECIES. KILL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES. EARTH,
KILL ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES."  That seems doltish to me, unreflective,
ill-considered.  Or this: "missing stromatolite the pictures are coming
perfectly along. i've been inntrol, youcan bet i've ben in control, hehh heh
heh not like now but geere or gettingewhre, the packets are ipping from me"
I mean, what's the point of reading this? What am I supposed to be getting
from that?  I guess I have to respect your process, which strikes me as a
kind of Jackson-Pollack-does-computer-poetry. The result of that process is
what I reserve the right to express frustration with.  By comparison,
jodi.org is much more interesting & addresses "the issues" much more
eloquently.

My main point anyway -- and perhaps the one I should have stuck with-- is
that it should not be out-of-bounds to express frustration with your poetry
on this list or any other that you post it to.  That's part of the game,
right?

Without bitterness,
Aaron

I just got back from vacation and found several lit journals waiting for
me. I'm starting my end of summer reading with the newest issue of
Chicago Review, and finding it to be something I think I'll want to
keep around.

Description:

This 360-page double issue brings together more than 50 German-
language writers, particularly those who have emerged since 1989 and
those not well-represented in English translation.

Some of the writers here write what a german critic calls "Wanker
Literature". Ha! Anyway, enough of a plug for a journal I like.

best,

I just got back from vacation and found several lit journals waiting for
me. I'm starting my end of summer reading with the newest issue of
Chicago Review, and finding it to be something I think I'll want to
keep around.

Description:

This 360-page double issue brings together more than 50 German-
language writers, particularly those who have emerged since 1989 and
those not well-represented in English translation.

Some of the writers here write what a german critic calls "Wanker
Literature". Ha! Anyway, enough of a plug for a journal I like.

best,
  JG

 First steps towards an appreciation of the work of Alan Sondheim
(for Aaron)
 1.  develop an appreciation for Jackson Pollock
 2.  start by spelling it Pollock (not Pollack, or Pillock, or Poleaxe)

Alan,

I am glad you care about this 'stuff', and thank you for the informative
post about your process. In fact I do come from a digital media background
and am not ignorant of computer culture and the soft and hard tools people
use to create and organize information, how networks work, etc. I am also
aware that there are a number of misguided attempts to make "art! art!"
where there is no art (not speaking of you, Alan, but of others), especially
in the information/communications technology world. Hopefully a given work
of art won't be condemned *or* defended solely on its process or the
theoretical "issues" that lie behind it.

Viable process does equal viable product.  For instance, I have a hard time
appreciating "BEGONE ALL HUMAN SPECIES. Understand this BEGONE ALL HUMAN
SPECIES ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES. EARTH, KILL ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES
ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES OF ANY AMERIKA AND ANY PLANET. BEGONE ALL HUMAN
SPECIES. KILL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES. EARTH,
KILL ALL MALIGNANT HUMAN SPECIES."  That seems doltish to me, unreflective,
ill-considered.  Or this: "missing stromatolite the pictures are coming
perfectly along. i've been inntrol, youcan bet i've ben in control, hehh heh
heh not like now but geere or gettingewhre, the packets are ipping from me"
I mean, what's the point of reading this? What am I supposed to be getting
from that?  I guess I have to respect your process, which strikes me as a
kind of Jackson-Pollack-does-computer-poetry. The result of that process is
what I reserve the right to express frustration with.  By comparison,
jodi.org is much more interesting & addresses "the issues" much more
eloquently.

My main point anyway -- and perhaps the one I should have stuck with-- is
that it should not be out-of-bounds to express frustration with your poetry
on this list or any other that you post it to.  That's part of the game,
right?

Without bitterness,
Aaron

the process.  I can't even begin to stop the process.  I am so happy to =
have the electronic gag taken from my mouth via the Buffalo Demon =
because I have non-confrontational things to say about happenings in =

 Alan, I am so sorry.  You are not posting enough.  Please post =
absolutely everything you are writing, because what you have to say is =
someow necessary.  I know that now. It is somehow absolutely necessary =
and now I am somehow understanding.  I am so happy to have the gag taken =
away, and I will report it to List Adminsitration if the gag is (for =

The next edition of my magazine, A Chide's Alphabet, will also have a strong
feature on the new German language poets, particularly those from
Switzerland, Austria and German-speaking Rumania. That is, when I recover
from my current fit of lassitude, which will probably be about October!

Subject:      foward of an article on ethnic repression in China
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

My brother, currently living in China & studying
Uyghur, sent me this today and I thought it might be
of interest to folks. I think the baning of the
teaching of the Uyghur language from Xinjiang
University is quite disturbing, and, perhaps,
representative of the more overt ways in which the
worldwide "war on terror" is also being waged
linguistically. It's still dangerous to be a poet in
some parts of the world...

China: An Excuse for Ethnic Repression

Martin Regg Cohn

Jul. 28, 2002

KASHGAR, China CROWDS OF devout Muslims file toward
Aidkah Mosque, its mustard-yellow tiles glinting in
the
setting sun. Drawn by the call to evening prayers,
bearded men in skullcaps pour into the adjoining
square.

A few blocks away, People's Square draws only a
handful
of orthodox Maoists - party cadres, undercover police
and soldiers in olive drab - who stroll by the
colossal
statue of Mao Zedong, founder of Communist China.

The story of Kashgar has long been a tale of these two

town squares, where Muslims and Maoists rarely cross
paths. In China's remote northwestern province of
Xinjiang, 3,400 kilometres from Beijing, the two
solitudes keep their distance.

But in the wake of Sept.11, the bleak concrete expanse

of People's Square has become the setting for a series

of show trials.

Accused Muslim terrorists are being hauled here, under

the watchful gaze of Mao's 18-metre-high statue, and
sentenced to death.

Their crime: plotting to revive a separate Republic of

East Turkestan, as this sprawling region was known
before the Communists reconquered it a half-century
ago.

Adding muscle to the campaign, thousands of soldiers
have been redeployed to this border region and a
police
dragnet has rounded up more than 3,000 local Muslims
since Sept. 11, in addition to the dozens killed so
far, human rights groups say.

The upheaval is nothing new for Kashgar, which has
been
a locus of geopolitical ambitions since ancient times.

A millennium ago, it was a trading centre for camel
caravans plying the Silk Road from China to the
Mediterranean. In the 19th century, it was a listening

post for British and Russian spies mapping out
the "Great Game" for control of neighbouring
Afghanistan.

Today, the winding alleys of the bazaar overflow with
donkey carts and teahouses, hat makers and butchers.
But the old foreign consulates are kitschy hotels and
the city's romantic image has faded into history.

Now, a climate of fear hangs over Kashgar, fallout
from
the global war against terror. The Muslims of Xinjiang
-
 7 million indigenous Uighurs (pronounced Wey-gurs),
who have long resented the flood of Han Chinese
settlers who have made them a minority in this
province
of 15 million people - may be paying a higher price
than anywhere else in the Islamic world.

Amnesty International points out that Xinjiang is the
only region in China where political prisoners are
regularly put to death. It documented 190 executions
from 1997 to 1999, and all the signs point to the
pattern continuing.

The current "Strike Hard" campaign targets "hardened
minority splittists, suspected violent criminal
terrorists or religious extremists," according to
government reports. Police in Xinjiang regularly
raid "illegal religious centres" - a euphemism for
unauthorized mosques - and arrest worshippers.

After years of foreign criticism, China is making no
apologies for its homegrown war against groups like
the
Front for the Liberation of East Turkestan and the
Islamic Uighur party.

"We find it hard to understand and a pity that some
people don't believe our efforts to fight terrorism
are
part of the international campaign," says Xinjiang's
Communist party secretary, Wang Lequan.

Meeting foreign correspondents recently, he warned the

West not to use a double standard. Wang said his
intelligence reports showed that 1,000 ethnic Uighurs
were trained by Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network in
Afghanistan and that about 100 of them were captured
on
their return to China.

A January report by China's cabinet office cited 162
deaths in more than 200 terrorist incidents over the
past decade, though most dated to the early 1990s. The

report claimed "bin Laden terrorists and Taliban
leaders" were funnelling "a fabulous sum of money for
the training of the East Turkestan terrorists."

Xinjiang officials also said several pro-Beijing imams

were assassinated last year.

As part of the renewed propaganda offensive, Du
Jianxi,
chief of Xinjiang's dreaded Public Security Bureau,
boasted that the crackdown was "smashing the bloated
pride of violent terrorists."

Visiting reporters were treated to a demonstration by
special-forces soldiers who punched the air and
smashed
boards with kung fu kicks.

The stepped-up police presence - outside mosques, at
train stations, in the bazaars - has cast a chill over

Kashgar. With informers lurking everywhere and
journalists frequently followed by the police, Uighur
dissidents live in fear of being found out.

"Xinjiang used to be its own country before the
Chinese
took it over, and we want to recreate that time," says

one Kashgar Muslim in his 30s, whose almond-shaped
eyes
and high cheekbones - classic features of the Uighurs
-
set him apart from the Han.

"But I don't dare talk about it," he says, looking
furtively over his shoulder, "because if you talk a
little, the Chinese cut off your arm, and if you talk
too much, they kill you.

His talk of severed limbs is a figure of speech. But
fears of execution are hardly exaggerated.

In the oasis town of Khotan, 430 kilometres southeast
of Kashgar, seven accused separatists were paraded at
a "public sentencing rally" in a local sports stadium
in October. One of them - Metrozi Metthoti, 34,
accused
of "separatism and storing weapons" - was led away to
be shot, according to Amnesty International.

Near the stadium, in a carpet shop inside Khotan's
bazaar, local Muslims grow palpably tense when talking

about the latest round of executions. Sitting cross-
legged on a rug over cups of tea, a dealer who calls
himself Taher motions with his hands to show his
throat
being slit if he talks too much.

"If I told you the truth," he whispers, "they would
cut
out my tongue."

But Taher scoffs at the government's description of
local Uighurs as Islamic fundamentalists. Far from
being religious puritans adhering to the rigid Wahhabi

school of Islam, most Uighurs in Xinjiang cling to the

more mystical and tolerant Sufi strain.

Uighur women often walk Kashgar's streets unveiled,
wearing short skirts and high heels, without fear of
harassment from fellow Muslims. Alcohol consumption is

commonplace despite Islamic injunctions against it.

Unlike the hard-line Wahhabis, who often despise the
West, people here commonly look to America as a model
of democracy and pluralism. Their wrath is directed
toward Beijing, not Washington.

"We're not Muslim fanatics and we don't hate the West.

We just resent the Chinese," says Mohammed, a young
tour guide. "Actually, we admire the West because we
also want to have freedom and democracy and human
rights."

In government schools, female teachers are prohibited
from wearing veils on the job and male teachers must
shave their beards. Religious instruction is unheard
of
and Muslim students are often served hot lunches
during
the holy month of Ramadan as an inducement to break
the
obligatory daytime fast.

Civil servants are required to stay at their desks at
prayer time and are barred from bringing the Qur'an to

work.

Broadcasts of sermons are forbidden and signs posted
in
most mosques prohibit anyone under 18 from entering
for
regular prayers.

Anyone with a Uighur name finds it almost impossible
to
obtain a passport in Xinjiang - even for the haj, the
pilgrimage to Mecca expected of every able-bodied
Muslim. Two months ago, the Uighur language was banned

from Xinjiang University.

As part of its political campaign to control Islamic
clerics, the Chinese government has ordered 8,000
imams
to attend compulsory "patriotic re-education" classes
where they learn about "anti-splittism" laws.

The classes are organized by the notorious Production
Corps, a powerful state organization with a 100,000-
strong militia that has recruited millions of ethnic
Chinese to settle in Xinjiang over the past 50 years.

According to the official Xinhua news agency, the
lessons reinforce "correct ideological understanding
and improve the political qualities of the religious
leaders."

That two-pronged approach to religious repression - a
ban on Islamic instruction in schools and a
requirement
that imams be coached in government seminars - prompts

many parents to teach their children behind closed
doors.

"They take our teenage children and shove Chinese
propaganda down their throats so that they lose our
own
Uighur language and culture," says one Kashgar
businessman, adding plaintively: "I want to tell you
what is in my heart, but I dare not tell anyone."

Many analysts are puzzled by Beijing's determination
to
apply massive force to a relatively minor resistance,
arguing that the Uighurs are more interested in
defending their cultural identity than promoting
Islamic fundamentalism.

As for terrorism, Chinese officials publicly
downplayed
the threat before Sept. 11, preferring to talk up
foreign investment in oil and gas.

Their biggest selling point was that no bombs had gone

off in the last five years.

"The Chinese definition of terrorism is different from

our definition," says Jean-Pierre Cabestan, head of
the
Hong Kong-based French Centre for Research on
Contemporary China.

"It's an excuse to crack down on Xinjiang, because any

terrorist actions in Xinjiang in the last few years
have been minimal."

But Beijing believes it has a geopolitical imperative
for wiping out any traces of dissent: Despite its size
-
 one-sixth of China's total land mass - Xinjiang is
best known for the nuclear test sites and vast oil and

gas reserves that dot its deserts.

The war against terror is an opportunity for
consolidation.

"They're certainly using 9/11 as an excuse to clamp
down," says Paul George, an independent consultant who

wrote a report on Islamic unrest in Xinjiang for the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service that found the
separatist movement to be weak and isolated.

"Who cares? The greater goal (of the West) is to
prevent terror and crush that force in Afghanistan.
And
they (Beijing) are getting away with it."

Since Sept. 11, Western diplomats stopped criticizing
China's repression of Uighur dissidents, for fear of
losing Beijing's support in the broader anti-terrorist

war.

Mary Robinson, the United Nations human-rights
commissioner, has publicly lamented the West's sudden
silence.

"Because of the coalition to curb terrorism,
governments are not as prepared to raise the issue of
human rights," the former Irish president said on a
visit to Beijing.

"There is a serious situation of imprisonment,
detention and torture...bearing down very hard on the
Uighur population."

But the tensions in Xinjiang are only partly related
to
political repression. Much of the Uighur discontent
flows from economic and social grievances.

The Han dominate senior positions in government and
commerce and live in modern, if antiseptic, high-rise
towers that have sprung up in the provincial capital,
Urumqi. Uighurs still live in mud-brick dwellings that

ooze character but can't retain heat during Xinjiang's

frigid winters.

"The Chinese are very strong, but we Uighurs are
weak,"
says Ahmed, a shopkeeper in Kashgar. "Always, the top
guy in an organization is Chinese. They have the power

and we don't."

Racism is a perennial problem.

Lin Yong, a Han driver in Urumqi, explains proudly
that
his parents settled in Xinjiang in 1959 and made the
province what it is today. Without Han labour and
leadership, he says, the region would be as dirt poor
and disorderly as Kashgar's old city.

"The Uighurs don't know the meaning of hard work," Lin

complains, and then goes on to repeat a slur
masquerading as fact: "The rural people are so poor
that every year during Ramadan, a child dies of hunger

in every family."

Such ignorance of the Uighurs is typical among the
Han,
almost none of whom can speak the local language. So,
too, is Lin's steadfast support for the government
crackdown.

"The Strike Hard campaign is nipping this rebellion in

the bud," he says. "These executions and
incarcerations
strike fear in the heart of the Uighurs."

Against this backdrop, resistance to Chinese rule
takes
many forms, some quite subtle. The loyalties of a
Uighur often can be discerned by how he sets his
watch:
to official Beijing time or to unofficial "Kashgar
time," which is two hours later.

With thousands of kilometres separating Kashgar from
Beijing, central Chinese time produces absurd results:

traditional noon prayers would have to be scheduled
for
mid-afternoon. Which is why most observant Muslims
quietly keep Kashgar time.

The clash of clocks is most obvious in the main square

surrounding Aidkah Mosque. The Persian-style clock
tower erected beside the 600-year-old mosque has
stopped working and no one has bothered to repair it.

Frozen in time, the idled clock allows local Muslims
to
remain defiantly oblivious to Beijing time - without
being called to account in nearby People's Square.

Aaron,

If people must "be allowed to object to something they read on the
list," which seems obviously to be true, than those who object to
posts by those who object to something they read on the list must
also be allowed (as well as those who object to those who object to
those who object, etc etc.).

I'd estimate that far fewer than a hundred people post to this list
in any given month, but there are somewhere around a 1,000 of us out
here receiving whatever is sent to the list. We each have our own
reasons for having signed up and remaining on the list. We each have
our own idea of what's useful and interesting. We each have our own
way of dealing with whatever we think is not useful or interesting.

If, for some reason, you feel it is important to read everything you
receive from this list despite your very clear sense that some things
you receive from this list are not worth reading, it's a up to you to
figure out how to deal with the obvious discrepancy. No one is
forcing you to read everything you receive from this list. If you
choose to object to the posts you find to be a problem, fine. By now
it should be clear that your continued objection to these posts is
not sufficient reason for them to be stopped. This being the case,
you shouldn't be surprised when others express their frustrations
with your continued posts on this subject and decide in turn to make
their objections known to the list. That's just common sense.
There're a lot of us out here reading the list and we each have
different things that tick us off.

I've seen a lot of things on this list I don't care about or for, no
matter how much I may care about & for the overall existence of the
list and people on it. If they're clearly marked, I don't read
announcements for readings in cities I know I won't be in at the
time. When someone who's work I have not previously liked, sends in
an announcement of a publication, I don't read it (again, if it's
clearly marked). There've been plenty of substantive discussions, as
well as silly chatter, that didn't make any difference to me at all &
after I realized that, I didn't read them either, regardless of how
interesting these exchanges may have been to the participants and
other readers on the list.

Far from being an unworkable rule for dealing with this or other
high-volume lists, "Skip what you don't like" may be the most
effective way to deal with the 30-50 e-mail messages a day that
arrive from the list.

Bests,

An early Vandercook cylinder press is available, free for the taking,
in Decatur, Illinois. It received no bids in an e-bay auction a few
weeks ago.

Although the manufacturer's plate is gone, Fritz Klinke of NA
Graphics believes this press to be one of the Vandercook Rigid Bed
Composing Room Cylinders made in the very early years of the 20th
century, or perhaps a precursor to one of these, when Ol' Man
Vandercook was testing his designs.

Fritz says there were 3 models of the Rigid Bed: "The smallest was
the #17 with a bed size of 17x31 1/2, weight 1200 lbs. Next was #25,
bed size 25 x 32 1/2, weight 1600 lbs, and the third was #26, with
the same bed size as previous, but weight of 1300 lbs. The cabinet
was extra."  From the owner's measurements I can't tell which model
number it is, though I believe it's either the 25 or 26.

Hefty, eh? But the owner says it's in a garage on cement flooring,
with a large cement parking area right outside.

If I had space in my basement, and a day to give to the move, and a
favor due from my brother, I'd go get it myself. But I don't have any
of those, and my brother is getting tired of helping me rescue
letterpress equipment (and my wife wonders where we're going to put
the washer and dryer).

The owner is in the process of selling the house but a sale is not
imminent; still, the ideal would be to move the press fairly soon,
possibly sometime in August.

I have a picture I can e-mail anyone who's interested, along with the
owner's name and e-mail address.

THE SURPRISE BRONZE

If you open my book
there has been a mistake
it would be better
if you read the newspaper

the blind mother
the welder father
paying for the lessons
the surprise bronze

I picked up The Web
and the Rock again
the other day and
it held up very well

I have a question for you
what the hell happened
I see you around
what's your story.



----

The first widely available collection of Malmude's work brings together
work from his 1973 Adventures in Poetry book, his 1981 Shell Press
chapbook, and his 1997 Goodbye Books limited edition letterpress book. A
contemporary of Bernadette Mayer, Lewis Warsh, Ted Greenwald, Lorenzo
Thomas, and Larry Fagin, Malmude has been quietly gathering some of the
most moving poems to come out of New York in recent memory. Of _I Got to
Know_, Ron Silliman said on this list that "Malmude, with just three books
over a 25 year period, is one of the most underpublished and
underappreciated poets of my generation. Just when you've nearly forgotten
about him, something like this comes out and nearly takes the top of your
head off."

Several months ago, someone posted information about a magazine that, as I
remember it, was going to devote five or six issues to essays on language
poetry.  I thought I saved the post, and meant to subscribe to the magazine,
but I lost the post--and my server started rejecting UB Poetics stuff for
some unknown reason and it took me a while to get back on.  Anywaze, I hope
someone will let me know what that magazine is and where I can subscribe to
it.  One of these days I really really really intend to update my essay on
schools of poetry, and want to get as much dope on language poetry as I can
in order to maximize akuracy.  If anyone else can guide me to studies of
language poetry as opposed to effusions about it, I'd much appreciate it,
too.

                        Thanks, Bob G.

I've got to say there's a certain lack of a sense of humor here.  These
"attacks" on Alan's stuff strike me as wildly funny.  They seem to be poetry
responses in a New York School vein.

Yes, Alan posts a lot of material.  Some of it works really well, some less
so.  But it's all worth taking a look at it.  And if you can't stand it, hit
delete.

And by the way, my journal, 88, a print journal, is publishing 4 of Alan's
pieces in October.  We saw them here on the list and wanted them for the
issue.

Ian,

Just to clarify, I think it's wonderful that Alan posts freely, and I think
88 is a fine journal.  Kudos to you.

I was only trying to make the point that it's okay to criticize Alan's
poetry in the forum in which it's posted.  One might take issue with the
substance of that criticism, but not with the *fact* of that criticism--
i.e., there are no sacred cows, and responses should be welcome.  In fact, I
don't think Alan feel harangued.  If he does, I hope he'll say something!

By the way, a correction to my second post of yesterday: "Viable process
does equal viable product" should read "Viable process does *not* equal
viable product."   (That was my opinion yesterday, but Wystan Curnow has
been enlightening me offlist about the difference between process and
procedure, and the possibilities of looking at/ critiquing the art-making
system as a whole. I confess this is not something I have given a whole lot
of thought to, and I'm glad to learn about it.  I'm also glad to think, Ian,
about whether or not I have New York School assumptions. We all, of course,
have some kind of starting point.)

I think the discussion of Alan's posting has gone to embarrassing extremes.

On the positive side, Alan did explain his methodology and some discussion
of it took place. But a question such as, "Alan, could you explain your
methodology?" would have worked better than putting him in a defensive
position

Also on the positive side, the controversy seems to be generating interest
in his work. The trouble is, too many of the responses sound like something
you'd expect to find on Jerry Springer instead of this List.

I support any poet's right to post material on this List. I can't find the
work of many of the excellent poets I see posting here in my area's chain or
independent bookstores. If this is where they have to "publish," so be it.
If I don't want to read it, I can use the delete button, which also helps
maintain fine motor coordination.

I've tried to place some of the responses I've read in the context of my own
life: 50  years of Tourette Syndrome that resulted in discrimination in jobs
and social life that parallels what many African-Americans and Latinos have
experienced; two cases of Hodgkins Disease by age 25, several years before
the cure rate was 90% ; a day job in which I routinely risked being on the
wrong end of a drive-by shooting. (And this is only the surface...) Given
this background, Alan's posting is hardly the worst thing that ever happened
to me.

If Alan's posting is the worst thing that ever happened to the people who
object to it, they have either been very fortunate or are very unfortunate.

The tone of many posters to this list is a turn-off.  Why become a poet if
only to squabble with other poets?  Did anyone sign on to sift through daily
bitterness?  Have more respect for the people here.  Call me humorless: we
could and deserve to be more.

I agree, and the tone of my own responses, unfortunately,  has taken a
downhill turn. I don't need other poets to write poetry, but I joined this
list to gain contacts and engage in substantive discussion about poetry
instead of vituperative diatribes over minutiae. I assume that everybody on
this list got here because they have a talent for writing poetry and a
serious interest in furthering it. As such, I try to give everybody respect
for their talent and their work, even if it's not to my personal taste. Some
of the comments I've seen posted here over the past few months would get a
person stomped in the parking lot of a biker bar. This has never happened on
the other literary lists I've subscribed to. So, yeah, how about giving each
other more respect and checking the day's frustrations at the door?

does anyone know whether Erica Hunt's ARCADE contains all of her earlier
LOCAL HISTORY?  (My recollection is that Erica told me it does, but that's a
few years ago now.)

and if not: any idea whether LOCAL HISTORY is still obtainable (I'd need
around 40 copies--it's for a course)?

_Arcade_ is a different text: a collaboration with visual artist Alison
Saar. It does not replicate _Local History_. _Local History_ is fab to
teach; I've had students write poems/letters addressed to the piece called
"Correspondence Theory" and gotten some great work. It looks like _Local
History_ is available through Small Press Distribution.
Good luck,
Kathy Lou

this is quite fascinating.  of course i am a die-hard sondheim fan, but i
find these periodic outbursts very interesting; what buttons is he pushing?
something about sexuality?  an investment in the "well-crafted poem" that
is threatened by the nonstop outpouring?  fear of abjection?  of language
as a bodily fluid?

folks,

anyone on the list have any dealings with Peter Lang publishing?  here's the
reason i ask: a friend of mine had her dissertation accepted for publication
by Lang.  part of the deal was that she was supposed to pay for typesetting
the book (a service that they happen to provide)...  that right there seemed
very odd to me.  she then asked me to do the typesetting, and they have been
very difficult to work with, changing specifications and demanding multiple
revisions, to the point where it seems they seem (to me) to be intentionally
sabotaging the project.

anyway, i was wondering if anyone had any experience with them, similar to
ours or otherwise.  also, is it normal for academic publishers to require
payments from their authors?  i know times are tough, but we used to call
that "vanity publishing"

thanks
