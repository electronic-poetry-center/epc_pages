I've been sympathetically following the tragic death of Emma Bernstein
and wonder why "quietist" poetry (and prose, I suppose) seem/s to
better express grief. The one exception I've discovered so far is Mary
Jo Bang's "Elegy." Who else am I missing?

Additionally, reflecting only slightly upon Ron Silliman's

FINAL DAY OF EXHIBIT
Buckminster Fuller: Starting with the Universe is a fascinating mix of utopian vision and organic pragmatism, combining models, sketches, and other artifacts -- many on view for the first time -- represent six decades of the artist's integrated approach to housing, transportation, communication, and cartography.  The exhibition features numerous models of Fuller's projects including his famous geodesic dome.  Fuller's extensive connections with Chicago are also highlighted through photographs and documents from his years spent living, teaching, and working in the city.

Bookworm had a four or five part series called An American Bookworm in
Paris.

You can visit the website: http://www.kcrw.com/etc/programs/bw and then at
the bottom there is a link "More past shows" It should not be too far back,
but you can also search for it.

It's pretty good and has about 15 or more contemporary French writers, many
of whom would fit with the poetics of this list.

Hi, Mary Jo,

Here are a few recommendations, re: mourning & poetics.

1. Inventions of Farewell, edited by Sandra Gilbert.  That's an anthology of elegies and elegiac poetics/poetry.

2. Poetry of Mourning, by Jahan Ramazani.  Scholarly study.

3. Both of the above are v. good for twentieth-century Anglo-American poetry & poetics of loss, but neither really begins to address postmodern poetics.  If you're interested, you could also consider this book chapter: "'The Brevities': Formal Mourning, Transgression & Postmodern American Elegies", in _The World in Time and Space_ (Talisman House, 2002), 122-46.

Best wishes,
Scott Howard

Have you checked out Jennifer Bartlett's book, "Derivative of the Moving Image" lately.

See the poems "Elegy for the Trees" and "Going to Yugoslavia" -- particularly the former.

I would not consider JB a Quietist poet in any sense. I am sure there are many others who express grief well, but not all of them do it in a narrative manner.

"Each of the prints here is unique; each is the result of print, print
error, borderline and uncontrollable phenomena. Most of them originate
from work done with the aid of Poser and other 3d modeling programs. The
mannequins represent snapshots of distorted dynamic movement, movements
real bodies in real spaces could never do, unless constrained by torture,
dismemberment, fantasm, sexuality, or (other) uncomfortable elements
within the imaginary - bridging the real, ascending, descending. I see
every print as an entire world; if it doesn't work alone, it won't work in
conjunction. I also see them as ruins - of fragile-analogic bodies, of the
digital world, of memory. Ruins are fascinating; no matter how minimal,
there always seems to be enough there, never enough there, never there."

Subject:      cross multiplication

we live in an age of rapid cross multiplication.

in math, cross multiplication between two sets of things results in a new
set that pairs each element of the first set with each element of the second
set.

{1, 2, 3} x {4, 5, 6} = {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), ( 2,5), (2,6), (3,4),
(3,5), (3,6)}

the first two sets are one-dimensional. the cross product is two
dimensional. the cross product of two sets has more dimensions.

the internet accelerates the processes of cultural cross multiplication.
poetry x programming; poetry x spam; poetry x lots of things. because the
internet is a vast network. a network is a bunch of nodes in relation to
other nodes. and the relations grow between different nodes. and new nodes
form out of unions of groups of nodes. as the lettrist poet isadore isou put
it, "Each poet will integrate everything into Everything".

given a finite set of plain old numbers, it makes sense to talk about the
greatest one or the least one. but it doesn't make much sense to speak of
the greatest or least in {(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), ( 2,5), (2,6), (3,4),
(3,5), (3,6)}.

we can talk about the point which is the greatest distance from (0,0), or
something like that, but it doesn't mean simply 'the greatest'.

similarly, in a situation of cultural cross multiplication, standards that
might loosely apply to, say, poetry, might not so easily apply to (poetry,
programming).

so we get a situation where no one knows what is greatest or least. because
there really is no greatest or least in a situation of cross multiplication.

Hi, Mary Jo,

Here are a few recommendations, re: mourning & poetics.

1. Inventions of Farewell, edited by Sandra Gilbert.=A0 That's an anthology=
 of elegies and elegiac poetics/poetry.

2. Poetry of Mourning, by Jahan Ramazani.=A0 Scholarly study.

3.
Both of the above are v. good for twentieth-century Anglo-American
poetry & poetics of loss, but neither really begins to address
postmodern poetics.=A0 If you're interested, you could also consider this
book chapter: "'The Brevities': Formal Mourning, Transgression &

Dear TSky Friends,

Two items that we think might interest you:

1) TSky Press Fall 2009/Spring 2010 subscriptions are now available.

$60 for six books w/free shipping
(vs. $103.94 from Amazon, or $107 from SPD)

Yes, you read the above correctly. $60 will get you five paperbacks and one
chapbook w/ free shipping. & Yes, you'll save around $45.

Please visit our catalog at http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/catalog.html
to order online or pay by check. (THIS OFFER IS LIMITED TO 100 SUBSCRIBERS.)

All first books. All from women writers. Which excites us no end. Although
we have always been committed to publishing both new writers and women
writers, the 2009/10 subscription series really puts our money where our
collective mouth is. Fall 2009 books include Ana Bozicevic's full-length
poetry collection, _Stars of the Night Commute_; Traci O Connor's book of
short fictions, _Recipes for Endangered Species_; and Emily Toder's poetry
chapbook, _Brushes With_; Spring 2010 titles include Joanna Ruocco's book of
short fictions, _Man's Companions_; Kim Gek Lin Short's lyric novella, _The
Bugging Watch and Other Exhibits_; and Shelly Taylor's book of interlocking
short fictions / prose poems, _Black-Eyed Heifer_.


2) Andrew Zornoza's _Where I Stay_ and Gordon Massman's _The Essential
Numbers_ are also now available.

In the process of constantly disappearing, the unhinged, unmoored and
unnamed narrator of WHERE I STAY travels through a cracked North America,
stalked by his own future self and the whispers of a distant love. From
Arco, Idaho to Mexico City, he flees along the highways and dirt roads of a
landscape filled with characters in transition: squatters, survivalists,
prostitutes, drug runners, skinheads, border guards and con-men. WHERE I
STAY is a meditation on desperation, identity, geography, memory, and love-a
story about endurance, about the empty spaces in ourselves, about the new
possibilities we find only after we have lost everything. "Refreshing,
pitch-perfect kind of steering that is innovative not only for the genre it
might get called into, but for experiential and language-focused texts of
every stripe."--BLAKE BUTLER. "A gifted journey through borderlands between
text and image, glassy prose and suggestively indirect prose poem, facts and
fictions, sanity and the other thing"--LANCE OLSEN.
http://www.tarpaulinsky.com/Press/Zornoza/index.html

from THE ESSENTIAL NUMBERS: "1715": "It is unimportant to me whether anyone
reads these poems / or their assessment of them should they, I do not care
under / whose name they are published, nor could I care less what / literary
critics say about them, praise or condemnation, / nothing could be more
vapid than some academic advanc- / ing his career on my efforts or within
institutionally accept- / able parameters pushing my reputation this way or
that, / most contemporary poetry is shit as is the industry that sur- /
rounds it and I want no part of it, if I am harsh so be it, if / I am angry
then that is life, if I have hurt my consanguineous / they are
co-conspirators in their pain, nothing in this work / bears false witness
nor have I broken one commandment, / I am a decent man imbued with a
religious spirit and cap- / able of love, I have noticed the world is full
of cowards."

On Being Married to a Man Who Is Married to

I have heard it said that an intellectual is a polygamist, for s/he may not
just be wedded to a human being whose needs and desires must be given some
consideration, but also be similarly attached to books, to academic
activities, to the endless pursuit of knowledge. These two commitments do
not always submit to each other peacefully and may become the cause of
serious agony for the married intellectual. As it is for men who are
academics, so it is for their female counterparts. Perhaps, viewed from the
perspective of women who are academics, the conflicting demands are more
intense in their own case than in the case of men who are academics. In
spite of the changes brought into the family by gender sensitization in
modern life, women still have to make the home, catering for their husbands
and children. And this does not excuse them from living up to the demands o=
f
their jobs: as academics they still have to carry out research, read books,
teach students, supervise projects, publish articles or books, and engage i=
n
other professional activities. Indeed, as Virginia Woolf writes in A Room o=
f
One=92s Own the woman as a (literary artist) needs a space of her own,
economic freedom, and freedom to use her mind, in order to function
productively and meaningfully. It is certainly not an easy thing for her to
have a =93room of her own=94 in the space of her husband when she functions=
 as a
scholar. As a male scholar, I imagine, therefore, that it is not very easy
for my female colleagues.

As a male scholar married to a woman and to my books, what does my
=93polygamy=94 orchestrate for me in my family life? Am I not like the man
invited by his chi and his father-in-law to work on their farms on the same
day at the same time? If I ignore my father-in-law and decide to work on my
chi=92s farm, my father-in-law would be mad with me and withdraw his daught=
er
(at least, as culturally permitted in the Igbo society in which I was born
and raised). If I ignore my chi and decide to work on my father-in-law=92s
farm, my chi would also be mad with me and take my life. So, my tragedy is
located somewhere between the possible loss of a wife and the loss of my
life. And, being a faithful husband (oh yes I am!) I don=92t want to lose m=
y
wife I swear, neither do I want to lose my life and leave her a widow!

It is 2.00 am and I am in my study, working at the computer again, fighting
back the hands of sleep that have been trying to shut my eyes for me. I hav=
e
to finish reading an article sent to me for assessment and feed in my repor=
t
on the e-page of an electronic journal. Deadlines are deadlines, especially
for electronic gatekeepers. Moreover, I have to prove to the editor of the
journal that scholars based in Africa as not as =93dead=94 as the world is =
made
to believe. So, I am here, not really in my study anymore, but in
cyberspace, mutually hallucinating with other cyborgs (thanks to Mel Gibson
for that idea). I don=92t know whether I am asleep or awake again, just as =
I
can=92t say whether I am really Here or There, whether I am real or unreal!
Well, in my nowhereness, I see her on the screen of my laptop, first as a
pop-up, then as an emoticon. She is snoring and her snores are angry words.
A software now, she jumps out of the screen and gets installed on my mind
the real computer. I am browsing my mind now, my laptop has vanished and my
mind is saying to me =85

Are you real? Are you really here? Are you really unreal? OK, she is your
art now, she that you cannot browse. She is the message now the medium , sh=
e
that cannot give you a deadline. Are you not just another brand of
falsehood? Sometimes when she needs your attention, you have a book in your
hand or you are sitting before a computer, and you must chase that idea
through the paragraphs and pages of some fields of thought. Sometimes she i=
s
kept waiting in the bedroom, and you are trying to finish writing that
article to beat a deadline. Sometimes the food kept for you on the dining
table =96 because you could not join the family at mealtime =96 gets cold a=
nd
you have to eat it quietly like a dog, afraid to complain, so as not to
start a war. After all, if you didn=92t want it cold, you should have come =
to
eat it warm!

Books and books and books everywhere. Books on the shelves. Books on the
floor. Books on the table. Books in cartons. Books sitting on books. Books
inside books, to mark where you have to return to, after angrily going to
find out what she wants you to come and see. Books in the study. Books in
the bedroom. Books and books and more books arriving. You cannot provide
more money for weekend shopping, for you say the pay is low, the tax is
high, and you have children=92s fees to pay soon, but you can=92t remove yo=
ur
eyes from books. You buy more and more books and smuggle them into the
house! Sometimes you claim you got the books for free, even before she
accuses you with her eyes. You keep buying books, sometimes three or four
copies of the same book. Some copies for yourself; some copies for your
students to borrow and disfigure through photocopying or sheer
carelessness.

This conference and that seminar and those workshops =85 where you shop for
ideas on how to stay away from her! Absentee husband, you nickname is
Professor Awayness, for you are busy providing awareness away from her and
the children. Sometimes a week. Sometimes two weeks. And when you are
returning from this one, you are leaving for that one. Sometimes you
trans-conference or trans-seminar, after all, what=92s the point coming hom=
e
to say you are leaving soon?

And your way of thinking! Haven=92t you been hardened by all those crazy id=
eas
and tortured language that communicates them? So, what do we have here: a
human who can really sleep when he is asleep, play when it is playtime, and
do stupid things when fun demands it, without caring so much about what thi=
s
or that theory says? You are discussing a point with her. Just a little
argument and you take off as if you are in one of those crazy listserv
debates, quoting this book and that book you have read. You see; that=92s a
symptom of the illness that I mentioned earlier! Can you similarly quote
her, your wife? No, not all! Has she got quotable ideas? It is books that
tell you what to do. It is books that are right enough decide a little
exchange between a husband and a wife!

Yes, she needs a husband, not necessarily an academic hero. But you think
that being an academic hero counts much in satisfying those needs of hers.
And that=92s one problem: who determines her needs: you, your books, or she=
?
She wants you to include her in your scheme of things, if not the main
programme of your life. And you are uncomfortable about this, very. You
think your academic life and pursuit could be hindered, if not ruined, by
your focus on a human wife or family. Didn=92t you even once whisper to
yourself: a writer married is a writer marred? Another idea you picked from
those crazy associates of yours, those apostles of aloneness!

And now you have discovered another opportunity for keeping her lonely (or
another opportunity has discovered you the ready tool!): the Internet, with
all those blogs you must update, those emails you must read and respond to,
those chats (sometimes three or four going on simultaneously), those
skirmishes on listservs you must engage in, those downloads and uploads tha=
t
increase the weight of your mental luggage. So, has she not suddenly become
a widow, an =93Internet widow,=94 as Clifford Stoll calls it in Silicon Sna=
ke
Oil?

At the mention of the word =93widow=94, I wake up and I am right on my feet=
. My
wife opens the door of my study and walks in, fear written on her face.
=93Why were you screaming?=94
=93Screaming? Did I scream?=94
=93Of course, you did! I came to find out what was wrong. And don=92t you t=
hink
it=92s time for you to come to the bedroom and lie down?=94
And, suddenly, there=92s an electricity outage. 4.00 am. Indeed, it is time=
 to
go to bed.

 Quietist poetry: I've never heard of the term. A whimper, I suppose, is mo=
re nuanced than a shout, but some very good not so quiet poems have been po=
ems of mourning. Consider Kaddish. Ginsberg isn't exaclty quiet. Nor is Syl=
via Plath, or any of the confessional poets. Perhaps quietist poetry is a w=
ay of whispering with a megaphone.=20

I'm soon moving to the Bay Area and would like to hear about the poetry
community there (reading series, bookstores). I especially want to hear from
poets in their 20s and poets who run small presses. Does anyone wish to shed
some light for me?

xoxo,

Evan

It seems to me like a lot of Notley's work is about grief--starting with a =
number of the poems in Mysteries of Small Houses, including "Towards a Defi=
nition" and "The Person That You Were Will Be Replaced," the longer poem "F=
rom the Beginning," which was published as a chapbook by Owl Press, and the=
 epic The Descent of Alette.=A0 Actually, every time I hear Notley read, I =
hear grieving in her work. What's really remarkable is how many different w=
ays she's found of engaging with it in her poems.

Do Tell, a new festival in Hendersonville, NC, will feature poets
Thomas Meyer, Laura Hope-Gill, Sebastian Matthews, Thomas Rain Crowe,
and myself. It will also feature a passel of storytellers, masters of
Jack Tale, Cherokee lore, Lincoln apocrypha, myths of St.George and
the dragon, and sundry other bits of hermetic hearsay. It all gets
underway next Saturday, July 11th, at 11:00 am.

If you're not from around here, Hendersonville is just a few miles
south of Asheville, a cultural crossroads situated between the Blue
Ridge and the Great Smokies in the mountains of Western North
Carolina. It's well worth a visit - especially this time of year, when
temperatures in the flatlands reach into the high nineties. Not to
gloat, but our nights are still in the fifties, and the porch
thermometer tells me it's 75 F at 5:30 post meridian.

Check the website at http://dotellfestival.org for the full schedule
and more information about the performers.

And do come on up and see us!

When i first heard of quietest poetry i thought it meant the language and
post language writers as they=92re so quiet &  absent from everything
happening off the page of their work

(Ironically if not a =93lyric self=94 perhaps more like the lyric ego??---I
don=92t know-though involvement with writer and words on page to the exclus=
ion
of the world in many ways beyond the immediate self=97seems to be a major p=
art
of both language and what siliman calls quietist poetry



Actually there is a real Quietist Poetry, and a historical Roman Catholic
heresy called Quietism, which is the practice and belief in attainting a
state of perfection during life, a state which is sinless and is found
through a passivity and contemplation in which the emptying of the mind and
annihilation of the self make possible a perfect union with God.  Quietism
as a movement was very strong and widespread in Italy, Spain and France in
the 17th Century and its influence has been found in writers who weren=92t
directly Quietist yet share many of the beliefs and express them in their
writings=97St Theresa of Avila and St John of the cross for example.



There are also besides this 17th century existence of Quietist that had to
be violently executed so to speak extracted from the main body of the
Catholic Church=97other much earlier strains of a Quietist form which did
influence and grow into the Christian Quietism.  The earliest forms are
along the lines of the Stoic Philosophy and later its Roman descendents,
which is how it must have =93hooked up=94 with the Christian version.



A Quietist in a Christian sense then and not necessarily be a Christian, bu=
t
is a Mystic, one who attains the union with God, or the Cloud of unknowing,
the Spirit, and this occurs while the person is alive; it is no a heaven
above but one here below=97that is one of the heretical aspects of it as we=
ll
as the idea that one may fuse with God in the manner of a personal
individual contact as is the mystic experience, called Quietist or not.



In Louis the XIV=92s time, many prominent persons became Quietist, so it wa=
s
under the protection of the king, and at the same time considered outlawed.



A poet like Gerard Manley Hopkins of r example might be thought of as a
Quietist and d also the poets whose work involves a deep fusing with Nature
as an energy of (Inscape) spiritual power outside the human self before
which that self must be sacrificed to break down the barriers between the
human being and the Divine being.





(In other words Quietism and Quietist poetry is transgressive, is about the
attainment of non-self, which might be accept by Siliman after a fashion,
yet the fusion with a Divine Spirit , something far greater than human
being=97perhaps wd not be so much accepted.)  Though of course it is pretty
idiotic of me to pretend to speak for Mr Siliman! O I apologize if the
speculation =93crosses the line.=94!--)


I don=92t see much difference between siliman and a quietist of the kind he
describes, which is quite different fro the heretical form of Quietism.
(Robert Grenier might be considered a Quietist poet of the heretical kind--=
)


and just wrote a piece re a poem by nada Gordon and one by James Levine
being pretty much the same despite one of them being Flarf and the other
supposedly conventional

(each form, movement, style, establishes its own conventions and then has
conventions to hear them discussed in the conventional manners--)

re grief i think the greatest line i read in English is the last line of
Faulkner=92s the wild palms
"between grief and nothing i take grief."

Edgar Allan Poe, whose bi-centenary it is,  wrote an immense amount on grie=
f
throughout his work and it is really his main theme, subject--source of
energy--"mournful and never ending remembrance' as he wrote--
"death looked gigantically down"

a language of mourning and "working through it" in the sense of Freud=92s t=
he
work of mourning (which could also be thought of as the work of morning, in
the way that Poe's morning on the Wissihican puns on Mourning on the
Wissihican--)
is Robert Smithson=92s work and writings with earthworks, in which the
mourning for the destruction of landscapes and earlier earthworks such as
Indian mounds--is "worked through" by bringing Earthworks art to collaborat=
e
with the landscape itself using technology and yes also the corporations
responsible for the disasters--to work together to create a new landscape a=
s
it were "out of the shell of the old" as the Wobblies say--

the mourning of the earth and the Morning of Time--in conjunction --the
mourning of the Goddess, Mother earth, the creation--and how to work with
the earth in "working through it together' with the humans who have brought
the mourning about--

Mohamed Choukri=92s great work For Bread Alone is a work of mourning re his
brother, killed y their father --and at the same time a morning as the
twenty year old illiterate Mohamed Choukri decides to learn to read and
write and become a writer--in classical Arabic, too--very difficult for an
educated person let alone an illiterate street person--
i know it is not poetry but then prose is often just as or more poetic than
much poetry-so i=92d include the novel by the great Catalan writer Merce
Rodorede, Camellia Street

Whitman wrote many mourning poems including the famous one for Lincoln--
and Robert Frost's Death of a Hired hand though dirge like is certainly a
mourning expressed throughout without intruding--
Shakespeare has many a fine farewell in his poetry and plays--
mourning and grief--and the ancient Greek dramas and poetry have some of th=
e
greatest--
in the western languages that have read

"At five o'clock in the afternoon" the famous Lorca poem re a bullfighter
killed in the ring--

(a lot of Dylan Thomas' poems are the refusal to mourn, which is
paradoxically form of mourning----"Do not go gentle into that good
night=92,  =93Refusal
to mourn the death by fire of child in London=94 etc=97



One moment of grief I recall very specifically is the last few lines of Ton=
i
Morrison=92s Sula=97



And the horrific killing of the children in Jude obscure by their own
parents=97



And the greatest one I know

=93Death letter=94 by Son House=97you can find him singing it in various ve=
rsions
on you tube

It=92s very good to hear from you!

Lauren,

Yes, A lot of Mysterios of Old Houses is about mourning and recovery from
it. Two people die in it.
As far as I know Poe also uses the term "quietist); but the intensely
negative term "quietist" hads come to mean in our day is, In my view,
utterly Ron Silliman's invention.

Ciao,

Murat

thank you for pointing this out. ron silliman's term (the school of
quietude or something like that) seems to take no account of this
earlier usage, so i find it very misleading; i wish he'd use something
else, if he has to use anything at all. i find terms like this and also
bernstein's "official verse culture" somewhat overly general," though at
least the latter addresses institutional processes rather than poetry
"itself," if there is such a thing.

on the topic of mourning: has someone already mentioned Peter Sacks's
work on elegy?

Scott Howard wrote:
> * Quietist poetry . . . ?  Well, Quietism seems to have emerged in the seventeenth century as a form of religious mysticism, but the term has occasionally been used to describe various works (philosophical, poetic, political) that advocate a middle way between ideology and indifference.  Sir Thomas Browne (also 17th c.) was called a 'quietist', but he was really more of a skeptical essayist (in the trad. of Montaigne).  Rae Armantrout's recent work strikes me as quietist in mood/tone.
>
> * Prevallet's Afterlife: Essay in Mourning Time is very good.  The literature on mourning and poetics is diverse and extensive.  See Ramazani's bibliography, for example.  See also: Beyond Consolation by Melissa Zeiger for a post-Freudian take on things.  Ramazani's book works well for the modernist paradigm, but to get beyond that framework, one needs to reconfigure the whole notion of resistance.  On that note, see: "'The Brevities': Formal Mourning, Transgression & Postmodern American Elegies", in _The World in Time and Space_ (Talisman House, 2002), 122-46, which covers a lot of ground.

Dear All

12th July is Chilean myth Pablo Neruda's 105th birthday. While more is
perhaps yet to be excavated from Neruda's ignored and forgotten work, his
known work has become mythical over the years. And sadly, like all mythical
walls, it often stands in the way to language-wide cross-sections of
innovative and explorative poets, wildflower and mushroom collectors of all
linguistic sorts, in all of Ibero-America today.

Kaurab International Poetry Reading Series proudly presents an exclusive
Chilean reading in Kolkata, India on the evening of July 12, 2009. The main
reader of the evening will be Madrid based young Chilean poet Violeta
Medina. Subhro Bandopadhyay, a polyglotic young Bengali poet who writes
simultaneously in Bangla and Espanol and lives in both Spain and India, will
introduce the poet.

The event is organized by Santanu Bandopadhyay, on behalf of Kaurab.

English Announcement -
http://www.kaurab.com/kabita_camp/kaurabshaal/violeta-reading.pdf

Bangla Announcement -
http://www.kaurab.com/kabita_camp/kaurabshaal/

A documentary film on forgotten Chilean poetic genious Gonzalo Rojas made by
Violeta Media will also be screened that evening.

Space is limited, but we would still like to extend an invitation to
everyone staying/living in Kolkata on 12th July, 2009.

beautiful essay, David. In D.C., mourning goes public with memorials to tee=
ns gunned down as a result of drug violence. Around a tree or a street lamp=
, photos, diary entries, notes from the bereaved, and other assorted moment=
oes.

it seems appropriate, even necessary, to respond to this coincidence:=20=20


announcing, for all those who will be in or near north Georgia next weekend=
,   a poetry event that makes clear the distinction between quietIST and qu=
ietNESS ...


it's the latest in the bi-monthly series of performance events, Language Ha=
rm, perpetrated by the Atlanta Poets Group;  and this month there is (or ar=
e) a dual theme (or dual themes):


quietness / economic downturn




Friday,  July 10


at: Eyedrum
290 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive
Atlanta


8:00 pm


$5
free for Eyedrum members


for directions to Eyedrum:

it is commonly observed that a great deal of contemporary art/writing
involves a double sense of 'the material'. the term is understood to refer
not only to the subject matter (the 'standard' understanding in writing) but
also the matter of the media in the piece, the material embodiment of the
piece. it's also commonly observed that the latter awareness of and approach
to composition not solely by ideation, meditation on the subject matter, but
also through operation on the material embodiment, has come to be much more
widely understood as a part of reading than it was a generation ago. when we
encounter work that does not follow the grammars and approaches
traditionally associated with work, we inquire into the methods of
composition, the approach to materiality, and look for relations between
those methods and approaches and the subject matter, or look for the subject
matter in the light of those things. and so read differently, thereby. and
in this way, we now read some literary work in ways that are closer to how
we approach a great deal of visual art.

but what i want to get at is something that isn't so commonly observed, at
the moment, but may be in the next generation. and that's the relation of
awareness of the materiality of writing/art to our ideas of who and what we
are. that's erm awkwardly stated. what i'm trying to get at is this. the
whole emphasis on materiality is involved in a larger movement to explore
how things like ideation, imagination, the spiritual, beauty, truth,
goodness, justice--all our ideals and things normally associated with the
immaterial--operate in the material world.

in this sense, we might say that the whole contemporary awareness of
materiality in art is part of a larger ah spiritual materialism. i googled
that term, after it occurred to me, and i assure you i'm using it in a
different sense than chögyam trungpa, who uses it "to describe mistakes
spiritual seekers commit which turn the pursuit of spiritualism into an ego
building and confusion creating endeavor" (wikipedia). instead, i'm refering
to a relatively common sort of philosophy in which the material substrate of
ideation and even the spiritual is affirmed and its relations with even the
flightiest of fancies are explored. not to denigrate or dismiss things like
spirituality but to explore how they operate materially.

perhaps more evidently, now, this is also related to philosophies of mind in
which the materiality of thought itself is affirmed--as a chemical and
informational process, however emergent--and the brain and the mind that
emerge from its processes are conceived as fully embodied in the material.
so that the idea of being able to create thinking machines (however unlike
us) becomes a real possibility. and we are conceptualized as nature's
(near?) ultimate machines. and machines are conceptualized not as the simple
things we once thought they must be but as often very complex biological
creatures that, nonetheless, are embodied in the material world and are,
therefore, subject to the constraints and possibilities of machines in the
material world.

to wrap it up, we now see the relation between contemporary artistic
emphasis on the materiality of writing/art and the larger moment of
'spiritual materialism'.

Rae Armantrout's recent work strikes me as quietist in mood/tone.

>> * Prevallet's Afterlife: Essay in Mourning Time is very good.  The literature on mourning and poetics is diverse and extensive.  See Ramazani's bibliography, for example.  See also: Beyond Consolation by Melissa Zeiger for a post-Freudian take on things.  Ramazani's book works well for the modernist paradigm, but to get beyond that framework, one needs to reconfigure the whole notion of resistance.  On that note, see: "'The Brevities': Formal Mourning, Transgression & Postmodern American Elegies", in _The World in Time and Space_ (Talisman House, 2002), 122-46, which covers a lot of ground.

>> * Fragments and grief/mourning? . . . Have you read Mallarme's "Pour un tombeau d'Anatole"?  Paul Auster's translation (North Point, 1983) is great.  A classic.

>>> What is quietist poetry?  I'm really curious; I've never heard the term.
>>>   I tend to think of fragmented poetry (and prose) as best articulating grief.  Have you ever read Kristin Prevallet's I, Afterlife: Essay in Mourning Time?  And part of what I love about Alice Notley's work is that her poems have engaged with grief in so many different ways.  I can't claim to have read the whole book (it's one of the books one's not aloud to check out of the New York Public Library), but the introduction to Patricia Rae's Modernism and Mourning makes some interesting points about the politics of grief and writing about grief. I found it helpful alongside Ramazini, though I can't claim to have read all of that, either.

Jim,

Interesting post. Are you familiar with Charles Olson's work? In a
conversation with Herbert Kenny, 1969, Olson says "I mean something I
believe we possess crucially. I think our body is our soul. And if you don'=
t
have your body as a factor of creation, you don't have a soul." Olson
articulates the same idea at other times, too.

In any event, an explanation of the above would prove lengthy, so please
feel free to backchannel me if you're so inclined. I'm writing two books on
Olson at the moment.

Bests,

interesting post. I wonder if you've considered the letter to Adorno
in Benjamin's writings concerning 'Materialist Theology'. In
particcular his response to Adorno's refrain that one's attitude is
made manifest in the styles with which an artist composes her material
.  (Adorno finds cigarette smoking to be a striking exemplar.)
Benjamin rejects the idea - launched by Adorno from his dissertation
on Kierkegaard's 'Diary of a Seducer' - that attitude, bearing, grace,
and 'comportment' are objects that can only be displayed. Benjamin, in
simple, argues that the unconscious is already 'attitude.' ... I'm
interested in what you might say about the need to worry about
thinking machines that reflect Benjamin's mentholation of the
unconscious.

What happened to the original poster of this query?  I'd be interested
in her thoughts on the matter. (Lauren  Russell)

Lauren et al. Thank you for all your references and comments.

What prompted my query is my observation (subjective perspective) that
in the initial shock and grief of loss we tend to turn to classical,
lyrical, and SoQ poetry rather than post-avant and other named
postmodern poetry. Either it is because we are truly at a loss for
words; and these poems are the most accessible and easily shared, or
we haven't the intellectual and emotional resources to engage more
abstract poetry. After a "suitable" period of time, when we've had
time to process the grief, the creative process ignites, and we're
able to craft and read postmodern or existential poetry which more
accurately portrays the loss itself. In other words, words fail, but
the art of them doesn't.

Regarding the SoQ/Post-Avant dichotomy itself, what I've managed to
glean from casual reading, is the criticism is aimed at ending what
Mr. Silliman's considers a hegemony in traditional publishing and
academia. My impression (again, subjective and lacking in pedantics)
is that among the small press and internet poetics community, the
hegemony is strictly post-avant.

Mary

  Dear All

  12th July is Chilean myth Pablo Neruda's 105th birthday. While more is =
perhaps yet to be excavated from Neruda's ignored and forgotten work, =
his known work has become mythical over the years. And sadly, like all =
mythical walls, it often stands in the way to language-wide =
cross-sections of innovative and explorative poets, wildflower and =
mushroom collectors of all linguistic sorts, in all of Ibero-America =
today.=20

  Kaurab International Poetry Reading Series proudly presents an =
exclusive Chilean reading in Kolkata, India on the evening of July 12, =
2009. The main reader of the evening will be Madrid based young Chilean =
poet Violeta Medina. Subhro Bandopadhyay, a polyglotic young Bengali =
poet who writes simultaneously in Bangla and Espanol and lives in both =
Spain and India, will introduce the poet.=20

  The event is organized by Santanu Bandopadhyay, on behalf of Kaurab.

  English Announcement -

  Bangla Announcement -

  A documentary film on forgotten Chilean poetic genious Gonzalo Rojas =
made by Violeta Media will also be screened that evening.

  Space is limited, but we would still like to extend an invitation to =
everyone staying/living in Kolkata on 12th July, 2009.

"The Bauhaus: 90 Years / 90 Days" is a new project which commemorates the
Bauhaus movement, which celebrates its 90th anniversary this year. Every day
during this 90-day project (from July till October 2009), at least one
project will happen which creatively plays around with and pays homage to an
aspect of the Bauhaus movement. Examples of those projects might include a
dance performance inspired by Oskar Schlemmer's ballet, a musical
performance that uses a Kandinsky painting as a graphic score, a fiber art
project inspired by Anni Albers' work, a poem inspired by Walter Gropius'
architecture, a short story inspired by Marianne Brandt's work, an essay
reflecting on an aspect of the Bauhaus movement, and so on.



Today is the starting date of "The Bauhaus: 90 Years / 90 Days." Grahm
Balkany, Director of the Gropius in Chicago Coalition, reads selections of
Gropius' speeches -- 12:30 p.m. in Chicago's Federal Plaza (50 W. Adams,
Chicago, IL).



These events will be presented at different locations around the world.
Information about this project's day-to-day developments will be posted at
http://www.bauhaus9090.org. "The Bauhaus: 90 Years / 90 Days" is being
organized by the Borderbend Arts Collective and the Gropius in Chicago
Coalition.

Interesting post. Are you familiar with Charles Olson's work? In a=20
conversation with Herbert Kenny, 1969, Olson says "I mean something I=20

t=20
have your body as a factor of creation, you don't have a soul." Olson=20
articulates the same idea at other times, too.=20

In any event, an explanation of the above would prove lengthy, so please=20

my fifteenth trade poetry title, a compact of words, is apparently out
now, with Irish publisher, Salmon;

http://www.salmonpoetry.com/acompactofwords.html

with parts of it appearing previously in such places as Jacket magazine, here;

check the publisher for ordering and/or review copies; i should have
copies myself in a week or so, hopefully, for anyone else;

Some of these ideas might approach the way Slavoj Zizek reads the Hegelian
paradox that "the spirit is a bone" .... I am travelling without any books
and so I can't say much more or even verify my quote etc but your the Olson
quote brings this idea to mind, in light of the previous email.

Libraries in Ohio are in danger of losing at least 20% and as high as 50% of funding from the State of Ohio if the cuts proposed by Governor Strickland are approved. This vote is still not solidified, and I ask that  you immediately take action yourself as well as sending this e-mail to all other friends, families, and relatives living in Ohio. Cuts in Library hours, programs, materials, and all services libraries currently provide will especially hurt our rural cultural center here, and some libraries may even close.

In order to keep funding, please write notes and call the following people this week:

Senator Steve Buehrer 614-466-8150
SD01@senate.state.oh.us

Representative Bruce Goodwin 614-644-5091
District74@ohr.state.oh.us

Governor Ted Strickland 614-466-3555
or write him a note right one the web

Thank you for your time in this matter.

Dear Jim=97

=20

Actually the materialism of the spiritual and spiritual
materialism is probably the oldest ideas of =93spiritual/material=94
interrelationships

From Cave Paintings=2C pictograms to the most highly evolved
human scripts like the Mayan=2C carved into stones and arranged=97as well a=
s Mayan
Cave writing=97these are the oldest forms of works which grew into the huge
number of religions and belief systems in which the spiritual materialism i=
s
one of the major points of difference between them and religions where this
belief in the power of the materiality does not exist.  The current ideas o=
f =93materiality of the
word=94 go back to the writings of the Russian Futurists in 1913 (The Word =
as
Such=2C) writings and to many of the forms of writing
developed from the Dadas Haussmann=2C Schwitters (The Letter as Such) =2C H=
ugo Ball to the Lettristes
to Sound Poetry.  The spiritual need not
be  and mostly is  not the =93dogmatic religious form=94 at all =2C
but that related throughout history to speaking in tongues=2C mystical expe=
riences=2C
visions and the sense that all existing things persons everything are
themselves spiritual materialism.=20

=20

The material of the works that is used with writing is at
the very start and through the entire history of writing.  Often to make so=
mething seem =93new=2C=94 like
spiritual materialism or more directly=2C the effect of their materiasl on =
the arts
and their reception=2C  is a rebranded version of the
"old=2C" on order to market what is actually =93old wine in new
bottles." =20

For example=97the uses of stone and caves wall were used
because they ENDURE THROUGH TIME much better than other writing materials. =
 Tens of thousand year old works by having
existed so long through time have lost their message in terms of the presen=
t
day reading=97yet at the same time one immediately recognizes them AS WRING=
=97and
that they are communicating=2C transmitting still out into the cosmos=2C an=
d that
communication one may see hear read in the present=2C beyond meaning=2C yet
material that is present and effecting one greatly.

=20

All my work made with found objects stones grass broken
branches machine parts plastic etc=97are working together with=2C collabora=
ting
with =2Cthe material and its limits=2C its demand and its questions back an=
d forth
when one works=97and that is the reason I call my works =93rubBEings=94=97f=
or me they
are as alive s anyone and as myself=2C and communicating=2C working with on=
e=2C
especially as in my works with paintings and rubBEings both=2C I touch the =
paper
on one side and directly pressing back from the other are the materials.

=20

Sometimes to heighten this=2C emphasize it=2C I have images fragments
letters or words =96facing towards the viewer on one side=97and facing away=
 from
the viewer for those =93on the other side=94 to see.

=20

Many contemporary works that emphasize the materials used as
presences in the work and also indicate the presence of an other presence=
=97are
made by hand.  (In fact it is just
announced today the world=92s oldest Bible found so far is of course
handwritten=97I am not sure why Yahoo News thought=97what=97that it might b=
e
typewritten??)=97

Book artists of today work much as the transcribers of the
Book of Kells did and those in other cultures and timtes even earlier
throughout the world.  The use of papyrus
birch bark=2C stone=2C al maner of materials=2C where deeply part of the
spiritual.  Oneof ht ideas of The Book
most prevalent in American culture is that it does matter which form of The
Book one uses=2C which material one in terms of binding=2C the kinds of
illustrations or not=2C the types of the fonts and their changing sizes etc=
  The spiritual materialism can be read and
seen and touched in all versions=2C editions=2C=20
al manner f Books and the editions of the bible through time have been
one method of this=2C or the Torah=2C Kabala=2C the Gospels=2C the book of =
Psalms=97handmade
editions which =93speak=94 with the very materials used=97

=20

Despite the existence of the =93material word=94 of the last roughly
thrity years in =93experimental=94 writing=2C  out of Russian Futurism=2C t=
he trend is in the
opposite direction=97to the virtual.   That
is   spirit in a sense is displacing
matter.  This is one of the crucial
changes that virtuality is working in society=97the transference of the =93=
real=94 to
the virtual=2C while the real itself is becoming ever more often effectivel=
y
=93deleted.=94

=20

During the recent protests in Iran and their grim suppression=2C
how did the world follow the events?  Via
twitter=2C cell phone cameras=2C Facebook=2C cam corder hook ups and other =
electronic
digital virtual transmissions and receptions.=20
The protests themselves were by students and urban white collar workers
and others with access to the electrically plugged in communications system=
s. (Battery operated devices do after al need to be plugged
in at some point to recharge as do lap tops and others electronics.)  Where=
 and who were the rest of the
Iranians?  As far as the (observing)
world was concerned=2C they did not exist=97they had been left behind in th=
e
darkness of the unrecorded=2C unremitted=2C =93backward=94 zones.  Effectiv=
ely=2C these Iranians were deleted in
order that the focus be solely on the higher educated and tech-savvy primar=
ily young
urbanites

        These Iranians
then=2C do exist and via Neda=2C have become part of the world=92s consciou=
s. American
TV carried persons throwing stones at advancing armed police and army force=
s=2C
and Americans were cheering for them.=20
For decades exposed to stone throwing Palestinians as =93bad=94 =93terroris=
ts=94
as they face the world=92s fourth largest military=2C Americans for the mos=
t part
aere suposed to feel hatred and fear=2C and wishing =93they would just go
away.=94  The change in the meaning of the
same image (one could just as well use stock footage as =93real=92) is so e=
asily
manipulated by simply changing the title=2C caption and media-created =93co=
ntext=94
that it is very easy to imagine that al events are =93staged=94 for the cam=
eras=2C
while the real events take place off screen.=20
Since =93the world sees=94 the staged or not events=97that is what exists a=
s
the real=2C the spiritual material of spiritual materialism.=20

           In contrast
are event s which are specifically intended to as mush as possible if not
completely take place =93off screen=2C=94 so that events are =93over with=
=94 and what
remains is the new=2C cleansed arena of the media=92s presentations of the =
staged
events celebrating =93victory=94 or =93war crimes=2C genocides=2C ethnic cl=
eanings.

             Even
though Gaza has been deprived for long time of electricity except on rare
occasions and very tiny amounts=2C the entire area was effectively made =93=
off
limits=94 by the banning of all media until after the events had made possi=
ble
what is in effect =93un fait accompli.=94

              The genocides in Rwanda happend in the same
manner=97al contact with the outside=2C electrical=2C via cable=2C phones=
=97was cut off
and then the killings began.

         In Cambodia
also=2C the American bombings and the Khmer Rouge Regime=2C which banned al
=93modern=94 devices=2C created a =93black hole=94 in terms of media=2C and=
 so millions
died =93off screen.=94=20

        Even within
the USA
the same =93set up=94 is used=97here on the bulk of the American Indian
Reservations.  Currently the American
Indian health care is hitting a disastrous low point=2C with large drops in=
 life expectancey
and large gains in infant motility.=20
Despair is rampant=2C and drugs and alcohol as always are there to help
numb it.  Entire peoples are again
experiencing being =93the Vanishing American Indian.=94  Why isn=92t this c=
overed except
sporadically?  According to the Federal employees
in charge of many of these wide spread populations=2C the problem is one of
distance=2C and also of the Indians not having computers.  The Government f=
eels it has done al it needs
to do about getting information and registration forms for benefits and
assistance=2C because it has created a special web site just for this speci=
fic
purposes.

             The
commentary on this =93black out=94 of Indians from the media=2C virtual vie=
w=2C is that
well=2C it's their fault=2C because if they would just come to a Federal st=
aion
they could use a computer and find al this stuff.  But they won=92t come in=
=2C being Indians and al the
ugly stereotypes attached to this.  No
one seems to find it strange the Agents in charge of the people=92s welfare=
 aren=92t
at al motivated or interested in going out as they are supposed to and find=
ing
out what is going on.  Why bother?  Who cares about the persons vanishing i=
nto a
black hole?

         =20

            =93Spiritual
materialism=94 in a sense is a rediscovery process for those with the acces=
s and
time and safety and comfort to do so.=20
Peoples who have always known of it are =93left out in the cold.=94  The gr=
owing gaps between the rich and poor
manifest themselves as the spiritual materialism of who is visible=2C paid
attention to=2C made a Cause=2C and who is left off screen=2C in the dark=
=2C to
vanish. =20

         The world is
not only fighting for oil to continue its polluting of the world and slaugh=
ters
of person=2C but in a sense already fighting for who has access to the web=
=2C to
electricity=2C to access and visibility as =93spiritual materials=94 on scr=
een while
its opposites=2C the immaterial=2C vanish.

=20

 =93Spiritual
materialism is paradoxically the transference of the actuality of materiali=
sm
into its philosophical and spiritual manifestations as abstract=2C distance=
d=2C  as observing events and beings without being
present.  Those things and Beings not
present as abstractions=2C symbols for Causes=2C Propaganda=2C manipulation=
 and
advertising-entertainment=2C are being =93disappeared=94 by the materialism=
 of Drones
which are "spiritual" in that they are being guided by non-present
persons on the other side of the world=2C who only see the things that are
present on a screen as targets of focused techno-perception and massacre.

moves from natural facts to words as their signs=2C to "particular"
natural facts being symbols of spiritual facts and then to nature as a symb=
ol
of spirit.=20



           The movement from
the natural to the spiritual=2C from signs to symbols in a peculiar way see=
ms not
unlike what one might call a "Transcendentalism of the
Virtual."  Or=2C perhaps=2C Transcendentalism in Reverse=2C in the way that
Robert Smithson=2C after Nabokov=2C wrote of construction sites as "ruins i=
n
reverse."=20



          One begins--in this
reversal-- from the Transcendental "spirit"--the Virtual
Image--Virtuality being not unlike "spirit" in the sense that is
"there" via symbols (digital codes)--and since particular spiritual
facts are symbols of particular natural facts--(whose signs are
words)--then--"nature is the symbol of spirit."=20



          In other words=2C the
world is a symbol of the virtual.  Words as "signs of natural
facts" which are "spiritual facts" which are the turning of
nature into the symbol of the spiritual--are both "signs of natural
facts" and symbols of the spirit.  Language and nature are symbols of
spirit--or=2C Virtuality.=20



         Spirit is Virtuality.
Virtuality is spirituality=2C and so=2C in a way=2C becomes=2C is=2C also
virtue (The shared etymology of the Latin virtus.)



          Virtuality as virtue=2C as
another form of the spirituality which redeems the "fallen world" by
turning it into a "symbol."=20



         This has a strange effect on
the experience of=2C perception of=2C the world=2C as it no longer exists=
=2C but is now
world-as-symbol. For=2C if it is a symbol=2C this means the world is not
"real."



           The
world-as-symbol becomes a place of tourism for the "virtual eye"-- taking
the Surrealists' trips to the flea markets to new heights.=20



 There are tours now for persons to take in which they are shown the
"signage" and other "symbols" of the virtual that exist in
their neighborhoods.  This form of perception is considered a "virtue."=20
The poet Charles Bernstein goes to China and comes back with --what
else--but a great many photos of signs and "symbols."  The
disconnect between the English "mistranslations" from the Chinese is
a=94symbolic joke" and illustrative of one's own virtue as a perceiver of
signs and symbols.  (Though I always wonder if the Chinese might not
actually be saying something like--well=2C we shall leave that to the reade=
r's
imagination.)=20



      By virtue=2C so to speak=2C of this effect of the
Virtual=2C what is seen in the world are only those things which are signs =
and
symbols of the symbolic world of the Virtual.



      What one sees in the world is a reflection of
the Virtual.  That is=2C one recognizes as "real" only those
things which one knows from the Virtual. In a sense the tours of one's
neighborhood as a trove of signage and symbols are a form of training in th=
is
recognition of the Virtual  "real" and its virtues.=20



      Yet what of those who live=2C pagans=2C beyond the
pale of the virtues of Virtual "access?" =20



        One speaks of the "dependence
on foreign oil"--one hears little about the "dependence on
electricity" in terms of access to the "real" as it is realized
in the Virtual.=20



       Are those who exist beyond electricity's
reach those are without virtue?



        This would seem to be the case for
those affected by the following events:  in Rwanda=2C when the massacres we=
re to
being=2C all cables=2C telephone lines=2C any electric access=2C was comple=
tely cut
off.  Once sealed from the real Virtual world=2C the now Virtual
"disappeareds" were removed from the world as being without
virtue.  In Myanmar=2C
protests were followed by the cut-off with the outside world of cable and p=
hone
access.  In the world's largest ever prison=2C already Walled off from the
world=2C a "refugee Camp=2C" the Palestinians of Gaza are disappearing
from virtue by virtue of the cut off of electricity.  When all the lights
go out--where will they be?=20



       If one were to go about cutting off
electricity=2C chopping off cables=2C pulling plugs=2C denying on line acce=
ss to
citizens for various reasons--controlling who is part of the Virtual and
virtuous world--one might wonder if part of the possibility of this is to
inculcate ever more "willing suspension of disbelief" in the
Virtual and its virtues in the denizens of the Virtual.=20



For then will they not ever more willingly accede to the
"transparency" of a new Transparent Eyeball in reverse=2C the
Panoptical Eye of instantaneous "real time" surveillance of
everyone and access to everyone's files=2C images=2C messages=2C transactio=
ns in
order to keep "secure" the virtue of the Virtual?=20



The threat of the loss of the Virtual=2C of being a part of the virtues of =
the
Virtual=2C may become a new form of discipline.  And=2C desirous to not los=
e
one's sense of Virtual Reality=2C might not one then accede to entering int=
o a
world wide prison?=20



To "die" outside the Virtual--or to "Live" as a prisoner.



Along those cheerful lines--Drew Kunz recently invited me to a group involv=
ed
with thinking on the artistic developments through time taking the grid as =
a
proposition for work.  Personally I don't like grids at all (even though
one benefits much of course from the virtues of the electronic grids--) and
personal experience of them has done nothing to tarnish the dislike.=20

   Yet paradoxically=2C due to this dislike of grids and what they may
men in various circumstances=2C a great deal of my work has made use of the=
m=2C far
more than one realized.

       This flickr gallery includes works made
with overt and explicit as well as more covert and implicit grids.  Many
are from a series of "Walls" which will be forthcoming in a book from
Otoliths.  The examples here are often of language that is affected by
violence=2C fire=2C the wear and tear of Time=2C the "dirtiness" of
non-Virtual and virtuous existence.=20

       Attached is an essay "Hidden in Plain
Sight" which appeared in Otoliths which discuss the impact since childhood
of construction sites=2C crow's nests and found materials on my work and me=
thods.

        The essay has a link to another short
piece re Bob Cobbing=2C my friend and mentor. Of the two of us jw curry wro=
te
that=2C outside the division of "Clean" and "Dirty" Schools
of Visual Poetry=2C there was the "Quick'nDirty" School of Cobbing
and Chirot.  Bob Cobbing was one of the great geniuses and artists of the
20th Century.  He and Kurt Schwitters=2C with Dubuffet=2C are for me the th=
ree
most important artists of their times.=20

       I see their work and what I continue on
with as a kind of guerilla art of survival in the hidden in plain site/sigh=
t/cite
of the real world=2C as opposed to existing solely in the Virtual world whi=
ch is
not real=2C but a reflection=2C though its effects are real.=20

        This kind of work can be done
anytime any where with next to nothing at all except the everything that is
here and there=2C there=2C there--found all around one=2C right at hand. It=
 is
"born" of necessity=2C the Motherfucker of Invention.=20

I'm finding this string really quite interesting. Glad to hear evidence of
such a wide-ranging interest.

Aryanil, much thanks for reminding me of Whitman and Tagore. I'm tempted to
add Pound to that set, too.

There are a few significant differences between, say, Olson and Whitman.
Briefly, Olson's cosmology took the philosophy of mathematics, quantum
mechanics, and Cybernetic theory (which turns into information theory,
really) into account, as well as the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, etc.

For sure, there are similarities to Whitman, but I figured (perhaps too
hastily?) that a post-Heisenberg view of reality might key into Jim's ideas
a bit more readily.

As for Eastern approaches to spirituality, perhaps one of the more
interesting bits in Olson is his use of the first line from Wilhelm's
translation of The Secret of the Golden Flower: "That which exists through
itself is what is called meaning." And it is useful to note that Whilhelm
translates "meaning" with a capital "M" (suggesting Tao), whereas Olson use=
s
the term in lower-case.

Simply (and reductively), Olson uses the line to indicate something closer
to autopoiesis than Logos, or rather the One. Creeley explains that one
consequence of all this is that language is not "importantly" referential.
Still provocative, I think.

And, Chris, as for Benjamin, I'm thinking of his use of "nunc stans," in
particular, and what uses it may have in this context....

Anyway, just a few thoughts.

Bests,
Chris

Which words make you wince?
Poets have been asked for their most hated words. What are yours?

'What word do you hate and why?' is the intriguing question put to a =20
selection of poets by the Ledbury festival. Philip Wells's reply is =20
the winner for me - 'pulchritude' is certainly up there on my =20
blacklist. He even explains his animosity in suitably poetic terms:

"it violates all the magical impulses of balanced onomatopoeic =20
language - it of course means "beautiful", but its meaning is nothing =20=

of the sort, being stuffed to the brim with a brutally latinate cudgel =20=

of barbaric consonants. If consonants represent riverbanks and vowels =20=

the river's flow, this is the word equivalent of the bottomless abyss =20=

of dry bones, where demons gather to spit acid."

For Geraldine Monk, "it's got to be 'redacted' which makes me feel =20
totally sick. It's a brutish sounding word. It doesn't flow, it prods =20=

at you in a nasty manner."

Both these poets understand that the key to words that make you feel =20
nauseous is not the meaning - it's easy, after all, to hate the word =20
'torture' =96 but something else entirely. Something idiosyncratic, =20
something about the way the word feels in your mouth as you say it. =20
The horrors of 'membrane', for instance. Or the eccentricity of =20
'gusset'.

Having said that, I'm still trying to get my head around Paul =20
Batchelor's explanation that "I've always hated the word 'APPAL' (or =20
'appalled' or 'appalling') because I dislike hearing the sound of my =20
name inside other words." I can't work out if there's a case of =20
extreme ego or extreme self-hatred going on there.

And I can't help feeling that Ros Barber misses the point with her =20
rather po-faced reply. "Words are to be loved. Their associations may =20=

be unpleasant but words themselves are full of poetry (and history, =20
and geography)," she says. "Delicious vowel sounds and tongue-tickling =20=

consonants. There isn't a word in the English language that doesn't =20
excite me if I think about it long enough."

Sorry, Ros, I can't agree. I'm with Rhian Edwards on 'chillax' - "the =20=

most unnecessary and obnoxious linguistic blend to have ever been =20
coined". Except possibly for 'no-brainer'...

Whether it's 'hubby' or 'sassy' or 'webinar' =96 what are the words that =
=20
make you wince?

 would have, because I wasn't reading on an intellectual level at that time=

What happened to the original poster of this query?=A0 I'd be interested
in her thoughts on the matter. (Lauren=A0 Russell)

Lauren et al. Thank you for all your references and comments.

What prompted my query is my observation (subjective perspective) that
in the initial shock and grief of loss we tend to turn to classical,
lyrical, and SoQ poetry rather than post-avant and other named
postmodern poetry. Either it is because we are truly at a loss for
words; and these poems are the most accessible and easily shared, or
we haven't the intellectual and emotional resources to engage more
abstract poetry. After a "suitable" period of time, when we've had
time to process the grief, the creative process ignites, and we're
able to craft and read postmodern or existential poetry which more
accurately portrays the loss itself. In other words, words fail, but
the art of them doesn't.

Regarding the SoQ/Post-Avant dichotomy itself, what I've managed to
glean from casual reading, is the criticism is aimed at ending what
Mr. Silliman's considers a hegemony in traditional publishing and
academia. My impression (again, subjective and lacking in pedantics)
is that among the small press and internet poetics community, the
hegemony is strictly post-avant.

This is one of those threads that gets me thinking, and I've been looking
forward to every post. I've not read them all, so I apologize if I am
repeating anything. Eight years ago when someone I felt particularly close
to died, almost literally in my arms, I needed some poetry that would help.
What met my need at the time was Lynn Dreyer's book The White Museum
(Roof,1986). Here's a sample:
http://poetryproject.org/wp-content/uploads/v124-kimberly-lyons-lynne-dreyer
.pdf. Something about its heartbeat, its wave-like backbeat, soothed me, the
way a mother might rock a child during a stricken moment. That episode of
choice in reading pushed me towards thinking about writing as healing, an
issue that's been on my mind ever since.

Much of post-avant writing, obviously, employs parody, often of a
particularly biting kind. It's no surprise that at a time of ear splitting,
mind smashing hypocrisies and assaults on a social/political level that some
of our best minds might want to address such grotesque realties in ways that
accurately reflect them when modes of earnestness or literal or symbolic or
abstract statement, what I once called writing below the din, won't suffice.

At a time of personal crisis, what one might want, what I wanted as I said,
are truthful yet gentle words, singing, compassionate, and yes, even quiet
words. Still, such occasional personal needs probably do not justify a
dominant poetics of quietism in an ongoing way. There is something
reassuring and stimulating about experiencing a number of relatively newer
voices work to invent and persist with new forms that convincingly reflect
the impossibility of accepting as such the eco-socio-political realities we
are forced to live in right now. The post avant employs a biting,
confrontational voice that says, to me anyway, don't give up trying to
dispassionately recognize and reveal what that reality is, as painfully
traumatic, as incessantly quotidian as it is coming to be. Forms that meet
that continuous nightmare face to face, as unimaginable as it is, or was. Is
the most relevant issue in contemporary poetics hegemony, or power, or is it
which model, the quietist or the post-avant, suggests the more apropos
interpretation of current reality as it actually presents itself?

Either way, life's needs are inordinately complex, and issues of poetic
movement aside, one size will not always fit all.

I wrote on some of these issues in a piece on Charles Bernstein's Girly Man
for Jacket a couple years ago, here:

http://jacketmagazine.com/33/thomas-glass-bernstein.shtml

Specifically, how the poet's poet's response to 9/11, his grief around the
event, creates a lyric (and even, as Lauren puts it, a classical, in fact
explicitly Romantic) turn in the book. That lyric turn turns out to make the
collection 'accessible' according to the majority of reviews.

Seconding the interest in this thread,,,

The word that I was looking for that I just HATE is "impacted."

I apologize i neglected before  recommend a very great contemporary work on
grief and mourning, the best in poetry i am aware of personally, --though i
like also much alice notley's-- and  the most interesting, experimental and
engaging one--is THE LIGHT SANG AS IT LEFT YOUR EYES
Our Autobiography
as it is the lives of both Eileen and her father during the their life times
and interrelationships before and after his dying.

(The word Sang is on the cover  in red while the the others are in
black=--as "sang" in French means blood"--so--a blood song, the two, father
and daughter "being of the same blood," as family and also as Filipinos.)

TOf all books on this subject i know of,  this one is the most beautiful
arcing , aching and joyful presentations of what Freud called "The Work of
Mourning."

The books uses a great many different forms and genres of poerey, including
the visual, ekphrasis, hay(na)ku, blog posts and a series of "Cantos which
has redacted and blank Cantos among them. There are also "playing a part"
the  translations by contemporary poets  of other poets and poems created in
English out of Eileen's  collaboration's with other poets still.    There
are also translation by the author, as well as some poetry that simply
appears untranslated,.  History  and place play a large role also--the
Marcos Regime Era that Eileen grew up in, the Independence documents of the
Philippines, and events real and fictional in the world outside the
Philippines which are used as "narrative devices" as it were in creating a
book long series of "songs" and "cantos"  which chart the movement of
emotions through time, preceding  the old age, illness and death of the
poet's father, and those which are in flux before and after death, with a
theme of reconciliation.  (Even with Ferdinand Marcos--whose Martial law
created in Eileen's child a kindof mixed Being of half God and half God the
Father as Dictator.  (one interpretation of this--).

This is one of those threads that gets me thinking, and I've been looking
forward to every post. I've not read them all, so I apologize if I am
repeating anything. Eight years ago when someone I felt particularly close
to died, almost literally in my arms, I needed some poetry that would help.
What met my need at the time was Lynn Dreyer's book The White Museum
(Roof,1986). Here's a sample:

way a mother might rock a child during a stricken moment. That episode of
choice in reading pushed me towards thinking about writing as healing, an
issue that's been on my mind ever since.

Much of post-avant writing, obviously, employs parody, often of a
particularly biting kind. It's no surprise that at a time of ear splitting,
mind smashing hypocrisies and assaults on a social/political level that som=
e
of our best minds might want to address such grotesque realties in ways tha=
t
accurately reflect them when modes of earnestness or literal or symbolic or
abstract statement, what I once called writing below the din, won't suffice=
.

At a time of personal crisis, what one might want, what I wanted as I said,
are truthful yet gentle words, singing, compassionate, and yes, even quiet
words. Still, such occasional personal needs probably do not justify a
dominant poetics of quietism in an ongoing way. There is something
reassuring and stimulating about experiencing a number of relatively newer
voices work to invent and persist with new forms that convincingly reflect
the impossibility of accepting as such the eco-socio-political realities we
are forced to live in right now. The post avant employs a biting,
confrontational voice that says, to me anyway, don't give up trying to
dispassionately recognize and reveal what that reality is, as painfully
traumatic, as incessantly quotidian as it is coming to be. Forms that meet
that continuous nightmare face to face, as unimaginable as it is, or was. I=
s
the most relevant issue in contemporary poetics hegemony, or power, or is i=
t
which model, the quietist or the post-avant, suggests the more apropos
interpretation of current reality as it actually presents itself?

Either way, life's needs are inordinately complex, and issues of poetic
movement aside, one size will not always fit all.

Chax Press is doing its best to get through a hot summer of publishing
7 books! Also creating new handprinted works, planning classes, youth
programs, planning for the long range. And Chax Press needs help!

Wouldn't it be great if every local friend, long-distance friend,
personal friend, poetry friend, poetics friend, pog friend, & every
facebook friend, & friends on other lists, donated $10 or $5?! Yes!
that's what we need, that's what it takes. Or $11 or $6 to more than
make up for the cut paypal takes.

Our goal is 1000 contributions of $10 or $11 or $5 or $6.

Go to http://chax.org/donate and DO IT NOW, please!  We are nonprofit
and it IS tax deductible. Go! more poems, please.

If you've already given this spring or summer, then this message
really isn't for you, unless you want it to be.

We're also creating a new electronic newsletter, and a donation will
definitely put you on the list to receive it. Of course, if you don't
want to receive it, just let us know.

In a few days we'll announce one new book, and two more in a few
weeks, and several more at the end of the summer! This is the
beginning. A leap is now!

Ready: 1, 2, 3, contribute!

One final reminder...
KS=20

ED SANDERS : GLYPHS 1962-2009

A rare exhibition of nearly half a century of Ed Sanders?s glyph-poems
produced between 1962 and 2009 will be on display at The Arm in Williamsbur=
g
[Brooklyn, NY] from July 10 through July 31. An opening reception will be
held on July 10th at 6PM.

Building on a long history of utilizing a highly visible language that
continues into the present, Sanders?s glyph-poems fuse image with text, and
image as text. Political, personal, ephemeral, historical, uncanny, and
humorous=A1=AAthe glyph-poems on display at The Arm appear in several different
mediums, including original drawings, collages, mimeographed pages from Fuc=
k
You/ A Magazine of the Arts (1962-'65), plus a number featuring color
images, and an artist?s book. Over 200 Glyph-works will be featured in the
show.

In addition, Glyphs 1962-2009 will feature new letterpress prints and a
limited edition catalogue produced on location at The Arm.

Edward Sanders is a poet, historian and musician. He is at work, since 1998=
,
on a 9-volume America, a History in Verse. The first five volumes, tracing
the history of the 20th century, have been completed and published in a
fully indexed CD format, over 2,000 pages in length, by Blake Route Press.
Another recent writing project is Poems for New Orleans, a book and CD on
the history of that great city, and its tribulations during and after
hurricane Katrina. He has been granted a Guggenheim fellowship in poetry, a
National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in verse, an American Book Award
for his collected poems, and other awards for his writing. Other books in
print include Tales of Beatnik Glory (4 volumes published in a single
edition), 1968, a History in Verse; The Poetry and Life of Allen Ginsberg,
The Family, a history of the Charles Manson murder group, and Chekhov, a
biography in verse of Anton Chekhov.

Sanders was the founder of the satiric folk/rock group, The Fugs, which has
released many albums and CDs during its 45 year history. The Fugs have
recently completed a CD, Be Free, The Fugs Final CD (Part 2), featuring 14
new tunes. Be Free will be released in late summer. Two of Sanders' books,
The Family and Tales of Beatnik Glory, are under option to be made into
movies. His selected poems, 1986-2008, Let?s Not Keep Fighting the Trojan
War will be published by Coffee House Press in the fall of 2009. He lives i=
n
Woodstock, New York with his wife, the essayist and painter Miriam Sanders,
and both are active in environmental and other social issues. Sanders will
perform a section of America, the 17th Century, tracing the voyage of Henry
Hudson up the Hudson River in 1609, at the Byrdcliffe Art Colony in
Woodstock on August 8, as part of the 400th anniversary celebration of
Hudson?s discoveries.

Opening reception for Glyphs 1962-2009 on Friday, July 10th from 6PM.

What = "poetics"
Why = it's a word than makes me wince.

Which words make you wince?
Poets have been asked for their most hated words. What are yours?

'What word do you hate and why?' is the intriguing question put to a
selection of poets by the Ledbury festival. Philip Wells's reply is
the winner for me - 'pulchritude' is certainly up there on my
blacklist. He even explains his animosity in suitably poetic terms:

"it violates all the magical impulses of balanced onomatopoeic
language - it of course means "beautiful", but its meaning is nothing
of the sort, being stuffed to the brim with a brutally latinate cudgel
of barbaric consonants. If consonants represent riverbanks and vowels
the river's flow, this is the word equivalent of the bottomless abyss
of dry bones, where demons gather to spit acid."

For Geraldine Monk, "it's got to be 'redacted' which makes me feel
totally sick. It's a brutish sounding word. It doesn't flow, it prods
at you in a nasty manner."

Both these poets understand that the key to words that make you feel
nauseous is not the meaning - it's easy, after all, to hate the word
'torture' - but something else entirely. Something idiosyncratic,
something about the way the word feels in your mouth as you say it.
The horrors of 'membrane', for instance. Or the eccentricity of
'gusset'.

Having said that, I'm still trying to get my head around Paul
Batchelor's explanation that "I've always hated the word 'APPAL' (or
'appalled' or 'appalling') because I dislike hearing the sound of my
name inside other words." I can't work out if there's a case of
extreme ego or extreme self-hatred going on there.

And I can't help feeling that Ros Barber misses the point with her
rather po-faced reply. "Words are to be loved. Their associations may
be unpleasant but words themselves are full of poetry (and history,
and geography)," she says. "Delicious vowel sounds and tongue-tickling
consonants. There isn't a word in the English language that doesn't
excite me if I think about it long enough."

Sorry, Ros, I can't agree. I'm with Rhian Edwards on 'chillax' - "the
most unnecessary and obnoxious linguistic blend to have ever been
coined". Except possibly for 'no-brainer'...

Whether it's 'hubby' or 'sassy' or 'webinar' - what are the words that
make you wince?

(many folks are posting their most hated words in the comments)

"creative writing" is the language of a bureaucrat, not a writer.

"THE AMERICAN PEOPLE" WHEN SAID BY ANY PERSON IN POLITICS

"radical,innovative poetry"--is always being asked for; meaning it is
conventional, safe, dull

"native; native american" its patronizing and makes one think of "the
natives are getting restless" in twenty million movies with Bwana aka Bwana
Devil; it's American Indian as Russell Means pointed out everyone else is a
something-American, Chinese-American, Irish-Americanm, African American;
only Indians have America first--because the First Peoples--American Indian
of course "American"  is named for an Italian--
and then why is chef boy-ar-dee making "franco american spagetti"!
a real puzzler since childhood

Do not like "No" and "can't"
But really can't stand "at the end of the day" a combination of acceptable =
words far worse than its parts.

Which words make you wince?
Poets have been asked for their most hated words. What are yours?

'What word do you hate and why?' is the intriguing question put to a=A0=20
selection of poets by the Ledbury festival. Philip Wells's reply is=A0=20
the winner for me - 'pulchritude' is certainly up there on my=A0=20
blacklist. He even explains his animosity in suitably poetic terms:

"it violates all the magical impulses of balanced onomatopoeic=A0=20
language - it of course means "beautiful", but its meaning is nothing=A0=20
of the sort, being stuffed to the brim with a brutally latinate cudgel=A0=
=20
of barbaric consonants. If consonants represent riverbanks and vowels=A0=20
the river's flow, this is the word equivalent of the bottomless abyss=A0=20
of dry bones, where demons gather to spit acid."

For Geraldine Monk, "it's got to be 'redacted' which makes me feel=A0=20
totally sick. It's a brutish sounding word. It doesn't flow, it prods=A0=20
at you in a nasty manner."

Both these poets understand that the key to words that make you feel=A0=20
nauseous is not the meaning - it's easy, after all, to hate the word=A0=20
'torture' - but something else entirely. Something idiosyncratic,=A0=20
something about the way the word feels in your mouth as you say it.=A0=20
The horrors of 'membrane', for instance. Or the eccentricity of=A0=20
'gusset'.

Having said that, I'm still trying to get my head around Paul=A0=20
Batchelor's explanation that "I've always hated the word 'APPAL' (or=A0=20
'appalled' or 'appalling') because I dislike hearing the sound of my=A0=20
name inside other words." I can't work out if there's a case of=A0=20
extreme ego or extreme self-hatred going on there.

And I can't help feeling that Ros Barber misses the point with her=A0=20
rather po-faced reply. "Words are to be loved. Their associations may=A0=20
be unpleasant but words themselves are full of poetry (and history,=A0=20
and geography)," she says. "Delicious vowel sounds and tongue-tickling=A0=
=20
consonants. There isn't a word in the English language that doesn't=A0=20
excite me if I think about it long enough."

Sorry, Ros, I can't agree. I'm with Rhian Edwards on 'chillax' - "the=A0=20
most unnecessary and obnoxious linguistic blend to have ever been=A0=20
coined". Except possibly for 'no-brainer'...

Whether it's 'hubby' or 'sassy' or 'webinar' - what are the words that=A0=

Writing Post-Person: Poetics, Literacy and Sustainability in the Age of
Disposable Discourse is Kedrick James's 2009 doctoral dissertation. It's a
terrific look at the history of automated spam and how spoets (spam poets)
are situated in that environment. He also develops very useful perspectives
on informational garbage and recycling toward a poetics of sustainability
and informational environmentalism. How do writers and and how does writing
move forward in the age of automated, disposable discourse when writing is
devalued by automated excess, and the proliferation of other, competing
media? Kedrick James's thesis is hopeful, actually, in what many perceive to
be a dark time for literary writing and education, and that hope is partly
in what he sees arising from active engagement by writers in these issues.

What I've done at http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kedrick/slideshow.htm is to take
four samples of writing from his thesis, together with photos of Kedrick and
some of his graphical collages, and collage them in dbCinema in appreciation
of what he's doing. I've also created a stir fry text at
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/kedrick.htm from those samples of his thesis.
You can read the quotations themselves by clicking on the rectangle in the
stir fry or mix them together by mousing over the text.

I think his thesis is significant to contemporary writing and encourage you
to visit his website,  http://kedrickjames.net  and his band's site
http://disciplineofchaos.com -- he's  in a collaging/sampling band. The
thesis is not available online but if you want to read it, contact him.

Sorry I miffed the donate web address when I sent this yesterday.
Thanks to all who found it anyway. The correct address is http://chax.org/donate.htm
    (now corrected below, too)

cheers to all,

Charles / Chax Press



Chax Press is doing its best to get through a hot summer of publishing
7 books! Also creating new handprinted works, planning classes, youth
programs, planning for the long range. And Chax Press needs help!

Wouldn't it be great if every local friend, long-distance friend,
personal friend, poetry friend, poetics friend, pog friend, & every
facebook friend, & friends on other lists, donated $10 or $5?! Yes!
that's what we need, that's what it takes. Or $11 or $6 to more than
make up for the cut paypal takes.

Our goal is 1000 contributions of $10 or $11 or $5 or $6.

Go to http://chax.org/donate.htm and DO IT NOW, please!  We are
nonprofit and it IS tax deductible. Go! more poems, please.

If you've already given this spring or summer, then this message
really isn't for you, unless you want it to be.

We're also creating a new electronic newsletter, and a donation will
definitely put you on the list to receive it. Of course, if you don't
want to receive it, just let us know.

In a few days we'll announce one new book, and two more in a few
weeks, and several more at the end of the summer! This is the
beginning. A leap is now!

Ready: 1, 2, 3, contribute!

I hate the word "community," as in "The Black Community," "The LGBT Communi=
ty," "The Jewish Community," etc., because it advances an oversimplified vi=
ew of the world in asserting the existence of these enormous "communities" =
that do not actually exist.=A0 I mean, what is the often-discussed Black Co=
mmunity, anyway?=A0 There are many black communities, and there are black p=
eople who do not belong to any community, and there are black people who be=
long to communities that consist primarily of people who are not black.=A0 =
There is no single, homogenous "Black Community" as that misuse of the word=
 seems to suggest.

It is a one woman play in poetry about loss and transition. The play takes=

 causing her to look over her life and confront her demons. This internal=
 conversation is revealed to the audience through poetry and music, ultima=
tely expressing a life of growth, and the discovery of a hope which allows=
 the character to find her way forward.

Dear Big Bridge Readers,=20

Please check out the new ROCKPILE Website & Blog at Big Bridge, =
www.bigbridge.org/rockpile/

ROCKPILE is a collaboration between David Meltzer - poet, musician, =
essayist, and more - and Michael Rothenberg of Big Bridge Press. David =
and Michael will journey through eight cities in the U.S. to perform =
poetry and prose, composed while on the road, with local musicians and =
artists in each city. ROCKPILE will serve to educate and preserve as =
well as to create a history of collaboration. It will help to reinforce =
the tradition of the troubadour of all generations, central to the =
cultural upheaval and identity politics that reawakened poets, artists, =
musicians, and songwriters in the mid-1960s through the 1970s. The =
project will end with a final multimedia performance celebration in San =
Francisco.

The ROCKPILE Website & Blog will tell you all you need to know about the =
ROCKPILE project including performance dates, venues, artist bios and =
performance clips of some of the musicians we will be meeting and =
performing with in each of the cities.=20

Once we hit the road, we will be posting  travel photos, journal =
entries, performance videos, interviews and more, daily, on the ROCKPILE =
Blog, so log on and join us as we travel around the country. Write us, =
comment on the blog, and let us know you are with us, let us know you =
care!=20

And of course, we hope to see you on the road!

Best,=20

Michael Rothenberg, David Meltzer, Terri Carrion & Ziggy.



ROCKPILE

Made possible by a grant from the Creative Work Fund, a program of the =
Walter and Elise Haas Fund,=20
also supported by generous grants from The William and Flora Hewlett =
Foundation and The James Irvine Foundation, and support from the =
Committee on Poetry.

Well...I have attempted to write fiction, but it takes so long. I don't thi=
nk that is the reason, though. I know many poets write fiction and non-fict=
ion. I find that my brain works with short bursts of thoughts, not prolonge=
d bursts of thoughts. It is a shame. Maybe those of us who would like to wr=
ite fiction should start an online workshop of sorts. (I was reading the be=
low post, and yes, poetry is word acrobatics, certainly more than fiction.

Yes, as a definable, factual, actual group, 'community' is/was probably alw=
ays a fiction.=A0 Yet,=A0 'community' particularly as a word representing g=
roup fiction(s) back circa 196_ - 197_ was in many ways a very effective on=
e in terms of uniting people and giving power to create, support, pass and =
enforce legislation (new laws) that overturned discriminatory practices, fu=
rthering job training and promotion, opening up kinds of scholarship, no ma=
tter what any individual of any color or sexual or ethnic persuasion though=
t about their actual relationship (or not) to to such within their own ascr=

ultiple 'communities ' , fictitious, or momentary,=A0 or we would be still =
stuck with our white fore-present-future white fathers who might have been =

By the way, the Souther Poverty Law Center needs your contributions. Phone =

 *About Amir Parsa:* An internationally acclaimed writer and poet, Amir
Parsa is the author of over ten literary books, most recently* Drive-by
Cannibalism in the Baroque Tradition*, and *Erre*. An uncategorizable body
of work, Mr. Parsa's literary oeuvre - written in English, French and
Persian - constitutes a radical polyphonic enterprise that puts into
question national, cultural and aesthetic attachments and discourses while
fashioning new genres, forms and even species of literary artifacts (*Fragm=
ent
*and *Ifs & Co.*). He was included in the anthology of new French and
Francophone poets (Ed. Huguet 2004). Born in Tehran, Mr. Parsa holds degree=
s
from Princeton and Columbia and currently lives in New York, where he is a
Lecturer and Educator at the Museum of Modern Art. His work is featured in
Purdah 2.0: Body Matters as a site specific installation and constitutes on=
e
fragment of canto XIV.

Purdah 2.0: Body Matters
*The Second Annual Arts Exhibition at Engendered*

June 25th-July 16th, 2009 | Halvai Gallery, 75 Grand Street, NY
*Opening Reception: June 30, 2009 7 p.m.*

After the inaugural edition of Purdah - the unprecedented transcultural
exhibition on art, gender and sexuality last year, Engendered presents
Purdah 2.0: Body Matters.

Curated In Two Parts by:
*Amina Begum Ahmed & Priyanka Mathew*

Exhibition Director :
*Myna Mukherjee*

Body Matters is a contemporary & provocative exploration both of why the
body matters and what matters of the body are, have been and could become.
Across cultures, how do we find a visual and aesthetic language to engage
with the body as simultaneously a site of refuge, resistance, tradition,
freedom, sorrow, solace, desire, pain, rebellion, and rage? Body Matters
investigates the body as a site for contestations of power & violence,
perception & reality, memory & loss, and finally, station & displacement -
especially within urban ecologies and the ever morphous shifting boundaries
of personal and political geographies.

Ahmed brings together diverse artists whose stories and experiences form a
narrative that excavates, personalizes and reclaims the 'body' that has bee=
n
subsumed by the dominant normative . On the other hand, Mathew's curation o=
f
artists explores the human form as an agent/catalyst to dissect political,
social and metaphysical dialogues on sexuality, gender and the relationship=
s
in the grey areas that don't qualify neatly in either category.

Body Matters brings together figurative, conceptual, experiential and also
site specific works by some of the most leading, iconic and emergent
transcultural artists from India, Pakistan, Iran, U.S & China.

so should the filter words be words you love or words you hate?  or
should they be some sort of allergen related words, like "tissue" and
"histamine"?

"The blank and ruin we see in Nature {prose here on poetics} is in our own
eye.
R W Emerson

i've never really understood why this endless setting against each other of
two different things is supposed to be so important; are Americans too
hooked on the US vs THEM mentality---?
do poets feel so insecure they have to keep attacking prose?

a good deal of what a piece of writing is is what is there not only on the
part of the writer, but the reader also
people write of wanting "open work"
yet isn't there a narrowness rather than openness on the part of the reader
who demands openness but only of a certain kind?
how open is the reader to openness--?
does it justt end at a narrow point--or, before even reading, judge a piece
as "unopen" --because prose say is "never open?"--

i.e. if one approaches a "poem" as always superior to "dull, functional
narrative unloved unwanted prose"--then of course poetry will come out, no
matter if it is  good or bad--
 i think it is a lack of imagiantion; perhaps a form of lack of corage
to--keep the doors and windows open to find among what blows in rains in
snows --has to offer-to make use of and find interest in-
doesn't everyone i a sense when they get tiredof the poem or prose infront
of them start writing it in some other way--?
(the French writer Pierre bayard brings this up in his book on How to tlak
about books one has never read--)
as Aryanil wrote--one is really as a writer multi disclinipary--i've been a
reorter, a reviewer, an essaysist, a traanslator, a visua/sound/lecial poet=
,
a collage artoist, a griffiti maker, maker of ruBEings, of clay impression
spray paintings vbideo maker fiklm maker actor  screen play writer  . .. et=
c
from each kind of writing both as writer and reader one always find
materials of interest and use--there is always something to "pick up on" in
one media or grnre for a completely different one; so as not to be creating
the "expected unexpected" dictated bythe set of rules one adhers to, or
"school, type, group, community" of writers adheres to
no, one takes and learns from every method continually because they are al
interrelated--al are writing and reading written and read silent or aloud-o=
r
with other materials than pen and ink, pencil and eraser--
prose does la lot of things far better than poetry and often times may be
poetry of a kind only the very best of poems can touch
and poetry does things prose doesn't do-though it can rise to the heights o=
f
the best prose--

 one takes note that many poets write both good poems and good prose--good
radio or film scripts--good drama--good short stories (dylan thomas for
example-)

Felix Feneon demostarted that one may make both novellas and peotry out of
the from of the 3 line  faits divers, "Nouvelles en trois lignes" (Nouvelle=
s
are both short stories and 'the news"--)

perhaps what Amy notes is poetry as a specialization, in which case it
becomes separate, and even elitist in its view of other forms of writing,
and constructs a hierarchy within itself, in which only certain forms are
permitted, only certain words, only certain distortions dis uptures
transgressions and so on, the more specialized it becomes-

if more writings are viewed as interconnected by being simply different
forms of the same underlying act,writing,  then they are writing al of them
and each has a lot to give to each--

unlike Aranil, i don't think anyone kind of writer has an advantage over th=
e
other, such as poets over prose writers, in making the ulti-disciplinary ar=
t

adfer all, a poet is writing this!

isn't the poet going to do their best to "sell the idea of poetry's
superiority?"

the idea of one kind of humans, one kind of writers, being better than
another (poets better than prose writers)--the world's too ful of
"superiority" and "us vs them" as it is--
and whatabout greatreporters journalist--??
"why i have believed as many as 5 impossible things before breakfast!" says
the Red Queen in Alice through the Lookingglass--
writers of the world unite!!!!
nothing to lose but the chains that divide  one kind of writer from another

I have never found it to be a problem.
I have managed a lot of novels and books of stories.

I think that that is not all that uncommon in Canada.

(speaking of words to despise=97staycation makes me want to forget the
neologisms ever existed)

"Locavores," "staycations" get official in dictionary

http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5690LE20090710


"Locavores" can officially take a "staycation" this year, being among
100 new words to feature in the 2009 edition of a leading U.S.
dictionary, Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.

John Morse, president and publisher of Merriam-Webster Inc., said
staycation -- meaning a vacation spent at home or nearby -- was a good
example of a word meeting a need and establishing itself in the
language very quickly, having first appeared in 2005 but taken off in
use in 2007.

He said people enjoyed blending existing words.

"Another example of this kind of creative wordplay from this year's
list is frenemy: one who pretends to be a friend but is actually an
enemy," said Morse in a statement.

"But, in addition to these 'portmanteau words', we have added new
words from more predictable categories, like science, health,
technology, and popular culture, which have also seen widespread use
across a variety of publications."

Many of the new words which appear in the 11th updated print edition
and online version of the dictionary reflected the importance of the
environment, such a "carbon footprint," which is a measure of carbon
emissions, and "green-collar," referring to jobs that help the
environment.

Words relating to health and medicine were also featured such as
"locavore," or a person eating foods grown locally, and
"cardioprotective," meaning serving to protect the heart.

The list included "waterboarding," an interrogation technique decried
by human rights groups in which water is poured into the detainee's
mouth and nose to give the sensation of drowning.

Pop culture gave rise to a list of new words, with this year's edition
featuring "docusoap," "fan fiction," and "reggaeton" -- a popular
music of Puerto Rico that combines rap with Caribbean rhythms.

Words from online activities were also making their way into the
mainstream, some of which have come back into popular use, such as
"sock puppet," which can mean a hand puppet made of a sock or a false
online identity used to deceive.

"Vlog," a blog containing video material, makes its first appearance
in the dictionary as does "webisode," a TV show that can be seen
through a website.

New eating trends were also highlighted by first-time entries such as
"acai" and "goji," both berries that can used in drinks or as juice,
and "shawarma," meaning a sandwich of sliced lamb or chicken with
vegetables, and often tahini, wrapped in pita bread.

Merriam-Webster Inc. has been revising and publishing dictionaries since 18=
43.

i am currently in the transition, working on longish prose. my advise to my=
self was, make prose theatrical. if poetry, in some sense, the lyric, is mu=

Ouch!

In my high school days I probably would have asked you if your family lived
in a submarine (courtesy of a joke that was popular with us pubescent
boys)...

Q: What's long and hard and full of se(a)men?
A: A submarine.

I suspect that the word "submarine" may now join your personal list of
wince-words! Sorry :)

I sat down almost three years ago and began writing something I thought
totally worthless, beyond publication possibilities (on purpose), etc. =
and
have to date written an ungodly amount of revisions of a 150-page =
novella.
Can't stop going back in. (Even this morning, after submitting it to a
publisher yesterday.)

Before that, only little, single-impulse stories. "Flasher fictions" as =
one
editor described them.=20

Now I feel the sense that the difference in poetry/fiction from the =
writing
standpoint is vibrant and real, but also protean and (sorry Bob) not the =
use
beyond taxonomy that people would normally consider.=20

I remember Creeley writing that he wanted to be considered a "writer" =
rather
than a "poet." I certainly see what he means (having written poetry for
nearly four decades), but I also see the draw in my engagement with =
fiction
is just a winsome, compelling, alluring, etc. as that within the writing =
of
poetry.

In both, a luminous fleshy presence.

I won't trade any of my various experiences (and in writing all types of
poetry as well) for any of the others. (Thankfully, one doesn't have =
to.)

I figure that those who can write both fiction and poetry are either more t=
alented or more tenacious. What are your thoughts on that?

I have never found it to be a problem.
I have managed a lot of novels and books of stories.

I think that that is not all that uncommon in Canada.
Kroetsch, Atwood, MacEwen, Ondaatje, McFadden, Cohen, etc.

That is, George Stanley is a superb and form-inventing poet,
but he could never write two pages of prose fiction.

On the other hand the good poet Gilbert Sorrentino became one of the
US's very best novelists.
In reading him it is a lot more work to read the novels than to read
the poems.
I expect that such was also true of the writing.

there are a few singular talents who've managed to create 1st rate work in =
fiction, poetry, and drama as well as the essay. Consider Denis Johnson, or=
 Jim Harrison, or the late Thomas Dish. & of course we have the Buk, as wel=
l as Raymond Carver. I blame the so-called creative writing programs for th=
e unfortunate distinction between fiction and prose. Jeanette Winterson doe=
sn't make such distinctions when she discusses her work.=20

I have never found it to be a problem.
I have managed a lot of novels and books of stories.

I think that that is not all that uncommon in Canada.

When I was looking at Ashbery's Selected recently (I've been a fan for over
40 years) I had the thought: there is real coloring of fiction about this
writing, only the "episodes" and "interior monologues" are very brief and
evanescent. Yet a particular and recognizable attitude, "voice", whatever,
and a sense of a specific life, with its relationships, big and petty
issues, disappointments, revelations, worries, surprises, dejections being
reflected on, is continuous.

You make a good point, Stephen, and I can accept that this (mis)use of "com=

Skip,

From what little I've seen lately, it seems some of the most recent collect=
ions of short stories are beginning to resemble "flash fiction."=A0 I wonde=
r if this is indicative of some sort of general waning of our communal atte=
ntion spans, or what book publishers see as such.

Best,

I sat down almost three years ago and began writing something I thought
totally worthless, beyond publication possibilities (on purpose), etc. and
have to date written an ungodly amount of revisions of a 150-page novella.
Can't stop going back in. (Even this morning, after submitting it to a
publisher yesterday.)

Before that, only little, single-impulse stories. "Flasher fictions" as one
editor described them.=20

Now I feel the sense that the difference in poetry/fiction from the writing
standpoint is vibrant and real, but also protean and (sorry Bob) not the us=
e
beyond taxonomy that people would normally consider.=20

I remember Creeley writing that he wanted to be considered a "writer" rathe=
r
than a "poet." I certainly see what he means (having written poetry for
nearly four decades), but I also see the draw in my engagement with fiction
is just a winsome, compelling, alluring, etc. as that within the writing of
poetry.

In both, a luminous fleshy presence.

I won't trade any of my various experiences (and in writing all types of
poetry as well) for any of the others. (Thankfully, one doesn't have to.)

I am waiting for Roberto Bolano's collection of poetry. I think that it will be out in November. His fiction is amazing and my understanding is that he wanted to write poetry, but fiction brought in the money.

I have never found it to be a problem.
I have managed a lot of novels and books of stories.

I think that that is not all that uncommon in Canada.
Kroetsch, Atwood, MacEwen, Ondaatje, McFadden, Cohen, etc.

David,

"constructs a hierarchy within itself, in which only certain forms are
permitted, only certain words, only certain distortions dis uptures
transgressions and so on, the more specialized it becomes-"

such "permitted" disruptions or transgressions are no disruptions/
transgressions at all, but the reverse, the very definition of conventional
thought. It becomes a hierarchy convinced in its own superiority, the other=
s
merely "quietists."

Yeats wrote short fiction. The Stories of Red Hanrahan. And there are
stories embedded in the intros to the two editions of A Vision.

Sure, and why not throw in the Goddamn bible. I mean, hell, what is the bib=
le? Narrative? Epic poetry? I'm thinking mostly of the Old Testament, of co=
urse.=A0 As for "The Wire, " I'm a big fan of crime fiction, and George Pel=
acanos is the main producer of "The Wire." Indeed, in the broad sense of th=
e term (...poet...), why not include Pelacanos as a poet of the streets of =
Washington, D.C.? Perhaps Q Taratino is the poet of video store clerks, if =
not their saint. Why not talk about failed poets who turned to fiction afte=
r their bout with poetry. Consider William Faulkner. As for cartoonist, I h=
ave no problem calling E Gorey, or even=A0 Mr. peanuts Schultz, a poet. Ugh=
, what was the topic???

  July 7, 2009: The MetaConstruct

These are scans, in no particular order, of an installation proposal
packet ignored by galleries all over the world (but mostly in Canada.)
Twenty-five years later, there is still no support for this work. In
fact, it's been clearly denied and suppressed. Given a choice between
another installation and seeing art-institutions burn to the ground
along with all their attendant curatorial neophytes -- it wouldn't take
more than two seconds to decide. To hell with government arts-funding!

A special issue of ESC: English Studies in Canada that members of the list
might find of interest:

"On Discreteness: Event and Sound in Poetry." Edited by Louis Cabri and
Peter Quartermain. Digital Sound Editor Michael Hennessey.

As Guest Editor Louis Cabri writes, "What most of these sixteen contributors
to ESC: English Studies in Canada share--wihch makes this issue somewhat
timely--is the intent to listen to the sound of poets' (and for one
contributor, to listen to the sound of actors') poetry recordings, including
other poetry performances. In this respect, there are contributors who
consider recordings of Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams, Brion
Gyson and Kenneth Rexroth, and contemporaries Caroline Bergvall, Charles
Bernstein, Anne Carson, and Geraldine Monk, among others, from Canada, the
U.S., and the UK."

Print copies of the issue include a compact disc with 47 tracks considered
in the articles. Contributions from: Rachel Blau DuPlessis, Scott Pound, Bob
Perelman, Brook Houglum, Michael Hennessey, Meredith Quartermain, Suzanne
Zelazo, Katherine Verhagen, Emily Carr, Brian Reed, Tom Orange, Bruce
Holsapple, Reuven Tsur, Sarah Parry, Geoffrey Hlibchuk, Jon Cotner and Andy
Fitch.

"ta(l)king eyes is the most ambitious and successful long poem since
Adrienne Rich's An Atlas of the Difficult World. In its honesty,
imaginative brilliance, hybridic nature, and deep passions, it hits
the reader the way William Carlos Williams's Spring and All must have
hit its first readers.  Powerful, truthful, and unforgettable -- this
long poem is a fully achieved epic experiment for our times." --

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed; delsp=yes

At Chax Press, we have been working for more than a year on the
handmade book, Salt, My Love: A Ballad, by Patrick Pritchett. The book
was actually printed in 2008, and a few copies were finished and sent
to the author. But the handpainting in these books by Cynthia Miller
is extremely time consuming, and the books have taken many more months
to have enough for us to announce the book publicly. Now is that
moment, though indeed, not all of the books are yet finished. But
please, overwhelm us with orders for this truly remarkable letterpress-
printed, hand-bound book, and we will ship what we have and finish
more as soon as possible.

"At last the light dims, and salt finds our mouths again."

Patrick Pritchett's 10 part, sensuous, spiritual, and philosophical
love poem unfolds amid Cynthia Miller's white painted pages.
Literally, several pages unfold to turn a 20-page, 2-signature hand-
sewn structure into a 24-page book printed letterpress on Nideggen
paper. The book's covers, from St. Armand paper mill in Montreal, are
a hand-made crinkly grey-brown paper whose texture recalls ancient
scrolls, or the edge of the sea, a source of salt, as Pritchett
writes, "the salt is taking us / both out to sea."

The book is printed in 2 colors on Nideggen paper with Perpetua
foundry type. It is sewn in a 2-signature method with concertina, and
the covers are papers of tan linen fibers, handmade by the St. Armand
papermill in Montreal.

The visual artist Cynthia Miller, for long a major part of the
artistic program at Chax Press, has hand-painted multiple pages in the
book, using both pochoir method and free paint method. These paintings
are entirely done in white acrylic and white ink.

A few copies of Salt, My Love were boxed and sent to press
subscribers, and now unboxed copies are available to the public at a
price of $90 each. Discounts are available to libraries and educators
and for multiple purchases; please inquire. In addition, standing
orders to Chax Press, who commit to purchasing all that we publish,
receive a 30% discount. We will not charge for shipping this book on
pre-paid orders.

This book is not available on our web site as of yet.

You may order it by sending a check to us at 411 N 7th Ave, Ste 103,
Tucson, AZ 85705-8388. Or, you may respond to this email, and we can
arrange a time for you to call in with a credit or debit card payment.

Thank you!
Charles/Chax Press

ps: We also have recently sent out an announcement for a new book by
Jacque Vaught Brogan. Information on more new books, by Joel Bettridge
and Jane Sprague, to come your way within 2 weeks. Altogether we plan
on announcing 7 new books this summer.

n poetry reading sites.=A0 Perhaps my skills are lacking.=A0 Portland, OR o=
nly has one site about the police making poetry...?

Please send me your poetry reading sites so that I might update my list -- =
I'll post it here and on my blog for future reference when all seems comple=
te!=A0 That way, whenever intrepid poets travel, they'll be able to check t=
he sites and see what's what in your town!

Thanks,

Sure, and why not throw in the Goddamn bible. I mean, hell, what is the bib=

Here we go;
the usual widening and widening of the topic
until we can include everything, such as L'il Abner and,oh, The Wire.

I bet many poets do write fiction, but we write it for ourselves. I like to=
 simply write whatever and wherever my brain takes me. It may be awful writ=
ing--I don't know because I am too close to it, but it is fun and a bit sca=
ry and exciting. I really never know exactly where I am going.=20

dear friends

we at displaced press are very please to announce the publication of our
latest book:

Johan J=F6nson's Collobert Orbital, translated by Johannes G=F6ransson Now
Available<http://displacedpress.blogspot.com/2009/06/johan-jonsons-collober=
t-orbital.html>
We
are pleased to announce the publication of Johan J=F6nson's Collobert
Orbital (translated
by Johannes G=F6ransson)

Praise for Collobert Orbital from Mark Nowak:

If Vicente Huidobro met Georges Bataille on a Waste Management(R)truck, the
result might be something akin to Johan J=F6nsson's Collobert Orbital, the =
new
manifesto of "the waste-disposal-working-class." At times soaring across
"aerospatiality," at others existentially grounded in "an overheated world
factory" of "all work, all healthcare, all logistics," J=F6nsson's linguist=
ic
propulsions and dynamic formal innovations challenge "a victorious bourgeoi=
s
poetry order" to, once again, rearticulate verse experimentation to the
politics and poetics of working a day job.


Praise for Collobert Orbital from Bruce Andrews

Donna Snyder, Deb Hoag and Jonathan Penton will be attending the Way Out
West Book Festival in Alpine, Texas on July 31st and August 1st. The WOW
Texas Festival is an off-beat celebration of Southwestern literature; a
hip and fun interpretation of what it means to be a desert-bound writer.
Check out http://www.wowtxbookfestival.com/ for more information.

On Saturday, immediately after the festival, we'll be driving through
the sunset to La Kiva Restaurant and Bar in Terlingua, Texas (
http://www.lakiva.net/ ), which happens to be my favorite bar in my
favorite area on earth. Terlingua is the town between the Big Bend
National Park and the Big Bend Texas State Park, itself an ancient
mining site with a cemetery that makes you feel icky in the best
possible way. And reverent. Terlingua is one of the many tiny towns in
the southwest that has been occupied by anarchists, Wiccans, freaks, and
weirdoes, and La Kiva is a wonderfully friendly place to congregate with
them. I cannot sufficiently sing the praises of Big Bend National Park
and Terlingua's Chisos Mining Company Motel as a vacation spot (though I
admit that August is not the time of year one normally explores the
area). Terlingua's the subject of the 2007 documentary /"Ghost Town: 24
Hours in Terlingua/."

If you live in the Big Bend area and have never been, our reading there
is, clearly, the perfect opportunity to investigate. If not, be sure to
lift a drink to us that weekend, for we will be reading in Terlingua,
and you will not.

That's:
Donna Snyder, Deb Hoag, and Jonathan Penton
Saturday, August 1st, 9pm Central Daylight Time
La Kiva Restaurant and Bar
Highway 170 in Terlingua, Texas

Hugs and kisses,

Donna Snyder is the founder and curator of The Tumblewords Project, a
community-based writing workshop that has served the Southwest on almost
every Saturday for the past fourteen years. She has presented hundreds
of creative
writing workshops as an artist in the schools in the El Paso/ Las Cruces
region, various local literary festivals, and community-funded events.
She has published her work in such journals as /"Puerto Del Sol, Sin
Fronteras, BorderSenses/," and select on-line journals. She has been a
featured artist in such performance events and venues as the Taos Poetry
Circus, the Border Book Festival, El Paso Museum of Art’s Museo-Literati
reading series, the Branigan Library Authors Series, Umbilicus Mundi,
the South Broadway Cultural Center in Albuquerque, the Out on a Limb
series at the Santa Fe Actor’s Theater, and the Texas Kick-Ass Poets
tour. She was a member of El Paso’s seminal poetry jam band, Central
Nervous System. Her work as an artist, cultural and political organizer,
and grassroots lawyer has been featured in articles in the "/El Paso
Times, Bridge Review, Albuquerque Journal, Stanton Street, Alamogordo
Daily News/," and the /"Las Cruces Sun/." In 2002 she won the Emma
Tenayuca prize for her human rights work.

Currently, Donna is preparing poetry manuscripts for El Rancho Press,
Mouthfeel Press, and, of course, Unlikely Books, which will publish her
manuscript in the summer of 2010. She’s also working on the first
edition of /Mezcla/, the print anthology of The Tumblewords Project.

Deb Hoag will be reading from/ "Crashin' the Real: one woman's search
for truth, justice . . . and Steven Tyler" /(Dog Horn Publishing, 2009).
When gonzo columnist Eve Petra is fired by her magazine's new owner, she
spends a couple of days (okay, a week or so) wallowing in self-pity and
Jack Daniels. To her great dismay, no one wants to hire a middle-aged
female version of Hunter Thompson. The market has changed. People have
changed. The only thing that hasn't changed is Eve.

Lying on her bed wondering what the hell has happened to her life, it
comes to her. Who has weathered every whim of the fickle public for
nearly five decades? Who has shown the ability to rise from the ashes of
every disaster? Who is looking down at her from a poster taped to her
bedroom ceiling?

Rock god Steven Tyler.

Deb Hoag holds a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of
Detroit Mercy. She has been working in the mental health field for
sixteen years, and is currently living and working in Flagstaff,
Arizona. In 2010 Unlikely Books will publish /"Dr. Gonzo: A series of
loosely related essays on equality, visibility and modern mental health/."

--

Jonathan Penton’s books of poetry are /"Last Chap/" (Vergin’ Press,
2004),/ "Painting Rust"/ and "/Blood and Salsa" /(bound together in one
volume by Unlikely Books, 2006) and /"Prosthetic Gods"/ (New Sins Press,
2008). He’ll be carrying these books and reading from them, and will

Oaxaca Justice Condemns Innocent APPO Man for the Murder of Brad Will
No Evidence and No Witnesses to the Actual Crime: Juan Manuel Martinez
Moreno Sentenced to Prison

By Nancy Davies
Commentary from Oaxaca

http://www.narconews.com/Issue58/article3679.html

July 10, 2009

Juan Manuel Martinez Moreno has been sentenced to prison by the judge
of the Fifth Federal Court, Rosa Iliana Noriega Perez, for the murder
of US Indymedia videographer Brad Will on October 26, 2006. This in
spite of:

    * Brad Will video-graphed his murderers running toward him carrying pis=
tols
    * The two assailants shown in the video, Abel Zarate, registrar of
Santa Lucia del Camino, and Oswaldo Manuel Aguilar Coello who was a
municipal police officer, were arrested but subsequently released by
government orders. Both are strongly tied to the PRI
    * There was no evidence for accusing Juan Martinez Moreno, who was
standing near, not facing, Brad Will when Will was shot
    * The =93witnesses=94 in fact saw nothing; Feria Perez, the chief
witness, admitted he repeated hearsay


from Democracy Now:

Activists Protest Jailing of Oaxaca Activist in Will Killing

And here in New York, a group of activists rallied outside the Mexican
consulate Monday to protest the latest in the case of the slain
American journalist Brad Will. Will was shot and killed on October 27,
2006, while covering the popular uprising in the Mexican province of
Oaxaca. His own camera captured his shooting. Will=92s family and
friends have criticized the Mexican government for charging a Oaxaca
activist with Will=92s murder instead of state police forces. Last week,
a Mexican judge reportedly ruled that the activist, Juan Moreno, can
be held indefinitely and that hearsay evidence can be used against
him. Mark Read, a friend of Brad Will, criticized Moreno=92s
prosecution.

    Mark Read: =93Juan Manuel Martinez Moreno, the man falsely accused
of Brad=92s murder, is also a part of this movement, also a man of
principle. That Brad=92s murder is being used to railroad a fellow
political activist is the most profound insult to his memory. And it
is not the first time that his death has been used in such a way.=94

Content-Type: text/plain;charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Struck by the acuteness of and subsequent attention to Christian Bök's
discussion of "Writing and Failure" on the Harriet Blog, I am looking for
further considerations of poetry and failure or poetry and inadequacy.  In
one regard, much has been written about poets and personal inadequacies or
senses of failure, but what about the actual writing of poetry as an
inevitably impossible, doomed, or failed endeavor?  Do we continue to
write poetry because it ultimately fails to do what we hope it might or
should?  Is the "failure of poetry" a failure of language, or poetics?

Any thoughts or ideas would be immensely appreciated.

That may be so for some and certainly is why I continue to write* a poem*,
but other than that I continue writing because those hopes shift and are
various.

>Is the "failure of poetry" a failure of language, or poetics?

Yes.

I can't speak to that, but I can recommend another book by B=F6k's =20
publishers (and, in the interests of full disclosure, my employer) =20
that may help: The Laundromat Essay by Kyle Buckley.

http://www.chbooks.com/catalogue/laundromat_essay

The book is ostensibly a long poem about a man's attempt to retrieve =20
his clothing from a nearby laundromat, but is more about the failure =20
and disappointment of poetry than anything else.

 =46rom a Calgary Herald interview with Buckley:

The former University of Calgary student first cobbled together the =20
thoughts behind The Laundromat Essay as part of a thesis for his =20
master's degree in English literature. He couldn't defend it, however, =20=

because he became increasingly fascinated with how it was a failure.

'I had a lot of questions when writing it,' he says. 'In some ways, it =20=

was the failure of cohesiveness in poetry and those questions of =20
concerns that I wrapped into how I rewrote the book. It's almost a =20
book written within the collapsing ruins of another book.'

Hi Michael,

Don't forget Samuel Beckett's words - "No matter - try again - fail again -
fail better". If everything was successful perfection, there would be no
point in going on - it's in the blood to keep trying and failing better,
orbiting around the impossibility of perfection, but keeping it in sight.
Missed aspirations might seem like failure but we are driven on to new and
perhaps more relevant aspirations.  Destiny might seem like a very abstract
and vague concept but experience seems to tell us that it does have a
reality in our lives.

Roy Exley.

Hard to say where one "poem" ends and the next begins.

Don't forget pleasure -- pleasure in language, pleasure in structuring the
"poem," referencing experience.

(Almost all of reading, for me; and a good part of my writing.)

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

Here are pages 25-26 of "The Gateless Gate":
http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/Pgs%2025-26.htm

Mirror site:

Introduction: http://web.pdx.edu/~pdx00282/Gate/Intro.htm

Notes:

1- I've decided to send two (one screen), instead of four pages, as I'm =
sure that many of you are pressed for time.
2-The colors have been changed, so that they may appear on each monitor =
closer to what I've intended.
3-The bibliography (Bib) link at the bottom of each page has been fixed, =
and bookmarks added.
4-As always, please let me know if you want to be deleted from these =
notices.

-Joel

Sometimes poetry fails and sometimes it succeeds.=A0 Which it is depends up=

Struck by the acuteness of and subsequent attention to Christian B=F6k's
discussion of "Writing and Failure" on the Harriet Blog, I am looking for
further considerations of poetry and failure or poetry and inadequacy.=A0 I=
n
one regard, much has been written about poets and personal inadequacies or
senses of failure, but what about the actual writing of poetry as an
inevitably impossible, doomed, or failed endeavor?=A0 Do we continue to
write poetry because it ultimately fails to do what we hope it might or
should?=A0 Is the "failure of poetry" a failure of language, or poetics?

Any thoughts or ideas would be immensely appreciated.

Creativity & Aging Workshop Students

Aviva Cristy

Joe Radke

 =20

The Creativity & Aging workshops were held every Tuesday
& Thursday=2C from 1pm-3pm=2C for the past seven weeks at the Wilson Park
Senior Center.  The students were
instructed by Joe Radke=2C Aviva Cristy=2C and Poet-in-Residence=2C Jack Co=
llom.

 =20

Jack Collom was born in Chicago=2C Illinois=2C 8 November 1931=2C
and grew up in nearby Western Springs.=20
He walked a lot in Salt Creek Woods and began bird watching at age 11.
He joined the U.S. Air Force and wrote his first poems in Tripoli=2C Libya.=
  He earned an MA in English on the GI
Bill=2C and has taught Creative Writing free-lance for over thirty years. H=
e is
Adjunct Professor at Naropa University=2C where he received the 2001 Presid=
ent=92s
Award for Faculty and has been teaching Eco-lit (Ecology Literature) for 19
consecutive years=2C as well as outreach teacher-training.=20

 =20

Collom has authored 22 books and chapbooks of poetry. He is=2C
moreover=2C responsible for three collections (with essays and commentary) =
of
writings by children=2C all published by Teachers & Writers Collaborative=
=2C
New York.  In 2001=2C Tuumba Press
issued a more than 500-page-long volume=2C Red Car Goes By=2C as his Select=
ed
Poems. His latest books are Exchanges of Earth & Sky and Situations=2C Sing=
s
(with Lyn Hejinian).

 =20

Jack Collom long ago rejected the notion that a distinction
is to be made between the quotidian and the poetic. There is poetry everywh=
ere.
But to find poetry everywhere means that one is incessantly engaged with th=
e
world at the level of poetry=85. His attention to surprise is pronounced bu=
t
never programmatic. The result is (as Merrill Gilfillan has phrased it) =93=
the
dance and weave between fierce notation and ceilingless song.=94 from Edito=
rs=92
Preface to Red Car Goes By.

http://amyking.wordpress.com/2009/07/16/poetry-events-calendars/=20

However, I will add the calendar to at least two more online venues such as=
 Red Room and Goodreads, and perhaps others, once the calendar is a little =
more filled out.=A0 I don't have time at the moment, but it seems there are=
 a few major cities and small town series that have been omitted.=A0 Please=
 feel free to backchannel addt'l suggestions or post them in the comments t=
o be added to the list.=A0 Once I've added more over the next few days, I'l=
l duplicate the listing for others who don't venture to my blog.

Thanks to all who chipped in and provided links!=A0 Hopefully this resource=
 will serve those on the hunt for live poetry for a long time!

Best,

Amy

Appropriate to the title of your book, the last concert I attended was
Robert Randolph and the Family Band. He seems to be mostly admired by the
jam band scene. I went because I am a fervent fan of the so-called "sacred
steel" music.

I wasn't disappointed. He played Glenn Lee's "Joyful Sounds."  I think there
are very few opportunities to hear that piece of music live. Glenn Lee's
song is probably my favorite recording I have ever heard. It is a piece of
music where each moment is better than the next. When the song starts to
fade out it becomes jaw droppingly good, I would really love to hear the
full unedited recording. Pesky fade out.

You can download the song here for $1:

too many people forget pleasure. sure, poetry is hard work, but sweating out a poem is still fun. a big disappointment if the poem is a complete failure, but fun almost always happens at some point during the shaping, & considering the $$$$ rewards, who'd write the stuff if this were not the case?

Hard to say where one "poem" ends and the next begins.

Don't forget pleasure -- pleasure in language, pleasure in structuring the
"poem," referencing experience.

(Almost all of reading, for me; and a good part of my writing.)

before essaying to "answer the question" isn't it perhaps necessary to firs=
t
ask some questions of oneself, of the speaker, of the audience, of the
readers?

What Power, whose Power and where from, and how, and why--
Who Speaks--the One Presumed to Know-- to one so that there is the pressure
to respond as though the question itself is unquestioningly a question whic=
h
one must ask of oneself and others? of Poetry?

Is the very asking of and response to the question not in itself a form of
informing one of one's inadequacy, one's failure in not asking the question
oneself without being told to do so?

That is, that at the center of the question is the unquestioning belief in
its Truth, in the manner of fiction readers and their "willing suspension o=
f
disbelief?

In other words, before even asking questions of the question, one is
immediately acquiescing to its terms of inadequacy, failure, abjectness,
defeat, being crushed down being obedient--not asking questions but being a
"model prisoner/worker"--

From the start, one accepts the designations offered by these questions and
the either/or set up it projects on to oneself . . . .

Might not the inadequacy the failure or the success in a sense being with
asking why  is  it that one accepst the voice of the questioern as
Authority, and why it is one unquestioningly "follows it," allows it to
define the range of one's possibilities of existence--within such a narrow
confinement--

Does the question and ones' responses to it in fact have anything to do wit=
h
"Poetry"--
Is not the question about Who What and Where has the Power to prevent
persons from asking How, Why?--

To paraphrase Emerson:

"The failure and inadequacy one sees in poetry is within one's own eye."

What sort of success --or failure--is one thinking of, desiring, demanding
for?

To be known, recognized in one's lifetime?  And when that is dubiously or
not  achieved, to think of the inadequacy of poetry--or perhaps the
inadequacy of the thinkers, critics, taste makers, publishers of poetry--

What are the standards one sets oneself for one's own person to decide if
one has failed or not?

Do the applause and notice of others count the most  in the scale of
achievement?

I think the best example there is of a poet finding poetry inadequate to th=
e
tasks he demands of it is Rimbaud.
He stopped writing poetry and "became somebody else."

Emile Nelligan, sometimes called the Quebecois/Canadian Rimbaud--for his
talent evinced at an early age--also called it quits with poetry and
committed himself to an asylum for the rest of hislife.

Many are the poets around the world who left behind them one book, unnotice=
d
in their time, and stopped writing, turning   instead to other activities.

Paul Valery, George Oppen, "left poetry" for decades each, only to return
later in life to finding in poetry what they had no found elsewhere.
Laura Riding left Poetry but wrote about it in prose--

What does one mean by "inadequacy?" In the las tpoem in his Larry Eigner's
first published book (by the Creeleys, in Majorca)-ends with the question
which has Rimbaud's "literally and in every other sense"  of  meanings
expressed simultaneously, punning----"am I an incompetent after all?"

In the 1980's there was argae in Art Criticism for the concept of the
"abject." is the poetic "inadequacy" related to the abject?
Think of al the meanings of the word "inadequacy," their contexts--their
allusions--their expression as "received ideas--"

What is the motivation for one to choose to find poetry, and/or  one's
poetry-- inadequate, a failure?

Is this the choice of the poet, or of the poet vi-vis the recognition she
receives from others, one's sense of one's work as inadequate, a failure?

How much does the recognition even when negative mean to you, poet--

Does one write for an audience only--for oneself only--

Does one want to be ignored but also "known of"--or even "fairly well
known--"--" a cult figure?--"

"A minor writer with major ambitions s/he is an example of those who
overshot the reach of their abilities."

"A major poet in the guise of a minor---"

Personally, i think the idea of merely stating the failure or inadequacy of
poetry as though "everyone knows what it means"--is to begin from a
foundation that is hazy, vague, and unsteady --.

Needn't the terms be treated with more precision, , defined more
clearly--perhaps find themselves to be "as yet unknown and/or little
understood?"

Are failure and/or inadequacy and al the examples given anything different
from the Received Ideas like those in Flaubert's dictionary of these?

Is the discussion being held because of the failure and inadequate in
thinking up any other topic to address?

Is the failure one receives from "outside" directly or indirectly or not  a=
t
all related to the success or failure of the works on the inside of the
poet--

Who gives the critic and canon maker, the taste maker the noise maker, the
One Presumed to Know the right to be the judge of the works, of the
poet--doesn't one  just sign away one's rights in terms of what will be the
controlling factor in many ways of what it is to be essaying as a career--

For this is the question that needs also to be asked:  iso ne speaking of a
poet's CAREER--or of their VOCATION--

Isn't it a sign of the careerism associated with these rankings, "failures,=
"
inadequacies " that one is required in some way to 'take al these into
account?"

The question is--to whom are these questions addressed--primarily career
poets who read the Harriett blog, the primarily academic  /white collar
readers--

and aren't many of these institutions, careers, ultimately dependent not so
much on the failure or success of the work or ine's failure or success in
terms of anthologies, papers,
but heavil dependence as well  on the moneys of priavte foundations, the
military, sweatshop labor for corporations assuaging guilt by helping to pa=
y
for a program or two- "on the failure of poetry?"

If enough poets are convinced they have failed--what shall they do
then--where to seek elsewhere for anew kind of career--

or to restart the career by "radically altering one's approach"--

What motives do these questions discussions have on, vis-a-vis with--this
boredom and confinement within institutions, hierarchies within grou'ps,'
rigid structures of al kinds in society and poetics that hamper and
drastically narrow done one's field ot action or thought, s
o that within this very narrow limited aperture, one is gauged by the meres=
t
slips of tense as to the success or failure of one's fitting in or not to
hose deemed worth recognition--or to be sadly among those shipped off into
the snow to die--or simply exiled to inferior jobs and non noticed careers
which in themselves may make the once poet give it up for some other more
intereting and "profitable"   hobby so called--

With so man questions of these kinds, whais usefu to keep i mind is-what is
the motivation for the question?
What is the motivation for this rarticular writer NOW to ask it and to make
his own judgements on their determinations--

One might say that the most overlooked thing is that the asking of the
question re failure and inadequacy is accepted as a given.

Aren't often the things most in need of questioning toese that persons and
poets accept meekly as givens, things 'everyone knows"--"automatically,
without saying?"

In one sense  is not a person''s asking the question based on others taking
it as a given property of poetry to be judged as a success or inadequate, a
failure by oneself and/or others-
-is this asking of questions re "failure/success" based on what one takes t=
o
be givens that al 'accept"--
or on a self-imposed given?

i've been writing a graphic synthesizer/langu(im)age processor called
dbCinema and, recently, dbCinemizing with some images of Olga, the Vancouver
fashion model and book maker--as in artists' books and regular books. i've
read one of her books called Soros. the writing is by Kedrick James. Olga's
visuals are Russian Constructivistic. It's a real page turner!  Soros was
hanged before his first meeting with Soros on January 6 1990. Soros will
give no choice but to award them enough divergence to go wrong. By June of
1993 Soros was against this time. Of course it helps if you know a little of
the Soros story.

the dbCinema series on Olga is at http://vispo.com/dbcinema/olga

i think these are rather intense.

Many thanks to Olga for permission to display these on vispo.com. And to
Miles de Courcy, the photographer, and Katherine Soucie, the dress designer.

In Internet Explorer and Opera the series stops around image 470 (of 581
images) on my system. Works fine in Safari and Firefox, however. Opera will
display all images if you increase the disk cache size in Preferences. But I
can't get Internet Explorer to display all the images, on my system. So I
recommend you don't use that browser. Too bad. Used to be a good browser.
But it's now the Bush administration of browsers: mad with security issues.
Overkill. No fun. Forces of dullness. If yer on a PC, the F11 key toggles
yer browser fullscreen and back. All the images are 1280 x 1024 pixels, so
they probly take up all yer real estate.

The first pass through the images is relatively slow as it downloads the big
images one by one. But that is well-suited to a first viewing: each of the
images is meant as something viewable as a still. When all of them have
downloaded, it speeds up to 12.5 frames per second (if yer puter is up to
the job) and so you see it in a different light, as a high-res, 47 second
video. and it is quite different this way.

the controls at top left let you pause it on and off and advance by one
image or go back one image. you can also change the delay between images.

it is meant to be experienced this way, rather than simply as a video that
plays with no interactivity.

There are more dbCinema image series at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm

I agree with that.
But you can say you were there.
That's the main thing, I think.

I love Rashied Ali. My favourite drummer.
I heard him with the Aylers around 1967
]and I heard him in Vancouver last year.
I didn't know he did concerts, though.

Some older Net history - this is a bookmark file I kept from 1995 to maybe
ten years ago; some, perhaps most, of the sites are down, but the file
itself seems of interest since a lot of the sites were 'historic' one way
or another. Enjoy if you can -

Hi, Michael. Tthese are interesting questions. Though I also wonder
why we apply terms like *success* & *failure* to poetry, & when we do
so who is speaking to & for whom & whether, in defining these terms,
we are thinking about intent or affect or a combination of the two or
perhaps even a third, more useful term. There are so many approaches
to the notion of failure in poetry, & (surely this is why you've
asked) Christian's is only one. I've begun to think through my own at
the Toadlily Press Blog, if you are interested:

http://toadlilypress.com/toadlily-blog/.

Cheers,
Emily

Yes, I agree. And some of my best poems have been unexpected "works of geni=
us." I love writing and finding the unexpected as I wrte. If it is too easy=

My understanding is that colleges and universities are doing well during th=

"The Bauhaus: 90 Years / 90 Days" is a new project which commemorates the
90th anniversary of the Bauhaus. Every day during this 90-day project (from
July 6 till October 3), a project happens which creatively plays around with
and pays homage to an aspect of the Bauhaus. Examples of those projects
might include a dance performance inspired by Oskar Schlemmer's ballet, a
musical performance that uses a Kandinsky painting as a graphic score, a
fiber art project inspired by Anni Albers' work, a poem inspired by Walter
Gropius' architecture, a short story inspired by Marianne Brandt's work, an
essay reflecting on an aspect of the Bauhaus movement, and so on.

I will take any suggestions b/c.

GIOVANNI'S ROOM BOOKSTORE in Philadelphia is the world's largest
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered, Feminist bookstore.  The
catalog of titles it holds for us is staggering, and no where in any
brick and mortar store, independent or corporate, can we find all
these titles together to browse whenever we want, to purchase whenever
we want.  I worked at the store for nearly 7 years, and its importance
for LGBT and feminist readers around the world was something I felt,
and took seriously when it was felt.

While independent bookstores have been disappearing, none have been
disappearing as quickly as queer/feminist bookstores.  Corporate
bookstores WILL NOT carry ALL these titles for you to discover.  I
remember a woman coming into the store who was 78 years old, and had
been married, had children, and was now wanting to come out of the
closet.  The Coming Out section of books is unlike any other in the
world, and I also showed her the video NITRATE KISSES.  I forget what
she purchased, but I remember feeling, truly feeling the importance of
Giovanni's Room Bookstore at helping create a place for this woman who
was older than my grandmothers.

The store has survived MANY tough times, including bricks being thrown
through the windows.  The bricks from these hate crimes now line the
owner's garden.  Edwin Hermance, Skip, and all their amazing staff and
volunteers are facing an enormous crisis.  Major reconstruction is
about to take place on the store's one wall, and it will cost A LOT of
money.  Edwin and Skip and all the staff want you to PLEASE shop at
the store to help them in this time of need.  IF THERE ARE BOOKS YOU
WANT but cannot find, they WILL order them for you.  Below is a note
from Edwin Hermance with many more details.  Please shop at Giovanni's
Room, for all our sake!  CAConrad

-------------
from Edwin Hermance, owner of Giovanni's Room Bookstore

Giovanni's Room, the oldest independent LGBT bookstore in the United
States today, needs your help and support to survive. Our 12th St.
wall, which is structurally unsound, must be taken down and rebuilt
from the ground up; construction will begin by sometime in August. The
cost of this renovation, roughly $50,000, will not be easily paid;
independent bookstores, lgbt bookstores included, have never been that
profitable. Our store's success is measured by the people Giovanni's
Room has helped in an almost limitless number of ways and by the
exposure we have given to authors and publishers, filmmakers and
musicians.

This will be a delicate time in the store's history. We need your
support more than ever, and the store will remain open during the
construction. Here is what we are asking you to do:

*Continue to shop at Giovanni's Room despite the challenges.
*Order in person, online, by email, and by phone.
*Show your support!

We have often faced adversity. In the beginning, in 1973, we had
hardly any books to sell and the store was staffed 100% by volunteers.
When homophobic landlords evicted us from the Spruce Street location
and no one, on a major street, would rent to Giovanni's Room, we were
able to raise the down payment for the current location by borrowing
from you, our customers. Over 100 volunteers helped renovate the
building to make the beautiful space we have occupied since 1979.

Now, at this defining juncture, we have formed a Committee that will
be addressing fundraising, volunteers, special community and author
events, and other activities to help meet the cost of this repair.

Keep gay heritage alive. Volunteer your time - make a financial
pledge! Your support to Giovanni's Room will help us survive our 36th
year.

Edwin Hermance

------------
HOPE YOU MAKE IT OVER TO GIOVANNI'S ROOM!  LET'S KEEP THIS PLACE ALIVE!

Dear mIEKAL:

many thanks for forwarding this

there is the example of the Guantanamo Poets, whose works went through alon=
g
and literally "tortuous process" including which poems were cleared and how
they were translated;the poems were done by order of the Army by
non-literary translators.  Every attempt was made to suppress anything that
might in any way be considered to be carrying hidden messages to the outsid=
e
world.  Poetry after al with "poetic language" which can be interpreted man=
y
different ways, would seem to be a possible way of spreading propaganda or
messages to relatives, organized groups,journalists, etc.
here are two essay/reviews  which are re the Guantanamo and a flickr  of
visual poetry

in the US in the last few years a very large number of cultural events been
canceled or forced to find other homes, if possible--predominately anything
Palestinian or connected with Palestine-Israel and exhibitions like that of
a Jewish Cultural center in Chicago which are perceived  by a person or
group that finds anything remotely "critical of Israel" being
expressed.(outside the US called "the New McCarthyism"

This is a report of Opening Night for this year's Palestinian Festival of
Literature in Jerusalem.  The Closing Night--the poets toured in
between--was also banned; the British Consulate intervened and the Festival
continued in their Consulate.

also at my blog there are videos, photostream, morei nformations on the
poets and their tour-  several of the poets are Palestinian-Americans livin=
g
in the US--there are also interviews with the poets

On opposite sides of the world, two"democracies"  are banning not only
poetry but many other kinds of "Free Speech"--
below is the tittle and address for a post that arrived today from Jewish
Peace Mews--two articles and a great many links--re the trials of the
outspoken in many different areas of life and the stifling of Free Speech
within Israel--

the reason given in UK, USA, Israel and many other countries for an
"assault"  on their own laws regarding Freedom of Expression as well as
breaking International Laws to forbid freedom of  Expression in other
countries--
the reason always given is "Security"

to make YOU more secure --the State will dispossess YOU of increasingly mor=
e
rights--
making "more secure" the individual citizen is effectively finding a way to
secure them with a "security state"--the population as a whole becomes
prisoners of the State controlling their lives-

Monday, May 25, 2009 Palfest 09: Culture vs. Power The Guardian reports
today that armed Israeli police last night tried to halt the opening night
of the Palestinian Festival of Literature, organised by Ahdaf Soueif, when
they ordered a Palestinian theatre in East Jerusalem to close, claiming tha=

the festival - which is funded by the British Council and UNESCO - had
received funding from the Palestinian Authority. Soueif writes on Palfest's

Hello, lady people! Pigeons are good.
Winter is good. Stoolpigeons are good---
thought they're in league with the government,
trying to kill all spontaneity.
Hello everyone! Time to start losing.
Losing is good. Losing is what we came
here to do, and it's going quite well,
thanks for asking.

i'm sure 'spiritual materialism' could mean any number of um things. that's
part of its poetical if not philosophical appeal, as poetry is the art of
being profoundly vague. so one doesn't like to 'disambiguate' too strongly.

however, here's a bit more about what i had in mind. others will have their
own, different notions of what it might mean.

many of us, as writers and/or artists or whatever, find ourselves working
with 'the material' in ways that we weren't earlier on. with less emphasis
on transcribing our 'inner thoughts and feelings' and more emphasis on what
the words are saying. and yes there are often things we want to get them to
say, if we can (like now), but we observe that not only are we not entirely
clear what that might be, until we find the words, but that even when we do,
they aren't quite what we thought they might be and are often better as
something we didn't anticipate at all via not mindless manipulation of
symbols but through a process of writerly/artistic discovery that involves
mind and mindless, material and material, material and spiritual. via
engaging with the material both in an objective manner, as things on a page
subject to choice and cutup, random and thoughtful selection...and all the
compositional techniques we use.

and this different engagement with 'the material' is part of what i had in
mind as a kind of materialism. of course the term 'materialism' has a very
interesting history going back to Indian and Greek atomism and into the
contemporary world in many different ways. usually the 'material' is
atomistic. matter. a philosophy of the composition of matter and the
generation of the ten thousand things.

only recently has it been associated with consumerist zeal and denials of
the importance of feelings, emotions, and so on. a blip on the map.

usually there's a scientistic element, often a strong one, to materialisms.
they often seek to apply an occam-like razor to eliminate assumptions that
are not required or attribute causes to supernatural agents. materialisms
usually do their darndest to appeal only to reason and material evidence in
their theories.

but of course, as artists, we are by no means in the bizness of appealing
solely to reason. we don't produce many theories of the universe and
everything but, instead, are basically wordy minstrels singing into the
black hole of mind and media. and, for lack of a better word, there is a
'spiritual' dimension to what we talk about, what we do, how we go about it,
and so on. emotion, feeling, mood, tone, connotation, subjectivity, all
these are normally important to art.

yet our approach, or the approach of many of us, to writing and/or art or
whatever, in our current age, does involve this 'materialism' i mentioned
that does indeed have a scientistic dimension in that we do try to keep our
eye somewhat objectively not on what we ourselves are feeling and thinking
about what we're creating but on what others might also get from it and,
beyond that, in our approach to working with the material as recombinant, as
involved in the processes of network cutup, reassembly, and our sources of
the material can be spam or texts recovered from net searches or whatever
and our methods of composition can involve the algorithmic and so on.
kedrick james's term for all this is 'writing post-person'.

but, even so, we are not so much interested in creating interesting language
machines as in the human appeal of these machines made out of words. so that
a contemporary, writerly materialism usually involves some sort of
meditation on our relations with language and machines. not to dehumanize
but to locate and explore our humanity in relation to mind and mindlessness,
the intention and the unintended, the machine and the human.

there's that kurzweil book 'the age of spiritual machines'. with emphasis on
artificial intelligence. and that's interesting, but typically our emphasis
is not on artificial intelligence but on our own intelligence extended,
changed, dwarfed, zoomed, augmented, pounded, filtered, twittered,
frittered, coerced, directed, freed, drugged, blasted, spliced, diced,
googled, ogled, bamboozled, frugalled, layered, informationalized, playered,
stirred, blurred, penetrated, iconized, infiltrated, visualized, datafied,
search enginized, tokenized, blip bopified, ding donglered and piece-wise
transformed via our engagement with language and contemporary language
environments. our own intelligences are somewhat artificial. and we operate
in a material combinatorium of language not as in a meaningless concourse of
atoms but in our own very purposefully processual cyclotrons, intent upon
both the material and energy of its release.

I have not read everything in insidehighered, but I think that what I said was misunderstood by you, based on what I did read. I am not saying that careers are doing well in higher ed. I am saying that there are adjunct semester by semester jobs available because when the economy is bad, people go back to college. I am talking about surivival mode, not tenure. I am now a tenured instructor at a technical/community college in the midwest. We are not currently hiring tenure track positions, but I can say that we will be hiring adjunct positions. I have done the adjunct route, and I know that it is not ideal and I know that it is very frustrating for people with PhDs. (I have two lowly Master's degrees from a state university.) However, I do know that adjunct teaching is a better position than selling shoes at Kohl's, which was another option for me about 12 years ago. I can also understand that working as an adjunct and wondering if your bills will be paid
 causes a great deal of stress because I have also dealt with that stress. I was supporting my two children and myself from semester to semester with very little child support from their dad ($100/month). In a very bad economy, I am saying that it is better than many other possible scenarios. Sometimes you just have to suck it up.

ROCKPILE is a collaboration between David Meltzer =97 poet, musician, =20=

essayist, and more =97 and Michael Rothenberg of Big Bridge Press. David =
=20
and Michael will journey through eight cities in the U.S. to perform =20
poetry and prose, composed while on the road, with local musicians and =20=

artists in each city. ROCKPILE will serve to educate and preserve as =20
well as to create a history of collaboration. It will help to =20
reinforce the tradition of the troubadour of all generations, central =20=

to the cultural upheaval and identity politics that reawakened poets, =20=

artists, musicians, and songwriters in the mid-1960s through the =20
1970s. The project will end with a final multimedia performance =20
celebration in San Francisco.

The ROCKPILE Website & Blog will tell you all you need to know about =20
the ROCKPILE project including performance dates, venues, artist bios =20=

and performance clips of some of the musicians we will be meeting and =20=

performing with in each of the cities.

Once we hit the road, we will be posting  travel photos, journal =20
entries, performance videos, interviews and more, daily, on the =20
ROCKPILE Blog, so log on and join us as we travel around the country. =20=

Write us, comment on the blog, and let us know you are with us, let us =20=

know you care!

And of course, we hope to see you on the road!

Best,

so, with Auden, suppose that "Poetry makes nothing happen."

or, as Charles Simic points out: "The act of torture consist of various str=
ategies/meant to increase/ the imagination of homo sapiens."

=A0it seems as though we're left with little more than irony.
besides pleasure, what can poetry offer?

perhaps the one successful didatic poet of the 20th century, Bertold Brecht=
, said it best:

All roads led into the mire in my time.
My tongue betrayed me to the butchers.
There was little I could do. But those in power
Sat safer withut me: that was my hope.
So passed my time
Which hadbeen given to me on earth.

Thursday, July 23 7PM to 10PM at The Cameo Theatre (located in the old Cruises Only building - 1013 E. Colonial Drive), Team Orlando 2009 will face off against three other teams packed with amazing poets in a National Poetry Slam style bout where, after four rounds, one team will win the first ever Showdown in O-Town. Our teams are so far:

Team Orlando 2009: Shawn Welcome, Curtis Meyer, Ronin, MyVerse, Alex Ruiz - the most talented team Orlando will ever throw at the National Poetry Slam thus far. This is an amazing mix of accomplished poets and hungry newcomers who will rock your faces off with their poetic might.

Team Slamazon: Kendra Corrie, Dani O., Veronica Smith, Holly Riggs - this team features both winners of the 2009 Fringe Poetry Smackdown (who both won with 30s), a 2009 Smackdown runner up, and a poetic leviathan emerging from the depths. This steam is fierce. They will destroy you with their verse, then wear your skin like a pelt.

Team Payback: Tod Caviness, Trevor Fraiser, Tam Tam the Sandwich Man, Alex Vega - all these poets were part of the Broken Speech Post-Season and they seek vengenance on Team Orlando for denying them from representing the City Beautiful.

Team Pandemonium : Chaz Yorick, Lilly, Michael Sloan, Zachary Kluckman - this team is the ultimate wildcard. We can only speculate the mayhem this mysterious group can cause.

These teams will face Team Orlando at the Showdown in O-Town in an epic bout never seen before in the City Beautiful...until now.

And we have a super special feature to kick off the show - individual National Poetry Slam Champion and individual World Poetry Slam Champion Mighty Mike McGee.

Wanna hear the best part? You can see this National Poetry Slam style bout with a side of legendary for just $5. $5 to see amazing poetry. $5 to get your face rocked so far off, you can put it on a wall as a trophy to tell your grandchildren about that time poetry rocked your face off on this night. For your $5, you not only get to witness awesome poetry but get your name thrown in the hat for a door prize: a $25 gift card to Urban Think, Orlando's only independent book store. All proceeds go to Team Orlando 2009.

"Chicago Bauhaus in July"

Saturday, July 25 (3-6 p.m.)

at Acme Art Works



You are invited to attend "Chicago Bauhaus in July," which features poetry
and micro-fiction readings, an art talk, musical performances, a discussion
about the Michael Reese Hospital, a "Metallic Fest" workshop, and a
conversation about a new Cairo-Chicago project initiative. The purposes of
"Chicago Bauhaus in July" are to creatively explore the Bauhaus spirit, and
to raise awareness about the current effort to preserve the buildings on the
Michael Reese Hospital campus.



* * *



Al DeGenova, Jamie Kazay, Charlie Newman, and Larry Sawyer read selections
of their poetry.



David Boykin performs a set of solo percussion.



Amanda Marbais reads several micro-fiction pieces.



Members of the Gropius in Chicago Coalition give a presentation about the
ongoing campaign to preserve the buildings designed by Bauhaus founder
Walter Gropius, on the Michael Reese Hospital campus.



performance by Amalgamating --

Paul Hartsaw -- tenor saxophone

Dan Godston -- trumpet

Alex Wing -- drums

Jerome Bryerton -- drums



Bert Stabler gives a talk about how his artwork has been influenced by
Bauhaus artists Paul Klee and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.



Houreya Elsayed and Dan Godston talk about the Cairo-Chicago project, via
skype.

"Metallic Festival" workshop



In 1929, the Bauhaus hosted a Metallic Festival, during which participants
dressed up in metal outfits. Part of the impetus behind that was the
Bauhaus' insistence that industrialization could be playful. Also, Bauhaus
artist/choreographer Oskar Schlemmer created "Metal Dance," which explored
metal as a material that has remarkable light-reflecting properties.
Participants of the "Metallic Festival" workshop will design metal costumes,
as well as have the opportunity to make hand-sculpted metal objects (such as
hats and miniature buildings). Also, musicians will interact with the sounds
of amplified metal, during a several-minute improvised piece.



$5 suggested donation, sliding scale



This event is hosted by the Near Northwest Arts Council at Acme Art Works,
and it is co-organized by the Borderbend Arts Collective and the Gropius in
Chicago Coalition.

It is as completely unrelated to dianetics as one could possibly be, trust =
me. The term is Greek. Dia- means through, and physics from physis, meaning=
 nature. "Through the levels of nature." That's diaphysics. =0A=0ATroy=0A=

Weirdly enough, I am moving to NYC just as Amy sees her friends and poets
losing jobs.  There has to be a way that people can form a group or
organization, or as Duncan said somewhere--create the free association of
mutual interests--to put all this corporate/institutionally-squandered
skill, smarts, agility and amazing perception to work, and meaningfully so.
We know why the economy is derailed, but why not start making work by making
something new that people are actively interested and engaged in--not
anything already done to death, or that bores us into paralysis--

I just hate to think of how many people out there are seemingly idled by a
brain-stalled system, failed promises, and the sluggish, backwards logic of
our education system.  and i'm sick of getting emails that start out "wish I
had better news to give you about our department...the economy" blah blah
blah.

yuck,
doug

Copy editing work is tough, but its always a good place to start into the p=
ublishing field. The company I work for Beacon Premedia Global is growing a=
nd hiring. I work on the American Physical Society's journal APR D: Particl=
es, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology. (Absolutely fascinating research on=
 the nature of dark matter being done right now). I could give you contact =
information if you like. It's twenty hours a week, work from home, ten hour=
s have to be done 9-5 and the rest are flex, pay is anywhere between 11 and=
 13 and hour depending on experience, 60 hours PTO.=20

Let me know if you are interested.

Weirdly enough, I am moving to NYC just as Amy sees her friends and poets
losing jobs.=A0 There has to be a way that people can form a group or
organization, or as Duncan said somewhere--create the free association of
mutual interests--to put all this corporate/institutionally-squandered
skill, smarts, agility and amazing perception to work, and meaningfully so.
We know why the economy is derailed, but why not start making work by makin=
g
something new that people are actively interested and engaged in--not
anything already done to death, or that bores us into paralysis--

I just hate to think of how many people out there are seemingly idled by a
brain-stalled system, failed promises, and the sluggish, backwards logic of
our education system.=A0 and i'm sick of getting emails that start out "wis=
h I
had better news to give you about our department...the economy" blah blah
blah.

yuck,

The cost of our dead poets society

http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jul/23/keats-house-funding

The enormous sums spent on dead authors' houses should be used to
support those with few other chances to write

Keats House in Hampstead, the low pale villa where the poet lived, has
been renovated and will be opened to the public tomorrow. It is
proudly proclaimed to be the house where he penned Ode to a
Nightingale and asked the girl next door to marry him. Yet Keats lived
there for just two years, albeit his most creative. It prompts the
question =96 does this postcard-pretty house of a writer who died at 26,
which will attract those who like visiting pretty houses in Hampstead,
deserve a =A3424,000 grant by the Heritage Lottery Fund, supplemented by
the Corporation of London?

Let's contrast the apparent ease of finding the money for the young
man Keats with the struggles over Mrs Gaskell, whose former house is
at 84 Plymouth Grove, Ardwick, Manchester. It is a Grade II*-listed
Regency-style villa, and it is on the English Heritage buildings at
risk register. The Gaskell Society says it needs over =A32m to save it,
yet it has secured just =A3260,000, covering the first phase of
renovation. I hope the society does not find the rest of the money;
let the house rot and wilt and tumble down. These houses of the
well-read dead signify only the self-importance of the literary
society, waving the bowl to feed the cult of the author.

I used to live in Ardwick, and knew the Gaskell house long before I
knew of her, or read anything by her. For years I walked by, to and
from school, in total ignorance. Yet, while I became sympathetic to
the didactic aims of her works, which make her of far higher social
importance than Keats, and may explain her relative neglect, I would
rather see the energies of these literary societies channelled
differently. Dare they turn their gazes from the dead to the living?

The Gaskell Society declares that "the restoration of the building
will act as a flagship for the regeneration of a socially
disadvantaged area". This is a repulsive sentiment =96 the girls of
nearby Moss Side need more than Mrs Gaskell's bricks to inspire them =96
and it is hard not to think that the fundraisers are leeching off the
"socially disadvantaged" label of the area that has grown up around
it.

But by ditching these shrines to dead writers, they could begin to
make a real difference to living ones. Gaskell made her fortune and
reputation writing about downtrodden women. Ardwick has plenty of
them, many of whom could be finding their own literary voice. Ardwick
needs youth centres and libraries and creative writing groups, where
these woefully under-represented working-class women can be
encouraged. Then we would have a richer and more diversified
literature =96 actually penned by those that live it.

Let us find ways of encouraging potential writers. Then I will give
you an area that will be its own social regeneration. Because it is
the works that matter, not which room the author squatted in,
twiddling her hair and sucking the end of her quill. I'm sure that Mrs
Gaskell would agree.

1- My new experimental, sound, visual  poetry work "An Iranian Rose is
an Iranian Rose is an Iranian Rose" / 2009 (
http://arteonline.arq.br/neda/ ) is participating of the Project
Pantea's Rose by Deb King

July 25th is a  'Global Day of Action in Unity with the People of Iran.'

Pantea's Rose intends to be a simple show of solidarity, of shared
humanity, with the mothers, fathers and children, the artists,
academics and working people of Iran.  Considering the importance the
internet has been to the Iranian people's communication with the
outside world,  a net action take place is particularly appropriate.

On NPR this morning Scott Simon asked a novelist how the Internet has=
 affected writing. He responded that he now finds it difficult to read=
 writers like Henry James because he has grown unaccustomed to complicated=
 syntax and longer, more developed arguments and that a movement needs to=
 be started like the Slow Foods Movement that he called Slow Language. He=
 said that poetry constitutes slow language.

--Lisa Joyce

p.s. It took me a long time to write this message but, sadly, I write it=
 from a long distance from any other readers. Does Slow Language, like Slow=
 Foods, need to embrace the local and the locally produced?

Dominic McIver Lopes has a book coming out in August called A Philosophy of
Computer Art; info at http://www.apoca.mentalpaint.net . I see a précis at
http://aesthetics-online.org/articles/index.php?articles_id=40

He teaches Philosophy in Vancouver. Nice to have a different sort of
approach to these matters. A philosopher.

And he talks about my piece Seattle Drift. In which the basic philosophy is
'do me'. Which, come to think of it, fits in with his philosophy, which
stresses computation and interactivity in 'computer art', which he
distinguishes from 'digital art'.

A useful distinction. Just about all art, these days, is involved in the
digital. Even dance and the most print-minded endeavors of the literary. the
most fundamental phenomenological characteristic of computers is
programmability. this is what separates computers from other types of
man-made machines. 'turing-complete' programmability provides a radical
flexibility in what machines can do. flexibility so radical that there is no
proof, and probably never will be, that there exist thought processes of
which humans are capable and computers are not.

there probably never will be such proof because if such proof existed, it
would mean that there was proof that there are types of machines that go
beyond the capabilities of turing machines. and such proof has been sought
since the early days of computing, to no avail.

what does this mean for computer art?

well, there are many artists who see computers as glorified media machines.
glorified typewriters. or glorified sound editing facilities. and so on.
more of the same only easier and better. so their notion of computer art
does not go very far. we shall have more of the same from them. because that's
what you get when you think of computers as glorified old-media machines.
and of course we're getting lots of it.

whereas if we see computers as offering really quite radical possibilities,
possibilities that are poetentially as flexible as thought itself in dynamic
generation, then we have to revise our notions concerning the vistas of
computer art. and not settle for more of the same.

programming that is not interactive can be very interesting, of course. it
can also be made to respond to the surroundings or remote data in ways that
aren't interactive with the audience but are nonetheless involved in growth
and change, learning and possibly even thought of some sort. and that can be
interesting in art pieces.

but i agree with Lopes that there is something special to *interactivity
with people* in computer art. really good interactivity brings modes of
discovery that are most interesting to me, among works of computer art.
there can be a kind of dialogue or communication that is deeply satisfying
as an art experience. perhaps because this sort of communication most
dramatically and immediately explores our relations with machines and each
other and ourselves. we get an inkling of some form of thought and
communication that is a deep mixture of human thought and emotion and
communication together with this new element we know is on the horizon of
thought, ie, the thought of machines.

Subject:      part: short life housing (review)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

just up on Chris Goode's highly estimable blog, following an excellent write
up on Tom Raworth's collected prose "Earn Your Milk" and sundry other items:

In a slightly different mode but no less vimful is cris cheek's part: short
life housing, a big event in itself but exciting also in that it's the first
item to arise in a fair while from Nate Dorward's excellent The Gig in
Toronto. This really handsome book collects work from the early 80s up to
the nearly present, and it's as good as introduction to cheek's work as you
could wish for without actually seeing & hearing him unleash the true
complexity of these works in performance. Having carried around this volume
with me for a while, jumping in and out of it, I begin to see how (for me,
right now) it reflects my own interest in the practice of place-ma(r)king in
performance, a practice that can be lived in, that's not some reflective
treetop or secluded glade, but a grimy, spunky, urban site whose churning,
whirling multiplicities contain actual life behaviours, not just mimickings
or courtroom sketches of these. The language here is able to be both
edificial and viral, to jump (somewhat as theatre does, but free of some of
theatre's topical responsibilities) between testimony and speculation; it is
a language containing a cast of thousands, but also never quite adding up to
one whole. To an extent this is a feature of the book as a whole: a kind of
nagging provisionality, equal to the degree in which text in cheek's work is
never just text, but is a participant in a whole playground (or workshop) of
presences and effects. For example, I'm glad, on encountering here the
fascinating canning town chronicles (from 1991-94) to know the CD of the
same name by Slant, cheek's group with Sianed Jones and Philip Jeck, which
terrifically effectively animates the same resources. Whether or not one
knows cris's performative practices, however, I'm certain anyone would
recognize the imperative embedded in all the works collected here to
approach reading as a whole-body practice, and as an enterprise made sense
of only in the context of collective action. The only possible reason I can
see for cheek never to have received the props he's due in British writing
networks is that he's scary like that. He needs you up on your feet: you
just can't think hard enough or fast enough to stick with him if you're
sitting down.

(Having said which, Jonny and I were lucky enough to spend some time hanging
out with cris during his recent UK visit -- he's based in the States now; we
miss him -- and there was a good measure of sedentary lolling in the hot
June weather. What started out as a quick lunch squeezed in between his
other appointments turned into a six hour marathon of anecdote and argument
and much laughter, which left a real impression of wanting to stay more
strongly connected to him than I've been of late. Eventually we adjourned to
the BFI for drinks: and as cris finally left us, striding off through the
bar, his imposing stature arguing productively with the lovely skirty kilty
thing he was wearing, and his bald head bobbing above the post-work throng,
we heard a slightly camp voice from the table behind us say: "Julius Caesar
has left the building." Quite so.)

Dear everyone,


I've had some discussions recently
following from a remark by a friend that the distinction between
visual art and poetry is reactionary, similarly to the hard and fast
distinction that used to be made between sculpure and painting.

Personally I can't help but thinking
that even though often the distinction is blurred, there remains an essential difference between the two; namely, that
visual art might, but need not use language, but for poetry, however widely
understood, language is an essential ingredient.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

Thanks and best, Jeroen

Nightingale and asked the girl next door to marry him. Yet Keats lived=20
there for just two years, albeit his most creative. It prompts the=20

26,=20

Let's contrast the apparent ease of finding the money for the young=20
man Keats with the struggles over Mrs Gaskell, whose former house is=20
at 84 Plymouth Grove, Ardwick, Manchester. It is a Grade II*-listed=20
Regency-style villa, and it is on the English Heritage buildings at=20
risk register. The Gaskell Society says it needs over =C2=A32m to save it,=
=20
yet it has secured just =C2=A3260,000, covering the first phase of=20
renovation. I hope the society does not find the rest of the money;=20
let the house rot and wilt and tumble down. These houses of the=20
well-read dead signify only the self-importance of the literary=20
society, waving the bowl to feed the cult of the author.=20

I used to live in Ardwick, and knew the Gaskell house long before I=20
knew of her, or read anything by her. For years I walked by, to and=20
from school, in total ignorance. Yet, while I became sympathetic to=20
the didactic aims of her works, which make her of far higher social=20
importance than Keats, and may explain her relative neglect, I would=20
rather see the energies of these literary societies channelled=20
differently. Dare they turn their gazes from the dead to the living?=20

The Gaskell Society declares that "the restoration of the building=20
will act as a flagship for the regeneration of a socially=20
disadvantaged area". This is a repulsive sentiment =E2=80=93 the girls of=
=20
nearby Moss Side need more than Mrs Gaskell's bricks to inspire them =E2=80=

and it is hard not to think that the fundraisers are leeching off the=20

Joe,

Would you have felt differently if the house was of a poet you thought more
highly of? I have a sense Keats ios not too high on your list of poets.

Are you the one who also posted about how Edith Wharton's House is losing
money?http://www.edithwharton.org/

<http://www.edithwharton.org/>"Thanks to the generosity of our supporters,
the co-operation of our principal creditors, and to a large gift from the
Alice M. Kaplan Memorial Reserve, The Mount has staved off the threat of
foreclosure that has recently threatened its existence."

It always annoyed me that Lowe's supports Biltmore and not The Mount, but
The Mount people really overestimated the appeal of Wharton and the
Berkshires, and never hit up serious interior design / construction money.

As opposed to The Mount, it seems that Gaskell's house is supposed to be
turned into a community center.  I think that sounds like a good use, rather
than teaching writing in soulless "youth centres," teaching writing in a
pretty house that local craftsmen helped restore.  I think everyone's
beginning to realize how public objects become landmarks.  That said,
"street view" of the existing community center indicates it is in yet
another tumbledown mansion.

The Keats house has been a museum since 1925.

Hi all,
i've got a new book out in the world. I urge you to support The Gig, a fine
fine press, and buy a copy. It's a handsome book and i'm very proud of it!

You can order thru SPD and Bridge Street Books too i hope.

I expect to be doing some live readings to promote it (so, erm. . . all
offers welcome ;-))



cris cheek
part: short life housing

This book collects seven texts written between 1981 and 1999, by UK-born,
US-based poet/multimedia artist cris cheek. cheek was one of the key figure=
s
in the London poetry scene of the 1980s =E2=80=94 the so-called
=E2=80=9Clinguistically-innovative poetry=E2=80=9D grouping later anthologi=
zed in Robert
Sheppard and Adrian Clarke=E2=80=99s Floating Capital: New Poets from Londo=
n.
Likewise, he became central to developments in Performance Writing emerging
out of variant distributed networks during the following decade. He has
remained a prolific, genre-slipping figure: poet, performance artist and
musician, whose activities range from the ambitious conceptual project
Things Not Worth Keeping to recordings with the ensembles Slant and Garam
Masala. Yet to date his publications have been relatively scarce and
elusive, a situation which part: short life housing goes far to rectify.

At the heart of this book are two long sequences, previously unpublished
aside from short extracts: =E2=80=9Ccanning town chronicles,=E2=80=9D a sca=
thing set of
verbal accretions that emerged from the wreckage of the Thatcher era; and =
=E2=80=9Cf
o g s,=E2=80=9D a series of typestracts quarried from verbal improvisations=
 recorded
during outdoor walks in densely foggy weather. Also included are several
shorter pieces, including a selection of early 1980s work and =E2=80=9Cplai=
n
speaking yet,=E2=80=9D cheek=E2=80=99s memorial to the novelist Kathy Acker=
. The poems have,
in keeping with the author=E2=80=99s concern for the specificity of occasio=
n and
publication, been revised and visually reimagined with this volume in mind.

*

For all its thickness, unanticipated moves, visual beauty, and playful
language acrobatics, the poetry of part: short life housing consistently
retains the edge of serious critique. There are few poets as attuned to the
sounds and ambient fogs of everyday life as cris cheek, yet his record is
tuned and sharply turned toward the reimagining of social knowledge. This
volume is a generous move towards the full representation of cheek=E2=80=99=
s crucial
project.
=E2=80=94 Carla Harryman

Finally a good and rich span of writings from cris cheek. Here=E2=80=99s an=
 artist
and writer whose work has always taken up active tenancy of the languages
and the streets of urban living, recording them and composing them back int=
o
the dense abstract neighbourhoods of his pieces. With this careful
selection, cris cheek reminds us that he is a Londoner and as such is as
inhabited by Dickens=E2=80=99 dark maze of industrial streets as by mind-al=
tering
years of activist art lodgings, smoggy thoughtful wanderings or the eerie
shock of the thatcheritic city. That=E2=80=99s at least two hundred years o=
f grime,
greed and energy you=E2=80=99ll find distilled in the cellular lines and in=
k
splashes of this great volume.

s ?=E2=80=9D cris
cheek is the Kepler of Chisenhale Dance Space. After a century of
developments in poetic form best understood as a series of metaphors for
transcribed speech, cheek=E2=80=99s poetry often actually is transcribed sp=
eech,
throwing shapes on the page that pay homage to (and lay the ghosts of) all
the dead metaphors. As in Alvin Lucier=E2=80=99s I Am Sitting in a Room, th=
e speech
in cheek=E2=80=99s work functions as something like echolocation: its refle=
ctions
(on him and in us) mapping out an ever more complex and multifocal shape fo=

On NPR this morning Scott Simon asked a novelist how the Internet has affected writing. He responded that he now finds it difficult to read writers like Henry James because he has grown unaccustomed to complicated syntax and longer, more developed arguments and that a movement needs to be started like the Slow Foods Movement that he called Slow Language. He said that poetry constitutes slow language.

p.s. It took me a long time to write this message but, sadly, I write it from a long distance from any other readers. Does Slow Language, like Slow Foods, need to embrace the local and the locally produced?

what do you mean by "reactionary"?

books on language in visual art have tended to concentrate on the work of
conceptual artists. such as kosuth.

visual poetry has not been prominent in visual art, certainly. partly
because visual art is a gallery-oriented thing. and more involved in
commerce than poetry tends to be.

also, visual poetry very often is not sophisticated as image, ie, it's not
up to snuff as image. but even when it is, it's usually not very involved in
gallerys and commerce and so on.

what do you mean by "language"?

i think that what we think of as language is changing.

just fer instance, in the theory of computation, a language can be simply a
set of strings. and the theory of computation can be viewed as the study of
the formal properties of sets of strings, of languages. clearly this notion
of language is a bit different from what a poet might typically think of as
language.

but, also, we see how the realm of the visual can in some cases be mapped to
languages. we 'parse' the visual field. we give space a kind of syntax and
grammar. pattern recognition is language recognition because patterns are
expressed in computing environments as strings or sets of strings or rules
for generating sets of strings.

all of which is just to suggest that part of the whole intensity of our
moment as poets involves a deep broadening and reexamination of what we
think of as language and where and how language operates. and of course this
touches arts and science.

concerning poetry, for me, it's the intensity of the engagement with
language that counts. not whether it's in a particular form of language.

Hi Jim,

"also, visual poetry very often is not sophisticated as image, ie, it's not
up to snuff as image. but even when it is, it's usually not very involved in
gallerys and commerce and so on."

I do agree about poetry not being involved in commerce part of your comment.
But what do you mean by "not sophisticated"? Are you not equating
sophistication by the techinical prowess of computers, in that way, being
trapped by the ghost of progress? Is progress not a quality that often the
poets/artists of one age feel about themselves only to be disillusioned
later, to be debunked or attacked by a later age?

Ciao,

Murat

A great set of questions, and Jim's post is helpful in thinking about them.

I also wonder why the distinction would be reactionary.

There were a lot of visual artists/media artists in the poetics seminars led
by Charles Bernstein at UB in the 1990s.

Jim is wrong about poets in galleries--hundreds of visual poets have had
their work in flagship museums/galleries, and too many to list here, but the
most recent is Lawrence Wiener's 40 year retrospective at the Whitney
Museum.

Dick Higgins' term intermedia (and his book on that subject) is the most
useful, I think, to understanding the relationships of/ between and in the
arts.

People should reject the distinction & develop as much as possible as
cultural, creative, performing, practicing artists and writers.

The distinction is classical, categorical (Aristotelian) and relates to
social identities more than any practice.  From the sociological viewpoint,
we can understand the economic meaning and use of the distinction, the
specific "places" constructed for the making, distributing, consumption of
the work.  This is found in concrete form in the academic disciplines, and
among organizations, associations, foundations, etc.  i.e.:  museum vs.
library.  Lessing's book Laocoon.

Conceptual artists, digital artists, conceptual writers, digital
literature--etc.  the viewpoint from aesthetics and poetics is of a fluid
continuum of practices and works.

Our computer screens, our monitors, are now a place of text bound by a
heretofore visually-oriented "frame" (a TV)--though digital writing can be
projected on, or through, just about any medium now.

Also the distinction of the limitation of language v. universality of
image--thus the 1960s-onward excitement over the idea of visual poetry
bringing, immediately, poetic forms into international exchange beyond the
limits of any local language.

see the poem, talk the art.

Now someone should tell us all about the distinction between thinking and
art.  Are art and thinking different?

Although verbal and visual languages are different, they are both
"languages."  I've been reading W.J.T. Mitchell, who conceptualizes many of
these issues in historic and conceptual detail.  The classic perspective
traditionally perceives the "visual" as *not* "language," as *not* artifice
but "natural," or "immediate" to the eye -- therefore, something very unlike
poetry.  That perspective, historically (for example, Gombrich) has given
way to a recognition that such "immediacy" in the visual image is a myth,
and that visual images are as manipulated and textual as are verbal/poetic
ones.

Thanks Jim,
'reactionary' wasn't a word my friend used, but I assume he meant that there was a time when a distinction between visual art / poetry made sense, or at least was accepted, but that now it is anachronistic.

I guess it does come down to what is meant with language and I do understand that images could be arranged in a formally 'linguistic' systematicity. It seems weird though that a visual artist or poet could present their work as either art or poetry. Not that I insist on the distinction, on the contrary. But I do have my doubts about calling syntactically/grammatically mapped images poetry. Isn't there a systematicity inherent in everything? Maybe it's the communal element I'm missing, that language is an agreed upon convention, used by a group of people..

"...part of the whole intensity of our moment as poets involves a deep broadening and reexamination of what we think of as language": I think this maybe is an accurate description of our present situation; that we're in a transitional moment with respect to language, leaving an unclear distinction between visual art / poetry.

J.

what do you mean by "reactionary"?

books on language in visual art have tended to concentrate on the work of conceptual artists. such as kosuth.

visual poetry has not been prominent in visual art, certainly. partly because visual art is a gallery-oriented thing. and more involved in commerce than poetry tends to be.

also, visual poetry very often is not sophisticated as image, ie, it's not up to snuff as image. but even when it is, it's usually not very involved in gallerys and commerce and so on.

what do you mean by "language"?

i think that what we think of as language is changing.

just fer instance, in the theory of computation, a language can be simply a set of strings. and the theory of computation can be viewed as the study of the formal properties of sets of strings, of languages. clearly this notion of language is a bit different from what a poet might typically think of as language.

but, also, we see how the realm of the visual can in some cases be mapped to languages. we 'parse' the visual field. we give space a kind of syntax and grammar. pattern recognition is language recognition because patterns are expressed in computing environments as strings or sets of strings or rules for generating sets of strings.

all of which is just to suggest that part of the whole intensity of our moment as poets involves a deep broadening and reexamination of what we think of as language and where and how language operates. and of course this touches arts and science.

concerning poetry, for me, it's the intensity of the engagement with language that counts. not whether it's in a particular form of language.

One good thing abt the museums and landmarks approach is it helps generate
money for the local community via tourism
The money could be used for as Catherine suggest library places to teach or
make zine posters anything-
(there might be pressure to just crank out more little replicas of the house
and the figure(s) of the writer/s who lived in the house-
the "Fauxk Art" approach i call it-
local citizens become elves in a little Bronte workshop and one day rebel!
and burn the place down and then no more tourists--

seriously, there have been efforts in recent years to restore the houses Poe
lived in in NYC--
my mother years ago sent a long long New Yorker article by a man who was in
search of the house where Walt Whitman lived when he wrote and produced the
First Edition of leaves of Grass.  A very long search!  Finally the writer
climbs many flights of stairs and knocks on the door of the place where
Whitman would've lived--and a giant Rastafarian answers the door.

The writers says--did you know that the great poet Walt Whitman lived here
when he wrote Leaves of Grass, the first version?

the gentleman at the door replied--ho do you know a great poet isn't living
here NOW.

Recently, by accident, someone fired an actual shot during those mass
recreations of the Battel of gettyburg in whcih people i exact historical
uniforms and with gun replicas and swords and cannon fight out the "reply"
of the 150 year old batte.

I am surprised more people
do not start taking advantge of these battles to do some battling of their
own--


i wonder if someday to keep the costs of maintenance down, these scenes
might not be presented as are those of the caves where the cave paintings
are--
the caves one may no longer visit as part of their "protection" are
replicated in every way, and that way the tourist, the interested, the
curious--may "*re--experience* in a literal way via the *re-creation* of the
original house where once upon a time the great so and so wrote in one
corner and used the chamber pot in another-

to experience via a replica--is a very interesting concept in itself--
does one experience the same sensory and spiritual aura & drama of the
original site?
or does one come away with a replica of what might have been one's
experience in the face or inside the original?
so that one's "experience" becomes removed from the site, distanced by
replication--
and is another way in which the world is "evacuated" by the simulacrum, the
replicants, reproductions, simulations--

one's feelings of a place are no longer of place but of an abstracted,
distanced "idea" or "concept" of the "installation"--
the materials one is experiencing are not the same as the originals, perhaps
made out of an entirely different kind of material, though looking all the
same "very life-like"--

so now the living may visit a place where no one lived but is a life-like
replica of a place where formerly people actually lived--

if "no one" other than an idea of a being, lives inside the replica--then is
one encountering--no one? or a replkicant of the "writers spirit which one
may still feel haunting these old walls."

so--a "spirit" of the writer--becomes a replicant of the spirit of the
writer existing in a replicated home of the writer--

surrounded by so much replication, does human remain strictly human, or does
it not perhaps begin to take on "the feelings and emotions of an imagination
or idea of a replicant's feelings and ideas"--
and so eventually the person who enter the replicated house and meet the
replicants of the spirits of the dead writer--inhabiting and haunting these
replicated spaces--what then?--eventually the person becomes awarre of the
touch of the replicated as being more real than the untouched original-to
themselves and their freinds and al the rest who come there--

and by feeling only replications, replicants eventual the human might dream,
desire to be also a replicant of oneself's' dead being, or of one's living
one--to "live on" as a replication of one 's spirit in a physical way
impossible before--

then death would become more important than life because in death one can
replicate life without the consequences as one remains only inside the
replication of ones "safe" abode--

there would be then the necessitating of making a replicated body as well a
replicated spirit--
one doesn't even have to die to "have one's replicant and spirit walk beside
one"--
(perhaps related to --or a replicant of --"the Third Who Walks beside
me"--as in Eliot or Burroughs-Gysin's The third mind--??-[-they had in mind
the quote from Eliot])

i wi leave off there, but it is a variant on-what exactly are people seeking
to view an original house where once the lady's slippers trod?

are one's dreams one's life one's imagination altered by the contact with
the spirit 'sitl infusing these pieces of furniture, these curtains, the
very fireplace, with the spirit of the writer--"

so that one walks out with a part of the "dead' one's being accompanying
one--

and would this really be radically different once one was going to
replicated caves and houses---

to touch greatness is this a way to Thank the writer and also hope that God
willing some of the Greatness might rub off on oneself, or inhabit oneself
as it is "drunk in," as one is "immersed in its spirit waves"--

i think the strangest "home of a writer" i have seen/been  was that of
Nostradamus (this was before much had been made of it being such--i imagine
now a tourist trap of the Nostradamus-predictad MegaMagnitude!)-)--in
Saint-Remy, where Van Gogh much later on committed suicide in the asylum
just outside the little town--

this place was  so tiny and almost unnoticeable in a street without sunshine
straight out of literally-- to be sure!-- the "Dark Ages"-- as t was so
anonymously like every other tiny low ceilinged stone house among the row of
them lined exactly next each other--

the streets looked more like it belonged in the nearby town of Uzes--
which is to say--
like a much darker copy of the film Las Hurdas (Land without bread) by Luis
Bunuel (a mockumentary)

it's nothing about computers, murat. a lot of visual poetry--of course there
are wonderful exceptions--is not interesting as image. it is often
interesting as text/image hybrid and possibly as language and/or poem in a
mainly literary vein, or as proto-information/text step one poetics creator
or as schematic language machine blueprint or musical 'score' or any number
of other things that are strong enough functionally/conceptually that, in a
real sense, it doesn't matter that, as image, they are naive or poorly
executed or just not interested in the piece simply as image. usually visual
poetry isn't by people whose main thing is visual art or who, otherwise,
have managed to pick up a sense of image that makes inroads both literarily,
in a broad sense, and in visual art.

but, similarly, if you look at visual art, how often is it interesting
concerning language even when it uses written language? it might be
interesting as image or installation or event or in any number of other
typically visual-art-oriented parameters.

moreover, some scepticism regarding the efficacy of attention to the visual
art oriented quality of image is warranted. often what's of interest is of
interest as image for silly reasons. popular culture is a forty five year
old determinedly juvenile. visual poetry is not often popular, it doesn't
have to do the popular thing, and that also is valuable.

also, a certain scepticism regarding the value of gallerys is useful. i
remember hearing a big canadian curator say 'an artist without a gallery is
nothing'. which is unbelievably arrogant. you know, in net art, early on,
there was talk about the value of artists doing net art to be free from the
gallerys. but of course much of that was punk-minded propaganda to attract
the attention of a gallery.

so i don't intend the remark simply as a criticism of visual poetry or
visual poets.

the practice is fluid, as douglas suggests. but my observation is that there
still are lots of divides between visual art and visual poetry.

Interesting thread.

It's funny. I am in the midst of proposing a show to a gallery. The name of
the show is "I HATE POETRY READINGS"... Basically, it's an anthology bound
on walls that promotes a public reading of work that resists , on some
level, vocalization.  I've always enjoyed art receptions and believe that
kind of tone, and the communication amongst the viewers,  is appropriate to
fulfilling a text's meaning. Regular readings, in my experience, are so one
way and very colonizing on the part of the reader...Further, there is also a
serious tone, a stuffiness, that seems to stifle what could be valuable
conversations regarding the work.
The work I am looking for, and the work I've so far found for it, is what I
call "post-genre" works. I somehow think it's important to stay away from
the words "poems", "poetry", "visual poetry" -- people have assumptions of
what these are, also, there are stereotypes of the "poem and poet" that I
think are negative and cheesy-- black berets, warm and humid personalities.
Case in point, I remember talking about poems to people who could care
less-- their response: "Isn't poetry what you do before suicide?"-- So
there's "poetry as symptom"...

Work being produced today fail public's templates of what a poem is--
largely because of curriculum and public education...

SO here's my thought:
1) Come up with a new label
2) do readings in appropriate settings
3) Publish and sell posters instead of books.

As much as I think/know there are many by now great pieces of 'concrete poe=

 to keep and figure out ways to keep both mediums=A0 'knocking heads' with =
each other - that is, exploring ways in which the combination of visual and=
 linguistic offer the opportunity, for example, to yoke together opposites =
and/or similarities to produce something different - maybe comic and/or bar=
oque in ways that provoke the senses and mind into unpredictable places/pie=
ces.=20

I say this now in part - if I can be self-serving here - because of a curre=
nt blog "Daily Phrase Project"=A0 for this month in which my practice has b=
een to combine a photograph and either a piece of signage or a spoken phras=
e into 'a unit.'=A0 In addition to keeping my eye and ear perked to the loc=
al ground (tho phrases sometime leap out of the international TV set), I fi=
nd both the exploration and the resulting combinations often to be revelato=
ry. As to whether or not this work may also be taken as a form of 'social s=
culpture', that thought, for whatever its worth, has crossed my mind, too. =
As well as make me rethink other viz/po considerations.=20

what do you mean by "reactionary"?

books on language in visual art have tended to concentrate on the work of c=
onceptual artists. such as kosuth.

visual poetry has not been prominent in visual art, certainly. partly becau=
se visual art is a gallery-oriented thing. and more involved in commerce th=
an poetry tends to be.

also, visual poetry very often is not sophisticated as image, ie, it's not =
up to snuff as image. but even when it is, it's usually not very involved i=
n gallerys and commerce and so on.

what do you mean by "language"?

i think that what we think of as language is changing.

just fer instance, in the theory of computation, a language can be simply a=
 set of strings. and the theory of computation can be viewed as the study o=
f the formal properties of sets of strings, of languages. clearly this noti=
on of language is a bit different from what a poet might typically think of=
 as language.

but, also, we see how the realm of the visual can in some cases be mapped t=
o languages. we 'parse' the visual field. we give space a kind of syntax an=
d grammar. pattern recognition is language recognition because patterns are=
 expressed in computing environments as strings or sets of strings or rules=
 for generating sets of strings.

all of which is just to suggest that part of the whole intensity of our mom=
ent as poets involves a deep broadening and reexamination of what we think =
of as language and where and how language operates. and of course this touc=
hes arts and science.

concerning poetry, for me, it's the intensity of the engagement with langua=
ge that counts. not whether it's in a particular form of language.

One good thing abt the museums and landmarks approach is it helps generate
money for the local community via tourism
The money could be used for as Catherine suggest library places to teach or
make zine posters anything-
(there might be pressure to just crank out more little replicas of the hous=
e
and the figure(s) of the writer/s who lived in the house-
the "Fauxk Art" approach i call it-
local citizens become elves in a little Bronte workshop and one day rebel!
and burn the place down and then no more tourists--

seriously, there have been efforts in recent years to restore the houses Po=
e
lived in in NYC--
my mother years ago sent a long long New Yorker article by a man who was in
search of the house where Walt Whitman lived when he wrote and produced the
First Edition of leaves of Grass.=A0 A very long search!=A0 Finally the wri=
ter
climbs many flights of stairs and knocks on the door of the place where
Whitman would've lived--and a giant Rastafarian answers the door.

The writers says--did you know that the great poet Walt Whitman lived here
when he wrote Leaves of Grass, the first version?

the gentleman at the door replied--ho do you know a great poet isn't living
here NOW.

Recently, by accident, someone fired an actual shot during those mass
recreations of the Battel of gettyburg in whcih people i exact historical
uniforms and with gun replicas and swords and cannon fight out the "reply"
of the 150 year old batte.

I am surprised more people
do not start taking advantge of these battles to do some battling of their
own--


i wonder if someday to keep the costs of maintenance down, these scenes
might not be presented as are those of the caves where the cave paintings
are--
the caves one may no longer visit as part of their "protection" are
replicated in every way, and that way the tourist, the interested, the
curious--may "*re--experience* in a literal way via the *re-creation* of th=
e
original house where once upon a time the great so and so wrote in one
corner and used the chamber pot in another-

to experience via a replica--is a very interesting concept in itself--
does one experience the same sensory and spiritual aura & drama of the
original site?
or does one come away with a replica of what might have been one's
experience in the face or inside the original?
so that one's "experience" becomes removed from the site, distanced by
replication--
and is another way in which the world is "evacuated" by the simulacrum, the
replicants, reproductions, simulations--

one's feelings of a place are no longer of place but of an abstracted,
distanced "idea" or "concept" of the "installation"--
the materials one is experiencing are not the same as the originals, perhap=
s
made out of an entirely different kind of material, though looking all the
same "very life-like"--

so now the living may visit a place where no one lived but is a life-like
replica of a place where formerly people actually lived--

if "no one" other than an idea of a being, lives inside the replica--then i=
s
one encountering--no one? or a replkicant of the "writers spirit which one
may still feel haunting these old walls."

so--a "spirit" of the writer--becomes a replicant of the spirit of the
writer existing in a replicated home of the writer--

surrounded by so much replication, does human remain strictly human, or doe=
s
it not perhaps begin to take on "the feelings and emotions of an imaginatio=
n
or idea of a replicant's feelings and ideas"--
and so eventually the person who enter the replicated house and meet the
replicants of the spirits of the dead writer--inhabiting and haunting these
replicated spaces--what then?--eventually the person becomes awarre of the
touch of the replicated as being more real than the untouched original-to
themselves and their freinds and al the rest who come there--

and by feeling only replications, replicants eventual the human might dream=
,
desire to be also a replicant of oneself's' dead being, or of one's living
one--to "live on" as a replication of one 's spirit in a physical way
impossible before--

then death would become more important than life because in death one can
replicate life without the consequences as one remains only inside the
replication of ones "safe" abode--

there would be then the necessitating of making a replicated body as well a
replicated spirit--
one doesn't even have to die to "have one's replicant and spirit walk besid=
e
one"--
(perhaps related to --or a replicant of --"the Third Who Walks beside
me"--as in Eliot or Burroughs-Gysin's The third mind--??-[-they had in mind
the quote from Eliot])

i wi leave off there, but it is a variant on-what exactly are people seekin=
g
to view an original house where once the lady's slippers trod?

are one's dreams one's life one's imagination altered by the contact with
the spirit 'sitl infusing these pieces of furniture, these curtains, the
very fireplace, with the spirit of the writer--"

so that one walks out with a part of the "dead' one's being accompanying
one--

and would this really be radically different once one was going to
replicated caves and houses---

to touch greatness is this a way to Thank the writer and also hope that God
willing some of the Greatness might rub off on oneself, or inhabit oneself
as it is "drunk in," as one is "immersed in its spirit waves"--

i think the strangest "home of a writer" i have seen/been=A0 was that of
Nostradamus (this was before much had been made of it being such--i imagine
now a tourist trap of the Nostradamus-predictad MegaMagnitude!)-)--in
Saint-Remy, where Van Gogh much later on committed suicide in the asylum

it may be that the gulf between the realms of visual art and visual poetry
is, partly, a result of visual poetry doing something not simply worse but
basically different from visual art. and that 'something' may relate to the
above.  the engagement of visual poetry with issues of language can be
totally diverse and intense. difficult. idiosyncratic. personal. universal.
but engaged with matters from computing to orality, poetry to code, visual
art to publishing.

'the image' is not the main thing in visual poetry. this is often not
understood by visual artists and visual poetry appears as the domain of
writers who are simply incompetent and mainly unimaginative concerning
everything visual. of course there is lots of that, but the main thing is
that the image is not the main thing, in visual poetry, as it is in visual
art. instead, it's the nature and intensity of the engagement with language.

This volume is the first of its kind to collect classic and contemporary
work focused on the intersection of poetry and cultural studies,
reaching from Wordsworth's "Preface to Lyrical Ballads" and W. E. B. Du
Bois's "Of the Sorrow Songs" to present-day essays on rap lyrics, queer

roles in popular or mass culture, these essays effectively delineate the
relationship between poetry and the public social culture in which it is
engendered.

Hi, all!

Our theater group, the Nonsense Company, will premiere our big new theater =
piece, STORM STILL, at the Minnesota Fringe Festival, starting this weekend=
. If anyone's interested in socially critical metatextuality (gosh, who isn=
't?), avant-garde music, historical oddities, experimental writing, humor a=
nd pathos, very well-rehearsed acting, and a bit of targeted nastiness, ple=
ase do come! It will be strange, fun, and probably a bit distressing.=20

(The attentive may also catch fragments of Foucault, Spicer, Crane, and oth=
ers).=20

I've pasted our mass email blurb below. Hope you're all doing well!

Jim, you write,"it's the intensity of the engagement with language that cou=
nts. Not whether it's in a particular form of language." This hits it dead =
on. The intensity of the engagement becomes=A0particularly=A0transparent in=
 the visual form, especially when the act of (spontaneous) making is eviden=
t in the visual poem. When the action of the brush is undeniable, its splat=
ter, intention and even its accident, the energy speaks, and language forme=
d out of the shape. At least this is one of the many ways it's possible. Th=
is is a bit different for digital visual poetry, since the body is not as d=
irectly evident. I'm curious what you think about this notion.
For me, visual poetry is visceral. It acts upon the body more immediately t=
han language alone. The image is registered by the brain before language, o=
r as 'open language', as it impacts the senses. Size and color, whether som=
ething is can be touched or manipulated are other factors. Visual poetry ge=
ts people to "walk through" poems, it can invite and engage even the most r=
eluctant and distracted viewer/participant.=A0

what do you mean by "reactionary"?

books on language in visual art have tended to concentrate on the work of c=
onceptual artists. such as kosuth.

visual poetry has not been prominent in visual art, certainly. partly becau=
se visual art is a gallery-oriented thing. and more involved in commerce th=
an poetry tends to be.

also, visual poetry very often is not sophisticated as image, ie, it's not =
up to snuff as image. but even when it is, it's usually not very involved i=
n gallerys and commerce and so on.

what do you mean by "language"?

i think that what we think of as language is changing.

just fer instance, in the theory of computation, a language can be simply a=
 set of strings. and the theory of computation can be viewed as the study o=
f the formal properties of sets of strings, of languages. clearly this noti=
on of language is a bit different from what a poet might typically think of=
 as language.

but, also, we see how the realm of the visual can in some cases be mapped t=
o languages. we 'parse' the visual field. we give space a kind of syntax an=
d grammar. pattern recognition is language recognition because patterns are=
 expressed in computing environments as strings or sets of strings or rules=
 for generating sets of strings.

all of which is just to suggest that part of the whole intensity of our mom=
ent as poets involves a deep broadening and reexamination of what we think =
of as language and where and how language operates. and of course this touc=
hes arts and science.

concerning poetry, for me, it's the intensity of the engagement with langua=
ge that counts. not whether it's in a particular form of language.

Hello,You know how sometimes it's possible to just give someone the perfect
gift?  Well, I put a lot of thought into gifts for the people who are
important in my life, and my best friend is getting married in Boston on
Sunday, and if I could give him a copy of Zukofsky's 'A' - but it's out of
print!  See, he's a medieval scholar, but he loves modernist literature,
though doesn't study it enough to know about 'A' yet, and I am really,
really hoping...anyways, if someone has a copy they'd be willing to sell -
for less than the cheapest copy on Amazon, which is $80 and I'm sure
wouldn't come in time, and can meet me in Boston/Cambridge on
Saturday/Sunday or have it delivered to the friend there who I'll be staying
with - please backchannel!
Best,

I think that one of the advantages (among a few admitted disadvantages) of
living in the age of postmodernity is that we no longer need to feel bound
to any limiting grand narratives.

There is room for poetry that rhymes. There is room for poetry that is
pleasing to the ear. There is room for poetry that is classically composed.
There is room for short-forms, long-forms, old forms, sonnets, villanelles,
haiku, senryu, tanka, and zen. And there is also room for visual poetry,
language poetry, concrete poetry, and for fluxus/intermedia works that
cannot even be easily classed as poetry.

Write, read, make, and create whatever it is that pleases you --- and as
long as the global village continues to communicate via bits and bytes, you
are bound to find an audience and some fellow travelers on whatever road you
happen to travel on.

Interesting thread.

It's funny. I am in the midst of proposing a show to a gallery. The name of
the show is "I HATE POETRY READINGS"... Basically, it's an anthology bound
on walls that promotes a public reading of work that resists , on some
level, vocalization.  I've always enjoyed art receptions and believe that
kind of tone, and the communication amongst the viewers,  is appropriate to
fulfilling a text's meaning. Regular readings, in my experience, are so one
way and very colonizing on the part of the reader...Further, there is also a
serious tone, a stuffiness, that seems to stifle what could be valuable
conversations regarding the work.
The work I am looking for, and the work I've so far found for it, is what I
call "post-genre" works. I somehow think it's important to stay away from
the words "poems", "poetry", "visual poetry" -- people have assumptions of
what these are, also, there are stereotypes of the "poem and poet" that I
think are negative and cheesy-- black berets, warm and humid personalities.
Case in point, I remember talking about poems to people who could care
less-- their response: "Isn't poetry what you do before suicide?"-- So
there's "poetry as symptom"...

Work being produced today fail public's templates of what a poem is--
largely because of curriculum and public education...

SO here's my thought:
1) Come up with a new label
2) do readings in appropriate settings
3) Publish and sell posters instead of books.

RE:
"...but my observation is that there still are lots of divides between
visual art and visual poetry.

ja"


The idea of "divides" strikes me as outdated. I suppose that if one
considers oneself to be something as limiting as a "painter", or a "poet" or
a "novelist" or whatever sub-sub-genre of artist, then the idea of divisions
might be attractive as a way to set oneself apart as an expert, or as a
member of an exclusive elite.

For me these divisions are arbitrary and mostly meaningless. I don't see why
an artist needs to limit himself to any one medium, or even genre. I have
been involved with Fluxus and Intermedia for a number of years. I think that
the most interesting and meaningful work being created today is happening in
the spaces in which media intersect. Visual poetry sits in the intersection
of visual art and text-based language. It also exists within a continuum of
expression that includes everything from typewriter based concrete poetry
through asemic writing and glyphs to digitally created or intermediated
work.

I think that Merce Cunningham and his partner John Cage exemplified the idea
of Intermedia perfectly in their collaborations and in their independent
works.

it's nothing about computers, murat. a lot of visual poetry--of course there

are wonderful exceptions--is not interesting as image. it is often
interesting as text/image hybrid and possibly as language and/or poem in a
mainly literary vein, or as proto-information/text step one poetics creator
or as schematic language machine blueprint or musical 'score' or any number
of other things that are strong enough functionally/conceptually that, in a
real sense, it doesn't matter that, as image, they are naive or poorly
executed or just not interested in the piece simply as image. usually visual

poetry isn't by people whose main thing is visual art or who, otherwise,
have managed to pick up a sense of image that makes inroads both literarily,

in a broad sense, and in visual art.

but, similarly, if you look at visual art, how often is it interesting
concerning language even when it uses written language? it might be
interesting as image or installation or event or in any number of other
typically visual-art-oriented parameters.

moreover, some scepticism regarding the efficacy of attention to the visual
art oriented quality of image is warranted. often what's of interest is of
interest as image for silly reasons. popular culture is a forty five year
old determinedly juvenile. visual poetry is not often popular, it doesn't
have to do the popular thing, and that also is valuable.

also, a certain scepticism regarding the value of gallerys is useful. i
remember hearing a big canadian curator say 'an artist without a gallery is
nothing'. which is unbelievably arrogant. you know, in net art, early on,
there was talk about the value of artists doing net art to be free from the
gallerys. but of course much of that was punk-minded propaganda to attract
the attention of a gallery.

so i don't intend the remark simply as a criticism of visual poetry or

It might make more sense to say that there are many artistic practices that are concerned with the interaction of language and visuality, including web design, graphic design, painting, conceptual art, sculpture, calligraphy (especially non-alphabetic), comix, graffiti/taggers and visual/concrete poetry.  It's not that one practice is more or less reactionary than another, it's that each of these groups function as different communities with their own values, vocabularies, audiences and institutions.  What's cutting edge to one group is ordinary practice to another and irrelevant to a third.  More often than not the groups don't intersect, but there are lots of examples of people crossing over from one of these groups into another, like Ian Hamilton Finlay going from concrete poetry to sculpture/installation.

4th floor, room 447

August 5th, 2009, 7pm-8:30pm

Over the course of the Summer semester, seven NYU students have =20
composed, mangled, generated and remixed text with their new =20
programming language of choice: Python. Student projects under =20
development include programs to generate Fibonacci creation myths, =20
stochastic Walt Whitman madlibs, e.e. cummings/Twitter mashups, and =20
new poetic forms based on Gone With The Wind.

After an intense semester, these students gather for one night only to =20=

perform their textual creations. All are welcome to this evening of =20
experimental performances of digital writing!

Digital Writing with Python is a course offered at NYU=92s Interactive =20=

Telecommunication Program. (http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/). The course is an =20=

introduction to both the Python programming language and contemporary =20=

techniques in electronic literature. Students use Python to acquire =20
and analyze digital text, while devising new techniques for composing =20=

texts by algorithmic means. The goal of the course is to experiment =20
with language and literature while exploring the aesthetic, technical =20=

and expressive possibilities of computer-generated (and -mangled) text.

One of the problems with this discussion is that there are many kinds of
visual poetry; it is not some "pan-visual-=poetryism"--which can be
dismissed as unsophisticated visually as Jim does.
In the US--written poetry has been most of  the base on which the visual
poem is built--it is at the forefront of the examination of what a visual
poem is qua poetry, and so the visual is relegated to a "lesser" realm. It
is "language" which is fore fronted, though not in the more strict and
linguistics/semantics orientations of much of earlier  Concrete Poetry, Many
aspects of Concrete Poetry at one point had much in common with early
structuralism, and so their extensions in theory developed along linguistic
lines, until, as Philadelpho Menezes  points to and demonstrates
historically in Poetics and Visuality a Trajectory of Contemporary Brazilian
Poetry, the visual elements gain in importance as elements themselves, and
these in turn develop into the demand for the deeper inquiry into the
elements of sound, moving towards a "toaltity' of a work which is more akin
to the cinema.

I think a lot of the "devaluation of the visual" is partly responsible for
the "less sophisticated, less visual, less intersting" aspects of visual
poetry.  In a sense, alotof visual poetry has nothing to do with visuality,
looking, seeing, movements of the eyes in examining attentively the field
and peripheries of the visual as a notation of sonic transmissions from out
the cracks as it were of the walls--the sounds of colors, colors of sounds,
--al of this is eschewed in much Visual Poetry of the kind Jim is writing
about in favor of what is a process not of looking, but of reading.

I think the uses of the virtual, of images which are there only via
electricity--begins to decay the visual as a seeing, looking, with materials
that exist physically, and whose movements in time and through spaces are
effected by an immense number of continauly shifting phenomena--the weather
being one of them.  In the virtual real, the eye does not need to be as
developing in looking "into" time and space, because there is less affecting
the image,  This virtual image becomes as it were "still" in a kind of
"suspended eternity" in which neither  the corrosions of time nor the
effects created by  the movements of objects in space that interact with the
materials of the ever changing image exist.

One of the striking aspects of many types of Visual Poetry is the lack of
interest in the visual which the poetry displays.  Instead, the fascination
is strictly of a textual nature, in that the  poetry is anchored by its
dependence on letters, words, phrases, as supports for the construction of a
form of cross word puzzle/scrabble effect and in a playing with the sizes
and fonts of letters i relation to these "impositions of the grid" onto not
what is seen, but what is placed there within a grid, the grid being the
guide to seeing/reading..



In this realm of discussion, between the uses of text and of the virtual,
what is vacated is the visual.  That is the actual "art of looking" of which
Robert Smithson wrote.  Smithson writes that a great artist may create a
work simply by casting a glance.  This creates an art which exists in the
act of looking's looking--there is no "object" produced, there is no
"concept" expressed, there is no "trace" of this other than what exists for
Smithson as a reality which is as durable as any sculpture, written poem,
machine, etc

Visual Poetry ironically then in the US seems to be far less about visuality
and not even so much re poetry in this sense, as about a form of
"solidifying" a text within a "stopped time" whose movements are done as
"readings" rather than as the art of looking. :

in a visual poem all the elements are treated as equals in terms of their
opening to possiblities--, -that is to say--a color, a line, a dot, a form ,
the texture of the surfaces, the "indelible imprint of the material
world"--al of these are elements of language just as are morphemes, letter,
syllables, words, phrase--
in the arrangements of a visual poem al of these elements are
"calling"--speaking--singing-sounding--color itself is a language--and
languages do not have to be written or formalized--a language may be found
expressive in sounding a side walk crack, a shadow, the passage of
footprints through a field, or in snow--these provide a basis, as well as
those things found al around one which are the evidences of time passing in
the effects which are wreaked on materials considered durable--

if one examines peeling, fading, cracking painted walls or the cracked
paints on boards oand doors, the movement of lichen and moss in obscuring
the letters on a plaque, the cracking open of metal letters through decades
of extremes of heat, cold, being blasted, being bombed, being burned, al of
these continually present languages of  forms and letterings, numbers, in
the process of a negentropy of out of  chaos emerging forms and these forms
wearing down, being time affected, and then these themselves are
regenerations of forms out of the new chaos--

a teeming swarming wold exists all around one and for the most part hidden
in plain site/sight/cite from the no longer visual eyes of the virtual =
written poetry--

if one is to work with visual poetry--then
 the visual art of looking needs to be worked at, with, for--as does the
soundings which are elicited by colors,forms, fragments or phrases--

a great deal of what is called "visual poetry " by more language influenced
workers is just a carrying on of the "pattern poetry" which dick Higgins
made a book of. as far as visuality is concerned one might say, nice but
weak-=eh--very weak!

it is a rebranding of things long done, as though they have suddenly become
"new and radical" because the names have been changed--

visual poetry at least for myself works with things which exits as actual
found  materials, found letterings, fragments forms--to be involved with the
swarming teeming multiplicities which exists "before our very eyes"--
this kind of seeing requires a look /looking of far greater speed and
attention than does what one finds in the virtual and digital--where the
"framed" and stilled image is demanding instaed a "reading" within a
confiement to the aream of textuality--qua "text"--

the function of the virtual is not to be participant in time--which poetry
is after all, an art of time--but to delete time--to erase--to make
disappear things that were by the touch of the button, by the changing of a
name on line--and --peoples events names forms vanish --forever-deleted--

in another way, the virtual offers persons an example of "the new" and a
glimpse of a simulated "eternity" in the virtual not being exposed ot the
effects of time--

as long as one has sufficient  protection the "textual visual poem" remains

until one pulls the plug--or bombs the infrastructure, cuts off electricity
due to non payment or as a siege weapon as with Gaza and in Rwanda--then ,
while the electricity is off and al communications have gone "dead"--then
peoples events cultures disappear, are deleted--and when the virtual comes
on again--the electricity--there are now completely new names for the places
which had become for a while black holes in the fabric of controlled
existence which is hthat of the virtual and digital online-

in that sense in which things today are accepted unquestioningly  like
received ideas no one thinks about--"natural" ideas, facts--"known to
all"--there develops what is truly reactionary--the end of questioning and
the entrance into non stop existence of what has long been  spurned in
readers of fiction: the willing suspension of disbelief-

and in the case of Visual Poetry what is abandoned, or has yet to be there
in a real sense in termsof an art of looking--is viusality--

working with the found--one is having the experience of what Celan points
towards in writing " Poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."

exposing-exposure (to the elements, of a film negative)--the

Jim,

When I say the "visual" in poetry I mean a poetry where the eye is very
important, not as an image; but the way it moves in the experience of the
poem, as in a film or photograph, organizing what it sees into thought. In
other words, the visual is a movement of weaving.

I do not think "visual poetry," the way it is defined today does anything of
the sort. It seems to me it often is an exploration of new technological
techniques provided to it. In that sense, it lacks resistance or it has
resistance of a technical rather than intellectual kind. That is why I was
objecting to your expression "not interesting as image." It implied, to me,
the desire for a complexity impelled by technical openings, prowess, without
anything else generating it. Of course, I may be wrong or misunderstand you.

The same argument occurred a few months ago when I asked why the special
effects in the film *Blade Runner*, the last film where *no* digital effects
were used, were much more poweful and resonant than many science fiction
films which followed it. My guess was that, because to create special
effects in *Blade Runner* was so hard and laborious, the creators only used
what effects were necessary, in other words, which came from the vision of
the film and were integral to it. Otherwise, as most cases afterwards,
special effects are cliches.

Ciao,

Murat

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

FYI -If you have an interest -as I know some of us - in photography, I have begun writing reviews for two magazines, the revived B/W (Black and White photography), and Color - both from the same publisher. Both have same, adventurous as possible editor, John Lavine. I have recently written on Larry Sultan, Leo Rubinfien, Linda Connor, and Robert Dawson, and (coming up Jim Goldberg, Michael Light) and, eventually Reneke Dykstra. Most of these folks are working one kind of interesting edge or other.

Anyway the mags are pretty well distributed in what remains of news shops in America.
