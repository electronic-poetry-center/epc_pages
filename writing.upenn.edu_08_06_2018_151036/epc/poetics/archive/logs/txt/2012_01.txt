Performance at EYEBEAM, Thursday - Saturday

Performance at EYEBEAM, Project Space, Thursday 5th - Saturday 7th
If you're in the vicinity, drop in at Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street,
anytime between 1 and 6, where Eyebeam resident Alan Sondheim will
be performing with Foofwa d'Imobilite, and guest performers Azure
Carter, Mark Skwarek, and Chris Diasparra. The work ranges over a
wide variety of technologies and concerns, ranging from endurance,
weight, labor, and Second Life, to dance, choreography, acoustic
performance, and mixed reality. This is an informal presentation,
not a formal performance. It's free. We hope to see you there.
(W. 21st Street near 11th Avenue)

Thanks Regina.  That red comes like a splash of robust wine in a glass.
Tell us more.  Why no words?  Are words lame / awkward compared to the
elegant / emotional syntax of music?

My favorite monostich is Sappho's, to Eros:

] you burn me [

In English, three short words; in Greek, just two.

In two words Sappho says it all about Eros....

Awesome!

Debrah's grandfather was visited in 1966 on the coast of New Jersey by
the much-studied extraterrestrial Tiny.  She talks about how her
grandfather's experience has worked through her dreams, and how she
reenacts the dreams to encounter the poems.  She also discusses in
part two channeling the goddess Sophia, assigning songs by Madonna to
the chakras, Projection machine, The Ida Pingala and more.

Go to this link:  http://ParanormalPoetics.blogspot.com

Debrah Morkun's latest book THE IDA PINGALA is the number one best
seller at Giovanni's Room Bookstore.  The first time in the store's 35
year history that a book of poetry has become the number one best
seller!

Please enjoy,

Subject:      Emergency INDEX: got 2011 performance documentation?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Ugly Duckling Presse would like to introduce you to Emergency INDEX, an annual print publication documenting new performance in the words of its creators. Because performance transcends disciplinary boundaries, INDEX includes performances of every kind, from any genre, made anywhere in the world for any purpose.
	
Each document printed in INDEX will include a written description focused on the problems driving the work and the tactics used to address them, an image of the performance, and information about its dates, locations, and creators. An index of terms shared by the varied contributors will serve to connect geographically or stylistically far-flung works.

We are currently seeking documentation of performances created in 2011 to be published in the inaugural volume of INDEX in Spring 2012. We especially welcome political, commercial, scientific, therapeutic, or other works not typically documented as performance.

SUBMISSIONS MUST BE RECEIVED BY JANUARY 10TH AT 5PM EASTERN STANDARD TIME.

the=20
upcoming symposium:

Poetry Off The Page
at the University of Arizona Poetry Center in Tucson
May 18 2012 - May 20 2012

More visceral than conceptual, this year=92s symposium will gather poets =
for=20
whom the stage and all of its demands, such as voice, projection, sound=20=

effects, lighting, body movement, acting, props, and image, all help crea=
te a=20
new syntactic breadth for the poetic *voice.* These writers press into ne=
w=20
territories in theater, song, film/video, dance, recitation, digital arts=
,=20
sculpture, book arts and more.  Many will be performing, in many cases,=20=

original never-seen-before work for the Poetry Center.

Performances, Classes, Panels, and Exhibits by:

Julie Carr & K.J. Holmes
Brent Cunningham
Johanna Drucker
Christine Hume
Douglas Kearney
Ander Monson
Julie Patton
Claudia Rankine & John Lucas
Cecilia Vicu=F1a
Dan Waber

The Black Took Collective=20

And a screening featuring work by:

Kate Greenstreet
Deborah Poe
Sawako Nakayasu
Branding Downing
John Gallaher

Here are some descriptions of the many events that will take place over t=
he=20
four days:

Black Took Collective: Betraying Blackness
A multi-media performance exploring the Black Took Collective=92s=20
interrogations of a black unconscious. Using written and aural language,=20=

sound, video, and images, the members of the collective enact poetries of=
=20
inquiry that engage (and challenge) the psyche's making of racial=20
consciousness by conceptualizing unconsciousness. In so doing, the member=
s=20
of BTC will expose their poetic processes and poetries-in-the-making, mov=
ing=20
through poetries predicated on the conditions of blackness into meditatio=
ns on=20
the multiple factors that inspire our imaginations.

Christine Hume: Speech Talks Back
An audio show that plays the revoicings, manipulations, arrangements, and=
=20
displacements of recorded nonpoetic, nonliterary speech, in a performance=
 of=20
audio documentary poetics that refigures poetry's classic oral qualities.=
 As the=20
pieces play, Christine Hume will offer a voiceover of playful theoretical=
 riffs=20
and expanded contexts for understanding.

Christine Hume: Listening Stations
Audience members will be invited to lie their heads on pillows imbedded w=
ith=20
speakers playing original sonic versions of the work from Christine Hume'=
s=20

Cecilia Vicu=F1a presents her improvisatory oral performance in response =
to=20
place and time and a walk and conversation with the artist through her si=
te=20
specific installation, specially created for the UA Poetry Center.

Dan Waber: OFF THE PAGENESS workshop
A macro and a micro view of contemporary poetic production:
Macro: Pecha Kucha Tucson (60 different ways of making poetry off the pag=
e=20
today). A way to focus wide-ranging enthusiasms for unusual contemporary=20=

poetic practices.=20
Micro: A look at the very fat line between the visual and the textual, in=
 31=20
examples. If you see the difference between

no=20
fair princess

and

no fair
princess

you understand that text has a signifying visual component. A poem on a p=
age=20
in a book is possibly purely textual. A painting of a figure is possibly =
purely=20
visual. And between these two extremes lives a very wide expanse of=20
exploration which blends the two. The examples we'll see and discuss were=
=20
selected specifically for how difficult they are to pigeon-hole as either=
 textual=20
or visual.

Brent Cunningham: Poets Theater at The Rogue Theatre
Brent Cunningham will present three short plays: The Event, Time's=20
Machinery, and The Gunfight. These works tend to create strict limits and=
=20
strict tasks for themselves, in one case blacking out a key piece of dram=
atic=20
information, in another restricting itself to a common aphorism. In addit=
ion=20
each play utilizes a different formal strategy for selecting and training=
 its non-
professional actors, frequently taking them directly from the audience.=20=

Audience members, get ready for your closeup...

K.J. Holmes and Julie Carr: Dance Performance
=93This is where we are (or take arms against a sea of troubles), an exce=
rpt.=94
And:
Workshop with Julie Carr and K.J. Holmes: Embodying Poetics
Words are a map to the body's landscape. Movement writes us back to=20
language. In this class we will play with tone, horizon, scale and transi=
tion=20
through writing and movement patterns that will support and open up our=20=

senses and perceptions, finding a kinetic base for an embodied poetics.

Douglas Kearney: Talk and Reading with digital projections
Through a combination of digital projections of "performative typography"=
 and=20
live performance, Douglas Kearney will present his explorations with MESS=
.=20
Part talk and part reading, Kearney will mess with notions of poetic dist=
ortion,=20
trope-mapping, raw-chopped samples and the carnally-ecstatic soul singer'=
s=20
wail.

Ander Monson: Into the Labyrinth: Guerrilla Writing=20
Monson will guide writers in creating projects networked across multiple=20=

websites. Why do our poems have to be so self-contained? With the plethor=
a=20
of spaces that the web offers for users to post text or image or somethin=
g in=20
between (as in amazon reviews, craigslist ads, comment boards, personal=20=

websites, facebook walls, ebay listings, okcupid.com ads, etc.) why not, =
like=20
the hackers or graffiti artists we are all at heart, make work that asks =
the=20
reader to bounce from one site to another, even not neglecting the physic=
al=20
codex page that we still love deep inside. We will start projects that re=
quire--
nay, invite and compel--our readers to interact with the architecture of =
the=20
web, essentially a labyrinth. Monson will present some of his own labyrin=
thine=20
work in this direction and direct writers in writing and remaking these=20=

connections.

Claudia Rankine: The Situation series
Video essays that speak into national and international moments in=20
contemporary culture. As artists we wanted to address our visually satura=
ted=20
culture by bringing language to the images we consume. The series attempt=
s=20
to juxtaposition temporal memory alongside historical critique through th=
e=20
layering of sound and image. Each film runs close to five minutes.

Situation One is in dialogue with Zinedine Zidane.
Situation Two is in dialogue with 9/11.
Situation Three is in dialogue with Katrina.
Situation Five is in dialogue with Michelle Alexander's "The New Jim Crow=
".

Undocumented and Here is a new  Situation in process that enters the=20
continuing dialogue regarding what it means to be unauthorized and here.

Your Avatar and You Panel
Topics of discussion will include:

- how ebooks are changing or might change poetry publishing, how the=20
internet has altered the traditional publication and distribution models =
for=20
printed poetry books, what changes to print culture could mean for poets=20=

already allied with a long history of interrupting fixed ideas and identi=
ties.

- how the website presents one avatar for the self, in the way that books=
=20
present another avatar for the self. Considering how self publishing mean=
s the=20
self publishing the self's work, ideas about how we constantly publish th=
e self=20
=85and how the whole authorial persona/avatar/self is self-publishing, a =
series=20
of decisions (and accidents) in the self and how it is made public.

- what it means to be "published" today. What it means to be "well-publis=
hed",=20
how what all of us really want is to be read, how most people don't even=20=

necessarily want to be widely read, but want to be well read. ..opportuni=

published, even how to be well-published (good design imparts credibility=
), but=20
it has not solved the problem of how to be read, and well-read.=20

- The problem of distribution. How do I get my work read by the people wh=

my favourite in the greek fragment mode is by alcaeus (trans david a. campb=
ell)

'... crazy ...'

~

but i also like the more editorially tentative

' ... (as?) the nightingale ... voice ...'

and

'... (reef?). Let her ...'

tho the latter may be a quote from a longer fragment ..

i also like palindromes

Usually if you experience my work at all, you experience it on my site
http://vispo.com . Since 1996 vispo.com has been the thing I've been working
on. Vispo.com is what happens to poetry when the 'page' becomes programmable
and the borders between media and arts begin to dissolve in binary acid.
And, for the past couple of years, I've been more interested in generative
art. There's quite a range of types of work on vispo.com. I try not to
repeat myself.

However, in January I'm giving three talks. Two in Vancouver BC and one in
Seattle. If you're around, I hope you can make at least one of them. Here's
info on the talks.

FRIDAY JAN 6, 8-10:30pm, HUGO HOUSE (SEATTLE)
I'll be giving a short (10 min) talk at Hugo House in Seattle (1634 11th
Ave) at an event organized by people involved in 'electronic literature'.
I'm one of about ten people giving a short ten min presentation on a work of
e-lit. The event is from 8 to 10:30. I'm up third. The other people
presenting are Jason Nelson, John Cayley, Aaron Angello/Erin Costello, Ian
Bogost, Marjorie Luesebrink, Mark Marino, Nick Montfort, Stephanie
Strickland, Brian Kim Stefans, and Rob Wittig. There's also an exhibit of
works of 'electronic literature' associated with this event. The exhibit is
on display in the Washington Convention Center. Info at
http://eliterature.org/2011/12/e-lit-exhibit-and-performance-at-mla-2012

WEDNESDAY JAN 11, 2:30-4:30 PM, SFU SURREY (VANCOUVER)
 I'll be giving a talk/presentation at SFU Surrey on quite a bit of my work.
SFU Surrey is at 250 -13450 102 Avenue Surrey. The talk is in room 5380 (5th
floor). The talk is sponsored by the School of Interactive Arts and
Technology at SFU. Info at
http://www.sfu.ca/siatclass/IAT805/January_11,_2012.html . See
http://www.siat.sfu.ca/contact for directions on how to get to SFU Surrey.

SATURDAY JAN 14, 1-5 PM, SFU HARBOUR CENTER (VANCOUVER)
I'll be presenting my most recent work, Aleph Null, to a group of
professional JavaScript developers. This is part of an event featuring four
other speakers. See http://supervanjs.eventbrite.com to reserve a ticket,
for location info, and for info on the other speakers.

All the best of the new year to you!

Carol Novack: A Life Remembered

Carol Novack's work is populated by singular, breathtaking glimpses of the =
human condition, garnered from within a hair's breadth of the abyss.  There=
 are notions in her work of a primordial =DCbermensch, a shadowy figure hid=
den within "the collective experiment called mankind." She once said, "I ra=
ge against the dark forces within all of us, and the conformity that sicken=
s me."  Yet she approached her work and life with humor and verve.  She emb=
raced the absurd, the surreal and the mythological, rubbing them up against=
 each other with her own unique rhythm and lyricism.

Proponents of conventional narrative sometimes criticized her visionary wor=
k for its lack of cohesion, a missing red thread; yet  Carol was not an exp=
erimentalist for its own sake.  She sought to discover a voice of reason wi=
thin the hubbub of myths and neon road signs; along the way, she broke conv=
ention to re-discover, to re-emerge. In her own words: "I don't believe in =
rules. I take dictation from the flow of metaphors that surface from my unc=
onscious as I write, think of my writing self as a metaphorist."

Of her 2010 book Giraffes in Hiding: The Mythical Memoirs of Carol Novak (S=
puyten Duvyil), American Book Review observed: " Carol poses metafictional =
questions about who or what controls our narratives, and what kinds of powe=
r is or is not available through narrative...If only for an instant, the gi=
raffes go into hiding, and the minnows emerge." PANK Journal enthused: "Whi=
lst reading this unique book, I felt I was deep-sea diving, surrounded by e=
xotic and breathtaking words-as-creatures, but mindful too of the murkiness=
, sinister and danger that also lurk both under and above water."

In an interview in the Canadian literary journal Metazen, she said she had =
reached "the overwhelming realization that one must create one's own meanin=
g, the isolated self's confrontation of its own short-lived existence, the =
significance of being human and humane."

She spurned literary prizes, institutionalized creative writing programs an=
d all forms of elitism, not only in the arts, but in society in general.  I=
n her twenty-year career as an appellate and trial lawyer, she gave voice t=
o the silenced and marginalized.  "Law," she said, "is a white rabbit that =
falls into black holes."  She told Glasgow poet, Dee Sunshine in an intervi=
ew, "The battles were almost always up very steep hills, and I mistrusted a=
nd disliked the 'justice' system for various reasons."  Nonetheless, she to=
ok pride in her legal work, particularly her written motions and appellate =
briefs, and won an important federal constitutional action on behalf of vis=
ual artists (Bery v City of New York, et al.).

Born February 19, 1948, she grew up in Bell Harbor, New York, the single ch=
ild of musicologist Saul Novack, Dean of Arts and Humanities at Queens Coll=
ege, and Phyllis Novack, librarian. Of her childhood, she once said, "I gre=
w up with wonderful music permeating our house like a bouquet of luscious s=
cents."

She completed her BA at the University of Rochester in East Asian Studies, =
moved to Sydney, Australia where she worked as an editor for the Australian=
 Cosmopolitan, and began publishing her poetry during the seventies.  A cha=
pbook, Living Alone Without a Dictionary, was published by the University o=
f Queensland Press, and her work was included in The Penguin Book of Austra=
lian Women Poets.  She was the recipient of an Australian Council of the Ar=
ts writer's grant, remaining in Australia until 1977.

After a traveling in India and Europe,  Carol returned to New York City whe=
re she received her J.D. from New York Law School in 1983. As an attorney, =
she worked first in the Criminal Appeals Bureau of the New York Legal Aid S=
ociety and later as a solo practitioner, championing the causes of artists =
and the underprivileged.

She went on to receive her master's degree in social work (community organi=
zing), and teach lyrical fiction writing at The Women's Studio Center in NY=
C, returning to the serious pursuit of her own writing in 2004.  "The muse =
just suddenly reared her jerky head again," she said.

From the mid-2000s, she began publishing her gender-bending hybrid metafict=
ion- "her little aliens," as she called them-in many journals and anthologi=
es, including: American Letters & Commentaries, Exquisite Corpse, La Petite=
 Zine, LIT, Missippi Review, Notre Dame Review and Caketrain.

In 2005 she founded the Mad Hatters' Review, one of the first online journa=
ls with a true multimedia approach, marrying literature, film, art and musi=
c in an annual collage of some of the most explosive arts on the web.  "I e=
nvisioned something real flashy and eccentric, experimental, collaborative,=
 multicultural, playful and even meaningful, in the social change/progressi=
ve sense," she told the webzine Web Del Sol.  "The name of our annual refle=
cts our view of the world as essentially demented and nonsensical, too freq=
uently a nightmare or 'non-dream' that needs to be exposed to the light for=
 what it is, as well as what it is not. However, we, as artists, can also s=
ee another side of this world by voyaging into our own unique terrifying an=
d joyful wonderlands and sharing our visions with others."

Carol curated the successful Mad Hatters' Review reading series at KGB Bar =
in New York, and performed herself at many venues in New York City and else=
where.  After re-settling in Asheville, North Carolina in 2010, she began a=
 new reading series at The Black College Museum & Arts Center and founded a=
 non-profit arts organization, MadHat, Inc., which now includes the Review;=
 MadHat Press, a print publisher; and an artists retreat at her mountain ho=
me in Asheville.

As an editor,  Carol was impressed by wordplay, originality, and writing wi=
th the courage to confront the political. She published and befriended many=
 authors, poets, artists, and filmmakers including, Harold Jaffe, Andrei Co=
drescu, Hugh Fox, Alasdair Gray,George Szirtes and Raymond Federman. As a m=
ultimedia and spoken-word artist, she collaborated with Sheila E. Murphy an=
d many others, recording a CD, Inventions II: Fictions, Fusions and Poems, =
with Don C. Meyers and Benjamin Rush Miller in 2009.

Carol's full-length book of hybrid works, metafictions, prose poems, rants,=
 raves and whatnots, Giraffes in Hiding: The Mythical Memoirs of Carol Nova=
ck, was released by Spuyten Duyvil Press in 2010.

When Dee Sunshine asked Carol where she would chose to travel via time mach=
ine, she said, "Eons of light years from now, towards or back to a cosmos i=
nhabited by wise sentient beings, including cats."  And on life after death=
, she said: "Take away life, take away the breast and breath. Of course, I'=
m not expecting to meet 'God' before I die. I don't believe in religions or=
 fairy tales except as metaphors of the human experience, the wish to be sa=
ved, the wish for happy endings, the absurd trials we set up for ourselves,=
 the meaningful journeys, and always the rules, the rules, the rules. We're=
 a very limited species."

Before her death,  Carol was working several new projects, including the no=
vella Felicia's Nose, in collaboration with Tom Bradley.  Both Felicia's No=
se and a collection of  Carol's shorter works are anticipated for publicati=
on in the near future.

Mad Hat Arts, Inc., including Mad Hatters' Review, MadHat Press and the Ash=
eville Artists and Writers' Little Mountain Retreat is expected to continue=
 operations under the guidance of  Carols' designated successors, with seve=
ral books forthcoming, including, Primate Fox, the last collection of poetr=
y by the late Hugh Fox.

No doubt  Carol saw her own resemblance to the protagonist from her unfinis=
hed novella, Felicia's Nose:  "Thus, Felicia is neither 'kind,' 'good,' 'ha=
ughty,' 'hot,' nor 'pugnacious.' Nor is she not. Like the rest of us, she i=
s wending her way through the minefields of existence, too frequently with =
tight shoes that pinch her feet and will ultimately grow loose with age..."

Carol died peacefully with her friends at her bedside in the Elizabeth Hous=
e Hospice in Flat Rock, North Carolina.

Michael,

A lot of these Greek fragments come from later scholiasts who had
often just basic grammatical problems with the quoted fragments.  In
the case of my Sappho fragment, Sappho uses a non-standard Lesbian
dialectical form 'amme' [literally 'us'] instead of the standard Attic
form ['me' = English 'me'].  See Anne Carson's translations of
Sappho's fragments [*If Not, Winter*, p. 38 (translation) and pp.
365f. (comments) on this particular fragment.

What makes this Sappho fragment so powerful, for me, is that the
ambiguity between "you burn me" and "you burn us" seems to make
Sappho's assertion not just a personal one but a universal one as
well.

In any case, we don't know exactly what she meant, and we haven't
known that for something like 2500 years.  Nevertheless, these two
words continue to ring in our ears, with, I think, enormous meaning,
given their slight weight as just two very little words.

 I mean, there is all of Freud in these two words!  Right?

Can you say the same thing for this Alcaeus fragment, which you cite
and which I haven't been able to locate in my Campbell edition of the
Greek Lyric Poets, nor in my older Loeb editions?

Can you give a context for this Alcaeus passage?

Thanks,

George

RESOLUTION / REVOLUTION : Michael T. Young

We enter the realm of personal resolutions and revolutions with the poetry =
of Michael T. Young. Michael has published two collections of poetry, most =
recently, Transcriptions of Daylight. His chapbook, Living in the Counterpo=
int, is available from Finishing Line Press and his next full-length collec=
tion, The Beautiful Moment of Being Lost, will be published in 2013 by Blac=
k Coffee Press. =E2=80=94 Larissa Shmailo

New Titles for 2012,
and=85<http://furniturepressbooks.com/2012/01/04/4-new-titles-for-2012-and/=
>

2011 was quite a time. Not only did we publish two exciting books, Joshua
Ware=92s* Homage to Homage to Homage to Creeley*, which won the 2010
Furniture Press Poetry Prize, and Ryan Eckes=92 witty and sophisticated *Ol=
d
News*, we also published, with the generous help and talent of Jodi Hoover,
three chapbooks, Nicole Mauro=92s *Tea Party Poems*, a =93fauxlaboration=94
between Emily Dickinson and Sarah Palin, Anne Ashbaugh=92s *Mythopoesis*, a=
nd
Elizabeth Savage=92s *Jane & Paige, or Sister Goose,* *Twenty-Four Women &
Girls*. And if there=92s not enough room in our basement! The Emergent Poet=
s
Series took off with excellent reception. We published Lily Herman=92s *Bet=
ter
than some, not as good as some others*. * *We even pulled off an impressive
Cruellest Month Poetry & Performance Festival, our 6th, at the Towson
Public Library, complemented with a community-wide =94poem walk,=94 in whic=
h
local businesses displayed a range of poems (more than 150 by 23 poets) on
their store fronts or within their premises. And then we participated in
the global 100,000 Poets for Change event, hosting a day-long open reading
(on 33rd street in Baltimore) of poets and aspiring writers from the city
and county and recording more than 100 emergent poets for the Onthology/aud=
io
<http://onthologyaudio.blogspot.com/2011/10/global-feature-100000-poets-for=
-change.html>
series.

As might be obvious, a publishing project such as Furniture Press Books is
not merely about the production of quality books and textual objects. If
not for our reading public, the necessary part of the poetry equation,
there would be no press. This is why we hold the local, our communities and
our neighborhoods, our citizens and neighbors, in the highest esteem. And
we want to give the community a chance to collaborate in the meaning-making
venture, not merely absorb it. Books are vehicles. The community is the
machine. In 2012, we will continue the tradition of community involvement
by furthering our relationships with the local and partner with new and
exciting organizations.

The 7th Annuel Cruellest Month Poetry & Performance Festival
(CruMoPoPerFest<http://crumopoperfest.blogspot.com/>)
will be held at the Village Learning Place in Charles Village, Baltimore
throughout the month of April (dates/performers/readers to come). This
building is the site of an expansive free library, free workshops and
events, and a newly established collection of local writers and presses.
Partnering with a new organization means expanding our own aesthetics to
those outside our small community, and open the way to further
inter-community collaboration, which, in our hopes, will foster the talent
of emergent as well as established poets.

And, so as not to overlook the overarching goal of the press, great books,
we will be publishing a fine collection of poetry of manifest sorts:
William Allegrezza and Garin Cycholl=92s *Aquinas and the Mississippi*,
Shabnam Piryaei=92s *A Method for Counting Days*, Elizabeth Savage=92s *Gra=
mmar*,
Magus Magnus=92 *ReEchoes*, and j. j. hastain=92s *myrrh to re all myth*. T=
he
Emergent Poets Series will start off with Athena Pappas=92 untitled
collection. The details I will leave out. For now=85 But there will be more=
=85

Subject:      Call for subs to Versal 10: One week left!
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello friends,

We're now in our final week of submissions to Versal 10, and I am hoping
you can help us spread the word.

Submissions are lower for us this year, but we've had no drop in the
quality of those submissions (I'd say the average quality went up), and
I'm really excited about the new issue. The drop in numbers, I'm
guessing, is at least in part because of our new fee, but definitely
because we can't show up in Duotrope search/open market results anymore,
which is a bummer, and a circumstance that limits the reach of our call.

So I'm calling on our wider community, those of you who know Versal and
like or even love Versal, for help in getting the word out the old way:
word of mouth. Can you send the call (below) to the writers and artists
you know, have published; post to your Facebook or Twitter or whatnot;
forward to your students, colleagues, local listserve...

My many thanks, and looking forward to seeing and meeting many of you at
AWP.

Best,
Megan

*The Work Office (TWO) is hiring artists for work in the Bronx!*
The Work Office (TWO)
(Bronx NY)

The Work Office (TWO) is now hiring, in partnership with the Bronx River
Art Center!

As part of the =93Shifting Communities=94 exhibition series at the Bronx Ri=
ver
Art Center (BRAC) gallery, TWO is hiring artists to create and present
assignments with a focus on the Bronx, NY. Applications for TWO employment
are being accepted through January 24, 2012. Visit www.theworkoffice.com or
BRAC to apply.

The Work Office (TWO) is a multidisciplinary art project disguised as an
employment agency. Informed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) of
the Great Depression in the 1930s, TWO is a gesture to =93make work=94 for
visual and performing artists, writers, and others by giving them simple,
idea-based assignments that explore, document, and improve daily life in
New York City. From a temporary, publicly accessible office installed at
BRAC, TWO's administrators will hire employees, exhibit work, and
distribute Depression-era wages at a Payday Party on February 10.

TWO is accepting applications for assignments that can be presented at
BRAC=92s gallery. The proposals should explore the relationship between art
and civic life and respond to the unique history and/or nature of the Bronx
through one of the following TWO assignments:

*build a bridge

*reinterpret a newspaper photo

*record an oral history with someone who lives or works in the Bronx

*design a poster to promote something

*make a mixed CD related to places, people, or experiences in the Bronx

*catalog WPA structures in NY

*document a need for repairs

*give a concert for a plant

*make a regional travel guide for a place, neighborhood, or phenomenon in
the Bronx

*start an American tradition

*assign yourself

Applications and instructions are available on TWO=92s website=97
www.theworkoffice.com=97and at BRAC=92s gallery. A TWO administrator will
contact and interview applications of interest by January 26. Interviews
will take place on January 27 and 28. Applications are evaluated based on
the strength and clarity of the proposed response to one of our
assignments, its relationship to the Bronx, and the practicality of
realizing it within a week.

Hired employees must be able to complete their assignments during the
workweek of February 2=968, drop off work at the BRAC gallery on February 9=
,
and attend a public Payday Party on the evening of Friday, February 10. At
the Payday Party, artist/employees will collect their workweek honoraria of
$23.50 for their completed assignment, the weekly wage that artists
received in the Federal One Project (the arts division of the WPA). The
public will be invited to view the week=92s works and learn about the
project. Completed assignments will be publicly exhibited at BRAC=92s galle=
ry
throughout the week of February 11=9618 and on TWO=92s website.

Questions? Write TWO at: apply@theworkoffice.com.

Applications must be submitted by 11:59 PM, January 24.

More visceral than conceptual, this year=92s symposium will gather poets =
for=20
whom the stage and all of its demands, such as voice, projection, sound=20=

effects, lighting, body movement, acting, props, and image, all help crea=
te a=20
new syntactic breadth for the poetic *voice.*  These writers press into n=
ew=20
territories in theater, song, film/video, dance, recitation, digital arts=

Here are some descriptions of the many events that will take place over t=
he=20
four days:

Black Took Collective: Betraying Blackness
A multi-media performance exploring the Black Took Collective=92s=20
interrogations of a black unconscious. Using written and aural language,=20=

sound, video, and images, the members of the collective enact poetries of=
=20
inquiry that engage (and challenge) the psyche's making of racial=20
consciousness by conceptualizing unconsciousness. In so doing, the member=
s=20
of BTC will expose their poetic processes and poetries-in-the-making, mov=
ing=20
through poetries predicated on the conditions of blackness into meditatio=
ns on=20
the multiple factors that inspire our imaginations.

Christine Hume: Speech Talks Back
An audio show that plays the revoicings, manipulations, arrangements, and=
=20
displacements of recorded nonpoetic, nonliterary speech, in a performance=
 of=20
audio documentary poetics that refigures poetry's classic oral qualities.=
 As the=20
pieces play, Christine Hume will offer a voiceover of playful theoretical=
 riffs=20
and expanded contexts for understanding.

Christine Hume: Listening Stations
Audience members will be invited to lie their heads on pillows imbedded w=
ith=20
speakers playing original sonic versions of the work from Christine Hume'=
s=20
Shot, an investigation of night, insomnia and its inextricable dialogue w=
ith a=20

Cecilia Vicu=F1a presents her improvisatory oral performance in response =
to=20
place and time and a walk and conversation with the artist through her si=
te=20
specific installation, specially created for the UA Poetry Center.

Dan Waber: OFF THE PAGENESS workshop
A macro and a micro view of contemporary poetic production:
Macro: Pecha Kucha Tucson (60 different ways of making poetry off the pag=
e=20
today). A way to focus wide-ranging enthusiasms for unusual contemporary=20=

poetic practices.=20
Micro: A look at the very fat line between the visual and the textual, in=
 31=20
examples. If you see the difference between

no=20
fair princess

and

no fair
princess

you understand that text has a signifying visual component. A poem on a p=
age=20
in a book is possibly purely textual. A painting of a figure is possibly =
purely=20
visual. And between these two extremes lives a very wide expanse of=20
exploration which blends the two. The examples we'll see and discuss were=
=20
selected specifically for how difficult they are to pigeon-hole as either=
 textual=20
or visual.

Brent Cunningham: Poets Theater at The Rogue Theatre
Brent Cunningham will present three short plays: The Event, Time's=20
Machinery, and The Gunfight. These works tend to create strict limits and=
=20
strict tasks for themselves, in one case blacking out a key piece of dram=
atic=20
information, in another restricting itself to a common aphorism. In addit=
ion=20
each play utilizes a different formal strategy for selecting and training=
 its non-
professional actors, frequently taking them directly from the audience.=20=

Audience members, get ready for your closeup...

K.J. Holmes and Julie Carr: Dance Performance
=93This is where we are (or take arms against a sea of troubles), an exce=
rpt.=94
And:
Workshop with Julie Carr and K.J. Holmes: Embodying Poetics
Words are a map to the body's landscape. Movement writes us back to=20
language. In this class we will play with tone, horizon, scale and transi=
tion=20
through writing and movement patterns that will support and open up our=20=

senses and perceptions, finding a kinetic base for an embodied poetics.

Douglas Kearney: Talk and Reading with digital projections
Through a combination of digital projections of "performative typography"=
 and=20
live performance, Douglas Kearney will present his explorations with MESS=
.=20
Part talk and part reading, Kearney will mess with notions of poetic dist=
ortion,=20
trope-mapping, raw-chopped samples and the carnally-ecstatic soul singer'=
s=20
wail.

Ander Monson: Into the Labyrinth: Guerrilla Writing=20
Monson will guide writers in creating projects networked across multiple=20=

websites. Why do our poems have to be so self-contained? With the plethor=
a=20
of spaces that the web offers for users to post text or image or somethin=
g in=20
between (as in amazon reviews, craigslist ads, comment boards, personal=20=

websites, facebook walls, ebay listings, okcupid.com ads, etc.) why not, =
like=20
the hackers or graffiti artists we are all at heart, make work that asks =
the=20
reader to bounce from one site to another, even not neglecting the physic=
al=20
codex page that we still love deep inside. We will start projects that re=
quire--
nay, invite and compel--our readers to interact with the architecture of =
the=20
web, essentially a labyrinth. Monson will present some of his own labyrin=
thine=20
work in this direction and direct writers in writing and remaking these=20=

connections.

Claudia Rankine: The Situation series
Video essays that speak into national and international moments in=20
contemporary culture. As artists we wanted to address our visually satura=
ted=20
culture by bringing language to the images we consume. The series attempt=
s=20
to juxtaposition temporal memory alongside historical critique through th=
e=20
layering of sound and image. Each film runs close to five minutes.

Situation One is in dialogue with Zinedine Zidane.
Situation Two is in dialogue with 9/11.
Situation Three is in dialogue with Katrina.
Situation Five is in dialogue with Michelle Alexander's "The New Jim Crow=
".

Undocumented and Here is a new  Situation in process that enters the=20
continuing dialogue regarding what it means to be unauthorized and here.

Your Avatar and You Panel
Topics of discussion will include:

- how ebooks are changing or might change poetry publishing, how the=20
internet has altered the traditional publication and distribution models =
for=20
printed poetry books, what changes to print culture could mean for poets=20=

already allied with a long history of interrupting fixed ideas and identi=
ties.

- how the website presents one avatar for the self, in the way that books=
=20
present another avatar for the self. Considering how self publishing mean=
s the=20
self publishing the self's work, ideas about how we constantly publish th=
e self=20
=85and how the whole authorial persona/avatar/self is self-publishing, a =
series=20
of decisions (and accidents) in the self and how it is made public.

- what it means to be "published" today. What it means to be "well-publis=
hed",=20
how what all of us really want is to be read, how most people don't even=20=

necessarily want to be widely read, but want to be well read. ..opportuni=
ties=20
created by digital outlets have all but solved the problem of how to be=20=

published, even how to be well-published (good design imparts credibility=
), but=20
it has not solved the problem of how to be read, and well-read.=20

- The problem of distribution. How do I get my work read by the people wh=
o=20
can most connect with it? Publishers that use digital technology to help =
make=20
possible some analog things that current models of publishing don't reall=
y=20
support and the problems of digital archiving and archiving the digital.

=0ACarol Novack: A Life Remembered=0A=0ACarol Novack's work is populated by=
 singular, breathtaking glimpses of the human condition, garnered from with=
in a hair's breadth of the abyss.=A0 There are notions in her work of a pri=
mordial =DCbermensch, a shadowy figure hidden within "the collective experi=
ment called mankind." She once said, "I rage against the dark forces within=
 all of us, and the conformity that sickens me."=A0 Yet she approached her =
work and life with humor and verve.=A0 She embraced the absurd, the surreal=
 and the mythological, rubbing them up against each other with her own uniq=
ue rhythm and lyricism.=0A=0AProponents of conventional narrative sometimes=
 criticized her visionary work for its lack of cohesion, a missing red thre=
ad; yet=A0 Carol was not an experimentalist for its own sake.=A0 She sought=
 to discover a voice of reason within the hubbub of myths and neon road sig=
ns; along the way, she broke convention to re-discover, to re-emerge. In he=
r own words: "I don't believe in rules. I take dictation from the flow of m=
etaphors that surface from my unconscious as I write, think of my writing s=
elf as a metaphorist."=0A=0AOf her 2010 book Giraffes in Hiding: The Mythic=
al Memoirs of Carol Novak (Spuyten Duvyil), American Book Review observed: =
" Carol poses metafictional questions about who or what controls our narrat=
ives, and what kinds of power is or is not available through narrative...If=
 only for an instant, the giraffes go into hiding, and the minnows emerge."=
 PANK Journal enthused: "Whilst reading this unique book, I felt I was deep=
-sea diving, surrounded by exotic and breathtaking words-as-creatures, but =
mindful too of the murkiness, sinister and danger that also lurk both under=
 and above water."=0A=0AIn an interview in the Canadian literary journal Me=
tazen, she said she had reached "the overwhelming realization that one must=
 create one's own meaning, the isolated self's confrontation of its own sho=
rt-lived existence, the significance of being human and humane."=0A=0AShe s=
purned literary prizes, institutionalized creative writing programs and all=
 forms of elitism, not only in the arts, but in society in general.=A0 In h=
er twenty-year career as an appellate and trial lawyer, she gave voice to t=
he silenced and marginalized.=A0 "Law," she said, "is a white rabbit that f=
alls into black holes."=A0 She told Glasgow poet, Dee Sunshine in an interv=
iew, "The battles were almost always up very steep hills, and I mistrusted =
and disliked the 'justice' system for various reasons."=A0 Nonetheless, she=
 took pride in her legal work, particularly her written motions and appella=
te briefs, and won an important federal constitutional action on behalf of =
visual artists (Bery v City of New York, et al.).=0A=0ABorn February 19, 19=
48, she grew up in Bell Harbor, New York, the single child of musicologist =
Saul Novack, Dean of Arts and Humanities at Queens College, and Phyllis Nov=
ack, librarian. Of her childhood, she once said, "I grew up with wonderful =
music permeating our house like a bouquet of luscious scents."=0A=0AShe com=
pleted her BA at the University of Rochester in East Asian Studies, moved t=
o Sydney, Australia where she worked as an editor for the Australian Cosmop=
olitan, and began publishing her poetry during the seventies.=A0 A chapbook=
, Living Alone Without a Dictionary, was published by the University of Que=
ensland Press, and her work was included in The Penguin Book of Australian =
Women Poets.=A0 She was the recipient of an Australian Council of the Arts =
writer's grant, remaining in Australia until 1977.=0A=0AAfter a traveling i=
n India and Europe,=A0 Carol returned to New York City where she received h=
er J.D. from New York Law School in 1983. As an attorney, she worked first =
in the Criminal Appeals Bureau of the New York Legal Aid Society and later =
as a solo practitioner, championing the causes of artists and the underpriv=
ileged.=0A=0AShe went on to receive her master's degree in social work (com=
munity organizing), and teach lyrical fiction writing at The Women's Studio=
 Center in NYC, returning to the serious pursuit of her own writing in 2004=
.=A0 "The muse just suddenly reared her jerky head again," she said.=0A=0AF=
rom the mid-2000s, she began publishing her gender-bending hybrid metaficti=
on- "her little aliens," as she called them-in many journals and anthologie=
s, including: American Letters & Commentaries, Exquisite Corpse, La Petite =
Zine, LIT, Missippi Review, Notre Dame Review and Caketrain.=0A=0AIn 2005 s=
he founded the Mad Hatters' Review, one of the first online journals with a=
 true multimedia approach, marrying literature, film, art and music in an a=
nnual collage of some of the most explosive arts on the web.=A0 "I envision=
ed something real flashy and eccentric, experimental, collaborative, multic=
ultural, playful and even meaningful, in the social change/progressive sens=
e," she told the webzine Web Del Sol.=A0 "The name of our annual reflects o=
ur view of the world as essentially demented and nonsensical, too frequentl=
y a nightmare or 'non-dream' that needs to be exposed to the light for what=
 it is, as well as what it is not. However, we, as artists, can also see an=
other side of this world by voyaging into our own unique terrifying and joy=
ful wonderlands and sharing our visions with others."=0A=0ACarol curated th=
e successful Mad Hatters' Review reading series at KGB Bar in New York, and=
 performed herself at many venues in New York City and elsewhere.=A0 After =
re-settling in Asheville, North Carolina in 2010, she began a new reading s=
eries at The Black College Museum & Arts Center and founded a non-profit ar=
ts organization, MadHat, Inc., which now includes the Review; MadHat Press,=
 a print publisher; and an artists retreat at her mountain home in Ashevill=
e.=0A=0AAs an editor,=A0 Carol was impressed by wordplay, originality, and =

ch=20

The Tullamore Rhymers Club were relauched tonight at the home of member Ken=
 Hume. The Rhymers Club is named after the one founded in London at the end=
 of the 19th Century, and its members hope for the promotion of poetry in t=
he area, with particular intrest being poets who write in rhyme.

It is hoped to publish chap books of poetry from the writers group. Meeting=
s are set to be monthly, with informal gatherings in between if needed. New=
 members are encouraged to join who live in the area.

The group was initialy put together in 2010, but efforts to get writers gro=
up actually meeting failed for a variety of reasons, from work to venue iss=
ues. So as the first new year resolution actually kept, tonight we actually=
 got it together!!!

A report on the night is at the link above. Selections from each writer can=
 be read on past issues of Cartys Poetry Journal.

Subject:      The frame-up trial of a Colombian poet
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

_____________________________________


The poet Angye Gaona has been charged formally by the Colombian
government prosecutors.  She is accused of "Rebellion" and "drug
trafficking."  The prosecutors have indicated that this frame-up trial
will begin on 23 January 2012 at the special criminal court in
Cartagena de Indias.

Angye Gaona is completely innocent of these charges!  But she is
considered a nuisance by the ultra-conservative government because her
writings, interviews, and speeches have had a considerable influence
on young Colombians.  But "crime" and "drug trafficking," no, not at
all!

Angye was unexpectedly arrested in January of last year without any
written or formal charge, but was released on caution in July after
much international pressure.  And, now, once again, she is completely
innocent of these frame-up charges and professional defamations!

Angye Gaona, in a number of articles and interviews, has passionately
defended the cause of Colombian Indians, many of whom are being killed
by paramilitary gangs on orders of the land developers.  Angye has
denounced these mass-killings as "genocide."

Also, Angye has defended the cause of working class people and their
unions, who are constantly being repressed by the industrial
conglomerates in Colombia, supported by the government and its Yankee
sponsor.  Indeed, she has denounced the present Colombian government
as "a terrorist government."

If nothing is done, her trial may have a dramatic and tragic outcome.
Indeed, Colombia is known for its dreadful political trials.  At the
moment some 7,000 political prisoners serve long sentences in terrible
and overcrowded prisons.

Therefore, it is necessary to try to make known to the Colombian
judiciary officials that Angye's case is being followed closely
worldwide.

At the moment, it is important that the examining judge receives many
letters, letters asking for a fair trial.  If you want to write such a
letter, the address is as follows ...

Al Sr. Juez de Conocimiento,
Centro de Servicios Juzgado =DAnico Penal
del Circuito Especializado De Cartagena Adjunto
Centro Barrio San Diego,
Calle De La Cruz No 9-42,
Antiguo Colegio Panamericano 2=BA Piso,
Cartagena de Indias,
Colombia, South America

Also, you may send a copy of your letter, by e-mail or postal mail, to
the ambassador or consul for Colombia in your own country, to increase
the pressure.

For your information, I add two links on the case, one in Spanish and
the other in French ...

Hi all,

Thought I'd do a little shameful self-promotion and send out video of the
reading Jerome Rothenberg and I did on October 12th at the Kelly Writers
House at the University of Pennsylvania.

http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Rothenberg.html#10-12-11

Thanks to Charles Bernstein for alerting me to its existence.

I hope everyone is doing well and that 2012 is treating everyone right!

All best,

several languages. She is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships
for her work from such organizations as Poets & Writers, The Jentel
Foundation, Vermont Arts Council and others.

Currently Paige lives in West Addison, Vermont where she is employed at a
homeless shelter in a neighboring town. In her spare time she co-edits the
poetry annual A Handsome Journal, a subsidiary of Black Ocean (Cambridge,
MA.) She is working on a second novel, Made to Lie Down in Green Pastures,
a third collection of poetry, and a lyrical comic book illustrated with
medium format photographs and centered around the life of Kate Marsden,
particularly her time spent in Siberian leper colonies.

Poems by Philip Brooks

Old News | For August
Even Abe Lincoln | Shutterbugs

Philip Brooks grew up in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park "as an
aspiring melancholiac. To that end," he attended the Iowa Writers'
Workshop as a fiction writer. Several of his stories appeared in Gordon
Lish's "defunct but really swell" THE QUARTERLY, others in WILLOW SPRINGS
and THE KENYON REVIEW. Some of his poems have appeared in recent postings
at Elimae.com and Wigleaf.com. He lives in Ohio with his wife and son.

 I see a black kid
 I see a white kid: they play
 I see playing kids!

 - Happy Martin Luther King Day!!!A simple and childish haiku of mine, set =
to outline how children are born loving, but must learn to hate. Remember, =
we are their teachers... they mimic and learn what we say and do...

Hope you enjoy!!!

Dear all,

and more info about the book is here: http://bit.ly/jtinff1.


Regards!
-Jake Marmer

Hello!

The Splinter Generation, a literary journal out of Los Angeles, CA, has
recently published my poem: "TWO STREET, JANUARY FIRST"

The editor writes: "And when defeat comes, as it can, sometimes we find
comfort in hometowns and the promise of a new year as in Paul Siegell=92s=
 TWO
STREET, JANUARY FIRST..."

I hope you'll take a look:

Thank you,

*International Brecht Society Call for Papers*

Modern Language Association Convention, Jan. 3-6, 2013, Boston, MA

Presenters must become MLA members by April 1, 2012 to participate in the
IBS convention sessions (www.mla.org)



1) Brecht and Celan

The session aims to uncover the profound affinities between the two poets
by challenging certain myths about them: Celan=91s poetry is inaccessible,
far removed from concrete material and political space, residing instead in
some realm of pure language; Brecht=92s poetry is derivative of his dramas,
overtly political and deliberately anti-aesthetical in language. Yet there
is a common ground. Celan was a careful reader of Brecht=92s poetry and muc=
h
less hermetic and interested in constructs of pure language than one might
assume, while there is in Brecht=92s poetry a layer of subtle, poetic
language. In addition to a linguistic and aesthetic kinship between Brecht
and Celan, there are also significant thematic overlaps, such as the
concept of kindness, the invocation of a non-metaphysical yet sacred
presence of an =93other,=94 etc.

Send 200 word abstracts by March 9 to: Marc Silberman (mdsilber@wisc.edu)



2) Brecht =96 M=FCller =96 Poetry =96 Language

Collaborative session sponsored by the IBS and MLA Division of 20th-Century
German Literature

There are many connections between Bertolt Brecht and Heiner M=FCller: M=FC=
ller
emulated Brecht as a role model, he extended his work through adaptations
or with alternative projects, and as a young lyric poet he also positioned
himself vis-=E0-vis this mentor.  We seek papers that examine how M=FCller=
=92s
poetry =93translates=94 Brecht=92s poetic language as a mode of textual
expression / expansion.  Brecht advised those who read his poetry that one
should =93not forget his main work was in the theater=94; this holds equall=
y
for M=FCller.  If we take the advice seriously, it suggests that as poets
both were attracted to a spoken German that had for centuries drifted apart
from the written language.  Beyond thematic connections, here we suggest a
new way to focus on M=FCller=92s continuation of Brecht=92s work.

Send 200 word abstracts by March 9 to: Marc Silberman (mdsilber@wisc.edu)

Hello, everyone,

I'm starting a last-minute job search very much in earnest, and would =
truly appreciate some back-channel advice about where I could go, =
including outside of academia, with 20+ years of rather stellar teaching =
experience.  I've been at my current school as a "part time associate =
teaching professor" for 17 years.  I've done academic service on the =
faculty senate, task force committees, as an MFA thesis adviser, as a =
B.A. program adviser, and as a mentor for novice online teachers.  My =
student and peer evaluations have always been superior.  Below is a =
brief list of the courses I created and teach/have taught; I alternate a =
few of them every other semester.  I teach, and have published, both =
poetry and fiction, and am the recipient of a Fulbright Specialist =
grant, among other awards.  Believe me, I am deeply appreciative of any =
time and advice that can be spared, and am of course absolutely willing =
to offer whatever help I can in return. =20

Sincerely,
Sharon Mesmer

Keynotes: Brian Holmes, Continental Drift and Sarah Sharma, University of
North
Carolina at Chapel Hill

"Occupy but better yet, self manage=85. The former option is basically
passive=97the
latter is active and yields tasks and opportunities to contribute.=85 To
occupy
buildings, especially institutions like universities or media, isn=92t just=
 a
matter of call it, or tweet it, and they will come. It is a matter of go ge=
t
them, inform them, inspire them, enlist them, empower them, and they will
come."
  =97 Michael Albert, =93Occupy to Self Manage=94

The unfolding events at Occupy Wall Street and elsewhere present
possibilities
for new politics, and new forms of learning from, living with and engaging
each
other. Occupations are attempts to build the social compositions that are
the
precondition for action. They are the working through of a problem that
politics-as-usual works to suppress=97the massive exploitation that is
capitalism
and the emergence of politics adequate to address it. At this stage,
occupations
are the connection of people, ideas and machines=97the cumulation of
assemblages
that might build something. What happens next depends on what is being buil=
t
now. We invite graduate students from all related disciplines to submit
proposals for academic, artistic and activist presentations and workshops
that
explore and otherwise critically engage occupations.

Please send a 250-word abstract by February 1 to
intersections.occupations@gmail.com or ebiddl@gmail.com. Proposals should
list
paper/panel title, name, institutional affiliation and contact details.

Workshop facilitators: Please provide a timeline indicating the duration
and one
or two general learning objectives of your session, along with space and
technical requirements.

Artists: If sending creative works by email, please limit attachment size
to 5
MB or less, or direct us to a URL. Include viewing instructions, comments
and
titles if applicable. If submitting creative works by post, please mail the
proposal, a copy of the work and viewing instructions to the following

Dear Sharon,

Why don't you try Ed Foster at Stevens Institute in Hoboken? I might bear
fruit.

I hope you are enjoying your new apartment.

In the 1980s Kathy Acker changed her name to Marjorie Lord and moved to Mas=
sapequa, NY.  Her entire wardrobe consisted of outfits she=92d lifted from =
her neighbors=92 clotheslines. Once, she forced a window in search of a bur=
gundy pants suit. As part of her work release program, she reorganized the =
card catalogue at the local library, thus ensuring that each author was pro=
perly denominated.

Brion Gysin submitted poems under the name of =93W.S. Merwin=94 to Antaeus,=
 Poetry and the Paris review, all of which were accepted. The actual Merwin=
 was so pleased by the work that he claimed it for his own, publishing the =
poems in his collection =93Opening the Hand.=94

Willem de Kooning was an inveterate prank caller. (These were the days befo=
re caller ID.) Robert Rauschenberg, who famously could not take a joke, was=
 one of his frequent targets, and Rauschenberg responded by making weekly t=
rips to the Dutch master=92s house in East Hampton where he left bags of bu=
rning dog excrement on the porch.

Craig Dworkin might have said =93Signing a text that one hasn=92t written w=
ill surely become less remarkable, and the next frontier of propriety will =
materialize when conceptual writing antagonizes the institutions of poetry =
by signing for others under texts that they have not written.=94 Whether he=
 meant it remains to be seen.

Four poems by Rae Armantrout

    ACTION POEM


    1

    On screen
    men discover
    that their mothers
    are imposters,
    that their worlds
    unreal.

    Substitution
    is eerie.

    America

    Shes falling
    from level
    to collapsing level
    in someone elses (whose?)
    terrain, through
    floorboards, off bridges,
    firing desperately.

    Someone says, Dream
    bigger, handing us
    an RPG.

Wesleyan published Rae Armantrouts most recent poetry collection, Money
Shot, in January of 2011. Armantrouts previous book, Versed (Wesleyan, 2009),
received the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. It
was a finalist for the National Book Award. Next Life (Wesleyan, 2007),
was chosen as one of the 100 Notable Books of 2007 by The New York Times.
Other recent books include Collected Prose (Singing Horse, 2007), Up to
Speed (Wesleyan, 2004), The Pretext (Green Integer, 2001), and Veil: New
and Selected Poems (Wesleyan University Press, 2001). Her poems have been
included in anthologies such as American Hybrid (Norton, 2009), Postmodern
American Poetry: A Norton Anthology (1993), American Women Poets in the
21st Century: Where Language Meets the Lyric Tradition (Wesleyan, 2002),
The Oxford Book of American Poetry (Oxford, 2006) and The Best American
Poetry of 1988, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2008. Armantrout received an
award in poetry from the Foundation for Contemporary Arts in 2007 and a
Guggenheim Fellowship in 2008. She is Professor of Poetry and Poetics at
the University of California, San Diego. Writing in Poetry magazine, Ange
Mlinko has said, I would trade the bulk of contemporary anecdotal free
verse for more incisive, chilling poetry like Armantrouts. The poems
gathered here are from a manuscript called Just Saying due out in 2013.

Rae Armantrout reads in Ottawa on Saturday, March 3, 2012 as part of
Ottawas second annual VERSeFest poetry festival.

We'd like to bring to your attention:  The latest Black Radish Books
publication is Dana Teen Lomax's DISCLOSURE.

In the age of data mining and identity theft, Dana Teen Lomax's DISCLOSURE
has been called "the new memoir." Recently anthologized in *Against
Expression: An Anthology of Cultural Writing* (Northwestern University
Press, 2011), this work offers a critical interrogation of 21st century
American society that will challenge and amuse. Composed solely of the
found documents of everyday life, DISCLOSURE is documentary poetics as
never seen before.

Into the Blind World
by Barry McKinnon
$4

    into the blind world
    the new life  the essential tremor /refusal
    of diminishment

    I see in a double
    space  conjunction & irony, that part blind Im made
    to see. it is not Dantes forest exactly. More
    so a sense

    /a kind of open door
    is beginning /closing  dark turning
    - light I didnt expect.

    old flesh renews, that the dim
    eye makes almost nothing matter. looks to

    what I find ahead.

    I believe -

    fear kept
    me speaking, or all would cease to be. so I spoke & the forest flew by
    & city lights distorted  the cold stars of love and dark  the
beginning, a journey, a descent

    the ghost of myself still
    alive,
    to address the infected world, to stall & cease advance, to the forest
one fears
    to enter

    sad desire/ without a mask
    to journey solely at night dark to the armies
    circling themselves  the forest of knives
    invisible to those who never make it
    or recognize

    desire: one heart to pull
    the other retract - that the gap maintains its depth & distance

    to hell  the hidden road & the river one dares

    Afterword

    §

    This poem/fragment is based on a selection of lines sent to me by
Arianwen Goronwy Roberts, a young student, poet, and artist who I jokingly
referred to as Virgil one night when she soberly drove me home after a
drunken literary event in the fall of 2009. I got Arianwen curious to read
Dantes Divine Comedy & at some other drunken literary event asked her to
send me the Dante lines or sections that she liked or stood out for
whatever reason. This she did from an on-line translation
(http://www.readprint.cm/work -7/inferno-dante-alighieri: The Divine
Comedy: Hell - no translator given). Within those stanzas, verses, and
narrative fragments I could see certain words/phrasings and images that
prompted my own translation and improvised responses.

    Ive made no dramatic attempt to describe sinners being dipped upside
down in hot tar  or include any of the other dark & menacing monsters
contained in Dantes hell - or developed the relationship between Dante and
Virgil, his poet/guide through hell. Instead, I took only words, phrases
or images from Arianwens choices that I could then reconfigure without, I
decided, any presumption to condense the narrative in Book One, or make
any literal reference to snakes, lizards, and lions etc. (though somehow a
lone fox trotted in).

    The ending does not wholly contain the sanguine possibility Dante
recognized in Canto xxxiv  a return to the bright world- to look once more
upon the stars. More so, I believe it when the poet Robert Creeley writes
- the darkness surrounds us - yet within it we must live and experience
whatever range we are given or decide.

    When the writing stalled, I also took lines/ideas from Arianwens poem
the forest of knives image, Mateusz Patrykas poem for his line the ghost
of myself, Cecil Giscombes email - these days the sisters incoherent,
unrequited, incomplete and Robert Creeleys line happy in hell  sources
that kept me going for awhile longer on the hidden road.

    Otherwise, all else is missing.

It would be nice if you provided a summary of the link. It may even add to =
the number of us who click through to check it out.=20


I'm guilty of it too, but I DO at least tell folks a little bit about the l=

Just a blurb in the subject heading seems kind of rude to me.

Sextet: six poems from Songs for little sleep
by rob mclennan
$4

    Vancouver, specifically
    for Wayde Compton,

    An uneasy mist
    rises from this calligraphy of recollection
    -- Mina Loy, The Lost Lunar Baedecker: Poems


    1.

    What is this, beauty. Failed attempts at, something. Stated aims, a
viaduct. Specific questions, abandoned. Linger. Exploding at the bedrock,
crust. Backwash, a church. A Union, Prior. Streets. A common grave. Or is
it, grace.

    Impossibilities, suffer. Excised, but not divide, subtract. A family
path of clothespins, buttons.

    You aren't front lawn, sophisticate. Subsets claim. A learning made of
kitchens, home. A Georgian demolition, sweep. A lack of rumoured slums.
Estate of longing, else. State, desired looks. Wood sliced into beam, a
streetscape. What aren't we seeing.

    If less abstracted, tell me. A community suffers, scattered. Brow to
leaning brow.

    2.

    Attempts are not, but statements. Lone survivor, speaks dead language.
Restorations. Memory, buffers. Erodes into allotted land. A formless
quilt, afforded. Question, its effects.

    Mortgage is, but this. Your murdered laughter.

    What are we, looking? The look of elsewhere, less. All that glitters.
Little controversies, pass the stupid buck. Strathcona is, a name. The
trees for city, same. The house but not, paved over. Why did you, did?
Could further, else. A glaze.

    Of, the shores. What oxidized. Go. Here, not only. Long, into the east.

Spyker invented a two-day event called the ottawa small press book fair,
and held the first one at the National Archives of Canada..." Spyker moved

~~~~~Apostrophe, Odes, Ekphrasis, Oh My!

For as long as we can remember, poets have addressed the sun and moon,
distant lovers and heroes, while also separately singing odes to the gods.
The Surrealist painter Leonora Carrington once said, "We learn about the
soul, and we have to listen to the soul."  Just as some poets use music for
inspiration, ekphrasis is not simply a description of an art work, but
influenced by the art work and, sometimes, the artist's life. Carrington's
own paintings evidence her own efforts towards querying the world she
inhabited beyond the limits of perception; her life also reveals many
lively, unconventional turns that inspire and provide unexpected
permissions, something poets often require -- consciously or not.

In the course of this workshop, we will look at a the work and lives of a
variety of artists, as well as poets, and consider how ekphrasis can extend
beyond mere description of the visual arts but may also be combined with
address (apostrophe) or incorporate the ode as a means to reflect
appreciation, and content from, an artist's work.

Call: 1-888-NYC-SAFE*,=94 is now so ubiquitous that we seem no longer to se=

it. And yet, ten years after 9/11, this posture of heightened scrutiny and
perpetual estrangement as an expression of our continued concern with
matters of safety and securitization remains. Join us for a decidedly
unconventional gathering, in celebration of the publication of SAFE

Sounds like the makings of a sweet new school!  Now if there's another
recently resigned poet who happens to have a small building in a
neighborhood that needs poetry (i.e., *everywhere*) we're good to go.  Just
got to remember the core economic rule of poetry:* one-by-one*.  And also,
of course, that the economy of poetry works like no other.  In fact I think
the new school should have a course in that radical and magical economics.
Onward!

Reconfigurations 5 is packed with dialogue & figuration, craft & critique, =
difference & innovation, song & vision.  Forty-five poems (eight of which =
are image/texts), two fictions, one portfolio of thirty-three drawings, =
five articles/essays, and one wiki-conversation (with contributions from =
twenty-five writers/scholars).  All submissions and works accepted for =
publication were reviewed by the editorial board and/or by other external =
reviewers.

Reconfigurations is an open-access, annual, independently managed, =
peer-reviewed journal for poetics and poetry & literature and culture that =
aims to build bridges among different communities.

Our work here turns upon generative contradictions.  We are both outside =
of established institutional hierarchies of process and production (we are =
online in the form of a blog) and we are the epitome of such systems (we =
are peer-reviewed).  We seek to gather and present both creative and =
scholarly texts=97a judiciously selected diversity of genres/modes and =
forms of discourse.  We exist as a dynamic space for readers and writers =
invested in tradition and innovation.  Such dedication to both/and, such =
inclusion of opposition, is required by our project of reconfiguration.

We are pleased to offer for sale the Patty [Oldenburg] Mucha Archive

New York City Art World in the Sixties & Seventies

The Patty Mucha Archive features correspondence, manuscripts, artworks, =
documents and ephemera from a wild index of artists, poets, dancers and =
performers active in the era of Pop Art, Happenings, E.A.T., Yippies and =
Punk including: Olga Adorno, David Bradshaw, Joe Brainard, Gregory =
Corso, Jean Dupuy, Bob Dylan, Kenward Elmslie, Deborah Hay, Richard =
Hell, Jasper Johns, Ray Johnson, Ruth Kligman, Billy Kl=FCver, Frosty =
Myers, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Clarice Rivers, Larry =
Rivers, Lucas Samaras, Carolee Schneemann and Andy Warhol to name a few.

Patty Mucha was married to Claes Oldenburg from 1960 to 1970. Not only =
was she Oldenburg=92s muse for his main performance ensemble but =
collaborator for all of his early sewn sculptures. Her contribution to =
the invention of soft sculpture was the result of quickly needing to =
produce large sculptures for Oldenburg=92s first exhibition at the Green =
Gallery in 1962. She appeared in his Ray Gun Theater, which they =
produced in 1962, and collaborated in sewing costumes and constructing =
objects and sets for his Happenings and installations. She appeared in =
Oldenburg films made by Rudy Wurlitzer and Robert Breer as well as in =
films by Jean Dupuy, Rudy Burckhardt, Andy Warhol and Red Grooms. She =
also participated in the Happenings of Jim Dine, Robert Whitman, Dick =
Higgins, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Alex Hay, Steve Paxton, Simone =
Forti, and Sally Gross.

"The forces of evil, it is traditionally believed, always stand by
waiting at that strategic moment like a year ending, to poison the joy
of the community with terrible grief. But a communal speech,
representing the power of the many endorsed by Chukwu-abia-amuma, can
foil such a spiritual conspiracy."

Hi there,

How have you been? I've a cold, and hope it hasn't hit you yet.

A new review of my JAMBANDBOOTLEG has been posted at PhanArt, a site
dedicated to the art of the fans of the band Phish. They have a book revi=
ew
series called: "Read the F#$%ing Book Club."

Perhaps you would take a look? Here's the link:

"This is poetry for the music fan." -- PhanArt=20

As always, many thanks, and I hope this note has found you well.

Very Respectfully Yours,
Paul Siegell

We are pleased to bring you the February 2012 issue.  It's our one year

Founded by artists, Certain Circuits publishes poetry, experimental prose,
art, and new media. We are especially interested in documenting multimedia
collaborative work between artists.

To date we have published 196 posts from artists and collaborators in 13

perfect bound volume 1.1.

We have held readings, screenings, and exhibitions from our artists at the
Rotunda, the Ellen Powell Tiberino Museum, National Mechanics, and Eris
Temple Artspace.

http://www.japanwritersconference.org/

best wishes
Jane

Jane Joritz-Nakagawa's  sixth poetry book, "notational", was published by Otoliths in June, 2011 (http://the-otolith.blogspot.com/): http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/notational/15740264.  A Kindle edition of her 2010 book "incidental music" is now available at Amazon.  A review of both books appeared in The Japan Times in September 2011: http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fb20110918a2.html.  Her poetry broadside, "blank notes," is forthcoming with Country Valley Press.  Her seventh book length collection is in progress.

I wonder if anyone on here knows of any folks who publish poetry
specifically on the topic of recovery.

Thanks!

The first issue of Lightning'd Press will be published online at the end of
February 2012. We are open for submissions. To get an idea of what kinds of
work we want to publish in lieu of reading our archives, please read this
essay by the poet Peter O'Leary regarding Apocalypticism in poetry (
http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/review/55-3%20OLeary.pdf ). Our goal is
to publish poems online that we feel speak to the ideas of Apocalypticism.
At the end of 2012, we will be hand-sewing a limited edition printed
version of the poems we have published online throughout the year. We would
like to work towards being able to release print editions quarterly in the
future because the book as art is what, in our opinion, will be the future
incarnation of printed books in general.

For more information, and submission guidelines, please visit us at:
http://lightningdpress.weebly.com

Thanks!

Jamie & Jeff
