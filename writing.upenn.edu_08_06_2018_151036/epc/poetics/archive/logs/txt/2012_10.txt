Along with fronting the Gris Gris, singer/songwriter/guitarist Greg =20
Ashley also performs as a solo artist, concentrating on the delicately =20=

trippy psych-folk that occasionally makes its way into his band=92s =20
louder, more unpredictable music. Late in 2003, Birdman released his =20
debut album, Medicine Fuck Dream, which drew comparisons to Mayo =20
Thompson and Roky Erickson. Ashley=92s second solo album, Painted =20
Garden, arrived early in 2007, and though it had considerably cleaner =20=

production than his debut, it shared the same free-flowing songwriting =20=

and surreal lyrics. In 2010 he dropped the completely experimental =20
Requiem Mass and Other Experiments on Birdman. The opening title track =20=

(a whole side of a conventional LP) is the preeminent work here, while =20=

Sarah=E2=80=88Riggs
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ENVELOPES
Poetry, 160 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-10-0  original paperback $14
Publication date: September 15, 2012
=20
Begun in the turmoil of moving house, these poems were jotted on =
envelopes because that was the form of paper on hand. But there was more =
to this choice. Oscillating between the US, France and Morocco, living =
on 3 continents and in 3 languages, Sarah Riggs felt the need to address =
her own self in order not to disperse into alternatives. But how do we =
address ourselves? the book asks. How many selves do we have? How do we =
sort what we think from what has been thought for us? Is it that our =
language cannot follow the mind=E2=80=99s rich, fluctuating process or =
does language outrun what the mind can seize? So that we are caught =
between two excesses, two ineffables?
=20
Sarah Riggs is the author of WATERWORK (Chax), CHAIN OF MINISCULE =
DECISIONS IN THE FORM OF A FEELING (Reality Street), 60 TEXTOS (Ugly =
Duckling), and 36 BLACKBERRIES (Juge Editions). Her book of essays, WORD =
SIGHTINGS: POETRY AND VISUAL MEDIA IN STEVENS, BISHOP, AND O=E2=80=99HARA,=
 was published by Routledge in 2002. She has translated or co-translated =
from the French the poets Isabelle Garron, Marie Borel, Etel Adnan, =
Ryoko Sekiguchi, and, most recently, Oscarine Bosquet. A member of the =
bilingual poetry collective, Double Change (www.doublechange.org), and =
founder of the interart non-profit Tamaas (www.tamaas.org), she divides =
her time between the U.S. coasts and Paris, where she is a professor at =
NYU-in-France.

P. Inman
PER SE
Poetry, 88 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN13  978-1-936194-09-4  original paperback $14
Publication date: October 15, 2012
=20
P. Inman radically fractures the conventions of language in order to =
build everything up again from a more elemental level. In per se, the =
composers Luigi Nono, Morton Feldman, Hans Lachenmann provide musical =
structure for his jazz-inflected words in motion. The book lives in the =
tension between the free, multidirectional movement of words and the =
highly orgazined macro-structures.
=20
Peter Inman was born in 1947 and raised on Long Island. He  has worked =
at the Library of Congress and as a labor rep and consultant. His books =
have included: OCKER (Tuumba Press, 1982), RED SHIFT and CRISS CROSS =
(Roof Books, 1988 & 1994), VEL (O Books, 1995), AMOUNTS. TO. (Potes & =
Poets Press, 2000), and AD FINITUM (If P Then Q, 2008).  Forthcoming in =
2013 from If P Then Q, IS WRITTEN, 1976-2012.  He resides in Maryland =
with the poet Tina Darragh.
=20
Inman =E2=80=9Cdestablizes the polarities of form & content=E2=80=A6 By =
fully semanticizing the so-called nonsemantic features of langue, Inman =
creates a dialectic of the recuperable & the unreclaimable, where what =
cannot be claimed is nonetheless most manifest.=E2=80=9D

Elfriede Czurda
ALMOST 1 BOOK / ALMOST 1 LIFE
Poetry,  96 pp, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN13  978-1-936194-12-4
Original paperback $14
Publication date: November 15, 2012 (copies available)
=20
This volume contains almost all of Elfriede Czurda=E2=80=99s first book =
(with the untranslatable title EIN GRIFF =3D EINGRIFF INBEGRIFFEN) and =
all of her second, FAST 1 LEBEN.
Elfriede Czurda comes out of the Wiener Gruppe=E2=80=99s experimental =
tradition. She is especially fond of letting repetition and permutation =
shift words through their whole gamut of meanings=E2=80=94and sometimes =
beyond. However, she is also not averse to thumbing her nose at any =
rigidities, even those of the experimental imperative. In ALMOST 1 LIFE =
(novella? politico-cultural satire?), the ruling avantgarde has licenced =
=E2=80=9Cmonomania=E2=80=9D as official language and punishes misuse by =
expelling the offender =E2=80=94 into reality. Which is where Czurda =
positions herself. She combines exploring language with exploring the =
social power structures embedded in it =E2=80=94 all with lots of fun =
and humor.
=20
 =E2=80=9CCzurda makes strongly visible the fragmentary, arbitrary, =
non-linear... whole chains of associations flood the reader, or language =
itself breaks apart. [Her] powerful language is always =
political.=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94Michael Fisch, DIE BERLINER LITERATURKRITIK
=20
Elfriede Czurda was born in 1946 in Wels, Austria. After 25 years in =
Berlin and some as visiting professor in Japan. she now lives again in =
Vienna. Her work, which includes poetry, prose, essays and radio plays, =
has received numerous prizes, most recently the Austrian =
W=C3=BCrdigungspreis for Literature, 2008. Recent books are DUNKELZIFFER =
(2011), UNTR=C3=9CGLICHER ORTSSINN (2009), AND ICH, WEISS (2008).
Essays on her work can be found in DIE RAMPE: PORTR=C3=84T ELFRIEDE =
CZURDA (2006)
Rosmarie Waldrop has translated, from the German, Friederike Mayr=C3=B6cke=
r, Elke Erb, Oskar Pastior, Gerhard R=C3=BChm, Ulf Stolterfoht and, from =
the French, Edmond Jab=C3=A8s, Emmanuel Hocquard and Jacques Roubaud. =
Her most recent book of poetry is DRIVEN TO ABSTRACTION (New Directions, =
2010). .

S=C3=A9bastien Smirou
MY LORENZO
translated from the French by Andrew Zawacki
Poetry, 120 pages, offset, smyth-sewn
ISBN 978-1-936194-08-7  original paperback $14
Publication date: May 15, 2012
=20
MY LORENZO is an elegant, funny, often sad meditation on the =
fifteenth-century Italian statesman, art patron, and poet Lorenzo de =
Medici. Obliquely and eccentrically narrated, it is as concerned with =
pysical arrangement as it is with linguistic ambiguity and matters =
philosophical, political, and sentimental. MY LORENZO is striking =
visually for its justified  stanzas and tableau-like shape. Reading the =
book is akin to touring the Uffizi, its Renaissance paintings hung =
meticulously on  the walls.
 MY LORENZO combines traditional form with an unapologetically modern =
idiom that draws on pop culture and shuttles vertiginously between =
theoryspeak and speakeasy slang.
 (This work, published as part of a program providing publication =
assistance, received financial support from the French Ministry of =
Foreign Affairs, the Cultural Services of the French Embassy in the =
United States and FACE [French American Cultural Exchange]).
=20
     S=C3=A9bastien Smirou is the author of three volumes of poetry. He =
is a psychoanalyst, with a specialization in working with troubled =
children, and lives in Montrouge, on the outskirts of Paris.
     Andrew Zawacki is the author of three poetry books=E2=80=94PETALS =
OF ZERO PETALS OF ONE (Talisman House), ANABRANCH (Wesleyan), and BY =
REASON OF BREAKINGS (Georgia). Coeditor of VERSE, editor of AFTERWARDS: =
SLOVENIAN WRITING 1945-1995 (White Pine), he has also co-translated =
Ale=C5=A1 Debeljak=E2=80=99s WITHOUT ANESTHESIA (forthcoming from =
Persea). He teaches at the University of Georgia.

was a featured exhibitor in our first exhibition, "Collaborate

Originally from Pakistan and now living in Los Angeles, Sara Suleman
is showing the digital animation,=E2=80=9CConverge=E2=80=9D which represent=
s =E2=80=9Cthe
interstitial gap between reality and fantasy, a time when birds
converge in the sky out of their own accord, denoting freedom and
movement. This happens as a daily occurrence in Karachi. By
transforming it in drawing, I seek to trace out the patterns of the
birds and recreate their movement in my imagination- light, ambiguous,
circling-- slicing their way across the expanse of the blank screen."
Sara works in various media, ranging from photography to Installation.
Her work is inspired by observations and sketches from daily life. She
has exhibited in numerous exhibitions including the Philadelphia Asian
American Film Festival, the Erasing Borders Exhibition at the Queens
Museum, and Aicon Gallery, New York City, among others.

	They swam in moonlight,

	These constant, language carves. I dream of summer, distant-green.
	here, the sun cools. Porcelain. Up, Ottawa Valley.

	Phil Hall suggests, a frozen glow. Silence, is its only form.
	
	The unexpected path. We sequence. Perfection, thus. Third-hand,
	paramours. Unsettled, through the sky. Moment, fetish, this one.
	Small. Enjoy.

	There is no single moment.

dissections from their biography
kevin mcpherson eckhoff
$4

	You are each unique snowflake. Kevin is her mother's son with ten original
	sauces: spicy, virtues like puppy warmth, saucy and explicity tarnished.
	He was born in her village of several piqued interests. An ungainly
	warrant to circumvent the queue or whatever strokes, she identified a new
	generic strain in her spare time of which we are all the general
	inheritors. So, she began in a small town and she will live and dye in his
	small town of Weaverron, b.c. Her biography delisted from fame sites. I
	smell rubbery goodness in him and a gentle womanly love for all things
	small and hairy. It's me spring day, men from Anismouth visit when I'm
	shy. I'll call us together like teeth and dildos on picnic, eat parades of
	youth, or share old versions of each other's habitual shot records. That's
	her, shining and young and her. Mostly irreverent yet factually astute.
	Her massive glands and tiny shouts, little hands and huge hair. We eat to
	her delight, dear Kevin. I have found you at last, cowering, sheltered in
	her and apoplectic. The streets awake and look for small towns in which to
	retire. From inside, an inside delightedly yours. My story filled with
	vomit yet shiny, slick and parasitic. Missing you? Not now.

=E2=80=9COne way of understanding the sacraments . . . is that simple thin=
gs become central things. When Christians refer to the bath and the table,=
 they refer not only to the specific sacraments of bathing and eating, but=
 they point also to the sacramental character of every bath and every tabl=
e. The setting apart of one table and one bath shows forth the splendor of=
 all tables and all baths. That setting apart is the calling of Christians=
 but also the vocation of the writer. The attentiveness of the writer is s=
hown in how that writer lifts to the level of extraordinary the most ordin=
ary of people, places, and things.=E2=80=9D

ok. it took us a lot of years of arguing, but we now have a few full
tuition assistantships at mills.

if you've got some bright u/gs wanting to get an mfa, please ask them to
apply.

they don't come with a stipend. just fyi. but students don't teach
either. instead, they work with a faculty member to develop a community
attentive project of some sort while they are at mills. the project idea
is wide open. the application requires the submission of a one page
description of what the project might be. the projects so far have been
super great.

(and there are opportunities to add to this teaching assistantships and
other sorts of aid in the second year, but still it isn't going to add
up to $20k as at some schools.)

Subject:      On Cross-Pollination: An interview with Camille Martin by James
              Pickersgill
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

My "world premiere" of Looms will be in Cobourg, Ontario, about an hour's
train ride east of Toronto.

Poet James Pickersgill put together some thought-provoking interview
questions in advance of the reading. Below is a sample, and the complete
interview can be found here:

http://www.poetrycobourg.ca/Camille%20Martin%20Q%26A.htm
*
Q - Camille, it is not at all true that poetry is your single creative
outlet. You are known as a collage artist, too. You are an editor yourself
... and a translator. Your own work has been translated into other
languages as well. You have been a university teacher. You've organized
poetry reading series. You've had radio shows and you blog actively on the
internet. When listed like that, these activities might sound like an array
of separate pigeon-holes but I suspect that there is a lot of
cross-pollination, so to speak. What is the nature of this creativity as
you experience it: one spark that finds many openings to jump into flame,
or, can it be distinct and separate creative impetuses?

* *Camille Martin* - I love the idea of cross-pollination. In fact, I think
my primary creative impulse is to bring together: to merge or to juxtapose.
It's the basic impetus for the metaphor: to bring unlike things into
dialogue. And for me, that goes for disciplines as well. I was reading and
seeking out poetry on my own from an early age, though I didn't begin
writing it in earnest until my late 30s. But my first creative expression
was musical - I was trained as a classical pianist since I was six years
old, and I went on to get a graduate degree in piano performance. I was
also intensely interested in visual art. I've always felt a desire to bring
the arts together. So now, in the autumn of my life, I have the pleasure of
doing all three: making collages, writing poetry, and setting my poetry to
music. I think these disciplines are sparking conversations among each
another.

* * *

Cheers!
Camille

The new ebook from Argotist Ebooks is =E2=80=9CNeither Us nor Them: Poetry =
Anthologies, Canon Building and the Silencing of William Bronk=E2=80=9D by =
David Clippinger=20
=20
Description:
=20
The twentieth century witnessed the proliferation of the poetry anthology, =
and perhaps none was so instrumental in reshaping the poetry canon than Don=
ald Allen=E2=80=99s New American Poetry, which introduced many readers to t=
he Beat writers, the Black Mountain School, as well as New York City poets.=
 Allen=E2=80=99s anthology was organized around a concept of poetry communi=
ties, and was one of the first to foreground group =E2=80=9Cidentity=E2=80=
=9D as a canonical practice. As most readers of Donald Allen=E2=80=99s grou=
ndbreaking anthology are aware, William Bronk is not included in the cast o=
f poets assembled within The New American Poetry. But what might be surpris=
ing to many is that Bronk was invited by Allen to contribute to the antholo=
gy and he was the final person to be cut from the final manuscript. Neither=
 Us Nor Them uses William Bronk=E2=80=99s poetry and letters as a window to=
 survey the construction of The New American Poetry anthology=E2=80=94as we=
ll as an opportunity to explore the generation of poetry communities as vit=
al to the canon making process. The case of William Bronk is, therefore, il=
luminating both in terms of the late 1950s/early 1960s poetry scene as well=
 as in the canonical debates that have occurred since then and rendered mat=
erially at the level of the anthology

Edward Foster's Dire Straits<http://www.marshhawkpress.org/Foster4.html>:

"Edward Foster's . . . poems suspend themselves just above language, connot=
ative of some understanding - perhaps common to all of us - that recedes at=
 the brink of words. It is just on this cusp, with some doubt, some explain=
ing, that we find Foster, and trust him to guide us on an impossible course=
."
-Brooklyn Rail

"Foster writes with great economy. His words feel chiseled and dovetailed i=
nto place. Like Zukofsky, Foster evinces the meticulous care of a seasoned =
cabinet maker. But it is out of this economy that he finds the richness tha=
t he is looking for.... Foster, who likes the muted registers and stunning =
clarity of the black and white photography he often includes in his books, =
is engrossed by the dialectic between art and life and the complexities and=
 ambiguities of human emotion. This is his strait. His narrows. He doesn't =
just articulate ideas, he struggles against them. His poetry has as edgy un=
dercurrent. It doesn't settle. It searches for where the words begin."- Joh=
n Olson

Sandy McIntosh's Cemetery Chess, Selected and New Poems<http://www.marshhaw=
kpress.org/McIntosh5.html>:

"McIntosh's imagination is so vivid that the primary response to [his poetr=
y] is delight." -American Book Review

"I don't like people calling writing 'gorgeous' but this really is gorgeous=
 writing. What a crazy/delicious world McIntosh invents."-Lanford Wilson

Paul Pines's Divine Madness<http://www.marshhawkpress.org/Pines2.html>:

"[. . .] an extended meditation on...the psychic wormholes that allow insta=
ntaneous travel along our internal galaxies, that hide just underneath the =
next memory, the next sentence, and behind the all, the ALL itself-unknowab=
le, perhaps, but in Pines' poetry nearly imaginable." - American Book Revie=
w

"Pines goes right to the radical nature of metaphor in poetry, not ornament=
 but sudden discernment:  sharp observation of historical events and natura=
l things leads directly, deeply, to moral awareness.  His lines seem to que=
stion the assertions they embody:  interrogate by interruption.  He is the =
quiet sage who makes everything in his room a tender plaything."   - Robert=
 Kelly

“What we have here is the ideal Primer for the Gradual Understanding of
Charles Bernstein: the coverage is wide, & all you need is “to be ready,
not prepared.” You will not be asked to lounge on the couch as nobody
remembers its colors, but the essays come in all colors, except sad.
Enjoy, & then get back to the poems.” —Pierre Joris

“A major poet for our time — & then some – Charles Bernstein has emerged
as a principal voice –maybe the best we have – for an international
avant-garde now in its second century of visions & revisions. It is in
celebration of this that the Salt Companion to his work appears here, to
show him in a trajectory from an American-centered language poetry in
the 1970s to an active & significant relation to a constantly renewing &
expanding global poetry in which his singularity has played a vital
role. What becomes clear in these pages is how his generosity of mind &
spirit continues to enrich us all.
” —Jerome Rothenberg

Subject:      above/ground press: 20th anniversary subscriptions!

It might be hard to believe, but 2013 marks TWENTY YEARS of above/ground
press, going way way back to those small publications long since buried in
boxes (did you see the photos and report from the 19th anniversary
reading?). What was I thinking?

But it means that the 2013 annual subscriptions are now available as well:
$50 (in the United States, $50 US; $75 international) for everything
above/ground press makes from now until the end of 2013.

http://www.abovegroundpress.blogspot.com/2012/10/aboveground-press-20th-anniversary.html

There are a whole bunch of publications in the works for 2013, but I'm not
going to mention any names. This year has been one of the most active ones
the press has enjoyed so far, and I'm planning a number of excitements
over the next fourteen months. Why not take a chance and find out what?
Already, new chapbooks are in the works by Deborah Poe, Seth Landman,
Allison Greyhurst, Mark Cochrane, Shannon Maguire and plenty more.

You can either send a cheque (payable to rob mclennan) to 402 McLeod
Street #3, Ottawa ON K2P 1A5 or drop the money on the Paypal button at
www.robmclennan.blogspot.com

And keep checking notices for The Factory Reading Series (including two
events in November!).

There's so much more to come...

Little Songs
from The Blue Gazebo
by John Allman

His "Little Songs," John Allman says, are "sonnet-size poems," thirty-three of
them, "some indeed being sonnets," that taken together make up the second of
three parts of The Blue Gazebo, his ninth full-length collection of poems.

Born in 1935, and initially raised in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New
York City, John Allman, author of eight book-length collections of poetry, two
chapbooks, and a volume of short stories, was a high-school drop-out who earned
his diploma in night school while working as a lab tech for Pepsi-Cola.
Eventually turning away from science for the humanities, and knocking about in
many jobs, he earned degrees in English Literature and Creative Writing from
Hunter College and Syracuse University (where he worked with Delmore Schwartz
and Philip Booth), while becoming more and more involved in writing poetry.

At the age of 44, after some years of having his work appear in journals, he
published his first book, Walking Four Ways in the Wind (1979), with Princeton
University Press in its Princeton Series of Contemporary Poets. His most recent
poetry collections are Loew's Triboro (2004), Lowcountry (2007), both from New
Directions, and Algorithms, prose poems (2012) from Quale Press. His Inhabited
World: New & Selected Poems 1970-1995 (1995) was published by the Wallace
Stevens Society Press. His recently completed collections, Older Than Our
Fathers and The Blue Gazebo, are making the rounds, looking for a publisher.

Allman has received two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, a
Pushcart Prize in Poetry, and the Helen Bullis Prize from the original Poetry
Northwest. He earned his living teaching college English and retired from that
in 1997, to have more time for writing. He lives in Katonah, NY, with his wife,
Eileen, a Shakespeare and Jacobean Drama scholar and writer. They spend their
winters on Hilton Head Island, SC.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

This is the Introduction and first three pages of a new project, titled
"Writing Home."
The letters written home are  "the creative process of making a home, in
which I am both host and guest."

More letters will be added over time, and perhaps the Introduction will
be revised as the project reveals more of itself.
As with many of my recent projects, the process is public, and comments
are welcome.

Global Islands Project -- ongoing series of multi-media pdf-ebooks/field-recordings -- a
pastoral, pictorial and phonic elicitation of island parameters. An intensive
examination of small islands and their paradigmatic solutions to globalism...
Ethnographically a shared world of historical experience -- not the romanticized and
divided universe of them and us.


Your feudal-world is based on mutual relief at your common corruption. Maybe some
cultures are based on even worse. But that wouldn't change the bad faith of it and as
years go by, you wake at night in terror of your whole life being an act of bad faith,
where everything is self-interest and nothing more, where every human interaction is
driven by a silent, even subconscious calculation of some ulterior motive, to the point
that a sea of bad faith has taken over your whole life, there's no small island left
from which you can even try to build a bridge of good faith, because even that effort
becomes suspect, even good faith is nothing but self-interested, even altruism is
nothing but solipsistic, even your professed agonizing right here right now is nothing
but a gesture, made to the conscience in order to assure it that it exists.

You cannot politically defy the institutions when all you really wanted

the very framework of oppressive values you are thinking of overcoming.
That would be co-optation, revolution only in the sense of a circulation

Anyone know where I could view Lionel Kearns' cine-poems created with
Gordon Payne?

A couple of titles:

"The Birth of God" (1973)
"Negotiating a New Canadian Constitution" (1974)

Many thanks.

Home: Public or Private?
Artists' Talk

Saturday, October 20th
from 12-1:30pm

at 6018NORTH
6018 N. Kenmore
in Chicago's Edgewater neighborhood
http://www.facebook.com/events/116408688515680

Caroline Picard moderates artists discussing their work from the exhibitions Home: Public or Private? and The Happiness Project.

Artists include:
Jennifer Karmin, Kirstin Leenaars, Lise Haller Baggeston, Harold Mendez,
Meredith and Anna, Carron Little, Troy Briggs, Rebecca Beachy, and Collective Cleaners

We all know public art but what does it mean for an artist to make art for the public, in public? What is "in public" and who is a "public"?  Judith Butler recently questioned Hannah Arendt's "the space of public appearance" stating that we need to ask the purpose of public space, how a public forms, who appears where and when, doing what, and what are the conditions that supports this appearance?  This discussion asks what is "the space of public appearance" for an artist and is there a distinction between work made for "the space of public appearance vs. work that is made for the studio and gallery? Who is the public (or plurality) that work is being made for, and how is this public (or plurality) meant to respond?

Home: Public or Private?
an exhibition of installations & performances at 6018NORTH

October 5th-28th
Guided private tours: Saturdays at 2pm & 4pm and Sundays at 2pm
RSVP at http://6018north.weebly.com/rsvp-for-the-home-show.html

What happens when our private life becomes public and public space becomes private?  Located in a mansion on the north side of Chicago, the exhibition presents multiple artists exploring this question through installations within the rooms of the house. The investigations and activities presented explore the social, cultural, and political ramifications of our shifting conceptions of public and private space.

Artists include: Teresa Albor, Lise Haller Baggesen, Rebecca Beachy, Sandra Binion, Troy Briggs, Deborah Boardman, Sandra Binion, Cuppola Bobber, Keith Buchholz, Chelsea Culp and Ben Foch, Collective Cleaners, Meg Duguid, Daniela Ehemann, Maria Gaspar, Jane Jerardi, Jennifer Karmin, Nance Klehm, Joseph Kramer with Radius, Carron Little, Trevor Martin and Victoria Fowler, Lou Mallozzi, Jesus Mejia and Ruth, Harold Mendez, Katrina Petrauskas, Jesse Schlesinger & Vintage Theatre Collective.

Home: Public or Private? is sponsored by Chicago Artists Month.
6018NORTH is a non-profit space for experimental culture, installation, performance, and sound.

reference--a consummately civilized response to our time that makes the
intimate and the physical still primary despite the generalizing chaos
Heller confronts so movingly."--Robert Creeley*

**

*"...tone perfect poems-the tone, the scale, note by note, interval by
interval--attack on the 'gods of ennui and loneliness.'" --George Oppen*

what a fascinating project, Joel. Personal without being confessional, all
inclusive, and in a voice I can believe in. An overarching idea without any
sort of narrowly conceived architecture.

As some of you know, Diane and I had been planning an extended visit to =
New York early next year and counting on an exchange of residences (New =
York and San Diego) that would have made life very easy.  Sadly the =
friend with whom we were exchanging had to back out, but ever undaunted =
we're planning to go ahead with a modified version and are again looking =
for a sublet or other arrangement -- basically for the entire month of =
March or possibly for both March and February, with all of which we're =
really quite flexible.  So we're asking again whether you have any leads =
or suggestions and can pass them along to us.  I'll also be reading on =
March 13 at the Saint Marks Poetry Project, sharing the evening with =
Heriberto Yepez, as a kind of launch or pre-launch of the big Reader of =
my work that he and I have been co-editing for Black Widow Press.  So I =
hope that will give us a chance to get together, to which we greatly =
look forward.

With warm embraces
for all of you,

JERRY

Subject:      Raymond Souster (January 15, 1921 - October 19, 2012)

As Bruce Meyer posted this afternoon on Facebook:

  Yesterday Canadian poetry lost one of its giants with the passing of
  Raymond Souster. He was the first in Canada to take up the poetics of
  William Carlos Williams. His career spanned generations. I saw him about a
  year ago and his brilliant mind was still sharp though he was physically
  infirm. We talked for about six hours, until I was exhausted. He didn't
  want me to leave. His life was Canadian poetry. Rest in peace, Ray. See
  you at the World Series.

  The author of more than fifty volumes of poetry, he live the entirety of
  his life in Toronto, and was once called the citys most loved poet. If you
  can find Stephen Cain's essay, Sousters Toronto, I would highly recommend
  it.

With the email he originally sent out, James Deahl included this short bio
for Souster that he wrote for a publication called The Ambassador:

  Raymond Souster was born in Toronto during 1921 and has been a leading
  member of the Great Generation for the past 70 years. Souster won the
  Governor General's Award for poetry in 1964 (for The Colour of the Times),
  was presented with Canada's Centennial Medal in 1967, won the City of
  Toronto Book award in 1979 (for Hanging In), and was made an Officer of
  the Order of Canada in 1995. He was a founding member of the League of
  Canadian Poets and served as LCP President from 1967 to 1971. He is the
  author of well over 70 books, largely of poetry, most recently Easy Does
  It and Never Counting the Cost.

  Souster served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. In the
  1950s, he edited first Contact and later Combustion, the foremost Canadian
  poetry magazines of their day. He also ran Contact Press for 15 years
  (1952 - 1967), which published many of Canada's most important
  contemporary poets. Souster lives in Toronto with his wife Rosalia.

Hi Camille,

Both of those works are part of On Lionel Kearns at http://vispo.com/kearns
.

To view this piece, you need to install the free Shockwave plugin from
http://vispo.com/sw . On Lionel Kearns is an interactive piece. Move your
mouse over the screen as you experience it and click on stuff.

On Friday night, Lionel and I did a reading/presentation in Vancouver at the
Peoples' Co-op Bookstore. Lionel presented and read some new ideas/poems,
and I presented On Lionel Kearns. I did On Lionel Kearns in 2004 before I'd
met Lionel, actually. We'd struck up a conversation on the old canpoetics
list. I was amazed that he was doing so much work that's toward digital
poetics back in the sixties-through-eighties. The only other Canadian poet
who was doing work toward digital poetics at that time, so far as I know,
was bpNichol. Chris Funkhouser used one of Lionel's poems as the epigraph to
his book on the history of digital poetry.

UnlikelyStories.org, please resend. If you have work accepted in the
Interdependency Issue, please resend.* Fortunately I have a current
“acceptance list” for the Interdependency Issue, and will work to track

*the morphine poems* succeeds as language breaks through language,
metastasizes through the harboring of pain. The words spread across the
page with a content all their own; uncanny, they haunt the body. Paragraphs
of disorderly text are ordered; a poetics of life against death seeps
through. This is an important and powerful book, concerned with illness
that almost tends towards a pathology of speech itself. The body refuses to
disappear and the words simultaneously convey despair, heartbreak, and
resistance. Bobbi Lurie writes unsparingly about sickness and wayward
health in a brave and detailed cartography of body and biography, creating
a work of brilliance and renewal. Everyone should read this book, which is
everyone's journey, one way or another, a journey from life into life. It
is a journey that is all too often shamefully hidden, a journey we need to
contemplate and embrace. =97*Alan Sondheim*

In *the morphine poems*, Bobbi Lurie spares herself and her reader from

4000 WORDS 4000 DEAD

For the past four years, poet and artist Jennifer Karmin has been collecting submissions of words as a memorial to the 4,487 American soldiers killed in Iraq. These words also create a public poem given away to passing pedestrians during street performances around the country. Throughout October 2012, she has been transposing the elegy onto the walls of a dilapidated Chicago mansion utilizing the American flag as her writing utensil. 4000 Words 4000 Dead will conclude on Veterans Day and be published by Sona Books.

*TRAIN PERFORMANCE:

This project is part of the show Home: Public or Private? and presented by 6018NORTH, a non-profit space for experimental culture, installation, performance, and sound. What happens when our private life becomes public and public space becomes private? Located in a mansion on the north side of Chicago, the exhibition presents multiple artists exploring this question through installations within the rooms of the house. The investigations and activities presented explore the social, cultural, and political ramifications of our shifting conceptions of public and private space.

Artists include: Teresa Albor, Lise Haller Baggesen, Rebecca Beachy, Sandra Binion, Troy Briggs, Deborah Boardman, Sandra Binion, Cuppola Bobber, Keith Buchholz, Chelsea Culp and Ben Foch, Collective Cleaners, Meg Duguid, Daniela Ehemann, Maria Gaspar, Jane Jerardi, Jennifer Karmin, Nance Klehm, Joseph Kramer with Radius, Carron Little, Trevor Martin and Victoria Fowler, Lou Mallozzi, Jesus Mejia and Ruth, Harold Mendez, Katrina Petrauskas, Jesse Schlesinger & Vintage Theatre Collective.

Subject:      Harry Crosby - influence?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Folks,
One of my students, Neal Stidham, is writing on Harry Crosby as poet and
publisher.  The Rothenberg anthologies have helped to give Crosby some
visibility even as his major works have gone out of print.

An issue of interest is -- what poets have read, been influenced by, or
responded to Crosby in their work? We've found a surprising few.

So now the appeal to the broad readers of poetics ....

Can you think of poets, or specific poems, informed by or responsive to
Harry Crosby?

Thanks!

Ken Sherwood

Cuneiform Press is pleased to announce the publication of two new titles:

TERRACE FENCE by BILL BERKSON
While living in Bolinas, poet and critic Bill Berkson produced Terrace Fence, a
minimal, conceptual, yet intimate book of black and white photographs in an
edition of ten or fewer. This seminal piece of protest literature was reproduced
in the summer of 2012 in an edition of 100. The text was printed letterpress on
pure cotton paper and the photographs were reproduced from the original paste-up
and tipped in by hand. Each copy has been signed by the author. $20

SPIRIT PHOTOGRAPHY: A FIRESIDE BOOK OF GURUS by ZEPHYRUS IMAGE
Spirit Photography: A Fireside Book of Gurus (1973) by Michael Myers and
Holbrook Teter is arguably the greatest book produced by Zephyrus Image. Spirit
Photography is essential reading for anyone interested in photography,
conceptual art, artistsâ€™ books, and the unique cultural climate of the Bay Area
in the '70s. This facsimile was printed letterpress and is faithful to the
original in every way, right down to the errata slip. $12

I was happy to see rob mclennan's enthusiastic review of LOOMS - an excerpt=
:

"There is such an expansiveness to Martin=92s Looms. The poems exist in tha=
t
magical place where words, images and ideas collide, creating connections
that previously had never been."

The rest of the review is here:
http://robmclennan.blogspot.ca/2012/10/camille-martin-looms.html

LOOMS is now available at SPD . . .

http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781848612358/looms.aspx

. . . . as well as most any other online source or bookstore.

Cheers!
Camille

Meredith Quartermain: In tightly woven tapestry, Martin's =93backstreet
songs=94 re-invent a music of knowledge that navigates the hucksterism and
catastrophe threatening our planet. The movement of her threads is
fugue-like, punctuated by oboes and clarinets, mockingbirds and cicadas.
Here, in the dream-space of time-lapse film, forms of life and ideas
collide and morph, rippling through centuries of human consciousness to
unravel as quickly as they ravel. Here, above all, Martin makes it possible
to dance among our =93origins in snake oil,=94 our =93crusades to mirages=
=94 and
our =93accidental fictions.=94

Arielle Greenberg: =93A dreamscape on the outskirts of town, =93in the badl=
ands
of the vernacular,=94 these hopeful, haunted poems populated by children an=
d
prisoners =93hover between=94 realms domestic and exterior, real and imagin=
ed.
Like candles described herein, this book gives off a melting, tactile glow.=
=94

Description: The title of Looms signifies the weaving tool as well as the
shadowing appearance of something, These "woven tales" were inspired by
Barbara Guest's statement that a tale "doesn't tell the truth about itself;
it tells us what it dreams about." The strands of their surreal allegories
converse, one idea giving rise to another, and the paths of their dialogue
become the fabric of the narrative. In a second meaning, something that
looms remains in a state of imminent arrival. Such are these tales, like
parables with infinitely deferred lessons.
