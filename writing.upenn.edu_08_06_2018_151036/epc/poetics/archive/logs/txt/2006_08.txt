hey steve:  i can put up with a lot of crap, believe me... just
search back through the last 13 years of the list archives---you'll
find some real juicy exchanges there...

but in saying i was "plugging" my wife's book, i merely wanted to
disclose the fact that i'm related to the person whose work i'm, uhm,
plugging... i was in point of fact responding to a request for info
from my friend mark wallace, who asked for info specifically on the
*u.s. govt's* approach to civilians in military conflict (not to
events prior to 1776)... the book i cited is more than useful in this
regard, or so say all of us...

and while i'm at it, i think you're dead wrong about the now... the
now makes no sense at all w/o a sense of history, and one reason
(though surely not the only one) why the now is so fucked up is b/c
the people in positions of power have not a clue as to the history
they've been busy intervening in with materiel and the like... read
patricia nelson limerick's work, for instance, and you get the
distinct impression that the situation in iraq might have been
avoided had the people in charge studied the history of u.s./native
conflict... or perhaps this is wishful thinking?...

at any rate, let me put it this way:  READ A BOOK, FOR CHRISTSAKES.
you can certainly do worse, esp. if you wield power... and if all you
bring to this kind of discussion space is a desire to bypass history,
well---of course you're free to have at, but to me that's a waste of
processing power...

now:  having explained myself, steve, i'd like to know whether you
still feel it's worth your while to jump on my shit?

please advise

That WTC argument is perilously close to Ward Churchill's, which I =
always thought reflected a lack of understand about the day to day lives =
of "ordinary" people (and thus had an unfortunate way of justifying =
criticisms against academics as "removed" from the so-called "real =
world".)

As someone who has had to work temp for years to support her art and =
writing, I can assure you that you don't have to fuck anyone over to be =
a secretary (temp or perm) or an entry level office worker or intern =
chained to a photocopier and plenty of those died on Tuesday morning =
nearly 5 years ago.  In this economy, if you want a decent paying job, =
you are often going to end up in a corporation that is "evil" to a =
greater or lesser extent.  There are degrees of choices--such working =
for a banking company vs. working for someone that is directly making =
the weapons to send to Iraq.  And there are degrees of decision making =
and involvement in the work of the company.  It's been my experience =
that most Americans hate their jobs and only those at the very top even =
care if the company makes money or not.  Making a Powerpoint =
presentation for the help desk is hardly on a par with signing a death =
warrant to Auschwitz or napalming a village.  There are not enough =
"pure" jobs for every American to have a decent standard of living (not =
even talking about "affluence") without such compromises.  The =
consequences you speak of are more consequences of being an American in =
a global capitalist economy.  Or merely the consequence of the accident =
of the country and class and family and historical moment you are born =
into.

I was visiting NYC on 9/11 and staying with some artist friends, one of =
whom worked temp as a graphic designer for Lehman Brothers and happened =
not to go into work on Tuesday because we had sat up drinking the night =
before.

So, to put it in the "voice" expressed below:

SHE DID NOT FUCK OVER ANYONE TO GET THERE AND GET THAT JOB AND SHE WAS =
NOT THAT "INVESTED" IN WHAT THE COMPANY DID OR WHO THEY WERE FUCKING =
OVER AND SHE WAS RELATIVELY "INNOCENT" AND JUST TRYING TO PAY THE RENT =
ON THE ONE ROOM NOT ZONED TO LIVE IN APARTMENT THEY HAD OVER THE FLOWER =
SHOP IN MIDTOWN . . .

Anyone who has never had to make these kinds of choices or compromises =
to pay their rent and lights and student loans, should thank their lucky =
stars for the privilege to be able to maintain that level of purity. =20

Sorry, but I get touchy about these accusations that everyone in those =
buildings was somehow "guilty" or more guilty than any other American, =
and I hear it repeated way too often on the Left without really being =
questioned.

That said, regarding the comparison to the Middle East, I agree that =
there is no side with a "moral high ground," which perhaps was what you =
were trying to say. If you're going to attack America, the Pentagon and =
the WTC are the right symbolic and actual targets.  But there are =
innocent people working there, walking down the street, living next door =
just as there are innocent people married to, related to, living with, =
living next door to, shopping in the same marketplace as (etc.)people =
who carry out terrorist acts (or acts of war, if you prefer).=20

Be careful about those big giant broad generalizations. That's the =
mindset that keeps us ending up in these situations in the first place.

Cheers.

The minimalist concrete poetry site at:

http://www.logolalia.com/minimalistconcretepoetry/

has been updated with 13 pieces by nick-e melville.

I am drawn to the clean, the simple, the elegant, the crisp, the
sharp, the absolute no-room-for-error stripped down-ness of the
minimal. I really dig the leveraging of language's visual properties
to augment or multiply meaning. I find all of this in the work of
nick-e melville, and I believe you will, too.

Enjoy,
Dan

  than is my point fluffy - you (we) are all guilty enough (as every other / any other AMERICAN) for some other people to decide that it's ok to take down those buildings or bomb that village or humiliate that prisoner or shoot that cab driver or drive that SUV - people make these decision all the time (throughout all time) - now you can insist that there is a RIGHT and WRONG about it if it makes you sleep better - but  guess what,  fluffy everyone else is making a decisions that makes them RIGHT too.

  sometime it's all about being meat.

  i'm not interested in being a better person i'm interested in being a real person.


  don't ask me for a solution
  i'm in the problem identification game
  solution are for fucking priests, politicians and english teachers .

This is more than a complaint about the recent personal

It's the anonymity of the attacker which infuriates and
disgusts me the most.

Artaud's Oatmeal is the pseudonym used, which I firmly
believe is the very same poet also using the Spicer Girl
pseudonym on occasion.  Maybe I want them to be the
same, force them into one because I can't bear the thought
of more than one cowardly poet in Philadelphia.

Spicer Girl openly admitted the home base, while Artaud's
Oatmeal was tracked by Jessica's ISP to Philadelphia.

Courage is in short supply it seems some days, but is it
wrong to expect MORE from poets?

What kind of world are you manifesting Artaud's Oatmeal?
How is it possible you found the courage to create poems
but lack the courage to stand behind your convictions?

And, furthermore, is the IRONY LOST ON YOU that you
choose Artaud and Spicer, two very strong poets who hid
for no one, for nothing?  How dare you!  You scum!

And what DRIVES you to hide behind these masks I wonder?
Is it that you don't want to jeopardize some magical poetry
"career" festering in your imagination?

Isn't it BETTER to be hated for what you believe than to be
liked because no one really knows your beliefs?

You are pathetic!  Artaud and Spicer would vomit in your
direction for using their names as your weapon!

If you ever admit your true identity, I promise to make
certain everyone knows who you were when you were
busy pretending to be so tough.

By the way, are you moving out of Philadelphia soon--
I HOPE!?  Isn't it bad enough the carpet bagger real estate
bastards have arrived to destroy our beautiful brownstones
and community gardens for their luxury condominiums?
Is it asking too fucking much for our poets to be honest here?

Completely fucking disgusted,
CAConrad

Hello everyone,

The submission period for the Blackbox summer gallery is now open, and will
close on Monday, August 14th.  I apologize for the very short window for
submissions, but my own latest book is going to press -- and with proofs,
corrections, distribution, cataloging, etc., I simply don't have much time for Blackbox
this time around.  I don't want to miss a gallery, but I must get it on line
fairly quickly.

Remember to please follow the guidelines on the Blackbox page.  Go to
WilliamJamesAustin.com and follow the Blackbox link to access the guidelines and to
check out the galleries.  Be sure to submit to Blackboxwja@aol.com.  I've set
up that address for the sole purpose of receiving submissions.  I get so much
mail, including lots of spam, at the Austinwja address, that it's possible I
will accidentally delete a submission sent to that address.  It happened once,
and I don't want it to happen again.  I value each and every submission that
comes my way.

As always, sincere thanks to all of you who contribute to, and support, my
project.

Best, Bill

    It's like sleeping in water breathing in water it's like, beads of sweat popping inside your clothes in little wet flowers, little wet mouths. The cigarette sits on the desk before me. How long have I inhabited this divine confusion, where you define finitude as somewhat slanted and enchanted? Five common PHP design patterns, she says, but while she sleeps this sleek sincere elation. I haven't been outside in days. It's a bit like holding your breath until your blood cries out from the dust, froid, froid, froid! You've seen that movie, haven't you? In your sleep your hair dances within the currents. I crush my breath out on it as it waves by, and I think about the many ways we have to represent water, how hard it is for 3-D Computer Graphics to represent these in-betweens of states of mater, liquid and haze, smoke and ocean, fire, fire, fire.
 I think too of the gradations. There is only the Literal, my dear, and these shades are just other states we know exist, but rarely touch. Why do we limit what we know to these abrupt endings?

Call for Submissions
Title: Iconoclasts and Visionaries, a Levantine anthology
Editor: Jordan Elgrably
Deadline: September 30, 2006
Publication: Winter 2007

To celebrate the fifth anniversary of Levantine Cultural Center in Los
Angeles, the editor seeks contributions of creative nonfiction (essay,
travel, first-person narrative), short stories, poetry, one-act plays,
art and photography for "Iconoclasts and Visionaries, a Levantine
anthology".

The title choice reflects a fundamental belief that artists and writers
are often iconoclasts and visionaries by virtue of their pan-cultural,
activist approach-rarely allowing politics, religion or other such
considerations to stop them from crossing literal or figurative borders.
Often in the U.S. media, the countries and cultures of North Africa and
the Middle East are presented through a lens of conflict. The language
of the "clash of civilizations" or Orientalism creates a pervasive sense
of "us and them." The contributions in this anthology intend to serve as
a counterweight to such dichotomous thinking. The anthology should
create a rich reading and visual experience that ultimately defies myth
and stereotype about Arab/Muslim or other West Asian cultures.

Contributions that focus on personal experience over academic writing or
journalism are preferred. Complex thinking that emphasizes the nuances
of culture and identity, rather than narrow political or religious
arguments, is welcome. Contributors need not be ethnically Middle
Eastern to have their work considered.

Maximum word length for nonfiction, short stories and one-act plays is
3,000 words. Poetry, submit a maximum of three poems of any length.
Art/photography, submit up to five images in low-res jpg format for
previewing.

All manuscripts submitted by September 30, 2006 will be considered.
Unpublished submissions are preferred, but previously published work
will be considered. Contributors will receive three copies of the book
upon publication and an honorarium.

Submit manuscripts and visual work to jordane@levantinecenter.org
<mailto:jordane@levantinecenter.org> or via snail mail to Levantine
Center, 8424A Santa Monica Blvd., N. 789, West Hollywood CA 90069.

Does anyone have a copy of Oppen's COLLECTED POEMS (not the New, not
the Selected). I'm trying to track down Kenner's blurb on the back
cover, something about "an oeuvre growing" for twenty-five years...

An exact quote would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

"At long last, in his sixty-eighth year, George Oppen's work can be had in
one volume instead of five-lus: twenty-four pages of new poems, annexed to a
handsome resetting of earlier books. Those were thin books, and
particiaption in the bulk of a single volume now changes the import of every
poem. Ther first sequence dates from l934. All these years academe (alas) is
about to discover, and Oeuvre has been growing."   Hi Stephen, Lou

hi joe and thanks.  i agree that history has everything to do with this.
it isn't just now.  and, as i said before, it started way before the
1800s.  the existence of the united states is based on slaughter.  the
puritans thought nothing of wholesale slaughter.  after king philip's war
there were only _400_ (that's 400) wampanoags left.  anyone read _american
holocaust_ by haunaui kay trask's partner (can't remember his name right
now)?  i edited a dissertation by a guy in poli sci at uh manoa--he was
saying, and i agree, that a state that gets its nationhood by terrorism
will continue as a terroristic state.  that's what we've got.  same with
england and the normans.  same with lots of countries.  best, gabe

The attacking of civillians goes back to the beginning of our civilization =
when the Galactic Overlord Xenu cast billions of civilians into a volcano a=
nd snuffed out the life of our clam-like pre-historic ancestors.

Has anyone read this book?  Does anyone know whether it was written in the
1970s or recently?  I downloaded the title story and read that.  It is "new
narrative."  The blurb suggests that it is part of the history of that movement,
which is intriguing, but there is no foreword that I see or other explanation
of it.  AMB

Thanks to Catherine, Joe, Tom, Kass, Murat and others
for their interesting answers to my questions.

A couple of points occur to me: it seems then that
we're looking at less than a 50-year window, at best,
between the defining of "civilian" as a term in
English and the U.S. decision that attacking civilians
before attacking armies might be the way to win wars
or murder and destroy dissident populations (and
leaving the issue of elsewhere in the world aside for
the moment, such as 19th century British colonies). To
be identified as a civilian is to be highlighted as
non-military, and therefore quickly and specifically
targeted. It's interesting and terrifying to see how
this fact parallels other identifying terms for groups
and the repurcussions that follow; the concept of the
homosexual in the 1890s, for instance.

I wonder if the term "civilian" was created originally
within the military.

Lastly, it's very striking that the changes in U.S.
policy towards Indians and Sherman's march on Georgia
happen essentially within a year or two of each other.
I wonder if anyone has looked at the connection of
these two things?

Mark

     My great grandmother was the only surviving member of the large group
of Ojibway Indians of which she was a part who had been herded aboard trains
to supposedly be taken to a reservation.  The blankets given everyone were
infected with smallpox--biological warfare courtesy the US Govt.

     The word civilian comes from the Romans and passed into English very
long ago via French, as originally a term for a ciivil judge, un civilien. I
found on line some letters by Cicero iin which he reminesecnces with friends
about their cilvilian ife.  The distinction is clearly made between civilian
and the military, and also later between civilian and the ecclesiastical.
Different laws apply among them.
      The slaughter of civilians is as old as war.  The Roman conquest of
Carthage for example--everyone killed, everything razed to the ground, and
the ground covered in salt so that nothing would grow where Carthage had
been.  Agent Orange anyone?  Or the irradiated landscapes in Iraq from the
First Gulf War and the present one.
       And what of Troy?  And countless populations through countless
periods of time, the world over.
        I was reading today about the Cathars, their extraordinary culture,
religion, society.  When war on them was declared by the Pope, accompanied
by the first verison of the Inquisition, before it found its famous home in
Spain,  it was a war of total extermination.
         It was from this war of genocide that came the famous saying--"Kill
them all and let God sort them out." This was the reply given by a commander
when one of his men asked how  they could possibly proceed against the
population when there was no way to tell a Cathar apart from a non-Cathar.
        About ten days ago I saw an interview with a top ranking Israeli
official explaining the "reasons" why it is justified to be wiping out the
Palestinians in Gaza and destroying Lebanon to save it from Hezbollah.  The
"reasons" given were eerily similar to a speech I had read given by a US
Federal Commander on the eve of attacking an Indian settlement and killing
everyone in it--at the time almost al women and children as the men were
outside the settlement to keep the slaughter away from their families.
While reflecting on this, a parallel often drawn, (the USA vs Indians, the
Israeli treatment of Palestinians), a commentator came on and showed on the
screen a quote from a Nazi Commander which was literally word for word the
same as the Israeli's.
       Remember that during the American Civil War in both th North and
South were brutal prison camps in which prisoners were beaten, tortured,
starved to death. This same inhuman treatment had been given to the slave
population and to the Indians being rounded up and transferred to the
concentration camps of remote reservations--the difference being that these
were not soldiers.
        The term civilian comes from "civilis" and has to do with living in
the city, being bound to the laws of the city, and also making a distinction
between the city dweller's "civil" manners and those of the rude
"barabarians" and country dwellers, peasants, etc.  "Civilian" conveys a
sense of lawful and also civilized behaviour, hence certainly non-military!
This ideal is at the heart of having civilians in charge of the military, as
is supposed to be the case in the USA.
           The difference between a State and a terrorist is that the state
has a military, a territory, a government. The state can commit terrorist
acts on a far greater scale than any terrorist, who is in many ways when not
literally as are the Palestinians or were the American Indians and the
European Jews,  civilians without a "civilis" in the terms on which States
agree.
            The terms "terrorism" and the modern "citizen" both emerged from
the French Revolution.
              That's been an important linking ever since, for the State to
make and use in its justifications, and for the citizen to see as a final
resort against the State's terrorism.

Dear all:

To be honest, one does not always know what team to
play on - especially when many of us are new to
sharing thoughts in this kind of forum or submitting
work to a larger audience. As we know, these
professions we've chosen often entail knowing a bit of
the dog-eat-dog and other political-type musings. This
has all become more complex for me, this trying to
understand and make a comfortable connection, given
both my travels and comittment to human dignity. And I
am being completely sincere, so would appreciate some
thoughtfulness.

China is certainly not free, and I am sure about this,
and not as an authority, but as one who has moved
around, as they say, in high and low culture, areas of
organized crime and supposed circles of intelligensia
(the traveller bit of me) - in addition to reading all
the writing available on the subject. And no, it is
not at like what Eastern Europe became, was, because I
was there amid the excitement and Havel. Just
returning from wedding just outside of Prague, my own,
this especially is true for me (and there also have
been numerous discussions had, especially with those
damn Tibetans and folk up in Xingiang).

The feeling in China is quite different, unsettling
for me, in fact - the mood really an exploitive one,
and everyone here is here, mostly, is gain something.
Contrary to some, I would argue that China is not the
most interesting story today - other than to say that
its hype is certainly interesting.

I was invited by a magazine, the possibility of a
cover story included in what was an offer, by an expat
friend, to submit work - to most probably have work
published. It was done with fervor, excitement, and I
certainly thought it great to see my work in print in
China. I submitted from India, but after further
discussions with some of my friends there, Tibetan,
and further exploration into these topics we've heard
endlessly till point of numbing disconnection (and
appreciating the reality that things have gotten
worse), I requested my work no longer be considered.

My rationale was, and I believe it was the right thing
to do, that with so many writers jailed or imprisoned,
killed or who've simply run away to places of exile,
how could I, an American raised on Ginsburg and
Creeley, among others, exploit a situation not
otherwise offered - permitted - to individuals whose
work is definitely more vital than my own. How could I
act in collusion with a system acting against what
voice most requires.

What is our responsibility in these times, where
sometimes can be heard: What is in it for me. I would
appreciate your thoughts.

AlexJ.

I apologize for the bad form. I can't seem to get used

BOOK DESCRIPTION:
Zombies and Wittgenstein bracket a series of autonomous zones populated by
the Book, Harry Partch, 100 Questions, shadows, holograms, the Subject, the
author himself, and numerous pronouns.  These Unprotected Texts flood the tones of
speech wrenched from the bent notes of a life lived looking for a connection
to "the conversation" which takes place among musics of meaning.  Sex and text
are synonymous here.  "Is this speech balloon a rubber?"

ADVANCE WORDS:
There is a powerfully osmotic draw to this welcome volume of Selected Poems,
spanning nearly thirty years of work and concluding with a stimulating
interview of the author by Tom Fink and Crag Hill. That this book is overdue, results
in a level of concentration that intensifies the experience of reading. The
poetry itself, the intellect and personality that exude from it, reveal a mind
and heart that bring to the fore the infinite variety of life in the late 20th
and early 21st Centuries. References to composer and musical theorist Harry
Partch seem apt, as Beckett's Unprotected Texts reveal intervals in sound,
discovering heretofore undiscovered instruments.

There is Beckett as designer who "underpaints." Beckett as builder: "Stanzas
are rooms in Italian." Beckett as political and social observer: "Is the
president a hologram?" "Do fingerprints have babies?" Beckett as aesthetic
investigator: "At some point I turned out to be my method." "Closure affects
circumference." Beckett as honest individual/ articulate creator: "It's a boy and it's
a girl." "Often I am permitted to do absolutely nothing that I want to do."
--Sheila E. Murphy


For three decades now, Tom Beckett has been writing the most hard-headed,
clear-eyed, unsentimental poetry in America. He has the rigor of a master & the
mind of a first-rate detective. Long before the internet made it relatively
easier for a poet to work from somewhere other than one of the two or three major
literary centers, Beckett was writing poems from deep inside Ohio that ring
as true -- and as clearly -- now as when they were first written.
--Ron Silliman


BIO:
Well known for editing The Difficulties (1980-1990), a now legendary critical
journal, Tom Beckett has long been associated with the Language Poets.  His
"The Picture Window" (included in this volume) was published in Ron Silliman's
landmark anthology In the American Tree.  More recently, he has become a
popular figure in the world of blogs. Unprotected Texts is comprised of work taken
in whole or part from broadsides,  chapbooks, journals, online and other
publications.  It is his first, much anticipated, full-length book.  He lives in
Kent, Ohio.

Yes, D-B Chirot's historical renderings of Civilian-Religio-Military
demarcations versus 'barbarian' are helpful.
Yes, my grandmother was part Wiyot - a tribe around Humboldt Bay in Norther=
n
California. Estimated to be 1500 to 2,000 members in 1845, it was reduced t=
o
100 full blooded members by 1910. Some of the worst slaughter of Indian
tribes occurred in this part of California between 1850 and 1865. The Matol=
e
people, for example, were totally wiped out. None, of the them, to my
knowledge, were ever referred to as civilians - though, ironically, some
non-Indians refer to the Cherokees as 'the most civilized of the tribes or
peoples.
My grandmother's grandmother and sister - at the ages of 10 and 12 - were
probably spared in the Table Bluff massacre in the early 1860's, and
kidnapped and raised by a settler family that lived near Cape Mendocino (th=
e
furthest point west in the U.S.A.) Such children were often treated as
slaves - cheap farm labor for the family. One imagines sexual exploitation
was often the case, as well; 'marriages' happened with settler men (a
paucity of white women). Etc.  One imagines - I don't know - that for an
Indian woman totally displaced from family and people - that marrying a
settler - ironically enough - was a way to become 'a civilian.'
Such marriages - though common through out the west - could be dangerous.
Two men are buried on the family property allegedly because they were shot
trying to murder someone married to a 'squaw' - one who he actually
accompanied in public and treated with respect.

As to the current issues of 'civilian' versus 'barbarian', 'Christian and
Jews' versus 'terrorist or Muslim' it continues to strike me that 'we' are
mpw thrown back into antiquarian modes (if 'we', indeed, ever fully left
them). Some part of me wonders if "Capitalism" - a kind of meta-preson -  i=
s
going to get really upset along this way and say, Stop, you are not just
killing people, you're killing markets - we have been selling lots of cars,
etc. in Lebanon, etc.

Looking dreadful out there - and imagining 'out there' is going to be 'in
here' among 'the civilians' more than too soon.

Some part of me wonders if "Capitalism" - a kind of meta-preson -  is
going to get really upset along this way and say, Stop, you are not just
killing people, you're killing markets - we have been selling lots of cars,
etc. in Lebanon, etc.

it seems reasonable that this will be the case. christ (ha!), george bush
discusses alternative fueled vehicles which certainly isn't a commitment to
the environment

On Tuesday, Aug 1, Joe Amato forwarded the following

At the Fort Snelling State Park visitor center there
is an extensive display documenting the Dakota
internment camp where 1600 Dakota were imprisoned
after the war.  It is stated there that this may in
fact have been the first concentration camp.  Hundreds
died there, and eventually the surviving Dakota were
put on river boats and shipped to Nebraska and the
Dakotas.  There is a memorial in the park right by the
visitor center, but there is also a public swimming
beach and recreational bike & hiking trails nearby.

We seem to have perfected ways to ignore the
ramifications of our past (and current policies).  Why
let the basic acknowledgement of our horrific history
(and current events) get in the way of our continuing
recreational and entertainment opportunities?

It's the American way, ain't it?

peace, love and understanding (never give up)

you are forgetting that reconstruction is worth billions--witness haliburton
worldwide --and in iraq--
all the destoryed autos wll need to be replaced, all the infrastructure,
cities and towns--
billions to be made from blowing people and things sky high--first with
armaments then with rebuilding--

"where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price"
"when shit is worth money, the poor will be born without assholes"
"amost every desire of a poor person is a punishable offense"

there is always more money to be made by the rich, no matter the situation

--i thought maybe the _ethics_ or _cost of discipleship_ would have
something relevant to the discussion of "civilians" -- and also critical of
christian empire -- but in the limited time i have i think the following on
"enemies" -- since if i follow this discussion the problem, at least in
part, is a classification of "civilian" as "enemy" -- Bonhoeffer argued that
in praying for the enemy one became vicariously bound with them before God
-- a salvific act -- there is no question in this text i think that
"civilian" and "enemy" are the same -- perhaps this is a problem with the
way the notion of "enemy" is passed down in the theological literature --
the only real enemy is the one inside the self anyway

i think it is well-known that hitler studied both the US policies
toward indigenous people -the reservation system in particular -as
well as the Turkish genocide of the Armenians in arriving at the
concentration camps and the death camps, the final solution.

so why is there any surprise at the methods being used recently?

  everyone everywhere has had lots of practise it seems

  and the most people are aware of some sorta of slaughter that is not widely known, so much so that it's not a surprise when you hear of another one

  so is any of it right ?

  is it all wrong?

  or are people just animals that can speak and write and make up gods and make up morals and not think about how we are really unable to reach the lofty goals that we dream and how we are really unable to look at ourselves honestly and see what we are

  i have no problems expecting the worst of my fellow man and when they are throwing around terms like "innocents" and "victims" and "immoral" - i expect them to be particular depraved in the violence that they do

  of coarse be sure to label me a sociopath if it helps

defense and demonstration of some adventurous and nonstandard modes of
essay-writing, and a suggestion of a kind of utopian horizon for
poetry/poetics. A major collection by one of the most important poets
and critics writing today, it is a proper (and improper) successor to
The Pink Guitar.”
—Hank Lazer, coeditor, Modern and Contemporary Poetics

Rachel Blau DuPlessis is a poet, critic, and Professor of English at
Temple University. She is the author/editor of more than 20 volumes of
poetry and criticism.


THE PINK GUITAR

Writing as Feminist Practice
Rachel Blau DuPlessis

A landmark study of women’s writing and poetics—now back in print!

“One of the boldest, most enlightening, innovative, challenging, and
knowledgeable works of feminist theory to grace the last couple of
decades.”—Martha Nell Smith, Tulsa Studies in Women’s Literature

“Establishes a powerful feminist writing practice not because of
DuPlessis’s refusal of authority, transcendence, and singularity, but
because of the ways she redeploys these.”—Jeanne Heuving, Contemporary
Literature

so, the response to the expectation of it (i do expect it too from some
quarters) is to become a relativist?  that's why i spoke of hume and
reality.  it's easy to say "people are just animals" etc., but what do we
do if we let our hearts be shattered by the things that go on and go on
and go on happening?  that's the only way change happens--and it does.
best, gabe

Its a piece I wrote a few days ago and I know there's something wrong with
it, I just dont know what excactly. Any help is greatly apreciated.


A Mind in Oscillation

These were tremendous things, the mad man and I
In capital city, wandering the ruins of Illium
Another day, we witnessed that holy lightening
Our mechanisms in love with the message
& at night, the smoke caked to our faces
Mouths dry, the crack of beers at 4 am
Echoing across time and space
Again, we spoke,
Heads full of inebriants, the world recorded in all our senses
New sounds spilling from the left and right speakers
We spoke in a seizure, frantic & spiraling
We spoke, then, with more urgency than the banter of the day
Kinetic blasts illuminated the space between our skulls,
From our verbal nexus radiation propelled beyond the stars

The news, nausea, fuel, ignites the room
--So many would have died, so many could have drowned--
Fear of life, fear of death, ablaze between us
Our words danced, ritual fires heated to the point of flash
--We live in an age of information, one of horror, one of terror--
Chromosomes re-informed and archetypes recalled
The room filled with amniotic fluid

Weary, we doused the flames
Arms open to the temporary chains of sleep.

Then, the morning light
Penetrating through the blinds, barely filling the dark apartment
Behind a mountain of furniture, table littered with cigarette butts
The self proclaimed renegade pilot sleeps &
In the matrix of spinning color I feel the rug
and finally fall to rest.

i have kids i can't hug right now because i'm away from them, so i'm
hugging my mom and helping her regain dignity and joy in her life.  i
forward current event emails to a large group of people.  i try to eat
local food and will go to a peace rally on saturday.  i like the "act of
tomorrow."

Dear Friend,

I thought you might be interested in this TrueMajority
e-activism campaign to support a ceasefire in the Middle East.
There are a number of inititatives in Congress to support a
ceasefire of one sort or another, but many representatives have
not yet joined it. If you go to the URL below you can check out
what is at stake and send your own message directly to your
Congressional representative. Take action on this action alert
from TrueMajority at
http://action.truemajority.org/campaign/middleeastceasefire?rk=2pAh4Dn10XrSW

I am happy to forward this reading announcement. For me particularly good
news/occasion re Beverly Dahlen. Her "A Reading" series has found a new hom=
e
at Instance Press (Elizabeth Robinson et al, editors). At Momo's Press, we
published the "A - 1 -7" in 1985, followed by a Chax and a Potes & Poets
volumes. This volume must be up to A - 18 and beyond. (Momo's Press also
published her first book, Out of the Third).
A founding editor with Frances Jaffer and Katheen Fraser of However, her
formative years were in close critical association and friendship with
George Stanley.

I am scheduling for the year at Larry's poetry forum in Columbus & am wondering if anyone will be through Columbus on a Monday between October and the first week in May and can commit to a 7 pm reading. Larry's Poetry Forum has between 33 to 36 readings a year, in 2006-07 we will have prize winning poets ranging from a National Poetry Series winner to a Ohio Lottery $2 scratch off awardee. It does pay, funded by the Ohio Arts Council, books sell briskly, longest running consecutive series in Ohio. Backchannel me.

  Be well--

I AM SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING TO RESPOND TO PROPOGANDISTS LIKE ADEEENA KARASICK. IT IS A TYPICAL TACTIC OF ANY OPPRESSOR TO USE SOMEONE FROM THE OPPRESSED COMMUNITY TO LEGITIMIZE THEIR PROJECT.

  SO HAVING AN ARAB PYCHOLOGIST SAY THAT ARABS, MUSLIMS ARE AT FAULT (TOTALLY EXONERATING GUILTY PARTIES SUCH AS BUSH, ISRAEL, ETC.) IS BRILLIANT!

  AND PERSONALLY IN A TIME WHEN INNOCENT LEBANESE ARE BEING DAILY SLAUGHTERED BY ISRAEL, I FIND THIS POST DISGUSTING.

  IN TERMS OF AL JEEZERA- I THINK THE FACT THEY AIRED THE INTERVIEW PROVES THEY ARE NOT A TOOL OF AL-QAIDA AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS ASSERTED- BUT RATHER A LEGITIMATE NEWS SERVICE AIRING OPINIONS THAT RUN THE SPECTRUM.

  BUT AGAIN, WHAT THE FUCK DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH POETICS?

I've seen my fair share of displays of self-hate in the past, but this one'=
s
gotta rank high up there. I give her credit, though--she certainly made the
most of her airtime.

from Simone Weil, in Robert Coles, _Simone Weil: A Modern Pilgrimage_ -- as
if it were possible to leave the fields where she worked -- a propos of
nothing i guess -- except plant life and its intimacies rendered totally
other

"All noises have their meaning, they are all rhythmic, they fuse into a kind
of giant respiration of the working collectivity in which it is exhilirating
to play one's part.  And because the sense of solitude is not touched,
participation becomes even more exhilirating.  Pursuing our hypothetical
lead, there are only the metallic noises, the turning wheels, the bite of
metal upon metal; noises that speak neither of nature or of life, but of the
serious, steady, uninterrupted acting of men upon things.  Though lost in
this great hum, one also dominates it; for over this permanent, yet
ever-changing drone bass, what stands out while somehow fused with it, is
the sound of one's machine.  One does not feel insignificant as in a crowd,
but indispensable.  The transmission belts, supposing them to be present,
allow the eye to drink in that unity of rhythm which the whole body feels
through the sounds and the barely perceptible vibration of everything.
Through the wan hours of winter mournings and evenings when only the
electric lights are shining, all the senses are participants in a universe
where nothing recalls nature, where nothing is gratuitous, where everything
is sheer impact, the painful yet conquering impact of man upon matter.  The
lamps, the belts, the noise, the hard-cold iron-work, all converge toward
the transmutation of man into workman."

I think this section from Annie Dillard completes the thought

"Plunge into matter," Teilhard said--and at another time, "Plunge into God."
  And he said this fine thing: "By means of all created things, without
exception, the divine assails us, penetrates us, and molds us.  We imagined
it as distant and inaccessible, whereas in fact we live steeped in its
burning layers."

Dear Paul Catafago:

=20

What (the fuck) do you have to do with poetics?

=20

I think of all people you (should) understand the link between poetics =
and politics, and yet your question, shouted and yet so obviously inane, =
belies your real intent: to be belligerent, to be a bully, to be =
abusive.

=20

I can tell from what you write and what you do, Paul, that you believe =
yourself to be someone who stands up for the downtrodden. But as someone =
who also tries to stand up for the downtrodden, I want to tell you that =
you cannot stand up for the downtrodden if you in turn tread other =
people down with aggression and insults. I will go further, Paul: your =
behavior embarrasses me, because so often I want to agree with what you =
say, and yet I am alienated and offended by how you say it.

=20

Let me be clear: I am calling you out in a public forum. I am tired of =
the way that you abuse people, whether you know them or don=E2=80=99t, =
both in public and in private correspondence, and so I am calling you =
out. I call on you to find a better, more responsible way to communicate =
with people, express your views, and demonstrate that the best way of =
standing up for the downtrodden is to help them to true strength, =
instead of covering up your own weakness with aggressive posturing and =
abuse.

=20

As Wafa Sultan said: you can believe in stones, until you start throwing =
them at me.

The metaphor of Indra's Jeweled Net is attributed to an ancient Buddhist
named *_Tu-Shun_*
<http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/tu-shun.html> (557-640
B.C.E.) who asks us to envision a vast net that:

    * at each juncture there lies a jewel;
    * each jewel reflects all the other jewels in this cosmic matrix.
    * Every jewel represents an individual life form, atom, cell or unit
      of consciousness.
    * Each jewel, in turn, is intrinsically and intimately connected to
      all the others;
    * thus, a change in one gem is reflected in all the others.

This last aspect of the jeweled net is explored in a question/answer
dialog of teacher and student in the /Avatamsaka Sutra/. In answer to
the question: "how can all these jewels be considered one jewel?" it is
replied: "If you don't believe that one jewel...is all the jewels...just
put a dot on the jewel [in question]. When one jewel is dotted, there
are dots on all the jewels...Since there are dots on all the jewels...We
know that all the jewels are one jewel" ...".

The moral of Indra's net is that the compassionate and the constructive
interventions a person makes or does can produce a ripple effect of
beneficial action that will reverberate throughout the universe or until
it plays out. By the same token you cannot damage one strand of the web
without damaging the others or setting off a cascade effect of destruction.

Lucas,

  There are many people on this list who don't feel I bullied them.
  Unfortunately with the issues of China- and especially Lebanon and Palestine, I have been ferocious.

  In the case of the post response to Adeena Karasick pointing us out to a piece of video feauturing an Arab American pychologist blaming all the ills of the Arabs on Muslims and Arabs, well I guess you can call that the last straw.

  Well, whatever, I have no time for this. This list is populated by liberal Zionists, and I really have no time for that. So I am leaving, which I am sure will make some of you happy, like Lucas Klein.

  I will reiterate, if you had something personal with me- which was the case the first time you responded to me in the winter of 2005 (about how you were the China poetry expert and I was not), you should have done what human beings do and addressed me personally.

  You feel like somehow you are standing up for the people I offended on this list: BRAVO. The fact is I never ever described myslef as "someone who stands up for the downtrodden." If you see yourself that way it justr proves my point that you are exactly what I thought you were when I first came upon you: one gigantic pompous asshole.

  Right now what is on my mind is my people, that's all.
  I really did not want to offend anyone but there are some things that are unacceptable.

I know that the final answer is not one of either this
or that, but have witnessed some writers prefer this
over that. Too, there are those readers who are of the
same pattern of choice. Lots of useful responses have
been given in the past related to both and I'm hoping
that this question might further illuminate the issue
for me.

Much of my work, and I've only submitted for about two
years, has thusfar appeared in print, but then
sometime there's this feeling that online is where it
is at - sorta like MTV, one wonders, was a while ago -
and both print and online, as you know, seem to be in
competition. A tap dancer is how I often feel.

      I found the video of Dr. Wafa Sultan very intersting in the context of
the discussions of civilians and genocide of American Indians.  Dr.  Sultan
makes the classic opposition used against the Indians, and one used
frequently by Israeli spokespersons and leaders against the Palestinans.
This is the oppostion between civilization (in which there are civilians)
and what Sultan characterizies as people of "backwardness", who are
"primiitive" and act with "barbarity".
           Backwardness, primitive, barbarity--in short, "savages" wthout
such modern wonders as democracy and science (which she says is primarily
Jewish--usually used as a paranoid anti-semitic inditement, rather than a
wholesale elevation).  Acts of terror of course are carried out only by such
savages--never by the civilized.
           (The word barbarian comes from the Greek:  a person who did not
speak Greek sounded to Greek ears as though they were saying
"bar-bar-bah-bah-"etc--)
            Dr. Sultan invokes "rationality" in opposition to the
"barbarity" of the "primitive"'s "backwardness" of thinking.  And what has
n't been the great role of this rationality in rationalizing
the  rationalized systematic extermination of "savage" "backward"  peoples?
(The gas chambers and systems of trains, of collecting every valuable, of
making use of every part of the corpse, of using the near dead dead to tend
to the dead--one of the triumphs of rationality--) When Dr. Sultan invokes a
clash of eras, she is keeping alive and well many of the tropes of
colonialism. I have heard ad infniitum the rationale of settlers in the
Occupied Terrirtories, diverting the water, taking away the arable land,
with small outposts protected against reservation/refugee camps by extreme
force and the rationale is often that the people who have been here al this
time were backwards and didn't know how to make a State, or modern
scientific farms, etc.  etc.  In short, they are not "civilized" and thus
not "civilians" and so have no rights.  Therefore the land, water,
resources, can't possibly be claimed by them, and if they protest, being
savage, they are being "terrorists" and so the civilized thing to do is kill
them all by any means necessary.  Genocide is rationality, terrorism is
savagery--which of course is far worse, being backward, primitive, with no
regard for the life of civilians.  (Barbarians, savages, not being
civilians, are perfectly fine to slaugher whether men wormen or children,
armed or unarmed.)
       The "clash of eras" is a 19th century attitude--an almost blind
belief in "progress" via science and rationality and "democratic" reforms,
regime changes, regulations of all sorts imposed on the "backwards" to make
them tame animals capabale of providing the lowest forms of labor for their
civilized masters. One of the great monuments to this rationality  is the
wall the Israelis are having put up--here rationality comes to its logical
conclusion:  the wall is being built by Palestinian workers.
(Just as the Pharoahs used the captive Children of Israel in building the
Pyramids.)
      My point is, if you think Dr. Sultan is a voice of "reason"--a brave
outspoken "heretic"--think through what she is saying, what words she is
using.  When people who believe in progress talk about a clash of eras--what
they mean is that the new one must eradicate, eliminate, compeltely erase
and replace the old era.  The new era is "good" "moral" "democratic"
"civilized" "rational" "scientific"----as one can observe daily in its
actions in Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine.  There you can see al l the wonderful
things Dr. Sultan is invoking in action.
       Dr. Sultan speaks of a 21st century era and thinking--yet what she is
caught up in is the 19th century.  For a twenty-first century peace to be
possible, what is being thought in the twenty-first century can't be
ignored, denied, refused as being part of the 21st century. (I.E.  a
'Backwards" thought thought now--is being thought NOW--by a living
person--persons who  are not symbolically dead people or have no living
rights because their thought is not "up to date".)   At least begin with an
encounter and dialogue in which each understands that the other is equally
present and thinking in this moment of the present.  If one followed Dr.
Sultan's ideas, and it has been done many many times--one wd have a new
genocide based on eliminating those who don't "belong" in the 21st Century.
(I actually heard an Israeli Minister say this of the Palestinians--they
don't belong here anyway as have never developed anything, not even a
history as a "people", and so aren't part of the modern world.  Pol Pot had
very definite ideas also about who belonged in the time he wanted to create
as the time of the new  soceity.)
       "Language is one of the first casualities of war"--along with "look
before you leap" one needs to "listen before you leap"--

I don't think of print and online as being competition, although I guess a
lot of people do. These days I try to get published online more than in
print because online zines match print zines for quality, have more readers
and save money on postage. The rises in postage rates over the years have
taught me that if I spend nearly two dollars on a submission's round trip
postage and I have to submit it thirty times before I find a publisher, I
can issue a broadside or a small chapbook for the same amount. My internet
fee covers the cost of submitting to online zines. I still value print
zines, but prefer online's two-day wait time to a print zine's three-month
wait. I do prefer to read books than printouts, so I'm glad to see that some
online zines have begun to offer print versions. Each venue has it virtues
and I don't make hard and fat rules about where I submit my work---except,
as often as possible, to send work to people who really want it.  Hope this
helps.

Well, I'm sure nothing I'm about to say is new, but for my part, the best journals, of course, are print publications with web links--I love those! And why choose? My sense (and others on this list will know better than I) is that print journals such as New American Writing, Conjunctions, Verse, etc., etc. still hold more prestige, but that online journals sometimes have far larger readerships (though I'm not sure how exactly true this is; they certainly have the means to more easily distribute to a larger readership, but to what extent and by what advertising means that potential is or isn't fulfilled, I have no idea, although I think the main way is through links to/from other sites). I think journals like Free Verse, GutCult, Octopus, Typo, and Word For/Word (to name only a few) are "where it's at" in terms of publishing a lot of amazing writing by less established writers. I definitely have the sense that most (and often, all) of any journal's print pages are reserved
 for the well-booked.

I, personally, have had great experiences with both. The only bad experience I've had, as an aside, was with one of the more established print journals in which I've published. They told me I should be "content, and even grateful" to have my work in their journal, even in "altered" form. The egotism! "Altered" feels euphemistic, although my usual "butchered" is perhaps melodramatic. They only compounded the situation by not publishing the poem on their website in its true form, as promised, for over 9 months (and even then...). I don't see online journals (or digital writing) supplanting "old fashioned" print journals/books--ever. I think the whole "digital revolution" in some ways is amazing and in others it is the revolution that is not one. I think--I certainly hope--that they will happily and peacefully co-exist in the world without U.S. military support/intervention.

As far as the virtues I see in each, I'm a bit of a book fetishist and LOVE holding a book in my hands, carrying it around with me, flipping through the pages, etc. I miss that particular corporeal aspect  in my online publications. Those, however, are more financially able to publish my work, the majority of which consists in longer poems/poem sequences that print publications don't have the space for (or won't make the space for--Michael Tod Who??). Can I  hear a "Yet"? Somebody?? Anybody....

actually i just got in the mail my print version of otoliths number 1 and i must say i really like the print verion better – but in terms of speed and timing online is better

  with my zine i print evey 3 months and but i get most of my submission by e-mail now and i am genreral able to responde with in a day or two (fhole # 9will be shipped out to contributor next week)

i really do like flipping the pages of paper much  more than moving around a site..

lot of people do. These days I try to get published online more than in
print because online zines match print zines for quality, have more readers
and save money on postage. The rises in postage rates over the years have
taught me that if I spend nearly two dollars on a submission's round trip
postage and I have to submit it thirty times before I find a publisher, I
can issue a broadside or a small chapbook for the same amount. My internet
fee covers the cost of submitting to online zines. I still value print
zines, but prefer online's two-day wait time to a print zine's three-month
wait. I do prefer to read books than printouts, so I'm glad to see that some
online zines have begun to offer print versions. Each venue has it virtues
and I don't make hard and fat rules about where I submit my work---except,
as often as possible, to send work to people who really want it. Hope this
helps.

live my life by it, which is why the blase distance of relativity is so

PERSISTENCIA is proud to present *Plain Speak/Sweet
Speak<http://www.freewebs.com/persistenciapress/gerpp_psss.pdf>
*, a dynamic collaboration between G Emil Reutter and Phil Primeau. The
double chap of "plain sweet poetry" consists of two parts: the base text and
the "remixed" text.

From the Editor's Intro:

*This chapbook demonstrates not only the versatility of language, but also
the necessity of subtextual examination. It allows reflection on cultural
and linguistic patterns and forces the reader to consider the flexibility of
the written unit. To the regret of elementary school grammar teachers
everywhere, a piece of literature is not a sandwich. It is not a discreet
continuum with a beginning, middle, and end. Rather, it is an onion. It is a
rug of thickly woven thematic and narrative elements.

I've been submitting almost totally to online journals for the past year and a half and find it much less troublesome than sending to print journals through the mail.  Generally the wait, both for decision and publication, is much less with online zines.  This is the main seductive factor behind my switch, after thirt years of publishing in print journals.  Still, as some of the print journals I submitted to over two years ago have recently, at long last, found their way into my mailbox, I am reminded of the joy of holding the work in my hands, the joy of personal possession of a physical object, which online does not provide.  So I suspect that at some time, I will start the SASE grind with print magazines again.  Regards, Tom Savage

================================================================

Poet, essayist, editor, and long-time resident of San Francisco, Stephen
Vincent was founder, publisher, and editor of Momo's Press and Shocks
magazine in the nineteen-seventies. During the eighties and early
nineties, he was the founding Director of Bedford Arts, Publishers,
which became an internationally renowned publisher of art books.

Stephen Vincent's most recent books of poetry include Walking (Junction
Press), A Walk Toward Spicer (Cherry On the Top Press), and two ebooks,
Sleeping With Sappho (http://www.fauxpress.com/e/vincent/), and Triggers
(http://www.shearsman.com/pages/books/ebooks/ebooks_home.html). Walking
Theory is scheduled for publication in 2007.

Vincent maintains a popular blog of new poetry, art, and political
commentary, occasionally including photos
(http://stephenvincent.net/blog), and has recently returned from a
reading tour that included the Soundeye Poetry Festival in Cork,
Ireland, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland.



David Abel has the most extraordinary air of self-satisfaction. Yet, if
we stop to examine those Chinese writings of his that he so
presumptuously scatters about the place, we find that they are full of
imperfections. Someone who makes such an effort to be different from
others is bound to fall in people's esteem, and I can only think that
his future will be a hard one. He is a gifted man, to be sure. Yet, if
one gives free rein to one's emotions even under the most inappropriate
circumstances, if one has to sample each interesting thing that comes
along, people are bound to regard one as frivolous. And how can things
turn out well for such a man?  (Diary of Murasaki Shikibu)

================================================================

from Triggers:

Ascend and dive
and don't tell me a thing
I've got a good love on the loose

A wet madrone, skin pealing, its bone bare trunk

Never stop for thought,
especially when the going's good

She's inside me, then out,
tactile as a banana or something to munch
Spasms spring tender illuminations
mauve and pink -

I am a young man now and a young man then:
Live live live.

     -- Stephen Vincent

At my age, I have to limit my time at the computer (back problems) and since
I write all my prose on the computer, and keep up with most of my
correspondence there (both hard-copy MAILED letters and e-mail), I hardly
ever got to the screen to do any reading for pleasure or to explore poetry.

A book will accompany me to bed, or the lounge chair; I can read it on a bus
or train. As well as being often a beautiful object in itself.

Oh, and did I mention my eyes don't like the computer screen? Anything
longer than a page, I print out to read.

I find converting 'text docs' into PDFs - including my own - much more
pleasing than, say, reading this text.  Most On-line mags are done in PDF -
which can make them much pleasing to read (tho the factor of poor design can
even screw that up).

But, I agree, Diane, the portability of a book - especially if its on good
stock, well printed, comfortably bound, etc. - is a pleasure. On the other
hand, I am sure it's no issue with young people - who are probably now born
with electronic devices that are immediately attached to their bodies - to
take all-in-on multiple task cell phone, text message devices, cameras,
audio recorders, dvd players and digital book readers on to the bus, for a
walk in the park, on the street, etc., etc!

As for me, when I go out for a walk nowadays, I carry
no laptop, no cell phone (never owned one), no books.
A camera? Yes . . . sometimes.

Sometimes, however, I carry a book or a laptop from a

I personally never send things to any journal that requires hardcopy submissions sent through the mail. it's dumb and takes too much time. that makes more of a difference to me than whether the rag is published electronically or in paper. I just hate printing out copies of poems, sticking them in envelopes, writing out my address on the SASE, putting it in the mailbox, all of that shit. it sucks and i refuse to do it. luckily there are some very cool places like Fence and blazeVOX that take online submissions, and that means that they get a better shot at my poetry. which is good for them, because i'm great.

Diane DiPrima's response sort of tempted me to include an excerpt from an
interview that was published in an Indian journal in 2004. Sabyasachi
Sanyal, a Stockholm based, young Bengali language poet, interviewed me about
Kaurab Online(www.kaurab.com) , the online version of a veteran Bengali
alternative literary magazine (focusses largely on poetry) I edit.

I started editing this online magazine in 1997 when I lived in LA. The
purpose then, was a desperate bid to stay connected with my Indian poet
friends who edited the print mag. It was a strange call at that hour.
"Webzine" was new and nebulous notion; trying to accomplish that in Bengali
script was another huge challenge. However, we did our most trying to reap
our best seeds on unknown soil. The first Indian online poetry magazine was
thus born. Probably pre-nupital and pre-mature. I say "pre-mature", as this
was only the second website in an Indian language script in world wide web.

An alternative literary journal born way before the leading dailies - it was
probably a foolish effort on my part to bring in the automobile way before
the bullock-cart.

But it paid off. The excerpt is below -

Aryanil Mukherjee

___________________________________________________________________________


SS : You have said before that you see "ages separating an online magazine
from a print magazine" - please explain. What are the real differences, pros
& cons etc. ?

AM: A book/magazine goes to the press to die. I view every book release
event as a funeral. Let me explain. The book is a "pierre-ecrite" at that
point. A thing of the past. Nothing is going to change in there. Nothing is
going to change it until a new edition comes out. Even a typo is going to
remain a "typo"; might even be elevated to a angelic note or relegated to a
whimp. I always wanted to ask a poet, why he/she never considered
changing/rewriting a published poem. An online magazine/e-book at least
tempts us with such an opportunity.

Let me simplify. Pointwise.

1. A printed magazine issue can never be changed for good or bad. An online
mag issue could be continuously renewed, if you wish. I could present you
some very practical situations here. Let's say, you did a special online
issue on contemporary Turkish poetry today. Three years later down the road
you come across a very important poet whom you missed out during your maiden
voyage. You could post-process history, add him to that archived issue. You
can fix your past. Don't need to be Harry Potter.

2. We all understand the advantages involved with circulation. Especially in
developing countries like India, where vernacular literature lacks proper
infrastructure and archival mechanisms, where library science is in a pretty
primitive state, an online mag brings a lot more hope to
experimental/alternative literary efforts.

It is like visiting a graveyard in a poor town. Look for the dead flowers,
look for moss on the tombstones. You could tell the town's present from
those pictures.

Kaurab Online presents a very practical example where online existence has
even helped alternative literature outlive some gross populistic work
(because they didn't have websites).

3. In most cases, you need to buy the print magazine. You don't buy a lot of
online magazines. You don't need to. For less than a quarter of the printing
cost you could run an online magazine, 12 issues a year, hopefully with a
larger audience. And remember, with a world-wide readership. I believe
alternative literature needs to look beyond the local coffee-pub environ and
its cultural climate. There is always a different reader, with a different
viewpoint at a different place. And there are more lovers of alternative
literature elsewhere than you can think. With a print mag, we could not even
dream of reaching that "elsewhere". Now we can at least dream. Once again I
have to add here, Kaurab opened my eyes. Back in 1997-98, when I started the
online webzine, I couldn't have possibly dreamed that, more than 80% of its
current readership, which is in the thousands, came from outside Bengal.

It also created more opportunity for the print issue. The print-issue went
globe-trotting and by the way, only about 100-200 printed copies sell in
Calcutta.

It is really....really....hard for me to believe these numbers and the
disparity between them.

4. Next, the archival issue. Have I seen the first issue (1969) of Kaurab ?
No. I don't think I'll ever see that. Out of the 100 issues we have printed
in the last 34 years, we have very few left in print. It is history a bit
too soon.
That's almost always the case with little magazines anywhere on this planet.
But, Kaurab wasn't all that little. Yet......

And twenty years from now you'll still be able to find the first online
issue from 1997; anyday, anytime, from anytown. For someone like me, who was
born in the 60s, didn't see computers in high-school, it's arouses a thrill
everytime I think about it.

5. And suppose we were still left with a few copies of all of our 100
printed issues, in a growing human jungle like India, where would you find
a place to store them ? How much do you have to pay for its conservation ?

The few gigabytes of cyberspace (when mapped to real 3D space, may not seem
bigger than tiniest piece of nail your nail-cutter could slice) seems to
offer a "gun-to-kill-a-fly" solution.

6. Here is another example, once again, from real life. I know an American
Magazine that recently altered fonts in all of their online issues from the
past 3 years. Was that ever an option with print mags ?

7. Don't just think of fonts, backgrounds, colors and links. An online
magazine is a multimedia experience unlike a print mag. It provides you a
space where a painter or an animator could converse much better with a
writer/poet. In some of the early issues of Kaurab Online, we have even
tried to use animation art to illustrate poems. I'm not claiming that we
achieved something huge.....

SS : Could you give us some examples ?

AM : Sure. Like with Kamal Chakraborty's 1970 poem - "Raining in Jamshedpur"
we used an animated gif of a lighting image on the background of the poem. I
have seen a French webzine showing animated pixel-art with Appolinaire's
poem - Rain. These are artistic opportunities that came into being with this
media itself.

SS : Visual clues ?....Isn't that....

AM : Sure, you could argue if it is a wise thing to include "visual clues"
or visual support with poetry. I don't want to get into a philosophical
argument on that; I'm just trying to point out that the cyber media and
eventually online mags, present us with umpteen opportunities where strange
fields of arts could engage in the strangest possible ways.

Interesting. I on the other hand, never submit anything electronically. I
don't trust the thing to arrive as I wrote it: line breaks, spacing, etc.
tend to get changed in the process of getting from here to there. If there's
a mag that really wants online submission, I back it up with hard copy & ask
them to check what they get online against what it looks like on the actual
page(s) I'm mailing.

Just a product of my time, I guess.    Diane

No, I don't think it's generational; at 34 I'm just as concerned about form. I absolutely do not submit to mags that refuse to accept attachments, but only accept work pasted into the body of an email (!) -- a recipe for sure disaster. In fact, I think it's careless disregard for the work that allows such narrow guidelines for email submissions. Spacing and breaks are as much a part of the poem as the words themselves for me; not all poets/editors seem to fully understand the importance of spacing to a poem. For me, every tab, every margin, every touch of the enter key or space bar is the growth of bone. I don't trust chiropractors or rolfers.

Interesting. I on the other hand, never submit anything electronically. I
don't trust the thing to arrive as I wrote it: line breaks, spacing, etc.
tend to get changed in the process of getting from here to there. If there's
a mag that really wants online submission, I back it up with hard copy & ask
them to check what they get online against what it looks like on the actual
page(s) I'm mailing.

Just a product of my time, I guess.    Diane

For me, the line for "ancient history" is 1990.  In my family ancient history
is last week, and we are always in at least a minor feud over it.  To them,
it is ancient history that I went for a job interview to scrub floors in the
suburbs last week; my earned degrees, especially the one from '94, are part of
ancient history, etc.  In publishing, submissions went from single- to multi-
some time in the early 90s or late 80s; '92 seems another useful line for
measuring time in internet art space.  I still try to practice single submissions,
which is a throwback to pre-1990 ancient history, and I expect a return if I
send an SASE, which is to have ancient expectations.  In 1996, I went online.
I saw that many very talented E people had been there before me, laying
tracks, designing sites, building roads.  I saw that some of the literary sites had
the capacity to archive their back issues.  All of this had great appeal, even
though I'm not particularly electronic -- I am more text-based and not
otherwise very graphic.  Like some of the people have mentioned here, I like holding
a beautifully designed bound book and reading it from my purse or in bed.  My
computer is an "ancient" (though post-1990) model, and it sits frumpily on my
desk and is immovable and personal.  It has limited remaining capacities.  I
go to the internet to read quickly for information, and I like it for reading
short poems and short stories and essays.  Anything longer, I would like to
have it in book form, unless it is in fact art belonging to the internet.  But,
often, I don't like to read longer things, anyway.

My first published short story was in The Quarterly in 1988.  That was a pulp
paperback with a shiny cover that had a wider circulation than was usual for
literary journals, and it was also literary.  I used my usual method for
getting in: one story to one editor at one time via US mail with SASE.  Gordon Lish
responded a week later with an acceptance.  The stories (eventually I had
three there) came out about a year after acceptance.  He was considered to be
very efficient by the standards of that business.

Now I wait to be solicited.  It happens, but rarely.  If anyone writes or
calls with a request for something I wrote, I am sure to get something to them.
With this post-ancient-history method my "waiting" feels more patient -- I am
not waiting to hear back.  Using the old method, I currently have submissions
out to five publications -- and it's taking forever.  I have written queries
and reminders.  They are holding these publications sometimes for five years!
The old method has become lugubrious.

I try to send things as RTF attachments as much as possible since that's very good at preserving those kinds of things, and have the added benefit that they can't carry viruses and worms like DOC's, and allow some control over tabs and spacing if you use a fixed width font, and they are pretty much fool proof at preserving line breaks. I agree with the other poster, though, that I'm highly skeptical of any place that wants you to paste your submission into the body of an email.

I hate mailing things though. It takes so long. It's so formal. It requires paper and then, if you have the wrong address, it might be a week before you find out your submission never got anywhere. I gave up trying to do it a couple of years ago after my third hard copy submission to Arsenic Lobster got RTS'd from whoever it was that was the editor in the most recent version of writer's market but who evidently wasn't the editor anymore, and this after the first was lost and the second was RTS'd from the person listed as the editor on the website. It was wholly irritating and i decided then and there that any magazine that didn't have the wherewithal to get it together enough to take electronic submissions a.) wasn't worth my time to submit to and b.) wasn't going to get any money from me either. Which is to say, if print journals insist on paper submissions, I don't read them either.

the 'online journals vs print' binary is less relevant to my work. i do
publish things in print occassionally, but mostly my pubs are digital.
sometimes in online journals, sometimes in other forms. sometimes in gallery
installations. sometimes at turbulence.org which i guess you could call an
online journal but it's a net art site. i appreciate online literary
journals that also publish literary net art. i do think of what i do mainly
as writing.

i also publish more or less all my work on my own site. datsa my boook. and,
looking at my web logs, i find that most of the visitors come from google,
stumbleupon, and other 'unlikely' places. really a very unlikely place that
has posted a link to my piece arteroids yesterday is a site named
i-am-bored.com . i noticed this site this morning in my web logs because
there are about 4000 hits since they linked to arteroids yesterday. and all
sorts of comments from, um, mostly bored teenagers i guess, such as
"Wha??????????????????????????????????" and "...Just
back...away...slowly..." and
"ok.....this....is..weird........maby..,if..,we..,stand,perfectly....still..
..it'll...,pass...........right passed us". lots of kids in the 13-17
year-old range.

the audience for poetry is very broad and odd. in print. online. offline in
galleries. holzer-fashion on marquees and other signage. poetry is expanding
big bangish.

Lucas,
There is no virtue in criticism. =20

However, why should there be?

Isn't a critic really just a person with a different point of view who =
had the temerity to express that difference? =20

Mind you, this doesn't make the critic any more or less right, honorable =
or sanctimonious than the creator whom he or she has criticized. =20

In the simple truths of life, the fact is the critic may be the one in =
error...unfortunately, after a criticism has been levied, facts too =
often get mired in the alignment of taking sides.  And when that =
happens, the numbers usually win.  The person with the most =
friends/associates triumphs, even if that point of view is in error.=20

When that happens, the facts get muddled, the details disappear amidst =
the pro and con comments, and for the most part, nothing gets resolved.  =


Neither you nor Paul have settled anything. =20
Alex=20

i was thinking too of leaving group but because it helps me get published
etc  i stick it out

paul back channeled me a very nasty threatening e mail  when he thought
almost paranoid that i was against him his family and lebanon
almost severe anti-steve as well as anti-semetic i felt
whaen what i dis in my own stubborn and stupid way
was to tell folks we cannot take sides
innocents get killed ohn both ends both ends are wrong

hezzbollah  shoots 100's of rockets per day
they don't kill less civilians because they don't try to ( my idea
anyway)
but because they have fasr less superior equipment
they're both wrong
and innocents on both sides suffer as does the world at large
as joe and others said hostory is omportant
but history hasn't over all taught the war mongers  much
tho of course it's taught them something
otherwise after ww2  we'd all be blown to hell by now
this is a crazy jihad
we kill the father only to become
i don't think even paul tho as i pointed out to afriend who is leaning
more toward
hezbollah's side
wants to see a muslim fundamentalist dominated worlsd or middle east
it's very difficult
muslims and christians as far as history goes
should never forget what the root religion they came from is
and respect that and work out a solution
not based on hate politics or greed but on humanity respect and likeness
not differences  but of course this is a fantasy of mine
a talmudic question  of what is the sound of 2 dogs barking
/
hey did you guys hear that  eiger mt is collapsing?

It is very interesting you use the contemporary Turkish poetry as an example.
In "Eda: an Anthology of Contemporary Turkish Poetry," published in 2004, I
included an essay, called "A Godless Sufism: Ideas on the Rwentieth Century
Turkish Poetry." This essay was written in around 1995 and discusses how the
poets of that time confronted the problem that Istanbul had grown from a city of
one million (in the 1950's) to a city of twelve million. The previous poetic
movement in Turkish poetry, "The Second New," was built around the psychic
geography of the one million city. Poets who were writing in the style of The
Second New were writing about a place which did not exist.

More than one third of the poetry in Eda is written in the 1990's. These
fantastic poems have some common characteristics which I call "the poetry of
motion," a startling development which reflects Istanbul as a more than twelve
million global city. None of the poets in question was referred to in my "godless
sufism essay"; I did not know them at the time they were writing and
publishing their new work in Turkey.

When I decided to include the essay in the Eda anthology, I decided to change
nothing in it, Both my ignorance of them at the moment and the kind of
questions I raise, which the poetry of motion answers, is part of the historical
record.

I avoid to rewrite history.

Ciao,

Murat

i will be in the area from august 10th to the 15th. i've never been before. in this intense, emotionally crowded nyc summer, with will-zapping heatwaves and heartbreaking international news, i've been feeling a bit like "this is it"--this weather and this warfare is all there ever will be. but in actuality, the most recent heatwave has broken, and i am scheduled to board a plane to denver for a family event. so--anyone there have any events, etc., they'd like to recommend?

sounds like my hypothetical example turned out to be much telepathic.
well, I didn't suggest rewriting history, but post-process it to fix obvious
unforced errors, fill in gaps that we left behind unknowingly and thus keep
the past wobbling all the time, which gives us a sense that IT IS THERE,
ALIVE, but in the end, IT IS PAST.

I'm genuinely interested in contemporary Turkish poetry and your article.
Maybe we could discuss it offline.

Hi,
I'm seeking help from Barthes scholars or archivists on the list to try to
obtain a copy of a letter I  received from him in the late 70's -  80's.  I
loved the Mythologies, but when Plaisir du Texte  came out, I wrote him a
gin-soaked letter explaining that he was now  frivolous and bourgeois. I received a
reply, reconstructed partially  here; my French is rusty, so any errors are
mine, obviously, and not  Barthes's;

"Je ne connais pas assez d'anglais [to determine] le degre de votre
agressivite

 [missing text]

A ce que je sais de moi, j'ecris pour etre aime de loin; en votre cas,  c'est
rate.

N'importe
Roland Barthes

I kept meaning to write back and recant; rereading the work, I wanted to
tell him how much I admired it and all the body of his work. Of course, he got
hit by a laundry truck before I ever got around to doing it.

I no longer have this letter but would dearly love a copy. Would  anyone know
where and how to begin a search for a copy of it, if it  exists?

Thanks,
Larissa Shmailo

That sort of puts you in the position of an embezzler criticizing

Only if one is a narrow, 'black & white' thinker...e.g. there is only =
that which is good (virtuous) and that which is evil (lacking in =
virtue), and the good and the evil are set by their personal definitions =
of the terms.=20

Others may hold to a slightly broader view, open to the realm of =
possibilities which include even the remote possibility that they =
themselves may be wrong (virtue-less) in any given circumstance.=20

Nor does being open to the possibility of lacking in virtue lead to the =
illogical conclusion, as you suggest, that one is a felon.  The =
difference of course being in doing that which is illegal as contrasted =
from doing that which is wrong.  Though I also concede there are some =
who find all acts of wrong to be illegal; I know a few such folks who =
attend a local church I avoid.  =20

Virtue:   The quality or act of doing that which is right and avoiding =
that which is wrong. "She lives a life of virtue, avoiding all sins of =
the flesh."=20

Criticism: Disapproval expressed by pointing out what is wrong with the =
work or thoughts of another. =20

Perhaps, and of course, this is merely a virtue-less opinion, Lucas =
fails to see the virtue in Paul's screaming simply because Lucas has =
already closed his mind to the possibility of truths inherent in the =
thoughts of others.

Just a whopping thanks to all. Wonderful, wonderful
responses. This kind of information certainly helps to
give me a better perspective on submitting work. Too,
I hope it might help others.

Dear All,

This week at Vacation House we move from the ridiculously sublime to
the sublimely ridiculous with two poet/cartoonist/provocateurs who
will no doubt make you laugh and/or piss you off. Is the demure
McNally Robinson books ready for the onslaught of these two
polymath
iconoclasts. Come and find out.


JIM BEHRLE's *She's My Best Friend* is due out from Pressed Wafer in
the Fall.He is widely rumored to be a member of the shadowy
editorial order of the online magazine can we have our ball back?
And his various on-line shenanigans can be found all over the
internet.

Poet and cartoonist GARY SULLIVAN is the author of *How to Proceed
in the Arts* and, with Nada Gordon, *Swoon*. He has published two
issues of his comic book, *Elsewhere*, and is currently working on
a book of translations of poetry by Ernst Herbeck.


In other news: I am hosting a benefit reading/concert marking the
one year anniversary of hurricane Katrina over at the Bowery Poetry
Club. So save the date, 26 August 2006, from 7pm-11pm. It will
feature the poetic stylings of PROFESSOR ARTURO, SAPPHIRE, JOHN
GIORNO, ED SANDERS, EDWIN TORRES, GREG FUCHS, MARCELLA DURRAND,
NATHANIEL SIEGEL,TONYA FOSTER, and MICHAEL FORD, along with food,
music from New Orleans. Good time/good cause.

also, in the same vein--the great New Orleans poet and saloon keeper
Dave Brinks will be reading at the Bowery Poetry Club on Wednesday
the 9th, at 8pm. So go see him [after you see Jim and Gary--make it
a double feature] and get the real scoop on the health and
well-being of the Big Easy.

On TN this week -

Not Like Beckett by Michael Watts, directed by Michael Kantor.  Beckett @The
Malthouse Theatre until August 20.

It's hard to know how to describe Not Like Beckett. Should I take a cue from
the title and do some negative theology, attempting to describe it by
listing all the things it is not? As it says on the box, it is not at all
like Beckett. It isn't like Ibsen or Chekhov or Miller, either.

However, it is, in a particular and very recognisable way, extremely
Australian. The iconic Yellow Peril that dominates the set is only the most
obvious signal that this is a work about us, from us and for us. But there
is nothing earnest - and not a shred of the provincial - in this anarchic,
rambunctious and liberatingly offensive piece of theatre.

Not Like Beckett embodies many of the things that I love about Australian
culture: its irreverence, energy, intelligence, fearlessness and wit. There
is no contradiction in the fact that it highlights our good points by
exposing our bad: here, written large, is our racism, the apathy that segues
into cruelty, the tinpot triumphalism of colonialisation, the sexual
viciousness. But it's in all in the name of good, filthy fun.

China Tightening Control Over Tibet
Even Amid Talks, Party Moves to Curb Influence of
Dalai Lama

By Maureen Fan
Washington Post Foreign Service
Saturday, August 5, 2006; Page A16

BEIJING, Aug. 4 -- China's Communist Party has been
tightening its grip on Tibet in recent months,
resorting to language and measures not seen since the
repression of the late 1990s, according to sources
with knowledge of the situation.

The pressure comes as the Dalai Lama's envoys continue
to negotiate with Beijing about his possible return to
Tibet after more than 40 years in exile. The religious
leader is regarded by the Chinese as bent on
independence for the region, and his followers are
seen as subversives.

"In the last few weeks, we have seen an increasingly
repressive political climate on Tibet as Beijing
emphasizes its domination of the region," said Kate
Saunders, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based
International Campaign for Tibet. "It's difficult to
discern the intentions of the senior leadership on the
ongoing dialogue between the Dalai Lama's
representatives and Beijing."

Nongovernmental organizations in Tibet say they have
started to feel the pressure. Some contracts to work
in the region reportedly have not been renewed. Last
month, a study program between American universities
and Tibet University was closed in the city of Lhasa
after 20 students arrived and were turned away,
sources said on condition of anonymity. The official
reason for the closure was that the teachers were too
busy.

Also last month, authorities shut down the blogs of a
well-known Tibetan writer who posted a photograph of
the Dalai Lama and wished him a happy birthday, his
71st.

Some Tibet observers say the timing of the tightening
could be a sign that various factions in the Communist
Party are engaged in a power struggle, with
hard-liners opposed to any deal that would bring the
religious leader back from his exile in Dharamsala,
India. But others argue that Chinese leaders have
several cards and are playing them simultaneously,
essentially negotiating on Tibet while still cracking
down on the Dalai Lama's followers, said Robbie
Barnett, professor of modern Tibetan studies at
Columbia University.

"Perhaps this is to wear down the Dalai Lama and
threaten his power base," Barnett said.

A story run in two Chinese newspapers and carried by
the official New China News Agency asserted late last
month that, while the Dalai Lama has told the world he
seeks autonomy or a "middle way" rather than
independence, he is not to be believed. "Given the
fact that the Dalai Lama gives out different signals
at different times and even at the same time, one can
hardly agree his 'middle way' is different from
'Tibetan independence,' " the article said.

The Chinese government has moved to block any
influence the Dalai Lama has over Tibetans. Earlier
this year, after the religious leader made a plea to
protect endangered species and his followers began
destroying their fur-lined traditional robes, the
Chinese government banned Tibetans from burning fur
pelts. Then, after monks clashed in a dispute over
clay statues of an obscure deity at a monastery near
Lhasa, the city's mayor accused the Dalai Lama of
stirring up trouble and trying to "sabotage the unity
of Tibet."

There have long been cycles of repression and
relaxation in Chinese policy toward Tibet. The
previous two party secretaries in the region were
considered technocrats who were more focused on
economic development, observers said.

But the current secretary, Zhang Qingli, who once
served in the Communist Youth League with President Hu
Jintao, has a strong record of making ideological
statements against separatism. A former commander of
the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps, Zhang had been charged with border security and
presiding over the migration of millions of Han
Chinese to Xinjiang.

An informed source in Lhasa who spoke on condition of
anonymity said thousands of government workers in
Phenpo, a rural area just northeast of Lhasa, had been
asked to write criticisms of the Dalai Lama. Similar
campaigns have targeted monasteries in the past, but
the source said it was unusual to involve civil
servants.

After being named to the post in May, Zhang had
quickly declared a stepping-up of the Communist
Party's patriotic education campaign in Tibet, beyond
monasteries and nunneries to the wider population. He
said it was a "fight-to- the-death struggle" with the
Dalai Lama, who was "the biggest obstacle hindering
Tibetan Buddhism from establishing normal order,"
according to state media reports.

Said Saunders, of the International Campaign for
Tibet: "It was almost Cultural Revolution language."

A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry did not return a
call seeking comment.

  Sure, and that's the position I'm suggesting I hold in this instance,=20
  since it was you who made the black and white claim. Try to keep up.

  Actually, you haven't taken a position!=20

  All you've done is take cheap shots at the person, ignoring the point =

you made that takes a position.  I'd be happy to re-read them.  After =

  There is certainly a possible difference, between illegal and wrong,=20
  but the reason that things are illegal is that a large part of a=20
  society considers those things to be wrong. There are of course=20
  exceptions, and reasons to campaign to change the laws to reflect new=20

  This is my favorite of your weasel words...in fact I've copied this =
message and pasted it on my toilet paper which here to for I'd labeled =

to squirm out of your fuck ups:  "There is certainly a possible =
difference between illegal and wrong..."  Damn, I'm sure glad I didn't =
say that and you did!  This may be the reason why lawyers have a bad =
reputation...they too weasel like this. =20

  There are two kinds of criticism: normative and critical. Normative=20
  criticism is, roughly, judgment about whether something is right or=20
  wrong withing the norms of the society; critical criticism is=20
  judgment, roughly. about whether the norms of society reflect the=20
  attitudes of society accurately.
  I have a word for this equally weasel nonsense: horseshit! =20

  Are you drinking when you write this stuff, or are you on drugs?  Pay =
attention to this, I'll use caps to help you see the differences: =
OPINION IS OPINION!  YOU CAN CALL IT JUDGEMENT OR YOU CAN CALL IT =
ANYTHING ELSE, IT IS STILL OPINION.  And, since it is opinion, I repeat: =
There is no virtue in criticism. =20

  You seem to be thinking that whether something is virtuous or not is=20
  a matter of critical judgment, while thinking that whether something=20
  is legal or not is a matter of normative judgment. If I understand=20
  you correctly, then, what you're claiming is that your critical=20
  judgment is worthless because you're self-described as too cynical=20
  and opinionated to have such judgment. You may still be claiming to=20
  be able to tell whether something is legal or not (normative=20
  judgment), but you've abandoned all claims to critical judgment, or=20
  judgment of virtue.
  Marcus, what the hell is this nonsense? =20

  My statement was simple, I'll repeat it: There is no virtue in =
criticism.  That statement neither castigates another thinker, nor does =
it require a 600 word excuse for the fuck-up in your earlier comments.  =
Fact: criticism is opinion, ergo, I repeat: there is no virtue in =
opinion (criticism).  If in fact you lack the intellect to differentiate =
between fact and opinion, I'm sorry, I really can't help you on this =
point. =20

  Lucas seemed to me to be distinguishing between the substance of the=20
  issues and the manner of presentation -- and in this I agree with=20
  him. Name-calling and ad hominem attacks are deservedly relegated to=20
  the category of fallaciousness. To urge people to stick to the point=20
  and argue the issues on their merits, and refrain from personal and=20
  ad hominem attacks, seems less like a closing of Lucas's mind to the=20
  possibility of there being merit to Paul's position than like a=20
  reasonable demand that the discussion be carried out at a reasonable=20
  pitch and pace.=20

  How generous of you to share with us your opinion here, finally!!!! =20

  But too, you also miss the point of Lucas's attack.  I suggest you =
return to it, for in point of truth, Lucas in his comments, as do you in =
yours to me, attempt more to attack the person than to argue the point.  =

  I suspect both you and Lucas will continue to miss the point of the =
Paul's of the mid-east...you've already made up your minds they are the =
ranting and the illogical.  In point of truth, they may be the only =
remaining sane ones among us in that mess.  I say let's pay some =
attention to the screamers.  They may be trying to tell us =
something...even if it is something we really don't want to hear.=20

  And this, Marcus, was my point to Lucas. He moved the solution bar not =
one degree closer to resolution.  In fact, he may have moved matters =
several degrees further from resolution. =20

  If there is a non-violent solution to the mess we currently have in =
the Mid-East, that solution will not come from the rantings of different =
views, nor will it come from any of your comments, however well =
intentioned you may think you  are.=20

The claim "There is no virtue in criticism" is a criticism.
If the claim is the true, the claim contradicts itself because if
there is no virtue in criticism, there is no virtue in the claim
itself.
If the claim is false, then there is virtue in the claim because the
claim is false.

Alex, if there can be no difference between what is wrong and what is
illegal, then there can be no difference between what is right and
what is legal -- which means that there can be no critical analysis
of the law and, thus, no way to change it. There must be a possible
difference between what is illegal and what is wrong so that there
can be a possible difference between what is right and what is legal
so that we can have a critical analysis of the law.

Once again, Alex, if you deny that there is ever any difference
between what is illegal and what is wrong, or between what is legal
and what is right, you cannot have a critical analysis of the law,
because you will have taken the position that the law is always
right.

This claim is just as easy to refute:

The claim "There is no virtue in opinion" is an opinion.
If the claim is the true, the claim contradicts itself because if
there is no virtue in opinion, there is no virtue in the claim
itself.
If the claim is false, then there is virtue in the claim because the
claim is false.

Lucas may or may not agree with Paul's opinions about what to do or
not do with regard to the Israelis and Palestinians -- but what Lucas
said about Paul's tone and manner was that Paul's name-calling and
personal attack ought to be avoided. You criticised Lucas's criticism
by saying there is no virtue in criticism, and I pointed out that
that is a contradiction, a fallacy. I'm not really sure why you're
trying to defend the contradiction, but then, I'm not really sure why
you'd want to make it in the first place.

I say the screamers are the problem -- they're the ones saying "Kill
the enemy!" and other various extremist things. It is the screamers,
the zealots, the true believers who are creating the problem, on both
sides, and who create the problems on both sides in almost all
circumstances. That's why I, and Lucas, too, I think, oppose personal
attacks and ad hominem arguments.

Here we may agree, if by "rantings" you mean what "the screamers" say
-- though if you do, you've got another contradiction on your hands,
since just above you said that you think that it may be "the
screamers" whose rants we should be listening to.

Speech you don=B4t like, if you=B4re going to be civil, requires speech
that defends your views and argues against the views of others
instead of wheeling out the rusty artillery of abuse.

The example of imperturbable civility in the face of barbarian rage
is emblematic, I think, of what civilization is all about, and is the
best way in cyberspace (and cyberspace started with the first human
writing, I think) to persuade others (though not often one=B4s enraged
opponent, admittedly) of the virtues of such civility in the first
place and the validity of one=B4s arguments in the second.

The problem with the notion of "more speech" in response to speech
one doesn=B4t like is not that it has been tried and found wanting, but
that it has been tried and found difficult. It is, therefore, often
abandoned in favor of the far easier demand to suppress the speech
one doesn=B4t like.

People should use civil speech to establish boundaries and
definitions and to compare boundaries and definitions. One of the
most fascinating things about the internet is that it invites people
into a forum to discuss things with people they wouldn=B4t meet, or
wouldn=B4t meet often, or if they met wouldn=B4t talk to, in the flesh.

Some people, confronted with opinions they don=B4t want to hear, and
forbidden either to call their opponents names or demand the
suppression of their opponents views, vote with their feet. That's
too bad, because running away from opposing views seems to me to be
counter-productive and, ultimately, self-defeating. What seems to me
to be productive and virtuous is, instead, trying to educating
oneself, one's interlocutors, and the uncommitted bystanders through
discussion that addresses the merits of the issues at hand without
resorting to personal attack.

I find it tough to believe that no one here has something to say about Jim Weil who is definitely one the most important American poetry publishers of the 1960's and 70's. While I might guess that from this list only Ed Foster, Jenny Penberthy and myself (& maybe David Kirschenbaum) have had direct contact with him (as others I know are not subscribed here), it seems important to mention his contribution as my work brought him to his publishing, not his poetry.

  Weil ran the Elizabeth Press from the early 1960's until 1982; during this period he published the first collections by Simon Perchik, Carroll Arnett, and John Taggart. Some of his other authors included Lorine Niedecker, Larry Eigner, Ted Enslin, Anselm Hollo, and John Perlman(whose first book he might also have published). From the early 60's to the late 70's he was the primary publisher of William Bronk, Cid Corman, Simon Perchik, John Perlman and Carroll Arnett. Life Supports by William Bronk, when re-issued by another press, won the National Book Award in 1982.

  For me his importance was what it lead me towards, reading _Which Hand Holds the Brother_ by Simon Perchik lead me to re-issuing all of his Elizabeth Books. Reading Larry Eigner's Elizabeth books led me toward reading a publication called L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E which had a feature about him, which in turn lead me to reading and eventually publishing Bob Grenier. My extensive work with editing Hands Collected The Books of Simon Perchik (which includes six books from Elizabeth Press) as well as a Collected of Carroll Arnett (which also includes six books from Elizabeth) and talks with Cid Corman about issuing a Selected (including probably a dozen of Elizabeth books, which was eventually released by New Directions)  are what brought me in contact with him.

  He also published 18 issues of Elizabeth between 1961 and 1971. Some of their better known authors were Diane Wakoski, Cid Corman, George Oppen, Ron Offen, Lewis Turco, Richard Crashaw, William Stafford, Simon Perchik, Felix Stefanile, David Ignatow, Carroll Arnett, Loring Williams, Anselm Hollo, Robert Creeley, John Taggart, George Bowering, Paul Blackburn as well as many others.

Does anyone by any chance have Alice Notley's email? Or know if she even does email? I have a snail mail address for her in Paris, but given that that would take a good month back and forth, I was hoping to expedite things with an email. (I'm hoping desperately that she will sponsor my Fulbright app.) Please backchannel, of cousrse.

Many thanks in advance!

Cheers,

Tod

BookMooch is a community for exchanging used books.

BookMooch lets you give away books you no longer need in exchange for
books you really want.

# Give & receive: Every time you give someone a book, you earn a
point and can get any book you want from anyone else at BookMooch.
Once you've read a book, you can keep it forever or put it back into
BookMooch for someone else, as you wish.

# No cost: there is no cost to join or use this web site: your only
cost is mailing your books to others.

# Points for entering books: you receive a tenth-of-a-point for every
book you type into our system, and one point each time you give a
book away. In order to keep receiving books, you need to give away at
least one book for every two you receive.

# Help charities: you can also give your points to charities we work
with, such as children's hospitals (so a sick kid can get a free book
delivered to their bed), Library fund, African literacy, or to us to
thank us for running this web site <grin>.

# World wide: BookMooch is not just for Americans. You can request
books from other countries, in other languages. You receive 2 points
when you send a book out of your country, to help compensate you for
the greater mailing cost. John Buckman, who runs BookMooch, lives
both in California and London, England, and was frustrated by the
vast number of books that were printed in just one country but not
any another, or only after several years. Translations into French,
German and other languages are planned, and we already work fine with
the various Amazon worldwide databases.

# Wishlist: you can keep a "book wish list" that will automatically
arrive to you when you have the points and/or the book becomes
available in our catalog. Others earn 2 points if they supply a book
on your wishlist, so everyone is highly motivated to help find books
others are looking for.

# All books: our goal is to make more use out of all books, to help
keep books from becoming unavailable. The worst thing that can happen
to a book is for no-one to be able to read it.

# Feedback score: each time you receive a book, you can leave
feedback with the sender, just like how eBay does it. If you keep
your feedback score up, people are most likely to help you out when
you ask for a book.

does anyone have, or can they point me to, a translation of the actual edict
made by goebbels (i assume) regarding degenerate art? or perhaps the text
from the catalog if they made one?

i'd appreciate it.

my own website: http://globalvoicesradio.org/temporarily.html

Let me know and thanks for your consideration.

Kevin:

The original catalog entire is reproduced in Stephnie Barron's excellent
book DEGENERATE ART  The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany along with
the floor plan of the exhibit and 150 reproductions and list of al the
artits etc.
     Actually itwas one of the first realblockbuster exhibits f the 20th
century, drawing 3 million people in its travels--ironically making the
degenarte art a huge hit and seen by far more poeple than the opfficially
apporved National Socialist Art.
     Another weird twist is that included in the exhibit to show the
degeneracy of the modern artists on dispaly were works from the famous
Prinzhorn collection of art by by the insane.  Prinzhorn's book BILDNEREI
DER GEISTESKRANKEN had had an immense impact on the work of Klee and many
other artists as well as the Surrealists and led in part to Dubuffet's
development of Art Brut collections and the beginnings of recognitions of
outsider art.  The Nazis reversed the direction by hanging the mentally ill
alongside those they had influenced to show not the artistic merit of the
insane but the insanity of the artists.       The Barron book also has
essays making connections between the Nazis' ideas on degeneracy in modern
art and contemporary ones of the time period (the book came out in 1991,
connected with huge exhibition in LA).

hi all:
I can't find out how to contact the french journal Poetique.  Are
there any French folks or folks living in Paris who have any idea how
to get in touch with them?  I need to find out the original German
source for a Karlheinz Stierle article they published in #32 (back in
1977).  Can't find an E-dress or even a mailing address, let alone a
phone #.
any help wd be appreciated.
thanks all --md

He did not spread any rumors about you.  Nor did I.  In fact, the  person who

came to me with their framework of suspicions and I told them NO WAY.   I
told them that I

A little advice dear Adam, JUST BECAUSE you think you're clever doesn't  mean
you are.

When you start that Ph.D. program next month you might want to consider
doing some
research before presenting your assumptions.  Assumptions will get  your

Dear Alex, Marcus, and others:



I step back into this conversation with a bit of trepidation, because I
don't want to come off as defensive. Nonetheless, I see things going on in
this conversation that are explicitly against the hopes I put to use when
criticizing Paul's obnoxious rant in the first place.



When Alex writes "Stop attacking me personally.  Address the statement.
Either refute it of not, but stick to the point." and then says to Marcus "I
sure as hell hope you aren't in a position of importance in our public
school or public university systems...if you are, you may well be the reason
the GOP is winning the war on education they are waging when they claim our
school system is in the toilet" He seems to me both to be sensitive to, and
then to be propagating, the very kind of nastiness and aggression I was
decrying in the first place. I think we'd all be better off if we tried to
avoid these kinds of personal attacks.



As poets and readers of poetry, I think we should all be pretty clear on the
difference, and yet interrelationship, between form and content. What you
say and how you say it interact with each other, and yet are not each other.
For the record, Alex, I am not closed to the possibility that Paul, or
anyone, is right. In fact, one of the things I wrote to Paul was, "Paul:
your behavior embarrasses me, because so often I want to agree with what you
say, and yet I am alienated and offended by how you say it." I cannot
reconcile my saying that with your assertion that I have "already made up
[my mind] they are the ranting and the illogical" or that I "attempt more to
attack the person than to argue the point." That's the exact opposite of
what I wanted to convey in the first place! My point, very simply, was that
Paul, and anyone who reverts to belligerence and insults, is doing the whole
argument a disservice. The impropriety of the form gets in the way of any
validity of the content. Until we can find an appropriate form to express
our content, we will suffer, I think, not only in literature but in life, as
well. I say this as someone who is working to address and redress this
problem within himself, not only within others.



To this I feel that I have to append a thought on the idea that there is no
virtue in criticism. Such an idea, Alex, seems completely unpalatable to me.
The question is, who is served by such a statement? I think the only people
served by such an aversion to criticism are the people in power, and I'm not
generally interested in adding to the power that they already have. I'm sure
you're not, either, even though I know nothing about you. If there is virtue
in anything, then there is virtue in criticism.



If there is not virtue in anything, though, then I think we're dealing with
a different conversation. One very far from whether belligerence is
appropriate in any discussion.

My blog has turned into a garbage pail.  I'm translating from lists to blog,
from blogs to blog, from blog to lists.  Intense anger and distress has been
directed at me, I think, by poor men who would rather attack people than deal
with their distress; their distress is understandable, but their hatred is not.
 I was running short stories at the blog, but I have had to interrupt that
progress and report on the foul disorders of Generation X.

komninos--an excellent point that you make, that the bombing of nagasaki an
act of terrorism--

                the bombing of Hiroshima is always presented as
"justified"--yet in the piece i sent two days ago (resent below), it ends
with Hiroshima being considered as using the civilian population as guinea
pigs in an experimentation for studying the effects of the atom bomb and its
radiations--
               I was discussing this with my mother on Hiroshima Day and she
told me of a biography of Oppenheimer in which previously unreleased US govt
documents were made available for the first time--and what they showed was
that three months before Hiroshima, the Japanese govt had made an offer of
complete surrender with only one condition--that they be allowed to keep
their judicial system--
     after witnessing the test nuclear explosions at los alamos, the
scientists of the Manhattan Project  had been so horrified by what they
realized the bomb would be capable of, they had approached the govt and
implored the project be abandoned--Germany, for whom it had been intended,
had surrendered, and Japan was on its final legs--the govt refused
aboslutely to put an end to the project and used every means possible to
convince the scientists to continue--since many were refugees from the hells
unleashed by Japan's allies, and Japan had created hells in China and
throughout the Pacific, the scientists were finally coninced they would be
saving lives by putting a quicker end to the war--what they weren't told was
that the the US had already been offered complete surrender by the
Japanese--and the Americans had refused--basically the decision had been
made to become the world's first atomic power and also to observe the
effects of an atom bomb on a large civilian population--a cold blooded
decision was made that had nothing to do with the reasons that have been put
forth for decades and which whether one agreed with them or not one had
taken as being true--
        200,000 people died in the immediate aftermaths of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, and tens of thousands more maimed and dying slowly from mutations
of known diseases and appearances of previously unknown ones, carried from
one generation to the next--the largest cruelest coldest most calculated
experimentation yet done on human beings--

Lucas,
First, my initial comment was to you, not to Marcus, or to others.  =
Perhaps a backchannel might have diffused matters earlier, for I did =
never intend to insult you.  If you took insult at my response to your =
comments to Paul, then, clearly, I wrote poorly. =20

Second, Well said here!

Third and final...I disagree. =20

Your comments with and, more importantly 'at' Paul serve only to =
underscore the idea: you have an opinion and Paul has an opinion...your =
criticism of his opinion is virtue-less.  To assume otherwise is to =
assume your opinion has a greater moral (virtuous) value than his =
opinion.  And in truth, it does not.=20

On that point, I again utter, there is no virtue in criticism. =20

However, you are accurate in your details.  I deserve my lumps for my =
role in having moved the discussion to an almost out of control =
position.  I may have been a tad too sensitive to Marcus' silly =
question, and to his follow-on bit of inane and somewhat flippant =
remark. (And, YES!!! that is my personal opinion: "silly" question and =
"flippant" remark.  As the recipient of the communication, I am entitled =
to my personal feelings regarding the intent of the author...had Marcus =
intended other than to snidely snipe me with his brevity, he'd have =
taken the time, as you did here Lucas, to make more than a snitty quip). =


Lucas, neither you nor I with each other have dropped to that level of =
personal attack in our communications. =20

That level of deterioration only happened between Marcus and Alex...and =
I add, begun by Marcus. =20

However, I'm delighted for all that followed, for, in a very minor way, =
that which followed demonstrates how easy it is for opinions to command =
the moment?  And, I stand on my moment: doesn't this demonstrate the =
lack of virtue in criticism?  But, that's a point of the discussion =
which has long been lost.=20

And, Lucas, while your intent with Paul may have been straightforward =
and well-intentioned, I hold to my view regarding your commentary.  You =
have armed the adversary, not disarmed him.  And you armed him with your =
vitriolic response.=20

We don't need more bullets and ranting from either side of the =
discussion regarding the mess in the Middle-East...we need people to sit =
and talk more and shoot less.  =20

Criticism of the views of your adversary...verbal, or otherwise...only =
incubates further hatred and increases the level of criticism.  I think =
we have seen that here in the minor responses made between Marcus and =
me. =20

Sorry, I hold to my view...there is no virtue in that criticism.

Lucas, we are not discussing here whether an essayist or a poet =
misapplied a metrical pattern in the "X" stanza of his or her Canto.  =
Critical commentary on that level may hold some value for both the =
creator and the audience/readership, but in this instance, there are no =
bullets or bombs nor will there be people dying. =20

The world doesn't need more criticism regarding the Middle-East; what we =
do need is for the highly opinionated (mostly religious opinions) =
adversaries to shut the hell up and actually listen to each other.  It =
is entirely possible both sides have something of value (not virtue) to =
bring to the discussion. =20

Finally, Lucas, I would ask you to examine the base meaning of the word =
virtue. Inherent in the context of that word is a critical opinion in =
and of itself: "...the quality of doing what is right and avoiding doing =
what is wrong." =20

One must demand: by whose standards?  If the standards are by the =
Western European Christians, one may not necessarily be in harmony with, =
say, certain Muslim sects, or even various other religious sects. =20

How does one cope with the issue of the differences in values regarding =
the definition of right and wrong to underscore the meaning of the word =
virtue? =20

Thank you for your thoughtful comments, and I do wish you well. =20

Let us hold to this point: we disagree.=20

But, we may do so with respect for each other's POV.=20

This may be one of the reasons I don't want to go to heaven...all the =
folks there will hold to the same beliefs.  Boring?  I should think so.  =

  Dear Alex, Marcus, and others:

  =20

  I step back into this conversation with a bit of trepidation, because =
I
  don't want to come off as defensive. Nonetheless, I see things going =
on in
  this conversation that are explicitly against the hopes I put to use =
when
  criticizing Paul's obnoxious rant in the first place.

  =20

  When Alex writes "Stop attacking me personally.  Address the =
statement.
  Either refute it of not, but stick to the point." and then says to =
Marcus "I
  sure as hell hope you aren't in a position of importance in our public
  school or public university systems...if you are, you may well be the =
reason
  the GOP is winning the war on education they are waging when they =
claim our
  school system is in the toilet" He seems to me both to be sensitive =
to, and
  then to be propagating, the very kind of nastiness and aggression I =
was
  decrying in the first place. I think we'd all be better off if we =
tried to
  avoid these kinds of personal attacks.

  =20

  As poets and readers of poetry, I think we should all be pretty clear =
on the
  difference, and yet interrelationship, between form and content. What =
you
  say and how you say it interact with each other, and yet are not each =
other.
  For the record, Alex, I am not closed to the possibility that Paul, or
  anyone, is right. In fact, one of the things I wrote to Paul was, =
"Paul:
  your behavior embarrasses me, because so often I want to agree with =
what you
  say, and yet I am alienated and offended by how you say it." I cannot
  reconcile my saying that with your assertion that I have "already made =
up
  [my mind] they are the ranting and the illogical" or that I "attempt =
more to
  attack the person than to argue the point." That's the exact opposite =
of
  what I wanted to convey in the first place! My point, very simply, was =
that
  Paul, and anyone who reverts to belligerence and insults, is doing the =
whole
  argument a disservice. The impropriety of the form gets in the way of =
any
  validity of the content. Until we can find an appropriate form to =
express
  our content, we will suffer, I think, not only in literature but in =
life, as
  well. I say this as someone who is working to address and redress this
  problem within himself, not only within others.

  =20

  To this I feel that I have to append a thought on the idea that there =
is no
  virtue in criticism. Such an idea, Alex, seems completely unpalatable =
to me.
  The question is, who is served by such a statement? I think the only =
people
  served by such an aversion to criticism are the people in power, and =
I'm not
  generally interested in adding to the power that they already have. =
I'm sure
  you're not, either, even though I know nothing about you. If there is =
virtue
  in anything, then there is virtue in criticism.

  =20

  If there is not virtue in anything, though, then I think we're dealing =
with
  a different conversation. One very far from whether belligerence is
  appropriate in any discussion.

Japanese memory is also terribly selective. Because of
the trauma, but also because it bears an imperialist
past. Many of the victims in Hiroshima were actually
Korean forced labor, although, according to the
terminology of Japanese edicts, they had been
"mobilized" or had "volunteered," just as so-called
"comfort women" (ianfu [Japanese], wianbu [Korean])
supposedly had as well.

Some post-war Japanese research groups have estimated
that over one-sixth of the dead in Hiroshima were
Korean. How is that possible? Ground Zero was,
logically enough, the Mitsubishi munitions factories
where, logically, the Japanese war machine had
deployed its colonial slaves. Ethnic or national
distinctions were, of course, beyond the ken of the
USA's Little Boy and Fat Man.

There is a history of Japanese delegates to
international nuclear disarmament and peace events
having a hard time sharing the stage/agenda with
Korean activists. That cities like Hiroshima were not
only victimized, but deadly military-industrial
victimizers was too complex a concept to convey to
Western anti-nuke and Japanophile audiences. This
eventually changed beginning in the late 1980s.

I should also mention that, a generation after the end
of World War II, it was Japanese organizations more
than South Korea that tried to do something
significant for surviving victims by establishing a
medical clinic and other services. So one could say
that Korean memory was also selective. It had a hard
time acknowledging the scope and horror of what its
civilians had undergone. South Korea was also still a
relatively poor country (unlike the more quickly
industrializing North) that had a hard time providing
any welfare system at all.

In some cases, it was the Japanese language, rather
than Japan, that "remembers well." Some of the Korean
victims could not recall anything about the time
unless they were interviewed and spoke in Japanese.

Despite all the abuses of "trauma theory" that have
occured in recent literary criticism, one of the
incisive points that Cathy Caruth made in her analysis

there is no exact point of death or catastrophe to be

Alex, you are completely wrong:

1.) You are equating positive moral value with virtue. That is incorrect. Virtue is related to the idea of goodness and of positive moral value, but
they are not interchangable

2.) Even given that you mean to say something like "moral value" when you're talking about virtue, it's not at all to be granted that all opinions
have moral values that are equal. In fact, my opinion that, to take a ludicrous example, stealing candy from babies is wrong, is morally superior to
the opinion of some other person who holds the opinion that stealing candy from babies is morally neutral, and therefore, my expressing that opinion
forcefully is not just virtuous, it is a necessary act. Were I to withhold that opinion and allow that other person to continue with his unchallenged
opinion that stealing candy from babies is laudable, I would in fact be culpable in his further expressions of that opinion by stealing candy from
poor defenseless babies who, quite possibly, had worked very hard to earn their candy. I think you'll find that argument to be totally unassailable
and I hope that by expressing this argument, which is true, and also my opinion, and also a fact, you will be motivated to stop saying foolish things
like "There is no virtue in criticism." It's either meaningless or totally false, and really, it doesn't matter how you slice it, my opinion is that
people shouldn't go around spouting either false aphorisms or meaningless babble masquerading as true aphorisms. That is, of course, the correct
opinion, and I'll be happy to defend it any day of the week should you wish to continue with this, but only after you've carefully read your way
through the syllabus of books on ethics, moral philosophy and the philosophy of language that i would be happy to prepare for you.

It may be that two particular opinions are equally virtue-less, but
to ascribe virtue-less-ness to ALL opinions is to deny that there is
any possibility of either facts or truth. When you say "There is no
virtue in criticism" you are denying the possibility of either facts
or truth. The consequence of that is a resort to force, and a
reliance on force to ensure that the opinions of those who command
the force are justified in using force. As I understand your point of
view with regard to the Arab/Israeli conflict, this puts you squarely
on the side of the Israelis, of approving the use of force to try to
control the Palestinians by force.

Yes, to characterise the question or the remark is not to make a
personal attack; to say that my remarks are silly is one thing; to
say that I am silly is another. There is room within your claim that
my remarks are silly for me to try to show that they are not; but
there is no room in an accusation that I am silly to demonstrate that
I am not. That's why there is a distinction between ad rem and ad
hominem -- so that we may engage with one another about our opinions
instead of resorting to name-calling.

> That level of deterioration only happened between Marcus and

I asked whether you recognized the contradiction inherent in
criticising someone by saying that all criticism are virtueless. You
responded by claiming to be virtueless in a far wider sense. You
called yourself names. It was an astonishing performance.

I disagree fundamentally with this. I hold that criticism of the
VIEWS of your adversary is the essence of civil discourse. What is
incendiary, what incubates hatred, is name-calling and ad hominem
attack.

> Sorry, I hold to my view...there is no virtue in that criticism.<

Well, then, to the extent that you criticize other people or their
views, you must hold that you have no virtue -- it's that simple.
Now, I realize that you have agreed that you have no virtue, that you
are too "cynical and opinionated" to claim any virtue whatever, that
you are self-described as virtue-less, and that you seem to be proud
of it. But why are you proud to be virtue-less? What is it about lack
of virtue that seems so attractive to you that you not only claim it
but embrace it?

By recognizing the context within which the word "virtue" is used --
just the same way one copes with the issues of differences in meaning
for any other word, of course.

A few further words about Jim Weil:

I first met Jim Weil, after being in correspondence with him for some =
time, about twenty years ago at an exhibit of William Bronk papers at =
Columbia University. He was a warm and gentle man, and wonderfully =
smart. We continuied to correspond until shortly before his demise. I =
was lucky enough to be the recipient of his gorgeous small book =
productions (he was a true lover of books, and so he crafted beautiful =
ones), collectors' items every one,--collections of his verse, the poems =
of Bronk, and of others. I was lucky enough to have a blurb of Jim's on =
the back of a chapbook of mine, First Life. He was a good friend. And as =
has been said--I'll simply say amen to it--he is a very important =
chapter of our literary history. Jim loved quiet beauty, modesty. His =
poems, some of them, are small gems.

I had thought not to say anything since Ed Foster had posted what I =
regarded as a fitting obit. But now I see that I should have. I'll miss =
Jim keenly.

Subject: James L. Weil and the Elizabeth Press

I find it tough to believe that no one here has something to say about =
Jim Weil who is definitely one the most important American poetry =
publishers of the 1960's and 70's. While I might guess that from this =
list only Ed Foster, Jenny Penberthy and myself (& maybe David =
Kirschenbaum) have had direct contact with him (as others I know are not =
subscribed here), it seems important to mention his contribution as my =
work brought him to his publishing, not his poetry. =20
  =20
  Weil ran the Elizabeth Press from the early 1960's until 1982; during =
this period he published the first collections by Simon Perchik, Carroll =
Arnett, and John Taggart. Some of his other authors included Lorine =
Niedecker, Larry Eigner, Ted Enslin, Anselm Hollo, and John =
Perlman(whose first book he might also have published). From the early =
60's to the late 70's he was the primary publisher of William Bronk, Cid =
Corman, Simon Perchik, John Perlman and Carroll Arnett. Life Supports by =
William Bronk, when re-issued by another press, won the National Book =
Award in 1982.
  =20
  For me his importance was what it lead me towards, reading _Which Hand =
Holds the Brother_ by Simon Perchik lead me to re-issuing all of his =
Elizabeth Books. Reading Larry Eigner's Elizabeth books led me toward =
reading a publication called L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE which had a =
feature about him, which in turn lead me to reading and eventually =
publishing Bob Grenier. My extensive work with editing Hands Collected =
The Books of Simon Perchik (which includes six books from Elizabeth =
Press) as well as a Collected of Carroll Arnett (which also includes six =
books from Elizabeth) and talks with Cid Corman about issuing a Selected =
(including probably a dozen of Elizabeth books, which was eventually =
released by New Directions)  are what brought me in contact with him.=20

  He also published 18 issues of Elizabeth between 1961 and 1971. Some =
of their better known authors were Diane Wakoski, Cid Corman, George =
Oppen, Ron Offen, Lewis Turco, Richard Crashaw, William Stafford, Simon =
Perchik, Felix Stefanile, David Ignatow, Carroll Arnett, Loring =
Williams, Anselm Hollo, Robert Creeley, John Taggart, George Bowering, =
Paul Blackburn as well as many others.


Be well

     I'd like to publicly apologize to Frank Sherlock for insinuating, in yesterday's post, that he had something to do with the rumours circulating about me. I now know that in fact he had nothing to do with these rumours, and, if anything, was defending me against them. Sorry, Frank, for the misunderstanding, and I'm glad we got this straightened out.

A small but maybe characteristic detail about Jim: I met him late 60's when
we were printing many of the same authors, especially Ted Enslin. His
workspace in his New Rochelle house was the attic, and his desk faced a
crawlspace in which he had placed a bust of Keats. Lou

Some very, very sobering quotes here:
http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm

"...the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them
with that awful thing."
- *Ike on Ike*, Newsweek, 11/11/63

Norman Cousins was a consultant to General MacArthur during the American
occupation of Japan. Cousins writes of his conversations with MacArthur,
"MacArthur's views about the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki were starkly different from what the general public supposed."
He continues, "When I asked General MacArthur about the decision to drop the
bomb, I was surprised to learn he had not even been consulted. What, I
asked, would his advice have been? He replied that he saw no military
justification for the dropping of the bomb. The war might have ended weeks
earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway,
to the retention of the institution of the emperor."
Norman Cousins, *The Pathology of Power*, pg. 65, 70-71.

July was a month of making new neologisms for me.  Resist generic
english & use these in a sentence.

Thanks for these mIEKAL.

I love skimplex. Gotta use that one.

Q. How do feel about lithikon, an i for an o. I can give reasons, I'm
ashamed to say. Hey, what about lithocon for a rock concert where the band
mimes to a tape?

mIEKAL
I like these, and most definitely want to incorporate a few of them into my daily speech habits but i have some questions:

1.) splatterdox. I assume that following normal morphological conventions, the plural would be "splatterdoxes?" My real question though, is can we abstract from splatterdox the noun, splatterdoxical the adjective? Maybe more interesting: what sorts of beliefs might amount splatterdoxy?

2.) pulikixa: is this a noun or an interjection or both. I think it should be both. Or maybe, just maybe, it's an irregular adverb, and one can build pulikixa, and the noun form would be pulik. Can we then add the ixa suffix to googlesmirk to get googlesmirkixa as the adverbal form and say something like "I ponkpunketted googlesmikiza all the squabulition out of my mother's new-fangled Splatterdoxy?"

so what have we got here?=20

1. online journals / blogs / etc.
2. print journals / mags / etc.=20

I've been waiting for someone to bring up chap books -- where do they
fall in the current verse taxonomy? the chap books I've seen (every one
a delight) since I jumped on this list have been virtual...=20

as a typesetter, I know something of the nightmares involved when it
comes time to convert MS into the final to-press version of the text...
hard copy at least gives the author a chance to convey how he or she
wants their text to appear -- unfortunately, my authors have been a bit
too green to care how I set their books for 'em... only the priestess of
the Ancient Egyptian gods fretted much about how I laid out her pages...

I do all of my own submissions on-line, which is fast and convenient and
I don't have to think twice (does art therefore suffer? better it than
me)... but I try to make things easier by formatting as simply as is
reasonable...=20
it helps that I have a healthy appreciation for unpredictability as a
midwife to my writing -- usually the effect of strangers mishandling my
work makes it a lot better, or at least different and interesting (to my
current thinking)...

i thought it'd be splatterdoxa? as in doxa?
ponkpunket sounds like an East Coast indigenous word.  There are
fabulous placenames like Winnepesaukee, Weweantic, Woonsocket,
Ponkapoag and Succonesset.

China Tightening Control Over Tibet
Even Amid Talks, Party Moves to Curb Influence of
Dalai Lama

By Maureen Fan
Washington Post Foreign Service
Saturday, August 5, 2006; Page A16

BEIJING, Aug. 4 -- China's Communist Party has been
tightening its grip on Tibet in recent months,
resorting to language and measures not seen since the
repression of the late 1990s, according to sources
with knowledge of the situation.

The pressure comes as the Dalai Lama's envoys continue
to negotiate with Beijing about his possible return to
Tibet after more than 40 years in exile. The religious
leader is regarded by the Chinese as bent on
independence for the region, and his followers are
seen as subversives.

"In the last few weeks, we have seen an increasingly
repressive political climate on Tibet as Beijing
emphasizes its domination of the region," said Kate
Saunders, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based
International Campaign for Tibet. "It's difficult to
discern the intentions of the senior leadership on the
ongoing dialogue between the Dalai Lama's
representatives and Beijing."

Nongovernmental organizations in Tibet say they have
started to feel the pressure. Some contracts to work
in the region reportedly have not been renewed. Last
month, a study program between American universities
and Tibet University was closed in the city of Lhasa
after 20 students arrived and were turned away,
sources said on condition of anonymity. The official
reason for the closure was that the teachers were too
busy.

Also last month, authorities shut down the blogs of a
well-known Tibetan writer who posted a photograph of
the Dalai Lama and wished him a happy birthday, his
71st.

Some Tibet observers say the timing of the tightening
could be a sign that various factions in the Communist
Party are engaged in a power struggle, with
hard-liners opposed to any deal that would bring the
religious leader back from his exile in Dharamsala,
India. But others argue that Chinese leaders have
several cards and are playing them simultaneously,
essentially negotiating on Tibet while still cracking
down on the Dalai Lama's followers, said Robbie
Barnett, professor of modern Tibetan studies at
Columbia University.

"Perhaps this is to wear down the Dalai Lama and
threaten his power base," Barnett said.

A story run in two Chinese newspapers and carried by
the official New China News Agency asserted late last
month that, while the Dalai Lama has told the world he
seeks autonomy or a "middle way" rather than
independence, he is not to be believed. "Given the
fact that the Dalai Lama gives out different signals
at different times and even at the same time, one can
hardly agree his 'middle way' is different from
'Tibetan independence,' " the article said.

The Chinese government has moved to block any
influence the Dalai Lama has over Tibetans. Earlier
this year, after the religious leader made a plea to
protect endangered species and his followers began
destroying their fur-lined traditional robes, the
Chinese government banned Tibetans from burning fur
pelts. Then, after monks clashed in a dispute over
clay statues of an obscure deity at a monastery near
Lhasa, the city's mayor accused the Dalai Lama of
stirring up trouble and trying to "sabotage the unity
of Tibet."

There have long been cycles of repression and
relaxation in Chinese policy toward Tibet. The
previous two party secretaries in the region were
considered technocrats who were more focused on
economic development, observers said.

But the current secretary, Zhang Qingli, who once
served in the Communist Youth League with President Hu
Jintao, has a strong record of making ideological
statements against separatism. A former commander of
the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps, Zhang had been charged with border security and
presiding over the migration of millions of Han
Chinese to Xinjiang.

An informed source in Lhasa who spoke on condition of
anonymity said thousands of government workers in
Phenpo, a rural area just northeast of Lhasa, had been
asked to write criticisms of the Dalai Lama. Similar
campaigns have targeted monasteries in the past, but
the source said it was unusual to involve civil
servants.

After being named to the post in May, Zhang had
quickly declared a stepping-up of the Communist
Party's patriotic education campaign in Tibet, beyond
monasteries and nunneries to the wider population. He
said it was a "fight-to- the-death struggle" with the
Dalai Lama, who was "the biggest obstacle hindering
Tibetan Buddhism from establishing normal order,"
according to state media reports.

Said Saunders, of the International Campaign for
Tibet: "It was almost Cultural Revolution language."

A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry did not return a
call seeking comment.

   There is certainly a possible difference, between illegal and =20
wrong,=3D20
   but the reason that things are illegal is that a large part of a=3D20
   society considers those things to be wrong. There are of course=3D20
   exceptions, and reasons to campaign to change the laws to reflect =20

   social attitudes, but again, that something is illegal makes it =20

to squirm out of your fuck ups:  "There is certainly a possible =3D

   There are two kinds of criticism: normative and critical. =
Normative=3D20
   criticism is, roughly, judgment about whether something is right =
or=3D20
   wrong withing the norms of the society; critical criticism is=3D20
   judgment, roughly. about whether the norms of society reflect the=3D20
   attitudes of society accurately.
   I have a word for this equally weasel nonsense: horseshit! =3D20

   Are you drinking when you write this stuff, or are you on drugs?  Pay =
=20
=3D
attention to this, I'll use caps to help you see the differences: =3D
OPINION IS OPINION!  YOU CAN CALL IT JUDGEMENT OR YOU CAN CALL IT =3D
ANYTHING ELSE, IT IS STILL OPINION.  And, since it is opinion, I =20
repeat: =3D
There is no virtue in criticism. =3D20

   You seem to be thinking that whether something is virtuous or not =20
is=3D20
   a matter of critical judgment, while thinking that whether =20
something=3D20
   is legal or not is a matter of normative judgment. If I understand=3D20=

   you correctly, then, what you're claiming is that your critical=3D20
   judgment is worthless because you're self-described as too cynical=3D20=

   and opinionated to have such judgment. You may still be claiming =
to=3D20
   be able to tell whether something is legal or not (normative=3D20
   judgment), but you've abandoned all claims to critical judgment, =
or=3D20
   judgment of virtue.
   Marcus, what the hell is this nonsense? =3D20

   My statement was simple, I'll repeat it: There is no virtue in =3D
criticism.  That statement neither castigates another thinker, nor does =20=

=3D
it require a 600 word excuse for the fuck-up in your earlier comments.  =20=

=3D
Fact: criticism is opinion, ergo, I repeat: there is no virtue in =3D
opinion (criticism).  If in fact you lack the intellect to =20
differentiate =3D
between fact and opinion, I'm sorry, I really can't help you on this =3D
point. =3D20

   Lucas seemed to me to be distinguishing between the substance of =20
the=3D20
   issues and the manner of presentation -- and in this I agree with=3D20
   him. Name-calling and ad hominem attacks are deservedly relegated =20
to=3D20
   the category of fallaciousness. To urge people to stick to the =20
point=3D20
   and argue the issues on their merits, and refrain from personal =
and=3D20
   ad hominem attacks, seems less like a closing of Lucas's mind to =20
the=3D20

Well, it's hard to see your statement that there is no virtue in
criticism as other than black and white thinking. That's pretty
stark. For you to try to claim, now, after that kind of black and
white statement, that it is you who are the subtly nuanced thinker
seems rather like killing both your parents and throwing yourself on
the mercy of the court on the grounds you're an orphan.

Sure, and that's the position I'm suggesting I hold in this instance,
since it was you who made the black and white claim. Try to keep up.

Deliberately misunderstanding an analogy does not help your argument,
especially not at this late date after you've admitted to being so
cynical and opinionated that you lack all virtue. It may not be a
certainty that those who lack all virtue are felons, but that's the
way to bet. You might want to be more careful in future about your
claims to lack of virtue. It's a little late in this instance,
though.

There is certainly a possible difference, between illegal and wrong,
but the reason that things are illegal is that a large part of a
society considers those things to be wrong. There are of course
exceptions, and reasons to campaign to change the laws to reflect new
social attitudes, but again, that something is illegal makes it wrong
is the way to bet.

There are two kinds of criticism: normative and critical. Normative
criticism is, roughly, judgment about whether something is right or
wrong withing the norms of the society; critical criticism is
judgment, roughly. about whether the norms of society reflect the
attitudes of society accurately.

You seem to be thinking that whether something is virtuous or not is
a matter of critical judgment, while thinking that whether something
is legal or not is a matter of normative judgment. If I understand
you correctly, then, what you're claiming is that your critical
judgment is worthless because you're self-described as too cynical
and opinionated to have such judgment. You may still be claiming to
be able to tell whether something is legal or not (normative
judgment), but you've abandoned all claims to critical judgment, or
judgment of virtue.

Lucas seemed to me to be distinguishing between the substance of the
issues and the manner of presentation -- and in this I agree with
him. Name-calling and ad hominem attacks are deservedly relegated to
the category of fallaciousness. To urge people to stick to the point
and argue the issues on their merits, and refrain from personal and
ad hominem attacks, seems less like a closing of Lucas's mind to the
possibility of there being merit to Paul's position than like a
reasonable demand that the discussion be carried out at a reasonable
pitch and pace.

The claim "There is no virtue in criticism" is a criticism.
If the claim is the true, the claim contradicts itself because if
there is no virtue in criticism, there is no virtue in the claim
itself.
If the claim is false, then there is virtue in the claim because the
claim is false.

Alex, if there can be no difference between what is wrong and what is
illegal, then there can be no difference between what is right and
what is legal -- which means that there can be no critical analysis
of the law and, thus, no way to change it. There must be a possible
difference between what is illegal and what is wrong so that there
can be a possible difference between what is right and what is legal
so that we can have a critical analysis of the law.

Once again, Alex, if you deny that there is ever any difference
between what is illegal and what is wrong, or between what is legal
and what is right, you cannot have a critical analysis of the law,
because you will have taken the position that the law is always
right.

This claim is just as easy to refute:

The claim "There is no virtue in opinion" is an opinion.
If the claim is the true, the claim contradicts itself because if
there is no virtue in opinion, there is no virtue in the claim
itself.
If the claim is false, then there is virtue in the claim because the
claim is false.

Lucas may or may not agree with Paul's opinions about what to do or
not do with regard to the Israelis and Palestinians -- but what Lucas
said about Paul's tone and manner was that Paul's name-calling and
personal attack ought to be avoided. You criticised Lucas's criticism
by saying there is no virtue in criticism, and I pointed out that
that is a contradiction, a fallacy. I'm not really sure why you're
trying to defend the contradiction, but then, I'm not really sure why
you'd want to make it in the first place.

I say the screamers are the problem -- they're the ones saying "Kill
the enemy!" and other various extremist things. It is the screamers,
the zealots, the true believers who are creating the problem, on both
sides, and who create the problems on both sides in almost all
circumstances. That's why I, and Lucas, too, I think, oppose personal
attacks and ad hominem arguments.

Here we may agree, if by "rantings" you mean what "the screamers" say
-- though if you do, you've got another contradiction on your hands,=20
since just above you said that you think that it may be "the
screamers" whose rants we should be listening to.

Speech you don=3DB4t like, if you=3DB4re going to be civil, requires =
speech
that defends your views and argues against the views of others
instead of wheeling out the rusty artillery of abuse.

The example of imperturbable civility in the face of barbarian rage
is emblematic, I think, of what civilization is all about, and is the
best way in cyberspace (and cyberspace started with the first human
writing, I think) to persuade others (though not often one=3DB4s enraged
opponent, admittedly) of the virtues of such civility in the first
place and the validity of one=3DB4s arguments in the second.

The problem with the notion of "more speech" in response to speech
one doesn=3DB4t like is not that it has been tried and found wanting, =
but
that it has been tried and found difficult. It is, therefore, often
abandoned in favor of the far easier demand to suppress the speech
one doesn=3DB4t like.

People should use civil speech to establish boundaries and
definitions and to compare boundaries and definitions. One of the
most fascinating things about the internet is that it invites people
into a forum to discuss things with people they wouldn=3DB4t meet, or
wouldn=3DB4t meet often, or if they met wouldn=3DB4t talk to, in the =
flesh.

Some people, confronted with opinions they don=3DB4t want to hear, and
forbidden either to call their opponents names or demand the
suppression of their opponents views, vote with their feet. That's
too bad, because running away from opposing views seems to me to be
counter-productive and, ultimately, self-defeating. What seems to me
to be productive and virtuous is, instead, trying to educating
oneself, one's interlocutors, and the uncommitted bystanders through
discussion that addresses the merits of the issues at hand without
resorting to personal attack.

From:    David Baratier <editor@PAVEMENTSAW.ORG>
Subject: James L. Weil and the Elizabeth Press

I find it tough to believe that no one here has something to say about =20=

Jim Weil who is definitely one the most important American poetry =20
publishers of the 1960's and 70's. While I might guess that from this =20=

list only Ed Foster, Jenny Penberthy and myself (& maybe David =20
Kirschenbaum) have had direct contact with him (as others I know are =20
not subscribed here), it seems important to mention his contribution as =20=

my work brought him to his publishing, not his poetry.

   Weil ran the Elizabeth Press from the early 1960's until 1982; during =
=20
this period he published the first collections by Simon Perchik, =20
Carroll Arnett, and John Taggart. Some of his other authors included =20
Lorine Niedecker, Larry Eigner, Ted Enslin, Anselm Hollo, and John =20
Perlman(whose first book he might also have published). =46rom the early =
=20
60's to the late 70's he was the primary publisher of William Bronk, =20
Cid Corman, Simon Perchik, John Perlman and Carroll Arnett. Life =20
Supports by William Bronk, when re-issued by another press, won the =20
National Book Award in 1982.

   For me his importance was what it lead me towards, reading _Which =20
Hand Holds the Brother_ by Simon Perchik lead me to re-issuing all of =20=

his Elizabeth Books. Reading Larry Eigner's Elizabeth books led me =20
toward reading a publication called L=3DA=3DN=3DG=3DU=3DA=3DG=3DE which =
had a feature =20
about him, which in turn lead me to reading and eventually publishing =20=

Bob Grenier. My extensive work with editing Hands Collected The Books =20=

of Simon Perchik (which includes six books from Elizabeth Press) as =20
well as a Collected of Carroll Arnett (which also includes six books =20
from Elizabeth) and talks with Cid Corman about issuing a Selected =20
(including probably a dozen of Elizabeth books, which was eventually =20
released by New Directions)  are what brought me in contact with him.

   He also published 18 issues of Elizabeth between 1961 and 1971. Some =20=

of their better known authors were Diane Wakoski, Cid Corman, George =20
Oppen, Ron Offen, Lewis Turco, Richard Crashaw, William Stafford, Simon =20=

Perchik, Felix Stefanile, David Ignatow, Carroll Arnett, Loring =20
Williams, Anselm Hollo, Robert Creeley, John Taggart, George Bowering, =20=

Paul Blackburn as well as many others.

Subject: BookMooch

BookMooch is a community for exchanging used books.

BookMooch lets you give away books you no longer need in exchange for
books you really want.

# Give & receive: Every time you give someone a book, you earn a
point and can get any book you want from anyone else at BookMooch.
Once you've read a book, you can keep it forever or put it back into
BookMooch for someone else, as you wish.

# No cost: there is no cost to join or use this web site: your only
cost is mailing your books to others.

# Points for entering books: you receive a tenth-of-a-point for every
book you type into our system, and one point each time you give a
book away. In order to keep receiving books, you need to give away at
least one book for every two you receive.

# Help charities: you can also give your points to charities we work
with, such as children's hospitals (so a sick kid can get a free book
delivered to their bed), Library fund, African literacy, or to us to
thank us for running this web site <grin>.

# World wide: BookMooch is not just for Americans. You can request
books from other countries, in other languages. You receive 2 points
when you send a book out of your country, to help compensate you for
the greater mailing cost. John Buckman, who runs BookMooch, lives
both in California and London, England, and was frustrated by the
vast number of books that were printed in just one country but not
any another, or only after several years. Translations into French,
German and other languages are planned, and we already work fine with
the various Amazon worldwide databases.

# Wishlist: you can keep a "book wish list" that will automatically
arrive to you when you have the points and/or the book becomes
available in our catalog. Others earn 2 points if they supply a book
on your wishlist, so everyone is highly motivated to help find books
others are looking for.

# All books: our goal is to make more use out of all books, to help
keep books from becoming unavailable. The worst thing that can happen
to a book is for no-one to be able to read it.

# Feedback score: each time you receive a book, you can leave
feedback with the sender, just like how eBay does it. If you keep
your feedback score up, people are most likely to help you out when
you ask for a book.

Kevin:

The original catalog entire is reproduced in Stephnie Barron's excellent
book DEGENERATE ART  The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany along =20=

with
the floor plan of the exhibit and 150 reproductions and list of al the
artits etc.
      Actually itwas one of the first realblockbuster exhibits f the =
20th
century, drawing 3 million people in its travels--ironically making the
degenarte art a huge hit and seen by far more poeple than the =20
opfficially
apporved National Socialist Art.
      Another weird twist is that included in the exhibit to show the
degeneracy of the modern artists on dispaly were works from the famous
Prinzhorn collection of art by by the insane.  Prinzhorn's book =20
BILDNEREI
DER GEISTESKRANKEN had had an immense impact on the work of Klee and =20
many
other artists as well as the Surrealists and led in part to Dubuffet's
development of Art Brut collections and the beginnings of recognitions =20=

of
outsider art.  The Nazis reversed the direction by hanging the mentally =20=

ill
alongside those they had influenced to show not the artistic merit of =20=

the
insane but the insanity of the artists.       The Barron book also has
essays making connections between the Nazis' ideas on degeneracy in =20
modern
art and contemporary ones of the time period (the book came out in 1991,
connected with huge exhibition in LA).

Subject: Contact for Poetique???

hi all:
I can't find out how to contact the french journal Poetique.  Are
there any French folks or folks living in Paris who have any idea how
to get in touch with them?  I need to find out the original German
source for a Karlheinz Stierle article they published in #32 (back in
1977).  Can't find an E-dress or even a mailing address, let alone a
phone #.
any help wd be appreciated.
thanks all --md

Adam Fielded, you owe Frank Sherlock a VERY PUBLIC apology for using his

He did not spread any rumors about you.  Nor did I.  In fact, the  =20
person who
suspected you

I
told them that I
would not back them up because it wasn't clear who was attacking Jessica

A little advice dear Adam, JUST BECAUSE you think you're clever doesn't =20=

you are.

When you start that Ph.D. program next month you might want to consider
doing some

I wish I could I say I'm surprised.

The community where I did my undergraduate work was devastated by the farm
crisis in the 1980s and the local arsenal, which was shipping arms to
Central America, became the largest employer in the area (and people were
desperately afraid of losing even more jobs).  The arsenal had an annual
"armed forces day" where you could come and tour the facility, take the kids
on tank rides, etc.  They would actually advertise it with pictures of kids
in tanks, in fact.

my wife's from nagasaki she's in fact going back there to day for a
coupla weeks for the bon fest
she and i disgree the bomb was very bad news
but 2nd onw tho in our opinion wrog as was first was not terrorism but
blatant act of experimentation coupled with the fact that japan military
and hirohito were still not prepared to surrender
and  even when they did it was sadly aug 15 during thebon fest
and he used the possibly invasion by russia as the reason  he being as
were the military
true terrorists  ie forcing young intellectuals to become sfirst recorded
suicide bombers

yes and nagasaki was the center of christian faith
and there was and american pow camp in hiroshima as there was in dresden
where even more were killed

Subject: New Flowers of Evil translation
To: lori.emerson@gmail.com


We are pleased to announce an exciting new translation of Baudelaire's
The Flowers of Evil, by Keith Waldrop.

This modernist poetic masterpiece is one of the most frequently read
and studied works in the French language. In this compelling new
translation of Baudelaire's most famous collection, Keith Waldrop
recasts the poet's original French alexandrines and other poetic
arrangements into versets, a form that hovers between poetry and
prose. Maintaining Baudelaire's complex view of sound and structure,
Waldrop's translation mirrors the intricacy of the original without
attempting to replicate its inimitable verse. The result is a powerful
new re-imagining, one that is, almost paradoxically, closer to
Baudelaire's own poetry than any previous English translation.
Including the six poems banned from the first edition, this Flowers of
Evil preserves the complexity, eloquence, and dark humor of its
author.

Dear Alex,

=20

Thank you for this response. You=92re right that you haven=92t insulted =
me, and
I=92m glad for it. But I=92d also like to point out again that I =
didn=92t
criticize Paul=92s opinion or his views; I criticized how he expressed =
those
opinions and views.

=20

We could continue talking about virtue and where it exists vis-=E0-vis
criticism. Suffice it to say that I think of criticism as a very =
virtuous
act, regardless of how much cultural relativism we want to bring into =
the
discussion; this is not to say that individual acts of criticism may, in =
the
way they are expressed, sacrifice their virtue, but again, that=92s a
different issue (of course, if I=92m guilty of such lost virtue due to =
badly
expressed criticism=97did I sink to his level?=97then the question is =
then about
the worth of my criticism on a scale of what I=92ve achieved and what =
I=92ve
lost. But that=92s something I=92d prefer not to discuss in abstract =
terms, and
probably isn=92t worth public discussion on the Poetics list). While I =
gather
that a few others on this list also disagree that criticism could be
absolutely virtue-less, I also get the sense that this discussion is =
losing
steam, and so I don=92t need to see an argument that ends only in =
complete
agreement of all sides.

=20

But rather than talk about virtue (and yes, I acknowledge that I brought =
the
terms into the discussion), I=92d prefer to talk about self-interest. So =
let
me put it this way: at a certain level, I see much of the purpose of =
life to
be in gaining allies and achieving results through unity with those =
allies.
As members of the Poetics list, I think we=92re here to make allies with =
each
other and find ways to move our poetry forward; politics has often =
entered
into the discussion, and I think it=92s done for the same purpose: to =
make
political progress with the help of our allies. When arguments happen, I
view them as an ironing out of the wrinkles that occur in finding =
allies, or
in other words, we argue so we can reach agreement with and have a =
better
understanding of our allies. If our arguments end up, instead, in =
alienating
us from our potential allies, then I think we=92re actually working =
against
our best self-interests. And that=92s what I was criticizing when I =
wrote
about how Paul expressed himself, and that=92s what I was criticizing =
when I
wrote about how you were attacking Marcus. I just don=92t think it=92s =
in our
best self-interest to express ourselves that way, virtue or no.

=20

I could put it another way: if I want you to listen to me, and I feel =
like
I=92m not getting through, in my frustration I might feel like shouting
something like GOD DAMN IT WHY THE FUCK DON=92T YOU FUCKING LISTEN TO ME =
YOU
FUCKING MOTHERFUCKER! But I don=92t think that=92s going to put anyone =
in a mood
to listen to me! My interests would be better served, I think, by being
patient and generous and trying to find a better way to express myself, =
to
find a way to express myself in a way you=92ll actually want to listen =
to.

=20

That has no bearing on the matter expressed, of course. And that=92s why =
I=92m
firm on the point that I didn=92t criticize Paul=92s opinions. The fact =
is, I
don=92t know enough about the middle-east to feel comfortable making =
much
criticism to begin with. I have my recourse mode=97critical of US =
foreign
policy, sympathetic with innocent victims everywhere=97but I don=92t =
know enough
to engage in a critical discussion. Contrast this with my criticism of =
your
views, Alex, where you say that there is no virtue in criticism. I=92m
critical of your opinion, and not with how you express yourself (at =
least to
me). I think these are=97or at least can be=97completely separate =
issues. And I
also think that the point is to gain allies and make progress. I see
criticism as an essential=97even virtuous=97part of that process, but =
only when
the criticism is, as they say, constructive, only when the goal is to
strengthen our allegiance and weaken the stance of our enemies.

=20

And I consider no one on this list my enemy.

=20

Lucas

=20

=20

=20

=20

=20

=20

Lucas,

First, my initial comment was to you, not to Marcus, or to others.  =
Perhaps
a backchannel might have diffused matters earlier, for I did never =
intend to
insult you.  If you took insult at my response to your comments to Paul,
then, clearly, I wrote poorly. =20

Second, Well said here!

Third and final...I disagree. =20

Your comments with and, more importantly 'at' Paul serve only to =
underscore
the idea: you have an opinion and Paul has an opinion...your criticism =
of
his opinion is virtue-less.  To assume otherwise is to assume your =
opinion
has a greater moral (virtuous) value than his opinion.  And in truth, it
does not.=20

On that point, I again utter, there is no virtue in criticism. =20

However, you are accurate in your details.  I deserve my lumps for my =
role
in having moved the discussion to an almost out of control position.  I =
may
have been a tad too sensitive to Marcus' silly question, and to his
follow-on bit of inane and somewhat flippant remark. (And, YES!!! that =
is my
personal opinion: "silly" question and "flippant" remark.  As the =
recipient
of the communication, I am entitled to my personal feelings regarding =
the
intent of the author...had Marcus intended other than to snidely snipe =
me
with his brevity, he'd have taken the time, as you did here Lucas, to =
make
more than a snitty quip).=20

Lucas, neither you nor I with each other have dropped to that level of
personal attack in our communications. =20

That level of deterioration only happened between Marcus and Alex...and =
I
add, begun by Marcus. =20

However, I'm delighted for all that followed, for, in a very minor way, =
that
which followed demonstrates how easy it is for opinions to command the
moment?  And, I stand on my moment: doesn't this demonstrate the lack of
virtue in criticism?  But, that's a point of the discussion which has =
long
been lost.=20

And, Lucas, while your intent with Paul may have been straightforward =
and
well-intentioned, I hold to my view regarding your commentary.  You have
armed the adversary, not disarmed him.  And you armed him with your
vitriolic response.=20

We don't need more bullets and ranting from either side of the =
discussion
regarding the mess in the Middle-East...we need people to sit and talk =
more
and shoot less.  =20

Criticism of the views of your adversary...verbal, or otherwise...only
incubates further hatred and increases the level of criticism.  I think =
we
have seen that here in the minor responses made between Marcus and me. =20

Sorry, I hold to my view...there is no virtue in that criticism.

Lucas, we are not discussing here whether an essayist or a poet =
misapplied a
metrical pattern in the "X" stanza of his or her Canto.  Critical =
commentary
on that level may hold some value for both the creator and the
audience/readership, but in this instance, there are no bullets or bombs =
nor
will there be people dying. =20

The world doesn't need more criticism regarding the Middle-East; what we =
do
need is for the highly opinionated (mostly religious opinions) =
adversaries
to shut the hell up and actually listen to each other.  It is entirely
possible both sides have something of value (not virtue) to bring to the
discussion. =20

Finally, Lucas, I would ask you to examine the base meaning of the word
virtue. Inherent in the context of that word is a critical opinion in =
and of
itself: "...the quality of doing what is right and avoiding doing what =
is
wrong." =20

One must demand: by whose standards?  If the standards are by the =
Western
European Christians, one may not necessarily be in harmony with, say,
certain Muslim sects, or even various other religious sects. =20

How does one cope with the issue of the differences in values regarding =
the
definition of right and wrong to underscore the meaning of the word =
virtue?


Thank you for your thoughtful comments, and I do wish you well. =20

Let us hold to this point: we disagree.=20

But, we may do so with respect for each other's POV.=20

This may be one of the reasons I don't want to go to heaven...all the =
folks
there will hold to the same beliefs.  Boring?  I should think so. =20

Alex=20

=20

=20

=20

=20

Dear list folk:

A more interesting question for me this week relates to poets writing memoir.
 When I met up with poet, Tony Sanders, again after a long break from school,
we stayed on the phone for two or three days while he told the story of
living in Alaska.  I had never had this kind of experience before except by
reading.  It felt like reading a book to listen to him: an emotional and scenic
poet's volume.  I told him I thought he should write it, that it would make a
wonderful book, and he said he didn't believe poets ought to write memoirs.  He
cited a bad example of a poet who'd written about having sex with his dog.

Two memoirs I've read fairly recently and really liked are Bob Dylan's vol. 1
and Larry Woiwode's vol. 1.

In school there was a plot afoot to get all the women to write non-fiction
personal essay and autobiography, leaving fiction and poetry for the men.  It
only partly worked.  There was another plot to get the women not to think of
themselves as poets but as nursemaids.  That only partly worked.  One of my
friends, xta, a very talented poet, backburnered her own work and put songs first.
The songs were (very) good, but so were the poems.  Fifteen years later, she
has been self-printing some of the poems at her blog, which mostly pertains to
(good) autobiography.

I live in Minnesota but am not very active in the writing community here.  I
get out sometimes and have so far heard poetry the most.  It does seem,
however, that there must have been a plot afoot in Minnesota to get all the faculty
women to write autobiography.

Just curious about other people's ideas about writers & poets & memoir.
Please cite some good ones, too.

Two other exciting books along these lines I've read fairly recently are
Leslie Scalapino's Autobiography and Cris Mazza's Indigenous.  Scalapino's reads
like reluctant autobiography and is full of narrative & poetic irony; Mazza's
is about growing up happily in California and about not being let back in to
her native land, about being displaced to live as an academic in other states.

Dear list folk:

A more interesting question for me this week relates to poets writing
memoir.
 When I met up with poet, Tony Sanders, again after a long break from
school, we stayed on the phone for two or three days while he told the story
of living in Alaska.  I had never had this kind of experience before except
by reading.  It felt like reading a book to listen to him: an emotional and
scenic poet's volume.  I told him I thought he should write it, that it
would make a wonderful book, and he said he didn't believe poets ought to
write memoirs.  He cited a bad example of a poet who'd written about having
sex with his dog.

Two memoirs I've read fairly recently and really liked are Bob Dylan's vol.
1 and Larry Woiwode's vol. 1.

In school there was a plot afoot to get all the women to write non-fiction
personal essay and autobiography, leaving fiction and poetry for the men.
It only partly worked.  There was another plot to get the women not to think
of themselves as poets but as nursemaids.  That only partly worked.  One of
my friends, xta, a very talented poet, backburnered her own work and put
songs first.
The songs were (very) good, but so were the poems.  Fifteen years later, she
has been self-printing some of the poems at her blog, which mostly pertains
to
(good) autobiography.

I live in Minnesota but am not very active in the writing community here.  I
get out sometimes and have so far heard poetry the most.  It does seem,
however, that there must have been a plot afoot in Minnesota to get all the
faculty women to write autobiography.

Just curious about other people's ideas about writers & poets & memoir.
Please cite some good ones, too.

Ann Bogle

**Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 15th year =20
and East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also =20
published 35 volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work =20
by Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme =20
issues on baseball, women's writing, and Louisville, KY. It hosts and =20
curates two regular performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating =20
the renegade press, where each month a non-NYC small press and its =20
writers and a musical act of their choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA =20
Galleries; and Classic Albums Live, where 5-13 local musical acts =20
perform a classic album live at venues including The Bowery Poetry =20
Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past albums have included =20
Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; and Liz Phair, =20
Exile in Guyville.

**Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order =20
distributor based in New York City and interested in helping people =20
who are in the developmental stages of trying to do something with =20
their art. Olive Juice Music is not a traditional record label. The =20
artists associated with Olive Juice take an active part in how their =20
music is produced, financed, and marketed. They in turn receive more =20
of the profits gained from the sales of their records directly, which =20
is how it should be. The strength of Olive Juice relies upon the =20
active participation of its members to share resources and help =20
promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as claiming =20
responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it to =20
go.

**Laura Elrick's book Fantasies in Permeable Structures is just out =20
from Factory School (2005) in Vol. 1 of the Heretical Texts series. =20
She is also the author of sKincerity (Krupskaya, 2003) and is one of =20
the featured writers on Women In the Avant Garde, an audio CD produced =20
by Narrow House Recordings in 2004. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.

**Phoebe Kreutz is a little joke folk gal who likes her thrills as =20
cheap as her beer. She's always singing songs about silly stuff. This =20
past spring she headed off to confuse and delight audiences on her =20
first U.K. tour. Then she came home and will release her new album, =20
tentatively titled Feelings Up the Wazoo.

**Rodrigo Toscano is the author of To Leveling Swerve (Krupskaya =20
Books, 2004), Platform (Atelos, 2003), The Disparities (Green Integer, =20
2002), and Partisans (O Books, 1999). His work has recently appeared =20
in Best American Poetry (Scribners, 2004) and War and Peace (O Books, =20
2004). His poetry has been translated into French, German, Spanish, =20
Portuguese, and Italian. Toscano is originally from San Diego and San =20
Francisco California. He lives in New York City.

**The WoWz are a prolific three-piece miscellaneous band from New York =20
City who comb (and combine) the eternal dolor of Hank Williams Sr. =20
with the perverse humor of David Berman and the improbable harmonies =20
of BEATLES FOR SALE. Since 2004, they've recorded two full-length =20
records and an EP.

I don't see why poets shouldn't write their memoirs or autobiographies.  I would like to know if there is a difference between memoir and autobiography without taking a course to find out.  I'm too old for school.  I've been trying to write an autobiography for twenty years but never get beyond the first few pages.

Best title for a poet's memoir I can recall:

Neruda:  Confieso que he vivido



A really interesting one to read is Alfred Kreymborg's TROUBADOR -- worth it
just for the story of the day he and Willams took Marianne Moore to a baseball
game --

a memoir is an autobiography written to get on the now already gone memoir band
wagon in publishing and creative writing programs --

What did you think of Rae Armantrout's True? I thought
it was quite good (though the edition I read was
loaded with typos). Maybe poets should write more
brief memoirs. That is, short memoirs, not memoirs
about their briefs.

And of course Lyn's My Life is a great big monkey
wrench in the machinery that is our conventional
notions of memoir. What other memoirs (or memoir like
things) can you think of that question the
conventional tropes of "memoir"--linear narrative,
convivial or likable 1st person narrator, novelistic
structure, etc.?

Best,
Joseph

AM,

I've looked upon Gramsci's works: Prison Notebooks, as autobiographical. =
 While it is true he was more a political/social reform economist than a =
poet, I find a kind of poetry even in his essays.  And I don't view the =
works within the notebooks as chronologically autobiographical; rather I =
see them more as intellectually autobiographical as his thinking evolved =
during his years in prison.=20

  Dear list folk:

  A more interesting question for me this week relates to poets writing =
memoir.=20
   When I met up with poet, Tony Sanders, again after a long break from =
school,=20
  we stayed on the phone for two or three days while he told the story =

make a=20
  wonderful book, and he said he didn't believe poets ought to write =
memoirs.  He=20
  cited a bad example of a poet who'd written about having sex with his =
dog.

  Two memoirs I've read fairly recently and really liked are Bob Dylan's =
vol. 1=20
  and Larry Woiwode's vol. 1.

  In school there was a plot afoot to get all the women to write =
non-fiction=20
  personal essay and autobiography, leaving fiction and poetry for the =
men.  It=20
  only partly worked.  There was another plot to get the women not to =

  Please cite some good ones, too.

I hate memoirs. I hate them because they are both popular AND boring and I hate them on general principle. I hate the idea that people think they're interesting enough to be their own subjects. I hate the arrogance of the genre. I'd much rather read fictional stories than self-aggrandizing ones. I hate this faux-authenticity. The only people who I feel have any business writing about themselves are those who have already been written about by other people. To that end John Lydon's ghost written "Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs" is far more interesting to me than anything some middle class white dude has to say about quitting drinking. James Frey, of course, being the paradigm case of how a bad memoir is just as bad as a bad novel, the only difference being that novels at least have the option of making up interesting things to describe, where as memoirists are limited to their own boring lives.

God yeah "My Life" is great, "My Life" is the Anti-Memoir.

Another excellent Anti-Memoir is Herbert O. Yardley's "The Education of a Poker Player" which is a memoir masquerading as a guide to playing cards for money.

Two of my favorite memoirs are:

Christopher Dickey's Summer of Deliverance -- important, I think, =20
because of it's focus on a son's relationship with his father.

In the field of literature and medicine, a number of poignant memoirs =20=

(sometimes called autopathographies) are:  Audre Lorde's The Cancer =20
Journals; Lucy Grealy's Autobiography of a Face;  Nancy Mairs, Waist-=20
High In The World.

I have combined literary biography and personal memoir in It's Good =20
Weather For Fudge: Conversing With Carson McCullers -- a book-length =20
poem that conjoins McCullers' biography and my own experiences of =20
growing up in the South -- including drinking Pimm's Cups in the New =20
Orleans French Quarter, eating 'Po-Boys,"  and matters of war.

Well, in fact, Guillen wrote a memorable poem "Una cancion a Stalin,"
which begins: "Stalin, Capitan / a quien Chango protege y a quien
resguarde Ochun. / A tu lado, cantando, los hombres libres van."  It
goes on for a page and a half more, but you get the idea.

Yeah, it sounds like Neruda's anthem to Stalin,m
only more musical.

But _Illness as Metaphor_ is not a memoir, but rather
a philosophical work about various ways various
diseases have been regarded, sparked though the
thinking was by S.S.'s own battle with cancer...

I certainly understand the wish for memoirs by Sontag,
and unguarded reminiscences by her friends.  It would
for instance be very amusing and illuminating to know
in detail about the period during which she was first
getting enthusiastic about aspects of pop culture,
while still married to one of the hardest-line
old-style elitist culture professor types imaginable
("I *couldn't* tell him I went out to see Rock Around
The Clock after our argument", as she later
reminiscened in an interview).

I had hoped she would at least authorize her friends
to talk their heads off after she *died*, so there
could be a wonderful biography, but I don't know that
she did.  Apparently people like that celebrity
photographer she was entwined with want lots of stuff
to remain buried, and she honored that.

Earliest poet/autobiographer/memorialist in the Western European written
tradition?

        Archilochus (7thC BCE)

Basho as memoir rather than autobiography in +Narrow Road to the Deep
North+.

Petrarch (Ascent of Mount Ventoux, Secretum) tends to restart the tradition.

[Abelard -- History of My Own Calamities -- was earlier, but no poet.  As
far as I know.]

Wordsworth (obviously) in the Prelude.

I mean, so many are doing it in their poems (Lowell, Berryman) that there
isn't that much imaginative space for a prose account.

        Poets do it in letters.

Hi Tom

I called it a "Memoir" when I added lots of fictional sex at the behest of
my publisher (Maurice Girodias). I called it "Recollections" when I wrote
part of my autobiography.

We can "call" any of it anything we like, I suppose.

I think it would be safe to say that no publishers are interested in poetry anthologies as a genre, but lots are interested in particular areas. More details would help.

If a memoir is bad, it's bad for the same reason a book of poetry or
fiction is bad: it's bankrupt of imagination, and lacking in true courage
(as opposed to mere exhibitionism: *Rousseau*, in his "Confessions," somehow
manages both; and fits nicely into the fine French tradition of
body-honesty, too: see *Michel Leiris*  and de Beauvoir for more
recent examples).

So, a memoir has to be re-imagined, and not simply remembered or reported.

I've been plowing through dozens of memoirs lately (to develop a teaching
idea, mainly -- looking for excerpts that offer various "arguments" of the
life, different rhetorical re-inventions); and yes, most of them are bad --
boring, unimagined, bragging of what people used to be ashamed of (not that
either attitude is honorable, necessarily).

But most of the poetry books, most of the novels I read (when I just pull
the books randomly off the shelf), are a disappointment.

As to the good memoirs  (if sometimes unevenly so --well, good "prose
life-writing," anyway): some of these by poets, but not all (omitting, when
I can remember the earlier posts, the already-mentioned in this thread):

Philip Brady, To Prove My Blood
 Sartre, The Words
Alphonse Daudet, In the Land of of Pain
Edward Dahlberg, various
Gary Soto, various pieces
 John Edgar Wideman, Brothers and Keepers
C.S. Lewis, Surprised by Joy
Nabokov, Speak, Memory
Michael Ondaatje, Running in the Family
Paul West, Words for a Deaf Daughter
 Melissa Green, Color is the Suffering of Light
Paul Auster, The Invention of Solitude
...a second vote for Lucy Grealy
Goethe, Dichtung und Warheit
Lawrence, Seven Pillars of Wisdom
Zora Neale Hurston, Dust Tracks on the Road
Edwin Muir's Autobiography
Nathalie Sarraute, Childhood
Cellini, Autobiography
Ruskin, Praeterita
Hemingway, A Moveable Feast
Aeneas Gunn, We of the Never Never
Wole Soyinka, Ake
WC Williams, Autobiography...
Yeats's Autobiography
Stanislav Lem, Highcastle
Momaday, The Names
Chagall, My Life
Welty, One Writer's Beginnings
Henry Adams
Edward Said, Out of Place

...well, that's more than enough -- sorry, I''m a compuslive lister!

I'll be doing a couple of events next week in the Bay Area and would be
very happy to see you at either one.

+ MONDAY, AUGUST 14 @ 7:30 p.m. DAVID HADBAWNIK & RODNEY KOENEKE
BIRD & BECKETT BOOKS, SAN FRANCISCO (Diamond @ Chenery, 2 blocks from
Glen Park BART)
David's visiting after a year in San Marcos and will be reading from
his new book SF Spleen, just out from effing press. I'll be doing the
first Bay Area reading for my new book, Musee Mechanique. Bird &
Beckett's worth coming to just for a look around the store if you
haven't been before.

+ THURSDAY, AUGUST 17 @ 7:30 DESIRE UNDER THE BANYAN
PACIFIC FILM ARCHIVE, BERKELEY
I'll be reprising my 8-minute neo-benshi performance to a scene from
Guru Dutt's Pyaasa (1957) as part of a program that includes "an
experimental, cross-dressed reappropriation of the fabulous world of
Helen, Bollywood's dancing "it-girl" queen of the sixties and
seventies."

Best,
Rodney

Jason--
it turned out of course that James Frey made up a lot of his so called
"memoirs"
--got hell from Oprah, who had originally been pushing his book--
there's a whole slew of new memoirs of the Punk period that's been coming
out--
been reading them at bookstore--
just check out music section for them--
another memoir:: Peter Kropotkin--Memoirs of a Revolutionist
one of the great Anarchists
Beneath the Underdog--Charles Mingus

Returning to India byway of Sri Lanka at month's end.
My return Stateside is coming, for those I've been in
contact with, but still have things promised that I'd
better complete. Too, I plan to trek to Ladakh.

I would be interested in any news, writers, places,
whatever you might choose to blurt in my direction.

Has anyone seen the most recent Hillary Bust? Outside
whatever one's politics, I really like it!


Best,
AGJ

Steve,

Well, two or three of your poems were in Dirt #2. Looking through the my
e-mail archives, I don't think that you submitted to the most recent issue.
I'll be glad to see you contribute to #4. Just remember that Dirt is an
exclusively minimalist publication.

Check out Bob Avakian's memoir(as I'm sure some of you
know, he's the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist
Party, USA). It's called, From Ike to Mao and Beyond:
My Journey from Mainstream America to Revolutionary
Communist. Interesting read.

Best,
Joseph

Thanks for passing on recommendations for memoirs to read.

The answer, then, is the memoir is more imaginative and less factual than
autobiography.  Did anyone read Kenneth Rexroth's Autobiographical Novel?  That
jacket photo of him would break your heart, it is so sad and wise.

I have a real interest in genre lines because I think they create rules, and
rules create games, but I appreciate the problem that they are seen as mostly
there to create market niches.

I went to school (UH) just before the big wave of non-fiction writing and
personal essay had hit, but it was really true that as it was starting they were
pushing girls into it to keep poetry and fiction for themselves or girls were
trying to stay out of their way by writing nonfiction, and the men weren't
that foolish, ie., to tell the truth at book length or even in a single essay.
To write nonfiction was like a mortal duty and as grave.  It was like being
drafted.  It was delusional, too, because no one had asked them to do it.  There
was little sense as there is now that it could be a popular decision.  Anyone
working on long personal essay or booklength had seen ghosts.  They had the
crazy hair salad on their head.  I used to think poetry was the hardest to
write, and it is, in detail, but novel is the hardest to live through; memoir might
by worse.  I would need to enroll in a memoir course now to know what is
legal, especially names.  But they may not know.

I like stories about ordinary people.  I warm up to true ones, but if they
are labeled true, I expect them to stick to it.  The story of Courtney Love's
mother is one book out there today.  I looked at the pictures.  She was a hippy.

Mr. George Bowering:

Am still waiting for that response. And I got one hell
of a auto, as they say. Just looking for an old git
like you to give me some sobering advice, he said at
the internet bar in Hong Kong still serving drinks -
and most do - at midnight.

Has this been mentioned yet?

Poet's memoirs are in the news -- input "kinsella" in the google News search
engine.

They do these things differently in Australia.

Hi David,
That was my point about Frey, he shopped a million little pieces as a novel and got nowhere before he decided to tell people it was really a memoir so he could sell it because memoirs are HOT HOT HOT. Bad Novel became Bad Memoir. But for some reason, Oprah's book club loved it as a memoir even though it couldn't get anybody's attention when it was honestly fiction. I think the whole thing is instructive about sort of bullshit idea of authenticity that we seem to think is valuable, and we're willing to shell out for it when it's promised to us in something we would have no interest in were it not "authentic." A million little pieces then is like those "authentic reproductions" they sell of old coins on the home shopping channel, and I think to some extent all personal memoirs are like that.

I think my real beef with the form, now that i'm being forced to think about it, is that there are really two types of memoir, the personal and the social. The personal memoir is a person's memory of her experience and life. These are the kinds of memoirs i hate on principle, simply because i hate the idea of a person sitting down and saying "Damn, I'm important, I bet all sorts of people all really want to read about ME ME ME!" I'm not interested in reading about YOU YOU YOU, and even more so because YOU YOU YOU are arrogant enough to think YOU YOU YOU are so important that I I I should give a damn about your life experiences. I have my own life experiences to be bored by, thanks, I don't need to be bored by someone elses.

At the same time, I think there is a place for the social memoir, Henry Rollins "Get in the Van" about the early days of hardcore, John Lydon's about the beginning of punk, Marguerite Duras' "The War" about the French Resistance, Jim Tullies "Beggars of Life" or Jack Black's "You Can't Win" about hobo living in pre-war america. But those are stories about a person's involvement in a society and it's more the story of the society than it is of the person, and that, I think, is something reasonable to take one's subject.

I read the first edition of Rexroth's AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL -- if I remember
right, that title was at the insistence of the publisher, who was worried about
law suits -- hence the "novel"

The Art of War
Eyal Weizman

Eyal Weizman is an architect, writer and Director of Goldsmith’s College
Centre for Research Architecture. His work deals with issues of conflict
territories and human rights.

http://infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=20060801170800738

Intro:

"The Israeli Defence Forces have been heavily influenced by contemporary
philosophy, highlighting the fact that there is considerable overlap among
theoretical texts deemed essential by military academies and architectural
schools."

Exit:

"When the military talks theory to itself, it seems to be about changing its
organizational structure and hierarchies. When it invokes theory in
communications with the public – in lectures, broadcasts and publications –
it seems to be about projecting an image of a civilized and sophisticated
military. And when the military ‘talks’ (as every military does) to the
enemy, theory could be understood as a particularly intimidating weapon of
‘shock and awe’, the message being: ‘You will never even understand that
which kills you.’"

*Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 15th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It  hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.

*Fence
Fabulously non-wealthy founding editor Rebecca Wolff launched Fence in 1998=
,
with the invaluable aid of her beloved compatriots Caroline Crumpacker,
Jonathan Lethem, Frances Richard, and Matthew Rohrer. Max Winter signed up
soon after and has the distinction of being the only non-original editor
who's lasted more than a few years, so far. Read the history books: It's
been a long steady roll down the hill of institutional derangement. Fence
Books was launched in 2001 and continues to awe the caring populace with th=
e
genius it smacks between covers (French folds, at that). Support Fence!
Current editors include brilliances Lynne Tillman, Christopher Stackhouse,
Katy Lederer, and, last but far from least, Charles Valle, who keeps our
little picket boat afloat.

*Fungo Monographs is the publisher of "Seven Palms" by Kira Henehan, and
belongs to a series of one-shot publications published at random intervals
and inefficiently distributed. Jordan Davis has described Fungo Monographs
and the collective one-shot series as: "perhaps the most perverse concept o=
f
branding yet to emerge from poetryland's anti-business-model incubator..."

*Futurepoem publishes innovative prose, poetry and cross-genre literature b=
y
both emerging and underrepresented writers.  Our rotating editorial panel
shares the responsibility for selecting and helping to publicize the books
that we publish. Before submitting work, we recommend perusing our previous
titles as a good indication of the range of work that we like to publish.
For more information on publications and submission guidelines, visit
futurepoem.com and consider joining our mailing list.

*Hanging Loose is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. It is one of
the oldest small literary presses in the country. The name was inspired by
the format of the original magazine--mimeographed loose pages in a cover
envelope--and that, in turn, was inspired by a very low budget. Effective
with the 25th issue we abandoned that format to the relief of librarians an=
d
booksellers.
 =20
Early on, the Hanging Loose editors decided we were not interested in
begging poems from famous writers but in stressing work by new writers and
older writers whose work deserved a larger audience.
 =20
The editors are proud of having published many first books, including the
first full collections by Sherman Alexie, Kimiko Hahn, D. Nurkse, Jack
Ag=FCeros, Elinor Nauen, Joanna Fuhrman, Maggie Nelson, Indran Amirthanayagam=
,
and Beth Bosworth, among others. Some of the other writers published by HL
are Wilma Elizabeth McDaniel, Frances Phillips, Harvey Shapiro, Jayne
Cortez, Ron Overton, Helen Adam, Paul Violi, Charles North, Ha Jin, Morton
Marcus, Maureen Owen, Donna Brook, Yukihide Hartman, Jack Anderson and Ed
Friedman.

*Kitchen Press is a micro-press run out of Hell's Kitchen, NYC, and is a
member of CLMP. It's purpose is to publish quality handmade chapbooks by
emerging poets.=20

*Rachel Lipson is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who performs her simple,
honest songs on guitar (and sometimes ukulele and banjo). Born near Detroit=
,
MI, she spent her childhood building forts with her brother and sister in
the living room, contemplating the dangers of the dark and pizza deliverers=
,
riding horses and playing with friends. Rachel first picked up a guitar at
age 16 and a few years later, after having moved to New York, began craftin=
g
the songs that would make up her first album, This Way, which she
self-released the next year. In 2003 Rachel released a 7" with Rough Trade
recording artist Jeffrey Lewis, on Holland's Nowhere Fast record label and
self-released her second album Some More Songs. She toured Europe for seven
weeks with Lewis and Herman D=FCne in the summer, including the Mofo festival
in Paris in July. In the fall, Rachel recorded a new album at Olive Juice
Studios in New York for her latest release Pastures on Meccico Records, a U=
K
label founded and run by members of Cornershop. In the last few years,
Rachel has collaborated and performed extensively with Leah Hayes (of La
Laque and Scary Mansion), Herman D=FCne and others and has played alongside
Eugene Chadbourne, Kimya Dawson, Daniel Johnston, The Mountain Goats and
Refrigerator, as well as twice performing live on WFMU in New Jersey and on
WNYC, a division of NPR. Rachel Lipson's music combines a sort of radical
simplicity and honesty with intricately woven narratives. The lyrics seem t=
o
have as much to do with William Faulkner as they do with Woody Guthrie. The
music recalls the earliest folk traditions and yet speaks at the same time
to a contemporary minimal aesthetic. While sometimes the approach is
blindingly direct and at others masterfully oblique, the overall effect is
irresistible, one of invitingly gentle beauty and clarity.

*Lungfull! Magazine is the waterproof brainchild of editor Brendan Lorber.
Featuring an impeccably glossy cover and usually illustrated by Lorber's
drawings (which quite often include sketches of poets reading publicly), th=
e
magazine is unique in that it juxtaposes the first draft of a work with the
published version, and includes an extensive "working note" by writers. It'=
s
highly compelling to examine where a writer began with an idea, and how s/h=
e
took that idea into a finished poem. And the first drafts present an
enormous range: from scribbled drawings on napkins, to just-about-finished
typed poems that apparently sprang out full-blown, like Athena from the hea=
d
of Zeus. Contributors include Bill Berkson, Eileen Myles, Alice Notley, Wal=
t
Whitman, and Emily Dickinson.

*Open 24 Hours is dedicated to publishing limited edition books by poets
working in traditions rooted in experimentation and social engagement. The
Open 24 Hours design is influenced by the staple-bound mimeo revolution of
the American small press underground most visibly recognized in the books
published by many 2nd- and 3rd-generation New York School Poets. We have
simply adapted the method to digital technology.

Open 24 Hours has published books by Mariana Ruiz Firmat, Corina Copp, Bets=
y
Fagin, Joel Dailey, Chris Toll, and Steve Carey. Forthcoming are books by
Erica Kaufman, Arlo Quint, Will Yakulic, and Dustin Williamson.

Open 24 Hours is based in New York City, edited and designed by John Colett=
i
and Greg Fuchs. Jon Allen is our in-house illustrator. We took the name fro=
m
D.C. poet Buck Downs, who published a poetry zine by the same name. Downs
inherited Open 24 Hours from Baltimore poet Chris Toll, who started it in
1980.

*Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs endeavors to publish works that possess a
vitality and holistically consider emotional and political realms to say th=
e
least. Works that venture out beyond writing program platforms and communit=
y
expectations. Works that have substantiality in the way of vision.

*Sona Books, run out of Brooklyn, is a community-based chapbook press with =
a
corresponding web magazine, published about two times a year, at
www.sonaweb.net.  Sona Books publishes works that are quiet, risky,
experimental, collaborative, hybrid, and sometimes rough around the edges.
The press seeks ways to reach wide audiences and to teach non-poets about
so-called "difficult" poetries and prose works; to this end, the press runs
a subscription series, publishes bulletins entitled "how to read a Sona
Book," and encourages writers to publish process notes.  It's the goal of
Sona Books to stay small, to reach out to poets whose projects may be "unde=
r
the radar," to facilitate self-publishing exchanges among writers, and to
affirm generative relationships between editor and writer.

Dear Jason,
Some writers, memoirs or otherwise, are obnoxiously
arrogant about their experience. According to a
Rousseau specialist I took a course with, many people
never get past the first few pages of the Confessions
-- just out of principle, so put off were they by its
posturing. But, someone made a comment not long ago to
me that they didn't understand why others might not be
interested in personal experiences. It got me to
thinking. Here's what I think (arrogant me, perhaps,
who knows, I've been told), open for general
discussion:
I don't write about myself, and avoid autobiographical
content in my work. But I don't mind it in anybody
else's, and if I don't do it, it's because it bores
ME. I already went through all those Personal
Experiences, and don't need to write about them. But
lots of people lead very interesting lives -- I've
even met a few that have, by most standards -- and I'm
happy to read about them, if they're happy to write
(WELL!!!) about them.
If people are mentioning Rimbaud's Season as poetic
memoir, than I'll have to add Char's Feuillets
d'Hypnos, poems written in margins during the
Resistance, and Aime Cesaire too, why not....
While I'm at it, anyone know where I can find a cheap
copy of stuff by Paulin Gagne (in French)?
Yours,
Alex

I think my real beef with the form, now that i'm being
forced to think
about it, is that there are really two types of
memoir, the personal
and the social. The personal memoir is a person's
memory of her
experience and life. These are the kinds of memoirs i
hate on principle, simply
because i hate the idea of a person sitting down and
saying "Damn, I'm
important, I bet all sorts of people all really want
to read about ME
ME ME!" I'm not interested in reading about YOU YOU
YOU, and even more
so because YOU YOU YOU are arrogant enough to think
YOU YOU YOU are so
important that I I I should give a damn about your
life experiences. I
have my own life experiences to be bored by, thanks, I
don't need to be
bored by someone elses.

For my money, Andrew Lundwall is the best thing to come out of Wisconsin since Robin Yount & the Violent Femmes. He has four fab poems up at PFS Post (http://www.artrecess.blogspot.com). You can expect the Surreal, the "Beat", the exquisite, the "Language-y", and the word made live! Check it out...

Would it be harder to be a "mental" named Bogle or a freelance writer named
Quackenbush?  Highland is covering the porn angle.  Thurston is working on
legal aspects.

At the end of this month, Ottawa poet Stephen Brockwell & I are heading to
England & Wales where we're doing a couple of readings to help along my
poetry collection from England's Stride. This will be our second time
doing readings in that part of the world, after our Irish tour in 2002; we
hope to do the same next fall, six months after the release of my poetry
collection with Ireland's Salmon Publishing. Will we see some of you there?

September 1, 2006; 27 Museum Street, London WC1 (very close to The British
Museum). 7:30pm. Info: David Miller at katermurr_uk@yahoo.co.uk

Announcing the first trial of a new digital poetry device.

This is a beta, very rough version, for testing and exploration.

So I invite all poets to come and play, test and critique, writing their
own poems for this engine, or entering some of their old ones. The best
will be archived permanently. Again this is designed to help poets
think of their writing in a 3-d, multi-linear/dimensional way.

Please do offer thoughts on how it works, and it might be explained and
work better.

Cheers, Jason Nelson

I just tried out Jason Nelson's "poetry cube." A couple of nights
ago, I participated in Quick Muse's new 15-minute write-a-thon. The
idea is that you are given a quotation and asked to respond with a
poem. All your keystrokes are recorded & can later be played back via
"poematic," a "poem recording and playback" system devised by
Fletcher Moore;  there is also a separate file of the "final" poem.
Results at http://www.quickmuse.com .

I Wear a Figleaf Over My Penis: Poems by Geoffrey Gatza
	=09
by Peter Conners

Blaze Vox Books, 2005
By Peter Conners=20

There is a strange and ambiguous phrase often referred to as a Chinese
curse, but in truth an American creation given a Confucian back-story to =
add
wisdom and gravity to the deeper rooting in irony from which the =
sentiment
stems: =93May you live in interesting times.=94 Geoffrey Gatza=97without =
bothering
to note its negative connotations or bastard origins=97uses this curse =
as the
epigraph to his poetry collection, I Wear a Figleaf Over My Penis, which =
is
appropriate; nothing in Gatza=92s world is as it seems. Buffalo=92s own =
Gatza
doesn=92t write about interesting times; Gatza=92s writing is =
interesting times.
In this collection, comic titles such as =93Our Lady of Perpetual =
Chicken
McNuggets=AE=94 nestle next to opaque poetic statements such as =93Truth
languishes in jail, convicted of orchestrating/the murder of the =
daughter of
time. Life is purring/over something that doesn=92t want you, or your =
cow.=94
But Gatza does want your cow. And your =93Mouse Deer.=94 And your =
=93Quilted
Giraffe.=94 And your =93Mastodons of Macedonia.=94 But mainly, he wants =
to write
about dragons and heroes and the ways mythology and meditation lose out =
to
Wal-Mart, Starbucks and war all the time. Gatza=92s poetry is in =
constant
motion between politics and the politics of passivity; surrealism and
flat-out absurdity; romantic parables and animal stories for twisted
children=97the =93interesting times=94 are present everywhere, and they =
are always
both positive and negative. In =93The Cats of Baghdad,=94 when Gatza =
writes,
=93With the poor people of this earth, I want to share my fate=94 you =
believe
the poet because he has proven himself to have shrapnel and flowers in =
his
eyes. When he writes, =93There is no such thing as free kittens=94 at =
the end of
the same poem, you better believe that, too.

"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive.
Everything is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's
body. Writing is not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has,
that exists to one side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another
person who appears and comes forward, invisible, gifted with thought
and anger, and who sometimes, through her own actions, risks losing
her life. Into the night." -- Marguerite Duras

Since this thread still seems to be going...An example -- speaking of memoir
and veiling and unveiling -- just this morning started a new book by Thomas
Heise, _Horror Vacui_ -- the title in itself speaks volumes for memoir-like
poetry --  -- similar in ways to Anna Swir's movements of veiling and
unveiling the body, her thighs, her ribcage -- an interesting
self-dismemberment in her poems

(Tho The Motorcycle Diaries some of the most interesting of memoir I've
*ever seen and plann to read)

I don't know if copyright allows quoting a whole Heise poem online, but here
are the opening lines of

My Pieta

He held me high with the bellows
to smoke the beehive, hanging delicate

Someone recently requested suggestions for poetry and/or literature anthologies that were better than Norton, et al, which I thought I'd saved but can't find. Could that person please repost the end results? I believe there was a top 3 list.

(And can someone please tell me where/how to search the archives--I can't remember.)

Organic Furniture Cellar, my first full-length book, is available from
Outside Voices (www.outsidevoices.org) for $16, and will soon be available
through SPD.  You can view blurbs, reviews, and excerpts at the press
website.  Thanks for your time.  - Jessica

What others have to say about Organic Furniture Cellar
The blurbs:
These poetic constellations are places to inhabit and shifting possibilitie=
s
for meaning. Jessica Smith rounds every corner with another corner. Organic
Furniture Cellar is the future in a now.
- Charles Bernstein

Jessica Smith's Organic Furniture Cellar takes on big issues, such as how t=
o
write about the place where you live with all its distractions, beauties,
and limitations intact. And she writes out of these questions a beautifully
fragmented series of page aware poems. A stunning and necessary first book.
- Juliana Spahr

Jessica Smith refuses to write like lyric poets, who merely rearrange the
furniture of language in their rooms; instead, she makes her language skid
'every which way' like an office chair kicked across a parquet floor.
- Christian B=F6k

Excerpts from the reviews thus far:
"Each page of Organic Furniture Cellar is a physical space which the reader
and the text occupy by turns troubling each other by their very
proximity.... The fragment as a textual event, as a means of troubling
meaning, does not necessarily suggest, as Jessica Smith argues, a
destructive act =AD it can point to the deferral of the accumulation of large=
r
narratives.

"These splinters do not imply =B3a =8Cwhole=B9 that has been fragmented, but
rather pieces that do not necessarily or instantly refer to a whole;
furthermore, there is no implied =8Cbreaking=B9 into fragments. The fragments
may reveal the page=B9s topology, but they have not =8Cfallen=B9 apart from any
pure, unified, original state.=B2

"Freeing meaning from traditional anchors.. Smith works to defer unified,
monolithic meanings and create articulate spaces for voice, history and
gender."
- derek beaulieu

"Jessica Smith's "Organic Furniture Cellar" is a
choose-your-own-poetry-adventure. Readers are challenged to set aside their
commitment to linear, left to right, top down reading and invited to
(re)arrange texts of their own choosing. Words fan out across the pages in
clusters, sometimes trailing letters behind, creating tracks of meaning
chosen, by chance and desire, by the reader.

"The poems take their titles from places -- cities, streets, geographical
landmarks -- sites of personal history, marking events which the reader
co-authors through an ordering of language. Smith reminds us that memory is
unordered and agile. The reader creates fragments of stories brought to min=
d
by sense experiences. We piece together narrative lines through the collage
of memory. Memory burrows its own winding path of logic. This path exists,
sometimes invisibly, beneath a surface of conventional rules of reading. As
the reader steps into the role of co-creator, she carves her own paths of
meaning, collecting bits of language and assembling them into images of
story. This invitation to playful participation becomes a mandate as it
becomes more and more difficult to find meaning reading in a left to right
trajectory."
- Ellen Baxt

I was awfully unemployed this summer, but as of next week, I'll be working at
a Hallmark gift shop in my neighborhood called Maggie's Hallmark.  I get to
wear a navy blue apron over white blouse and khaki pants.  Really!  I'll be
working at 1986 wages, too ($7.75/hr), but I shall try not to suffer over it (any
anecdotes, see blog).

Really very good news came in the mail today:  my copy of Vernon Frazer's
IMPROVISATIONS, which I've just started on.  Kudos to Vernon.

And an interesting title from Starcherone Books called PP/FF edited by Peter
Conners.  These are terrific short pieces that fall somewhere between prose
poems and flash fiction.  PP/FF may well come to signal the gray area in very
short writings.

Interesting comparison. Jason's and Fletcher's are similar in their inviting
people to write something relatively short. And similar also in that the
tools they create strongly influence the form, content, and presentation of
the writing. But other than that, they're quite different from one another,
it seems.

I've seen a couple of other attempts at using a graphic of an open book in
digital work. The best other example that comes to mind is Myst. The writing
was in a script font. Which was a bit fey. And the writing was at a
youngster-TV level, which usually goes along with the demographic for
computer games. But the graphics, puzzles, and videos contained in the books
were pretty cool. And the idea of book as portal amongst worlds was
uncommonly well-realized. As was the notion of the main character as a
writer, a writer of worlds and books.

Fletcher's work is remarkable also, really, in its graphical appeal, its
readability, its fresh quality, and also in its ingenious incorporation of
various technologies into a public and participatory poetical format rather
unsuspectingly contained in 'an old book'.

Jason's work is less concerned with dragging notions of print into the
piece, and it is disjunctive in its 3D display of the lines--they don't
appear in the same order as what you write.

There are of course many pieces on the Web in which you are invited to write
something that becomes part of the piece or site. There is a great range of
form and content possible here, from the 'participatory poem' to the 'auto
journal' as publishing, participation, and the web app (the literary
machine) develop.

Hi All,

The small press scheduled for our levy lives series on Thurs. Sept. 14, 200=
6
unfortunately had to cancel. If your press is game to take this slot--read
our invite letter below for more information--please email me asap.

thanks,

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I'm the editor and publisher of Boog City, a New
York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its 16th year.
I'd like to invite you to take part in year four of our "d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press" series.

The series is held at Chelsea's ACA Galleries (http://acagalleries.com/),
which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik.
It's a nice space, and we fit 100 people, including a 9-piece jazz flash
orchestra, in it for Chax Press's event, with plenty of room to spare. The
gallery provides wine and other beverages, and cheese and crackers and
hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different visiting press host and feature three or
more of their authors to read (we've had as many as 10 for one press and
usually have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a musical act perform
two 15-20 minute sets. If the visiting press is able to book a musical act
that's preferred, so it's truly their night, if not I can book one that I
think will work well with the night.

We started the series in August 2004. In our first three seasons we've
hosted:

(locations are at the time of the event)

--Meritage Press (San Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.)
--The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.)
--Tougher Disguises (Oakland, Calif.)

"exquisite collage or andre going solo":
http://nurotus.blogspot.com/2006/07/exquisite-collage-or-andre-going-solo.ht
ml
by Marko Niemi (Finland)

Marko Niemi is a poet programmer. The above is a cut-up-related DHTML piece
that works with texts by Andre Breton. Move the mouse around on the piece
and occassionally click.

If you put the cursor over the piece, right-click, and select 'View Source',
you see the neath-text, the program and the Breton texts he's working with.

I found this piece sufficiently intriguing that I read the texts in the
neath-text, read the programming in the neath-text and googled some of the
primary texts to see who wrote them (Breton, as mentioned) and read about
Breton on various googled pages.

Marko's work as a poet-programmer is sophisticated and unique in its
programming but simple and dramatic in its textual transformations. The
'look' of the above piece is catchy. As you move the mouse over the piece,
you see a process that you probably haven't seen before. I hadn't, anyway.
And though the process at first seems mysterious, it is sufficiently
intriguing and simple that it doesn't take long to figure out exactly what
is going on--perhaps even if you don't read the programming. In a lot of
digital processual-work, you have no idea what the process is and the text
being produced is gibberish.

Marko also does considerable translation work from English into Finnish. He
translated some of my DHTML work into Finnish--but, additionally, he made
some changes to the programming which allows his translations to run on more
browsers and platforms than my 1997-99 programming did. So I took the code
from his translations and updated the English versions with his code. The
sort of work he did on those translations--not only translation but
perspicuous upgrading of the programming to contemporary standards--is very
unusual. He is fully engaged in his own work as a poet-programmer, and is
one of the world's few translators of poetry who also has the chops to work
on the programming.

Final call, book length submissions due with a Tuesday 8/15 postmark, thanks

    The Annual Transcontinental Poetry Award by Pavement Saw Press

  All contributors receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee.
  Please mention this to your friends, students and others who might be interested!

  Each year Pavement Saw Press will seek to publish at least one book of poetry and/or prose poems from manuscripts received during this competition. Selection is made anonymously through a competition that is open to anyone who has not previously published a volume of poetry or prose. The author receives $1000 and a percentage of the press run. Previous judges have included Judith Vollmer, David Bromige, Bin Ramke and Howard McCord. All poems must be original, all prose must be original, fiction or translations are not acceptable. Writers who have had volumes of poetry and/or prose under 40 pages printed or printed in limited editions of no more than 500 copies are eligible. Submissions are accepted during the months of June, July, and until August 15th. All submissions must have an August 15th, 2006, or earlier, postmark. This is an award for first books only.

  Entries must meet these requirements:

  1. The manuscript should be at least 48 pages of poetry and no more than 70 pages of poetry in length. Separations between sections are not a part of the page count.

  2. A one page cover letter which includes a brief biography, the book's title, your name, address, and telephone number, your signature, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address. This should be followed by a page which lists publication acknowledgments for the book. For each acknowledgement mention the publisher (journal, anthology, chapbook etc.) and the poem published.

  3. The manuscript should be bound with a single clip and begin with a title page including the book's title, your name, address, and telephone number, and, if you have e-mail, your e-mail address.

  4. The second page should have only the title of the manuscript. There are to be no acknowledgments or mention of the author's name from this page forward. Submissions to the contest are judged anonymously.

  5. The manuscript should be paginated, beginning with the first page of poetry.

  6. There should be no more than one poem on each page. The manuscript can contain pieces that are longer than one page.

  Your manuscript should be accompanied by a check in the amount of $18.00 made payable to Pavement Saw Press. All US contributors to the contest will receive books, chapbooks and journals equal to, or more than, the entry fee. Add $3 (US) for other countries to cover the extra postal charge. Do not include an SASE for notification of results, this information will be sent with the free book. While the judge will choose the prize winner, sometimes another anonymous manuscript is chosen by the editor, if enough entries arrive. This “editors choice” manuscript will be published under a standard royalty contract. A decision will be reached in November. Do not send the only copy of your work. All manuscripts will be recycled and individual comments on the manuscripts cannot be made. Entries should be sent to:

_________________________________________________

Uncle  LD Beghtol is the leader of orchpop collective Flare, one half of the
willfully obscure
bicoastal experimental duo, Moth Wranglers, and  approximately one third of
The Three
Terrors (with Stephin Merritt and Dudley  Klute). (He can also be seen
singing in
Magnetic Fields from time to time,  appearing quite a bit on '69 Love Songs').
His latest album, LD & The New  Criticism recently came out on Darla.

"Beghtol bends his baroque goth-pop  westward in the new band's autotelic
debut, Tragic Realism is a gory,  uke-joint country (think Haggard ca. '68 via
Lovecraft and horror flix),  backwoods folk-gospel raveup sure to bring a
Zoloft
smile to your face, and  often." -- VILLAGE VOICE.

So L'il is Frances Sorensen & Ben Malkin, all  harmonies, go-go percussion,
waves wash over you melodic juno, rhythmic wings  of strummed gibson, at
times swing,
at times drone, shine-a-light-on simple  ambient pop with the cracked eye
lyrics
of cut-up inside (light shining  through the cracks of somewhere behind). In
the
last four years So L'il has  released a 6-song self-titled EP, one split
7-inch
with the band Timesbold  (both on Neko Records), the full-length 'Revolution
Thumpin', and their most  recent full-length, 'Dear Kathy,' both on Goodbye
Better. They are currently  at work on a new EP.

CAConrad's childhood included selling cut flowers  along the highway for his
mother and helping her shoplift. He escaped to  Philadelphia the first chance
he
got, where he lives and writes today with  the PhillySound poets. He coedits
FREQUENCY
Audio Journal with Magdalena  Zurawski, and edits the 9for9 project. Soft
Skull Press
is publishing his  first book of poems titled Deviant Propulsion, available
in Fall
of 2005. His  book The Frank Poems is forthcoming from The Jargon Society. He
is
the  author of several chapbooks, including (end-begin w/chants), a

I Feel Tractor.  Eddie Berrigan is a New York  poet and musician who performs
under the name of I Feel Tractor. His songs are  playful retakes of
traditional folk and country genres
& their subtle,  funny lyrics and far-flung imagery create unusual landscapes
of both physical  and emotional territory. The author of the poetry
collection Disarming Matter  (1999, Owl Press) and several chapbooks, Eddie as I Feel
Tractor released a  self-titled 7-inch last year (Loudmouth Collective) and
just last month released  it's first full-length recording, 'Once I Had An
Earthquake', on Goodbye Better.

A question to Listers:

If a poem contains a product description, then how
does one indicate this. For example, I have a poem
that contains a description from an old clothing
catalog of a specific coat the speaker in the poem is
wearing, and which adds a kind of film noir quality to
the piece.

Your time's appreciated,
AGJ

My thought is that you should read at the second place more often than
the first place.

All of the readers who didn't do promotional work read gratis in exchange for getting their art products aggressively promoted for a month by the women who curated and to help us get our thing off the ground.

The Women who curated has always paid artists for their work. Ask anyone who has  read for her--we asked for the help of the readers to get our series going.

And I believe I have  read for skyplum gratis

hi steve and all,

i've been curating events and getting paid to read for the past 15 years.
one of the main things i try to do at events i put on is to inform
performers of the economics of the nights. for our non-nyc small press
series i let the press editors know that i don't charge a door so we can get
them more exposure. we have a table for them to sell their offerings, and
they keep 100% of their sales.

when i do events with musical acts at different clubs i charge a door. every
club does the door differently, with some taking a certain number of doors
who enter, say first three paid per hour of a show; while others take
anywhere from 25%-50% of the door, depending upon their policy and your
track record at the venue. still another took the first $200 off the door to
pay the door person and the sound person, then another 10% of the remainder
as a club charge, before giving us the remainder.

with some shows, for example when we did a benefit for sean cole's december
project book about two years ago where we performed Pink Floyd's The Wall
live, all of the money we raised went toward printing sean's book.

with other shows, where i usually have 2-3 poets open up and anywhere from
5-13 musical acts perform an album live, i count the total number of
performers (so a solo act doesn't get the same as a five-piece band) and
performances (so if one performer plays with two different acts they get
paid twice), take my cut for putting on the show (anywhere from 30%-50%) and
then divide that remaining figure by the number of performances. i then
adjust that figure so the numbers are as round as they can be.

also, before any money is doled out, if the club is able to record an event
off their board we pay them for that, and since all the musical act's share
a common backline, some musicians' at times fill out the backline with an
amp or drums depending upon the need. for them i take their r/t cab fare off
the top. and with these shows, too, the performers are welcome to sell any
of their own product and keep 100% of the proceeds.

when i'm reading, if i'm not told or already know how it works at the venue,
i ask the curator. most times it's for free and on occasion there are a few
dollars involved.

what it sounds like from your email steve is that you didn't get things
straight with your curators, be it before, during, or after yr shows, and so
ended up happier on one end than the other.

best,
david

It's always nice to get paid for giving a reading.  Obviously there should be more readings that pay the readers.  Still, are any of us ready to start turning down readings where we don't get paid?  I don't think so.  Though I heard a rumor about a recently dead poet who just before he died decided to accept only readings that came with payment so it has happened.  Still, I tend to take whatever readings are offered me and look upon it as a pleasant plus when I make some money.  Selling one's books is always an option if one obsesses enough about it.

I am running behind on a compilation list of "Notable Books" for the
past year or two: just too many to ever get to the end. Well, maybe
September. For the moment, I have posted short reviews of (mostly not
so new) books by Gil Sorrentino, Ko Un, Colin Browne, Robert Kelly, &
Vito Acconci at http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog

& in the meantime just got an advance copy of *Girly Man*, which will
be out from the University of Chicago press in about a month.

steve--
look at it this way--in two nights you read a total of 18 minutes and earned
$50.00
on top of that you sold bunch of books and cds--
heard free music and am sure had yr beverages free

basically you were being paid abt $2.70/minute--
or--abt $162/hour
plus the sales of the cds, books and the perks of free music etc--

you'd have to work over twenty hours at a factory job at $10.00/hr minus the
taxes--
to earn that much--with no free music and free drinks either--

and lot more hours than that if you were making minimum wage--

heck, i get 70 dollars a week from SSI-from three spinal fusions---and
fourteen goes right away to bus pass
i.e. $56.00/week!

my friend, sometimes it helps to put things in perspective
being a poet, an artist--a rough life,sure-
but on other hand a lot of fun and endlessly interesting--
most people don't have that--
they got to work at hard jobs they don't like and takes a day or more to
make what you got for 18 minutes, not counting the sales of your wares--and
yr name in lights--so to speak--listed in the paper and elists etc and
having audience too--
and then being able to complain about it in the bargain!
i wd say in a way you have it made!
lighten up and take stock
you are leading the life you WANT to have, right , not the life you HAVE to
have or are FORCED to have
you can't put a price on that--

and also--as was pointed out--the workers at a place where you read put in
long hours and get paid very far less--money from the door doesn't go very
far when goes into paying workers and overhead etc--

so hey--enjoy the life of a poet!--and have some laughs abt al the stranage
scenes and deals one gets to be part of--
as a book i have here studying says:  "Sure Beats Sittin in a Cell"!!
take it easy but take it as woody guthrie wd say--

After expenses, e.g., transportation and meals, $50 is more than I've gotten
for any reading I've ever done in my life. Most of the time I get no pay at
all, not even the door. And sometimes I don't even sell a book! Bottom line,
at the venue you're unhappy with you made out way better than I did at the
Poetry Project last September, or at any other time in my life.

Vernon,

The Poetry Project pays more than $50,00 a reading.

David,

What about all the time it took one to write the poems? Of course, the writing of the poems can be considered a consumption, a play, rather than a production -then, you are being paid all this money to have a good time -which I think is  basically what you are saying.

Ciao

Murat

I know that. But I traveled from Hartford, CT to do the reading. It was a 6-
hour round trip, took a full tank of gas at 2005 prices, numerous tolls, and
two meals on the road. Moreover,  I treated my "reading assistants" to
dinner with my $150 fee because that was about the only way that I could pay
them for their time and trouble. So, over all, I probably spent $50 more
than I earned that day to do the reading. If I lived in New York, it would
be a very nice pay day. I certainly have no complaints about the way the
Poetry Project treats me; it's one of the most professional, supportive
venues I've ever performed in.

This is my second post to the List. If you want to discuss this further, you

One of my poet friends is a triple zillionaire (there are those).  He
accepted "a small honorarium" of $1,500 to read at his alma mater.  Granted, he reads
as well as the best of them.  Still, my rate is about $50, same alma mater.
I caused two fiction audiences to laugh straight through two different short
stories on two far-flung occasions.  Since I had never attended such a funny
fiction reading myself, I was caught off guard.  I thought these stories were
very earnest and sincere and even sad, so I read them straight, while the
audiences came at me in syncopated laughter waves that lasted 30 minutes.  Fiction
that makes you laugh straight through, not just once or twice, deserves the
same fee my friend (a mellow intoner) gets, but how likely is it?  I was paid $50
for one of the readings (without incurring related expenses); for the other,
I needed to buy a plane ticket and meals.  It would be impossible to say that
I regret doing the reading at Ruthless Grip, which is as that curator had
predicted: no one ever had said s/he regretted it.

In 2001, to date my latest go at readings, it was my turn for a featured in
St. Paul, a $50 deal, but I couldn't FIND the cafe where the reading was to
take place.  I probably owe them money because I wasn't there and had made such a
fuss about how it had to be a featured, etc.  I felt like Arthur Craven, a
no-show.  Then I got uppity further thinking what if I had done "a dry run" and
driven there twice, given the reading, and then only earned $50.

Major readings at a synagogue four miles from my house (Roth, Atwood, Oates,
Alice Munro, Russell Banks and others) cost $24 at the door.  I'm in favor of
charging for it, but I couldn't personally afford to go to those readings,
alas.

Sounds to me that if you're concerned about the money you make for
reading then you need to market yourself better, do fewer readings
just for the sake of reading & set up solo gigs for yourself & your
own projects.  Have a show that people want to see & make em pay to
see it.  Play the grants game, play the art world game, play the
university circuit game & most likely with a bit of persistence you
can make some real world money.  Otherwise you should just relish
being part of a vibrant local independent performance scene that is
readily accessible & diverse & make your money doing something
else.   Given the opportunity I'd chose the later without hesitation.

Hello all,
The SUNY Buffalo English Dept. will be hosting a
conference on Robert Creeley from Oct. 12th to the
14th, which will feature readings and papers from a
rather astonishing list of poets and critics. All the
details can be found at the website below.

http://www.english.buffalo.edu/OnWords.htm

The website will be updated as new information is made
available. This conference has been made possible in
large part through the dedication and sweat of Steve
McCaffery and Karen Mac Cormack. We hope you can join
us.

In touch.
-Matt

A few years ago, I had this plan to attend as many small venue readings as I
could, just to understand what talent was like in the Twin Cities.  So far,
when I had gone out to hear a reading, everything was great: the poets were
really good, they were more-than-average performance-oriented, they were nice
people, an open mic I went to here was the best I'd ever seen, all true, but there
were too few just plain audience members, people not reading, so I wanted to
be one of those, someone listening, not reading, or mostly not reading,
because I had done that for theater and for rock 'n roll, also in smaller venues,
and really had fun, even though I was not in the performance, not even
reviewing, and was more like a pure fan.  I would still like to do something like that
again for poetry (as we did in Binghamton with the Binghamton Community
Poets), if not here, then in another place.

And you're right: the BCP, for example, all had day jobs, and what did any of
us actually care about money then?  We had great nights.  That outfit hired a
heckler (great bulbous-nosed George) to howl and lament from the bar apropos
of nothing or something the poets were howling or lamenting in the next room.
They were a troupe with a sizable, loyal audience.

Nor could I afford to go to a reading in which I had to pay for transportation. In recent years,  I've done this only once, for a reading in Philadelphia to which I took a cheap bus.  The ride was with some close friends of mine who were also reading.  I read mostly in NYC where I live.  I would like to read more outside NYC but wouldn't know how to handle the transportation costs if they weren't covered by the hosting organization or person.So I guess some sort of payment, even a roundtrip ticket, would be necessary in such a situation. There was an instance, almost twenty years ago where I was invited to read in Nicaragua at something called the Ruben Dario Poetry Festival.  Fortunately, one of my parents was still alive then and she covered the air fare to and from Managua. I made this exception because I was interested in seeing what a Communist country looked and felt like but had never been to one before this occasion.

AMBogle2@AOL.COM wrote:  One of my poet friends is a triple zillionaire (there are those). He
accepted "a small honorarium" of $1,500 to read at his alma mater. Granted, he reads
as well as the best of them. Still, my rate is about $50, same alma mater.
I caused two fiction audiences to laugh straight through two different short
stories on two far-flung occasions. Since I had never attended such a funny
fiction reading myself, I was caught off guard. I thought these stories were
very earnest and sincere and even sad, so I read them straight, while the
audiences came at me in syncopated laughter waves that lasted 30 minutes. Fiction
that makes you laugh straight through, not just once or twice, deserves the
same fee my friend (a mellow intoner) gets, but how likely is it? I was paid $50
for one of the readings (without incurring related expenses); for the other,
I needed to buy a plane ticket and meals. It would be impossible to say that
I regret doing the reading at Ruthless Grip, which is as that curator had
predicted: no one ever had said s/he regretted it.

In 2001, to date my latest go at readings, it was my turn for a featured in
St. Paul, a $50 deal, but I couldn't FIND the cafe where the reading was to
take place. I probably owe them money because I wasn't there and had made such a
fuss about how it had to be a featured, etc. I felt like Arthur Craven, a
no-show. Then I got uppity further thinking what if I had done "a dry run" and
driven there twice, given the reading, and then only earned $50.

Major readings at a synagogue four miles from my house (Roth, Atwood, Oates,
Alice Munro, Russell Banks and others) cost $24 at the door. I'm in favor of
charging for it, but I couldn't personally afford to go to those readings,
alas.

Self-published a really nice, or so was told, chapbook
few years back - received some nice words (blurbs and
support) from noted poets and authors. Worked with
some other creative people on the design, included
some really clever tricks, I'll say. But then, plop -
it didn't go anywhere, because while I had the 'golden
ears' of some, most hadn't even heard a peep of what
might've been coming from my direction. It led me to
almost stop writing, my expectations so completely
naive and me becoming cynical. Well, I've got
something just about completed, or so I think, and am
wondering if the braintrust of this group might be
able to shoot me up with some good advice and all out
suggestions.

It's like if you didn't hear the tree, then did it
actually fall kinda thing.

Do you maintain and frequently update a mailing list? That's the crucial, I
think, both for self-publishers and micro-publishers. Also consider using
Lulu for POD.

It seems like a detail that has been overlooked is that the woman who
curated got 70% of the door, which means that the venue already took their
cut and their expenses were covered.  So the question is why wouldn't she
share a little of the loot?  Did she actually spend $100 on advertising the
event or on some other hidden expense?

I've curated quite a few one-off events and festivals (not so much regular
reading series) and I've rarely done events in which the poets and
performers didn't get paid something, even if it was just a couple of
dollars or free drinks. (The only exception was a two-day festival in which
I was only given $200 to produce the event, had over 40 acts, and I spent
two months working on the event and had to be there every minute of the
weekend performances myself. So I kept that one for myself due to the level
of work on my part.)  As a curator or producer, I feel that it's important
to pay people for their work and I always regret that I can't pay them more.


I think when people pay a cover at the door, they do assume that the
readers/presenters/performers are getting paid something out of that and I
think that as one of the readers, I would expect it as well.  I certainly
don't begrudge the curator taking a respectable share for their work, which
is generally more work (for that particular event) than any of the
individual readers, but without them, there's no event, is there?

As for the labor of writing, once the poem is written, it can be read and
performed over and over, as well as published (in which again, we rarely get
paid).  So if there is a cost-benefit analysis here on your labor vs. your
wages, then I guess it depends on how much "airtime" you're able to get each
poem--how often you can get booked to read at $5 or $10 or $50 a show.

And finally . . .  I do consider sales to be part of my "pay" for an event,
so that you were able to sell some things at each show does seem to be a
significant part of the compensation.

I'm interested in how quickly everyone jumps on the bandwagon of how poets
rarely get paid and shouldn't expect it and should appreciate it when we do.
I'm not chastising anyone for this, but it does say a lot about how we see
the (monetary) value of what we do, n'est pas?  I know very few musicians
who would stand still for that.  They *expect* to get paid, and maybe we
should too.

I agree that it's important to keep poetry outside of the idea of a "market
value" and that some things should operate outside of a money economy.  On
the other hand, we do work hard and we do live inside of a capitalist
economy and have rent and have to pay for food and paper and pens and books
and transportation and there are only so many hours in the day to create
*and* earn a living and only so much energy and not everyone can get a
grant, so . . . is it wrong of us to demand that people share the "wealth"
with us?

As one person said, I guess, make sure the arrangements are clear up front
and you understand why the door isn't being shared, if if's an issue for
you.  I understand you feeling a bit taken advantage of.

perhaps not, but he (steve in this case) did not make a demand up front. if
he did, there is the possibility that another poet more than happy to read
for free would take his place.

David's right.  You simply find out ahead of time about what the gig
entails and the payment and then decide to take it or not.

Poets should discourage the idea of giving it away.  Exceptions would be
benefits, doing a friend a favor etc.

****If you're going to read for free, do it for your local library.

A bookstore or bar is NOT doing you a favor to let you be an attraction
for them to bring in paying customers--that should be a reciprocally
beneficial deal for which you are paid.  We need to teach the world to
stop thinking of poetry as a pro bono art form.

Wow, this is a topic that really gets under my skin!

On poets and poetry readings I've had all kinds of experience,
as it's clear many of you also have.  There's a reading series
in Philadelphia with government funding which has a truly
fucked up way of paying.  The poet receives a check for $30,
and that's the payment, period.  They also charge $5 at the
door, but the poet doesn't get ANY of that money.  If only
two poets show up the $30 is great.  But there's no incentive
to get fifty people in the audience if you still wind up with your
$30 check and nothing else.  Not only that it would and frankly
SHOULD piss off any poet to go through the trouble of bringing
in a big crowd and watch the curator walk off with all the loot!

Frank Sherlock has one of the most generous attitudes I've
ever encountered in Philadelphia.  At his NIGHT FLAG series
he suggests a $5 donation, and ALL the money goes to
the poets.  That's remarkable.  It's also almost unheard  of!

Examples of how selfish both poets and curators can be are
endless.  And it's the kind of conversation that only drags us
down to where poetry can begin to feel ugly.

I've been ASTONISHED more than once by curators who
take off with all or most of the door, or take the drink tickets
from the bar owner and share them with their friends instead
of the poets who were giving up their time and stamina on
the stage.  Selfishness is one of those things I judge hardest
on all poets.  Whenever I find a selfish poet their poems had
better be FUCKING amazing for me to even consider reading
them, or hearing them read.  Selfishness is a big thing to
overcome, as it should be.  Poetry is something that should
bring out generosity, but every once in a while I realize that
there are some pricks in the world who will stop at nothing to
take what they clearly must realize doesn't belong to them.

I'm not saying that everyone running a poetry series should be
as generous as Frank Sherlock, but he's certainly a high water
mark to measure yourself against.

"It seems like a detail that has been overlooked is that the woman who
curated got 70% of the door, which means that the venue already took their
cut and their expenses were covered. So the question is why wouldn't she
share a little of the loot? Did she actually spend $100 on advertising the
event or on some other hidden expense?"

I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Bowery
sometimes collects a certain fee for slots taken, regardless of how many
people attend.  The curator pays the sum and hopes to get it back by
investing even more time and money into advertising.

Seems to me if you go into a reading knowing you haven't been told you're
getting paid, then you've agreed to read for free.  That said, I did a
reading Steve curated once and was pleasantly surprised when he passed a hat
and split the collection among the readers.  This was totally unexpected and
a perk, and I was grateful.  I was also grateful to read when I didn't think
I would make some moolah.

Some folks are quite selective in their readings because they want to make
money and/or want to cultivate being a 'name brand' poet.  A few of those
folks will eventually make the 'big bucks' when it comes to reading -- but
even fewer will make a living at it.  Me, I'm grateful when invited and
money really only becomes a consideration if the person doing the inviting
brings it up or if the location requires travel.

Hi All =AD My friend, Hilton Obenzinger (poet, scholar, novelist),
occasionally writes meditations on politics and events of which this one I
found not comforting but as balanced with clarity as I imagine that one can
get in this current madness. (When will madness not be current?).

Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies - 12
=20
Hilton Obenzinger
=20
I write these meditations from time to time in an attempt to stay
sane.  If you find them tedious, apply the magic of delete.  If you want to
share them with others, feel free to do so.
------------------
 =20
Adding Up the Score
=20
August 14, 2006

Now that there=92s a cease-fire in the works, let us count up the war crimes.
=20
Hezbollah manages to toss unguided rockets randomly at civilian targets,
blood-letting for no strategic reason.  I suppose the attempt to demoralize
the population counts for something =96 a little satisfaction that at least
the Israeli population should feel some pain =96 could count for a kind of
political-military accomplishment.  Still, there=92s no doubt that hurling
weapons randomly at civilians is criminal =96 not to mention the fact that
close to 40 percent of the victims were Arab citizens of Israel.
=20
On the other hand, Israel does it with precision.  Precision guided laser
bombs, precision rockets that hit pinpoint targets, plus the good manners t=
o
send leaflets telling people that they need to flee.  So, precision weapons
hit civilian apartment buildings, precisely blast UN outposts, precisely hi=
t
marked ambulances, precisely blow up humanitarian convoys, and precisely
kill the very civilians they had told to flee.  Hezbollah hides among
civilians, goes the Israeli rationale, which may be at least partially true=
,
in so much as the militia is completely intertwined with the civilian
population.  Even so, precision targeting of civilian targets =96 the
destruction of Lebanon=92s infrastructure, for one thing =96 is a war crime.
=20
By quantity and quality, I would say Israel wins this competition hands
down.
=20
And who won the war?  It=92s easier to say who lost.
=20
Israel lost because it finally could not get its unilateral way through
military force.   The goal was to destroy Hezbollah, and they discovered th=
e
toughest, best trained, best equipped fighters they have ever encountered.
The goal then shifted to pushing Hezbollah away from the South.  Then Shimo=
n
Peres appeared on American TV to say that, since Israel didn=92t start the
war, all Israel had to do was to stop it to win.  Nope, Israel lost.  It
wasn=92t a loss that meant =93the Jews will be pushed into the sea,=94 etc., etc.=
,
but it was a loss nonetheless.  This could be the best thing to come out of
the miserable mess.  Israelis may decide to re-think aggression as policy
and turn to actual negotiations.  They can start with the Palestinians.
Maybe, but I=92m doubtful.  Much more arrogance needs to be cracked before
Israelis start seeing reality rather than delusions.
=20
Hezbollah lost because =96 well, what was their goal to begin with? To gain
freedom for their prisoners?  To liberate the Sheeba Farms?  To distract
from Iran=92s nuclear intentions?  I=92m not sure, although putting up such a
ferocious defense accounts for a major victory, of sorts.  They fought
Israel to a standstill, the first Arab army to do so.  But precipitating th=
e
destruction of Lebanon was the price, religious fanaticism that leads to
rubble.  If they were smart, they would declare victory, disband as a
militia, join up with the Lebanese military with all of their arms, and
dominate Lebanese politics.  We=92ll see about that . . .
=20
No question, Lebanese civilians of all faiths lost this war.  The beautiful
country, rebuilt after civil war and Israel=92s last debacle, has been wrecke=
d
again.  Displacement, fear, horror, death for the ordinary people.  Likewis=
e
the people of northern Israel, although, again, at only about one tenth the
scale of the Lebanese.  The young soldiers of both sides killed . . . but
that=92s to be expected of war: sorrow and bitter loss.
=20
War is always vicious and stupid, but some wars are more stupid than others=
.
Many people compared this war to World War One, especially for the way it
started over a minor incident and its absurd futility.  Exactly why do thes=
e
armies and militias need to kill civilians?  Why did Israel need to destroy
Lebanon to get at Hezbollah?  Why lob exploding stones at Haifa?
=20
Finally, the Bush bozos are big losers.  They backed Israel=92s assault all
the way, cheering on, declaring that it was necessary to destroy Lebanon in
order to save it =96 until they realized they had lost.  As practice for the
U.S. invading Iran, this war taught a lot, mainly, DON=92T DO IT!  That is, i=
f
Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld can learn any =93reality-based=94 lessons.  As soon a=
s
Bush and his crowd realized Israel wasn=92t going to cut through Lebanon like
cheese, they decided that diplomacy was a good idea, after all.
=20
The American people also lost.  We had the opportunity to watch mayhem paid
for by our tax money non-stop on 24-hour newschannels =96 if we wanted.
Mostly, the American public was relieved it wasn=92t our troops caught in
close combat.  Of course, Iraq is exploding into chaos, and all of America=92=
s
Middle East adventures seem shakier than ever.  With Bush in power, that
could be dangerous, since his solution usually ends up meaning more war.
=20
The fact that the great airplane-bomb-red-alert took over just as the
ceasefire was being negotiated was a bad sign.  It=92s always been useful to
inject a sizeable dose of FEAR into Americans, just to bolster Bush=92s
imperial power.  If indeed this mass-murder plot is real =96 and I=92m always
suspicious =96 and the suddenness of the arrests is not engineered for
political effect, the war has given Muslims, Arabs, and pretty much the
entire world more reasons for hating Americans (or at least our foreign
policy).  Our bombs dropped by =93our=94 Israelis.  When someone asks, why do
they hate us, just point to Lebanon.
=20
So ends the first phase of the American Israeli War Against Lebanon.
Everyone loses!  Hurrah!

Hi All,

The small press scheduled for our levy lives series on Thurs. Sept. 14, 200=
6
unfortunately had to cancel. If your press is game to take this slot--read
our invite letter below for more information--please email me asap.

thanks,
David

Hi,

David Kirschenbaum here. I'm the editor and publisher of Boog City, a New
York City-based small press and community newspaper now in its 16th year.
I'd like to invite you to take part in year four of our "d.a. levy lives:
celebrating the renegade press" series.

The series is held at Chelsea's ACA Galleries (http://acagalleries.com/),
which is owned by the son-in-law and daughter of the poet Simon Perchik.
It's a nice space, and we fit 100 people, including a 9-piece jazz flash
orchestra, in it for Chax Press's event, with plenty of room to spare. The
gallery provides wine and other beverages, and cheese and crackers and
hummus and chips.

Once a month I have a different non-NYC press host and feature three or mor=
e
of their authors to read (we've had as many as 10 for one press and usually
have 3-6) for 60 minutes total. We also have a musical act perform two 15-2=
0
minute sets. If the visiting press is able to book a musical act that's
preferred, so it's truly their night, if not I can book one that I think
will work well with the night.

We started the series in August 2004. In our first three seasons we've
hosted:

(locations are at the time of the event)

--Meritage Press (San Francisco/St. Helena, Calif.)
--The Owl Press (Woodacre, Calif.)
--Tougher Disguises (Oakland, Calif.)
--Cy Press (Cincinnati)

--Firewheel Editions/Sentence, a magazine (Danbury, Conn.)
--Habenicht Press (San Francisco)
--The Canary (Kemah, Texas)
--Duration Press (San Rafael, Calif.)
--a+bend press (Davis, Calif.).
--Ducky (Philadelphia)
--Katalanch=E9 Press (Cambridge, Mass.)

While I agree, and it's one of the reasons i stopped reading at and even hanging around at poetry slams, at the same time, part of the problem with it being difficult to get paid for poetry (i know people who can make a living giving readings, or at least claim to, but they are never very forthcoming when i ask them how it is that they got to that point) is that there aren't very many people willing to pay for poetry. having reconciled myself that i'll never make a living from writing, i have come to recognize that it's actually good for my writing that i have to work a day job.

when i first started submitting poetry dean kostos was kind enough to tell
me about poets marketwhich i bought after ron price was kind enough to tell
me about american voice which i got into and which then paid $loo /poem. i
was incensed to learn that very few journals pay and vowed i would stay in
the black with my poetry submissions which id did the first year. but i am
reminded of brigid murnaghan"s poem in which she sayd did you hear the one
about the polish poet . hes in it for the money. NO disrespect to poles
although i guess if i were polish id think otherwise and than i realized
iLOVED being published and now don"t worry about the$ but i dohave friends
who do not have the other income id o for whom $ continues to be a problem.
solutions? susan maurer

Tell your friends to get jobs. Even novelists and critics have to hold down day jobs these days. Welcome to the arts, there are a lucky few who get to make a living doing it, and most of them suck. The rest of us aren't as lucky, and still most of us suck.

I think another qualification for this should be that the poet who actually
cares about the poetry community.

I bet this is another $25,000 a year job to live in New York.....

While I agree, and it's one of the reasons i stopped reading at and even
hanging around at poetry slams, at the same time, part of the problem with
it being difficult to get paid for poetry (i know people who can make a
living giving readings, or at least claim to, but they are never very
forthcoming when i ask them how it is that they got to that point) is that
there aren't very many people willing to pay for poetry. having reconciled
myself that i'll never make a living from writing, i have come to recognize
that it's actually good for my writing that i have to work a day job.

We are all Hezbollah nowâ€™
New Mideast unity backs Lebanonâ€™s fighters
By Joyce Chediac
Published Aug 14, 2006 9:32 PM

The U.S.-Israeli slaughter of Lebanese people and destruction of the
Lebanese infrastructure has badly backfired for imperialism and all its
agents in the Middle East. A new spirit of struggle is rising in the
region, targeting all the oppressors in that area.
Hezbollah recruits in Beirut.

Hezbollah recruits in Beirut.

After decades of U.S., French and Israeli attempts to divide them, today
the population of Lebanon stands united in a way not seen since the
1970s. From Christians to Sunnis to Shias, from urbane Beirutis to rural
farmers, â€œWe are all Hezbollah now!â€ is the mood of the day.

â€œWe are all Hezbollahâ€ is also heard in the streets from Yemen to Saudi
Arabia to Egypt. Support for the Lebanese and Palestinian resistance has
turned to anger against Arab regimes that have stood by and let this happen.

The â€œwheels of change may already be churning in the Middle East as the
rift between official government policies and popular sentiment on the
â€˜Arab streetâ€™ becomes increasingly evident,â€ reported the Arab news
service Al-Jazeera on Aug. 3. (english.aljazeera.net)

BBC correspondent Hugh Sykes wrote on Aug. 5 from Beirut that when
Israel started bombing that city, people kept saying to him, â€œWe are not
Hezbollahâ€”why are they bombing our homes?â€ But that has changed. Now
people tell Sykes: â€œWe were never Hezbollah. But we are all Hezbollah
now. The Israeli response is completely unjustified.â€

Sykes continued: â€œI donâ€™t think â€˜But we are all Hezbollah nowâ€™ is just
talk. ... There is a sense that now is the time for unity in the face of
Israel.â€

Southern refugees embraced

According to Al-Jazeera of July 31, â€œThousands of Lebanese have reached
across the sectarian and religious divide to help hundreds of thousands
of mostly Shia refugees fleeing Israelâ€™s bombardment in the south.â€

In one East Beirut district, refugees found sanctuary in a school in an
area dominated for decades by the Christian Lebanese Forces, an
ultra-right wing group. â€œLocals from the area have accepted the presence
of the newcomers and some have even embraced them,â€ continued Al-Jazeera.

â€œWe feel their reaction has been very positive. They have brought us
things like milk for the children. I feel like I am home,â€ said Ali
Hassan, who fled the Haret Hreik area in the southern suburb of Beirut.

â€œWe have been expecting something different because of the political
differences in Lebanon. But here I found that we are all Lebanese and I
found a spirit of humanity. If you leave the politicians out of this,
then we are all unified,â€ said Moham mad Kafani, a refugee at the school.

In West Beirut, Fatima Hachem, who works with the refugee help group
Samidoun, said: â€œEveryone was expecting to have some problems between
Sunni and Shia. But a lot of Sunni people have been cooking food and
taking it to the refugees. We didnâ€™t expect this to happen.â€

Faced with widespread shortages of food, oil products and other
necessities, many Lebanese are taking pride in helping each other.

Even the impoverished Rashidyeh Palestinian refugee camp near the city
of Tyre fed and sheltered 82 families who had fled villages near the
Israeli border. Ghada Ajawi, a Palestinian refugee from Rashidyeh, said,
â€œYou feel with them more than anybody because we understand what they
have been through.â€â€™

In further signs of unity, key Sunni religious figures have issued
edicts, binding to the faithful, backing the mostly Shia-based Lebanese
resistance. Qatar-based Sheik Youssef el-Qaradaqwi, one of Sunni Islamâ€™s
most prominent religious scholars, called support for Lebanonâ€™s fighters
the â€œreligious duty of every Moslem.â€

Defying his own governmentâ€™s position, Egyptian Gran Mufti Ali Gommaâ€™s
edict defended Hezbollah, calling its strikes on Israel â€œdefense of its
country and not terrorism.â€

Anger turns against U.S.-client regimes

For decades, Israel has attacked neighboring countries at will. Now,
from Tehran to Cairo, the oppressed watch, electrified and proud, as a
small Lebanese peopleâ€™s militia inflicts more punishment on Israel in a
month than hundreds of thousands of regular Arab troops have in over 50
years. In Cairo, protesters praised the Lebanese resistance leader with
shouts of, â€œTell Nasrallah we are all Hezbollah.â€

Regimes like those in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which originally condemned
Hezbollah and were praised for it by the U.S. and Israel, are now
isolated from their people. Mustapha Bakri, a member of Egyptâ€™s Peopleâ€™s
Assembly, told Al-Jazeera, â€œThe Arab regimes have been exposed to their
populations as the epitome of subservience and followers to their
American masters.â€ He added that â€œrelations between Arab leaders and
their peoples now stand at the edge of total estrangement.â€

â€œHezbollahâ€™s potency and their ability to bombard Israelâ€™s cities and
their capacity to withstand Israelâ€™s onslaught for the first time in
Arab-Israeli conflicts, led the Arab people rallying to their cause
while divorcing their governments,â€ political writer Mahmud Kalil told
the Arab news service.

Take Egypt, for instance, a nation of 70 million people, the lynchpin of
U.S. policy in the area and the first regime to sign a separate peace
with Israel. What did the Egyptians get out of it? Today 23 percent live
below the poverty line, almost half cannot read and write, and infant
mortality is 60.46 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to 6.3 in the U.S.

In the past, demonstrations against Israel aggression, when permitted at
all, have served as a safety valve for the Egyp tian government, taking
attention away from conditions at home.

Today, however, demonstrations in Cairo supporting the Lebanese and
Palestinians are not just chanting â€œLong live your struggle, Lebanon,â€
but also, â€œDown, down with Mubarak!â€ referring to the Egyptian
president. (New York Times, Aug. 6)

â€œThe regular man on the street is beginning to connect everything
together,â€ said Kamal Khalil, director of the Center for Socialist
Studies in Cairo. â€œThe regime impairing his livelihood is the same
regime that is oppressing his freedom and the same regime that is
colluding with Zionism and American hegemony.â€

According to Gasser Abdel Razek, a board member of the Egyptian Organi
zation for Human Rights, â€œEverything making people angry is coming out.â€

The New York Times report on the situation in Egypt concludes: â€œPeople
look at Lebanon and complain about gas prices. They look at Lebanon and
complain about government corruption. They even used Lebanon to attack
the governmentâ€™s efforts to control the political message delivered by
imams across the country.â€

I would recommend the four figure readings which pay much better than the two figure readings and are, although there are some exceptions (mostly corporate or music related), usually found through Universities. Likewise, I understand there are five figure readings but since I have not had one of these yet, I cannot offer further recommendations or commentary.

Steve, come on out to Ohio, if you don't make arrangements beforehand I am certain I could bilk you out of much more than some minor league metropolitanus.

  I would at least guarantee memorable biography worthy shenanigans.




Be well

well thanks  for all your responses  tho i'm not so sure i should have
brought this up to begin with  it's always a sore/soft spot for poets it
seems  got some excellent responses tho that i both agree and disagree
with - as always tho most think it's ok not to receive payment no matter
what the circumstances and possibly my original post meant to provoke did
actually insult a couple of folks and after all it is all a matter of
individual choice
how is it i thought baltimore was in ohio?

craig said some useful stuff and i've read where there was a fixed fee
regardless of audience that i think is alway nice amy said 2 good things
about always being grateful to read and if someone surprises you with
some $ wow a bonus

this one is a great  one here;
"A bookstore or bar is NOT doing you a favor to let you be an attraction
> for them to bring in paying customers--that should be a reciprocally
> beneficial deal for which you are paid.  We need to teach the world to
> stop thinking of poetry as a pro bono art form.'

 tho they are doing you a favor as are you doing them one as well

once a a festival i co -ran the guy who got us the space a true lefty
wanted to take all the bread off the top for the space
and then at some point in the fest pay the performers
i explained to him if you threw a fest and announced FESTIVAL but nothing
else
who would show up the perforemers are like the collective farmers
paty them a token if there is some money taken in

this is what i was getting at thank you for this

"It seems like a detail that has been overlooked is that the woman who
curated got 70% of the door, which means that the venue already took
their
cut and their expenses were covered. So the question is why wouldn't she
share a little of the loot? Did she actually spend $100 on advertising
the
event or on some other hidden expense?" what did she spend that 140 bucks
on?

the event i'm curating sunday the 20th is free - i hope we get a pass the
hat thing happening  and at least 20 or more audience  my expense so far
$10 no that's a lie   6
_________

Amy writes:

I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that Bowery
sometimes collects a certain fee for slots taken, regardless of how many
people attend.  The curator pays the sum and hopes to get it back by
investing even more time and money into advertising.

thanks amy for your input
the bowery takes a percent of what the total door brings in this varies
from 25 to 50 % depending on the event
the rest goes to the artists or the case that spurred this since
discussion since no one spoke of my second scenario or where that 50
bucks i got as did 6 other poets come from(grant money and unexpected )
to the curator who says she incured expenses i assume reaching that sum
of 140 or possibly more
again i am not faulting anyone and also love to read when asked and will
abide by wht is agreed on by all...

if it is a free book party they - the bpc - take a percent of book sales
if it is like the event i am participating in on sunday aug 20 at 6 pm
hint hint
which is donation  bob and i decided on, well more bob did, and it's a
good idea too,
a one drink minimum    this goes to the club
and that is true generosity

Seems to me if you go into a reading knowing you haven't been told you're
getting paid, then you've agreed to read for free. TRUE there in lies my
error
That said, I did a reading Steve curated once and was pleasantly
surprised when he passed a hat and split the collection among the
readers.  This was totally unexpected anda perk, and I was grateful.  I
was also grateful to read when I didn't think
I would make some moolah. ME TOO

Some folks are quite selective in their readings because they want to
make
money and/or want to cultivate being a 'name brand' poet.  A few of those
folks will eventually make the 'big bucks' when it comes to reading --
but
even fewer will make a living at it.  Me, I'm grateful when invited and
money really only becomes a consideration if the person doing the
inviting
brings it up or if the location requires travel. SOME FOLKS ARE TOO
SELECTIVE  AND FOR what is supposed to be A POETRY
COMMUNITY there are way too many factions    i guess we all need to find
out where we belong - hey amy i'd love to read for you some time ...

s.m. said/;
when i first started submitting poetry dean kostos was kind enough to
tell
me about poets marketwhich i bought after ron price was kind enough to
tell
me about american voice which i got into and which then paid $loo /poem.
WOW terrific but i sure wish you'd forgive me and speak to me since this
is a very small tho factionalized communtiy and we're both pretty good
poets

was incensed to learn that very few journals pay and vowed i would stay
in
the black with my poetry submissions which id did the first year. but i
am
reminded of brigid murnaghan"s poem in which she sayd did you hear the
one
about the polish poet . hes in it for the money. NO disrespect to poles
although i guess if i were polish id think otherwise and than i realized
iLOVED being published and now don"t worry about the$ but i dohave
friends
who do not have the other income id o for whom $ continues to be a
problem.
solutions? susan maurer

oh i thought you were calling me a pole susan now i get it  cause i'm
russian i've been told- $ are nice but again that was not really the
issue tho we do all like to be a bit rewarded for our work
and if someone likes you enough to take you home meaning they buy a book
or cd that's even better...
_________________________________________________________________

and
thank you david k it's true  i sometimes do not ask curators in advance
a mistake on my part
but i usually know the club and know that if there's a door charge how it
works
and sadly assume it works the way i would do it if i were curating
in that venue regardless of whether i let the readers know in advance or
they asked me in advance

this payment discussion was meant to prompt just that discussion and to
take us away from war etc
and yap about a bit of down home practicality
it is not meant to insult or offend the person in this case
l. s. who curated one the events i mentioned
where no pay was given
i do many readings for free  and those who know me know that at this
point in my life
i read quite a bit  anyone who knows me knows how fair i am about this
i've been paid nothing many times and for what i think a poet is used to
getting who is not in the academic or festival circuits  good sums at
times
i have done many benefits
and have participated in as well as curated many events
not saying this out of ego or to illicit sympathy
i agree wholeheartedly with all that david k. says
and it does vary from situation to situation
when i have done events like one i am doing sunday where there is no
charge
i inform the readers or musicians of the circumstances
if i get no money from door they get no money
if this does not suit them that's fine
and they don't have to do the gig   ditto for me in reverse situations
but david k. again is right iin the scenarios mentioned that instituted
this discussion
i did not ask in advance
therefore that is my problem  aside:
shit i always have trouble asking

when i read at david's small press event for wandering hermit
i knew this event was free asked for nothing
& expected nothing
there have been times where i was paid well for free events
without asking but yes it's alway good to ask
especially if it is not a free event   anyway
the reason i brought this up is precisely because
i strongly believe that what the curator lays out for an event is their (
my if i am the curator ) problem tho some should be recouped after giving
at least a token to the readers
but that if there is a charge at the door and part goes to the house and
part to the
curator/participants  unless it is a benefit some token should be given
to the readers
shit i'm repeating myself aren't i
i had a good time too at this event
this is not the issue sorry i didn't make it a general question at
another time
i didn't get upset that i wasn't given part of the door i was making an
inquiry
not just about me but about all the readers
if the concensus was that no one else cared  or bothered to ask
then i'll always abide by that
no matter what my opinion might be
it's not about special treatment here tho we all are a bit special
and there fore all should share

and when did ya (l.s.) read for me for gratis?
if i charged at the door
everyone got something no matter how small  unless audience was a no show

or the house took 100%  and it would be unlikely in the second case that
i would throw an event in such a venue
this is not meant to provoke argument
but stimulate conversation about poets who like everyone else should
perhaps
get paid for their work when there is even a bit of $ to consider
again unless there is no entrance fee or it is a benefit

i feel it's a worthy discussion
most poets act like martyrs and think reading for $  is taboo
where as bowling for $ is not

i understand cost factors  on aug 20
since there is no door charge and no reader has asked for money
of course no one including myself will get paid
and i will not recoup the money i spent  what i spent unless we pass the
hat
and i take out what's mine first
but even in this scenario if little is taken in at door or by donation
i will split it with the readers before i take my expenses out

wow what a rambling disjointed rant

any way sorry l.s. if you felt offended  this was not my intent
i'd love to read with you and hal and reggie etc in sept
for free if that is the case

tom savage who is a dear friend is both right and wrong
the issue especially here in the apple is not about getting paid as tom
and i know having read together many times and we will again in about a
week
at free events or donation events

it's gain about the ones where folks charge at the door
i'm focusing on and yes tom i know many poets who will not read anymore
for nothing
one in point won't read for under $1000

and what about out of town or out of country readings?

air fare at least  cab fare  train  fare bus  fare??  nothing  ???

just the priveledge of reading as someone once told me when i refused to
go all the way to boston when there was no china town bus, to read for
1/2 hour  for the GLORY?
i was once offered a great gig in new orleans summer 120 degrees
same festival with creeley baraka and other greats i was honored to be
asked
i am not brgrudging them their statis  and the fact that their way was
paid and their
accomodations  but i and a handful of others  some who went
had to pay large plane fares and 50$ a night for a room
i regret not having gone but in the long run the gig would not have
helped me in anyway except for the joy of sharing all that poetry and
music
which i'm sure was fantastic
but  if i had gone & taken my wife which i generally do
a great poet in her own right it would have cost 2 grand almost and
without her
at least well you get the point...
sure it would have no doubt been an unforgettable event
but.....................

oh i was one of those readers vernon treated to dinner a real mensch
but it is a drag to go so far to lose money  unless you feel it is a
truly
positive and worth while experience
which i guess for me isn't my #1 consideration

i will be doing a gig in lowell in oct  pay my own bus fare get put up
most likely make a bit of $ back bus fare so cheap now
and share the door it will be cheap enough to make it worth while
and in nov getting my way paid to baltimore
all cases are different  i opt for far away they pay
in town wait around (depending on the circumstance )
 it all depends  on logistics  cost factors  distance  perks  other than
just ego etc

as ted joans used to say  no bread no ted  for me that only applies long
distance

thanks  david  baptise  true enough about yer monetary deductions
tho it happens rarely  and etc
but this has nothing to do with those who work in the club(s)
or those on ssi i'm going thru the disabled stuff myself
anyone who has lived in the music world sees this argument a bit clearer
and
as for the clubs / what they (%) take helps pay help and overhead
again the club's choice and decision also club and workers survive drinks
,tips and meager salaries  i have many friends who work in & own them
this no easy life
i loved yer input even if i don't totally agree  i'm making one simple
point
and i am (en)lightened up  sorry if ya thought i was uptight over this
but
door  money  that does not go to club but to artists
should be split by all involved


i like this as an add  true true

I do agree with the idea that it's good for your writing to have to work, if
only because it's important to have contact with "normal" people--people who
aren't artists and also slog their way through day jobs they hate to fund
whatever their passions may be.

I often worry that such an attitude is just a rationalization for the fact
that I can't get paid for what I do or that I don't have the "hustle" to be
able to do so.  And as I get older, it's just harder mentally to do work I
don't care about, and my energy level is winding down to be able to do one
thing 40 hours a week and the thing I care about another 20, 40 or 50 hours
a week.

While I agree, and it's one of the reasons i stopped reading at and even
hanging around at poetry slams, at the same time, part of the problem with
it being difficult to get paid for poetry (i know people who can make a
living giving readings, or at least claim to, but they are never very
forthcoming when i ask them how it is that they got to that point) is that
there aren't very many people willing to pay for poetry. having reconciled
myself that i'll never make a living from writing, i have come to recognize
that it's actually good for my writing that i have to work a day job.

One of the things, seems to me, that killed off fees for a reading
was the proliferation of mega bookstore readings  (less important in
cities, but quite vital in suburban and small towns). When B&N and
Borders first came to North Jersey  --readers would get gift
certificates, t-shirts, a day of reading employee discount and carte
blanche at the coffe bar. once, at a Borders, a manager gave me
thirty bucks out of petty cash! That stopped quickly and now you are
lucky if you get a coffe + you can't pass the hat. This lack of non-
payment seems to spread, as it used to be a point of honor for an
organizer to give the reader something. (And, once upon a time, many
small press magazines tries to pay 'something" for poems)

Do we hurt ourselves as a community by our willingness to perform too
often for free--or too often, at a loss? Even at venues that pay, say
colleges, the $100 dollar max fee for a local well-known poet seems
set in stone from some point in late 60s (when, according Lewis
warsh) you could pay your rent and still have something left over.

There is a poetry series at Stevens Tech in Hoboken that doesn't even
buy the reader a coffee. I asked the organizer about maybe paying
poets and he responded he had dozens of people, many w/ some rep,
willing to read without a fee.

Or  maybe attitudes have changed as so many of us are working full
time (or, too often, all the time) and are less dependent on giving
readings to make ends meet.

Hezbollah 2, Israel 0
Joanna Francis
http://crescentandcross.com/index.php?page=articles&author=joanna_francis&subpage1=hezbollah2

Make no mistake about it â€“ the Israelis are getting their tails kicked
in Lebanon! Just like they did in May 2000, when Hezbollah sent them
scurrying back across the border with their tails between their legs.
The Israelis never forgot that stinging defeat and have now demanded a
rematch with Hezbollah. And much to their surprise, Israel has already
managed to lose the rematch too. Considering the disparity in numbers
and weaponry between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel should have achieved
a decisive victory by now. But they haven't. And it doesn't help their
case any that they have had to resort to bombing the entire country,
killing women and children, to try to save face. It only makes them
look more pathetic. They will never be able to swagger quite so
arrogantly again, or instill fear in the groveling leaders of their
neighboring countries in quite the same way. The Israelis have been
outfoxed at every turn by an irregular army using prehistoric
weaponry, with little to no support from neighboring countries (the
leaders, that is), but who have proven themselves to be unwavering in
their determination. Hezbollah are fighting against the best weaponry
American money can buy. And they are winning.

Because you can't buy courage. Even with the entire United States
treasury at your disposal, the things that matter most to real men
simply cannot be purchased. Therefore, the poor man has the advantage
over the rich man because valor, manliness, and honor are free to
those with nothing to lose. The Israelis had everything to lose in
this misguided operation and have proceeded to do so exceedingly well.
Even among their most brainwashed sycophants, their credibility is in
the single digits. The excuse of the "kidnapped" soldiers is totally
bogus to anyone with an I.Q. over 70, because Hezbollah has offered to
release them in exchange for a ceasefire but Israel has refused.
Meanwhile, Israel has kidnapped thousands of Lebanese citizens over
the years who languish in Israeli prisons to this day. And the
Katyusha rocket pity party won't work either, because the Katyusha
rockets are simply in retaliation for Israeli aggression, not vice
versa, and can hardly compare to the bombs being dropped on Lebanon.

If they thought for one moment that they would rout out Hezbollah,
they were seriously mistaken. You cannot eliminate a fighting force
whose reason for existence is justified by the fact that Israel
continues to occupy their land, invade their air space, and hold their
people as political prisoners. Kill them all, and another generation
will simply step up to the plate and take their place.

The Israelis fight like sissies from fighter jets, dropping
bunker-buster bombs on defenseless women and children. That's real
manly! They roll across the border in heavily-armored tanks, confident
that they'll be impervious to Hezbollah's weaker arsenal. Only lately,
those tanks have had the surprising habit of turning into human
crematoria for the Israeli soldiers inside them. So why don't they get
out of their tanks and fighter jets and go toe-to-toe with Hezbollah
like real men? (See first sentence of essay). The fourth most powerful
military in the world has been given a shiny black eye that no amount
of make-up will ever be able to hide. The aura of invincibility they
so haughtily projected is now tarnished beyond repair. Bragging rights
go to Hezbollah, as Israel eats its long-overdue humble pie. Why do I
feel so strongly about this, you might ask? Because Israel has made
me, an American taxpayer, complicit in their war crimes, and I, for
one, am glad to see them finally getting their comeuppance.

In fact, the Israelis are losing so badly that their co-religionists
in the West have had to order new false flag operations to take their
humiliating defeat off the front pages. It's like that scene in the
Wizard of Oz where Toto pulls back the curtain on the "Great Oz," only
to discover that he's really a weaselly old man, pretending to be
something that he's not. Well, the curtain has been pulled back on the
Zionists, and they are standing there in all their naked cowardice and
cruelty, for all world to see. And the world is repulsed. Hence, the
PR campaign now underway to try to remind us goyim that all Muslims
are "terrorists" and that the Israelis are always the victims. So now
we're supposed to feel relieved that the Israelis are only killing
"terrorists" (not human beings), and that they are only trying to make
the world a safer place for all of us. Only it's not going to work
this time. I mean, how stupid do they think we are? Just when world
sympathy was leaning heavily towards Lebanon and away from Israel,
does any sane person really believe that Muslims would try to pull off
an ill-fated stunt? Only the most credulous of FOX News watchers could
fail to notice that the timing of these supposed terror plots is
extraordinarily convenient.

The mainstream media is just another weapon in the Israeli armory, but
this time, chinks are beginning to show. The Zionist-controlled media
try their best to obfuscate the cowardice of their own kin by wrongly
portraying Hezbollah as hiding behind women and children. In
psychiatry (a dangerous medical specialty they invented), this is
called "projection," or the attempt to transfer your own negative
traits onto another person. They know all about projection because
they do it so well. But Israel cannot hide the fact that they have
slaughtered more than 1,000 civilians, mostly women and children, and
have destroyed almost the entire infrastructure of a modern,
democratic state. Yet they cynically try to portray themselves as
reluctant and contrite killers, in a grotesque attempt to blame
innocent victims for their own deaths.

What did they think was going to happen when they plunked themselves
down in the middle of a million Arabs, after slaughtering them to
steal their land in 1948? Did they really think they would get away
with it indefinitely? Obviously so, since they've now set out to
conquer more sovereign Arab territory, fully revealing their
expansionist agenda to anyone with eyes to see. Only something
unexpected has happened on the way to Eretz Israel; they've run into a
brick wall called Hezbollah, who will not relinquish their sovereignty
to the Zionist land-grabbers.

It's slowly starting to dawn on the Zionists that Lebanon will never
be part of Eretz Israel, and that the Litani River will never provide
drinking water to Israeli settler households. Plan "Eretz Israel" has
been put on hold by a small Lebanese militia with more guts than most
men can even dream about. In any area that counts, Hezbollah is
already victorious. Courage? How brave do you have to be to stay and
fight when you are out-numbered, out-gunned, out-tanked, and
out-bombed? Very brave, indeed. This war was nothing more than an
Israeli land-grab attempt, and an opportunity to exercise collective
punishment on an entire people for Israel's defeat at the hands of
Hezbollah in May 2000. But the Israeli soldiers aren't half the
fighters Hezbollah are; hence, their second defeat in six years at the
hands of their bitter enemies. Hezbollah now owns them â€“ lock, stock
and barrel.

 PRAISE FOR PP/FF AN ANTHOLOGY:

"In our age of test marketing and referential storylines, it's sometimes ha=
rd to remember that writing is a creative act that can produce material as =
original and multifaceted as any other art form. PP/FF, an anthology edited=
 by Peter Conners, serves up an exciting collection of unusual writing, not=
 to be classified by structure or content, except that most pieces are shor=
t (one or two pages) and achieve the immediacy of storytelling....  Nearly =
every selection in this anthology seeks to respond to a timely question, re=
veal a painful truth, or depict a collective memory."

- Rain Taxi Review of Books, Summer 2006

"Once again feisty little Starcherone Books runs in and scoops the field, e=
nsuring PP/FF a long life in bookstores, in classroom use and for course ad=
option at programs sympathetic to the daring and experimental. Peter Conner=
s, one of the most noted US prose poets, here takes on a gigantic challenge=
, as he struggles to produce a solid critical mass of what he considers the=
 exciting "flash fictions" and "prose poems" of today. Wearing the heroic f=
lippers of the editor, Conners has waded through the dregs of this material=
 and pulled out a whole variety of plums of different sorts."

- Kevin Killian review for Amazon.com=20

"...PP/FF is a kind of earthly paradise where the Language poet lies down w=
ith the self-absorbed memoirist, the bourgeois Fabulist picks fleas off the=
 back of the avant-garde Maoist and everyone wears lovely party clothes - o=
r a nice new boiler suit."

Joe Darby, the "whistle blower" at Abu Ghraib, speaks out. He acted bravely
in sending those photos to the Army Criminal Investigation Division. He was
still at Abu Ghraib when Donald Rumsfeld announced his name on television.
Surely Rumsfeld must have known that he was still at Abu Ghraib.

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6232757351172260101&q=war
And here is Jessie MacBeth, another veteran of the Iraq war. Jessie
estimates he killed 200 people when he was there, many of them women and
children, many of them with a bullet to the head at close range. Jessie is
ashamed of himself and ashamed of his country and is speaking out against
what the USA is doing in Iraq.

Jessie MacBeth is probably in more danger for speaking out about what he did
than he is for what he did in Iraq. He was following orders (though that
didn't help Eichmann). And, to judge from the fact that Joe Darby is in
protective custody to this day, Joe Darby is in more danger for what he did
than MacBeth is for what he did.

Yet for all the unspeakable evil that Jessie MacBeth perpetrated in
following orders in Iraq and Charles Graner did at Abu Ghraib, it is as
nothing compared with what Bush and Rumsfeld and others did in leading the
USA to war against Iraq on the basis of false intelligence. And a litany of
subsequent perversions/subversions of justice that led to situations where
Jessie MacBeth could simply be following orders and Charles Graner could
feel he was doing his job acceptably.

But the USA has a hero in Joe Darby. A real one. Because he had the guts to
do the right thing.

I see it is 111 degrees fahrenheit in Baghdad today.

Your right.  What you are talking about probably is a rationalization.  We need to find more equitable ways of getting poets paid not only for reading their works or "performing" them but actually for having them printed and even, dare I say?, for writing them.  Brigid Murnaghan had a wonderful poem about this problem I published in an old Tamarind many moons ago.  If it's still out there floating around somewhere, I invite anyone to put it on the web, even in this discussion, if that is agreeable to all parties. I suspect Ms. Murnaghan wouldn't mind a new audience for her old ideas.

I often worry that such an attitude is just a rationalization for the fact
that I can't get paid for what I do or that I don't have the "hustle" to be
able to do so. And as I get older, it's just harder mentally to do work I
don't care about, and my energy level is winding down to be able to do one
thing 40 hours a week and the thing I care about another 20, 40 or 50 hours
a week.

While I agree, and it's one of the reasons i stopped reading at and even
hanging around at poetry slams, at the same time, part of the problem with
it being difficult to get paid for poetry (i know people who can make a
living giving readings, or at least claim to, but they are never very
forthcoming when i ask them how it is that they got to that point) is that
there aren't very many people willing to pay for poetry. having reconciled
myself that i'll never make a living from writing, i have come to recognize
that it's actually good for my writing that i have to work a day job.

LA ART GIRLS BIO:=20

=20

The LA Art Girls evolved from informal gatherings,

which started in 2004, as a means of encouraging

discourse on contemporary art and as a way to

introduce artists to other artists. The intentions of

the LA Art Girls are to provide inspiration, support,

dialogue and feedback to one another. As a body, LA

Art Girls recognizes the autonomy of its members and

resists the articulation of a coherent group identity

or central theme. The group strives to be a voluntary

and non-hierarchical gathering of practices. While the

LA Art Girls started as a discussion group, it has

evolved to embody a variety of different roles. The LA

Art Girls have made collective artworks, we have shown individual work =
in
group shows, we have curated shows, hosted panel discussions, and soon, =
a
radio show. The LA Art Girls have done projects with QED gallery, Anna
Helwing Gallery, The Getty Center, and LACE. Upcoming projects include a
Radio Show for KBCH in Long Beach, and a group exhibition in the project
room at Angles. While there are over 30 members of the LA Art Girls at =
this
time, a lesser number participates in the collaborative projects on a
self-selecting basis.=20

On the subject, To Topos is taking submissions for its issue on Poetry and Poverty to which I know many of us can speak.  The issue will feature an introduction by Michael Parenti and will be guest edited by Karen Holmberg.

  Please consider supporting our fine journal.

  for details:

  http://oregonstate.edu/dept/foreign_lang/totopos/index.html

  Moreover, this discussion reminds me of a poem by Han Shan in which someone criticizes his poetics. Han Shan responds with something like, "people like him should stick to making money."

  I have no problems passing the hat after a reading, or giving the audience an opportunity to purchase an inexpensive, short chapbook.  (Most non-poet audiences are reluctant to buy a $15 full-length book, but will easily drop $3 to $5 for a chapbook.  If it's money that I'm after, it's really not that difficult to get it.  If being paid for my craft is what I'm after, I have to be creative about what I consider payment.  And of course, I have to be more selective in which events to participate.

  All this discussion brings up many reasons to remind you to invest in To Topos: Poetry International by purchasing copies or a subscription and by submitting your original work or work in translation.

  The Contemporary Hungarian Poetry issue contains my introduction exploring the motives of American poets compared to Hungarian poets, laying the blame on the consumerist raison d'etre mentality of our society.  If you haven't explored the Hungarian tradition, you're missing out.

  Our forthcoming issue is on Indigenous Americas:  Poetry by Indigenous Peoples of the Western Hemisphere and is guest edited by Allison Hedge Coke.  It should be out this fall.

  Please consider supporting our fine journal.

  I've sent copies to Murat Nemet-Nejat and to Ron Silliman.  Of course, Ron thinks that a thematic production of poetry may as well be about cats, so I don't know how he received our Hungarian issue.  Is that Cats or cats?  I don't know, but see his 6/9/06 entry.  I agree with him, poets should be for poetry first, not money, not social justice, not anything but poetry.  However, we humans like to sort our beans to yield manageable harvests.

I've had an idea about this kicking around my head for a while now.  People
who write music and lyrics register with ASCAP or BMI, both of which collect
money from all venues where music is hear (clubs, restaurants, radio) then
pay out the money to the composers and lyric writers.  There are flaws with
the system, which are easily google-able- Madonna probably gets more of her
share of the money at the expense of small timers.  But, it may be a
workable system if one stays on top of it and reports whenever they get
indie radio play or performs at clubs.  SO why not register poems as lyrics
then try to use that system?  I'm it wouldn't be much but it would be
something.  I've registered but haven't tried this yet with poems.  Writing
about this reminds me to try though... At least it's a practical attempt to
find a solution.

Interested in the cultures of collaboration
and collectivity within group practice?

Check out http://www.groupsandspaces.net

Help to build a database of people working in
creative groups, collectives and movements.

*********************************************

Dear enthusiasts of group work and collaboration:

Temporary Services has worked as a group since late in
1998. We are interested in the cultures of
collaboration and collectivity within group practice.

While much recent attention has been given to these
ways of working, few substantial documents have been
produced that reflect the amount of work that has been
accomplished. There is also a need for more writing on
the inner dynamics of the group process: how
collaborations are formed, how decisions are made, how
conflict is resolved, and so on.

We are compiling the names, locations, and dates (when
available) of art and arts-related groups, which can
include those who work as curatorial collectives. We
would like your help!

The list will be published in a book we are working on
titled Group Work. The book will include interviews,
quotes about working together, lists of words used to
describe the numerous ways in which we group
ourselves, and a list of historic and currently active
groups.

The list will also be a part of a larger initiative
called Groups and Spaces that several people have
contributed to. Groups and Spaces includes groups of
one person (who still chooses to work under a group
name), couples who work as a group, groups of three or
more people, and open networks that are named, but
aren't necessarily a collective or more circumscribed
group.

We would like your help to develop this list and make
it as comprehensive as possible. Please visit
http://www.groupsandspaces.net to see the list of
groups and to submit names of groups not listed,
corrections to information already posted, or any
suggestions you have to make the list better.

The list is still under construction, but is public
and accessible to all. A more sophisticated,
searchable database and sets of research tools are
planned for the site after this preliminary list
making is over.

Thank you,
Temporary Services
(Brett Bloom, Salem Collo-Julin, Marc Fischer)

P.S. --
Please forward this widely so many people
can see it and contribute.

I run a CD label that's released works by a couple of dozen composers of
various flavors of avant garde music & have some experience in dealing
with both BMI & ASCAP.

Given that the "google-able" flaws in this system often involve lack of
payments for composers who sell 2,000-50,000 copies of their recordings,
perform between 50 and 200 nights a year, and get airplay on hundreds of
"alternative rock" stations around the US, and rarely include tales of
composers who sell less than 500 copies of a recording, have works
performed less than a few dozen times in a year and/or get played on a
handful of 1-2 hour specialty programs on a handful of radio stations
across the United States, the use-value of adapting this system for
poets seems questionable to me.

Add to that the difficulty in getting either of these performing rights
organizations to recognize non-musical work that's not published in the
usual ways that music is, and the task seems that much more daunting.

But, hey
.

I want to finally remedy the Pessoa gap in my reading. Anyone have any helpful thoughts on the pros and cons of the different versions/translations, Zenith/Penguin, Costa/Serpent's Tail, Mac Adam's/Exact Change, and any others that out there? I remember someone once saying something about the Zenith version, but can't remember now whether that was a "the best bet" or "as long as you avoid that one..." remark.

Thanks!

*Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 15th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It  hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea's ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB's, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.

*Fence
Fabulously non-wealthy founding editor Rebecca Wolff launched Fence in 1998=
,
with the invaluable aid of her beloved compatriots Caroline Crumpacker,
Jonathan Lethem, Frances Richard, and Matthew Rohrer. Max Winter signed up
soon after and has the distinction of being the only non-original editor
who's lasted more than a few years, so far. Read the history books: It's
been a long steady roll down the hill of institutional derangement. Fence
Books was launched in 2001 and continues to awe the caring populace with th=
e
genius it smacks between covers (French folds, at that). Support Fence!
Current editors include brilliances Lynne Tillman, Christopher Stackhouse,
Katy Lederer, and, last but far from least, Charles Valle, who keeps our
little picket boat afloat.

*Fungo Monographs is the publisher of "Seven Palms" by Kira Henehan, and
belongs to a series of one-shot publications published at random intervals
and inefficiently distributed. Jordan Davis has described Fungo Monographs
and the collective one-shot series as: "perhaps the most perverse concept o=
f
branding yet to emerge from poetryland's anti-business-model incubator..."

*Futurepoem publishes innovative prose, poetry and cross-genre literature b=
y
both emerging and underrepresented writers.  Our rotating editorial panel
shares the responsibility for selecting and helping to publicize the books
that we publish. Before submitting work, we recommend perusing our previous
titles as a good indication of the range of work that we like to publish.
For more information on publications and submission guidelines, visit
futurepoem.com and consider joining our mailing list.

*Hanging Loose is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year. It is one of
the oldest small literary presses in the country. The name was inspired by
the format of the original magazine--mimeographed loose pages in a cover
envelope--and that, in turn, was inspired by a very low budget. Effective
with the 25th issue we abandoned that format to the relief of librarians an=
d
booksellers.
 =20
Early on, the Hanging Loose editors decided we were not interested in
begging poems from famous writers but in stressing work by new writers and
older writers whose work deserved a larger audience.
 =20
The editors are proud of having published many first books, including the
first full collections by Sherman Alexie, Kimiko Hahn, D. Nurkse, Jack
Ag=FCeros, Elinor Nauen, Joanna Fuhrman, Maggie Nelson, Indran Amirthanayagam=
,
and Beth Bosworth, among others. Some of the other writers published by HL
are Wilma Elizabeth McDaniel, Frances Phillips, Harvey Shapiro, Jayne
Cortez, Ron Overton, Helen Adam, Paul Violi, Charles North, Ha Jin, Morton
Marcus, Maureen Owen, Donna Brook, Yukihide Hartman, Jack Anderson and Ed
Friedman.

*Kitchen Press is a micro-press run out of Hell's Kitchen, NYC, and is a
member of CLMP. It's purpose is to publish quality handmade chapbooks by
emerging poets.=20

*Rachel Lipson is a Brooklyn-based songwriter who performs her simple,
honest songs on guitar (and sometimes ukulele and banjo). Born near Detroit=
,
MI, she spent her childhood building forts with her brother and sister in
the living room, contemplating the dangers of the dark and pizza deliverers=
,
riding horses and playing with friends. Rachel first picked up a guitar at
age 16 and a few years later, after having moved to New York, began craftin=
g
the songs that would make up her first album, This Way, which she
self-released the next year. In 2003 Rachel released a 7" with Rough Trade
recording artist Jeffrey Lewis, on Holland's Nowhere Fast record label and
self-released her second album Some More Songs. She toured Europe for seven
weeks with Lewis and Herman D=FCne in the summer, including the Mofo festival
in Paris in July. In the fall, Rachel recorded a new album at Olive Juice
Studios in New York for her latest release Pastures on Meccico Records, a U=
K
label founded and run by members of Cornershop. In the last few years,
Rachel has collaborated and performed extensively with Leah Hayes (of La
Laque and Scary Mansion), Herman D=FCne and others and has played alongside
Eugene Chadbourne, Kimya Dawson, Daniel Johnston, The Mountain Goats and
Refrigerator, as well as twice performing live on WFMU in New Jersey and on
WNYC, a division of NPR. Rachel Lipson's music combines a sort of radical
simplicity and honesty with intricately woven narratives. The lyrics seem t=
o
have as much to do with William Faulkner as they do with Woody Guthrie. The
music recalls the earliest folk traditions and yet speaks at the same time
to a contemporary minimal aesthetic. While sometimes the approach is
blindingly direct and at others masterfully oblique, the overall effect is
irresistible, one of invitingly gentle beauty and clarity.

*Lungfull! Magazine is the waterproof brainchild of editor Brendan Lorber.
Featuring an impeccably glossy cover and usually illustrated by Lorber's
drawings (which quite often include sketches of poets reading publicly), th=
e
magazine is unique in that it juxtaposes the first draft of a work with the
published version, and includes an extensive "working note" by writers. It'=
s
highly compelling to examine where a writer began with an idea, and how s/h=
e
took that idea into a finished poem. And the first drafts present an
enormous range: from scribbled drawings on napkins, to just-about-finished
typed poems that apparently sprang out full-blown, like Athena from the hea=
d
of Zeus. Contributors include Bill Berkson, Eileen Myles, Alice Notley, Wal=
t
Whitman, and Emily Dickinson.

*Open 24 Hours is dedicated to publishing limited edition books by poets
working in traditions rooted in experimentation and social engagement. The
Open 24 Hours design is influenced by the staple-bound mimeo revolution of
the American small press underground most visibly recognized in the books
published by many 2nd- and 3rd-generation New York School Poets. We have
simply adapted the method to digital technology.

Open 24 Hours has published books by Mariana Ruiz Firmat, Corina Copp, Bets=
y
Fagin, Joel Dailey, Chris Toll, and Steve Carey. Forthcoming are books by
Erica Kaufman, Arlo Quint, Will Yakulic, and Dustin Williamson.

Open 24 Hours is based in New York City, edited and designed by John Colett=
i
and Greg Fuchs. Jon Allen is our in-house illustrator. We took the name fro=
m
D.C. poet Buck Downs, who published a poetry zine by the same name. Downs
inherited Open 24 Hours from Baltimore poet Chris Toll, who started it in
1980.

*Portable Press at Yo-Yo Labs endeavors to publish works that possess a
vitality and holistically consider emotional and political realms to say th=
e
least. Works that venture out beyond writing program platforms and communit=
y
expectations. Works that have substantiality in the way of vision.

*Sona Books, run out of Brooklyn, is a community-based chapbook press with =
a
corresponding web magazine, published about two times a year, at
www.sonaweb.net.  Sona Books publishes works that are quiet, risky,
experimental, collaborative, hybrid, and sometimes rough around the edges.
The press seeks ways to reach wide audiences and to teach non-poets about
so-called "difficult" poetries and prose works; to this end, the press runs
a subscription series, publishes bulletins entitled "how to read a Sona
Book," and encourages writers to publish process notes.  It's the goal of
Sona Books to stay small, to reach out to poets whose projects may be "unde=
r
the radar," to facilitate self-publishing exchanges among writers, and to
affirm generative relationships between editor and writer.

I won't get into the Book of Disquiet debates right now, but
personally I think the best place to start with Pessoa is
that 50 (or is it 70) page selection translated by Chris Daniels in a
recent CRAYON magazine----I know it's just an excerpt in a literary
journal, but it's so long and substantial it feels like a Pessoa
book, and a great introduction to a more DYNAMIC, in my opinion,
Pessoa than the B of D....C

Subject:      STOP deportation for Elvira Arellano

I am not a criminal.
I am not a terrorist.
I am a mother and a worker.

-- from a statement by Elvira Arellano,
immigrant rights activist

*************************************

Three blocks from my apartment, Elvira and her son
Saul have taken refuge in a small store-front church.
Elvira is actively disobeying an order by the
Department of Homeland Security to turn herself in for
deportation.  One of my 8th grade poetry students
tells me, "She is our Rosa Parks."  Everyday, we both
visit Elvira at the church.

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE:
Refusal to obey governmental demands or commands
especially as a nonviolent and usually collective
means of forcing concessions from the government

Elvira is a well-known Chicago leader of undocumented
workers.  President of La Familia Latina Unida, she
recently lead a Mother's Day hunger strike demanding
that President Bush call a moratorium on "raids,
deportations and separations of families" until the
Senate and the Congress come to a resolution of this
nation's broken immigration laws.

In past years, I have invited Elvira to be my guest
speaker at Truman College and at community-art events
I organize with Anti Gravity Surprise.  She has openly
shared her story with all who want to listen: the
dangers of crossing the border, the difficulties of
being a single mom, the raids after 9/11, the false
promises from politicians.  But, Elvira Arellano is
the real promise.  The promise of a movement to
organize workers for equality and justice.

Ah, Joel---

Thanks for this. It was many years ago I remember (fondly) you

There was Ginsburg's style - and Creeley's. Two very
different approaches. I mean, and I loved and love
Creeley, but some of his work was, well, behind the
scenes or anonymous - intensely caring, intimate, but
less overtly political. Ginsburg was all hairy ape and
naked human - and sometimes ugly, to some, media hog,
to some, straight to the throat to others. What is the
correct approach, one wonders. Can I get some public
or back channel advice. The time is a different one,
an urgency in the air, can we agree on this one - so
much chaos - and really. Do I act publicly and risk
damaging street cred - or do I gain street cred. Do I
remember that poetry is about the reaffirmation of
those ties that remind of us our connection to
humanity - and the devine? One wants to do what is
right, to create communitie, understanding that our
place, this home, is immediate and only temporary.
Silly question, perhaps.

Where in the American landscape is there openness. Not
supposed openness, but open poetry and, regardless of
whatever bright lights, lights kept on for those
seeking ways out of whatever darkness. Poetry, as we
know, is a vocation. That cusp on which poets are
ready to be Whitman-esque!

I am a poet, damn it.

My wife and I  a couple of friends have been thinking long and hard
about the question of self-publishing.  We decided that one way to
give self-publishing better legs was to start a highly selective
cooperative  press that printed quality books and that required the
poet to pay production costs.  We aren't trying to get rich --
there's no reading fee and poets get all royalties.  (We're shooting
for a run of 1000  (hand sewn, acid-free)  for under $3,000.)  Our
first book, Loyalties, by Henry Braun, has enjoyed high praise from
people like Nathaniel Tarn,  Eleanor Wilnor, and Jerry Rothenberg,
and we have two other manuscripts under serious consideration.

We are looking for poets at least 60 years old who have already
published at least one book.  Our names are Tam Lin Neville, Henry
Braun, and Bert Stern.  More information available at www.offthe
gridpress.net, or contact us   at info@offthegridpress.net.

I remember someone once saying that writing any poem was a political action.  Unfortunately, I don't remember who said this.  Most overtly political poems are time-limited and occasionally they turn out to be wrong also via the passage of time.  Neruda's poems in praise of Stalin are my favorite example of the latter.  As for Mr. Ginsberg, when his poems related to a specific political context, although they were often quite good ( ex. Angkor Wat), as time passes, it may seem that these poems require notes or commentary for readers born since the events commented on transpired.  This is an unfortunate limitation of overtly political poetry.  Another instance is the poetry written about and or during the Spanish Civil War, much of it quite good.  You might have trouble today finding young readers who would know what the Spanish Civil War was all about.  This is not to deride the issues involved or the poems but merely to note the effect of the passage of time.

Yes, if you want immediate political efficacy PLEASE write a letter to congress or an article for a political magazine or organize a demonstration or campaign for a politician you support. I personally have never been convinced of art's efficacy in any immediate political situation, or its usefulness to politics in the narrowest sense, but have always been convinced of how bad "political" ("activist" may be a better term) art nearly invariably is.

I certainly don't think anything escapes the political--fantasmatic, ideological, etc.--in the broadest sense, but working on that level takes a patience that the urgency of most activism cannot afford. For my part, the so-called Language Poets are probably the most effective in this latter area; it's what distinguishes them from the "mainstream," as it is both the source of their thematic and aesthetic difference -- and is the source, of course, of their insistence on undermining/complicating that form/content binary. Before Icame back to poetry and discovered that such a thing as "language poetry" existed, I learned from such poststructuralist theorists as Lacan, Foucault, and Butler that to effect real change, ultimately, you have to work on the structure of language/subjectivity/symbolico-imaginary/"reality". I still very much believe this, if you can predict with any success the actual or even approximate outcome of your efforts, which I think is the real wrench in the
 works....

Thanks, by the way, to all those who responded to my inquiry into Pessoa translations!

oddly, for one of my nascent reading series, we are trying to get PEN and

Yes, I agree on both counts.
BTW, Johnathan Griffin's translations of Pessoa from Carcarnet Press still
hold up pretty well--4 small books, each written in one of P's personae.
Was it Edwin Honig who did a Pessoa book in the 60s or 70s?

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi all,
I've been reading "Children of Albion" the last couple of days, and it has come to my attention as i'm tracking down the names of some of the poets I like in here that my knowledge of current poetry from the UK
is woefully lacking. I'm particularly enjoying Gael Turnbull and Adrian Mitchell who I discovered here. Can anyone recommend any other poets from Great Britain, particular Scots or Welsh poets? or good anthologies that are more recent? I understand that there were some important poets left out of Children of Albion that a lot of people thought should have been in it, at least, so says wikipedia. Any recs for any of those?

thanks for all answers,
Jason

"Eggcorns" is the linguists' name for the blooper language that still
has some sense to it -- the name's taken from a twisted version of
"acorns."  You've probably seen some if you read students' writing....

This woman entered the USA illegally after she was deported and this is why she is being sought.

I am frankly tired of this kind of thing. When I married my wife who is a Brazilian we had to live apart for 10 months in order for her to enter the US legally we could not see each other and she had to stay in Brazil.

Why should this woman get special treatment but those of us who follow the law have to sacrifice?  I am not anti-immigrant my wife, mother, father are all immigrants but legal ones if you want open borders then pass a law to open the borders until then these are the laws we have in the US.

Illegal Immigrant Seeks Church Sanctuary To Avoid Deportation
Woman, 7-Year-Old Son Plan To Stay In West Side Church

CHICAGO -- An activist for illegal immigrants refused to show up for deportation Tuesday and instead claimed sanctuary in a Chicago church.

Elvira Arellano, 31, had been ordered to show up at Homeland Security's office in the Loop, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.

Arellano, who has been in the United States for nine years, took her young son to the St. Adalbert United Methodist Church at 2716 West Division. She is the president of a group that lobbies for the rights of families who face deportation. Her 7-year-old son is a U.S. citizen, according to the report.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said Arellano will be considered a fugitive if she refuses to surrender.
Arellano said she is prepared to stay inside the church until ICE agents arrest her.
Officials pointed out that Arellano has been deported once already and has also been convicted of using a fake Social Security number. She was arrested in 2002 in a post Sept. 11 illegal immigrant roundup at O'Hare.

Arellano has in the past received several stays of deportation, thanks in part to the help of local U.S. congressmen, and has been a vocal advocate for illegal immigrants.

goldencrimsonbrown      Webster's defines "This brilliantly planned and orchestrated crime" as:
  Mike and I talk Art in unsophisticated terms, which means we really talk art. I'm rolling my own cigarettes, and it snows shreds of goldencrimson brown flakes that expand when you breathe them in. Such is my desire to fill me with whatever air can offer. Leslie calls looking but I can't do much, clean my glasses with Windex thinking that maybe it's just my eyes, the soft edges of objects defining themselves but weakly, in kiwi Frankenstein. Mary reads Donald Barthelme's The Dead Father--I wonder what she thinks of such a scattered, fragile thing? Were those nightmares when I was a kid really about the dumpster behind Lakeview Elementary? I went walking down there the other night, stoned, listening on headphones to a music made without instruments, and the house my father died in creeped me out so much I hurried. Two mannish silhouettes will follow you. Why do I never share with anyone whatever seems sacred to me? You're tailed by two poolish eyes, glinting off the
 second-story window of the house my father died in. You're just right, Mary, because you too are restless inside, like really restless, and we share an gorgeous instability, raucous and ravening. Shaun Ryder raves on. You dreamed when you were a kid that you were a butterfly's man, and you moved volute wings via sexed pulleys via tracks.
  Mine. Mine mine mine.

Hi all,
I've been reading "Children of Albion" the last couple of days, and it has
come to my attention as i'm tracking down the names of some of the poets I
like in here that my knowledge of current poetry from the UK
is woefully lacking. I'm particularly enjoying Gael Turnbull and Adrian
Mitchell who I discovered here. Can anyone recommend any other poets from
Great Britain, particular Scots or Welsh poets? or good anthologies that
are more recent? I understand that there were some important poets left
out of Children of Albion that a lot of people thought should have been in
it, at least, so says wikipedia. Any recs for any of those?

thanks for all answers,
Jason

> my  favorite UK poet is ...

Given where Jason Quackenbush is starting from (Horovitz' +Children of
Albion+ in 1969), I'm not sure that an unadorned list of names is going to
be a terrible lot of use.

(Given the names coming up, and the overlap between them, more useful might
be the articles by Andrew Duncan [one of the names mantioned] published and
archived by Tim Allen's Terrible Works --

            http://www.terriblework.co.uk/author%20index.htm

There are both more names and more context there.)

But ...

There's nothing wrong with The Usual Suspects (and I'd add dave bircumshaw
to the list, partly because I publish him) but this is very much one
particular slice across contemporary poetry, sounding like the british-poets
list at its most voluble.

More specifically, Jason asked inter alia about Scottish Poetry in the
context of an anthology published in 1969.  So what was happening there in
1969?

By virtue of survival as well as talent, the finest living Scottish poet is
EDWIN MORGAN.  (+Selected Poems+ [Carcanet Press]) -- included, I note from
the Wikipedia article on it, in +Children of Albion+.

My own copy of that has gone walkabout at the moment so I can't check
exactly what was published by whom, but of the ones listed in Wikipedia ,
Libby Houston {English} and Ian Hamilton Finlay, as well as Edwin Morgan,
have progressed beyond 1969.

It's hardly fair to berate Horovitz for not including Veronica
Forrest-Thomson,  as hardly anyone had heard of her at that point.  Apart
from anything else, she was only twenty-two years old in 1969.  Her
+Collected Poems+ weren't published till 1990, fifteen years after her
death, and I think one of the few pamphlets she published before she died
was +Cordelia+ (published by Omens at a cost of 25p in 1974, and only 24
pages long).

She also, though this is pretty trivial all things considered, provides a
link between Edwin Morgan (who knew her in Glasgow) and J.H.Prynne whom she
met at Cambridge.

In 1969, Morgan wasn't particularly well known.  He'd published his first
substantial collection, +The Second Life+, the year before, but not to much
notice -- the Big Guns of his generation at that point in Scotland were
considered to be Norman McCaig, George Mackay Brown and Iain Crichton
Smith -- and it wasn't followed up till Carcanet took him on and he Became
Famous.  (There's a bit in the middle, and obviously more, but that's a
crude summary.)

1969 was also about two or three years after the Glasgow Language Wars broke
out, sparked-off by the publication by TOM LEONARD (mentioned by another
poster) of "Six Glasgow Poems".  Or rather, the sequence of publications and
republications ...

Partly why this is in my mind is that earlier tonight, before I read the set
of naked lists offered by various posters, I'd been leafing through some
stuff on my shelves with a couple of friends who were visiting me, and
noticed the first complete publication of "Six Glasgow Poems" (a cyclostyled
insert in a magazine called +Epos+), the reprint by Tom McGrath [himself one
of the contributors to +Children of Albion+], and their appearance in Tom's
first major selected -- +Intimate Voices+ (Galloping Dog Press, 1984,
reprinted), still the best place to start with Tom Leonard's poems.

Or there's the post by Robin Purves to this list only a day or two ago
announcing the availability of "Being a Human Being and other poems by Tom
Leonard."

There were [obviously] other things happening in Scotland in and around 1969
(I haven't even mentioned D.M.BLACK) but rather than listing
indiscriminately, there are three recent volumes that seem to me to
curiously echo it.

          Lydia Robb, +Last Tango with Magritte+ (Chapman, 2001)
          Kathleen Jamie, +Mr and Mrs Scotland Are Dead+ (Bloodaxe Books,
2002)
         Alison Flett, +Whit Lassyz Ur Inty+ (Thirsty Books, 2004)

It aw hings thegither.

+Chapman+ magazine, edited by Joy Hendry, is probably the best place to see
something of what's happening with Scottish poetry today.

Raymond, this woman may not have been able to
*afford*, as you apparently were (eventually, at
least), the EXORBITANT costs of immigration procedures
-- and that's without the legal counsel, which has
become almost necessary to avoid serious complications
in many instances (this formulation amounts to
euphemism). I speak from experience: my wife is
French. I feel immensely grateful for the privilege I
have (it's terribly sad to say, but it may have far
too much to do with being a white man married to a
Western European woman: I could tell you horrifying
stories...).
In short, and with all due respect, I find your
opinion somewhat indelicately expressed. Do you
presume to know this woman's story? I grant you, a
degree of skepticism may be in order: these kinds of
tales get spun one way (100% martyr, victim of evil
injustice) as often, perhaps, as they get spun in the
other (100% martyr-free, good-for-nothing illegal
immigrant lawbreaker).
In addition, you write this: "Why should this woman
get special treatment but those of us who follow
the law have to sacrifice?" This sounds a bit too much
like a translation for "I had to suffer, so everyone
else should too." Two wrongs apparently make a right?
Or am I misunderstanding you?
Permit me, then, to err on the side of charity, and
express my personal solidarity with this woman:
DOWN WITH THE US IMMIGRATION MACHINE.
It is an engine for all kinds of injustices,
especially now: it was built for those injustices from
the beginning.
Alex


Raymond Bianchi wrote:
"This woman entered the USA illegally after she was
deported and this is
why she is being sought.

I am frankly tired of this kind of thing. When I
married my wife who is
a Brazilian we had to live apart for 10 months in
order for her to
enter the US legally we could not see each other and
she had to stay in
Brazil.

Why should this woman get special treatment but those
of us who follow
the law have to sacrifice?  I am not anti-immigrant my
wife, mother,
father are all immigrants but legal ones if you want
open borders then
pass a law to open the borders until then these are
the laws we have in
the US."

Paul Green.

Check out "Directions to the Dead End" and "Gestalt Bunker" at
http://www.culturecourt.com/Audio/PG/PGaudio.htm . These are downloadable
audio pieces from the seventies and are some of the best recordings of
poetic works I've heard (and still sound like they could be contemporary).
Also check out the text of a recent radio play called "The Terminal Poet" at
http://www.greatworks.org.uk/poems/ttp.html :

"Poet Charles Kenning was once a darling of the literary world. Now a
drink-sodden wreck, he's holed up in an inner city high-rise, unaware that
agents of an American think-tank are monitoring his squalor. For both the
Helicon Foundation and the British Cabinet have a use for him in their
hi-tech struggle against urban anarchy and the strange powers of the Quantum
Slut Crew. . ."

Death on All Fronts

                         "The Planet is Finished"

A new moon looks down on our sick sweet planet
Orion's chased the Immovable Bear halfway across the sky
from winter to winter. I wake, earlier in bed, fly corpses
cover gas lit sheets, my head aches, left temple
brain fibre throbbing for Death I created on all Fronts.
Poisoned rats in the Chickenhouse and myriad lice
Sprayed with white arsenics filtering to the brook, City
             Cockroaches
stomped on Country kitchen floors. No babies for me.
Cut earth boy & girl hordes by half & breathe free
say Revolutionary expert Computers:
Half the blue globe's germ population's more than enough
keep the cloudy lung from stinking pneumonia.

Well, without thinking it through, my initial response is to say rather that far too much escapes the poetical. I would replace the word "poetical" as you used it below with "rhetorical," which maybe approaches the *broader* use of the term political I was referencing (you responded, however, as though I were using the term in its more commonplace, narrower valence). But then we're back to "ideological," which is perhaps (as I was arguing) inescapable. I think this circuity is endemic to the beast. So, I agree with you as long as we can agree on our terms, except that I don't think, as I started out saying, that we quite agree on the use of the word "poetical".... I would feel hesitant to place in any simple oppositional relation, discrete borders and all, the political/ideological and the poetical forms of language. I tend to allow myself the indulgence of believing that "poetic" language is, in fact, inherently more unstable/destabilizing because it foregrounds that
 aspect of language that kristeva has termed "semiotic" and is more polysemous. Maybe that's just what I need to think to give permission to the  utter self-indulgence of my artistic practice?? I'm ultimately mainly interested in poetry as a mode of desire/jouissance and do believe that that desire is in fact important to my life but does not necessarily conform or contribute directly to any socially positive, progressive agenda....

Because I was just considering teaching the Sonnets to Orpheus (and recently echoed it in a poem) (and because I've been reading Gass' book and am in love with it, as I am with Rilke generally these days) (little Disappointed Romantic that I am):

Singing is Being....
True singing is a different kind of breath.
A breath about nothing. A gust in the god. A wind.

Tod

Alex:

We had to endure questions like "is your wife going to work as a prostitute
in the US" because she is from Brazil so don't tell me about horrifying
stories. I paid the normal fees and worked without a lawyer for the
immigration of my wife and I was without funds at the time.

I guess that if a law is inconvienent just ignore It?

Which laws should we ignore?

How do we determine which ones to ignore?

One of the facts purposely left out of all this hand wringing is that this
person stole another person's Social Security number and the woman whose
number she stole was on radio here in Chicago and her number was used by
many people to get credit cards, loans and jobs her life was destroyed what
right does this "immigrant" have to do that?

Things are not black and white they are grey especially about immigration. I
would love to see a more humane system of immigration but stealing
identities and violating laws is not a road to justice

Subject: don't deport this woman, in re raymond bianchi

Raymond, this woman may not have been able to *afford*, as you apparently
were (eventually, at least), the EXORBITANT costs of immigration procedures
-- and that's without the legal counsel, which has become almost necessary
to avoid serious complications in many instances (this formulation amounts
to euphemism). I speak from experience: my wife is French. I feel immensely
grateful for the privilege I have (it's terribly sad to say, but it may have
far too much to do with being a white man married to a Western European
woman: I could tell you horrifying stories...).
In short, and with all due respect, I find your opinion somewhat
indelicately expressed. Do you presume to know this woman's story? I grant
you, a degree of skepticism may be in order: these kinds of tales get spun
one way (100% martyr, victim of evil
injustice) as often, perhaps, as they get spun in the other (100%
martyr-free, good-for-nothing illegal immigrant lawbreaker).
In addition, you write this: "Why should this woman get special treatment
but those of us who follow the law have to sacrifice?" This sounds a bit too
much like a translation for "I had to suffer, so everyone else should too."
Two wrongs apparently make a right?
Or am I misunderstanding you?
Permit me, then, to err on the side of charity, and express my personal
solidarity with this woman:
DOWN WITH THE US IMMIGRATION MACHINE.
It is an engine for all kinds of injustices, especially now: it was built
for those injustices from the beginning.

I am frankly tired of this kind of thing. When I
married my wife who is
a Brazilian we had to live apart for 10 months in
order for her to
enter the US legally we could not see each other and
she had to stay in
Brazil.

Why should this woman get special treatment but those
of us who follow
the law have to sacrifice?  I am not anti-immigrant my
wife, mother,
father are all immigrants but legal ones if you want
open borders then
pass a law to open the borders until then these are
the laws we have in
the US."

Ray,
Food for thought, thank you, Ray. I think your
skepticism, which leads you to pay attention to the
facts, is laudable, and as I noted, I'm not surprised
to hear there's a lot of misinformation about this
case. There always is with these things one way or the
other, it seems (see, interesting side note, the real
facts of the infamous
Coffee-burn-woman-sues-MacDonald's-scandal as revealed
by the author of Too Much Coffee Man...).
My response to your message had less to do with the
facts (or unfacts) of the particular case, and more
with the kind of rhetorical posture I felt you
adopted, certain expressions.... I do think it's a
pretty grey issue, as you say. I sure wish it were cut
and dried.
But the civil disobedience issue is more interesting
and important than this woman's case. I think, Ray,
that some laws that should be "ignored", in fact.
But I don't think this woman's actions have anything
to do with civil disobedience, really. Too much
self-interest without regard for consequences (ie,
destroying lives or whatever).
But for every woman like this one, I wonder if there
isn't another perfectly innocent victim of
deportation/immigration law who is unjustly prevented
from being with their families, and who isn't doing
anyone a whole lot of harm, in my view.
Anyway, I sympathize with your bad memories of US
immigration.
Yours,

I guess that if a law is inconvienent just ignore It?

Which laws should we ignore?

How do we determine which ones to ignore?

One of the facts purposely left out of all this hand
wringing is that
this
person stole another person's Social Security number
and the woman
whose
number she stole was on radio here in Chicago and her
number was used
by
many people to get credit cards, loans and jobs her
life was destroyed
what
right does this "immigrant" have to do that?

Things are not black and white they are grey
especially about
immigration. I
would love to see a more humane system of immigration
but stealing
identities and violating laws is not a road to justice

Once had a friend ask me: Why get something as
arbitary as an MFA? What are your thoughts? I am
making this decision at the moment and would
appreciate your thoughts - nails, wires, egos and all?
My background is in English, lots of experience in
film and cultural anthropology. I am a writer,
however, and do, or should I say, but do think myself
better suited to environment of rigerous intellectual
debate (chose not to use discourse) - for what I can
learn, the acrobatics of exchange, and then I think
I've got stuff to contribute, share.

   I think Nth Position (http://www.nthposition.com) might be the classiest online UK pub, kind of the JACKET of London. Great Works (http://www.greatworks.org.uk) is good too, and the Argotist (http://www.argotistonline.co.uk). "Stride" has some decent stuff on it as well.

--here are a few random, commonplace thoughts, reasons for (saving some
bucks) sticking with grad work in english and not going for an mfa -- with
the caveat that training in craft has to be found and worked somewhere but
there are other sources -- a just starting out poet like me doesn't need to
suck up to the mfa apparatus tho --
-- the money to pay mfa tuition can pay for good (random) short-term
workshops as well as travel to meet/hang with poets of other
cultures/traditions -- this is a lot more information-dense than a sterile
classroom -- San Christobal de las Casas used to have some expatriate poets
too, there are lots of places like this --
--i'm sure this has been said before but it's still true: in a classroom
setting a poem can become like an old dissected frog --  this is probably a
worst-case scenario even though in the best classrooms not so -- there's
always going to be a dead frog on the table that the poem is threatened with
becoming -- the academic claim to insight in the classroom dialogue i think
depends on the presence or ghost of this dead frog -- because we can kill
the poem if we need to, we can claim to gain understanding in the classroom
by priding ourselves on preserving the poem's life in the surgical theatre
-- i think it's a kind of sadism but that's just me
--a classroom setting limits what you can do -- you can't really "kick it"
because you're on an academic schedule with an academic hierarchy and
assignments/grades and what have you -- it's just this fake apparatus (or
worn-out theatre) and not poetry and not where poetry is going to come from
--
--this is just my opinion -- if you go for the mfa best of luck hope it's
not a waste of time and money
--there are a lot of really incredible, committed people in the university i
just don't think that's
where the poetry is -- where the poetry is, like everyone else i hope, i
wonder --
--i should probably have more coffee

i did both m.a. (and was lucky enough to have david bromige there for
that) and a ph.d. (that one starting as a creative and ending as a
research dissertation--darn!).  i started out because i write and wanted
more discipline around it.  the whole thing was amazing at letting me know
i'm not stupid but, except for david, found no one i could work with on my
poetry (sorry susan, i know i could have worked with you, but was already
too discouraged by others in the department), and now here i sit trying to
get back into the writing i really want to do.  if you know enough to pick
the right program, i think it could work well.  best, gabe

It's odd, but an MFA is still considered a terminal degree. An MA is not. So
... it makes a huge difference if you're not going to get further degrees
and want to teach (at least in MFA programs).

Gabrielle,

I appreciate that your description of your programs hints at a kind of
outsiderness --

--but if i required a classroom to keep my work going (and among scientists
that's a very respectable claim to make, Feynman was among those who said
this) -- but i'd quit right now if a classroom were necessary to write --
it's too expensive and then i'd be working to pay off tuition bills instead
of writing anyway

Tod wrote that he

 >>would feel hesitant to place in any simple oppositional
relation, discrete borders and all, the
political/ideological and the poetical forms of language. I
tend to allow myself the indulgence of believing that
"poetic" language is, in fact, inherently more
unstable/destabilizing because it foregrounds that
  aspect of language that kristeva has termed "semiotic" and
is more polysemous.



Understood. One can however speak of trend sin language.

My views are more influenced by Paul Ricoeur than by
Kristeva or the Lacanians. Like Ricoeur, I view the poetic
narrative (the rhetorical, the poetical, et al.) as a
transitional form between description and prescription. It
is the prescriptive that we identify with politics, whether
in its application to parties and causes or in its broader
cultural sense.

Further, poetry, unlike politics even in its broadest sense,
encourages one to see oneself as another. (By seeing oneself
as another, I do not mean the merely emblematic and
self-congratulatory forms of public empathy that politics
encourages toward the "oppressed" or "marginalized.")

Ricoeur argues that to see oneself as another is related to
seeing another as oneself. To see another as oneself may be
to transcend oneself. Here is one of the aspects of what I
referred to as "the poetical"; this is what makes poetical
narrative larger than politics.

Politics pulls inward. It stress what is not-self. (Narrowly
again, Henry Adams said American politics is the art of
organizing hatred.) Poetic narrative pulls outward toward
real, rather than merely prescriptive, empathy.

Anyway, some thoughts. I'm also fond of the Orpheus Sonnets
and have never found a suitable English translation. Perhaps
David Young's (who also does a superb Duino Elegies
translation) may be top on my list.

Best to all,
Eric Yost

agreed.  also, included in the original post a reference to this woman
being like rosa parks, thats offensive horseshit, its sad to see things
get turned into a playground where people's emotions are messed with. sure
immigration laws need to change but not through the actions of an identity
theiving illegal immigrant.

Dear All,
Say it ain't so. Summer's come and gone, virtually, and with it our
stint at McNally Robinson. But let it not be said that we didn't go
out with a bang [tell possum, a bang not a whimper--though don't
compare us to Mussolini]. This Wednesday, we feature two of our fair
city's favorite poetic sons, Matvei Yankelevich and Jordan Davis.
It's
going to be a real blowout, so don't miss it.

MATVEI YANKELEVICH is a volunteer editor at Ugly Duckling
Presse. He translates from Russian (Daniil Kharms,
Alexander Vvedensky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and others). His
long poem, "The Present Work," is becoming available in
chapbook form thanks to Palm Press. He is the co-translator
of "OBERIU: An Anthology of Russian Absurdism" just out
this summer from Northwestern University Press. His
translations of the works of Daniil Kharms are forthcoming
in 2007 from Ardis/Overlook.

JORDAN DAVIS is the host of The Million Poems Show, a live poetry
talk
show. In April, he hosted the first Flarf Festival at the Medicine
Show Theater. With Chris Edgar, he edits the literary journal *The
Hat*, and along with Sarah Manguso, edited the anthology *Free
Radicals: American Poets before Their First Books*. He has written
about poetry for Vanitas, the Village Voice and Fence's
ConstantCritic.com site, and his poems are forthcoming in Volt and
the
Boston Review. His second collection of poems will be published
later
this year.

See you all there,

Dear AG,
What are your goals? I have a MA from Brown in
Creative Writing/Poetry. The next year they changed
the designation to an MFA. Strange eh? It just goes to
show you how close the 2 are. The program I was in is
a 2 year intensive workout that focuses on your
creative process. The writing seminars push you to try
new forms, it rattles your patterns, and makes/helps
you define/articulate your poetics, perspective and
purpose. Brown U. has small sections of fiction,
playwriting, and poetry. I saw one of my fellows get
crushed under the scutiny, another go on to a PHD
another to NYC...I believe a MA has specific language
requirements, and may require other things too. My
language requirement was fulfilled by taking a lit
course in the lang dept. I think the distinction
between a MFA and an MA is the MFA is more
art/creative oriented, and the MA is more objective,
scholarly oriented. I would suggest that you see where
the writers that you admire are teaching. Brown has
Michael Harper, Keith Waldrop, C.D. Wright, Mei Mei
Berssenburge was there for a semester.. Charles
Bernstein (!) came for a visit and spoke with us.
Also, I would investigate the financial aid
possibilites at the schools you are considering. I was
able to teach and was paid very well. Let me know if I
can help you with any other questions.

peace,
Audrey Berry

Dear AG,
Let me know where on the landscape you spot this
openness, for I am looking for it myself. It seems
that it is easy for all to talk about form, but it is
messy business to talk about content; even riskier to
venture into spirit. Artists can discuss form, and
recognize when the top of their head comes off with
content..spirit/vocation is soul work..is the
generative procreative foodstuff.

Some on this list might be interested in a recent video made of a
performance installation by Allison Rentz. This performance took place
in Atlanta at the Contemporary (used to be Nexus Gallery connected with
Nexus Press). I saw this performance five times in one week and it was
beautiful, thought provoking, allegorical, mysterious and worth seeing
more times than five. The following video is large, and it is a 12
minute condensed version of what often took nearly an hour to perform.
Sadly, given this venue, most of her texts (which are poems) do not
survive the condensing needed to reach this length.

 >>POV: we've had enough of greek myths
=====================================

http://enjoyment.independent.co.uk/books/features/article1218972.ece
We've had enough of Greek myths
The poetry establishment needs black and Asian writers to invigorate a
tired old scene, argues Bernardine Evaristo

Fewer than one per cent of all poets published by the mainstream poetry
presses in Britain are black or Asian. You'd think it was the 1940s or
1950s but no, it's the 21st century. What is going on?

In 2004, I was asked to be one of the judges of Next Generation Poets, a
major promotion to find the 20 most interesting poets who had published
a first collection since 1994, organised by the Poetry Book Society. To
my dismay this revealed that in the past ten years only a handful of
poets of colour had broken through into print. This was in marked
contrast to the 1970s and 1980s when, in a climate of pioneering social
activism, many poets with roots in the Caribbean, such as John Agard,
Grace Nicols, Jean "Binta" Breeze, E A Markham and Linton Kwesi Johnson
were first published, often by small, independent presses.

When the prestigious Next Generation Poets list was finally announced,
only one black poet made it: Patience Agbabi.

The Arts Council quickly responded to lobbying and commissioned a
report, "Free Verse", which has just been published. Produced by Spread
the Word Literature Development Agency, the report shows that all the
editors of major presses are white and male. This might not be a huge
surprise in our "feminism is so yesterday" society, but most fiction
editors are also white, and this has not stopped them successfully
publishing fiction which draws on many cultures.

When poetry editors were questioned about their selection criteria for
publishing poets, they unanimously declared it was based on quality,
irrespective of race or gender. Ah, "quality" - as if it exists outside
the context of history, culture, literary traditions and values, all
ingredients which constitute personal taste. As poets of colour are not
being published, the message is received loud and clear: they're not
good enough. In the past that was said about black people who wanted to
be footballers, actors, novelists, golfers, judges, pilots and politicians.

Many poetry editors fiercely guard their independence. Elitism is not a
dirty word in the poetry world, it's a badge of pride. No one in the
arts wants to be told what to produce, yet if the status quo goes
unchallenged, nothing changes. I can hear the foot- stamping already.
No! You can't make me!

But it's about time those cast-iron doors were opened so that the poetry
industry is transformed into one which is more inclusive and
representative. (Oh, how dreadfully PC of me.)

The published poetry scene actually needs an injection of alternative
histories, cultures and stories. Haven't we had enough of the same old
same old: my childhood memories; my mildly dysfunctional parents; my
repressed grandparents; Greek myths; my last lover; my new lover; my
love of nature; more Greek myths; my holidays in foreign lands.

Moniza Alvi, one of Britain's most established poets, told me: "Poetry
that reflects a changing Britain is still badly represented in the
mainstream. We are deprived of black and Asian voices who would bring
fresh air to British poetry. I do believe this is beginning to change.
The space now given to poetry in translation in the Poetry Society's
journal Poetry Review is a welcome indication of this."

One of the major features of the "Free Verse" report is the predominance
of performance poetry as a popular outlet for poets of colour. The most
high-profile poets are those who know how to work a live audience. Yet
it has reached the stage when "Black Poetry" has become synonymous with
performance poetry which, although it has its own production and
literary values, doesn't always have the texture, depth and nuance to
withstand scrutiny on the page. While performance poetry continues to
flourish, as it should, it is the written legacy which will form the
future canon and eventually survive a poet's own life.

In 2005, I was one of the judges of the National Poetry Competition, run
by the Poetry Society and sponsored by The Independent on Sunday. As I
sifted through thousands of poems, I noted that almost none of them
seemed to draw inspiration from black or Asian cultures. This could mean
that such poets are not submitting their work; that the climate of
exclusion has led to a certain defeatism. If poets don't see themselves
reflected in the culture around them, then they think the culture is not
for them. Yet the solution is not to opt out, but to be tenacious and to
keep engaging. The competition, judged anonymously, is genuinely open to
everyone.

The enterprising poet and editor Nii Parkes set up his own poetry
imprint, mouthmark, a year ago, in keeping with the traditions of the
black, women's, gay and socialist presses of the 1970s which were formed
for the very same reason - a culture of exclusion. Just recently one of
his poets, Jacob Sam La Rose, was made the Poetry Book Society's
pamphlet choice for his first chapbook Communion. A vindicated Parkes
states: "When you start beating major publishers to awards, they can't
dismiss your editorial standards or the quality of the writers you publish."

But while setting up alternative publishers is a welcome necessity, it
shouldn't let the industry off the hook. The talented young poet Daljit
Nagra is only the third poet of colour to be deemed worthy of
publication by the venerable Faber and Faber in its 75-year history.
(Hallelujah!) His first collection, Look We Have Coming to Dover, is
published in February 2007. Nagra chose the well-trodden career path for
poets pre-publication which is to submit to competitions and magazines.
He found that "Magazines and competitions seems mostly to be run by the
white establishment so that little cultural variety is ever fully
appreciated. At that same time new black and Asian poets currently lack
support to enable them to develop their skills on the page."

To this end Spread the Word will soon launch an important two-year
programme to develop more poets to publication. Called "The Complete
Works", it will offer mentoring, workshops and seminars to poets who are
at the stage where they can produce a publishable collection within the
next few years. Then they'll go knocking, and let's hope the editors
will lower the drawbridge, slide back the lock on those medieval doors
and begin a two-way conversation with Britain's 21st century
multicultural demographic.

I don't know the Ricoeur. Someone just suggested the book I'm guessing you're referencing (Self As Other, or something like that). I'll have to take a look. You wrote: "Poetic narrative pulls outward toward real, rather than merely prescriptive, empathy." Would this only be true of narrative writing, or would that be reading too literally? But then how are you using the term "narrative"? What then of the (even "post-Language new") lyric?

Best,
Tod

Tod wrote that he

 >>would feel hesitant to place in any simple oppositional
relation, discrete borders and all, the
political/ideological and the poetical forms of language. I
tend to allow myself the indulgence of believing that
"poetic" language is, in fact, inherently more
unstable/destabilizing because it foregrounds that
  aspect of language that kristeva has termed "semiotic" and
is more polysemous.



Understood. One can however speak of trend sin language.

My views are more influenced by Paul Ricoeur than by
Kristeva or the Lacanians. Like Ricoeur, I view the poetic
narrative (the rhetorical, the poetical, et al.) as a
transitional form between description and prescription. It
is the prescriptive that we identify with politics, whether
in its application to parties and causes or in its broader
cultural sense.

Further, poetry, unlike politics even in its broadest sense,
encourages one to see oneself as another. (By seeing oneself
as another, I do not mean the merely emblematic and
self-congratulatory forms of public empathy that politics
encourages toward the "oppressed" or "marginalized.")

Ricoeur argues that to see oneself as another is related to
seeing another as oneself. To see another as oneself may be
to transcend oneself. Here is one of the aspects of what I
referred to as "the poetical"; this is what makes poetical
narrative larger than politics.

Politics pulls inward. It stress what is not-self. (Narrowly
again, Henry Adams said American politics is the art of
organizing hatred.) Poetic narrative pulls outward toward
real, rather than merely prescriptive, empathy.

Anyway, some thoughts. I'm also fond of the Orpheus Sonnets
and have never found a suitable English translation. Perhaps
David Young's (who also does a superb Duino Elegies
translation) may be top on my list.

Best to all,

The claim that poetry and politics are essentially opposed is a sigh of resignation that wants to make itself universal.

In a recent workshop on "Poetry and the News" (given at Woodland Pattern in  Milwaukee), Kerri Sonnenberg put some emphasis on the value of "vulnerability" for poetry that concerns itself with politics. The explicit suggestion was that a political poem is more likely to appeal to/reach a reader if the poet doesn't seem to already know the answers to her questions (and, therefore, if the poem raises questions-- this said with the caveat that a totally open indecisiveness that anyone can feel comfortable with is NOT what's being recommended). There are a number of appealing things about this notion and the ways it can be expanded.

For one thing, "vulnerability," leaving oneself open to error and to multiple possible solutions (and to more interesting problems than the ones we're handed--and, because of all this, to attack), seems to me to be an essential ethical concept at this time, when we've suffered through almost five years of a relentless emphasis on "security." Support for the all-out "war on terror" has been (especially since 9/11) based largely on an insistence on the right to a total safety; do I need to point out that this safety is factually impossible? That nothing whatsoever can ensure an absolute safety on any scale? In the face of this, the demand for invulnerability amounts to a sociopathic paranoia. This is as true on the interpersonal scale as it is on the global. Letting vulnerability be is one way of removing oneself from power relations whose tendency is to reproduce themselves (indefinetely deferring their own impossible satisfaction), and whose consequences are brutal.

Recently, as part of an ongoing investigation of her book "The Fatalist," I watched a Kelly Writers' House talk given by Lyn Hejinian (archived on the PennSound site), in which she discusses the "open text" explicitly in terms of the contrary desire for closure, again in reference to 9/11. She identifies the need to close the narrative begun by the events of that day as one of the major political crises of our day. Too often the idea of "openness" in poetry is oversimplified (made vague and broad) and caricatured, mostly by people who want to take a swipe at "LangPo," and can do so by not examining the actual work of those writers, but instead taking one or two sentences from an essay written in the late '70's and riffing on that. In her talk, Hejinian proposes one of many specific kinds and functions of openness (the "rejection of closure" for crucial political reasons) in poetic writing.

Openness and vulnerability. Poetry is a comparatively safe place to practice these.  Even a prescriptive political poetry (isn't this an unlikely term? who will have their politics prescribed by a poem? "no-one listens to poetry") can allow its prescriptions to include their own cracks, uncertainties, provisionalities, tactical transiences, the new questions and problems raised by those very solutions offered as prescriptions. Vulnerability means maintaining a space for an active, thinking listening in the face of the insistent beat of rectitude that can only be heard and absorbed.

Dear All, esp Roger and Michael,
I wonder what you think happens then..certainly poetry
is larger than A religion, but poetry is a form of
seeking, is TRUTH too dangerous a word? Not a
definitive form of God, but the discovering of God.
Saying that religion is a party uniform, a code, etc.
is one view and certainly a view that unfortunately
exists; it can also be a discipline (not everyone is a
fundamentalist). Only extreme fringes "tell us who to
hate, who to love"; most aim toward love, (is that
too, a dangerous word?) The best political poems and
the best religious poems are written in the middle of
being consumed---not from the outside--not for
ego--not for effect.

In my view this is completely misguided. Poems are art; they're
artifacts of human invention, entirely subjective, as prone to error
politically or religiously or in any other way as any other human
attempt to communicate -- even the best of them, because we know from
history that what's in the category "the best of them" changes
depending on who's doing the categorizing. Not only is the production
of poems subjective, the judging of poems is subjective, too. There's
even profound disagreement about what constitutes "a poem".

Poetry is NOT "a form of seeking truth" nor an "aim toward love";
poetry is a rhetorical means that can be used to seek truth, aim
toward love, or lie to you or create hate. There is nothing
inherently truth-seeking or love-aiming about poetry, any more than
there is anything inherently brain-poking or gut-tearing about a tree
limb. Oh, sure, you can USE it for a lot of different purposes, but
how you use it determines what we call it. So we can have "religious
poetry" as well as "good religious poetry" and "bad religious poetry"
and (mostly) "mediocre religious poetry".

Poetry is, in fact, almost always a banal or cliched notion dressed
up for presentation in the voice and style of the poet -- and it is
the voice and style of the poet that makes it poetry, NOT "what it
says" or even "what it means". What makes it poetry is HOW it is
said, and not WHAT is said. Poetry is not philosophy, not even close.
The entire point of poetry is the form, not the content; poetry is
all form -- content is merely whatever commonplace is conventional in
a given poet's social circle, or the social circle by which he or she
aspires to be accepted.

One may certainly seek love or truth, but poetry is not a means to
truth or love. Poetry is only one means among many of presenting what
one believes to be the truth, or a truth -- or a lie, or a partial
truth, or a joke, or whatever. Poetry is a means, not an end, and as
a means, it is neither good for every end nor worthy of being treated
as an end. Treating a means as an end is the easiest way to make some
other profound mistakes. Be careful.

I believe Wilhelm Reich (not that he is the last word) wrote that art is
made not from within the box or outside of the box but in getting out of the
box. Of course there are all kinds of poetry in all countries, each w/ its
own greatness.

That's a really fine post about poetry. I agree with much of it, but not
with the notion that "What makes it poetry is HOW it is said, and not WHAT
is said." Although I agree that it's "almost always a banal or cliched
notion dressed up for presentation in the voice and style of the poet."

Poetry is permitted a degree of ambiguity that is not permitted or perhaps
appropriate, normally, in other forms of writing. Just exactly what it means
is often impossible to say, though it may suggest many meanings.

In this sense, poetry is not simply all style or form, but a way of being,
at times, profoundly vague. "HOW it is said" is of course very important to
being able to work amid such multi-valenced language toward something other
than word salad, but poems can proceed in many directions at once, and this
is not simply a matter of how it is said, but of what is said. Sort of like
the difference between saying x=3 and P(x)=3 where P(x) is a polynomial of
degree n, so that it will have n solutions, although some might be imaginary
or 'complex'. But not really like that, because the solutions of a
polynomial can normally all be ascertained, whereas what a poem means is, to
some extent, a matter of what you make of it, and this is a different type
of meaning than is normally appropriate in other forms of writing.

yes, poetry is an art form first and last, just as music is. yet it can give
solace, lead the way to transcendence, display decadence, revolt, disgust,
fail to do anything, effect each person differently, etc. To me the LangPo
group is essential bec they are part of one American vein from Whitman &
Stein to Wms & Black Mtn to the Objectivists, each adding to the American
voice or showing us what keeps us in the box in which we think & speak. Yet
each of those poets is her/his own person, too large to fit into any
category. Finally, the sound of poem is paramount in creating meaning in
some poets. And maybe all these generalities are beside the point when we
read and listen. The individual voice is heard, yet PoMo questions the
individual voice. Discussions worth having, then giving up & just listening.
Some poetry is meant to be seen, some to be heard. A friend says he reads
Dickinson so he can hear her voice in his mind.

I agree with both Audrey and Marcus, to an extent, and don't see their views as opposed as Marcus seems to see them. I would agree that poetry is not automatically or inherently any particular thing. I also tend towards Marcus' very Russian Formalist view of poetry, but not to the extinct of disclaiming the existence or importance of content absolutely. Certainly the form "speaks" (like the symptom). I think ala Lacan and Badiou that truth exists and is both subjective and (formally) universal--that truth is what precipitates subjectivity over and against the otherwise docile ego, in need of its protections, etc. In this context we could perhaps reinvigorate the crusty cliche, "the truth will set you free" (though on second thought, why would we?). I'm just starting to read Badiou, really, and can't yet discuss his work with any intelligence.  It seems very exciting. There's a nifty little summary of his work at the European Grad School site you could check out, though it
 may not make much sense if you haven't already read some of his writing, but maybe: http://www.egs.edu/faculty/badiou.html . I do think poetry is about truth, but in a way that redefines or necessitates the redefining of truth. "Badiou distinguishes four general fields of truth, or four domains of subjectivation (which in turn operate as the four generic 'conditions' of philosophy itself): politics, science, art and love." I have to read more Badiou.... And though poetry and philosophy are different, I would say that they are a lot more alike than Marcus seems to think. (Sorry if I rambled incoherently.)

In my view this is completely misguided. Poems are art; they're
artifacts of human invention, entirely subjective, as prone to error
politically or religiously or in any other way as any other human
attempt to communicate -- even the best of them, because we know from
history that what's in the category "the best of them" changes
depending on who's doing the categorizing. Not only is the production
of poems subjective, the judging of poems is subjective, too. There's
even profound disagreement about what constitutes "a poem".

Poetry is NOT "a form of seeking truth" nor an "aim toward love";
poetry is a rhetorical means that can be used to seek truth, aim
toward love, or lie to you or create hate. There is nothing
inherently truth-seeking or love-aiming about poetry, any more than
there is anything inherently brain-poking or gut-tearing about a tree
limb. Oh, sure, you can USE it for a lot of different purposes, but
how you use it determines what we call it. So we can have "religious
poetry" as well as "good religious poetry" and "bad religious poetry"
and (mostly) "mediocre religious poetry".

Poetry is, in fact, almost always a banal or cliched notion dressed
up for presentation in the voice and style of the poet -- and it is
the voice and style of the poet that makes it poetry, NOT "what it
says" or even "what it means". What makes it poetry is HOW it is
said, and not WHAT is said. Poetry is not philosophy, not even close.
The entire point of poetry is the form, not the content; poetry is
all form -- content is merely whatever commonplace is conventional in
a given poet's social circle, or the social circle by which he or she
aspires to be accepted.

One may certainly seek love or truth, but poetry is not a means to
truth or love. Poetry is only one means among many of presenting what
one believes to be the truth, or a truth -- or a lie, or a partial
truth, or a joke, or whatever. Poetry is a means, not an end, and as
a means, it is neither good for every end nor worthy of being treated
as an end. Treating a means as an end is the easiest way to make some
other profound mistakes. Be careful.

i agree.  and in fact by the time i'd finished my dissertation, my
creative writing had gone underground quite a bit.  but i did love the
collaborations and appreciation with david.  aye, and here i sit looking
at student loan debt at this late age of mine.  maybe i can plead
decrepitude if i put it off long enough...  :-)  and, indeed, i cannot say
it was a wasted time.  i changed i changed.  gabe

Andy wrote: For one thing, "vulnerability," leaving oneself
open to error and to multiple possible solutions (and to
more interesting problems than the ones we're handed--and,
because of all this, to attack), seems to me to be an
essential ethical concept at this time, when we've suffered
through almost five years of a relentless emphasis on
"security." Support for the all-out "war on terror" has been
(especially since 9/11) based largely on an insistence on
the right to a total safety; do I need to point out that
this safety is factually impossible? That nothing whatsoever
can ensure an absolute safety on any scale? In the face of
this, the demand for invulnerability amounts to a
sociopathic paranoia.


Substitute "security" for "invulnerability" and you have the
content of one of ee cummings' _Six Nonlectures_. And it's
easy to agree with much of what Andy writes.

However, look at the movement in the passage above. When
Andy connects poetry to politics, when he expands
Sonnenberg's comments about vulnerability in political poems
to politics itself, his prose immediately becomes dead
certain, almost alarmist.

See how the passage moves? No longer are we "vulnerable" to
"possible solutions." Instead, we are facing "sociopathic
paranoia."

This is NOT to demean the merits of Andy's argument; rather
I want to underscore how the movement toward political
speech is a movement toward sure answers and certitude. The
passage does not offer any vulnerability to possible
justifications for the demand for security. Instead we have
the certain knowledge that we are living through a social
"insistence on the right to a total safety."

That may or may not be. The point is the way language
changes in the political--from the meditative to the
rallying cry.

"Philosophy ought only to be written as a form of poetry."
~Ludwig Wittgenstein

Marjorie Perloff asserts the compliment, that Postry ought to be written only
as a form of philosophy, in Wittgenstein's ladder saying it follows from the
first, which it doesn't, but oh well, if you go through life expecting valid
moves of logic from critics, you're going to be very disappointed.

I'm bringing this up because i think there's a tendency for people to want to
connect poetry to something "deeper" and casting about for that "something
deep" they light naturally on philosophy because philosophy is confusing and
weird and decorated with all sorts of erudition besides, and if you don't
understand it but intelligent people seem to, then it must be deep, right?
except that's a trap that could lead one to assert that star trek the next
generation is deep. It is not, nor is philosophy.

What's my point? Poetry is entertainment. That's all it's ever been. It's a way
of holding the attention of an audience in order to communicate something.
That's my biggest beef with language poetry and a lot of the composite sleight
of hand stuff that is going on in the neo-concrete poetry/digital
poetry/conceptual poetry/vispo people in the wake of the american tree.  For
some reason it's become acceptable in the pursuit of poetry as political
statement or piece of high art to ignore it's function as entertainment and in
the process completely disregard immediacy as a measure of quality. Granted,
immediacy can be construed as a function of literacy, but only up to a point.

Once one has moved beyond the general familiarity with a canon and a tradition
that is to be expected of someone engaged in a literature, the criteria of
immediacy returns and only so much obliqueness and "openness" to a text can be
tolerated before one has to say that it is boring and stupid. There is a lot of
boring, stupid work in the world, and I think a general disdain for a certain
amount of immediacy is the result. At some point early in the twentieth
century, and I think Ezra Pound is largely to be blamed for this in
poetry--although it is certainly not limited to that, a contrapopular "high
art" meta-aesthetic was instituted that, whatever else was going on in various
movements, can be traced over the course of the development of various american
arts. When I say meta-aesthetic, I'm referring to what is obvious in the work
of the rank and file priests, monks, and nuns, and not the stated aims of the
bishops and cardinals following from the likes of Pound, Picasso, and
Schoenberg.

I think that a large percentage of work that is trying to be adventurous has
chosen obscurantism and obfuscation in place of immediacy as a means of
concealing the work's essentially anemic semantics. It has been allowed to do
so largely because to the uninitiated, work that is adventurous is often
indistinguishable from work that is incomprehensible. I think this is the sort
of problem that leads lesser light like Kenneth Goldsmith to say things like
"The 20th century avant-garde liked to embrace boredom as a way of getting
around what it considered to be the vapid "excitement" of popular culture."
Nonsense. The twentieth century avant-garde is full of exciting work, not the
least of which most of the output of Goldsmith's "king of boredom" Jackson Mac
Low. people who think that all there is to adventurous work is to strip the
work of the immediacy (the immediacy that is present in unadventurous work
through it's cliche nature) are missing the boat completely. To be disoriented
by a work and to have to figure out how to address it, is not to say that the
work shouldn't try to compel it's viewer or reader to try to address it. That's
one of the chief functions of the size of abstract expressionist paintings, to
pick an oft misunderstood example. A rothko, were it the size of a postage
stamp, would suck because it could easily be ignored. But rothko's enormous
canvases demand attention, as do Mac Low's "twenties" poems to give an example
from poetry, works i return to constantly not because they are obscure or
because i expect to find something deep there, but because i still don't know
quite how to describe how they make me feel. I don't know how they do it, but
they draw me back and demand that I deal with them on some level. I think part
of it has to do with the fact that one is forced to read aloud repeating
phrases over and over again trying to get the silences timed right. But it's
such a cunning trick on Mac Low's part to force the reader into that. It gives
a work that might otherwise be meaningless, pretentious, and obfuscating it's
own boringness, an immediacy that isn't, ironically, immediately apparent.

I'm not sure what i'm talking about anymore or how it relates to the thread so
I'm gonna shut up now.

Writing Experiments Workshop
Dodie Bellamy

This fall I will be leading a writing experiments workshop, which
will meet 11 Monday evenings, from 7 to 10 p.m.  The dates:
September 25 through December 4.  Cost: $350, with a $100 deposit due
by September 18.

Each week students will be assigned a short take-home writing
experiment which they will share with the class the following week.
Assignments will range from cut ups to exploring bodily sensations.
Each week we will also critique longer pieces by two students.
Students may bring in anything they want (up to 20 pages) for the
longer critiques.  Depending on the length, these longer pieces will
be read aloud in class or handed out a week ahead of time.  Though
this class will have a prose focus, it is cross-genre, and poets are
welcome.  The class is limited to 9 students.  Lots and lots of
personal attention.  It takes place in San Francisco, in my South of
Market apartment, which comes complete with snacks and two cats.

This is a good class for poets wanting to play around with narrative
or prose writers wanting to open up their prose.  It will be the last
workshop I'll be doing for a while.

Pink Steam, my collection of fiction, memoir, and memoiresque essays,
was published in 2004 by San Francisco's Suspect Thoughts Press.  My
vampire novel, The Letters of Mina Harker was reprinted by University
of Wisconsin Press, also in 2004.  Academonia, a book of essays, is
forthcoming from Krupskaya late fall.  I'm the author of 3 other
books and I teach creative writing at SF State and in the MFA program
at Antioch Los Angeles.  I've also taught at CalArts, Naropa summer
session, Mills, USF, UC Santa Cruz, and the SF Art Institute.  I've
received the Bay Guardian Goldie Award for Literature and the
Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Poetry.

If you're interested, please email about work samples, etc.  Or--if
you know anybody who might be interested, please pass this email
along to them.  If you're interested do contact me promptly.
Preference given to those not currently enrolled in a grad writing
program.

One year after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, the region
remains in shambles. The US government has left the citizens of
Louisiana and Mississippi to fend for themselves, failing even to
pass a resolution to honor the upcoming anniversary of the
hurricane's landfall. The re-building effort has largely fallen on
the shoulders of devoted non-profit relief organizations, notably
Common Ground Relief which is active in New Orleans and across the
Gulf Coast. While many of these relief organizations are
approaching the pre-determined end of their ministries, Common
Ground Relief has resolved to continue working in the Gulf Coast
until the region has fully recovered. To honor and assist with
their efforts, the New York Poetry community is coming together on
AUGUST 26 at THE BOWERY POETRY CLUB. The event will feature poets
and activists, including PROFESSOR ARTURO, ED SANDERS,JOHN GIORNO,
SAPPHIRE, MICHAEL FORD, MARCELLA DURAND, NATHANIEL A.SIEGEL, JUSTIN
LACOUR, FRANK SHERLOCK, HARRIS SCHIFF, HAL SIROWITZ,
AMY OUZOONIAN, and TASHA ROBBINS, along with New Orleans style
jazz,and blues from singer DOROTHY GOODMAN and the band CAVE CANEM.
There will be Cajun food for sale, as well as art from Gulf Coast
artists; all proceeds being directed to Common Ground Relief. The
event will be an opportunity for New York to display its continuing
solidarity with the city of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.

there is no "high" art at all would be my point. just hoity toity snobs who, because of their money and backgrounds have power, and ergo think they are better than other people, and so therefore their cultural effluvia is "higher" than other cultures simply by virtue of it's having been made by one of them. On the other end of the spectrum arthur danto says there isn't even art anymore. it's all just doss. i disagree. but i do think it's dumb to become so elitist and insular that no one beyond a small group of people who've read the same books you've read can understand what you're doing, let alone WANT to understand what you're doing. And that's where think of any thing as "high" or "low" art gets you. Is comic book writer Alan Moore's woork vastly qualitatively superior to poet Robert Pinsky's0? you're goddamn right it is. And I'd rather spend an afternoon with a moore book than a pinsky unless somebody was paying me to read the guy.

Dear Eric,

You're quite right to point out the drift toward bald
assertion here, and in political discourse at large (it's
also there in conversation, and in posts to this listserv,
that have nothing to do with politics). I'm glad you
picked up on it; I thought about it myself just before
sending the message.

My discomfort is with the implication, in your response,
that political discourse has to go this way. I think it
should be viewed as an unsolved problem rather than a
matter of essence. Here are a few thoughts in reply:

Vulnerability clearly takes practice, and I certainly
don't claim to be a virtuoso. Right from the start, it's
difficult to figure out how to do it, partly
because there's no support for it. Since there are
threats of all kinds to our self-esteem, the things
we value, our personal safety and our very lives, leaving
oneself open can seem like a foolish strategy. And it
could be one. I'd never want to deny the validity of
the desire for safety and security, or even for closure
(never landing wears on you after awhile).

The most pertinent unanswered question, it seems to me, is:
how can a vulnerability be cultivated that doesn't dispense
with ethical committment, or compromise it seriously? The
end of my post is so assertive, so insistent on its own
truth, because to be softer, more pliant with regard to
the situation I describe seems to me like a betrayal
of, not just my ethical principles, but of the people
whose lives are destroyed by the stance I'm objecting to.
(Admittedly, I'm usually more cautious about the language
of certainty,for the very reason that that rhetorical
posture shuts people down, making it unlikely that they'll
reflect on the consequences of the attitude I'm trying to
call into question). I would like to distinguish, though,
between my language there, which does fail to do what I'm
generally hoping for, and what I'm criticizing, which has
as its very goal a total closure, and which wants its
statements backed up militarily.

In any case, as I said in the earlier
post, "vulnerability" can't mean a wishy-washy "I'm Ok, you're
ok" attitude, or else it isn't an ethical principle at
all, but a way of avoiding the problem that's just as
much of a dead end as the insistence on winning, on
setting the balance straight, on achieving closure.

I'm sure you noticed that the earlier sentences in my
post were longer and more complex, whereas the most
explicitly political ones were comparatively condensed
and simple--as if vulnerability (and poetry?) called
for meandering, for conditionalizing, clarifying,
cautious attempts to avoid misunderstanding, while
ethical commitment called for incisive insistence,
a language that doesn't invite debate. On the one
hand, this has to do with my own experience; writing
political poetry that's good both aesthetically and
politically is hard, and figuring out what I think
about the war on terror is not hard. On the other hand,
I do think it points to an inherent problem.

It's likely that solutions (and more interesting problems)
are to be found in relation to particular instances. In
a poem, this might mean that there are points at which
certainty is very much in evidence--and maybe the vulnerability
would lie in ways of making sure that that certainty doesn't
dominate the poem--that things are opened up that aren't
closed. This would be a particular case of a relationship
between specificity/determinateness and openness in poetry
generally.

In a political argument--let's say it's about 9/11 and what
happened after--no matter how understanding I am (genuinely,
or merely rhetorically), there will always be someone who
feels that my opposition to the "war on terror" amounts to
a dismissal of the lives of the people who died in the WTC,
unless I go beyond allowing my commitment to be questioned
and problematized and just chuck it.

Both the previous two paragraphs, though, still describe
things as if vulnerability and commitment (or standing up
for yourself, or for what you care about) were opposites,
and that's something I'd like to consider as a problem to
be worked on, a separate question from that of when to be
flexible and when to be rigid.

Vulnerability as a way of being, rather than a tactical
move, perhaps... and what would that mean?...

all the best,

Andy

P.S. I'll have to read that Cummings.

Andy wrote: For one thing, "vulnerability," leaving oneself
open to error and to multiple possible solutions (and to
more interesting problems than the ones we're handed--and,
because of all this, to attack), seems to me to be an
essential ethical concept at this time, when we've suffered
through almost five years of a relentless emphasis on
"security." Support for the all-out "war on terror" has been
(especially since 9/11) based largely on an insistence on
the right to a total safety; do I need to point out that
this safety is factually impossible? That nothing whatsoever
can ensure an absolute safety on any scale? In the face of
this, the demand for invulnerability amounts to a
sociopathic paranoia.


Substitute "security" for "invulnerability" and you have the
content of one of ee cummings' _Six Nonlectures_. And it's
easy to agree with much of what Andy writes.

However, look at the movement in the passage above. When
Andy connects poetry to politics, when he expands
Sonnenberg's comments about vulnerability in political poems
to politics itself, his prose immediately becomes dead
certain, almost alarmist.

See how the passage moves? No longer are we "vulnerable" to
"possible solutions." Instead, we are facing "sociopathic
paranoia."

This is NOT to demean the merits of Andy's argument; rather
I want to underscore how the movement toward political
speech is a movement toward sure answers and certitude. The
passage does not offer any vulnerability to possible
justifications for the demand for security. Instead we have
the certain knowledge that we are living through a social
"insistence on the right to a total safety."

That may or may not be. The point is the way language
changes in the political--from the meditative to the
rallying cry.


Best to all,
Eric Yost

Jason,
Agreed that a lot of poets these days don't seem to be
willing to think about, let's say, audiences.
But "immediacy"? Works we call "entertaining" tend to
be all but immediate, because they rely on
"commonplaces," formulas, conventions, eg Hollywood,
Spielberg....
Conversely, many "avant-guard" poets of the last
century have claimed "immediacy" as a central
principle of their work. Cf for instance Tristan Tzara
-- deemed (incorrectly for the most part, in my
opinion) "incomprehensible" sometimes by the poet
himself.
Also, you talk about "entertainment", and then proceed
to describe one of the effects people attribute to
"high art": Fascination. I wonder if the terms of the
problem aren't posed imperfectly here.
That said, yes, the High Art and Poetry of Genius that
I enjoy happens to Entertain me also.
Yours,
Alex

Marjorie Perloff asserts the compliment, that Postry
ought to be
written only
as a form of philosophy, in Wittgenstein's ladder
saying it follows
from the
first, which it doesn't, but oh well, if you go
through life expecting
valid
moves of logic from critics, you're going to be very
disappointed.

I'm bringing this up because i think there's a
tendency for people to
want to
connect poetry to something "deeper" and casting about
for that
"something
deep" they light naturally on philosophy because
philosophy is
confusing and
weird and decorated with all sorts of erudition
besides, and if you
don't
understand it but intelligent people seem to, then it
must be deep,
right?
except that's a trap that could lead one to assert
that star trek the
next
generation is deep. It is not, nor is philosophy.

What's my point? Poetry is entertainment. That's all
it's ever been.
It's a way
of holding the attention of an audience in order to
communicate
something.
That's my biggest beef with language poetry and a lot
of the composite
sleight
of hand stuff that is going on in the neo-concrete
poetry/digital
poetry/conceptual poetry/vispo people in the wake of
the american tree.
For
some reason it's become acceptable in the pursuit of
poetry as
political
statement or piece of high art to ignore it's function
as entertainment
and in
the process completely disregard immediacy as a
measure of quality.
Granted,
immediacy can be construed as a function of literacy,
but only up to a
point.

Once one has moved beyond the general familiarity with
a canon and a
tradition
that is to be expected of someone engaged in a
literature, the criteria
of
immediacy returns and only so much obliqueness and
"openness" to a text
can be
tolerated before one has to say that it is boring and
stupid. There is
a lot of
boring, stupid work in the world, and I think a
general disdain for a
certain
amount of immediacy is the result. At some point early
in the twentieth
century, and I think Ezra Pound is largely to be
blamed for this in
poetry--although it is certainly not limited to that,
a contrapopular
"high
art" meta-aesthetic was instituted that, whatever else
was going on in
various
movements, can be traced over the course of the
development of various
american
arts. When I say meta-aesthetic, I'm referring to what
is obvious in
the work
of the rank and file priests, monks, and nuns, and not
the stated aims
of the
bishops and cardinals following from the likes of
Pound, Picasso, and
Schoenberg.

I think that a large percentage of work that is trying
to be
adventurous has
chosen obscurantism and obfuscation in place of
immediacy as a means of
concealing the work's essentially anemic semantics. It
has been allowed
to do
so largely because to the uninitiated, work that is
adventurous is
often
indistinguishable from work that is incomprehensible.
I think this is
the sort
of problem that leads lesser light like Kenneth
Goldsmith to say things
like
"The 20th century avant-garde liked to embrace boredom
as a way of
getting
around what it considered to be the vapid "excitement"
of popular
culture."
Nonsense. The twentieth century avant-garde is full of
exciting work,
not the
least of which most of the output of Goldsmith's "king
of boredom"
Jackson Mac
Low. people who think that all there is to adventurous
work is to strip
the
work of the immediacy (the immediacy that is present
in unadventurous
work
through it's cliche nature) are missing the boat
completely. To be
disoriented
by a work and to have to figure out how to address it,
is not to say
that the
work shouldn't try to compel it's viewer or reader to
try to address
it. That's
one of the chief functions of the size of abstract
expressionist
paintings, to
pick an oft misunderstood example. A rothko, were it
the size of a
postage
stamp, would suck because it could easily be ignored.
But rothko's
enormous
canvases demand attention, as do Mac Low's "twenties"
poems to give an
example
from poetry, works i return to constantly not because
they are obscure
or
because i expect to find something deep there, but
because i still
don't know
quite how to describe how they make me feel. I don't
know how they do
it, but
they draw me back and demand that I deal with them on
some level. I
think part
of it has to do with the fact that one is forced to
read aloud
repeating
phrases over and over again trying to get the silences
timed right. But
it's
such a cunning trick on Mac Low's part to force the
reader into that.
It gives
a work that might otherwise be meaningless,
pretentious, and
obfuscating it's
own boringness, an immediacy that isn't, ironically,
immediately
apparent.

I'm not sure what i'm talking about anymore or how it
relates to the
thread so
I'm gonna shut up now.

 i know i’m nitpicking or at least playing  out of bounds on this one but

“i want to underscore how the movement toward political

  frankly this statement is the exact opposite of all my poems, I write to get out of this kind of thinking i don’t know what you others are doing but. …

  these are argument best left to the hired class (which this list seems to be largely made up of)

write a great political poem that is still blasting 100 years later and I bet there is very little “journalism”  in that poem which unfortunately  is the style that most political poems take as good  buddy calls it – “your reading pamphlets”- bad poem bad poet

open to error and to multiple possible solutions (and to
more interesting problems than the ones we're handed--and,
because of all this, to attack), seems to me to be an
essential ethical concept at this time, when we've suffered
through almost five years of a relentless emphasis on
"security." Support for the all-out "war on terror" has been
(especially since 9/11) based largely on an insistence on
the right to a total safety; do I need to point out that
this safety is factually impossible? That nothing whatsoever
can ensure an absolute safety on any scale? In the face of
this, the demand for invulnerability amounts to a
sociopathic paranoia.


Substitute "security" for "invulnerability" and you have the
content of one of ee cummings' _Six Nonlectures_. And it's
easy to agree with much of what Andy writes.

However, look at the movement in the passage above. When
Andy connects poetry to politics, when he expands
Sonnenberg's comments about vulnerability in political poems
to politics itself, his prose immediately becomes dead
certain, almost alarmist.

See how the passage moves? No longer are we "vulnerable" to
"possible solutions." Instead, we are facing "sociopathic
paranoia."

This is NOT to demean the merits of Andy's argument; rather
I want to underscore how the movement toward political
speech is a movement toward sure answers and certitude. The
passage does not offer any vulnerability to possible
justifications for the demand for security. Instead we have
the certain knowledge that we are living through a social
"insistence on the right to a total safety."

That may or may not be. The point is the way language
changes in the political--from the meditative to the
rallying cry.

I mentioned this thread to a friend who knows much more about Welsh poetry
than I do, and pass on, with her permission, some remarks she made in two
emails.

R.

********

Gwyneth Lewis has published poems in Welsh and in English -- they are not
translations of each other as she
says she writes different poems in each language. (Not all Welsh poets do
this -- most write in one or the other language, and Menna Elfyn translates
her own and publishes them in bilingual editions.) Lewis publishes alternate
books in Welsh and English. She has 3 English collections to date: 'Parables
and Faxes', 'Zero Gravity', and 'Keeping Mum', which last is a detective
story in verse about the 'murder' of the Welsh language -- a bit tongue in
cheek but serious too. 'Zero Gravity' is marvellous. There's also a
Collected Poems, but I never really trust them to have it all. She's written
prose as well, not critical but 'diary' sort of things about her battle with
depression, and I haven't read any of that apart from snippets quoted in
reviews etc, though I believe it's often surprisingly funny.

Sheenagh Pugh can hold her own with the best of them. She's a poet who
happens to be Welsh, rather than one who takes a stand on her Welshness. I
rate her very highly. And if you want an up-and-coming young Welsh poet,
Owen Sheers is the one. Mind you, he's just too beautiful to be true; but
he's a good poet and going to be better. Seren publish both him and Pugh,
and Lewis is with Bloodaxe. And [Robert] Minhinnick is Carcanet of course --
I have 'After the Hurricane', which I really must do more than dip into, and
soon!

Lewis is doing some interesting things with what seem to me to be ideas of
duality, in addition to the duality of language she's engaging in.
Minhinnick seems to me to be the one who's most obviously interesting in
terms of form.

*******

[Further to the mention of Robert Minhinnick above:]

This bit copied from Carcanet's online catalogue.

<<  The Adulterer's Tongue casts a brilliant light on the world of
Welsh-language poetry. Poetry has been written in Welsh for over fifteen
hundred years: an ancient literature, it is also a vibrant part of the
culture of modern Europe, often overlooked by English speakers. Robert
Minhinnick's translations bring six outstanding contemporary Welsh language
poets into the spotlight, providing the Welsh texts en face. Minhinnick,
himself a leading poet, is conscious of the responsibilities of translating
out of a minority language. His versions take risks, but honour the
originals' forms and intentions, making audible a wide array of individual
styles and voices. The poets here each in different ways remake the language
and culture they inherit. This collection testifies to the abiding creative
energy of the Welsh language and culture. The poets are: Bobi Jones, Menna
Elfyn, Emyr Lewis, Iwan Llwyd, Gwyneth Lewis and Elin ap Hywel.  >>


I should mention the Academi, the official Welsh literature promotional
agency which does things like running the Cardiff International Poetry
competition (valuable and prestigious -- I'd love even to be placed!), and
is also a sort of higher echelon of writers -- you get invited to join this
rather than buying in. If anybody is actually wondering about Welsh-language
avant-gard, then I am not the one to ask, and it might be best to contact
the Academi direct and ask them. (Try their website). I could maybe ask
Annie's 22-year-old niece, who grew up bilingual, graduated in English with
a creative writing option, and now writes in both Welsh and English; she
might know if such a thing at the very least exists. Though I'd have thought
they'd have quite enough on their plates without L=A=N=G=P=O in Welsh!

The (Anglo-)Welsh literary publishing house is Seren, which is I believe
Welsh for star. The quarterly mag Poetry Wales, presently edited by
Minhinnick, is it seems also run by them, which I hadn't realised. There was
something called The Anglo-Welsh Review, which I understand is now defunct
and replaced by The New Anglo-Welsh Review. May be doing it an injustice but
it doesn't sound terribly interesting, to me -- a bit staid. Might be wrong!
Haven't been able to hunt down any Welsh-language poetry mags. They must
exist, surely; but not so easy to find their websites if you don't read
Welsh more than about 15 words. But anyway, it'd be the Welsh poets writing
in English that would be of interest to Jason [Quackenbush]. And with them,
the really interesting aspect is the vitality their work gains from the
cross-fertilisation of cultures. And it's obviously way past time that I
knew more about that myself too, in practical terms. Not speaking Welsh, but
having in my ear the familial matrix from which my English grew.

I believe Wilhelm Reich (not that he is the last word) wrote that art is
made not from within the box or outside of the box but in getting out of
the
box. Of course there are all kinds of poetry in all countries, each w/
its
own greatness.

Bradley, nice answer. A lot of people like this answer because it's so, lik=
e, autonomous - not reactionary at all.

Experimental might be like self-help, didactic?

Bradley: whoop whoop!

as far as immediacy goes, and i'm working this out on the fly because it's something i've just been thinking about recently, i think the field bears a distinction between immediacy in composition, which is certainly true of the dadaists and surrealists, and immediacy in fascination--i really like that term for what i want to say all works should strive towards. I think where a lot of the poetry envelope pushers of the last century went wrong was in establishing too high a threshhold for the fascination to trigger. That is, rather than going out and trying to attract an audience, there has been--in a lot of cases, although certainly not all--an expectation for the reader to come to the poet rather than the poet coming to the reader. Now, i'm certainly not advocating a crass commercialism or some sort of Ted Kooserish populism. I just think that it's a little bit odd that so many American poets don't feel compelled to try to be as interesting as possible.

As an example, my mother is an intelligent woman with a post graduate education who is highly literate and enjoys reading. She is not, however, a specialist in poetry. From time to time, I leave books at my parents house and she flips through them, and I take her reactions to be illuminating. Of Russell Edson's _The Tunnel_: "some of these are really funny. he doesn't like women, does he?" Of the Collected Ted Berrigan: "Some of these are really good when he's talking about his friends and family." and of Hejinian's _My Life_: "I can't make heads or tales of this. blech."

I guess what i'm trying to say is that I think, since the ascendance of Pound and Williams, and particularly since Language poetry, there's been a movement away from engaging the reader, trying to fascinate a reader, in the direction of a stentorian demand that the reader work to understand the poet. I'm not 100% sure i understand what people like Prof Watten are talking about when they're talking about open texts and the democratization of poetry and what not, but I think it's telling that what's essentially liberal in theory becomes authoritarian in practice, demanding that the reader work to engage the poet rather than the poet engage the reader, all in return for some reward to come should the reader do so. Of course the analogy to stalinism breaks down at the point that the reader actually engages with a text, but still, I think it's worth examining. Particularly since those anti-reader
tendencies have become even more exaggerated in the work of certain recent digital and visual poetries. I'm not saying it's wrong to place high demands on the reader. I like a lot of poetry that does. What I'm trying to get at is the unexplored landscape of fascination, of trying to fascinate while at the same time avoiding the stock tropes and cliche moves that are familiar from hollywood and television. Interestingly, I think a lot of that can come from things that poetics have traditionally ignored. One of the things that makes HBO's "Deadwood" so fascinating, for example, is it's setting, which, I think, every aesthetician since Aristotle has downplayed as one of the least important factors in a work.

Thanks for this response Andrew. I'm still working through the thoughts you've cause me to think. But I feel some certain growth, or at least, some clarity in my means of articulating my ideas as a result of this email; I really appreciate it.

yrs,
JFQ

I like that last statement, Jason...=20

though I don't find most Language poetry as forbidding or unentertaining =
as you paint it (sorry langpo folks who are trying to cast an insoluble =
stone into the brain's absorptive cistern)...=20

the stuff that resonates does so because of some quality inherent in the =
writing -- and something pre -pared/-determined/-assigned in the =
reader's head, I would say -- whether or not it "means" anything or can =
be digested poetically.=20

cf. Nietzsche contra Wagner : the way I remember it, the philosopher's =

operas were too fascinating, too easy to become mesmerized by... they =
are in this sense the ultimate absorptive cultural product. an art made =

fascinating - immediate - artistic - even poetic ?=20

and go tell Lucretius and Empedocles (et alia) that poetry can't be=20

Jason,
Agreed that a lot of poets these days don't seem to be
willing to think about, let's say, audiences.
But "immediacy"? Works we call "entertaining" tend to
be all but immediate, because they rely on
"commonplaces," formulas, conventions, eg Hollywood,
Spielberg....
Conversely, many "avant-guard" poets of the last
century have claimed "immediacy" as a central
principle of their work. Cf for instance Tristan Tzara
-- deemed (incorrectly for the most part, in my
opinion) "incomprehensible" sometimes by the poet
himself.
Also, you talk about "entertainment", and then proceed
to describe one of the effects people attribute to
"high art": Fascination. I wonder if the terms of the
problem aren't posed imperfectly here.
That said, yes, the High Art and Poetry of Genius that
I enjoy happens to Entertain me also.
Yours,
Alex

Andy: Vulnerability as a way of being, rather than a
tactical move, perhaps... and what would that mean?...

Hmmmm. In part, an ability to transcend one's politics,
rethink them or suspend them--for what is "commitment" but a
series of beliefs one is unwilling to question? The
unwillingness to question basic political assumptions--even
to recognize that one operates from such
assumptions--usually means that political discussions end in
shouting matches and name calling.

Some people think politics is an extension of their personal
morality. For them, political arguments are essentially
moral ones. Others think politics is an amoral game of
geopolitical advantage, and answer moral objections with
practical ones designed to maximize advantage for the group
with which they identify.

For example:

	"Gitmo is wrong. It shows an evil side of our country."
	"But Gitmo works. It enables us to interrogate suspects
without their being all lawyered up."
	"Innocent people are in Gitmo. They suffer."
	"The twentieth hijacker is also in Gitmo. Should we let him
take the Fifth Amendment?"
	"We have certain standards to live up to."
	"We are also at war and should play to win."


Both sides talk past each other. You can't answer a moral
argument with a practical objection. You also can't answer a
practical argument with a moral objection. If you do, you
engage two arguments rather than one.

So--disregarding the broader sense of politics--maybe the
first part of "vulnerability" is examining the grounds of
commitment. (I remember listening to anarchists in Tompkins
Square Park in the '90s arguing over what the Anarchist Flag
should be.)

Think of Pushkin. He was a firebrand political poet who
moderated over time. The Tsar took it on himself to be
Pushkin's editor and censor, thus preventing Pushkin from
dying in the Decembrist Revolt--perhaps because he
recognized that Pushkin's poetry was more important the
ephemeral politics.

Or think of the little menage WH Auden set up in Brooklyn,
where he banned discussions of politics and religion at
table. The unspoken might be another form of vulnerability.


Best,
Eric

I've been disturbed, in this conversation by the way the term "politics" is
being used,

how discussion moved very quickly past politics' identification (and not)
with "religion," which is one of the major geopolitical issues of the day,
and our country historically,

[Eric's last started to touch on this -- religion is not philosophy]

and the reduction of the "immigration mess" from: conservative - not quite
neo fascist as in Europe - opposition to immigration / liberal
coalition-style opposition to globalism / liberal support of illegal
immigration / conservative support of a permanent servant class to: "fight
the power,"

and the ways in which this is being nicely knotted with a performance /
entertainment / "natural" poetry versus an elitist / language / "cultural"
poetry dichotomy

w/o any consideration of the extremely political aspects of the poetry most
people on this list write and publish

All best,
Catherine Daly

back to Hollywood, and my factory school ms draft about liberte egalite
fraternite vs. travail familie patrie; at least Steve Martin wrote (he has
rewrite credit),  "Paris" (quoted on IMDB as "politics") "where greed wears

It strikes me as odd to say that since modernism the idea has been that readers
should work hard to understand the poet.  When I'm reading poetry, it's the
poetry I'm working with and understanding.  If I read more of a particular
artist's work, I may try to understand the poet as well, by many of the same
means -- but that's not, for me, what is at issue in the reading of any given
poem.

But, more crucially in my view, people are all too quick to make assumptions
about what sorts of linguistic acts require more or less work on the part of
readers and listeners.  For one quick example, given the frequency with which I
encounter people who believe that Frost's poem means that good fences do make
good neighbors, understanding even the seemingly most straightforward poetry
may be more complex than we'd think at first blush.

Dan,

Those programs don't necessarily "teach" experimental techniques, they
just -- as Maria said -- favor avant tendancies more than other

I think you misunderstand me. Writing poetry is an act of communication. It's a language-game, to understand the poem, you are understanding what the poet has said. Full stop.

As for robert frost's fences, well, it's precisely the sort of thing i'm talking about. Frost and his ilk are the most boring poetry's ecclesiastics, and they believe more strongly than any of the avant garde poets of the 20th century that the reader must come to the poet as though approaching the mysteries of orpheus. One of the reasons I like the avant gardists that I like is because there's a lot more pizzazz to what they do, their work is much more interesting. Take, for example, one of my favorite poems, Silliman's "Chinese Notebook." Part of what draws the reader's eye is the strangeness of the form, the disjunctiveness of the sentences. From there, there's some difficulty, yes, but that's the good kind of difficulty, the kind of work that you want to do because you've already been dazzled. compare that to, say, Jorie Graham's Orpheus and Eurydice and I think you can see the ecclesiastic vs. ecstatic disctinction that i'm trying to draw.

ecclesiastic poetry vs. ecstatic poetry. I'm going to have to think on that one, but i think it's close to what i'm talking about with immediacy and it's occasional lack. I like it in particular because it cuts across the traditional insider/outsider division in american poetry. some days i wish it was still fashionable to write dozens of manifestoes as an unknown writer.

I've taken "poetry" out of the subject heading, since we
seem to have drifted away.

Eric,

Though your comments are well-intentioned, and address
problems that I also see as problems, they place the
discussion of vulnerability in exactly the sphere in
which, it seems to me, nothing new can come of it.

1) The dialogue you include in your post is one I don't
want to be involved in. For one thing--as you point
out--it's unlikely to get anywhere in the form it has
here. Add some kind of "openness" to it, and you're
looking at one of two failures: either the conversation
will consist of each person mutually giving ground on
his or her assertions, leading to a compromise that's
unlikely to offer any solutions to the most crucial and
difficult problems motivating the conversation in the
first place; or one person will make repeated concessions
in an attempt to appear undogmatic--concessions meant
to be taken as generous "openings"--and the other will
take advantage of them ruthlessly (this happens all over
the place; a particularly insidious version can be seen
on talk shows, where the guest must play the host's game
if the former is to get anything said, and where that
game ensures that what is said will only be seen on the
host's terms). Only tactical vulnerabilities seem available.

I think it's crucial to distinguish what's at stake. For me
it's not primarily a matter of my deepest principles, but
of what I want to happen (in the examples so far, this is
the cessation of large-scale violence). If the person I'm
arguing with is motivated by the desire to be right (rather
than by a desire for a problem to be solved), then we're
not related to the same project at all, and there's no
point in having the conversation. The insistence on
rightness is one definite opposite to the cultivation of
vulnerability.

If that person is motivated by the desire for a different
overall situation, then we might be getting somewhere. Say
they also want the violence to stop, but their principles
only require that they care about U.S. citizens. Though
our principles may be incommensurable, our desires overlap.
I also want U.S. citizens to be free of that. The openness
then comes in when we've put the "for what" temporarily
aside and begin to focus on the "how;" at this point, the
willingness to make imperfect and tentative suggestions,
knowing that the other can call them into question,
becomes important. In any case, vulnerability would
absolutely have to include giving up a primary concern
for whether one comes out on top or not, in the argument
and its results.

2) There's a difference between being firm about something
and "having all the answers," or wanting to appear that
way. I think there's a value to negation; to say "not war"
is not to say, "I know exactly what should be done instead."
Here one makes oneself vulnerable to the tired statement,
"If you don't have a fully-articulated alternative, shut
up." This is crap. For one thing, uncertainty seems far
better than all-out war. For another thing, the ability
to try out new solutions (for example, ensuring that everyone's
basic needs are met) is often prevented by the currently
operative "solution" (ex. military spending and corporate
development divert resources and freeze economic possibilities).

3) The point is not to broaden everything so that everyone
agrees. Turning an argument into something we can all agree
on, erasing differences, is nothing new, and produces nothing
new.

4) One of many things that are "the point" might be to
distinguish, in practice, authority from authoritarianism.
If I've thought a lot about something, studied it, committed
myself to it, then why, in an argument, should I downplay
that perfectly legitimate authority? As long as I don't use
it to create power differentials (as a tool to win the
argument), it shouldn't become authoritarian. Of course,
it's not so simple; there are power dynamics that neither
I nor my interlocutor put into action, and they will affect
how my (or their) authority operates. "Vulnerabilism" as
a way of being might involve figuring out how to defuse
those--WITHOUT sacrificing knowledge and dedication to
an ideology of agreement. The problem with privilege of
any kind doesn't lie in its benefits--which shouldn't
be jettisoned--but in the denial of its benefits to others,
the consequences of it being privilege and not resource.

5) Most of this refers to the interpersonal sphere. It's
becoming clear that "vulnerability" will probably mean
something different when it comes to government-level
politics, where it seems like interpersonal status (looking
good, winning the argument) is a less powerful motivating
force, since government officials have a more direct
relationship to large-scale power investments (both in
terms of their financial connections to power structures
and their ability to affect them) than we do.

6) And then there's poetry. What vulnerability might mean
in political poetry has barely begun to be parsed out.

all the best,

Andy

FOOTNOTE: Also--to get back into direct statement--I would
never have the conversation you describe because everything
that's said in it is absurd. I would never say "it shows an
evil side of our country." Indeed, the moralistic tone is
impotent in the face of the equally vapid, "we're at war
and should play to win." This is a conversation between two
idiots. How about: "There's no evidence whatsoever that
torture has ever worked to "extract" accurate information,
and everything about it makes it unlikely that it will?"

------------------------------

Eric wrote:

Andy: Vulnerability as a way of being, rather than a
tactical move, perhaps... and what would that mean?...

Hmmmm. In part, an ability to transcend one's politics,
rethink them or suspend them--for what is "commitment" but a
series of beliefs one is unwilling to question? The
unwillingness to question basic political assumptions--even
to recognize that one operates from such
assumptions--usually means that political discussions end in
shouting matches and name calling.

Some people think politics is an extension of their personal
morality. For them, political arguments are essentially
moral ones. Others think politics is an amoral game of
geopolitical advantage, and answer moral objections with
practical ones designed to maximize advantage for the group
with which they identify.

For example:

 "Gitmo is wrong. It shows an evil side of our country."
 "But Gitmo works. It enables us to interrogate suspects
without their being all lawyered up."
 "Innocent people are in Gitmo. They suffer."
 "The twentieth hijacker is also in Gitmo. Should we let him
take the Fifth Amendment?"
 "We have certain standards to live up to."
 "We are also at war and should play to win."


Both sides talk past each other. You can't answer a moral
argument with a practical objection. You also can't answer a
practical argument with a moral objection. If you do, you
engage two arguments rather than one.

So--disregarding the broader sense of politics--maybe the
first part of "vulnerability" is examining the grounds of
commitment. (I remember listening to anarchists in Tompkins
Square Park in the '90s arguing over what the Anarchist Flag
should be.)

Think of Pushkin. He was a firebrand political poet who
moderated over time. The Tsar took it on himself to be
Pushkin's editor and censor, thus preventing Pushkin from
dying in the Decembrist Revolt--perhaps because he
recognized that Pushkin's poetry was more important the
ephemeral politics.

Or think of the little menage WH Auden set up in Brooklyn,
where he banned discussions of politics and religion at
table. The unspoken might be another form of vulnerability.


Best,
Eric

Advanced in age--ah, for some of us, yes, unfortunately.

Seriously, though, we're doing our best to weed out the poetasters. That's
all. Many are appreciative, thankfully, for we're most certainly not doing
it for the money.

Andy: How about: "There's no evidence whatsoever that
torture has ever worked to "extract" accurate information,
and everything about it makes it unlikely that it will?"


Eric: Well, if ask that, you are playing the pragmatist's
game for them. A pragmatist--as opposed to someone whose
politics is built on their personal morality--can supply
examples where torture has indeed "worked" to secure
intelligence. Case in point is Khalid Sheik Mohammed,
captured in Pakistan and sent into rendition. Information
extracted by waterboarding KSM has indeed been crucial to
rolling up many al-Qaeda cells.

I could document this if you want, but it would be beside
the nonpartisan point I am trying to make; namely that the
unexamined part of our convictions is what prevents dialogue
in politics.

If somebody dresses up a moral judgment as a practical
judgment in debate, and someone else refutes it, the moral
arguer doesn't respond to the refutation as she would if
someone refuted her erroneous idea of, for example, the
rhyme scheme of a ghazal. We don't learn from the argument
because what is being refuted is our morality, not our
practical knowledge.

Suppose you are presented with information establishing that
torture does indeed work in many cases. Would that change
your view? Or would you just shift ground and find another
avenue for refuting the war on terror?

As Roethke famously wrote, "we think by feeling / what is
there to know?" Most people abhor the notion of torture on
moral grounds and wouldn't be satisfied with knowing that it
often works, or what the CIA's approved torture tactics are.
It wouldn't matter. It's a moral reaction not a pragmatic one.

That's why it's important to know whether people are making
moral arguments or pragmatic arguments. You can't defeat a
moral argument; it's grounded in a person's morality and
overrules any pragmatic consideration. But people will often
present their moral arguments as though they were pragmatic
arguments. That's where the shouting matches start.

Vulnerability, then, would be admitting at the outset, among
other things, whether one's political judgments are guided
by morality or by a desire to see one's group triumph, or by
some specific admixture of the two. This is the center from
which we write poetry, isn't it?

(Vulnerability is also my windbagging through this long
post, which could just as easily start a flame as stimulate
a discussion. Understand I'm not writing to argue the terror
war but rather to discuss how the terror war is argued.)

Best,
Eric

add Miami University (Oxford, Ohio) to these lists. Evidence for this may be
found at Meshworks (see link below), where there's loads of video
documentation of student/professor collaborations (and sound too if you
can't stand the site of it). Particularly, see the videos of SCENE !N HERD
and post_moot, the former being a performance series organized by students
of the local avant scene (necessarily apres l'avant), and the latter being a
festival put on collaboratively by students and professors but bringing in a
veritable host of significant others to help reach those really tough spots
that no one can ever seem to get to alone. Scratch.

I believe Wilhelm Reich (not that he is the last word) wrote that art is
made not from within the box or outside of the box but in getting out of
the
box. Of course there are all kinds of poetry in all countries, each w/
its
own greatness.

Eric,

Well, you're really only addressing the off-the-top-of-
my-head footnote to my last post... and thus still limiting
the scope of what vulnerability might mean to an area other
than those I particularly want to focus on... but I do
think you're right to say that one can't argue with morals,
and certainly owning up to one's motivations is desirable.
On the other hand, I don't think the field is exhausted by
the alternatives you present ("guided by morality" and "by
a desire to see one's group triumph"). There are a lot of
other possibilities (one being the desire to save face/win,
another being the belief that the consequences of one's
desires will be good for almost everyone, including the
people you thoroughly disagree with, others being...).

I do think that discourse can change desires, and that art
can do this, too, particularly by offering new and
unheard-of desires ("what would it be like to want this?").
I've certainly had the experience of encountering new desires
through art (from sociopolitical possibilities to the
fragility of odd and quiet aesthetic constructions), desires
that became motivating, at which point I realized that they
brought into question some of the desires I'd had... and,
since those desires were often based on ethical principles,
those ethical principles also changed. I'm trying to say
that there are indirect routes to morals that can sometimes
make change happen where going toe-to-toe in an argument
can't. And they happen in other places than art, as when
new social possibilities are actualized, and the value systems
of some people are shaken in the face of them.

And it's true that there's an opening-oneself-up in having
this discussion... but you won't get a flame war from me;
I've foresworn such stuff, and don't have the time... and
anyway, thinking through this stuff under scrutiny is good.

cheers,

Andy

sure read the books - i think i said read a lot of books (all sorts of books) poetry books pamphlets, street signs, the clouds everything


i'm not anti education - i just don't trust "institutional experimental poetry"

 sorry but it tends to leave a bad stain on the page

or maybe there really are an infinity of universes, as some physicists
think- and maybe there are 13 dimensions but only 3 plus time that we can
perceive, & maybe universes die & others come into existence--all recent
speculation
& maybe god doesn't think

Ah well ya finly gt my attn w/ this thread
               because of the "new improved" subject heading!

have way too many thoughts about it for this forum, but Daniel's =20
point is refreshing after all the advertisements
(and, yes, many of these advertisements do come from people I =20
respect, and/or love, and/or consider friends,
or work at schools at which I have played the institutional role of =20
'student' and even 'teacher'
or edit magazines of which I have played the institutional role of =20
"contributor"

but anyhoo--i don't think there's necessarily some big either/or =20
about it...
as a 'student' i was probably way more like daniel
and as a 'teacher' i think i was always on the look at for 'students' =20=

like daniel
(sometimes I had to poke around and dig beneath layers of 'training' =20
to find them--
but they're there....
and sometimes the institutional bosses will tout freedom
but still (secretly?) fear one is 'selling away the store'
if one, however gently, tries to replace the role of 'authority figure'
(uh, Althusserian ideological hailing!!---oops, my 'training' lingo
is making a brief comeback----help! police!)
with a different attitute....

Like I had teachers who genuinely believed themselves to be speaking =20
for something less institutional
because when (and where) they were students, say, STEIN AND WILLIAMS =20
were considered outsiders
and scorned by THEIR teachers....and, as they fight that battle, they =20=

often don't see when they're older
how they are repeating the same thing for their students.....
and so on......ad infinitum....
but if ya can accept it as a game, and keep a distance,
and realize, well, it's just buying time, and getting a teaching =20
credential
(if you need a job, and are a fascinating conversationalist),
and maybe make some friends, and find a community
that encourages 'each to his needs, each to her abilities' etc....
well, any of these programs can be okay for awhile--
as can less 'experimental' writing programs.
And, though it didn't work for me, I bet there's some who can
eschew the loans or get a scholarship to work on their
writing while adjuncting at the local Burger King....

And secretly, tucked away in Virginia "Is For Lovers If You're
Straight," a plethora of not-100%-mainstream writers -- the infamous Rod
Smith; POM2 editors Susan Landers & Ethan Fugate; Jennifer Coleman,
Allison Cobb, Jules Boykoff, Kaia Sand, Betsy Andrews, Heather Fuller,
Jean Donnelly, CE Putnam, I could go on and on and on -- have sneaked
through or around George Mason's MFA program, and I can prove it.

That's what throws the monkey wrench into any discussion of MFA programs
and which ones are receptive to not-100%-mainstream writing. Not only do
the professors occasionally pack up and depart, but the *student*
population shifts -- and the value of the right conga line of student
bodies cannot be underestimated. If you are lucky enough to be in the
middle of a creative ferment involving people who are as passionately
obsessive as you are about the same types of issues, that kicks things
up a notch for everyone. But you can't *guarantee* a surrounding
creative gestalt (of whatever kind -- experimental, throwback-New
Critical, whatever) in any given program; you can only guess, and pay
your money. I think that's a flaw inherent in the entire MFA system.

Or, speaking of Frost, think of the number of people
who read "The Road Not Taken" as a positive, uplifting
poem about doing your own thing. It's as if that
"sigh" and the whole of the second stanza don't exist
for most readers (particular those who use it at
graduation ceremonies).

Best,
Joseph

Andy: ...still limiting the scope of what vulnerability
might mean to an area other than those I particularly want
to focus on...


Here's a notion. People spend a lot more time defending
their symbolic idea of themselves than they spend defending
their actual persons.

Examples of a symbolic idea of self include, "I'm the kind
of person who..." or "I'm not the kind of person who..."

This becomes "I'm the kind of poet who" does/doesn't write
in forms, revise, champion the oppressed in my poems, oppose
the Bush administration, give readings, etc.

Vulnerability is, in part, refusing to be satisfied with a
limiting symbolic self, poetic or otherwise.

Can anyone recommend online (or print) indexes for poetry published in
journals? What the libraries near me subscribe to keeps changing (generally
by cutting what's available), and I haven't searched in a while -- so, can't
remember what's good for such a search...

Hello, I'm Jesse, editor at listenlight.net.   The upcoming issue 02
will be strong, tho presently it lacks work by women.  And so, first,
women in kind & urgency are invited to send work for issue 02, to give
this small journal a shove to gather its own momentum. Next, a call for
a range of audio and visual content: visual poetry, graphic art,
recorded readings, and photography.  thank you and all best --jwc

Dear Friends of Palm Press,

It's been a busy summer at Palm Press and there are many things to be =
excited about, especially the recent participation of several people in =
the evolving project of the press as new authors, designers, and =
editorial collaborators. Palm will release 6 new books this fall =
including 5 chapbooks (one with audio CD) and our second perfectbound =
book; we're making plans to convene another session of the conference =
Small Press Culture Workers as a site-specific event in the desert next =
spring; we're working on the project of uploading several Palm =
chapbooks, reviews of titles, audio files of our writers and video files =
of what we do here in Long Beach and beyond. We also have plans to =
manifest some of the ideas investigated in Mark Nowak's essay =
"Neoliberalism, Collective Action and the American MFA Industry" from =
his 2005 Palm Press chapbook, Workers of the Word, Unite and Fight!, as =
a community-based peer-to-peer literacy exchange teaching and learning =
network, The Hedge School.

But for now, we are very excited about our new website which has just =
gone live today. So we figured we'd better tell you about it!

Palm Press' new website was designed by LA-based writer Allison Carter. =
Check it out at www.palmpress.org and stay tuned for more information...

We hope that this finds you well, writing, reading and enjoying the last =
few weeks of summer.=20

On behalf of Palm Press,

Jane Sprague, Editor

In promoting one's work, how should blurbs be used? Is
it inappropriate to include a blurb in one's bio, for
example?

i replied to a question but it seems it didn't get back to the list,
which is good, i rarely get my words altogether right the first time..

"the work i'm committed to right now has a range that could blend well
with most styles; while imaginative and complex, the average tone
doesn't make terribly difficult inversions"

who knows.. with the right music you could weep.

Dear Harriet,

I love your poem.  thanks.

here's a scenario
what do you all think
inline journal accepts my pome
nice enough to question possibly typos
smart enough to ask if they were intentional or not
then i make corrections
then he says i'm in
then he sends a 2 page contract

i give up all rights to the poem for at least one year after which if i
take poem back
it will not be included in a possible anthology
as opposed to whether i let him keep it indefinitely
he is notpaying me but wants exclusivity
here's a kicker point 10 of contract states
if i publish poem anywhere else in the world i have to pay editor 100$
(that'sof course if he found out HA)

point 12 stated that if i wanted to remove the pome from his site before
the year
was up i'd have to pay him 50 bucks and upon recepit of said $
he'd remove it after 30 days

the contract has  atotal of  17 points of which i must agree to sign and
return
in order to get pome published  what should i doo(d0) what
would you do?  poets being martyrs  should i agree to this?
actually after questioning him on that he got anoyed as did those i asked
why
we didn't share the door and told me he loved pome thought i wass well
esrablishe but rathe not work with me if this discussion ensues on the
list i will
paste in his responses to my queries...publisher ha right to publish it
anywhere get it translated etc  maybe to emasculate the auther as well

i'm a bit confused, just changed from html digest to regular, in order
to respond to individual postings; haven't learned how to do this.
little help?


about the statement \ quotation, i'm sure it seems generic.  i do want
to read difficult, nuanced inversions of tone, syntax, and meaning.  i

dear list here is one editors answer  deleted publication and his name

Steve,
I think you're a good poet, well-established, and respected, but I'm not
going to work with you through blank. You basically seem to expect me to
accept crap end of the deal, work at length for free and then pay you
somehow even if I earn a minor pittance years from now. I don't think you
understand publishing, how little money is actually profit, and how poets
are rarely paid for their work.

As for relinquishing the fee for retrieval of rights, I won't do it. I
have to have rights to the poem to publish it. If you commit the poem to
me, and then publish it elsewhere, your commitment to me means nothing.
That fee is my way of saying that I have it exclusively for at least a
year. Asking to have your cake and eat it too is asking too much from me.

I am withdrawing my acceptance of your poem, because you did not follow
my submission guidelines, you sent me a careless submission with typos in
it -- I showed you the respect of reading it anyway -- and now expect me
to go above any beyond to accommodate your wants. It even takes me a
while to read you e-mails since you don't use punctuation in anything you
write. I'm sure you'll do fine in the future, but I'm not interested in
working with you.

Good luck.
blank

it isn't like you either have this poem published in this venue or the poem
ceases to exist. you have a choice. if you are uncomfortable, don't do it.

the editor sounds like a two-timing jackass... that's my first reaction,
anyway... I've been in publishing for about 10 years and have never
heard such a petulant, excuse-laden response to an author, even if there
is a kernel of truth in it re: operational costs vs. potential returns
on product. you scare authors away if you cop this kind of attitude.=20

a follow-up question: how much could you change a poem to get it out of
the kind of contractual restrictions your editor wanted to lay on you? I
use the platform of my blog (http://anchovyorchestra.blogspot.com/) for
works in progress; i.e., I work through a lot of what I put up there
after it's been put up there.=20

is that considered playing dirty ball? should a work that's
published/posted be the final version? and if it's not final, then can
you get away with republishing with Y publisher an altered version of
the piece you've already submitted to X publisher? =20

the more I write the more immoral this sounds to me...

dear list here is one editors answer  deleted publication and his name

Steve,
I think you're a good poet, well-established, and respected, but I'm not
going to work with you through blank. You basically seem to expect me to
accept crap end of the deal, work at length for free and then pay you
somehow even if I earn a minor pittance years from now. I don't think
you
understand publishing, how little money is actually profit, and how
poets
are rarely paid for their work.=20

As for relinquishing the fee for retrieval of rights, I won't do it. I
have to have rights to the poem to publish it. If you commit the poem to
me, and then publish it elsewhere, your commitment to me means nothing.
That fee is my way of saying that I have it exclusively for at least a
year. Asking to have your cake and eat it too is asking too much from
me.

I am withdrawing my acceptance of your poem, because you did not follow
my submission guidelines, you sent me a careless submission with typos
in
it -- I showed you the respect of reading it anyway -- and now expect me
to go above any beyond to accommodate your wants. It even takes me a
while to read you e-mails since you don't use punctuation in anything
you
write. I'm sure you'll do fine in the future, but I'm not interested in
working with you.

Good luck.

 >>That's a good notion.

Here's another notion. Vulnerability consists in shifting
self-definition from the not-self to the open-ended self.

Put more simply, people often define themselves in part by
what they don't like. "I don't like Lowell, Schubert,
Rothko," etc.

Vulnerability involves expanding the things one loves, and
defining oneself by an ever-expanding ability to love new
things.

I've been thinking about this in a different way... Listening to Revel's Bolero:  It's kind of a facist tune.  I can imagine stormtroopers goosestepping through cities, even though Maurice said he imagined it as the growth of industry.

  This led me to think that, poetry (the writing and reading of it) is a kind of facism: we qualify one mode over another.  When writing, so much is left out.  When reading, so much is unappreciated and disregarded.

  Ashbery said it in his poem This Room, "Something shimmers, something is hushed up."  and "Why do I even tell you these things? / You are not even here."

  Granted poetry is a more phatic form of facism.  And facism, as we think of it, don's a war bonnet.  But even happiness is facist, guide dogs for the blind is a facist relationship.

  I don't think there is any easy way out or in; we have to have our preferences  determined by our biological necessity to survive.  "Judge not, lest ye be judged" is a load of crap.  We judge and are judged every second of the day.  Get over it.

  This issue of Vulnerabilty is important for poetry and poets.  All poetry, the good, bad and the ugly, has to be under an umbrella of poetry.  Whether it is one umbrella or multiple umbrellas is an individual thing.

  It's not even raining where I am.  I like it all; some of it sucks, some of it sucks less.  Some of us like some poetry but not other poetries.  I'm cool with that.  That's your deal.

  For me, this surfaces as a "yes and yes" world as opposed to the "yes and no" world in which I live.

  I'm thinking quantum poetics.

  The belief in an alleged God that this list seems to take for granted is a kind of facism.  i.e. My god is better than yours. or Your belief system sucks, mine is better.
  God exists, God doesn't exist.  Can I value both?  If human's fell in the forest, would God still exist?  Without us, who would care?  The next time God comes up in a conversation, I'm going to say, "Who?"

  The sheer act of expounding beliefs on this forum makes me feel like Mussolini.  Please do us all favor, take me out back and beat the shit out of me.  It's our only hope, it's my only hope.

  "Vulnerability involves expanding the things one loves, and defining oneself by an ever-expanding ability to love new things."

  Well said, Mr. Eric, to which I add, abandon the things you love.  Kill the buddha when you see him, he will only distract you.

i hear stormtroopers in the rite of spring moving into Paris decades ahead of when they did - time travel or just the fascism of  personal fascism that gets anything made how i write all these poems  i sit down and write them the goddesses help only if i tune them in mostly it's static or noise that cranks out a letter of maybe a word or two in a row

hi there, steve. hope you're well! coupla things:

1) i echo others on the list in saying that the editor you've posted about sounds horrible and absolutely out of line. from what i'm gathering, if your poem was posted with that journal you would get no money...but he'd get rights to it for a year, at least...and if you wanted to publish it elsewhere within that time, you would owe *him* money? why should anyone agree to that?!

2) i also agree with something you said in one of your notes to him--that email can sometimes seem to distort the writer's intention somehow. this has happened to me--that what i've written via email has been totally misconstrued, in tone or in fact, leaving me to wish i had not written at all.

3) so when you brought up concerns about an unfair situation, this editor's response was to criticize/belittle you and retract your acceptance. lovely! i think his/her message was, "my job is to make the rules; yours is to accept them, or else." since when is that acceptable behavior between adults?!

4) i, too, would welcome the name of this editor and this journal, so i can be sure to avoid. onward and upward for you!


all best, pam

Imaginal Landscapes

I can't believe I'm finally seeing all of these images together, =20
resonant families, communalities, Kristeva's chora-chorus! Wonderful! =20=

Such original work - these are master-mistress-pieces - their =20
philosophic tendencies ring true, readings and rereadings. I've =20
followed their development just as language murmurs, burbles - their =20
linguistic-paleontologies, infinite and indeterminate depths. Where =20
is the locus of these landscapes? Who are the inscribers? Who are the =20=

inscribed?

=97Alan Sondheim

I wondered how Ciccariello's swirling-colored imaginary would =20
translate into the de-rigueur black-and-white of the magnificent =20
Xerolage series; the results are vertiginously thrilling. Surfaces, =20
pliable and lapidary, inscribed with disoriented fragments of words =20
and alphabetic spasms, collide and interweave in a visual dance of =20
merging and emerging.

=97Maria Damon

Put on your Alice-in-Wonderland head and dive into these poems. Don't =20=

be surprised if you run into Ian Hamilton Finlay and M.C. Escher, =20
and, I swear, Franz Kafka's cockroach (he's a bit shy though), and =20

 >>i hear stormtroopers in the rite of spring moving into
Paris decades ahead of when they did

Would think the "fascist drumbeat" was also rock drumming,
stealing the rhythm from all the other instruments and
concentrating it for one guy with two sticks and a lot of
percussive surfaces. Or the hiphop drum machine--the
specialist again, the beat in charge of all the samples, the
rhythm you will like dammit because I say so.

Then I think about what the Nazis really liked: schmaltz,
sentimentality, hearts-on-sleeves, the quick manipulation of
fellow feeling, Wagnerian goosebumps becoming Wagnerian
goosesteps, the death of little Nell, doubling the woodwinds
in Beethoven's 4th with Furtwangler, the Spielberg
soundtracks that tell you what to feel about a movie scene,
the overkill of indication. You will cry now because it's
moving dammit...can't you hear the soundtrack?

Will loving more make us better fascist dictators of our
poems? Maybe. Maybe just give us more images. Or more
preconceptions we have to kill. But the real state secret,
the one we guard so closely, is that we're seldom in
control. You will find this post thoughtful because I say so
dammit.

Hello all,
I thought I'd take advantage of the collective wisdom of the list to ask for
some help.  I am compiling an author index to over 100 little magazines from
the 1960s/70s, loosely under the banner of the Mimeograph Revolution.  Below
is a list of individual issues from titles to be included in the project.  I
have not been able to find these issues after searching widely among
libraries and booksellers.  If you or anyone else you know might have copies
of these magazines, or if you have contact information for the editors,
please contact me at pathwisepress@hotmail.com.
Thank you.

Magazines:
Atom Mind #8 (Greg Smith, ed. Syracuse, NY) -- this should be the last issue
before the mag's hiatus
Beatitude #19 (Bob Kaufman, et al, eds. San Francisco)
Grist #1 & #13 (John Fowler, ed. Lawrence, KS) -- have found no evidence of
a #13
Yowl #1 (Erik Kiviat and George Montgomery, ed. NY, NY)

Has anyone ever used a blurb in a bio? Last time I try
to repackage this question. I am very interested in
others' experiences, opinions on this.

Apologize for being repetitive.

I've never done it, but if eh bio is more than a few sentences you might be
able to say, "So and so, the acclaimed poet, has praised the author's work
as 'greater than Shakespeare'" and embellish it slightly. You'd have to have
the right length bio & right context to make it fit.

Has anyone ever used a blurb in a bio? Last time I try
to repackage this question. I am very interested in
others' experiences, opinions on this.

Apologize for being repetitive.

Your post reminds me of a remark by Marshall McLuhan: "The future of the

The answer is "yes", AJ. I myself have not, but I seen
some bios that were almost nothing but blurbs.

when i'm on hiring committees etc. i have rec'd cvs and application
materials that include blurbs, reviews, etc; sometimes it seems like
overkill for a writer, but "normal" for a visual artist... is that
weird?

interesting you ask, since many of the factory school books have no bios,
tho some of them do; none have blurbs because there was some author
discussion about trying to forgo them -- but in the website info about the
books, Carol Mirakove and Kristin Prevallet have blurbs or reviewlets
(generally this sort of stuff is written by the author, so in this case,
re-placing the blurb here is more interesting than it might seem on the
surface)

and the blue lion books have no bios or blurbs or photos, tho some do have
some descriptive text on the website

then, or course, there's Jukka-Pekka Kervanen's ? I think book of blurbs --
if I'm getting it right, he wrote a blurb template for somebody, but then
ended up writing a book of blurbs.

Eileen Tabios solicited blurbs (on this list), and then was writing a book
to the blurbs.

part of the glory of job-hunting with an MFA is that other MFAs in other
arts may have reviews at a quite early stage, while as a writer, you are
less likely to have this type of comment; then you go to interviews and
unlike in the visual arts where it seems people are more cognizant of
galleries, curators, collectors, and teachers, you may even have a book or
two, and the interviewers don't know the press, the blurbers, the review
organs, so I've ended up trying to "sell" the press and the reviews (as I
haven't won any grants, fellowships, or prizes) -- you know, well, there's
no reason you'd have heard of Salt, they're not [local press x, or not
Harper Collins], but here's who they are, and what American Book Review is
-- it seems to me to be irresponsible to be making a creative writing hire
and know nothing about small press publishing

All best,
Catherine

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

The Fire: Collected Essays of Robin Blaser

Robin Blaser is Professor Emeritus at Simon Fraser University. Among
his many books are _The Holy Forest _(UC Press), _Pell Mell, _and
_Syntax_. Miriam Nichols is College Professor at University College
of the Fraser Valley and editor of _Even on Sunday: Essays, Readings,
and Archival Materials on the Poetry and Poetics of Robin Blaser._

http://go.ucpress.edu/Blaser

"In his exquisite articulations of the flowers of associational
thinking, Robin Blaser has turned knowledge into nowledge, the 'wild
logos' of the cosmic companionship of the real."-Charles Bernstein,
author of _Republics of Reality: 1975-1995_


Spanning four decades of meditation on the avant-garde in poetry,
art, and philosophy, the essays collected in _The Fire _reveal Robin
Blaser's strikingly fresh perspective on "New American" poets,
deconstructive philosophies, current events, and the state of
humanities now. The essays, gathered in one volume for the first
time, include commentaries on Jack Spicer, Charles Olson, Robert
Duncan, Mary Butts, George Bowering, Louis Dudek, Christos Dikeakos,
and J. S. Bach.
Blaser emerged from the "Berkeley Renaissance" of the 1940s and 1950s
having studied under legendary medieval scholar Ernst Kantorowicz and
having been a major participant in the burgeoning literary scene. His
response to the cultural and political events of his time has been to
construct a poetic voice that offers a singular perspective on a
shareable world-and to pose that voice alongside others as a source
of countermemory and potential agency. Conceived as conversations,
these essays brilliantly reflect that ethos as they re-read the
cultural events of the past fifty years.

Full information about the bookis available online:

and what of the human being who drives the ice cream truck and hears that

if you use a blurb in a bio is that a bio hazardous blurb or a

i'd say change 3 words is enough  i should have thought of that but
thought contract was preposterous  so far all but one i showed it to or
discussed it with agree

this kindof immoral can't hurt anyone
it's not like it's a close friend whose trust yer breaking
and if publisher has the layout i understand that too
he can complain too but thatt's his decision  too

since many folks are curious:

here every one send him work see if you get the same contract

Yes, it means either chicken fat (if you're making soup) or
excessive sentimentality in art or music. I intended the
second sense of the word.

"Around us, everything is writing; that's what we must perceive. Everything
is writing. It's the unknown in oneself, one's head, one's body. Writing is
not even a reflection, but a kind of faculty one has, that exists to one
side of oneself, parallel to oneself: another person who appears and comes
forward, invisible, gifted with thought and anger, and who sometimes,
through her own actions, risks losing her life. Into the night." --
Marguerite Duras

no but a good idea   who's blird ya wanna use?


oh and here's the latest  after i said  i wasn't retracting my poem but
questioning his ethics

on the level or not


Hi Steve,
I'll meet you in the middle. I've amended your contract to change the
following things:
1. no more $100 for publishing it elsewhere. Now $100 fine only if you go
behind my back and publish while I have it on level. You want to publish
it elsewhere, you just notify me first.
2. I changed the one year to six months, and the $50 penalty for removal
only goes up to three months, instead of the full year.
3. Remains the same: if you take it off the website, I won't put it in
any print anthology.

I hope this puts your worries to rest. I'm not an unfair guy. I just
think that if you commit the poem to me, then honor the commitment. So I
fixed your monetary penalties, and basically all you have to do when you
want the rights back (after three months) is say so. If you'll sign this
one, and get it to me, I'll publish your poem and be proud to do it.

Sorry for the contention.
F.

....reality is really a process,
undergoing constant transformation.

-- Paulo Freire,
Pedagogy of the Oppressed

Glad to see some dialogue around Elvira Arellano's
deportation case.  Thanks to all who have shared their
ideas both on the list serve and off.

In 2002, Elvira became a public figure here in
Chicago.  She was working as a cleaning woman and
arrested with 53 immigrant employees at O'Hare
airport.  This was a specific Department of Homeland
Security post-9/11 raid named "Operation Chicago Land
Skies."  There have never been any official claims
that these arrested workers were terrorists and many
of them have not been heard from.  But shortly after
her arrest, Elvira began her campaign of speaking out
for the rights of undocumented workers.

The U.S. immigration system is broken (and health care
and education and social security).  And this is no
surprise.  Our government has never handed out change.
People have had to demand change again and again: the
right to vote, to unionize, to have an abortion, etc.
In all of these cases, individuals have stepped
forward to test the system and create a historical
record for change.

Day by day make it new
cut underbrush
pile the logs
keep it growing.

-- Ezra Pound,
Canto 53

What is the responsibility of the poet?  More
importantly, what are our responsibilities to the
communities we live in, teach in, produce poetry in?
At the city college and in the public schools, I ask
my poetry students (mostly immigrant and black) to
take risks in their writing.  To question uses of
language.  To rethink metaphors.  I expect and
certainly hope their ideas will not just stay on the
page.  Taking risks also means taking risks in our
everyday lives.

The U.S. policy of uberconsumersim/globalcapitalism
has created extreme economic inequality around the
world.   According to the United Nations, 60% of
immigration represents people moving from poor
countries to richer countries.  People are desperately
risking their lives and willing to break laws.  Yet,
most Americans do not complain about illegal practices
while they are paying in cash for any of the leisure
services (gardeners, nannies, bus boys, prostitutes)
provided by undocumented workers.  The majority of
these low-wage workers are not involved with credit
card fraud, too difficult a pursuit if you are afraid
of being deported and looking to not draw any extra
attention to yourself.  If one is looking for
accountability, the powers that run the international
underground economy are a good place to start.

....the economy is a set of shared social practices,
ideas, and institutions that are created, maintained,
and reproduced by people....Progress towards economic
justice is not inevitable; it is won by people through
their work, individually and collectively, to better
the economic practices and institutions they have
inherited from the past.

-- Teresa Amott and Julie Matthaie,
Race, Gender, & Work

This is an experiment with a project that looks more like a traditional book
than most work I have done recently.  However, it would be prohibitively
expensive to print, because of the use of color-- so I took advantage of a
few web techniques -- mainly hyperlinks -- to move beyond a flat printed
page.

If not for the additional possibilities of web publishing over book
publishing, I am not even certain I would have thought of this project.  Our
imaginations -- or mine anyway -- are truly limited by the language we use
to express our ideas.  I.e. when in France long enough to begin "thinking in
French," I have noticed that my limitations in speaking French severely
limit my ability to reason in French.

1- Intersections a twenty-day journal of the unexpected, a pdf book by
Martha Deed

The Library of Marvels has another resident writer: Martha Deed. The library
of Marvels (http://arteonline.arq.br/library.htm) is a collection of my
electronic artist books and, sometimes, I invite some guest to stay there
with me. The first one was Joel Weishaus with his excellent "Traces of the
Catacombes", which I am sure all of you know very well . Now I am honored to
have Martha Deed and her "Intersections a twenty-day journal of the
unexpected", a pdf book at the library. To read this poetical book is a
great suggestion to this weekend. Below an abstract by Martha Deed, the
Author:

*********

"Intersections a twenty-day journal of the unexpected" is a mix of poetry,
texts, and photographs, and the constraint is that it is an imaginary trip
down Route 62 from Niagara Falls, NY to El Paso, Texas.  The actual Route 62
is more than 2,000 miles long, so I would "travel" approximately 100 miles a
day.  I wrote and "travelled" every day from April 11 - April 30, 2006,
which was also the 20 days immediately preceding an important birthday, so
it seemed a good time to stop and think.

I could not have imagined what lay ahead.

*********

Also you find this book at the museum's pdf library, at:

Comments will be welcome!

Let me boost the publisher's sales pitch by saying the title essay of =
Robin
Blaser's THE FIRE is alone worth the price of admission ($30.00 paper) =
--
it's one of the GREAT poetics essays of our time -- and the others are,
well, terrific bonus. The retrieval of Mary Butts is essential, =
especially
for those who have forgotten or never read her, and overall the book is =
FULL
of news (not read Dudek? Read Blaser, then go buy Dudek, yes, and keep =
him
by your bed (where you will read him) for a wonderful leisurely year). =
And
Miriam Nichols's editing is scrupulously exact, indeed enviably so. Not =
a
wasted word in this book, and thought for and of a lifetime.

November will bring (also from California) the super bonus, Blaser's THE
HOLY FOREST, with a bunch of new poems in it. From what I can see, it's =
only
available (to begin with) in hardcover, at $45.00. Save up! Splurge! =
Blaser
is one of the few poets who seem to have solved the problems involved
writing political poems. But that's only a part of it. He's funny, =
moving,
angry, loving, and every step of the way he's the scholar-poet exploring =
the
world, and the language the world is. Life-work. No question, he's a =
really
terrific poet, and the publication of this book solves pretty  well the
whole of my Christmas-present list.

Thanks to all those who offered their advice and poetics to the
  first version of the poetry cube.  We have worked out some bugs,
  redesigned a few things and are now sending this out again for your
  thoughts and poetics.

  The Poetry Cube (the first of three interactive digital poetic machines)
  acts as a bridge for print poets to rethink/create/write their poems in a 3-D, multi-dimensional, multi-linear form. We havent yet figured out how many different combinations one 16 lines poem creates once entered into the Poetry Cube, so explore and play and tell us your thoughts on how it makes you rethink your writing.

  THE URL: http://www.secrettechnology.com/poem_cube/poemcube.html

  Oh and please do send this url around....we need to rigorously test this creature.

  cheers, Jason Nelson

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Heidi,

on the untouched thread of poetry and pacifism.  I didn't
enter into the poetry and politics discussion, simply
because I'm tearing my hair out trying to do my tenure
dossier, take care of two young kids, prepare for semester,
and finish my book, "Behind the Lines: War Resistance Poetry
on the American Homefront, Since 1941."  Which is why I'm
responding to you.  The problem with the framing of "poetry"
and "politics" is that the discussion remained far too
abstract for my taste.  Poets have long engaged in a
symbiotic relationship with social movements, and my study
on poets and the peace movement marks the ways in which
poets negotiate their relationship between pacifist
audiences and the nation at large.  Some strong examples
that I consider are:

from WWII
William Everson's War Elegies, his "Chronicle of Division,"
William Stafford's poetry (throughout his career, as well as
his memoir of life in a conscientious objector camp during
WWIII), Robert Lowell's elliptical and self-
lacerating "Memories of West Street and Lepke."

from Vietnam
Denise Levertov's work throughout her career, from The
Sorrow Dance through her Vietnam poems, etc.
Plus the plethora of antiwar verse from Bly, Ginsberg, Rich,
MacLow, Daniel Berrigan, John Balaban, Sonia Sanchez, and
many many others

from the Gulf War
Barrett Watten's Bad History
William Heyen's Ribbons: The Gulf War
and many other anthologies and individual poems

Recent work spans the gamut, though I much appreciated in
2003 Brian Kim Stefans' site "Circulars," anthologies edited
by Leslie Scalapino, Kent Johnson's chapbook "Lyric Poetry
after Auschwitz," Mike Magee's "Political Song (Confused
Voicing)", the plethora of other anthologies out there, Bob
Perelman's poem about Dick Cheney's mind (the title evades
me now--it echoes Ginsberg's Wichita Vortex Sutra in some
strange way).

Anyway, it's pretty clear that if we define pacifism as
resistance to war (and not necessarily all wars, but limited
pacifism being resistance to a particular war), that you
have much to choose from.

Sincerely,

Very nice images. Someone should lay a copy of Ronald

Well put. Richard Wilbur, for example, supported the ousting
of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but opposed the war in Iraq.

Very cool! I enjoyed that a lot. I think the one thing it's really
missing is the diagonals. That is, I couldn't figure out how to get the
first line from the front, the second line from the shallow middle, the
third line from the deep middle, and the last line from the back as a
single set of four lines, and I very much would like to be able to do
that. Sort of turn the cube on it's corner and look at it on angle,
reading front to back one line, then two lines, then however many lines
you get until the number starts shrinking again.

also, the thing that struck me as the most pertinent was that this cube
thing is very much akin to received form, and it's a difficult one to
write in. Writing in it was very much like writing something like a
pantoum or villanelle  in that I had the same sort of feeling about the
nature of repetition and the need for things to fit together in a
structured way. I even found myself imposing greater dimensions of
structure, albeit fairly arbitrarily, just to see what would happen. I
think as an experiment I wasn't entirely unsuccessful, but I think it
would be much easier to think about the final product if the color
coding of the various layers were in some way present in the composition
application, so you could see at least a starting point of how the two
dimensional writing became three dimensional, at least partially. The
whole thing reminded me a great deal of hinton cubes, and the idea of
representations of higher dimensions in lower dimensions, which became
part of my subject matter. I don't know if that's necessarily because of
the form of the composition or if it's because I've been sort of
entranced by hypercubes lately.

those are my thoughts, hope they're helpful in some way.

yrs,
JFQ

1942-2006
Robert McCullough, civil rights organizer
By Kathy Durkin
Published Aug 24, 2006 10:11 PM
18 year-old Robert McCullough.

18 year-old Robert McCullough.

On Aug. 7, Robert Louis McCullough died at the age of 64 in Rock Hill,
S.C., where as an African-American student organizer during the 1960s,
he helped to make history in a landmark struggle against racism.

McCullough was born and raised in Rock Hill, a textile manufacturing
center near Charlotte. In 1957, two years after the historic Montgomery
bus boycott, the African-American community carried out the Rock Hill
bus boycott, which shut down that city’s segregated bus company.

Inspired by the growing movement against racist Jim Crow laws and
practices in the South, African-American students held a historic sit-in
at the segregated Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C. on
February 1, 1960, followed by six months of protests which won
desegregated lunch counters there.

The Greensboro actions set off demonstrations all over the South,
including in Rock Hill, where Black students marched for a year along
that city’s Main Street.

Eleven days after the ground-breaking Greensboro action, 100
African-American youth, mainly students at Friendship Junior College,
held the first South Carolina sit-ins at Rock Hill’s Woolworth’s and
McCrory’s lunch counters, followed by a year-long campaign there.

McCullough helped to organize a key protest in Rock Hill. His fellow
student participants appointed him as their leader. As his fellow
activist David Williamson explained, “He did all the detail work and
made sure everything was in place.”

On January 31, 1961, 18-year-old McCullough, along with eight other
African-American students from Friend ship and one civil rights
organizer, sat in at the “whites-only” lunch counter at McCrory’s. They
demanded service, which they were denied.

Arrested and tried on the official charges of “trespassing” and “breach
of peace,” these courageous young men were guilty only of seeking
justice and an end to racist discrimination.

But these activists brought a new tactic to this struggle. They pledged
among themselves to go to jail rather than pay fines or bail, which had
been the practice of previous sit-in protestors. When faced with paying
a $100 fine each or 30-day sentences at the York County Prison Farm with
forced labor on a chain gang, nine of them went to prison. That they
faced imprisonment or fines for fighting for justice was the real crime.

Racist prison officials saw to it that McCullough and seven of his
fellow activists served some time in solitary confinement, where they
subsisted on bread and water. The jailers were furious that they refused
orders to stop singing civil rights songs while daily loading 36
truckloads of dirt on the roadside chain gang.

“This was the first time anyone had served full sentences in the sit-in
movement,” commented historian Howard Zinn.

The struggle of the Friendship Nine proved to be a vital part of the
civil rights movement and inspired many youth.

After their jailing, four Student Nonviolent Coordi nating Committee
(SNCC) organizers went to Rock Hill to be arrested in solidarity with
them. They sat in at McCrory’s, were arrested and imprisoned. Then 100
activists went to jail in other cities, after similar anti-racist protests.

The “Jail, No Bail” stand taken by the Friendship Nine “made
electrifying news” within the civil rights movement, wrote Taylor Branch
in “Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63.” Besides
putting political pressure on the racist power structure, it put
financial pressure on them as well. Branch explains that this tactic
“obligated the white authorities to pay for [protesters’] jail space and
food.”

Also significant was the press coverage, particularly in the Baltimore
Afro-American Newspaper, and the mass support mobilized for the
Friendship Nine. The African-American community organized big, rousing
meetings. Picketers lined the street outside McCrory’s. SNCC mobilized
mass protests bringing African-American students from other cities.
Motorcades drove to the prison farm. Protesters even went to Washington,
D.C. Picketing continued in Rock Hill for a month after the Nine were
released.

Robert Louis McCullough, whom fellow activists described as “our
teacher” and called “our general” because of his leadership and
strategic skills, left a legacy of struggle and courage. Upon his death,
they recalled that he said to them while planning their bold action in
1961, that they were doing it “for all of humanity.” They also
recollected that at a recent Friendship Nine reunion he said to them,
“If we had to do it again, we’d do it again.”

The monumental civil rights struggle was marked by great courage,
boldness, organization, and untold sacrifices by many. The Friendship
Nine were a vital part of that history.

Hezbollah leader calls for ‘united front against imperialism’
Published Aug 23, 2006 11:05 PM

It is rare that readers inside the imperialist countries, especially in
the U.S., get the opportunity to read and hear the voices of people’s
resistance due to the blatant censorship of the big business media.
Therefore, Workers World is reprinting excerpts from an Aug. 14
interview with Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hasan Nasrallah that appeared in
its entirety on the Turkish Party of Labor website, www.emep.org. Roza
Cigdem Erdogan and Mutlu Sahin, reporters with the Turkish daily,
Evrensel, conducted the interview in Beirut.

Turkish Daily: Israel had claimed its aim was to destroy Hezbollah in
the first days of the occupation of Lebanon. How ever, it came across a
resistance it did not expect and now it has been falling short of this
aim. Through violent clashes, the occupying army continues to suffer
heavy loses. But this is not covered sufficiently by the media.

Hasan Nasrallah: They are writing that they are bombing the Hezbollah
positions and are deceiving the peoples. As you have witnessed
personally, this is a big lie! They are martyring the innocent
civilians. But, we are routing the Zionists wherever we come across
them. We are acting cautiously, and are not firing rockets on civilians.
By claiming that we are firing rockets on urban settlements, they are
seeking to deceive the peoples of the world. But we are firing rockets
under control on to locations we identified before. They are
deliberately driving the Israeli Arabs to the border. They are
presenting them as a target to us, but we are not playing into
provocation and mischief. Our target is not the civilians; it is the
Zionist military forces. Our fighters are routing extensively the
Zionist forces in the land operation. But they should also know that we
have still not used our important weapons. The Zionists, knowing that
they cannot daunt us with death, are attempting to destroy our
infrastructure, our roads, bridges, our women and children. This is how
they are trying to intimidate us. But, it is all futile, we will not
surrender! Apart from the freedom of our motherland, we will not accept
any other solution. We will resist and we will fight. Imperialism and
its Zionist contractors in the region should know that we are waiting
for the Zionists on every hill, every valley, every street and every
inch of our country. Our resistance necessitates victory. We have no
other way. This war will end with the victory of the oppressed of the
world and of the Muslims.

Is it possible for Lebanon to face once again the threat of a civil war?

Not only in Lebanon, but also in the region as a whole, the Zionist
regime is seeking polarization with the tension between ethnic groups,
sects and beliefs. Their strategy of attacking our country also confirms
this. But, the Hezbollah has spoiled this game. The oppressed peoples of
our country and of the Middle East have come to the defense of Hezbollah
and have provided their support. The socialists and Christians are
included in this.

What is the current state of your relations with the socialist movement?

The socialist movement, which has been away from international struggle
now for a considerable time, at last began to become a moral support for
us once again. The most concrete example of this has been Hugo Chávez,
the president of Venezuela. What most of the Muslim states could not do
has been done by Chávez by the withdrawal of their ambassador to Israel.
He furthermore com municated to us his support for our resistance. This
has been an immense source of morale for us. We can observe a similar
reaction within the Turkish Revolutionary Movement. We had socialist
brothers from Turkey who went to Palestine in the 1960s to fight against
Israel. And one of them still remains in my memory and my heart—Deniz
Gezmis [founder of the People’s Liberation Army of Turkey—WW] ...!

It is possible to see the posters of Che, Chávez, Ahmadinejad and
Hezbollah side by side in the streets of Beirut. Are these the signs of
a new polarization?

We salute the leaders and the peoples of Latin America. They have
resisted heroically against the American bandits and have been a source
of morale for us. They are guiding the way for the oppressed peoples. Go
and wander around our streets...! You will witness how our people have
embraced Chávez and Ernesto Che Gue vara. Nearly in every house, you
will come across posters of Che or Chávez. What we are saying to our
socialist friends who want to fight together with us for fraternity and
freedom, do not come at all if you are going to say religion is an
opiate. We do not agree with this analysis. Here is the biggest proof of
this in our streets with the pictures of Chávez, Che, Sadr and Hamaney
waving along together. These leaders are saluting our people in unison.
So long as we respect your beliefs, and you respect ours, there is no
imperialist power we cannot defeat!

Western governments are intensifying their pressure on Damascus and
Tehran for which they are proposing a change of regime. Some sources are
of the view that the attack on Lebanon will be directed on Syria. Is a
regional war possible?

The centers of imperialist power want to make collaborators of our
region as a whole. They expect us to kneel before them. Syria, Iran and
we are opposing this. The provocation concerning the former Leba nese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the efforts to secure the withdrawal of
the Syrian army from Lebanon and going even further, their wish to
attack callously on to Tehran and Damascus are all due to this reason.
Syria, with Iran and Hezbollah will certainly resist this. The
imperialists of the west are seeking to make a second Kosovo out of
Lebanon and our region. They are seeking to create a clash between
sects. But we have spoiled this trick. In our streets, the whole of
Lebanon, with its Christians, Sunnis and Shias, are flying the flags of
Hezbollah. Again, the unipolar world has already been left back in
history. There is us, there is Iran, there is Syria, there is Vene
zuela, Cuba and North Korea. There are the resisting peoples of
Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan! As long as there is imperialism and
occupations, these people will continue resisting. They can forget about
peace. If they want peace, they should now respect the freedom of
peoples and should eliminate the collaborating gangs. God willing, the
victory will be ours. They are not going to be able to turn our country
and region into a Kosovo. Now our people are aware of everything and
will not play into imperialist tricks. We will absolutely not permit
them to attack Iran or Syria. We are going to fight for our freedom to
the last drop of our blood. Let no one doubt this. They are claiming
that Iran has nuclear wea pons at its disposal. On the contrary, most of
the nuclear weapons are in the hands of the collaborating gang of Israel
and the U.S. Furthermore, nuclear wea pons are nothing but excuses put
forward in order to create collaborating regimes in the region.

There are claims that Hezbollah is being directed by Tehran.

This is a great lie. We are an independent Lebanese organization. We do
not take orders from anyone. But this does not mean that we are not
going to form alli ances. Let me reiterate, we are on a side. We are on
the side of Iran and Syria. They are our brothers. We are going to
oppose any attack directed at Tehran and Dama scus to the last drop of
our blood just as we do in Lebanon. We uphold global resistance against
global imperial terrorism. Peace cannot be unilateral. So long as there
is imperialism in the world, a permanent peace is impossible. This war
will not come to an end as long as there are occupations in Iraq,
Afghanistan and Palestine.

I've been revisiting and adding to/revising a piece i did that is never
finished called Arteroids. The new version isn't up yet, but the older
version is at http://vispo.com/arteroids

You'll note that when you 'lose' or 'win', a text is displayed. Below are
the texts that the program draws on in that situation. The texts are
short--they need to be short--because of the context. The subjects of the
texts are game, art, play, and poetry. Other of the texts say something
specific about the player having won or lost.

If you have any additions to this text, I'd appreciate it. I'd quote you
like the others are quoted, of course.

Thanks,
ja

here's the initial schpiel from that journal folks
send work NOW

about level: socially conscious poetry
level is an online project committed to publishing poems that display a
social consciousness of the issues in our everyday lives.


Mission The mission of levelpoetry.com is to use poetry to further a
populist discussion of modern cultural issues. The editors are seeking
writing by poets from America's modern diverse traditions.
There is a tide currently that is pushing poetry back into the
mainstream. In his 1991 essay "Can Poetry Matter?" Dana Gioia wrote: "It
is time to experiment, time to leave the well-ordered but stuffy
classroom, time to restore a vulgar vitality to poetry and unleash the
energy now trapped in the subculture." In his recent Poetry 180 project,
Billy Collins sought to have poetry disseminated to high school students
without academic pressure, simply giving them daily readings on the
morning announcements. The National Endowment for the Arts' Poetry Out
Loud program gives students the opportunity to win college scholarships
by competing on the classroom, school, state and then national levels by
giving the most effective readings of poems they choose from a wide array
of poets and styles. These sorts of ideas are what level is about:
helping to bring poetry back into mainstream life, free of academic
classroom pressure, free of expectations, and free from heavy canonical
constraints.
level is also about furthering a current, real world discussion by also
publishing interviews that contain well-thought-out ideas on poetry and
social consciousness.
level is not a forum for railing against the government, directionless
Bush-bashing, partisan rants, or quasi-intellectual foreign policy
discussions. Too often the solutions for social issues are sought in
legislation and public policy -- one lesson of the Civil Rights movement
is changing the laws is one thing but changing minds is another.
The editors value high quality writing by undergraduate and graduate
students because those young people should not be turned away for being
young.



Submissions
level is an online project committed to publishing poems that display a
social consciousness of the issues in our everyday lives.


What are the editors looking for?
"Socially conscious" means being aware of the reality around you.
It could mean many things, like community building, discussing a complex
problem, or demanding public attention for a real social issue.
Good and effective social commentary is not vague. It is specific and it
addresses the issue.
Socially conscious writing is not just name-calling, tirading against a
war, jabbing at a political party, or fingerpointing.
Don't think "government" or "corporation." Think "people."
If you need examples, read some poems in "From Totems to Hip-Hop" edited
by Ishmael Reed.
For Unsolicited Poems
Send 2-3 poems to level@levelpoetry.com and Put "poetry submission" in
the subject line of the e-mail.
In the body of the message, provide the poems and a 100-250 word synopsis
of what you have written and why you think it fits in level.
No attachments at all, ever!
Only e-mail submissions are accepted.
Provide a valid e-mail address that you actually check for a response.
For Unsolicited Interviews
Query first! via e-mail with "Interview query" in the e-mail's subject
line.
Interviews must be fully transcribed and accompanied by an authenticity
statement swearing on your granny's grave that the transcript is totally
accurate.
Interviews should be with poets or poetry publishers speaking on issues
of social consciousness and poetry.

Suggestions for submitting writers:
Don't try sending 20 poems broken down into 10 e-mails. Send 2-3 poems,
and wait for answer.
Before submitting consider signing up for our mailing list. If you don't
want to hear from us, we might not want to hear from you either.
Send a cover letter that makes us believe that we want to work with you.
Being terse and unfriendly won't make us believe that.
You'll hear back about your work. If you haven't heard back within three
months of submitting, inquire (politely) via e-mail.
The only thing worse than a bad writer is a belligerent writer.
Simultaneous submissions are not accepted. Either send your work to level
or to someone else.
Payment and Rights
level does not pay at this point.
level retains first North American rights. A work published in level may
not be re-published in North America prior to one calendar year after the
release date of the work.
Students:
The editors of level encourage submissions from undergraduate and
graduate students. Although level is not dedicated to student writing,
their participation is encouraged. (You must be 18 years of age or older
in order to sign a contract to publish.)

anybody know what hegullah megullah means or some such spelling? i came
across it in a collection of folk tales, made note of it and did not make
note of the meaning. i ve exhausted most obvious means of searching. a
reunion with its meaning would be a delight. meant to chime in when the
discussion about politics in poems was going on that it just seems bizarre
than to some "political" poetry is taboo. a good poem is a good poem
whatever its subject matter.susan maurer

Don't know about the two words together. "Gantse Megillah" is Yiddish for an
overly long speech. "Hagullah" is a celebratory dance of Libya and Egypt. So
the phrase might be a paste up of Yiddish and Arabic for something like a very
long celebration. does that make sense?

>>"Gantse Megillah" is Yiddish for an overly long speech.

Actually, this is the slang usage -- originally it referred to the
scriptural reading of the Book of Esther (Megillat Esther) on the spring
holiday of Purim. Jews are supposed to hear the "complete scroll" (_di
gantse megillah_) twice over the course of the holiday. Since it takes
about half an hour to 45 minutes to read the entire scroll out loud,
this took on the meaning of reading/declaiming for a long time, hence
the slang use of the term.

I recently found a similar etymology for "sockdolager," which is the
coup de grace that finishes off an opponent (American English still uses
the expression widely in the term "sock" -- sock it to me!)... from what
I've read, the original term comes from a folk mis-spelling/-hearing of
"doxology," which is supposed to be the last portion of a church service
before the folks get to go home. so from this comes the meaning of a
"finishing blow" that closes off the service - boxing match - agon
-whatever.

sei gezint, people...

Good morning, all! Kathy Ernst and I have conferred about upcoming projects regarding the presentation of female visual poets. We are looking to build a database of contact information for women on several continents, so that we may look at what is possible relative to exhibitions (likely, a traveling exhibition initially) and books that would go with same.

  Specific calls for work will follow, but for now we want to accumulate a "who's who" compendium.

  I would appreciate your circulating widely a call for the following information and sending the information to me backchannel at:

  sheila dot murphy at gmail dot com

  We mainly want:

  Name
  Mailing Address
  Email Address

  Any further information about media in which the visual poet works, great, too.

  If everyone can respond with known individuals, including yourselves, it will be appreciated.

  The goal is to obtain as comprehensive a list of (1) living women visual poets who have done visual poetry in the latter half of hte 20th Century and (2) women who are actively working in visual poetry now. Definition of visual poetry is deliberately open.

  Thanks! Sheila Murphy

Ha. Isadore Isou's http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lettrist/isou-m.htm
(1947) is sort of Zarathustrian in its tone of soaring discontent, only
concerning poetics, not philosophy. Not in any concept of the 'Superman' a
la Nietzsche, but this: "ISOU   Will unmake words into their letters. Each
poet will integrate everything into Everything   Everything must be revealed
by letters."

Also, earlier than that is Apollinaire who, in his 1917 essay L'Esprit
Nouveau et les Poetès, said:

"Typographical artifices worked out with great audacity have the advantage
of bringing to life a visual lyricism which was almost unknown before our
age. These artifices can still go much further and achieve the synthesis of
the arts, of music, painting, and literature ... One should not be
astonished if, with only the means they have now at their disposal, they set
themselves to preparing this new art (vaster than the plain art of words) in
which, like conductors of an orchestra of unbelievable scope they will have
at their disposal the entire world, its noises and its appearances, the
thought and language of man, song, dance, all the arts and all the
artifices, still more mirages than Morgane could summon up on the hill of
Gibel, with which to compose the visible and unfolded book of the future....
Even if it is true that there is nothing new under the sun, the new spirit
does not refrain from discovering new profundities in all this that is not
new under the sun. Good sense is its guide, and this guide leads it into
corners, if not new, at least unknown. But is there nothing new under the
sun? It remains to be seen."

Also, my friends in the Seattle visual poetry scene mainly of the eighties
and nineties--Joe Keppler, Trudy Mercer, Geof Huth, Nico Vassilakis,
margareta waterman, and others--practice an art of synthesis of arts and
media--together with an intelligent discontent--and this was the more
profound influence on me, I imagine, being close to home and personal. I
started visiting Seattle in the eighties and lived there for four years in
the nineties. I was living there when I did
http://vispo.com/E/ABCArchitectureL.html around 1998 or 1999. They were OK
with my trying to use things like Photoshop, CorelDraw/Paint, and then the
DHTML and Director work. Their poetics of synthesis didn't rule it out. I
felt at home there.

But I suppose Nietszche's Zarathustra is in there too, amongst Isou,
Apollinaire, and the Seattleites. Everybody knows that work, in some sense.
I read it a long time ago more for its style, I think, than its content.

I've been enjoying your work, Peter, as you post it to the list. It's
distinctive in visual poetry. It's left the page though not abandoned it.
And is possibly concerned as much with landscape painting art as with the
page. People seem to see their own concerns in it, also, which is always 'a
good sign'--it's generatively suggestive.

I am hoping you will do some 3D literary machines, at some point.

I think that getting a sense of the visual poetic possibs of 3D space is
interesting. Your work is more developed than most other poetical work I've
seen for the screen that approaches the 3D. Partly because you treat it as a
continuum and as worldly, perhaps, rather than as page-like content arranged
in 3D space. The shapes and the space are treated as being as of much
interest as the linguistic element.

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
         New obstacles for exchange arise
         Or unfold,
         O ye postmasters!


         1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv          was founded
by Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation,
    the list has about 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a
substantial          number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the
list through our web          site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion          of
poetry or for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform,
      and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to
innovations,          renovations, and investigations of form
and/or/as content, to the questioning          of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined,
untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize
that          other lists may sponsor other possibilities for
exchange, we request that          those participating in this forum
keep in mind the specialized and focused          nature of this
project and respect our decision to operate a moderated          list.
The Poetics List exists to support and encourage divergent points
    of view on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and
poetics,          and we are committed to do what is necessary to
preserve this space for          such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer          maintain
the open format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).
        The specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively
fluid one:          in most cases, messages are reviewed after having
been posted to the list,          and difficulties resolved on that
basis; however, the listserv editorial          board may shift
between this and a pre-review mode which calls for all
messages to be read and approved before being forwarded to the list.
We          prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the spontaneity
of discussion          that we hope to promote. In addition to these
options, the editorial board          will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively          contributing to
the list or following our guidelines. We remain committed          to
this editorial function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a private list and          information
about this list should not be posted to other lists or directories
     of lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific          rather than general interests, and also to keep the
scale of the list          relatively small and the volume manageable.
The current limits of the          list are generally 50 messages per
day, and one or two messages per subscriber          per day; but
these limits are subject to change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html,          some
posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements,
         etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's          edited
collection of the Poetics List; this is available from          ROOF
and also on line          at the EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages          are
reviewed by the editors in keeping with the goals of the list as
articulated          in this Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned          with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics
   and political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also
welcome.          We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links,          relating to publications
(print and internet), reading series, and blogs          that they
have coordinated, edited, published, or in which they appear.
Such announcements constitute a core function of this list. Brief
reviews          of poetry events and publications (print or digital)
are always welcome.

We do not accept postings of creative work not          directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics
 List is not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems
or          journal entries.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List.          Send messages
directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


         3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe          (join) a
List." Immediately following your subscription to the poetics
listserv we ask that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line
"registration,"          with your full name, street address, email
address, and telephone number.          Failure to register at the
time of subscription will result in automatic          deletion from
the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions          of the
different subscription options please see section 3), click on
 "Subscriber's Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge,          but
formal registration is required. All other questions about
subscriptions,          whether about an individual subscription or
subscription policy, should          be addressed to this same
administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information          and
correspondence remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real          name, as
registered. If there is any discrepancy between your full name
 as it appears in the "from" line of the message header, please
  sign your post at the bottom. Subscribers who do not include their
full          name with each post will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is          bounced
messages. If your system is often down or if you have a low disk
   quota, Poetics messages may get bounced, which will result in your
subscription          being automatically terminated by the Listserv
program and the automatically          generated message telling you
that this has occurred will also likely          bounce. If this
happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same          process
described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the future:
     set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
   web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options          via the
link on the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.          If
you would prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>          the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu          this one-line message with no
"subject": sub poetics [your Firstname          and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our          web
interface and not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining
        subscribed to the list and so eligible to send us posts, send
this one-line          message to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with
no "subject":          set poetics nomail. Note: this option is also
useful for temporary suspension          of email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
     this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will          receive the
day's individual posts in one email sent just after midnight
EST), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message
   with no "subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will          receive
individual postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive          a list,
without the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each
day along with the author's name and address and the number of lines
it          comprises; you can also choose to have the index sent to

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription          in
default or digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended
      period of time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose
Poetics          messages as well as other important mail. In such

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription          options),
again, we strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side
of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html          You
may also may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>          with no "subject": unsub
poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please          note:
sometimes your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
       administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send
messages to          Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will
continue to receive mail          from the Poetics List. To avoid this
problem, unsub using your old address,          then resubscribe with
your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated            on the Poetics List.
We define 'flaming' as any post that resembles a            personal
attack or personal insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This
 of course includes racist, sexist, or other slurs as well as ad
hominem arguments in which            the person rather than their
work is attacked; in other words while critique            of a
person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the main
functions            of the list), this critique cannot extend to a
critique or criticism of            the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow
pseudonymous subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List
                 should be sent in Text-Only format, without
attachments. We do not accept                  HTML-formatted messages
or attached files. As a general rule, keep individual          posts
to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the          express
permission of the author. Posting on the list is a form of
publication.          Copyright for all material posted on Poetics
remains with the author;          material from this list and its
archive may not be reproduced without          the author's
permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair          use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property          of the
authors; before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part,
    we ask that you get permission (by email is fine) from the
authors. If          they give permission, then we ask only that you
say that the post or posts          appeared originally on the Poetics
List (http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html)          on [give
date and say:] Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than          2 messages
per day from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal          is
a manageable list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers),
      the list accepts 50 or fewer messages per day.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be          down: if you
feel your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait          at
least one day to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be
     sure the message is not posted there; if you still feel there is
a problem,          you may wish to contact the editors at
<poetics@acsu.buffalo.edu>.

i saw that there was a new journal for socially conscious poetry.

that should help alleviate all the socially unconscious poetry.

here is my favorite poem on the subject, by  JML

it's presnted here without permission





Social Significance


They tell me now
They want a poem
with social significance
With social and economic meanings
(Preferably of their own choosing)
That now is the open season
On Ivory Towers

Tell me, comrade:
Is there any poem
Which doesn=92t have
This social significance?
No matter how thin its inspiration
Or banal its subject,
My dear friend,
Can you imagine a poem,
Which is still a poem,
And doesn=92t have
Social significance?

If it is a poem
It will affect people:
Thence will spring
Its social significance.

Subject:      New from Palm Press: The Present Work by Matvei Yankelevich
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Palm Press is pleased to announce the publication of our first 2006 =
chapbook:

THE PRESENT WORK=20
by Matvei Yankelevich

Marcel Duchamp once said: "It all started with Gustave Courbet." Should =
the avant garde of today pay for the mistakes of its inspirational =
predecessors? In The Present Work, movement and moment, Marcel Duchamp =
and Gustave Courbet, crows and poets, progress and chance, all toggle =
back and forth between each other, contesting history, primacy, ideas of =
beginning and ending. The continuum is broken, parts become autonomous. =
The moment is separate from all other moments-it drops out of the line, =
out of the set, out of the continuum. The Cast of Characters includes a =
Scrap of Paper, Definition, Back Home, Interjection, Martini, Synopsis, =
Transcript, unknown soldiers of poetry, and many more.=20

Matvei Yankelevich is an editor of Ugly Duckling Presse, a non-profit =
volunteer-run publishing concern in Brooklyn. He translates Daniil =
Kharms, Alexander Vvedensky and Vladimir Mayakovsky, among other Russian =
writers. He teaches Literature at Hunter College in New York City while =
working on a graduate degree in Comparative Literature and a house is =
the country.

*

Many people have eagerly anticipated the publication of Matvei's book =
and we're happy to say-- this chapbook contains excellent writing, has =
been beautifully designed (with original cover art by poet and artist =
Jen Bervin), was carefully made and is now--launched into the world. =
Check it out:

The Present Work, a chapbook-length poem by Matvei Yankelevich

NEW FROM THE UNIVESITY OF ALABAMA PRESS!!
BLUE STUDIOS
Poetry and Its Cultural Work
Rachel Blau DuPlessis
A new collection of essays that continues the work begun in The Pink Guitar!
“Blue Studios is an intriguing defense of ‘affective reading,’ a defense
and demonstration of some adventurous and nonstandard modes of
essay-writing, and a suggestion of a kind of utopian horizon for
poetry/poetics. A major collection by one of the most important poets
and critics writing today, it is a proper (and improper) successor to
The Pink Guitar.”
—Hank Lazer, coeditor, Modern and Contemporary Poetics
Rachel Blau DuPlessis is a poet, critic, and Professor of English at
Temple University. She is the author/editor of more than 20 volumes of
poetry and criticism.

THE PINK GUITAR
Writing as Feminist Practice
Rachel Blau DuPlessis
A landmark study of women’s writing and poetics—now back in print!
“One of the boldest, most enlightening, innovative, challenging, and
knowledgeable works of feminist theory to grace the last couple of
decades.”—Martha Nell Smith, Tulsa Studies in Women’s Literature
“Establishes a powerful feminist writing practice not because of
DuPlessis’s refusal of authority, transcendence, and singularity, but
because of the ways she redeploys these.”—Jeanne Heuving, Contemporary
Literature

--Joel,  i didn't catch the author of this poem?

--i'm always losing the ends of lines

--it is interesting to locate the significance of the poem in the
reader rather than
in the making
i think the act of putting words on paper is a kind of peace-making
with the world
a kind of recognition of the otherness of
everything else -- and letting go of the world in speaking it -- a
kind of "i and thou"
--naming birds in flight
--if a hermit speaks from a cell it is to a world that is necessarily passing by
--position of detachment -- -
--this is not about the politics of the poem per se but about the kind
of pile of
rocks one makes in the act of writing
--and within the rocks lights in the soil under the mantle
--and then the reader as another "thou"
--and then nonviolence which can lead to nonviolence

for some reason the last line of my posts is always clipped.  does

anyone else have that problem?

here is the poem with the last line, the "date of composition"


Social Significance


They tell me now
They want a poem
with social significance
With social and economic meanings
(Preferably of their own choosing)
That now is the open season
On Ivory Towers

Tell me, comrade:
Is there any poem
Which doesn't have
This social significance?
No matter how thin its inspiration
Or banal its subject,
My dear friend,
Can you imagine a poem,
Which is still a poem,
And doesn't have
Social significance?

If it is a poem
It will affect people:
Thence will spring
Its social significance.

heidi-- the author of that poem was jackstone mack lowe  -- i don't =20
want this post turning up in internet searches, so i've misspelled =20
his name

i was going to change the poem to make a reasonable commentary on it, =20=

passing souter's "two live crew" test, but then figured it was an =20
illustration.  i contemplated posting it at the end of a 3,000 page =20
document but then thought better of it.

is anyone on this list at the jackstone mack lowe memorial service--=20
in february of 05, i think it was?   i'd be interested in conversing =20
with people who were there who want to talk about the reception of =20
mac low generally but most specifically after his death.

anyhow, i'm pretty confident people are not reading this far down the =20=

page, so i'll post another poem in this strain.

i'm not sure it's valid, but i want to distinguish poems which do =20
cultural work and poems by cultural workers... poems that "are =20
radical" (whether in form or content or both) and poems by people who =20=

are "radical" (whether in form or content or both)....   so for =20
example, a "political poem" by wallace stevens, for example, or, a =20
poem by the women of the weather underground....   note that the WUO =20
book "Sing a Battle Song" is now out and is quite beautiful.   =20
another gift to the people of queens.

here is a poem -- a social poem posed differently, from that book:




Waiting*


This is the way we learn humility.
How many times have people sat
and waited alone in a house
waiting for the comrades
to come back?
The battle is planned
Every minute is accounted for
Every person knows her job
All care has been taken.
Tonight, how many guerrillas are fighting battles?
Tonight, the radio reports
the police are attempting to drive
hundreds of demonstrators back from the streets.
Rocks are flying,
you can hear the chants, the breaking glass,
the sirens behind the nervous newsman=92s patter.
Eleven o=92clock.
Not done yet.
How many have been done before us?
The line stretches back
through history.
How many are there still to do?



Autumn 1971

*Written on the night of the bombing of William Bundy=92s office in the =20=

MIT Research Center, done by the women=92s Proud Eagle Tribe.





compare that with a poem written ostensibly by another woman in that =20
group (all the poems in the book are anyonymous, so we don't know if =20
any were written by judge bernadine dorn, or who).  many of the poems =20=

are fairly straightforward in their "arguments" -- i've picked two =20
that are, well, ahem, a little more nuanced.     tomorrow, i'll post =20
some samples of reina maria rodriguez, a cuban poet popular among =20
many on this list, who embodies the "political" differently....     =20
(perhaps we can start to disentangle here in this space the =20
difference between "political" and "social" poetry.  because we're =20
presenting partly on this topic (with R. Levitsky) at RAT at Godard =20
at the end of september -- anyone here going to RAT? -- and while i =20
appreciated philip metres generous listing of pacifist poets, and =20
what he's done and does, especially as an editor, i think it would be =20=

important to return to some of his choices for further critical =20
evaluation, because i think it's really easy to sit somewhere in the =20
suburbs and write "pacifist poetry" -- the anti war pacifists -- such =20=

as those in the why/resistance circle in new york in 40s, etc., some =20
of them actually made pacifism an active proposition-- say, =20
demonstrating in support of hunger-striking "conscientious objetors" =20
at danbury federal prison.   before we start patting ourselves on all =20=

the hard work our poems do, i'd rather back up and take a deep =20
breath.    anyhow, here is another poem, and i think it's really pitiful








Spider Poem


spider, spin me a world web
touch women far away
I go slide down the strands
subway spider strands
to other lands
touch other hands

spider, spider, a world web
a meeting place
to share a meal, a cup of rice
a night of stories
a day=92s toil
tired hands from the field
smell of soil
warm baths and back rubs
shared children
shared fire
shared burdens
gentle hands for bodies
tense and bent

spider, spider, storm the land with
silken strands like fine fine
hair (see those threads glisten)
listen by the fire. Shhhhhh
a child cries,
tired raspy voice
soft soft body molded round
into an olden arm, rough
like tree bark, tough
she cradles that baby strong
and gentle
(the earth, she bears scars
tunnels, ditches carved
like the lines in an old
woman=92s face
hides children to be safe
woven folds of skin
for children to be safe
from bombs and lines of
fire)

spider, spider
weave me a web,
a world web
stretch your special liquid
around the land,
above the waters,
through tall trees
We will meet
all of us
women of every land
children on backs,
in arms, in shopping carts
We will meet
in the center
make a circle
to discuss
to simply discuss
to simply discuss amongst
ourselves
our lives
and what is to be done
and with our fine spidernet
we intend
to entangle
the powers
that bury
our children

my friends at anarchist paper fifth estate hated this poem, since hey =20=

have funny ideas about poetry, have little patience for the WUO (in =20
some cases having been around for the street fights, etc.) -- but =20
mostly because they have never gone to professional poet  or =20
professional critic school.   while there is a lot to dislike about =20
this poem, i think it's interesting and worth thinking about as an =20
artifact of that time.   there are a bunch of people on this list who =20=

taught me how to read without getting mixed up with making aesthetic =20
judgments.     i think the reading of poetry -- as a nuanced act =20
informed by certain literary and cultural theories, yes, say bourdieu =20=

of raymond williams -- has something to teach leftwing activist =20
culture.    (this is something i've learned, anyhow).   i'm not sure =20
that this was always the case

anyhow, this pretty much uses up my two posts.

HELP! please order factory school books.   since bill and i both =20
moved to the city, we're now facing extreme cash crunch and our =20
ability to do these projects is seriously impeded without further =20
sales.   i know of two courses in queens that are using this WUO book =20=

in class, and if anyone wants to use them in a class, it really helps =20=

to sell a bunch of books at once.






For the SLA


They call it terror
if you are few and have no B-52s
if you are not a head of state
with an army and police
if you have neither napalm
nor tanks nor electronic battlefields
terror is if you are dispossessed
and have only your own two hands
each other
and your rage
It is not terror
if you are New York=92s Finest
and you shoot a ten-year old Black child in the back
because you think Black people
all look like
they=92ve just committed a robbery
It is not terror if you are ITT
and buy the men
who line Chilean doctors up in their hospital 		corridors
and shoot them for supporting the late
democratic government of their country
It is not terror but heroism
if you were captured by the Vietnamese
for dropping fragmentation bombs
on their schools and hospitals
Only those who have nothing
can be terrorists

Brothers and sisters, let us choose
our weapons carefully and humanely
let us use no torture
or napalm
or genocide
but do not be fooled
there is no weapon they will allow
nothing that works will be called legitimate
unless we fight for it
unless we educate ourselves and others
unless we separate resistance from oppression
The same editorials that scream terrorism
screamed mob rule
at the civil-rights marches of the early sixties
at the anti-war demonstrations
thousands of busted heads later
they say, of course
we always upheld the right to peaceful protest

The attitudes they offer up in print
with little tabs, cut them out and wear them
written by men who have not seen
a jail cell from the inside
or hunger
or the face of a duly constituted officer
of the law as he says
make one move and you=92ll be dead
they say we cannot condone violence
but watch out
for whether they say it about murdering prisoners
at Attica
or about kidnapping Patricia Hearst
about the disinherited
or about the inheritors

As we find our way slowly
to use the means available to us
as wisely as we can
there will be mistakes
but do not let the enemy
define the mistakes
because he is experienced
and has ten thousand printing presses at his back
behind which he hides the tanks and guns
he will say, the people don=92t support you
and saying it can make it so
if we agree
he will say, you only turn off
those you say you are fighting for
he is helpful
no anti-war march
no sit-in
no teach-in
but had its helpful editor to say
how much more we could accomplish by doing less
or preferably nothing
while the people of Vietnam
patiently explained their cause to the world
but did not stop shooting down the bombers
for fear of alienating someone

Watch out
for what they turn into news
and what they quietly forget
What if all the headlines
and stories about Solzhenitsyn
had said instead
Millions of Humans
Held in Semi-Slavery
Deprived of Every Human and Legal Right
Families Forcibly Torn Apart
Strikes Broken by Mass Murder
Hundreds of Thousands Imprisoned Without Trial
in Southern Africa?
(Is it because of their impartial humanity
that they hear
the cry of one czarist intellectual
drowning out the screams of
20 million Black Africans?)
Or 25,000 U.S. Troops Remain in Thailand
the war in Southeast Asia
isn=92t over but continues
directed as before by U.S. officials
and U.S. money
U.S. advisors who changed their uniforms
into civilian clothes and call it by another name
or worse, do not call it anything at all
but hope the world will forget
and let them carry on their dirty business undisturbed
while solemn conferences are held on what to do
about the =93international terrorism=94 of the Palestinians
who disrupt the peaceful prosperity of tourism
with annoying reminders
that their land has been stolen from them
and they have been left with nothing
but their courage and the justness of their cause
with which to win it back
poor enough weapons
we can help supply some others
by shouting and whispering on every corner
the story of their struggle
a people utterly deprived of its homeland

Sisters and brothers, think hard before you jump
onto the bandwagon
of condemning terrorism
remember who is making the definitions
remember not to strengthen the hand
that will turn in an instant
against every means of resistance to oppression
That bandwagon rolls straight toward fascism
do not forget the real terrorists
that lurk behind the masks of heads of state
do not be afraid to hold strong together
with all who dare to struggle.

That's an interesting perspective. I've always thought that one of the majo=
r faults of the various descendents of the New Left is their rampant, unack=
nowledged, middle class elitism. It's part and parcel of what's alienated a=
nd weakened labor in the united states, and without labor, the left doesn't=
 have an organizational base beyond a small group of efete, self-congratula=
tory middle class self-described "activists" who are completely politically=
 ineffective. the left is nothing without the support of the people it aims=
 to serve, and since the sixties and the mindbogglingly stupid antics of gr=
oups like the weathermen, the left has done nothing to earn the support of =
those people. quid pro quo=3Dgeorge w. bush.

The Mind is a Metaphor
A Database of Eighteenth-Century Metaphors of Mind

Assembled and Taxonomized by Brad Pasanek, Annenberg Center for
Communication, University of Southern California.
This collection of eighteenth-century metaphors of mind is part of a
scholarly study of the metaphors and root-images appealed to by the
novelists, poets, dramatists, essayists, philosophers, belle
lettrists, preachers, and pamphleteers of the eighteenth century.
While the database does include metaphors from classical sources,
from Shakespeare and Milton, the King James Bible, and more recent
texts, it does not pretend to any depth or density of coverage in
literature other than that of the British eighteenth century.

What would be cool would be poets retracting poems by other poets.

I for one would revel in writing a palinode of "stopping by the woods on a snowy evening." I could even imagine an anthology of palinodes of that one specific poem, or it and a few others. Of course, i have no idea how one goes about putting together an anthology, but somebody should do that.

Hi everyone - settling into Atlanta and trying to figure out where the
poetry is - does anyone know if the Atlanta Poets Group is still
around?  Their website has been disabled and my google search hasn't
turned up much.  And any other reading series other than Poetry at
Tech?

thanks for tips! (but no tips for thanks - couldn't resist--)

Dear Lori,

The Atlanta Poetry Group certainly is very much around, or was in April =
when I read with Randy Prunty at Emory.  He was electric.  Also met with =
John Lowther, Tracey Gagne, Mark Prejsnar, Alka Roy, and more -- and heard =
enough about missing members to seriously want to meet them too.  It was a =
very sweet reading, arranged by the APG and hosted by Bruce Covey, with a =
small, keen, ultra-alert attendance.  We all got together afterwards & it =
was the best!  Great conversation, unbeatable commitment.  John Lowther =
gave me a big envelope stuffed with APG publications.  The whole thing was =
bracing.  As the AWP will be in Atlanta in 2007 I gave heavy encouragement =
for an APG event on or off program; I hope to god I have to a chance to =
hear more from these guys and get some of that old APG superfuel again.

 >>I for one would revel in writing a palinode of "stopping
by the woods on a snowy evening."

Here's my palinode of Allen Ginsberg's "A Supermarket in
California." -EY

___________


A Book Store in Manhattan


    What little warning I had of you tonight, Allen Ginsberg,
as I walked up Broadway in headlights with a broken CD
player, self-consciously admiring the new Time-Warner Building.
    In my fatigue, and shopping for new career skills, I went
into a chain book store, not dreaming of any chance meeting!
    What caffeination and what penury!  Whole condos
shopping at night!  Carpets full of grad-students!  Wives in
the Self Help, babies in the bestsellers!--and you, Noam
Chomsky, what were you doing in the humor section?

    I saw you, Allen Ginsberg, childless, salacious old
professor, poking among magazines in the front and eyeing
the male booksellers.
    I heard you asking questions of each: Who buys for the
poetry section? Where do you hold signings?  Are you the
manager?
    I wandered in and out of the displays of faced-out
paperbacks avoiding you, but monitored along with everyone
else, by the store surveillance system.
    We skirted past each other in the thronged aisles nimble
in our pretended reading of XML and wine guides, possessing
every professional perk, but never acknowledging the
homeless spare-changer outside.

    Where are you going, Allen Ginsberg?  I am going the
other way.  Which way do your worn Buddhist boots point tonight?
    (I think of your book and Homer's Odyssey side-by-side
in the book store and feel absurd.)
    Will I have to pretend to walk all night through
expensive streets?  The cabs add yellow to shade, lights out
in the stores, if I'm late again we'll both be unemployed.

    Will I be able to stroll dreaming of the lost America of
the Sixties past white stretch-limos in garages, home to my
yuppie neighborhood?

    Ah, dead icon, East Village celebrity, lucky old
derelict teacher, what America did you have when hipsters
began reading obituaries and you stepped from a smoke-free
bank and stood watching the ferry disappear to the black
shore of New Jersey?

Manhattan, 2003

Regards to all,
Eric Yost

Breakdown FM: Always Strength in Words-An Interview w/ Hasan Salaam,
Akir and Hiccup [1]

Thereâ€™s Always Strength in Words:

An Interview w/ Hasan Salaam, Akir and Hicoup

By Davey D

Whoever said Conscious Hip Hop artists canï¿½t get down or that Hip Hop
from the NY (East Coast) is dead simply has not tapped into the
burgeoning cultural inspired rap scene that has everyone from dead prez
to Immortal Technique making noise. Alongside them are artists like
Hasan Salaam, Hicoup and Akir just to name a few. We sat down with them
the other day when they swung through Oakland for the Strength in Words
Tour.

I gotta be honest it was nice building with these cats. In fact we
barely spoke about their projects, which include Hasanï¿½s ï¿½Lost Paradiseï¿½
album, Hicoupâ€™s Ghetto Factory Supremeï¿½ mixtape and Akirï¿½s debut LP
ï¿½Legacyï¿½. Instead we talked in depth about the Middle East including the
conflict in Lebanon. This was critically important especially when you
take into account that Hasan has a song on his album called ï¿½Hezbollahï¿½.

We spoke about the upcoming anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and where
we are at as a community and what we should be doing at this time
especially when we note that so many people from New Orleanï¿½s are still
displaced.

Most important in our conversation was hearing the solutions that these
gentlemen offered up. Hasan and Akir spoke in great detail about how one
can manifest revolutionary and spiritual politics in their day to day
lifestyle. Hicoup really broke things down by warning against the
forming of Black Power cults filled with people who divide the
community. He said just because someone listens to 50 Cent Vs. Talib
Kweli does not make you better or worse. He noted that far too often we
get caught up on trying to see who is and isnï¿½t a real revolutionary and
who isnï¿½t.

After building with these cats, thereï¿½s was no denying their skillz on
the mic. Thereï¿½s no denying their politics. Thereï¿½s no denying the type
of excitement they are generating coast to coast.

No, they are likely not to show up on MTV or BET. I doubt if Hot 97 will
play them anytime soon, but so what? Does that mean they arenï¿½t
knocking? Does that mean they wonï¿½t pack the house? In a day where
commercial artists are experiencing waning album sales, the underground
is finding itself resurging. Hasan, Akir and Hicoup are proof positive
that maintaining some principles and holding true to your values will
pay off in the end.

Subtext continues its monthly series of experimental writing with
performances
by HOWEVER & Bill Horist at Richard Hugo House on Wednesday, September 6,
2006.
Donations for admission will be taken at the door on the evening of the
performance.  The reading starts at 7:30pm.

Bill Horist's improvised, prepared guitar work is informed by Hans Reichel,
Fred
Frith, and Henry Kaiser, but shows a unique style and personality.  Since
moving
to Seattle in 1995, he has established himself as a noted
improviser/performer
along the West Coast and beyond. He has performed over 600 concerts in the
past
9 years in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe and Japan.

Horist improvises and composes for film, dance and theater as well. In the
Fall
2002, he was composer in residence at the Banff Centre for the Arts. There
he
developed a solo guitar score for University of Calgary choreographer,
Davida
Monk's "Lyric". He has also recorded pieces for an upcoming Italian
theatrical
production of Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities".

The improvising music quartet HOWEVER brings together four players from very
diverse backgrounds and experiences: Lori Goldston, cello; Angelina Baldoz,
trumpet and flute; Jaison Scott; drums; and Torben Ulrich, text/voicing.
Ulrich
will perform vocal improvisations off of texts from his series, "Stilhedens
Cymbaler" ("Cymbals of Silence").

Founded in 2005, the Seattle-based However attempts to present a primarily
contingent and spontaneous field of sounds, attempting to ride a fragile
balance
between sound, line and pulse, readily open and receding into a silence
(which
is never quite silent).

[Bios:

Born in 1963 in New York City, Lori Goldston studied with Aaron Shapinsky
and at
Bennington College. A frequent collaborator with choreographers, filmmakers
and
musicians from other disciplines, she has performed and/or recorded with
Nirvana, David Byrne, Cat Power, and many others. She is co-founder of the
Black
Cat Orchestra and Spectratone International, which will release an album
with
Mirah on K records next year.

Born in Seattle in 1967, Angelina Baldoz has been an active
multi-instrumentalist (trumpet, flutes, electronics) in and out of the
Seattle
area and abroad, performing and creating in the improvisational music scene
as
well as the dance community and, more recently, for film. She has
collaborated
with musicians and movement artists including  Deborah Hay, Jason E
Anderson,
Linda Austin, Gust Burns, Lori Goldston, Ellen Fullman, Paul Hoskin.
Angelina
composed music for the film 'Aliens Cut My Hair' and also is an organizer
for
the Seattle Improvised Music Festival.

Born in Seattle in 1972, Jaison Scott has toured and recorded as a member of
two
additional Seattle bands: the heavy/experimental band Severhead (which has
released the CDs "Severhead" in 2001 and "Acephal" in 2002); and the
death-metal
band Sindios (which recently released the CD "Modern Plagues"). He also was
the
drummer for the heavy-rock band Murray. His current work with However opens
up
to the years he’s devoted to the study of drummers from Elvin Jones to Hamid
Drake.

Born in 1928 in Denmark, Torben Ulrich’s music background includes starting
in
the Copenhagen-based Delta Jazz Band on clarinet (being taught and scolded
by
Sidney Bechet) and later adding tenor saxophone and bass clarinet to two
bands
in his own name. He’s been writing and broadcasting over 50 years on jazz,
contemporary music and culture; recording amongst others Albert Ayler and
Sonny
Rollins for Danish Radio; and performing and recording with the Danish
avant-garde group Clinch from 2002 to 2004. ]

The future Subtext 2006 schedule is:

October 4, 2006  - Mary Burger (Bay Area) & Meg McHutchison

November 1, 2006 - Meredith Quartermain & Peter Quartermain (both Vancouver,

Dear Charles:

Joel Chace here:  poetry editor of 5_trope (online); we met
a couple of years ago when you read at Kutztown University--
had a couple of beers together, & I drove you to the actual venue.

I'm contacting you for two reasons.  First, I hope you'll consider
e-mailing me some of your recent, unpublished poetry for potential
use in a future issue of 5_trope.  Second, as a follow-up to your
note, below, regarding the "Notable Books," I wonder if you would
like me to send you one or more complimentary review copies of
a recent collection of mine from anabasis/xtant?  If so, I'll be more
than happy to provide.

I hope you are well!

Sincerely,

Joel Chace

Can anyone give me an email or phone number re: The Atlanta Poetry Group. I'm also new to the area and know no one. I've done a search for the group on the internet and nothing turns up beyond the name itself.

Hi everyone - settling into Atlanta and trying to figure out where the
poetry is - does anyone know if the Atlanta Poets Group is still
around?  Their website has been disabled and my google search hasn't
turned up much.  And any other reading series other than Poetry at
Tech?

thanks for tips! (but no tips for thanks - couldn't resist--)

I used to be APG-er when I was in Atlanta. They're still around, though
their membership has changed over the years. Try emailing James Sanders
at james-sanders@comcast.net or Randy Prunty at

Dear Lorie, Cynie, et al

Atlanta is poetry, from the traffic snarl-ups on the 75/85 interchange =
mess in mid-town early mornings to the winding serenity of the back =
streets off Paces Ferry Rd, particularly in Spring when the Dogwoods are =
in full bloom. =20

 You must not seek poetry by finding poets, that is in truth finding =
only companionship among like minded souls.  Poetry is in the place and =
in the people, all the people (with the possible exception of the =
transplants from New Jersey who think that laying on the horn of their =
vehicle will in some way alleviate traffic tie-ups). =20

Familiarize yourself with the place and develop an appreciation for =
southern life-style; that should include exposure to southern born =
natives of the greater Atlanta area. I hold dearest among my friends in =
many states and countries, those friends who were born and continue to =
live in the Atlanta area; they are poets, politicians, janitors and =
journalists...   One fellow, now 84, is a dirt farmer who has never in =
his life been further than 50 miles from his Georgia home. He plays =
fiddle badly, but does so with an energy worthy of a concert violinist.  =


You will not find his kind in places where only poets congregate. =20
And I envy you the journey you are about to undertake...

Alex,

I've spent a lot of time in Atlanta.  I've lived in the South for almost 20 years. I also know how to seek poetry which I've been doing much longer than those 20 years. By the way, never in my journey have I found a "southern lifestyle."  But thanks for your good will. Cynie

*Take your first stop on Dana Ward Day*


Garden Party
with Olive Juice Music
and Boog City

Sat. Sept. 9, 2:00 p.m., free

a summer series, in the
Suffolk Street Community Garden
Suffolk St., bet. Houston & Stanton sts.
NYC

readings from
Greg Fuchs and Dana Ward

music from
Prewar Yardsale and Nan Turner

Curated and with introductions by
Boog City editor and publisher David Kirschenbaum and
Olive Juice Music head Matt Roth

---------

**Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 15th year and
East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also published 35
volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work by Allen Ginsberg
and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme issues on baseball,
women=B9s writing, and Louisville, KY. It hosts and curates two regular
performance series--d.a. levy lives: celebrating the renegade press, where
each month a non-NYC small press and its writers and a musical act of their
choosing is hosted at Chelsea=B9s ACA Galleries; and Classic Albums Live,
where 5-13 local musical acts perform a classic album live at venues
including The Bowery Poetry Club, CBGB=B9s, and The Knitting Factory. Past
albums have included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; an=
d
Liz Phair, Exile in Guyville.

**Olive Juice Music is a D.I.Y. label, studio, and mail-order distributor
based in New York City and interested in helping people who are in the
developmental stages of trying to do something with their art. Olive Juice
Music is not a traditional record label. The artists associated with Olive
Juice take an active part in how their music is produced, financed, and
marketed. They in turn receive more of the profits gained from the sales of
their records directly, which is how it should be. The strength of Olive
Juice relies upon the active participation of its members to share resource=
s
and help promote a communal spirit among everyone involved as well as
claiming responsibility for taking their art to wherever they would like it
to go.

**Greg Fuchs is the author of Came Like It Went (Buck Downs Books;
Washington, D.C.) and Uma Ternura (Canvas and Companhia, Porto). He has wor=
k
in Thus Spake The Corpse: An Exquisite Corpse Reader 1988-1998 (Black
Sparrow Press; Santa Rosa, California). He is a member of subpress, a
collective of writers, dedicated to publishing poetry. Fuchs works as an
editor, writer, and photographer in New York.

**Prewar Yardsale says: We play a bucket and a tincan and a guitar with a
fuzzbox and a flute and a tamborine. We sing songs that we write in bed at
night after our son goes to sleep. We are part of a really cool collective
of artists on a website called olivejuice music. We play shows in New York
and once in awhile in Paris and London. We have two full albums out on
olivejuice music, called Lowdown and we are singing a sad song. We also hav=
e
a live cdr called Washington Soundboard Recording. We also have a 7" single
that was put out in England on a-ok records, with four songs on it. We are
thinking about releasing a cd with our Peel session that we did in 2003 on
the John Peel show on BBC. We love music, and we love to play shows when we
can, and we love olivejuice music.

**Nan Turner is from Washington State. Nan is a member of the 3-piece outfi=
t
known as Pantsuit. Nan discovered rock and roll on a college semester in
London supposedly studying British Political Drama. What she was really
doing was going to hear riotous grrrl bands like Linus, Huggy Bear, and
Skinned Teen, and imagining the day she would wield a guitar and sing songs=
.
When she returned to her college in New Jersey, she started a band that
eventually became Bionic Finger (1996-2001). It was during the Finger years
that Nan met Major Matt, her significant other and bandmate (see
Schwervon!). She started playing solo after Bionic Finger ended, writing
songs on guitar, keys, and drums. Nan has released one solo ep to date,
entitled Leg Out. Christine "Sharky" Murray (former Finger and also a membe=
r
of Pantsuit) plays bass on it and Sam from The Leader plays drums. Nan is
currently working on a new batch of solo songs. Her hobbies include feeding
Gummo, making mixed tapes, and knitting. She is a Virgo.

**Dana Ward is the author of New Couriers (Dusie, 2006), Standards
(Sea.Lamb.Press, 2004) and I Didn=B9t Build This Machine (Boog Literature,
2004). Recent work is out in Mirage #4/Periodical, Wherever We Put Our Hats=
,
New College Review, and elsewhere. He lives in Cincinnati and edits Cy
Press.

I moved to Atlanta a year ago, or rather unfortunately to the suburb  (like Cynie, except she lives north and I live South of Atlanta).   This makes things a bit more complicated, but still I found a few poets  who were all very welcoming.

  My contacts at the Atlanta Poets Group:
    John Lowther  at j.lo@earthlink.net
  Mark Prejsnar at m.prejsnar@worldnet.att.net

  And Bruce Covey at bcovey@emory.edu. He  runs a great poetry  series at Emory.  Actually I'm reading there on September 21st with  Kirsten Kaschock.

   I teach creative writing at Clayton  State University (Southern Crescent of Atlanta) and started a reading  series (fiction, nonfiction, poetry). Each event is followed by a  Q&A session and, well, book signing.  Actually, Cynie was a guest  last fall.

  I have invited only one poet this semester (I teach  fiction this semester), but I have booked poets exclusively for the  spring  semester (I will teach poetry then).  Below is the  schedule.   I had attached a poster announcing the fall  events, but it was refused. . . .

Hey Brigitte and Cynie (and other poets in the ATL). Not exactly in Atlanta
but close--Berry College in Rome, GA. Also new to the area with my ear to
the ground. Any other news/information about poets 'round here is welcome.
Sounds like there are enough of us to form our own group.

Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Whitewall of Sound is pleased to announce issue number 35- “Northwest
Concrete & Visual Poetry,” guest-edited by Seattle poet Nico Vassilakis.

This is- as far as we know- the first collection of poetry from the
Northwestern US and Canada on cd. This issue features work by David Abel,
Randy Adams, Jim Andrews, Jonathan Ball, derek beaulieu, Nancy Burr, Jason
Christie, Jim Clinefelter, John Crouse, Kevin McPhereson Eckhoff, Brad Ford,
David Francis, Crag Hill, Lionel Kearns, Joseph Keppler, Paul Lambert,
Donato Mancini, Bryant Mason, F.A. Nettelbeck, mARK oWEns, ross priddle,
Lanny Quarles, Thomas Lowe Taylor, Nico Vassilakis, and Ted Warnell. Also
included are two videos- “the wizard uv time” by bill bissett and
“Lengua(je” by mARK oWEns & Maria Jose Gonzales.

Copies will be available at Printed Matter (NYC) and at selected bookstores
in the
USA and Canda =or= order directly from us at Whitewall of Sound  411 NE 22nd
#21  Portland, OR  97232. Copies are $15.00 (post paid); make your check or
money order payable to Jim Clinefelter.

Whitewall of Sound has been published since 1983. The title is a reference
to the music scene and industry that once rolled out of the editor Jim
Clinefelter’s hometown of Akron, Ohio. Over the years, we have published
many of the leading artists and writers in the international visual
arts/poetry scene. We are one of the longest-running independent,
self-financed magazines in the USA- we accept no advertising and deal
directly with bookstores and our readers. We’re in this for the long haul-
all aboard!

Yeah I also noted a fascist drumbeat in that background, an
intolerant little voice that said, "Brothers and sisters,
it's okay to be different--as long as we all do it together!"

Cindy, Brigitte, Cynie and all - thanks so much for this information
on Atlanta and the warm welcome!  I'm looking forward to meeting you
all at an event soon - and by the way, I just got back from A Cappella
books on Moreland - I had the most fun in there that I've had in a
used bookstore in a long time - I picked up a first edition of
Ashbery/Schuyler's A Nest of Ninnies, Michael Palmer's Selected Poems,
and Norma Cole's Metamorphopsia - all for just $35!

I'd be nice if someone (me?) could put together a website specifically
to pool together all the Atlanta poetry groups and readings w/contact
info etc.

- Lori

Every group will have it's poseurs and dilletantes, left wing politics and avant garde poetry being no exception.

the thing about poseurs and dilletantes is that they are more concerned with being perceived as a member of some group rather than being interested in furthering the goals of that group. Hence there are tendencies towards fascistic group-think even among groups that exist specifically in opposition to such dangerous institutions. totalitarianism is an extreme of human social formation that can occur in any group following any set of principles or foundational rules. Which is how you get your Weather Underground's, your Baader-Meinhof Factions, and pretty much 90% of everything ever done in any art form.

I enjoyed Eric's piece a lot... reminded me of the one time I could have
seen Ginsberg read (at the B&N on Shattuck Ave., Berkeley), in 1995 --
instead I opted for Jane Eaglen singing Brunnhilde at the SF Opera...=20

I still kick myself for my choice, though maybe seeing Ginsberg in that
venue would have made it a less treasured memory than the wistful vacuum
of not having seen him...

to the best of my knowledge, that Supermarket in CA (on University) is
well and truly gone -- though I always thought the Andronico's about
halfway between Shattuck and San Pablo would serve as a surrogate...

A tale of two crises
Lebanon rebuilds, New Orleans waits
By Joyce Chediac
Published Aug 23, 2006 11:21 PM

In the Middle East, after a month of Israeli bombing, the people of
Lebanon are digging themselves out from the rubble and struggling to
return to their homes. In the United States, a full year after Hurricane
Katrina, the people of New Orleans are still fighting to do the same
thing: return home.

It might seem odd to compare the two. After all, Lebanon is recovering
from war, and New Orleans from a natural disaster and broken levees. But
this is only the superficial story. A look at the New Orleans relief
effort and its aftermath shows that poor people’s right to return home
has become just as much a battle there as it is in Lebanon.

In the United States, the New Orleans relief effort was spearheaded by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington’s disaster relief
arm. In Lebanon it is being organized by Hezbollah, the grassroots
Lebanese resistance movement that George W. Bush calls “terrorist.”

Which group would you want conducting a rescue effort if you lost your
home? Let us see how the relief efforts compare.

The rescues

In New Orleans, the people who could not self-evacuate the city,
including the sick and people too poor to afford cars, were left to
their own devices when the waters rose. Many of the most vulnerable
drowned in their homes.

The tens of thousands of old, sick and infirm people who the city
encouraged to gather in the Superdome until the storm passed were left
there for five days. They had no medical attention, no sanitation,
little water and food. Many died. Some 3,000 other flood survivors
stranded at the Convention Center suffered the same fate.

All day the television networks showed footage of people stranded on
roofs waving hand-made “help me” signs, and others in the Superdome
begging for water and medicine for dying seniors. Yet FEMA head Michael
Brown said he didn’t realize the extent of the crisis until four days
after the levees collapsed. Then he took another four days to rescue the
survivors.

In Lebanon, Hezbollah, the force fighting and defending the villages, at
the same time started helping the population as soon as the Israeli
bombing began. The Leba nese resistance provided the ambulances and
scores of searchers who pulled people from the rubble. They helped
organize getting tens of thousands of refugees to schools, public parks
and private homes. (Christian Science Monitor, Aug. 16)

In Beirut alone, Hezbollah organized 10 mobile medical teams that cared
for 14 schools each, in two-day rotations, helping 48,000 people.
Another 70,000 were treated in houses by other professionals.

In a Hezbollah kitchen near downtown Beirut, volunteers prepared 8,000
hot meals a day—part of a daily total of 50,000 they distributed across
Beirut, reported the Monitor.

In New Orleans, families evacuated from the Superdome and the Convention
Center were scattered all over the country. Parents were sometimes
separated from children. Some didn’t know if loved ones lived or died.
Three months after Katrina hit, 6,500 people were still unaccounted for,
and more than 400 bodies still unidentified, according to the National
Center for Missing Adults.

In Lebanon, within 24 hours of the Aug. 14 cease-fire, Hezbollah had set
up a hotline to help refugees, and so refugees could connect based on
their place of residence, according to Lebanese TV. (www.foreignpolicy.com)

In the Superdome, bodies remained for four or five days in 100-degree
heat. Relatives standing vigil were forced to abandon the remains during
the evacuation, sometimes at gunpoint. Bodies were left in flood waters,
many to be discovered by loved ones returning home months later.
Evacuees who had lost everything could not afford to bury their dead
with dignity. Grieving relatives sent to different states could offer
each other little comfort.

After the cease-fire in Lebanon, finding and burying the dead with
dignity became a priority. The resistance immediately began digging out
bodies buried in the rubble and identifying them. Remains were held for
burial until the family returned. Mass funerals were held, paid for by
the resistance, so neighbors could comfort each other and lean on the
communities’ strength. On Aug. 18, a caravan of cars made its way from
one service to the next. Said Shiite cleric Sheik Shoue Qatoon, “It was
decided that we would schedule the funerals so that we could all attend
them all.” (AP, Aug. 19)

Scattered in hotels around the country, without jobs or sources of
income, New Orleans refugees were offered by Washing ton a maximum of
$2,000 per family to live on. That was enough for a hotel room for two
weeks. Even then, the media launched a racist campaign claiming to
expose “cheaters” who were “misusing” the tiny sum. In December, New
Orleans’ displaced people were given 15 days to leave hotels, with no
further provisions made for them.

The right to return

On Aug. 14, Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah said he would give
money for “decent and suitable furniture” and a year’s rent to any
Lebanese who lost a home in the war. Beginning in the very poorest
community of Dehiya south of Beirut, the resistance is distributing
$12,000 per family, a huge sum in Lebanon where monthly rents average
$300. (New York Times, Aug 16)

A year later after the New Orleans flood, “thousands of people are
living amid ruins that stretch for miles on end. ... All you see is
debris, debris, debris. ... The reminders of death are everywhere.”(New
York Times, June 21)

Little to nothing has been done to rebuild the Ninth Ward. This majority
African-American community is filled with rubble, coated with mud and
mold. Advocates point out that much damage, such as advancing mold,
could have been stopped if the area had been cleaned early on. Many
residents would have gladly organized their own cleaning brigade, but
they were banned entry for the first four months after the flood.

In Lebanon, on Aug 14, the very day of the cease-fire, while Israel was
withdrawing its troops from Southern Lebanon, there were reports that
hundreds of Hez bollah members spread over dozens of villages across
southern Lebanon began cleaning, organizing and surveying the damage.
Men on bulldozers were busy cutting lanes through giant piles of rubble.
Roads blocked with the remnants of buildings were, just a day after a
cease-fire began, fully passable.

The actions of both the Bush administration and key corporations
indicate a determination to stop the African-Americans of New Orleans
from returning to their communities.

In September, the home insurance giant Allstate refused to reimburse New
Orleans homeowners who had flood insurance policies.The company claimed
the homes were destroyed by the wind, not by flood. (MarketWatch, Sept.
20, 2005)

In October, the Bush administration reneged on its promised to provide
thousands of mobile homes as temporary housing for returning refugees.
(New York Times, Oct. 31, 2005)

After promising New Orleans federal housing loans to repair and rebuild,
it became apparent that no special loan provisions had been made for
victims of the flood and that the White House was pushing for hurricane
disaster-recovery loans at a higher rate than any other administration
in the last 15 years. (USA Today, March15)

Regarding public housing, in a thinly veiled racist attack, Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson said in April that only the
“best residents” should be allowed to return to public housing. (USA
Today, April 25) And in June HUD, which had previously reported that it
had 7,381 public apartments in New Orleans, now said it had only 2,000,
and would demolish the rest.

Meanwhile in Lebanon, a Hezbollah spokes person announced, “We have full
information on all the buildings that have been destroyed or damaged. …
“we will either pay for new flats or rebuild the buildings that were
destroyed.” (Aljazzera.net, Aug. 19)

Representatives of Jihad al-Binaa, Hezbollah’s construction arm, are
touring the south to assess the damage and start repairing and
rebuilding. (Beirut Daily Star Aug. 22)

And what of those who could not wait, but have returned home in the
devastated areas of the south before essential repairs have been made
and services restored?

“There are people from Hezbollah coming regularly to check on us and
give us bread and other basic items,” said Mohammad Bazih, 30, from the
village of Baakline. Residents of Zabqine, where tobacco is cultivated,
told the press that Hezbollah was providing them with basic services.

'Flat Daddies' deploy to help Maine military families

By Bangor Daily News Staff

Tuesday, August 29, 2006 - Bangor Daily News << Back

By Jackie Farwell
Bangor Daily News

Mary Holbrook's husband, Lt. Col. Randall Holbrook,
goes everywhere with his family - to the grocery
store, out to eat, camping, and even to Mary's most
recent gynecologist appointment. The doting Hermon
family man just waits and grins as Mary and their two
sons, Justin, 14, and Logan, 5, go about their days.

He doesn't say much, and he doesn't have any legs.
That's because the ever-present Randall is actually a
life-sized, foam board likeness of the real Randall
from the waist up. He's a " Flat Daddy," one of many
two-dimensional service members created through a
National Guard program designed to ease the pain of
separation for families of deployed troops.

"It's comforting," Mary Holbrook said. "It did help me
adjust a lot."

The Flat Daddy - and Flat Mommy - effort geared up in
Maine at the beginning of the year with the January
deployment of the Brewer-based B Company, 3rd
Battalion of the 172nd Mountain Infantry. The Guard
pays to have a photo of the troop member blown up and
provides supplies to families to attach the photo to
foam board.

The cutouts also are provided to parents and family
members of childless service members.

Spearheaded by Barbara Claudel, coordinator of the
Maine National Guard's family program in Augusta, the
endeavor has since provided more than 100 cutouts to
service members' families.

Randall Holbrook's family made his Flat Daddy likeness
when he deployed to Afghanistan in January with the
Maine Army Guard's 240th Engineer Group of Augusta. He
is scheduled to be gone until April, his wife said
Wednesday evening in the driveway of her Hermon
farmhouse.

"Where do you want to take Flat Daddy, Logan?"
Holbrook asked her son.

"To the movie theater," Logan replied, briefly
breaking from crawling on the family sedan.

That's one of the few places Flat Daddy hasn't
visited, already having been toted to birthday
parties, ballgames, school, the hairdresser, the
babysitter's with Logan, and to the funeral of Mary
Holbrook's mother. Justin dressed him in a Red Sox
jersey and hat and watched a baseball game with Flat
Daddy, he said.

People sometimes give her funny looks when she takes
Flat Daddy out in public, but many tell her they think
it's a great idea, Mary Holbrook said.

"Any time I get invited somewhere, I take it with me,"
she said.

And the gynecologist?

"He just thought it was really neat," she said.

The cutout is so realistic that it gave her a scare
when she returned to her car one day, having forgotten
that she'd belted him into a seat, Mary Holbrook said.


One place Flat Daddy doesn't go is her bed. The Guard
wife doesn't take it that far, she said bashfully.

Not that the Holbrooks don't have a little fun with
Flat Daddy, which the real daddy might not tolerate.
On Halloween, they dressed him up in a sumo wrestler
costume. When the family first got him, they propped
him up in a chair at dinnertime.

"We put plates in front of him the first few days,"
Mary Holbrook said. "But he didn't eat much."

The idea that a foam board cutout could alleviate the
pain of a loved one's absence seems a little silly at
first, but somehow it helps, Mary Holbrook said.

"It makes you feel like he's right there," she said,
as Flat Daddy rested in a nearby lawn chair.

Sherri Fish of Bangor thought the head-to-toe Flat
Daddy likeness of her husband, Maine Air National
Guard Staff Sgt. Richard Fish, was a little foolish at
first.

She put it up on the door in her son Kevin's room, who
was 3 years old when her husband deployed to Iraq in
March 2005. Kevin didn't understand why his father had
to leave and was so deeply angry that he wouldn't
speak to Richard when he called home from Tikrit,
Sherri Fish said.

"It was really hard on him," she said. "It was
probably the hardest thing I had to go through while
Rich was gone."

Then Sherri began hearing Kevin talking while alone in
his room.

"One night, I finally asked him, 'Who are you talking
to?' And he said, 'I'm talking to Daddy," Fish said.
"I just about broke down crying."

"He'd sit at the end of his bed and tell him what went
on at school that day," she said.

Despite his anger at his father, Kevin somehow felt
comfortable relating to the life-sized likeness,
Sherri Fish said. She admits it helped her, too.

"I'd catch myself just standing in Kevin's room, just
looking at the picture," she said.

Kevin continued talking to Flat Daddy after Richard
Fish returned home in October 2005, chatting with the
cutout while his father was working in the morning,
Sherri Fish said.

It's funny how a piece of foam board can ease a
child's pain so much, "even though it's just a
picture," she said.

CONCRETE STIR FRY POEMS
by Marko Niemi
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts/marko

Marko Niemi (Finland) has written five "Concrete Stir Fry Poems" that extend
the notion of the stir fry form into graphics. Of letters. He has also
re-written the programming of the stir fry form in these concrete works.
These five works play on relationship, statsis, and dynamism/transformation.
For instance, "still-life" consists of the letters in the word LIFE
discombobulatable into parts of each other via moving the mouse over the
piece. "four musicians" consists of the letters in the word ECHO. These
pieces are quite "concrete" in the Noigandrean sense concerning their
simplicity and iconic nature; but they are also contemporary in their
algorithmic, generative construction as things written out of programming
code and graphics of letters. Marko's work, then, both extends the
algorithmic exploration of language and other media implicit in the stir fry
form and explores its relations with the earlier work of the concrete poets.

The 'Stir Fry Texts' project began in 1999 (
http://vispo.com/StirFryTexts ). Since then, Pauline Masurel and Brian
Lennon have written stir frys, and Shuen-shing Lee has translated one into
Chinese. It is an ongoing project, apparently.

The stir fry is basically a form (like a sonnett is a form) that can contain
any sort of content that can be put in a web page (text, image, object,
sound, etc). The content consists of n texts (and/or images, objects, etc),
each of which is cut up into m pieces. When the wreader mouses over the mth
part of the jth thang, it is replaced with the mth part of the (j+1)th
thang. The piece retains its continuity, resulting sometimes in a defensive
twitching that resists perfect control by the wreader; the behavior has been
likened to a hedgehog if you try to touch its belly. Sadly, I cannot confirm
this, not having ever touched a hedgehog's belly. The interface also
provides controls to view each of the n thangs in their entirety, without
discombobulation.

In addition to writing the "Concrete Stir Fry Poems", Marko, in 2004, also
helped update the programming. I wrote the DHTML code in 1999, when
cross-browser/cross-platform DHTML was very hard to achieve, particularly
given that the stir fry keyed on the innerHTML DHTML method, which had not
been implemented at all in some browsers. Marko helped me update the
programming so that the stir frys now work on most browsers and platforms. I
see his new work in the "Concrete Stir Fry Poems" does not use the innerHTML
method at all and is compactly described in a small .js file.

This takes the "Jesus tortilla" to a whole 'nother level.
What if the kids prefer Flat Daddy when Randall comes home?
Does Randall have a Flat Mommy? What would Mary say to that?
Would he introduce FM to the kids as "Aunt Flattie"?
