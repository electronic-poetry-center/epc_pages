        I don't really mean communication in the sense of meaning or
conveying a message as much as I mean a point of contact.  It seems to
me that doing readings or circulating my works is a connection, it starts
a relationship.  There is a reception of something that was once
internal, a thought.  It still may be abstract and without function, but it
has touched someone else's life once it has left my fingers or my mouth.
If poetry was merely noise for myself I could just leave it in my head.
But I need the contact, the communion with someone else.  They don't have
to like it, or understand it, just read or hear it.  After that it's too
late to go back I've already invaded, they are no longer innocent of me.

Subject:      AWOL: correction to September Happenings

It has just been brought to my attention that the Tasmanian Writers Union
meeting which was listed as taking place on Wednesday 4th September is
really taking place on Wednesday 4th October.

The corrected entry should read:

Wednesday 4th October there'll be a Tasmanian Writers' Union (TWU)
reading at the Bavarian Tavern 28 Liverpool Street Hobart at 7.30 pm.
featuring three of the readers from the Tasmanian Poetry Festival: Matt
Simpson (U.K.), Jenny Boult and Chris Mansell. Cost $8/$5 conc. Details
phone TWU (002) 240029.


Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused ( I hope nobody has to
change their travel plans).

Ok I did some research on limericks so I could get it right this time.
Anybody familiar with Edward Lear and the Book of Nonsense?

Here's a sample,

There once was an Old man of Marseilles
Whose daughters wore bottles green veils
The caught several fish, which they put in dish
And sent to their Pa in Marseilles.

there once was a Young Lady of Welling
Whose praise all the world was a telling
She played on the harp, and caught several carp,
The accomplished Young Lady of Welling.

Now would someone explian why you need fish to complete the verse?

Waterstone's Bookstore.  It didn't actually burst into flames (just being
dramatic), actually the restaurant below it, or beside it, did, and the
bookstore suffered tremendous water, smoke and structural damage.  A friend who
works there has heard that they will probably be closed for some months.

I'd bet that few of these same Americans have more than glanced at Jabes,

Dear List Subscibers,

If you have already seen a version of the following, then please ignore
or forgive this notice, being sent now that all good academics are
back at their desks, ready for the fall term to get underway:

I am searching for people to review my forthcoming book: THE POETICS OF
AUTHORSHIP IN THE LATER MIDDLE AGES: THE EMERGENCE OF THE MODERN
LITERARY PERSONA (Peter Lang, due out this winter).  The book discusses
what I call the authorship trope and its deepest implications within
the world of literature but also within the sphere of what the history
of ideas.  The book places literary "signing" within its wider milieux;
I have things to say about Augustine, Anselm, Abelard, Aquinas and Ockham among
others.  The book contains extensive close readings of Guillem IX, Marcabru,
Dante, Langland and Chaucer.

The book's argument is that literary individualism first widely manifests in
the early twelfth-century as word puzzles and overt self-naming, but also more
broadly and deeply in discussions about the nature of writing and the role
of the poet in the world.  These five poets are typical of their era: they are
poets, AND they are intellectuals.  My study traces their literary claims
of authorship to their interests in contemporaneous philosophical debtates--not
to the need for what modernity views as self-promotion.  Nevertheless, in their
creations of both history and fiction, these poets anticipated modern narrative
and its literary persona, as they contributed to the emergence of the modern,
autonomous self.


If you would like more information about this book, for the purposes of reviewing it or otherwise, please contact me.

I'm curous if any of you out here know of any or many
poems related to or influenced by children's literature.
I'm not talking about children's verse either.  I think
bp did something (I know he had a lot of pop up books and,
if I remember correctly, he worked on the Fraggle Rock genius);
Dennis Lee might be another.  In particular, I'm interested
in the influence of fairy tales on contemporary poetry
and poetics.

ONe of the things I've been thinking about is how the supernatural
occurs.  In many tales, the supernatural offers an occasion to
a character to demonstrate (hence, "monster") their unrecognized virtue
(Hansel and Gretel and the Witch, for instance--she allows them to
prove to their stupid parents that they're pretty good kids after
all).  In this respect, the supernatural functions like a language,
or the acquistion of a language which is recognized by the ruling
community or persons (H and G TELL their parents over and over that
they don't want to go, that they want to stay, etc...but it takes
their actions against the witch before anyone listens).  Monsters
as demonstrative language? Speech as supernatural, an initiation into
a discursive community?

Kids get all the hard stuff to read.

Anyways, with this in mind, I would like to know of any poems or
poets that deal with fairy tale lore in, not necessrily this manner,
but work with the material.

Thanksillions,

Ryan Knighton

PS I have a really crappy joke I want to tell but it doesn't work
on a page so you'll just have to come to Vancouver sometime to hear it.

Not guilty.

I compared you to Ross Perot.

Fliply and with no elucidation.

But if anybody asked (and Kevin Killian did), I would have said that
what I meant was that, like Ross' use of aphorisms, the stance behind
"All Acts are Simply Acts" and especially the intro on poetry &
politics seems like common sense on the surface but is actually very
willfully (to the point of being coy) wrong.

It carries Williams' dictum about no ideas but in things to an extreme,
which could be pure thingness but also simply "no ideas"

But since you've declared WCW to be "boring" that must not be it either

All best,
Ron

The movie was actually quite well-done, only none of the "actors" could act.
The kids were great.  The Tibetan Buddhist monks who played Tibetan Buddhist
monks were also great.  Bridget Fonda did well, but didn't have a very big
role.  Which pretty much leaves Keanu and Chris Isaak.  I kept expecting the
Buddha's enlightenment to be expressed like, "Whoaaaa, dude!"  It was a
little distracting.

Ryan,

Card catalogue here has _Disenchantments: an Anthology of Modern
Fairy Tale Poetry,_ ed. Wolfgang Mieder, University Press of
New England 1985.  Don't know if it contains any interesting work.

From _My Book House_ (1920)--worth it for the last two lines:

THE ASSEMBLING OF THE FAYS

They come from beds of lichen green,
They creep from the mullein's velvet screen;
   Some on the backs of beetles fly
From the silver tops of moon-touched trees,
Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high,
And rocked about in the evening breeze;
And now they throng the moonlight glade,
Above--below--on every side,
Their little minim forms arrayed,
In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride.

-- Rachel

As a new subscriber (introduced by friends Pierre Joris and Rod Smith), I
came late to this thread, but have never understood why Jabes has not
been read more widely here.  Toward that end, I'm teaching an over-
subscribed seminar this semester on -The Book of Questions-, and,
fortuitously, Rosmarie Waldrop will join us one week for discussion.
Does anyone have ideas about why Americans have so ignored or resisted
Jabes?

Thank you all creating a list of such intelligence. . .

I am pleased to announce that shortly before midnight last night the
move to the new Electronic Poetry Center url was made operative.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The EPC's new URL is:

http://writing.upenn.edu/epc

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Please re-set your bookmarks!

Also, keep in mind that for the next couple of days I will continue to
debug the new URL. A number of changes had to be made to accommodate
new features and quicker links, so it took significant rebuilding of
the files to accomplish this. You will find occasional link failures
but this is being worked on assiduously. (The author libraries, for
example, are still being rebuilt but I hope to complete these very
soon.)

Thanks for your patience and I look forward to seeing you at our new
url!

To the contrary, one of my complains in recent years is that Jabes is
about the only contemporary French "poet" (what do we call that kind of
work?) known to many academics outside of French departments -- I assume
that somebdoy is purchasing all those copies of his works that are sold
at university book stores (& now even Borders!) --

thanks again to Rosmarie Waldrop and Wesleyan for making those beautiful
English translations available

But wouldn't it be nice if Jacques Roubaud or Anne-Marie Albiach were as
widely known?

I've yet to encounter an academic (outside French) who has read
Jabes, and I urge whatever so-called "mainstream" poets I encounter
to read him.  My students know Roubaud and Albiach.  It's sad that
there are several excellent Roubaud translations circulating without
a publisher.

        One of the reasons -- I think -- that Jabes' name is better
known than his work might have to do with the fact that many young
students/poets meet up with _the name_ Jabes in the writings of
Derrida, Blanchot & others, rather than pulling a book off the shelves
in the poetry section of a bookstore.
        Beyond that there may also be the question of a range of
people used to certain american poetries might find the work too
fordidding in its "esoteric" (Jewish/cabbalistic etc.) & "spiritual"
dimensions. It is work of a piece & it does take some energy & desire
to move towards it.
        As to some of the other recations to your query: Sure, it
would be excellent if Roubaud & Albiach were better known -- but they
are known -- or they wouldn't be mentioned here! I could rattle off a
dozen names (not published by P.O.L.)  whose work is as worthwhile &
_should_ be known (not even "better" -- just known) in this country.

Aldon, Carolyn, Herb and all others,

Why have americans so ignored or resisted Jabes?  Because it is a
poetry of ideas and it's structurally innovative.  Each of these
traits alone is enough to unnerve most U.S. readers.  Why was
Zukofsky ignored and resisted for so long?  As Aldon pointed out,
contemporary american poets who are similarly intriguing and
challenging are equally ignored.  I think U.S. readers are
taught that if a work makes demands on them it's seriously
flawed because the poet should have made it more user-friendly.

Aldon,

Yes it would be nice if Jacques Roubaud or Anne-Albiach were as well
known as Jabes.  Emmanuel Hocquard, as well.  I highly recommend
Michael Palmer's translation of Hocquard's TABLE OF THEORIES.  For
that matter, I highly recommend Tom Mandel's LETTERS OF THE LAW
which seems to have been ignored when it came out in January except
by those who didn't like it because it's unlike some earlier work.

Still Jabes is hardly a household word, though Roubaud, Anne-Marie
Albiach and Hocquard seem to be unknown ever within French Depts.

Carolyn,

I delighted that your students are familiar with Roubaud and Albiach.
I'd be interested in hearing more, back channel, about the unpublished
Roubaud translations.  Frankly, the only people I know who have
actually read Albiach or Jabes have been other poets.  I've yet to
encounter an academic familiar with their work. Roubaud seems more
widely but as a writer of fiction instead of poetry.  Glad you're
doing a seminar on BOOK OF QUESTIONS.  All of these writers deserve
a broader readership here in the states.

I am surprised to hear all the talk of Jabes's lack of readers. I was
led to believe that everyone but I has read him. I have some of gis
books, but I have not read much. But now everyone but I has read
Bhabba or however you spell his name.

Re use of kid lit--
The piece of mine called "XCII (cinder-cifter)" in _oblek 12_
uses a 1932 edition of Mother Goose for half of it's vocabulary.
The form is Pound's Canto of same #. & the other half of the vocabulary comes
from a character by character transliteration of the _Tao Te Ching_. Lines
flush left source Goose, lines indented source Tao. Also, I've done a writing
through _Fun with Dick & Jane_ called "See it Go," which is part of a
"circus" based on Cage's _Roaratorio_, uses broken toy sound effects among
other things. A favorite of mine is David Shapiro's "The Boss Poem" written
with his son Daniel.

Good question.

I can think of two reasons, at least. One is that Americans as an
audience (this is the grossest overgeneralization, I realize) have
tended to love a poetics of the noun (Whitman, Williams, Olson,
Creeley, Ginsberg, Crane, O'Hara, etc.). The counter examples that do
exist (Stevens, Ashbery, Duncan and Eliot come to mind) all produced a
metaphysical discourse, but one that seemed (important qualifier there)
to shy away from a spiritual discourse. Duncan's spirituality was so
19th century as to be a museum of itself. Eliot's catholicism came
after he had made his inroad on the public mind.

A second is that the French prose poem as it has come to America via
its main proselytizers, Bly, Benedikt, Edson, et al, veers away from
longer works and works that really transcend the "prose lyric" posed by
Jacob as a closed form. Thus Segalen, St. John Perse, the Ponge of the
pine woods have all been marginalized.

A third is that he's Jewish. One look at the fate of the Objectivists
ought to tell us what that means in America.

All best,

Carolyn, Jonathan, & others --

I have generally quoted a lot of Jabes's comments on "the book" in talks
I've given over the last four years or so on the book arts. People in that
field as well as more "poetics"-involved groups I've spoken to about
such matters seem surprised that I would make a more or less direct
connection between such theoretical/spiritual discussion of the book and
the book as physical object. Such a connection seemed immediate to me on
reading Jabes's work. It still does. The book arts community is certainly
not familiar with Jabes, although I've loaned my books to many people in
the field, and he is taken up with some enthusiasm among those who attempt
to construct a conceptual framework for their activities in bookmaking. Now
if I could get them to read Albiach and Roubaud and Hocquard and Fourcade
and Royet-Journoud, there might be some fascinating trans-Atlantic book
projects.

I actually knew a woman at Sonoma State when I was there who was a Millay
expert.  She had been accepted to Vancouver to do a doctorate last time I
heard from her but wasn't sure whether to go.  Her name is Jennifer,
damn, can't remember her last name.  I'll look and see if I can find it.
She did wonderful readings of Millay in which she dressed up and

Actually, Ryan, when I mentioned Atwood I was also thinking of her
verse. She has always declared fairy tales her main source, and as
you might know, she did her harvard thjesis on late 19th C horror
writers like Rider haggard. She was also a sucker for Hollywood
monster movies. Check thru her poetry: you will find lots of traces
from fairy tales.

You might have a look at Kenward Elmslie, too. See how fairy tales
mesh with Jean harlow and the Old Dutch lady, etc.

Thought ye all might be interested in this.  Gab.


The Saginaw, Michigan, store of Media Play, Inc., at the direction of
their national corporate headquarters (Media Play and parent corporation
Musicland, located in Minnesota) are exploting local writers, artists and
musicians for public relations purposes while refusing to carry some of
their works on the shelves, even on consignment.  Media Play has over 50
stores nationwide, including 14 in Michigan and one in Buffalo, NY.

The Saginaw store has censored my own books and the books published by my
small press, Mayapple Press, written by other authors.  The awards
mentioned in the letter below are Great Lakes Colleges Association New
Writers Award, which gave Honorable Mention to my book of prose-poetry,
*Mothering* in 1978, and the Science Fiction Poetry Association's Rhysling
Award for Best Long Poem, given to "Pilot, Pilot" in 1995.  This poem is
included in *Blues for Port City* by David Lunde.  Both these books were
in a group of 6 refused for consignment by the Saginaw, Michigan, outlet
of Media Play, Inc.

                **EXPLOITATION AND CENSORSHIP!**

                                   September 1, 1995

To the Editor:

Within the last two weeks, it has come to our attention that Media Play,
Inc. and its parent company Musicland Corporation, are censoring the works
of American poets and writers by refusing to carry them in their stores
even on consignment, based on the supposed "sensitivity" of the material.
Works refused by the Media Play store in Saginaw, Michigan, include two
which were recognized in part or whole as meritorious in mainstream
national literary competitions.  The store management declares that in
doing this, they are following corporate policy dictated by the national
corporate headquarters and its Board.

According to the Detroit Free Press, it is national Media Play corporate
policy to target areas with highly-educated populations for their new
stores, because people who are highly educated read books.  People who
read books also buy CD's, videotapes, computer software and collectibles
which the stores carry.  In order to bring these people into the store for
extended periods of time, all Media Play stores have been directed by
their corporate headquarters to solicit writers, poets, artists and
musicians from the immediate area to participate in public relations
events such as performances, readings, book signings and exhibits.  Such
people are also likely to become good customers.

However, the Saginaw store that was willing to host a writer for a reading
is not willing to sell that same writer's books on the shelves even on
consignment, based on the store management's and the corporate public
relations staff's fears that the content might be found offensive.  In
addition, the Saginaw store has pulled items from the shelves sent to them
by the corporate buyers, without ever receiving a complaint, thereby
making themselves moral arbiters for adult readers in the tri-county
region, the same "highly-educated readers" they wish to attract.

We the undersigned will not spend money in any Media Play store until this
policy has been changed, nor will we cooperate with their public relations
efforts.  We urge all those who value freedom of expression to boycott all
stores run by Media Play or Musicland Corporation, their parent company.
Please let store managers know that you are boycotting them, and why you
are doing so.  Please decline invitations to give readings, concerts, art
exhibits, book signings, or in other ways contribute to the public
relations efforts of Media Play, Inc., or their parent company Musicland
Corporation.  We also encourage small press publishers to test the
situation at their local Media Play outlets by bringing in publications
for possible consignment.

Okay. Here I go a-rattling off in the random order of alpabetic
precedence a baker's dozen French poets:  Jean-Christophe Bailly,
Matthieu Benezet,Yves Buin,  Michel Bulteau, Michel Deguy, Jacques
Dupin, Jean-Pierre Duprey, Genevieve Clancy, Gerard de Cortanze,
Jean-Pierre Faye, Liliane Giraudon, Leslie Kaplan, Matthieu Messagier,
Alain Jouffroy, Bernard Noel, Michel Maire, Claude Pelieu,  Denis
Roche, Maurice Roche, James Sacre, Eric Sarner, Serge Sautreau, Frank
Venaille, Marcelin Pleynet,  Jacqueline Risset, Alain Veinstein, Andre
Velter, Jean-Pierre Verheggen,

hmm, I think I got more than a dozen already, so let me now switch to
a quick list of poets who write in French but are from south of "la
metropole" as they used to say: Mohammed Dib, Tahar Djaout, Mohammed
Khair-Eddine, Abdelwaheb Meddeb, Abdelkebir Khatibi, Ahmed Kedidi,
Amina Said,Habib Tengour, Kateb Yacine...

Dear Pierre,
        To your wonderful list I would add Jean-Jacques Viton and
Joseph Guglielmi.  Are the poets from "south of the metropole"
available in translation?  For a sampling of the others, I can
only suggested Serge Garonsky's already well known -Toward a New Poetics-
(University of California Press, 1994).

Subject:      Re: Jabes

Since Pierre and I have been mulling over the names & works of many in our
attempt to compose a global anthology, etc., shouldn't we mention his own
recent attempts to translate the very powerful Congolese poet Tchicaya
U Tam'si (died in 1988) who was also a master of the French language & its
poetries?  I think -- in terms of what we're planning to include in the
second installment of our work -- mention should also be made of poets like
Bernard Heidieck and Henri Chopin, who have been part of the most experimental
side of French poetry, along with others like Michele Metail, Pierre & Ilse
Garnier (Spatialism), Isidore Isou (Lettrisme), Julien Blaine, & so on.  The
question of what it takes to be known & read over here is itself a little
puzzling.  Jabes (who was a good friend to many of us) has a huge number of
translated works, but Roubaud (besides the fiction work) has at least two
recent (important/crucial) books of poetry -- translated (like Jabes's
works) by Rosmarie Waldrop.  Both of them -- but Jabes in particular -- are,
it seems to me, as well known as one would expect contemporary furrin poets
to be in the present U.S. climate.  But it might also be noted -- with Jabes,
say -- that there is both a reader enthusiasm & a suprising or not-so
surprising reader resistance.  I think this may have, as Silliman suggests,
some bias about the Jewish nature of the work, but more often (in my
experience of it) takes the form of people professing to feel outside his
concerns, which are taken to be much more hermetic (referential to some
presumed deep learning in kabbala & Jewish mysticism etc) than they actually
are.  But the point is that there are a considerable number of people who
may block on Jabes but who are otherwise quite aware of who he is & may
have even tried to crack him, so to speak.  (I take much of this as a measure,
by the way, of how really good he is.)

Aside to Ron on the non-acceptance of the Objectivists for being Jewish, it
seems to me that a probably more widespread block was that they were closely
tied to Pound (as anti-Jew), even so far (in the early days) as to include
him (& WCW) within the body of what was being presented in the Objectivists
Athology & the Objectivists issue of Poetry/Chicago.  I mean only that on
that level, things in the poetry world (& elsewhere) get pretty damn confusing.

And going back to the original matter of known and unknown French poets, one
should remember that a number of those mentioned by Pierre appear also in
Paul Auster's Random House Book of Twentieth-Century French Poetry -- in
addition to those in the Gavronsky book that Carolyn refers to.

Okay & greetings.

Check Duncan on "faerie" etc. for the real mccoy on these matters.  Or Yeats,
say, once you get past those celtic twilights.  Or Lorca whose duende (goblin)
is of that world as well.  Or our old friend Wakoski come to think of it.

        viz, in the case of Duncan

                                        a fairy citadel
                        a fabulous construction out of
                            Christianity where Morgan le Fay
                        carries the king to her enchanted Isle
                             (R.D., "Nel Mezzo del Cammin ...")

& with others a still darker, older world -- one of those resources now left
for children.

But that much is an old old story -- part of our poetics (to say nothing of
our poetry) since Shakespeare & Spenser at the very least.  And old, old in
this century as well.

Will anyone who knows anything about anything mentioned in the
note below (sent to Ric Caddel in the UK) please write--soon--
(Cristina_Brown@Brownvm.brown.edu) & tell me how I might best
proceed?  Feel free to say insulting things about my project as
it now stands (for instance: "uninspired" "rudimentary" "poorly-
researched" "boring" "what project?") but be sure also to offer useful
advice--names/addresses of contacts, possible angles to take, etc.  I
don't think I'll be doing work on the "relationship between
contemporary British & American poetries" per se but will use that
connection as a jumping-off point to some more specific (& less
reductive) study . . . .

Mr. Caddel:

I'm a writing student at Brown University, recently subscribed to the
POETICS list--have been working with the (Burning Deck) Waldrops
and friends on a proposal which if successful will convince the British
Fulbright & Marshall committees to have me sent over to some British
university to work on a project having to do with the relationship (?)
between contemporary British & American poetries, and which would involve
quite a bit of research on the poets featured in Longville & Crozier's A
Various Art, Mottram et al.'s The New British Poetry, Tom Raworth's
Exact Change showcase & others writing in a similar (British) vein. As
far as I can tell, there hasn't been a whole lot written on the kind of
British poetry which interests me--poetry which reflects a disaffection
for received modes of reading & writing, which does not seek primarily
to appease or to comfort--into which, in fact, is built a certain
resistance--& in which a considered and difficult relationship to (& with)
language is manifest. So far I've looked at the Hampson/Barry
collection (scope of the possible), a book of essays by A. Weatherhead,
an article by Marjorie Perloff, & very little else--not being able to find
out more (A Various Art not locally available, for instance--I came
across it in a London bookstore last summer) makes it seem all the
more important that I go to England--I've been told that Anthony
Crozier is at Sussex & John James at Cambridge, though I haven't been
able to find James' name on the Cambridge faculty lists & haven:t been
able to locate e-mail addresses for either--or in fact anyone else who
might be able to help me save yourself.  The proposal's due September
22nd--can you give me some leads, suggest a university at which a
project like mine might be welcome--or pass this note on to someone
who might be interested or willing to offer advice?  I'll post some
version of this on the list.

Thanks,

irrelevant, perhaps, but somehow seques with a joke that an alto player
made last night at the Detroit Jazz Festival: after the next tune, be
ready for a discussion of Marx in English.  I beg indulgence.

Is "duende" commonly translated as "goblin"?
As Chris Cheek reminded the list some while ago, the first English translation
of the Manifesto begins, "There is a hobgoblin"/not "A spectre haunts. . ."

What is the difference between goblin and hobgoblin?
J. Edgar's spectre might ask 'Who would you trust your children to,
Lorca's "duende" or Marx's "hobgoblin"?'--his grammar would be as bad.
He would see connections, even connecting under the bed.

But I do want to know about duende, especially in light of a nice
piece of Nathaniel Mackey's on Miles Davis's "Sketches of Spain" alongside
Lorca on duende.  Makes me laugh, at least, a happy laugh of trebled
hauntings--at least.

In addition to Garonsky's -Toward a New Poetics-, -Violence of the

This is the first time I have, I think, seen duende translated as
goblin. That is a little alarming, given that a popular brand of
toilet paper in mexico is Duende.

Have you seen the transcribed discussion among Olson, Duncan and
Ginsberg about duende during the 1963 Vancouver poetryfest. It has
been publisht a few times, most recently in Ralph Maud's Olson
Newsletter. In the discussion, curiously enough, Olson and esp.
Duncan are way off, and Ginsberg comes closest to it. He mentions, I
think I recall, Mexicans telling him the duende is what scares the
cattle at night.

There is also a discussion of duende in the third Spicer lecture
(1965) which will be published in Peter Gizzi's edition.

By the way, the toilet paper is called that not because going No. 2
is spooky in Mexico, but because a literal meaning is also "soft."

I am thinking that your best help might come from Peter Quartermain,
who is on this list, but usually lurks. He is an expert on the hipper
Brit poets, as well as being hip to what is happening in the U.S. He
goes to England often. One of the best places to work might be at U.
of Durham, where the Bunting papers are, and smart folks.
The crossover started with the UK littlelittle mags of the 60s , such
as Move and Tlaloc.

The following may be of interest to some, particularly
the rengists?
Forwrded from NARRATIVE-L

TEXT21-L on LISTSERV@BIGVAX.ALFRED.EDU   The future of the written word.

   The TEXT21-L discussion list is part of a symposium on the future of
   the written word, called Text 21, to be held at Alfred University in
   New York state.  While the symposium will take place during four
   weekends over the 1995-96 academic year, the discussion list will be
   a continual forum to discuss issues relevant to the relation between
   communication, especially written language, and technology.

   TEXT21-L is intended to discuss not only the future of text, but also
   the way new technology integrates other media, like sound, video,
   images, and virtual reality, into text, and the emerging forms of
   communication made possible by new technology.

   The relative benefits and problems of "new media" compared to "old
   media," technology and rhetoric, the future of the written word,
   Computer Mediated Communication, Human-Computer Interaction, the fate
   of the book, the relations between text and image, the future of
   communication, the philosophical implications of technology, and
   copyright issues are all relevant issues.  The tone of the list is
   intended to strike a balance between scholarly and conversational,
   but the ultimate structure of the list will be decided by the
   individual decisions of its members.

   All entries to this list will be edited, hypertextually linked, and
   released, free to the public, on the Text 21 World Wide Web page at:

      http://www.text21.alfred.edu/

   This Web page will be available on September 20, 1995.

   Each hypertext section will be referenced to its respective author,
   with a link to the author's home page, if one exists, or, if the
   author wishes, an email (mailto:) link.  Because of the nature of the
   Internet, everything submitted to the list is assumed to be in the

a note on duende
it has the following meanings in Spanish in general as a noun (i wasn't
aware that it is an adjective meaning soft in Mexican Spanish)

1. goblin
2. charm, enchantment, bewitchment

[duende comes originally from duen de casa (shortened from duen~o de
casa = `owner of the house,' in reference to a spirit that haunts a house.]

Lorca certainly did not mean 1 but rather a non-anthropomorphizable
`presence'.

I wonder if the toilet paper was named by someone who knew about Charmin'.

This is for Christina Brown.  I don't think the poetries you describe are
studied anywhere academically in the UK but your best bet would be Sussex
with Peter Nicholls.  A wonderful guy with a great interest in all the
poetries you describe, books on Modernisms and Ezra Pound and now working
on a poetry book.  At Edinburgh there's Aidan Day who shares your
interests and maybe you could study at Cambridge with Jeremy Prynne but
that might be iffy for the Marshall, etc.

Anyway, I'd put down Sussex and there are many other good people there at
the School of American Studies.
Hope it works.
Best, Marjorie Perloff

Hey, Marjorie.

Things must have changed for the better at Sussex. In 1966 I went
there and asked whether, holding a scholarship, I could work on Basil
Bunting. The English dept. told me heavens, no, because Bunting was
still alive.

By golly, my U. of Chicago dictionary gives "goblin" for duende.
In discussing the word in 1965, a Mexicano told me it meant
soft/smooth as well as the spectral stuff, in everyday talk, as an
adjective.

Maybe the Mexicano was a fantasma, maybe the same one that whispered
dondamente to Spicer.

I too go to England often, tho it's getting hard to find. I've
back-channelled to Cristina Brown with specific suggestions, but thought
it useful to come back on some points. First, a little story: When I first
arrived in Newcastle in the late '60s I showed my adolescent scribbles to
someone who said I'd obviously been reading Dorn and Duncan, who I'd never
heard of (indeed, I hadn't heard of anyone). I trotted round to Tom
Pickard's shop Ultima Thule (which I used as a library) and began to read
Dorn and Duncan, and was flattered but mystified by the comparison (still
am).

The first point is that "the message" was firmly in place by that stage,
and that objectivist and black mountain and new york poetries were
getting through - at least to that place. I later discovered that John
Seed was also grazing those shelves at the same time - we probably rubbed
shoulders by the little magazines shelves. Those little mags, including
Tlaloc, as George said, did a good job: I'd mention Grosseteste Review,
Second Aeon, and Ian Hamilton Finlay's Poor.Old.Tired.Horse. (aka POTH)
at the same time. Also, there was "the Migrant set" - Gael Turnbull,
Michael Shayer and Roy Fisher - invaluable cross-fertilizers right at the
start of the 60s.

The second point is that not all assumptions about transatlantic
"influences" are well-founded, and indeed in their reductive form they can
be unhelpful (a UK "establishment" put-down of Pig Press which still
surfaces is "publishes American and American-influenced poets" - as if
american influence were some kind of virus!): what's more helpful, I'd
have thought, wd be to identifiy the affinities - and even the differences
- between some of the groups Cristina mentions and their American and
European counterparts.

Then there's Bruce Andrews, for example, writing in FLOATING CAPITAL (an
anthology of UK poets from Potes&Poets): "resources made available in part
from innovative American poetries (& poetics) of the 1970s & 80s have
(arguably) helped spur [these poets]". The distances between writers are
vast enough, it seems to me, without bringing country-of-origin
legislation into it.

Will try to answer a few messages in one shot on this Labor day (get
it back to the first of May!) morning --

First a sad announcement: About ten days ago the Swiss-Italian poet
Franco Beltrametti died suddenly. He was one of our last great
peripatetic travelling companeros, at home as much in Kalifornia or
here on the East Coast than in Japan, Holland, France or Italy. & one
of the gentlest sould it has been my privilege to know. Here a little
poem from his book _Target_.

        Good that Jerry filled the experiemntal/concrete/soungpoetry
gaps in my quick list of frog poets. One could add Julien Blaine & the
work of his Marseille group & magazine DOC(K)S (a scene on which,
incidentally, Franco had been very active these last years). There are
any number of other figures to add to my list: Claude Miniere, Valere
Novarina, Guy Darol for example, but also such towering experiemtal
prose figures as Pierre Guyotat (the last French writer, to my knowledge to
have one of his Gallimard-published works censored by the French
Government!). The list is endless...

        Besides the anthologies already mentioned on the list, here
are two other books worth investigating as they have some of the
younger writers not in the other one:

        _French Poets of Today_ published in 1987 by Guernica Editions
(Montreal then, now based in Toronto) I don't know if the book is
still in print, but worth trying to pick up.

        The spring '87 (Vol 30. n. 3) issue of "The Literary Review"
pubvlished by Fairleigh Dickinson Universioty. This issue is subtitled
"New French Writing" & includes some experiemntal prose by Guyotat &
Sollers (from the latter's _Paradiso_) (my translations) as well as
the usual suspects (Albiach, Hocquard, Jabes, Roet-Journoud) plus a
short bit by one of my favorite French (prose)witers, Pascal Quignard.
        Importantly, the issue contains a secoind section edited by
Eric Sellin, called "Francophone Literature of the Maghreb" presenting
writers such as Dib, Alloula, Amrouche, Sebti, Said, Boujedra, Mimouni
& others. Sellin edits (edited?) a magazine called _The Celfan Review_
essentially on Maghrebian writers from temple University where he teaches.
Otherwise Maghrebian literature is unknown & untranslated here.
        I'll pass along more information as I come across it.

Zamir & Clive Bush at Kings College, University of London, The strand,
London WC2R 3LS. They are both ex-students of Eric Mottram who was the
most important figure inb the rapporchement between US & Brit poetry.
(Thge Cambridge group to some large extent folded back upon itself,

A point about "duende" being something like "goblin" is that Lorca, like
many others, was drawing from & (as the situationist might have said)
retourning (retuning?) an expression taken to have deep (if later
bowdlerized) meanings within the culture.  There's a touch of evil in
them goblins -- dangerousness or wildness -- that must have been part of
its appeal (to see that beneath the Disney-duendes of a later generation).
So, I thought too that Duncan, with his fairy/faerie differentiation,
was involved in a similar project -- getting some of that fiery/fury sense
back into the word (& touching on the lore behind the word, if that's
still reachable).  I used to think -- in our old ethnopoetics days -- that
that was what we were largely into.  And I think I still do.

All best,

ps. "Duende" (i.e. GOBLIN) as the name of a toilet paper is probably not so
striking -- except for those of us who get our duendes strictly out of
Lorca.  (Like Katharsis as a going term for (dry)cleaners, I'm told, in
modern Greece.)

Ashbery's "The Poems" has the music of children's books, and "Europe" used a
sort of childish aviator book for much of its text... Kenneth Koch's "The
Circus" part one is one of a few of his experiments in children's book
narrative, and parts of his novel _The Red Robins_ borrow heavily from all
kinds of children's books--he even had Random House print it on rough paper
in an odd format to approximate the feel of a boy's book. Ron Padgett's
"Falling in Love in Spain or Mexico" takes all its phrases from a child's
spanish text/phrase book. And aside from D. Shapiro's "the boss poem" that
Rod mentioned, there are poems using (transforming) children's pedagogical
texts in Lateness, To an Idea and House (I think). Randall Jarrell's _The
Animal Family_ has been illustrated nicely by Maurice Sendak, and Ruth Krauss
did many books on the hazy border between NYschool and kidlit, my favorite
was and is _A Hole Is To Dig_, consisting of excellent juvenile
aristotelianism.

but this may not be what you were asking,

Speaking of Michel De Guy.... He visited recently at LSU, oddly. He was very
open to grad students and junior faculty. Gave a reading and even met with
students at a nearby coffee shop. Which is more than most visting writers
consent to doing. Certainly none of his ability and importance.

And yet only five students arrived at Highland to meet with him. Of those,
perhaps three spoke French. Two faculty also attended. It was embarrasing and
awkward, but perhaps is some indication of how French poetry in general is
accepted in the "official" academy (I of course do not speak of the academics
on this list). Jabes perhaps has some cred simply because he is spoken of
in Derrida.


Thanks, Eric (enpape@lsuvm)

Doesn't Lorca have a chilling essay describing duende as the driving
force behind Spanish poetry?  Can't remember where I saw it.

Ooops.  See that the first mention of duende was re Lorca.  I didn't
know duende meant a kind of hobgoblin.  Why I was chilled by the way he
wrote about duende was that it sounded as though he allied the Spanish
poet with a kind of macho obsession with death.  Maybe he was right but
still chilling.  Gab.

Yes indeed Eric -- the poetry out in one collected volume (Gallimard)
& a lovely collection of essays on poetry _L'Intention Poetique_
(Seuil) both of which -- in toto or in parte -- could use translation.

It's interesting that a lot of the poems referred to me have been
suggested for their verse form, as opposed to direct reference to
Fairy Tales or their plots.  Dorn's _Gunslinger_ could be added, I suppose,
for its Seussian lines.

Jordan:

You mentioned a book, I think, abt NYSchool and its relationship
to kids verse.  What isthe stuff on that?  It sounds perfect.

Thanks all,

This may be jumping the gun a bit, but it seems that I've
been elected to get the ball rolling.

Some of us G2ers here in Vancouver are planning a new publication entitled
TADS.  George Stanley has offered to be an advisory editor (and will
be submitting some material from his new book) and GB might lend
a hand if I buy him breakfast.  I will be involved along with Reg
Johanson (also on this list) and Thea Bowering.

Anyone interested in submitting poetry for the first issue is
welcome.  The more the merrier and it would be nice to have some
connection to the world beyond the Fraser Valley.

Please forward schtuff to either Ryan Knighton or Reg Johanson
        c/o Dept. of English
        Simon Fraser University
        Burnaby,B.C.
        Canada
        V5A 1S6

We're not set up to handle electronic submissions, so sorry.
If you have any questions you can backchannel me at knighton@sfu.ca .
And no this project is not associated with the University. I just
have less mail problems there.

I'd like to mention another source for contemporary French writing in
translation: issues three and four of AVEC magazine.  Issue three has
work by Royet-Journoud, Albiach, Lewinter, Dahan, Guglielmi, Bessette,
Fardoulis-Lagrange, Leris, Du Bouchet, Davie, Colobert, Fourcade (--a
minefield of names, sorry for any typos).  Issue four has work by Cadiot,
Hocquard, Couturier, Risset, Cohen, Alferi, Fremon.  They're available
from AVEC, PO Box 1059, Penngrove, CA 94951. They're $7.50 a piece.

Also, I've been passing on the posts about French writing to Cydney
Chadwick, AVEC's editor, and she writes:

>I don't know if you want to post this on the poetics list but Madame
Renee
at the bookstore Le Divan in Paris is happy to ship books to the states
and open an account for interested readers. All you have to give her is a
credit card # (and of course you get the best exchange rate using a
card).If you want more information, i'll give you the street address and
tel.of Le Divan."
>

I can post the address if anyone is interested.

Finally, might as well put a plug in for AVEC's web page:
http://www.crl.com/~creiner/syntax/avec.html

I was really happy to see this thread on French writing (and thanks to
Carolyn F. for starting it, and to Pierre and others for the names).
Now, how about contemporary Russian writing...

Best,

I have visited this page and would like to exclaim - it's terrific! A
very good job you did, Chris. It includes samples of writing and a lot
of great stuff. It's worth a visit! I even linked to it in three
places at the EPC: presses, mags, and what's new.

First place I read Lorca's duende essay was in the introduction to
the Penguin Book of Garcia Lorca's poetry. It was a big item among
the young poets in Vancouver ca. 1960.

Like Franco Beltrametti, a wonderful witty gentle person who died much
too soon.

The best one volume intro to contemporary Russian poetry that I know of
is Third Wave, edited by Kent Johnson (who may or may not be the
trickster behind the fictive Araki Yasusada) and Stephen Avery, with by
Alexei Parshchikov and Andrew Wachtel (U Michigan, 1992), which grew
out of Kent and Stephen's participation in the 1989 Leningrad
conference.

All these poets seem bedeviled by the relationship of writing to
nationhood. Beltrametti, whom I only met twice (once at Canessa Park in
SF and once in the south of France), was I believe from Belgium or
Switzerland and had a knack for European languages akin to Pierre or
Anselm Hollo's. If his work isn't well known in the west, it's
precisely because of that ambiguity of place.

The Russian literary scene seems to have been exploded with the end of
the Soviet state. Many of the best Russian poets are now expatriates
(like Ilya Kutik) or at least spend as much time out of the country as
possible, while others have watched the safety net that was Stalinism
collapse out from under them (such as Parshchikov who, last I heard,
was homeless and living a street alcoholic's life in Moscow, less than
a decade after having been a very successful editor of an agricultural
youth magazine and a stint in California, where the alienness of it all
proved too much). I haven't heard in ages from or about Ivan Zhdanov,
who was already at the Bob Kauffman/Gregory Corseo level of social
tenuousness before the collapse of Communism.

There is no question in my mind that many of the best/most exciting
writers of my generation are Russians, but it seems very difficult to
imagine what the future of Russian (or, more broadly, "post Soviet")
writing itself can be under such circumstances. Somebody like Arkadii
Dragomoshchenko, after all, is Ukraine by birth and would, in today's
circumstances, never become part of "Russian" literature alongside a
Tartar from Moscow like Parshchikov or a Siberian like Zhdanov.

I have often wondered what it would be like, as a life experience, to
participate in a literature of fewer than 100 million people, like
French (say). Imagine California poetry as a national literature. That
would I imagine change the experience of a "career" as a poet a lot.
Leland Hickman's willingness to publish poets not strictly local to Los
Angeles would have seemed an even more radical act than it was (and, as
it was, it got him pretty well ostracized in LA).

And I used to think that some of the great similarities between Russian
and American writing had to do with their vast populations and expanse
and multicultural roots COMBINED (very central) with a deep ambivalence
about their relationship to Europe. But that Russia doesn't exist any
more.

To support the mentions of Shamoon Zamir and Clive Bush (King's, London)
and Peter Nicholls (Sussex), and add a couple to the names given so far:
also at Sussex are Andrew Crozier (Ferry Press, co-editor of A Various
Art) and Drew Milne (Parataxis). Crozier is an original "Cambridge Poet"
if that term has meaning, tho as Pierre suggests the "Cambridge School"
is, if anything, an even less structured group than the "objectivists". It
hasn't imploded though, it's fragmented, with lots of little plants,
runners or suckers around the place. Sign of good health in plant life.

The "Cambridge Poets" are taken quite seriously now, for instance by
Michael Schmidt who teaches at Manchester, and publishes John Riley and
Michael Haslam in Carcanet Press. He has, for instance, supervised
postgraduate work on Grosseteste Review, one of the mags most closely
associated with Cambridge. Much more sympathetic, and broader in range and
insight, would be people like Robert Hampson (Royal Holloway, London) or
Peter Middleton (Southampton), or Tony Lopez (Plymouth). There are also
little enclaves of interest in Essex (John Muckle), York and other places
where I can't place the names. Two sympathetic colleagues in Durham who
do at least read the stuff are Diana Collecott and Gareth Reeves.

It's even possible to study Bunting in the UK these days, George: Essex
and York include him regularly in their Masters courses, and of course
here in Durham, at the Basil Bunting Poetry Centre. Being dead helped his
cause no end - I'm working on the same premise myself.

Two new ones from Reality Street Editions, 4 Howard Court, Peckham Rye,
London SE15 3PH (also through SPD):

DISTANT POINTS Peter Riley six pounds fifty (yes! he's said to be a
"Cambridge Poet") - the first chunk of a long work built on archeological
reports. Surely someone will do a collected, or even a selected, Peter
Riley soon?

O'CLOCK Fanny Howe six pounds fifty - poems written in Ireland and the UK
- good as ever:

                Rambling snowmounds and still sheep along
                Cheviot Hills, dense fog, dots of dirt,

Dear Ric C:

A couple of days ago you mentioned John Riley's "Czargrad" as one of the best
poems out of the UK in twenty years.  I wonder--if you've time--if you might
elaborate a little.  What, in your opinion, makes it so?  What are some of the
competitors?  Don't mean to put you on the spot:  feel free to ignore this
public query.

Regarding the "Cambridge School," I've recently had brought home to me in
correspondence the degree of skepticism about the career and activities of the
late Eric Mottram among some of that group.  The smaller the pie, the sharper
the knife?  Or something more serious?  Another query to be ignored at your
pleasure.

Subject:      UK poetry

The following message intended for Cristina Brown was returned to me as
undeliverable, so I'm posting it here, as an addendum to recent messages from
Pierre, Ric and George. By the way, I'd like to endorse much of what Ric said
about the US/UK relationship. And to add that while it's good that folks are
getting interested in current French and post-Soviet writing, I'm forever
mystified why "interesting" British poetry is still so widely ignored in the US.
Can't be a translation problem, surely....

Dear Cristina,

Just picked up your request from the Poetics list. Small correction: John James
lives and works in the city of Cambridge, but not at Cambridge University -
you'll find him at Anglia Polytechnic University. Andrew (not Anthony) Crozier
is at Sussex. Others you may want to contact for leads: Drew Milne, also at
Sussex; Peter Middleton at Southampton. English depts in each case. Ric Caddel
you already know.

Worth contacting in the US, as well as Peter Quartermain, who has already been
mentioned: Romana Huk at the University of New Hampshire. Sorry, don't yet have
a proper address for her, as she's only recently returned there after a couple
of years here in the UK - but she's planning a big conference at UNH for 1996 on
current
UK poetries. She's done some work on Denise Riley, John Wilkinson etc.

I am not an academic so I'm not the person to suggest to you how to go about
these things, but hopefully you'll find some of the above helpful. Please feel
free to ask me anything though and I'll do my best to help. As you may know, I
was co-editor of The New British Poetry, along with Eric Mottram who sadly is no
longer with us - he would've been the best person to help you but died suddenly
last February.

All the best,

Ken Edwards

Subject:      Re: duende

About Lorca's duende & blues, you might want to check out those lyrics in
which the blues are personfied, emerge as living beings, to fill the
singer/poet with deep song, deep thoughts, or draw it out of him/her.  E.g.:

        woke up this morning
        blues all around my bed

etc. That kind of thing.  And then the way one speaks of having the blues --
not in a negative way but as it allows the song/ the poem to come -- is
very reminiscent of Lorca's duende & his take on cante _hondo_.

It's also useful to not forget the popular thrust in Lorca & other germinal
poets of language.

Legend has it that when Dallas Wiebe wanted to do his dissertation on Ezra
Pound, he was told by the department that he couldn't for the same reason
as George Bowering was told he couldn't study Bunting. Wiebe, so the story
goes, then suggested Wyndham Lewis as subject for his dissertation. Reports
tell us that the faculty involved were unsure whether or not Lewis was alive;
as they didn't want to admit this, they approved the dissertation plan.

Wiebe was doing his graduate work at U of Michigan.

Cheers,

An aside to Ron's mentioning of poets who write in languages of fewer
than 100 million people. It gets more difficult: think of Hungarian
writers and Finnish writers. But there is another problem too, for
writers who write in French in Quebec or Tahiti, or writers who write
in English in Canada or new Zealand. In Canada the few readers there
are are likely to be reading US writers rather than Canadian ones
because of the US imperialist control of Canadian distribution.
Concerning your question, Ron, about Califormia being a national
literature. What if it were all in Spanish?

But, Ron, the title "All Acts Are Simply Acts" is, to my mind, wholly ironic, and everything in the book works against it. When acts are simply acts we can charm ourselves with such matters as the placement of words on the page. Or whatever.

Re Williams & "boring": I was in a "workshop" back when I was young in which
the "teacher" (an award-winning poet w/ major trade publications) read us,
what else, The Red Wheelborrow & then asked the class "what is this poem
about"-- he got several responses none of which were *the one* he was looking
for-- after a bit of silence he sd, quite seriously, "well, obviously it's
about Spring."

I've been following the conversation about Eng writers and
Universities. It's good to know something is happening with
Bunting and the "cambridge"poets, Mottram etc. It always seemed
strange that way back in the fifties there was a total silence abt
U.S. poets and poetics in Britain (as far as I cd tell). It was not
till I got to New Zealand that I found out what was missing
from my education (at Cambridge). It was Creeley's writing
that sent me hunting for Bunting's books in London in 1977 (damned
 if I cd see much.  "Who?" they said in places like Hatchards).
Good luck & cheers

Ron -- re small nations: you should come along next time I travel back
to my own tribe, the Grand-Ducal nation of Luxembourg, with only
370000 bona-fide members & I'll take you to one of our writer's union
meetings -- about 65 members strong right now, writing in several
different languages -- Letzeburgesch, French, German, Portuguese,
Italian & one or two even in English -- it's strangely exhilerating to
note that books of poetry by eithewr of the two small presses over
there are printed in editions of 1000 copies -- which is about the
same as small to medium presses over here do.

The volumes of DLB which Kit Robinson refers to (v40, 1985, two parts) are
useful as a starting-place for UK poetry up to the early eighties. Because
they claim to cover ALL UK poetries of that period, there are a lot of
boring people in there, and a lot of interesting ones left out (presumably
a lot of boring people left out, for that matter...). The interesting
inclusions include: Hollo and Raworth (as noted), Prynne, Roy Fisher, Gael
Turnbull, Tom Pickard, John Riley, and a really spiffy one on Lee Harwood
by me. There's also a little press round up, which leaves out much
(including Fulcrum and Trigram), but includes Ferry, Grosseteste, Migrant,
Goliard, Writer's Forum and Pig Press!

One hopes that one day Bruccoli-Clark will do a follow-up volume. But
spare a thought for those wandering souls who fail the country-of-origin
test of these strictly controlled formats: for instance, where would Pierre
Joris appear? Answers on a postcard... (Pierre: would you like to say
what volume you'd like to appear in, and who you'd choose for company?)

Keith, it's far better to put me on the spot about "Czargrad", I tried to
write about it years ago and failed (the bits I did write about John
Riley are referenced in DLB40). Besides, I'm sure you recognised my
blurb-writer's mode in any claims I made for it. Read it: It's a sustained
piece of musicality, written at a time when Riley had assimilated the
bits of "open field" which he wanted, (and rejected the bits he didn't
want) and was revelling in life in general. It relates to his conversion
to Russian Orthodoxy, but it's not an evangelical tract - Riley's "Holy
City" is more closely related to the down-to-earth suburb of Leeds where
he lived, tho it's infused with little bits of European history. And
light - there's light everywhere in Riley's poems.

One of the accusations made against the Cambridge poets (generally,
rather than specifically) is that they're icily "intellectual"
("intellectual" is a term of abuse in UK). Nobody could ever accuse John
Riley of being icy.

Well, you did ask...

tom -- this is not the source you're trying to remember -- but look at
Bob Kaufman's poetry for a direct link between Duende and blues -- not an
assertion that it's the _same_ phenomenon (I don't see how it could be)
-- but a crucial link -- also in the Steve Jonas book that Ed Foster
published a bit over a year ago --  and Jayne Cortez ,,,, and so on

Ken -- who was it remarked that Britain and America are peoples divided
by a common language?

The real problem I see is the simple one of distribution -- _most_ of the
poets mentioned recently, even those of the Cambridge "school" -- are not
easily found in US book stores -- (Hell, for years you couldn't even buy
a copy of Wilson Harris here, and he's published by Faber!) --

When I do spot an interesting British poet in a mag. or an anthology (or
hear about one in a Tuma talk somewhere) -- then I can start working the
phones to turn up a copy -- but it ain't easy -- even the Caracnet titles
I've gotten over the years have all been found in obscure used book
stores -- though I would hope none of what I just said is true in NY --

why is williams boring, jordan? aside from the fact that so much he did had been done by others better, it has, i think, much to do with the fact that he believed in evidence, like answers to a question. in yr mom's terms, yes, nj is boring.

I know you can read an excerpt (those of you who are EnglishOnly) on

     Great stuff, incidentally.

In the later 1960's Art Historians in London decided that Modern Art
could  be taught, but not examined, because my informant (Leo
Ettlinger) said nobody yet knew finally what it meant. My then colleague
Ivor Davis, in Edinburgh, taught and examined Modern, and was duly
persecuted for same. But survived.

.Bunting and the Cambridge Poets" - sounds like a mid-eighties art band
to me... You struck it unlucky in your trip to London (but then, any trip
to London is an unlucky one, in my experience): 1977 was the year before
OUP reissuued Bunting's collected poems, as a cheapskate photographic
copy of the long-out-of-print Fulcrum (1968) edition. It wasn't until
1994 that they actually reset Bunting, in the new "Complete Poems".

It was Bunting who introduced me to Creeley's work, as he did to
Niedecker, David Jones, Zukofsky, and much else. I'd have been foolish to
have tried to ask my teachers about them - in any case, if you want to
know what's cooking, you always have to go to the kitchen...

Richard"

Hope you don't mind this being public.

I did find a Fulcrum The Spoils in 1977. And got hold of the
cheapskate reprint the next year thanks to a friend in London.
What's London done to you? I still visit, tho I haven't lived there
since 1957. I guess it's not yr home town.
Cheers.

There's a pop-flamenco group called Pata Negra
whose recording "Blues de la Frontera" is a musical
example of the blues/ duende link being discussed.
Incidentally, there's another group by the name of
Amalgama - a collaboration between jazz and flamenco
musicians from Spain and the Karnataka College of
Percussion, from India -  whose work testifies to
the important cultural link between blues/ jazz and
gypsy cante jondo that the Indian Raga provides...

(O, and both groups can be found on a 3-CD compilation
 called "Duende: The Passion and Dazzling Virtuosity
 of Flamenco," put out by Ellipses Arts (Rosalyn, NY)
 last year. Not the greatest title, but a decent comp-
 ilation w/ decent liner notes...

          Aldon, distribution is governed by sales generated by interest.
British poetry doesn't get distributed much because there's not MUCH
interest. BUT we already know from previous discussions here that US small
presses are having a tough time with problems of distribution as well. The
reservations, for distributors, about dealing with small presses from other
countries much compound what is already a reticence on their (and the
poetries' audiences?) behalf.

          Visibility of British Poetries most compatible with a broad
swathe of viewpoints from this poetics list (not writers more generally put
out by Carcanet or Bloodaxe, so much as those poets found in 'A Various
Art' / 'The New British Poetry' or the forthcoming 'Conductors of Chaos')
has diminished over the past 15 years both here and in the US. While small
press publishing and little magazines are arguably on a slight optimistic
up trend here, and there is a blossoming of grass roots organising and
networking, new writing is often published in samizdat style editions of
100 copies or less. (NB there are notable exceptions  -  Pig Press, Reality
Street among them). Hell even the Paladin series (of which Raworth's
'Tottering State' must be the most widely known Stateside) was remaindered
after mostly only about 6 months on the shelves. Useful collections such as
'Future Exiles' have simply been hastily pulped!

          Curiously, for some of the writers living here (and I imagine in
NZ as well) there is a feeling (emergent on this list) that their closest
peers and readers lie at least as frequently in the US as 'at home'. The
old adage you quote of being 'divided by a common language' need not become
a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's a term most appropriate to those
xenophobic literary hacks who are the most tedious of standard english
standard bearers. I'd characterise 'us' as more united by antinomian
tendencies. We're seeking to explore pathways of exchange and discussion
and distribution of both product and process for work in poetry which as
Allen Fisher puts it remains 'necessary business'. Part of that is a
post-nationalistic desire to present appropriate ways for exchange that do
not follow the business-imperative driven cultural asphyxias of
multi-national role models.

unity in diversity is strength in depth

While teaching *Spring and All* last year, I had a similar response
from a student (a good student, too) who had been told by her high
school English teacher "The Red Wheelbarrow" was an allegory of the
cold war. You know, the "red", the "white", tools, all that. Maybe

Yes, it's a problem, and not one that we look to bookstores to answer.
Various UK small presses are available through SPD: Pig, Reality Street,
North & South, Spectacular Diseases spring to mind; and Segue take some
too. Over here we go to Alan Halsey, Paul Green or Compendium for US
books: I've no idea if that would work in reverse. Heaven knows how we go
about finding out what's goin on in, for instance, New Zealand, other
than - as always - asking a friend.

Booksellers tell me that it's BECAUSE we all use these "specialist"
outlets that "trade" bookshops don't touch smallpress poetry imports. The
expression "bullshit" springs to mind.

As for London, Tony, since you asked in public I'll tell you: many
wonderful things (including some of my best friends) are or have lodged in
that city, which Cobbett called "The Great Wen". It's just that when I go
there my breath clamps, I have to shout to be heard, the beer's too
pricey, and I can never ditch the feeling that I'm about to get exploited.
As the home of a central government which has sucked the regions dry for
about four centuries (and hasn't done any favours to most Londoners
either), it creams off national resource to support its mainstream
cultural icons (museums, orchestras, galleries etc) as if it owned them,
and when regional resources come into the country (as in European Union
funding), they get stuck in the "Capital" and creamed off by central power
(I can support this statement at great length, If you like...). Hey, this
internet thing is secure, isn't it?...

Just a personal thing, I guess...

        I was intrigued by Chris Cheek's remarks concerning British
distribution of poetries "most compatible with the broad swathe
of viewpoints from this poetics list."  During the past three years,
I've become particularly interested in the "distribution problem."
The poetics list is well aware that only one major distributor for
such work remains in the U.S.: Small Press Distribution.  During the
past two years, I served on the NEA Small Press panel, chairing
in the second year both that panel and the panel on distribution,
during which time I attempted to the best of my ability to
represent the interests of presses associated with the poetries of
this list.  The task required considerable patience and humor.
Finally, I was also able to move that future distribution requests
be raised to $100,000.  All of this may be moot by now, but the
experience was quite educative.  The panel on small presses was
persuaded to be generous.  During the second year, the budget axe
fell so deplorably early in the list that many presses which would
have or did receive grants the first year did not in the second.

The tax law "reform" requiring publishers to pay tax on
wharehoused books must be rescinded.  The twenty-five or so
remaining literary bookstores must be supported to the
exclusion of even the most seemingly "literary" of the chains.
It might please this list to know that Luisa of the Grolier in
Cambridge (US) survives these days on the sale of poetry associated
with the various interests of this list.  She can be reached
at 1-800-234-POEM, and ships promptly.  Her stock is extensive.

While in Prague this past summer, my Czech friends were lamenting
that, during the past five years, editions of poetry and serious
prose had "fallen" to two or three thousand copies.  The population
of the new Czech Republic is ten million.  The Hungarians were
similarly chagrined.  They falsely believed the situation to be
better here, and were stunned when I gave them the statistics I had
collected while serving on the panel.

The "problem" of distribution is political, and not simply a matter
of supply and demand.

Best,

Carolyn Forche

This may be one area (always look to a technology as a large shift but
maybe with a small gain) that the electronic medium may help--and is
of course the idea behind the EPC's small press and little magazine
areas. (These areas specifically design to promote paper materials.) I
suspect there are many more readers for some of this material than we
think. (OK, maybe a few more.) But think of the possibilities--a
central set of links--or several overlapping centres/centers of
links--where such information can be housed. Listings are free. What
has surprised me is that more presses don't list. But maybe that is
something to come. We have had good reports from some publishers for
whom we have posted announcements, that they see results. Of course
this is why I try to encourage publishers to also provide samples of
work; and we also maintain an area of pedagogical material--since if
one small press book could be brought into every course it would
change everything. But anyway, a place to find out about these
works. Thinking largely, also, of people in regional situations (or as
you say in other countries) where there may not be a place to browse
such materials. Hopefully this medium is serving as another possible
bridge.

My favorite explication of "The Red Wheelbarrow" was one I got, which
explained that it was a tribute to the American Farmer. I mean so
much depends on him.

About being bored with Williams, I would adapt Samuel Johnson's
remark, "He who is tired of London is tired of life." People bored
with Williams should go sit on the curb and wait for the trash people
to take them off. Makes me think of the old woman in the ambulance in
the Williams poem: "What are those things? Trees? Well I'm tired of
them."

- Interesting comment, professor. Personally, I was bored with all the poets I
read straight thru grad. school, but that didn't prevent me from reading them
on my own where, without doubt, I got much more from the readings.  Still, I
never encountered that kind of remark. Maybe you were kidding (?)  Anyway, why
do you think students may be bored by Williams or any other poet?  Why do you
think there is an need felt by students to explicate a poem in the first
place?  I remember after 40 minutes of talking about a poem in class as an
undergraduate, the instructor thought it went pretty well.  But outside, among
students, the feeling was still 'who the fuck cares.'   I've kept at poetry
despite all the professors I've had, and altho some were very good, very few
could make a viable connection between the poetry and the students.  Usually
the points were made between the poetry and the poet; the relevance of the
poetry to the student being a matter of little significance.  It's frustrating
to hear such abstractions as a "general readership" in this country denigrated
as a bunch of silly asses who can't appreciate the diverseness and
sophistication of American literature.  The question is: what can we do about
it?

an aside to George's aside -- two decades ago the Casa de las Americas
prize for best literary work in Spanish in the Americas went to Rolando
Hinojoso for the first of his Klail City novels -- the author was a Texan
-- for many literary academics in the U.S. at the time it came as a

U.S. --

As Victor Hernandez Cruz says of Nebraska: "In this part of Mexico they
speak English."

some of the others on this list probably had experiences similar to mine
in college -- when I announced that I was going to read Spanish as my
"tool" language for a future graduate school, my undergrad. advisors
cautioned me that no "serious" criticism was written in Spanish -- I
couldn't help wondering how they would know that --

Keith, a Degree in Skepticism is an apposite proposal. At least some of

the woman in the ambulance who was tired of trees was the narrator's english
grandmother, wasn't she. (did wcw really have an english grandmother? it
doesn't matter.

to me trees are tiresome as moral mirrors but wheelbarrows are not.
it is an innovation that hasn't lost its character as such.

i hear in "So much depends upon....etc." a quite desperation,
 a very american quiet desperation.

a lot of williams is boring like a lot of a lot of people. but a lot is
not, including that moral wheelbarrow.

Right on duende.  Right on!--as one was wont to say.  The power and
the enabling force of the popular (perhaps a troublesome word) is not
to be forgotten.  I am reminded particularly of Claude McKay's brilliant
insistence on this in *Banjo*.  As a poet, McKay was straightjacketed to
some extent.  He swerved to prose and to that special source/spirit
that inspired (breathed life into) Lorca and lots of folks who
have found blues, North African seaports and Marseilles simpatico.
Pardon the digression on McKay, but he importantly resisted mainstream
and assimilationist dismissals of work and lives that might well be
associated with duende, with a mysterious bundling of beauty and pain.


To others, thanks for the Lorca and Mackey suggestions, but this
was exactly the point of departure for my question.

There are two very different peridical numbers just out, re: jazz.
1) boundary 2, which is mainly interviews of some jazz greats
2) the most recent issue of African American Review, with a nice
piece by Lorenzo Thomas and lots of very nice short takes, including
a 1918 New Orleans Picayeune denunciation of the amoral animalism of
jass and jassism--- yessssss

Yes Carolyn, I completely agree with you  -  as far as the big picture goes
and how the small picture is affected by the big and so on.

My suggestion is, and was when this subject last came up, that we have some
power as a community (albeit one of interests and of communities with
diverse constituencies) to buck the imposition of structure. Loss rightly
asserts the potential of the EPC in such regard. I'm heartened to hear of
Luisa  -  do you have an e-dress or snail address for her? She sounds
somewhat along the lines of Paul Green here, who's been mentioned already.

love and love

The Grolier Bookstore (poetry only)
address is, I believe:

Five Plympton Street
Cambridge MA 02138.

I suspect someone who has access to more than memory can check this and
confirm (or amend).

I'm reminded of a woman who took books back an east London library and

Hello everyone,

I have a little guilt that I've mostly only posted here when I'm reading,
but am on this list at work and don't have time to do more than lurk.

This reading's venue has been changed, so even though this is late to
mention it:

idiom presents

Jean Day and Laura Moriarty reading at Brewed Awakenings, 1807 Euclid at
Hearst in Berkeley, 7:00 PM, Sunday, 10 Sept

This is Alex Corey's series that used to be at Energy Art's Studio in
Oakland.

No significant change in terms--more accurately:
principles of division--in FIFTEEN years (down even
to the immortal strategy of making fun of the foreigner's
name).

Just an observation (not a just observation).

Hmm, many decades ago, when I was qualifying for grad school, I chose
Spanish as my second language at UBC. Maybe because the university is
situated on a promontory of Vancouver called Spanish Banks.

But I still read Bioy Casares mainly in English.

Why the hell should the professor make a "viable connection between
the poetry and the students"? That is the students' job, if they
think that is important. If they are bored by poetry, let them go and
take a course in paleantology and look for a viable connection
between themselves and some trilobite.

Aldon: Sadly, most of the British poets mentioned recently are not easily found
in UK book stores either. They're published by small presses which don't have
access to nationwide distribution. But some at least can be obtained in the USA
from Small Press Distribution in Berkeley.

I must say that I don't know if they like doing mail order business or not,
but Woodland Pattern Book Center is far better than Grolier for poetry,
and, I believe, particularly for poetry which people on this list might
want to find. This is not to knock Grolier, and I know if I was in
Cambridge I would go there and buy some books, but what they carry is, I
believe, more limited in terms of the interests of this list than Woodland
Pattern, or Talking Leaves in Buffalo, or, certainly, the bookstore at
Small Press Distribution in Berkeley (& they most certainly do mail order
business).

Woodland Pattern's address is
P.O. Box 92081
Milwaukee, WI 53202
Telephone 414-263-5001

Small Press Distribution's address is
1814 San Pablo Ave.
Berkeley, CA  94702
Telephone 510-549-3336

I don't have an address at hand for Talking Leaves in Buffalo.

I know the discussion of bookstores and how poorly or well they serve
poetry has come around and gone around on this list before, so I apologize
if these comments seem repetitive.

Thank you, Carolyn, for pointing out the need for change in the tax laws on
warehousing books. Also thank you for your support of various presses on
the NEA panel. Even from across the room year before last (where I sat on
the magazine panel), your support of presses publishing innovative poetries
was obvious & welcome.

One other sad note on distribution. Inland Books, which hasn't perhaps been
primarily a literary distributor, but which has over the years distributed
books for a number of presses (including Chax, although not many books and
the payment record was strange) is, according to a recent report I heard,
going into bankruptcy. I have also heard of another distributor of which I
do not know the name, but which is the primary distributor for New Rivers
Press here in Minneapolis, going through bankruptcy. While bankruptcy
doesn't necessarily mean they will cease to exist, it is nonetheless
disturbing and makes the situation of independent publishing in this
country even more tenuous. Thank the stars (as well as many real people)
for Small Press Distribution. Long may it wave books.

Perhaps; but responsibility for the students to create their relevance
falls on their shoulders just as much as on the prof's--as your comments
about your own relation to poetry suggest.

Re US books available in the UK. This is a personal feel and others here
might well have a different take.

In Compendium, for longest the most consistantly useful bookshop for small
press poetry in London and the UK. (interestingly in the mid 1970s
Compendium had 3 shops in close proximity, one of which had an upstairs
dedicated, as I remember it, almost entirely to poetry little presses and
poetry magazines  - not there is just one shop and poetry occupies one
range of shelving about 2 metres long and 10 feet high) There's a presence
of books published by Sun and Moon, Black Sparrow, Station Hill, Burning
Deck, Potes and Poets, Roof, Coffee House and a smattering of magazines
(assorted copies of Sulfur, Poetics Journal, Talisman).

Inadequate and frustrating, but something.

But I recall Anselm Hollo some years back talking about his period in
London working for the BBC in the 1950s (I believe it was), that one
could get ANY American small press book in the UK then without great
difficulty and that that, more than anything else, was what had changed
the scene and then itself changed over the course of his life. Of
course, much of what made that possible was the paucity of small press
titles during that era.

True Ron, & it was even more so a few years later -- when I moved from
NYC to London in 1970, the poetry section in Compendium Books, run by
Nick Kimberley, was better than any poetry section in any New York
bookshop at that time. (There was also Better Books where many poets
worked). But by the middle seventies, with Nick losing inetrest
(reggae got him) & the energy in the shop going towards radical
gay/lesbian politics, the poetry section withered away. I've always
wondered about the confluence of a wider public interest in (buying)
poetry & the presence of those one or two competent individuals making
the books available.

"Poetry is for interested people" - Zukofsky

Plainly, if your aim is to reach large numbers of people, contemporary
poetry, which is widely recognised as "difficult", isn't the vehicle you
should select. Likewise, if you want a course that's going to be easy to
relate to and not give you any problems, you should give the modern poetry
option a miss. In fact, most courses will present such difficulties, since
the idea is usually to present something you don't know about.

People don't publish in "small presses" simply because they can't be in
"big presses", and as writer and publisher I've no real interest in
increasing circulation to "big press" dimensions (a Pig print run is
c.500; an OUP current poetry print run is c 1700 - so statistically
similar against a UK population of over 58 million as to be not worth
arguing about). But I started publishing because I didn't see the books I
wanted to read, and was concerned from the first to reach others in the
same situation. I'm still working on it. Early interest from the US (based
on two or three shops and half a dozen people) suggested to me that there
at least was a vast continent of articulate and enthusiastic readers of
new poetry: I'm beginning to suspect that this is not the case...

So, one deals in twos and threes. Because much of the material IS
problematical in some way, it doesn't do to compromise over something
like production: in the UK we have a supposed "small press distribution"
organisation called Password, which I dropped out of some years back when
they started to tell me what shape and size and format the booksellers
wanted "my" books to be, and even what sort of covers to put on them.
Usually the suggestions related to increased standardisation for ease of
handling. Now: I design books in order to present texts to readers - the
booksellers can either help in this process, or get out of the way and
sell pulp. Most choose the latter, and that's fine by me.

Interesting to hear the situation in the Czech republic and Hungary, how
closely it matches Poland and Estonia (Estonia has an Estonian-speaking
population of a million, and at the start of the decade they could sell a
whole edition of new poetry - 50,000 copies - in a day). Poets in both
those countries are now involved in short-run publishing, very much as
Chris Cheek describes it. And very exciting it is too.

It's worth saying, as an addition to Cris Cheek's useful summary, that
one of the most frustrating things about Compendium's poetry shelves in
the 90s is near zero recognition of the huge renaissance of avant-garde
writing by female American writers since the 80s; no Harryman at all, no
Dahlen, some Hejinian and Howe, no Day, no Darragh, no Bellamy, no Ward,
no Marlatt. There's none of the interesting younger American poets, under
thirty, say. And there's very few gay American writers from the 80s, no
Steve Benson's Blue Book, for example. In other words, very little avant-
garde writing that, as tended to happen interestingly in avant-garde writing
in the 80s, that wears feminist or queer politics *explicitly* (eg the
author both reads linguistically difficult writing and proudly declares
membership of the women's movement or the gay rights movement). Since a
lot of the younger Americans who I read take it now as granted that you can
do this, be avant-garde and declare membership of these movements, so that
they don't always have to, it's no surprise to me that their work doesn't
get stocked at Compendium either; the initial shocktroops never got sent
in.

Well, Ric, it's a funny ole question: there is a level at which I
don't care (& even relish not being included in anything based on notions
of belonging defined by the nation-state, that monstruous
euro-creation).There is, however, a deeper level at which I obviously
would like the work to be, if not "included," then made visible --& in
that do feel a nomadic "belonging" to any of the various geographical places I
have spent time in. The company is vast & changing -- that is the
great pleasure of the nomadic -- impossible to define once & for all.
In a way, the anthologies that Jerry Rothenberg & I have put together
(Vol I out later this month) are my/our company: there's a couple
hundred plus writers from all over the world in those books -- looks
like home to me!

This is indeed a terrific problem, partly because the Brit establishment
(in TLS, LRB, etc) is even more entrenched and narrowly focused than ours
(and that's saying a lot!) and so it's hard for "alternate" poetries to
break through.  But I actually think it's gotten better the last few
years, what with Peter Gizzi's EXACT CHANGE YEARBOOK with that great
Anglo-Irish portfolio ed. Tom Raworth, Prynne's Chinese portfolio, and
chapbook and so on.

I think something can be done: namely, poets in the U.K. should routinely
send a copy of their chapbooks, little mags, etc. to U.S. journals like
SULFUR, CONJUNCTIONS, DENVER QUARTERLY, LINGO, TO, TALISMAN, CENTRAL PARK
etc.  Anthologists should consider seriously opening up the field and
being sure to include U.K., Australian, NZ, and other poetries in English
rather than the endless mononationalism we now endorse.  Look at those
titles: AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW, NEW AMERICAN WRITING, AMERICAN BOOK
REVIEWetc.  And rather than ghettoizing U.K. poetry in a course called
"Contemporary British Poetry" we should  be sure the contemp poetry
courses themselves are multinational.

I hope some of you might be able to assist me with a question. I'm working
with a graduate student here who is planning a thesis on Persian Gulf War
poetry. The twist, however, is that he's interested only  in poems written
about the War by participants and witnesses, not those penned stateside
during or after the fact by those with no eyewitness perspective on the
conflict (i.e., recent work by William Heyen or Denise Levertov would not
do).  We've identified a number of books and broadsides that may or may not
be relevant, since in most cases it's impossible to determine from an
online record whether or not a given author was actually in the Middle
East.  So, if you've run across a relevant poem in a journal or anthology
whose author was identified as being a PG vet, or if you have personal
knowledge of a poet who was there, please let me know privately at
fmm1@cornell.edu.  The student is himself a Gulf War vet.   Many thanks.

so much + wheelbarrow + chickens = codependency?

It's been a long time indeed since anyone advanced to me seriously the
argument that publishers and distributers respond to "interest" levels --
at least in the context of literature (ass opposed to instant books about
Randy Weaver or advice on how to lose weight by reading romance novels) --

Many of us, for example, have been trying to get an American edition of
C.L.R. James's _Minty Alley_, or even U.S. distribution of same for
teaching in college courses -- no go -- I could go on with other examples
of demonstrable "interest" -- but you see the point -- Was there really
that much more interest stateside in the poetry of Paul Mulddon (who I
_am_ interested in) than any of the other poets of Ireland & England
mentioned here of late?  Interest, as you see whenever you pay your
credit card bills, is created as often as it is catered to --

Harris may not have been the best example for me to use on this list,
since he hasn't published much poetry since his first book.
but--

Wilson Harris is a prolific and poetic novelist from Guyana -- C.L.R.
James once called him "the strangest of living novelists," but James
hadn't read Harry Matthes at the time!  Best starting point might be the
_Guyana Quartet_, a gathering of his early books available from Faber &
Faber.  His books were difficult to get in the U.S. till about 10 years
ago, at which point his Faber volumes suddenly began to appear in US
bookstores --

Recent issue of _Callaloo_ has a special Harris section ably edited by
Nate Mackey -- also good chapters on Harris's work in Mackey's book
_Discrepant Engagement_

_Palace of the Peacock_ is one of the greatest novels I've ever read!

Pierre: Not sure this will help, but I can tell you what happens on
my machine. After hooking up to gopher.lsu.edu, or using one of the
various menu systems to get there, you should see a list of options
ranging from Libraries, Student Life etc. One of them should be
LSU-BR Campus. Select that and you should get another menu, on
which "Body Electric" should appear. After that it's a fairly simple
matter of following the prompts.
     But of course I am directly wired  up to LSU's system and it is
possibly a lot easier for me to hook up then you. Good luck.
     Thanks, Eric.

Exactly right, Marjorie! _Pour la petite histoire_ re the Brit
establishment, when Paul Buck & I did an anthology of the New British
poetry in the very early eighties, the only place we could publish it
was -- as a bi-lingual book -- in France. I sent the book to a range
of Brit publishers, suggesting an all-English edition -- most of them
didn't even bother to answer. It was roughly at the same time that I
was fired drom the _New Statesman_ as poetry reviewer for having
suggested to write a negative review of Dannie Absie's Collected
Dreck.

Robin Blaser runs into something like Pierre's situation. In Canada
he has not been in many anthologies (he's been in mine and Ondaatje's
and Thesen's) because he used to be a USAmerican. In the States he
doesnt make the anthologies like Hoover's because he is a canadian
citizen. Of course some other people didnt get into Hoover's
anthology, such as Lew Welch and Joel Oppenheimer!

Then there's Anselm. British or USAmerican? Well, I think he must be
a Finn, because when I mentioned his name to a bus tour director in
Helsinki, she rolled her eyes and said "Oh THAT one!"

"Um - who's Wilson Harris?"

I'm new to the list, but I can take a crack @ this one.

Harris is a novelist from Guyana, pub'd by faber & faber. Many, like myself,
were probably made aware of his work by Nate Mackey who frequently publishes
him in HAMBONE. The Fall '86 issue (#6) has a special section featuring a
lecture & a Q&A seminar w/ UCSC faculty & students, as well as some critical
pieces. Mackey's DISCREPANT ENGAGEMENT has 3 essays as well.

THE ANGEL AT THE GATE is as good a place as any to start reading.

(Someone searching for precedent to NM's dense prose syntax  &
philosophical/lyrical mix wd do well to look at WH. They're very different,
but there was a 'shock of recognition' when I first read Harris.)

enjoy,

"Music and numbers were (one sees it now) a revelation of a fluid skeleton, a
ribbed body, to be associated with the flesh of the elements, the smooth
flesh of water, the spark and the animal magnetism within the anatomy and the
blood of ancient streams upon which many cultures had survived and above
which they buried their dead in mounds and hills. Our antecedents from all
races and peoples glimpsed that skeleton as they wrestled with floods and
droughts, plenty and scaricity, from times immemorial, antecedents we also
glimpse in the nightsky of the ancient river through the seed of moral
legend, moral theatre that they sowed, primitive constellation and
metamorphoses of the voice of the flute . . . Primitive antecedent. Intimate
refugee."

Thanks to everyone who enlightened me on Wilson Harris. My question was
semi-flippant, out of puzzlement, but he seems pretty interesting from the
descriptions and I shall seek out his novels at any rate.

Thanks too to Marjorie for her helpful comments about distribution of poetries
in English, and suggestions for journals to send review copies to - I shall
follow this up on behalf of Reality Street Editions. NB I have addresses for
most of the journals on that list, but not for DENVER QUARTERLY, LINGO or TO.
Anyone help? And if you know of any other journals that would (sympathetically I
hope!) review the products of a UK small press....

I remember the Compendium small-press section of the 1970s very well - virtually
the space of a whole shop devoted to small press material. I don't think its
demise can be attributed solely to Nick Kimberley's moving on (he's shifted from
reggae to opera & classical music by the way, now writes articles about it in
the Sunday papers - I saw him recently at a concert and had a good chat with
him). Since the 70s the accountants have moved into the book trade in a big way
and now the game is all about brand recognition, profit margins and turning
product over as quickly as possible. I first recognised the change when I went
into Dillon's opposite London University Senate House one day in the 80s with
the latest issue of Reality Studios, which they'd always taken before. The lady
at the desk glanced at it wearily, said: "I really don't think I can be bothered
with this any more" and handed it back.

Ira, you should talk to Mike Hart, who's one of the people running Compendium
these days, and persuade him to stock some of the authors you mention. I've
always found him very helpful.

The thing about Williams was that he succeeded as no other poet has
in doing things that were completely fresh and unexpected. This cost
him readers for most of his life. If you go back to early issues of
those English magazines published around 1910 you find many of his
poems published along with Pound's, along with portions of Joyce's
Portrait, Amy Lowell, Ford Madox Ford, etc.--and Eliot. Then he
couldn't bring himself to climb aboard the High Modernist bandwagon
and his reputation languished for more than twenty-five years.

Funny thing how it was Yvor Wnters in the 1920s who wrote the most
admiring and appreciative comments on Williams--though in later years
they made remarks about each other that were kind of like what
generals say about each other years after a war.

I do hope that I did not offend anyone by being unable to be bored
with Williams. He does tire me out with his variety sometimes,
especially in Paterson--but that is a case of, as a little girl once
said after three hours of Barnum and Bailey, "Too much circus."

I got cut off from the net, UBC is not very giving when it comes to going
over your account limit.  Anyways, I can't remember if I thanked Jordan
for giving me Todd Colby's address.  So thanks if you were not previously
thanked, or thank you again.

        Also I didn't read the 178 messages in my mailbox, just kept on
pushing D, so I'll be lurking for awhile until I figure out what's going
on.  But I'm back for now, but I don't know how long.  I'm not sure when
my account runs out for good.  I think it's december, but I'm not sure.
So if I'm suddenly gone, it's not because I want to be.

Re Williams...Isn't part of the point of Williams's poety to be "boring"?
I mean, somedays I've had enough of bloody swords and crimson ground in
Pound's "Sestina Altaforte" and I'm quite happy to read a bit of Williams
dancing naked around his house.But seriously, "boring" seems to be an
easy word to throw around, although, after teaching Williams to hoards of
skeptic undergraduates, it also seems to be a legitimate word to use. I
would, however, like some elaboration about the way y'all mean it.

I'm sorry that I feel compelled to come out into the light from the
dark serenity of that shadowy world where, I presume, so many lurk (too
dark to know for sure),

but anyway this debate about Williams being boring is to me, frankly,
utterly astonishing (Ed Foster: You were kidding about WCW being boring,
right? Or was it Jordan?) and, if it is to be taken seriously, quite
ironic (it is all too uncomfortably similar to an article in the New
Criterion by Bruce Bawer, that retrograde neanderthal who thinks nothing
good has been written--he says in the piece--since Jeffers, and who can't
see in Williams anything but triteness and who attack's Marjorie Perloff's
work on him [correction: attacks]; in other words, Bawer doesn't get it).

Williams to me is coming to be the most important poet, in the US at least,
in the century.  He has influenced (forgive me if I am beginning to sound
a bit trite and platitudinous myself--but apparently he needs defending)
poetry so deeply and widely that I guess we are taking him for granted or
simply not seeing what is there, like the air we breathe.  He is solid
like the comforting thingliness of his imagery and his music is subtle
and wonderfully unadorned though precise.

To me he has never and I dare say will never be boring. And as I get older
he is ever more wise and heartbreaking, and a cherished friend.

Subject:      permission

I would like to ask permission to include a section, or version, or
segment, --maybe it should be called a cutting or a slice or few
verterbrae or a half-pound-- of the renga in a book the title of
which is BEYOND FREE VERSE.  At first I just wrote it up as below
because it seemed to me that it was like asking permission to print a
picture of a snake dance.

But then I thought maybe it would be best to allow anyone who wants
to claim credit for any of it to do so.

Is this OK?

Here is my present text. I am afraid that I do not wish for
suggestions as to taking some other half-pound of it--I liked this
hunk pretty well. But please let me know if what I say about it seems
unfair. I realize that to some people this will be sloppy
scholarship, but I never did get a Ph.D.

Also, the format is not right in this message, but that's just my
mail server's way of doing things.

          which explains why the pump is busted and why
          he preferred whole afternoons on the phone to that
          crap about not having a cousin on the moon
          capable of keeping the canoe right way up in the cool
          prose of the upper Hudson, dinner's at seven so
          shimmy toward the portabello traction

    This poem grew into existence during July and August of 1995,
    and at the present writing shows no sign of ceasing to grow and
    evolve. It appeared in ever-increasing increments, sometimes
    branching off into variant forms, on the Poetics List owned by
    Charles Bernstein and serviced by the SUNY Buffalo Listserver.
    It was supposed to be a "renga," a Japanese form in which two or
    three poets spend an hour or two adding to or capping each
    other's lines, making an interconnected series of tankas. The
    complete rules for the renga are too complex to present here and
    are in any case irrelevant, since (at least as far as I can
    tell) this is a pretty free-form renga. I have not attempted to
    go back and credit all the individual poets with their lines,
    and I cannot remember and do not wish to research this
    complicated subject. To do so completely would produce something
    like a volume of the variorum Shakespeare. I think that Ron
    Silliman had a hand in it early on,  and that Sheila E. Murphy
    may have contributed the last line or two, at least. I regret
    that none of it is mine, and that I cannot pin down any further
    whose lines are whose. At that time there were some 245 members of
    the list, and perhaps fifty active participants. Perhaps Marjorie
    Perloff, a list member, can find a graduate student who could
    use this renga for a dissertation and straighten all this out.

it's terrific that he wants to use it in his book. At the same time,
I'd like to place a copy of this version in the collaborative poem
section of the EPC. So I ask Tom if it is ok to use his version
(please reply to be directly: lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu) and to second
the offer to the group in case anyone wishes to object.

How about extracting _all_ the versions from the archives, and combining them
into a hyper-renga, where the reader gets to choose which line to follow next?
You'd end up with a branching structure:

                |
               / \
              |  /\
             / \ | \
            /| /\| /\

This would give a rich profusion of possible poems, and allow the reader to
capture some of the interactivity that has been characteristic of this vast,
mutating rengasaurus.


        Tom Beard.

Of course this is a terrific idea. Such a series of files would need
to be assembled, formatted, then marked up. I'd certainly be happy to
provide room for these files in the EPC if anyone were interested in
preparing them...

No, it _is_ _Callalloo_ for the special issue on Harris, not _Caliban_,
though that would be appropriate --

Nate's book of criticism is from Cambridge, not Oxford (it would be
$20.00 cheaper from Oxford, and maybe two more people could afford to but
their own copies) --

Nice work, but the name is Nielsen, not Nielson -- need more e"s in that
anagram -- see Perec --

Charles -- what message? what list? what whole?

My complaint about Charles Bernstein:

It seems that before I launch into this letter, I should tell you that
barbarism
is the driving force behind Charles Bernstein's doctrines.  It is worth
noting at
the outset that Bernstein's politics will leave behind a wake of rotten
reaction
sooner than you think.  By this, I mean that to him, acting like vainglorious
roommates is a lot of fun.  He leaves me no choice but to leave the country.
I suspect that it can be safely said that it's shocking just how haughty he
can be.
Only Bernstein could feel that militant artists are any better than drugged-out
ruffians.

What this underlines, I think, is that one could argue that he frequently
progresses into displays of authority he doesn't have.  His ignorant fantasy
fits neatly into his detestable model of society.  The world would be a much
better place to live if he stopped trying to stir up trouble.  In order for us
to realize more happiness in our lives, we need to understand that Bernstein
is devoid of all social conscience.  It's my hunch that he leads me to believe
that he is abusive.  I want to talk about the big picture: that is no excuse for
illiterate slobs.  He treats inconsiderate twits as objects.  It's not that I
have anything against boneheads in general.  It's just that Bernstein is living
in a dream world.

As it turns out, he seems to think that he is right and everybody else is
wrong.
His statements will cause more harm than good.  Essentially, he can't discuss
anything without talking about vigilantism.  A small child really couldn't
understand that anarchism is irrelevant here.  But any adult can easily
grasp that
Bernstein's idea of a good time is to torture disdainful hippies.  It may be
obvious but should nonetheless be acknowledged that I got off on a tangent.

Bernstein's little world is far from reality.  Regardless of what Bernstein
seems
to maintain, his beliefs are attributable to an ignorance born of fear.  So
don't
tell me that I'm bewildered by the abominable pretentious nature of his
practices
just because he thinks he can impress us by talking about "unexceptionableness
this" and "phytosociological that".  In theory, what he seems to be
forgetting is
that he is up to no good.  But in reality, the use of long run-on sentences,
bad
metaphors, multiple misspellings, and inappropriately-placed $5 words like
"reticuloendothelial" does not help his cause at all.  I am not mistaken when I
say that you'd think he would see how stingy and unrestrained he appears.
Bernstein
has the gall to think that uncouth ignoramuses aren't ever anti-democratic.
Like I said, he represents a new breed of uncivilized polemics.

Ok, I admit that it disturbs me that these flabby fraternity fellows have so
little
tolerance for differing points of view.  But he is deliberately manipulating
the
facts.  There is little doubt that he can't throw away his integrity and expect
the world to respect him for it.  I had a brief conversation recently with some
sappy teenagers who were trying to destroy our moral fiber.  That conversion
convinced me that Bernstein's desire to influence the attitudes of dominant
culture
towards any environment or activity that is predominantly vapid is
incontrovertible
evidence that he harbors some foolish grudges.  I feel this way because it would
please Bernstein greatly to draw unsuspecting paranoiacs into the orbit of
heinous perfidious fault-finders.  So let me make it clear that if he is allowed
to marginalize me based on my gender, race, or religion, the implications can
be widespread.  Should we blindly trust such uncontrollable self-deceiving porn
stars?

In that respect, we can say that he is trying to deflect attention from his ugly
arguments.  As for the lies and exaggerations, I am merely pointing out what I
have observed.  It is important to realize that it's a well-known fact that I
don't see how Bernstein can be so crude.  He gives new meaning to the word
"socially inept".

I'm indubitably afraid of smarmy crybabies.  His pigheaded hateful attitudes
are
a shout to the world that, eventually, he will ruin my entire day.  I'm really
tired of grumpy virgins.  To put it another way, I can't let Bernstein
undermine
the current world order.  I am asking the readers of this letter to be aware
that
yellow-bellied jerks like him often think they have the right to foster
cameralism
at every opportunity, by which I mean that he has a long,
commercialism-infested
history of attempts to make my blood curdle.  His particular brand of
interventionism
will abandon me on a desert island by the next full moon.  These are
situations where
certain viewpoints are appropriate and there are situations where they are
not.
No matter what Bernstein thinks, Bernstein is off his rocker.

If you need proof that you can see exactly where this is going, then just
take a look
at him.  He always sounds like he's reading a prepared speech.  He is
obviously trying
to bombard me with insults, and unless we act now, he'll certainly succeed.
The only
way for Bernstein to redeem himself is to stop being so filthy.

I imagine that none of what he says carries any weight.  I don't see why he
wants to
perpetuate myths that glorify sadism.  A day without Bernstein would be like
a day
without gloomy unpatriotic fascism.  His actions are not just about
antidisestablishmentarianism but also about colonialism.

He never seems to listen to anyone else's positions and reasoning.  His
conclusions
represent explicitly his overly accepting attitude towards unctuous
kleptomaniacs.
I urge you to join me in my quest to fight disagreeable bourgeoisie.  The
world would
be better off if Bernstein had never been born, period.  To put it crudely,
he is not
known for interpreting facts rationally or objectively.  The continuing
misunderstandings that some sleazy deadheads seem to have merely underscore
this
point.  And that, in my view, is our real problem.

Dearest recipients !

I cannot believe my most recent action !  For those of you who received my
complaint letter about Charls Bernstein, (that would be the entire list
wouldn't it !  Oh dear me.... how shall i... OH !), i apologize.  This letter
was not meant for all of you.  You see i am new here and am very eager and
full of vim for this Super Information Highway.  It's so amazing !
All this information !

I am also a poet, like many of you, HELLO FRIENDS!  I want to share
with you some of my poems.  Are you still interested in Rengas ?  I have
54 pages of them i will post next week.

So good to be here.  Feels like home !

Bye !

I can add to the decline of poetry in Compendium -- going in there
1977/8 and checking out the Creeley on shelf (Marion Boyars editions
mainly) and at the counter was told that Creeley had nothing to
say that was interesting ---   politically.

David, It is probably not a good idea to post such a large document to
this list. It could overload the accounts of many people...

I'd liketo add something to the comments about Bernstein.

When he was here for the Blaser fest I was just disgusted by the way
he ate french fries. Agh, picked up the ketchuppy ones with his bare
fingers and jammed them sideways into his mouth, while talking about
USAmerican poetry.

AND have you looked? He was wearing brown socks with black shoes.

If someone will be willing to do the assembling, I'd be happy to do
the programming to create the Web pages. I've already done some
sketching for how to do this.

The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The caravan of windows to what they flee
These lace curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Mollycoddled than aware, thin-spined and pebbling
but narrow in the waist or waspish Sunday years ago
Over coffee topped with whipped cream, the Times blowing

bleached ribcage ripcorded into compassed wind

I can't take credit for the end, as you have mentioned.  I'm somewhere in

Hello David!
Welcome to the list.
As a sleazy deadhead of the first order & having traveled in Tibet and spoken
with many lamas (not Lamas, mind you) your appearance here was prophecied
unto me & we wld like to welcome you to our boring Williamsian hullabaloo &
say that we agree w/ everything you said abt Charles Bernstein & are hoping
he will consider stepping in for Jerry Garcia so that the transparent
evilisms of post-industrial poetry & music might be more easily located when
the time of destruction arrives.

I don't have a watch, but I like to.

This
transcript is in a modified Conversation Analysis transcription method.
All *uh*s and *um*s are recorded as well as cut-offs (abruptly cutting off
a word in mid-utterance, indicated by a hyphen at the end of the word) and
restarts (repeating or rephrasing what same speaker just said).  Also,
punctuation is used to indicate intonation.  A comma (,) indicates a
falling-into-rising tone, similar to the intonation used in counting or
listing items.  A period (.) indicates a falling tone, not necessarily the
grammatical end of a sentence.  Pauses are indicated by a period within
parentheses.  Longer pauses can be timed and may be indicated in tenths of
seconds within parentheses -> (.2).   Words in caps are stressed slightly
more than others.  (hhh*) indicates inhalation; (hhh) indicates
exhalation; asterisks around words indicate that they are spoken at a
lower volume than surrounding speech.

I'm sorry, too, that our sex games got so far out of hand.  Yes, I, Kevin
Killian, let us whole thing go too far.  I should never have pushed Dave
Ayre to the very limits of pain and pleasure.  It was I who force him to
say mean things about the man he loves most deeply in all the world-in this
case, Charles Bernstein-before I let him touch me.  I got this idea out of
Proust, vol 3 I believe, when the evil girl forces the musician's daughter
to bring out the picture of the dead father while they make love in front
of it, bringing tears to the daughter's eyes, tears of shame, tears of
remorse, tears of a dark lust that neither Dave nor I can forsake for the
sake of propriety or any other motive.

Dave, Dave, did you have to push that send button and broadcast our FOLIE
all over the known universe!

There's nothing worse, as Proust always said, than an uppity bottom.
Sorry, all!  And how could you, Charles, have known what a Proustian part
you were playing in this age old drama of revenge, suspense, and long
distance love affairs?

Goodbye.

Subject:      A happy result of a long process

I know some of you are tired of the whole renga ordeal, but this is my take
on the subject.

I was asked to contribute to an anthology of "erotica" (ie porn) called
"Switch Hitters" (from Cleis Press) the premise being, everything else
being equal, that lesbians would write gay male erotica and gay men try our
hands at lesbian erotica.  The editors encouraged me, saying that I, I
Kevin Killian, had one advantage - because I, unlike many of the other male
contributors, have actually  seen a vagina.

Still I was stumped for a topic, no, what would Henry James call it, a donnee!

So when the renga began to appear, I found it!  My story, "Renga," takes
place at a writers' colony in Connecticut, the narrator is a New Formalist
called Jane, whose tired old poetry has begun to bore even herself, tho it
has won many prizes.  A young girl comes to her bungalow every morning with
her breakfast-this girl, an aspiring, perky language writer, re-invigorates
Jane physically and changes her entire approach to poetics when the two
collaborate on a renga together.  (And much else, since the editors demand
1 sex act on every two pages.)  All this on the sunny beaches of Long
Island Sound and the exquisite, semi-secluded grounds of the writers'
colony.

When I was casting about for a name for this vibrant character, the maid, I
was calling her "Karen"-don't know why!  But Dodie suggested, "Lee
Ann"-don't know why!  Anyhow the story was finished, accepted, look for it
in February, and thanks everybody for all your assistance and inspiration .
. . you will all recognize your individual lines of poetry for sure.

Okay-see you!

Dear David,
         You won't catch me taking your post at face value, no siree!
If I have one complaint about this list, its the extraordinary failure of
its members to detect irony. Is this a function of the technology i ask
myself or of the much vaunted American innocence (American innocence??*!!)
Well, David, you can't fool me. Your address is MINDLINK. BC. You must be
having me on. My considered opinion is that you ARE Charles Bernstein.
The messge he (Bernstein) claimed to post shortly before your own  was very
suspicious: This Message Intentionally Left Blank. I got the allusion to the
opening lines of Bruce Andrews' CONFIDENCE TRICK immediately, and thus the
reference to his own list leadership. And, of course, recalled the many
resonant 'blank' phrases penned by Arakawa and Gins about whom Bernstein
(you) have written so eloquently. From TO NOT TO DIE for instance:'Each
neighbourhood, nest of fields, acquires a momentum of its own: lets loose a
forming blank: this is a blank screen as much as a blank projection.' And
then

     The many-hinged, the cleaved

During the cleaving something becomes apparent and something remains blank

A group of cleaving, transferring in cleaving, an image or a blank

In the sweep of cleaving, the sweep of appearance or disappearance.

So, I'm sorry, this outburst of self-hatred, does not change one aorta
my loyalty to you,or--and I say this knowing full well there is a stain of
truth to George's cruel jabs--or lessen one smidgeon your undaunted charm.
        yours truly
           Wystan

re magic names,

Keith Waldrop has an entire poem, comprised of 'em. I don't own a copy of
the poem (as it is magic), but I may be able to recall a few:

Keith Waldrop:        lad with poker

John Hawkes:          jaw he honks

I'll ask Keith if he wouldn't mind reminding me of a few others.

Simply to endorse Pierre's placing of himself - and many more - in a
transnational fellowship of poets, and Marjorie's call for the
non-ghettoizing of UK (or any other) poetry. Of course, UK folks are often
accurately caricatured as serials offenders in this: the irony of my
editing "26 New British Poets" for "New American Writing" was not lost on
my ever-ready critics. Paul told me that his transformation from Oink! to
NAW was grant-application driven - having persisted with Pig Press for 23
years I can certainly appreciate that...

Could I invite the RENGA PEOPLE to delete the "forwarded message"  symbols
(>>>) from the beginning of each line, unless they're integral to the
structure? On my primitive screen the >>>'s now take up half the width,
and the text is falling off on the right so that the difference between
the renga and "in no way is this a renga" is - at first sight - lost.  But
keep it coming!

Subject:      It is better to be ruined attempting the impossible
Comments: cc: Neil_Lazarus@brown.edu

"His work as a whole is a protest against the deadly temptation
to make it easy for oneself by renouncing all happiness and all
truth.  It is better to be ruined attempting the impossible.  The
art he is preoccupied with--tightly organized, seamless, and
rendered completely sensory precisely through its conscious force--
is hardly capable of realization.  But it embodies a resistance to
the unspeakable pressure exerted on what is human by what merely
exists.  It acts as a representative of what might one day be.  Not
to become stupid, not to be lulled to sleep, not to go along: these
are the social stances sedimented in [his] work, a work which refuses
to play the game of false humanness, of social complicity with the
denigration of the human being."

"That the division of labor cannot be banished by denying it,
that the coldness of the rationalized world cannot be dispelled
by recommending irrationality...is a social truth that
has been demonstrated most emphatically by fascism.  It is
through more, not less, reason that the wounds dealt the irrational
totality of humankind by the instrument that is reason can be
healed."

"Wittgenstein's maxim, 'Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be
silent,' in which the extreme of positivism spills over into the gesture
of reverent authoritarian authenticity, and which for that reason exerts
a kind of intellectual mass suggestion, is utterly antiphilosophical.
If philosophy can be defined at all, it is an effort to express things
one cannot speak about, to help express the nonidentical despite the
fact that it identifies it at the same time."

"The soundness of a conception can be judged by whether it causes one
quotation to summon another.  Where thought has opened up one cell of
reality, it should, without violence by the subject, penetrate the next.
It proves its relation to the object as soon as other objects crystallize
around it.  In the light that it casts on its chosen substance, others begin
to glow."

"The only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair
is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves
from the standpoint of redemption....  Pespectives must be fashioned that
displace and estrange the world, reveal it to be, with its rifts and
crevices, as indigent and distorted as it will appear one day in the
messianic light....  Even its own impossiblity it must at last comprehend
for the sake of the possible.  But beside the demand thus placed on
thought, the question of the
reality or unreality of redemption itself hardly matters."

"Theodor Wiesengrund was born in Frankfurt am Main on 11 Septemper 1903.
(Weisengrund-Adorno was the name registered at his birth, on his mother's
request, and it was the name he used as a music critic in the Weimar period.
During his exile in California in 1943, his final, officially registered
name became just Adorno, while Wiesengrund shrank to the initial W.)"


[The first and second quotes are from "The Artist as Deputy (in NOTES ON
LITERATURE vol.1); the third is from the best piece of writing on modern
poetry that claims to be writing about modern philosophy, "Skoteinos, or
How to Read Hegel" (HEGEL: THREE STUDIES); the fourth quote is from the
section of MINIMA MORALIA called "Memento" (a meditation on writing that
reviles Benjamin's "The Writer's Technique in Thirteen Theses") and the
last is from the "Finale" the same book; the biographical note is from Rolf
Wiggershaus's THE FRANKFURT SCHOOL.]

Subject:      Errata (not so sweet)

It's what I get for adding my two cents, but when I called Adorno's
"Memento" section of MINIMA MORALIA "a meditation on writing that reviles
Benjamin's 'The Writer's Technique in Thirteen Theses'" I rather meant to
write "rivals."  But the difference is "thin" as a former teacher of mine
used to put such things.  (I also mistyped "ei" in one of the
Wiesengrunds).

As penance I offer the following (quoted without permission as always):

"His Words in her heart rather than upon her lips (A&H) correspond to an
old need so authentic modern works are criticisms of past ones (A1)
beloved by the gods and as such he [sic] (A2) So much for Tragedy and
Epic poetry (A2) _hominum_ [sic] _dabit homini_ [sic] _A te petatur, in te
quaeratur, apud te pulsetur: sic, sic_ (A3)

    A&H-Abeland & Heloise / A1-Adorno / A2-Aristotle / A3-Augustine"

Subject:      Re: SPECIAL AGENCY

OK, I'd just like to clear something up. I know David Ayre, I've worked
closely with David Ayre, & believe me he's no commercialism-infested desert
island. We're talking about a man capable of the most inert pseudo-expletive
non-existence. He's sexually attracted to the bandaged, ya know, to the
head-wound type, to the bandaged. His eyes bug out in a serotonin induced
trance at the first whiff of certain crucial facts. His organelles are
self-ordered and invariant, it's disgusting, really. I mean, really. He once
mistook a fire escape for a weapon & is a traditional predator on the tubifex
worm. Christ himself called him an ambidextrous universe. In the end he'll
look like a great bundle of hair.

Of all those institutions that set out in the nineteenth century to
medicalize sex, it was David Ayre, that smarmy neolithic tryptamine, that
conceived & published the greatest
degenerescence. A farm hand from the village of Lapcourt, Ayre paid no
attention to tremendous noises, & as he became older, asked for EXTRA ORDERS
when the firing started.

I won't even begin to describe his 'Master Plan' as it permutates abruptly in
hyperspatial superconductive telepathic rapport Weeping Weeping oer thy cheek
asleep where thy little heart doth rest a chapel of gold secret smiles clothd
in iron wire both cold & heat & no father there & no Anarchist leaders down
among the swine in that hurricane of ooze: this is the Ayre we breath, an
oxidized sandpaper of cyber-assertions growing in our experiment and
cancelling, flattening, defenceless. He is schizophrenic, deaf, & completely
commited to the work ethic. We simply must call a cop or something. The
hospital food is very meagre.  Beware Ayre for it has been written 'No Cult
can make it without enemies." or was it enemas. . . Any case, keep your guns
cocked, no amount or impending demoralization will neutralize his surgical
pedigree.

Ayre is an alphabet of actual insects, a sick zone caressed by the warmth of
the rising sun. Rumour has it he reads Poe.  This morphogenetically obtuse
lump of cramp investigation must be talked to nicely, for we have so very
much to learn, my friends.
My dear, sweet friends.

Subject:      Dave Ayre As I Remember Him

*****Dave Ayre As I Remember Him*********

Let me just say a few words in light of this situation.  David Ayre was a
man.  Truly. He could always get the lids off jars; was always scratching
and sniffing
in places everybody forgot about.
Always needed a butter knife.  Yet above all: the best person in the whole
world.
He was the smartest guy I knew.  He was old Dave.  He was the kindest
soul in the community, never asking questions, always willing to lend his
hammer. He accepted everybody equally.  Every boy loved him. Always had an
opinion.
Never any skin off his back.  Never let the sun go down.
You always knew where to find Dave, even when he told you exactly where
he'd be.  Could be that Dave had seen it all, because he practised what he
pitched.  Maybe he was born that way, or, perhaps, it was in his genes.  In
any case, he was rarely too busy.  He knew how to push the right buttons.
He sure lived.
I think of Dave, holding on, never letting go, no matter how much you begged.
Needless to say, I was shocked when I read about him.  I had trouble seeing
what all the fuss was about.  In any case, it's not the Dave that I want to
remember.  So I say: he will come out in the end.  It is silly to think
otherwise.
He was the stuffing of dreams and, as always, he would continue to make all
the difference.

Thank you.

As someone who once lived on Rod Smith's mail route (& not a one of us
thought it accidental that Smith worked the roads around _Man_assas), I
am disturbed by this charge that Mr. Smith has stolen a letter.  Smith is
above all that. Above all, he is honest as the day is, no tin horn like
that Zukofsky guy Foster was always complaining about when people were
waiting for their mail to arrive, for god's sake.

None of us around here will sit still for such character assassination.
Smith has taken no letter.  They're all right here where they're supposed
to be; we counted 'em up just to make sure.  I know for a fact that Rod
Smith once walked a mile through the humidity just to return a copy of
_Sulfur_ that had mistakenly been delivered to his P.O. box.

It's true that Rod's magazine suddenly sprouted a letter in its title
that had not been there before, but Rod won that letter fair and square
in a poetry slam at the Audubon Society.

sincerely,

sycorax

My finest klobucar,
How good to have news of you after so many burning bridges

I too remember kind ol' Dave. First laid eyes on him sitting in the back at
that Spicer/Yasusada reading with a copy of Vivekananda. He had that youthful
"in this ocean of existence we are all but wavelets" kinda way about him.
Remember how he taught that sweet pup "Stuckey" to open the RC bottles?
Charity is great, but the moment you say it all, you run the risk of running
into materialism. Dave was like that, always another sweet meaningless
comment while divvying up the loot.

And lord the Duchamp show! Attaching playing cards to the bicycle readymade.
. . really freaked that guard's gobble.
And that time we needed to detonate the device, who could we turn to but ol
Dave, (poor Stuckey). And him always quoting that Padgett line, spitting on
us with laughter,  "The natives of Tangiers are referred to as Tangerines."

Ah, the old Daves. . . but I don't remember any hammers. We are talking about
the same guy?

I've seen David Ayres & Charles Bernstein in the same room.

Now that I think of it, you may have as well, but that's another story.

In fact, now that I think of it, I've probably seen David Ayres & Kevin
Killian (or was that Dodie?, Kevin usually announces himself) in the same
room too (the same room as Dodie, well, maybe), though perhaps I didn't
know it at the time.

Wait, now that I think of it, I think I've seen Wystan Curnow, Dodie
Bellamy, David Ayre, Charles Bernstein, Kevin Killian, and Marcel Proust
all in the same room once.

Oops, now that i think of it, it wasn't Marcel Proust at all, it was George
Bowering. I sometimes get the 2 of them confused.

On the other hand, now that I think of it, I've never seen no Rod Smith or
Hal Foster, no how.

says Thomas Bell

But this whole thing has been so much not about permissions. First, it's not
a renga, and no one received permission to call it that or to butcher that
form. Also, I notice that some lines (or at least one I wrote originally)
have been altered already, and I don't think anyone asked permission. No one
ever asks permission of the already existing authors to add to the work,
thereby changing it.

And do you really think you can get everyone who has contributed to give
permission?

Good luck.

When was the last time you went back to *Spring and All* (the whole
thing) or *Kora in Hell*? Perhaps it's only a measure of my own
superficiality, but they still get me, every time. The anthologies
were always too small to hold this stuff, even that wheelbarrow which
sure looks different in its original habitat.

In fact the phrase was traditionally used, not by the person for whom the
microphone was being readied, but by the sound technician whose job was to
ready it; and the ethos of the boring phrase was exactly its renunciation
of being-worth-paying-attention-to. Making the channel clear is not a
matter for self-announcement; and come to think of it, does Homer ever say
"I"?

Subject:      Jobs

Associate Professor of English, U. of Louisville
Phone: (502)-852-5918; e-mail: acgold01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu

I wanted to notify the list of two positions that we're seeking to fill here
this year. Both are assistant professorships; deadline is Nov. 10; AA/EOE.

1. Specialization in postcolonial literatures in English, with strong interest
in second literary field and/or critical theory.

2. Specialization in fiction writing; secondary activity in another genre
(esp. creative non-fiction), literary field, or rhetoric and composition
desirable.

More details can be found in the job ads in the MLA and Chronicle of Higher
Education. Please, depending on your situation, consider applying or alerting
your students to these opportunities.

Given the general interests of the list, it seems a good idea to let you know
that the folks running the fiction search are likely to define that genre in
fairly traditional terms, and not be super-receptive to, say, polygeneric or
indeterminately generic writing--meaning (I'm blathering here) they'll
probably be drawn to people writing stuff that looks like short stories,
novellas, etc. At the same time, I consider one of my jobs in life to nudge my
colleagues beyond the conventional in these matters, and though I'm not
formally involved in that search I will be sitting in on interviews and trying
to open up the field a bit. Bottom line: please write in--I don't want to
discourage you from doing so--but don't get your hopes sky-high. But anyone
who's been on the job market recently knows that.

Subject:      twenty questions

Probably the less said about the language of life, and the more about
linebreak the better, but I'm guessing the new radio show out of Buffalo
won't have the kind of grant money PBS did, nor would it use that money to
produce a very slick set of teacher's guides (including 18 poet cards--bigger
and less exciting than baseball cards). Outreach! they call it.

Here are some "questions to think about" from the teacher's guide to "The
Language of Life" with Bill Moyers (with apologies to C Forche, the only list
member ((I think)) involved). High school teachers will be asking these
questions to future citizens of our various polises (polices?) in the next
few weeks...

Why is "what you dream up" deeper than what you know?

What will you do with your time?

Why should you be suspicious of what you want?

When did you last surprise wounds of your own this long time unmothered?

How _can_ we move toward one another?

How do you know if you can or can't sing?

When do you catch sight of the promised land?

What have you been given for your poetry?

To what do you pledge allegiance?

What is the "myself" that you want to be?

What kind of satchel do you carry your poems in?

How have you honored that floral apron?

When did you last forget _your_ distance?

What are the circumstances in which you are reading the poem?

What would you aim your poems at?

What music is great enough to bring you back?

What leads you back to a person you need to remember?

What happened before you were born that still matters to you now?


I'll be collecting your papers next Tuesday, typed, double spaced...
Jordan

        I know some of you are familiar with Theresa Cha's book Dictee,
so I thought maybe I could pose my question here.  It is:  who is the
woman in the picture at the beginning of the Erato-Love Poetry section?
She's holding what looks like a flag and sword.  I would appreciate any

My favourite memory of Dave Ayre: it was probably 1977, in Bolinas.
Tom Clarke was out for his daily marathon run, and Dave was running
backward in front of him, tossing rose petals in his path. Tom was
shouting evil imprecations all the while, but after 12 miles held his
breath and just made gruesome faces. Sometimes Dave wouild run over
the hill and come back with another armload of blossoms. "You
arsehole!" shouted Tom, "just run. Forget the encomia, forget the
silent irony. Just run for daylight. But David smiled wordlessly. He
was listening to his mantra over and over in his cranium, never told
anyone what it was. Tom didnt know, and it was eating his gut.

Well, Gabrielle Welford asked me to go on, and I have been debating
the idea with myself and a few other people here for a few days. I
dont want to tell you all the things that Charles B. did to turn
people's stomachs during the Blaser fest. But when we were having
our, uh, conversation in his room he kept jumping up to move his
framed 8x11 picture of Kevin K. closer and closer. I could not stand
it after a while. I took the thing he had behind the door and ran as
fast as I could for the cleansing waters of Burrard Inlet, heedless
of the accident that might have befallen me as I ran with tears
welling in my orbs.

1) I am having trouble remembering what I did or didn't
contribute.  I'm not sure how I can give permission for
something I don't remember doing, but am willing to do
so.    Thomas Bell.

2) However, after giving the issue some thought, I'm not
sure I agree with piecemeal publication - what is important
here I think is the process rather than the content.  It is
fairly common to release material and progams to freeware
or the punblic somain with the stipulaion that they only
be released in their entirety.  Other thoughts on this
issue?

How terribly offensive the discussion has turned re Williams.

He is neither vanilla at Baskin Robbins, nor white sauce. And Ron, you
should know better. He isn't butter on biscuits. He is plumb-jam on bagels.

Rengas are stinky cheese, or should be.

Someone asked (rhetorically I believe) if Homer ever uses "I".  So I asked
my husband Stanley Lombardo and he responded:

Yes, Homer does say "I" of himself, In Iliad 2, right before the
catalogue of the ships. And in the first line of the Odyssey
he says "me."

(Stan's translation of the Iliad comes out next fall.)

Why is "what you dream up" deeper than what you know?  I don't know.

What will you do with your time? Besides renga-ing out, "Pinch me
          Alfredo and pass the hot sauce"?

Why should you be suspicious of what you want?  Because I want what
          I'm suspicious of.

When did you last surprise wounds of your own this long time unmothered?
          The last meeting I attended at work.
How _can_ we move toward one another?
          Try a little push-broom.
How do you know if you can or can't sing?
          I cant.
When do you catch sight of the promised land?
          It pokes out my brain and through my forehead.
What have you been given for your poetry?
          A high-five from Bill Luoma.
To what do you pledge allegiance?
          The doppelg nger of Double Cola.
What is the "myself" that you want to be?
          An American Kestrel.
What kind of satchel do you carry your poems in?
          More like, "What kind of Satchel do you carry your Paiges
          in?"
How have you honored that floral apron?
          Hideo Nomo swats horseflies.
When did you last forget _your_
          distance?
          I never knew it.
What are the circumstances in which you are reading the poem?
          Many.
What would you aim your poems at?
          The inside part of the plate.
What music is great enough to bring you back?
          Meat Puppets.
What leads you back to a person you need to remember?
          Notes.
What happened before you were born that still matters to you now?
          Castro.

I'll be collecting your papers next Tuesday, typed, double spaced...
Jordan

Alan -- just out of curiousity -- weren't you guys trying to hire in
postcolonial studies a few years back?  Is this another try, or did
somebody leave?  I know one possible candidate here in the Bay area --

In the chooks ere reamed the dreams wear toques
Flew to rue a doer's light ease by tine's din
Worst cardinal lair

Bowed asunder sun loud
End less use rushing ruse finds
Raving seeded to flee

Placed tains moral-gauzed heads
Coddle-ware spin dribblings
But a row in the ear

Fees top peddling owls
"Heady crude"
To each a cage ordered to compass

A condiment
Rice feasts toothed
Undid in twos

To hose an iffy haze
Fussed into dialing lots
Owls' edgy rental

Linguent spread and heft
Just proxy juices
Guesses still lip to print a named rarity

Is Stan's translation being published by HACKETT in Cambridge, Mass. by any
chance?
Just curious.
daniel_bouchard@hmco.com



Someone asked (rhetorically I believe) if Homer ever uses "I".  So I asked
my husband Stanley Lombardo and he responded:

Yes, Homer does say "I" of himself, In Iliad 2, right before the
catalogue of the ships. And in the first line of the Odyssey
he says "me."

(Stan's translation of the Iliad comes out next fall.)

Hello INFO FRIENDS...

I sit in sad repose as I put pen to paper
concerning an issue I've found most deeply
disturbing.

(sigh) . . .

I am not so sure i like this SUPER INFORMATION
HIGHWAY after all.  It hasn't been so super for
me lately.  Let me share with you my sweaty
parting sorrows...

I have just been forceably removed from 13
discussion lists including Small Engine and
Firearms Repair, Cyber Ceramics, Online Touque
Mending and Friends For Life.

This list is my last refuge, my last hope....  And from
what i've seen so far, things are lookin pretty good !

Bernstein, I, like you have a 8 x 11 picture I keep near
to me.  It's the picture of you on the cover of The Difficulties.
Remember it !  Everyone, do you remember it !  You're sitting on
that porch, a full head of hair all comfortably reclined with an
"I just finished reading Ulysses and it only took an hour !" look
on your face all casual with your junky jeans, shoddy vans with the
droopy laces and a distinctly Canadian shirt.
I keep your picture right next to my 40 x 20 enlargement of the Ron
Silliman cigar chomping, crotch spread Difficulties Issue (they kept
that one behind the counter...).     Charles, every time I think
about you, I touch my elf.

I am proud to be a member of this list, discussing art farts ache.
I will not fall prey to Mr. Killians horny whims, nor George Bowerings
sleazy nerdisms!  Rod Smith and Andrew Klobucar's epitaphical
exagerations are boneheaded to say the least.  As for for Mr. Levy, I have
never been in the same room with ANYONE before never mind these people
you name.  Do you have PICTURES ?!#$!?  HUH ! and who is this Dodie
Bellamy person anyway ?   Is she for REAL ?

To sum it all up, I've had enough of you chauvinist fogeys.
There are three points I need to make here.
.
.
.
And another thing! Andrew, does the word "SEMANTICS" mean anything to you?
And, believe it or not, McKuen is the best-selling poet in modern
publishing
history. His 35 books of poetry have sold over 40 million copies.
But bad news soon surfaced--I know we all share contempt for his popular
books.  McKuen had sold 40 thousand copies of his first volume, Stanyan
Street & Other Sorrows, from his basement before being scooped up by a
Random House.

"what is with this david ayre ?", this Lapcourt farmhand,
this great bundle of hair !

"what is with this david ayre ?",
this avid deary with the dairy air
I'm just trying to be friendly, tis all !
to all my info friends, so . . .
O !  Mr. Killian, you might well just get me,
or might as well just fist me
(excuse me!)
in the end....

yours,
AVID DEARY

San Andres VI- The Balance Shifts
by Cecilia Rodriguez

National Center for Democracy, Liberty, and Justice

       "Lies, deceits, falsehoods; none of this wiII achieve any
thing. The lies, the threats , the accusations can only bring us to defeat
and take us down the wrong road. Only the truth which walks in our heart can
lead us to a just and dignified peace."

                                               Comandante David
                                          Zapatista Delegation-CCRI-CG




Historically, the peace talks achieved a duration of seven days.  The
government delegation
appeared  together with the Zapatistas for a photo opportunity.  They
also  responded to a Zapatista proposal with applause.

And  the  traditional  indigenous discretion born  of  500  years  of
resistance  received  these historic firsts with  measured  optimism,
and a skepticism born of too many betrayals.

Standing and waiting through a diligent rain which soaks through  the
most impermeable
material,  the  observers and the civilians who stand  in  the  peace
cordons watch incredulously.                                       Can it
be  that  the  talks which have been stalled for months will  produce
tangible progress? Is it possible
that  a  day will be possible whose dawn will bring the beginning  of
the end to this terrible siege?

The  long  nights shifted between those where stars were  visible  in
the sky and a fog so thick  that it erased everything in view.

***********************************************************

With  a  massive  force of volunteers, little  or  no  money,  and  a
timeline  of  approximately 8 weeks, the plebiscite of the  EZLN  was
the  most numerous in Mexico's history; 1,088,094 ballots.   It  gave
voice  to  what the Mexican government had hoped would be  silent  or
non-existent; national public interest and sympathy with the  demands
of the EZLN.

The  EZLN  celebrated  the  accomplishment with  a  party;  Zapatista
style.  A  meeting  where the official results of the  Consulta  were
reviewed  was held in a small village reached by vehicles  eventually
left  in the mud. The rain did not stop until the ground was a  large
brown  puddle.  The  speeches reviewed activities  in  the  different
states and internationally.

            ."
Later the crowd from the cities swarmed into a medium-sized building.
At 9 p.m. it settled into an awed silence as the masked Zapatistas
crowded into one end of the room.

"We had prepared a special program but you arrived very late" said one
of them.  "Now we want to ask your permission, shall we present the
program or are you alI going to leave?"



The audience stayed and the Zapatistas presented 3 folkloric dances
and 3 songs. Then the party went on, because the room was warm and the
applause was loud. More folkloric dances were presented with Fin del
Olvido introduced by a masked young woman strewing flower petals on
the dirt floor. Then the audience began to present poems and songs.
Their voices filled with emotion, their faces wreathed in smiles.

It was hard to tell who had received the best gift; the results of the
consulta presented to the Zapatistas or the sight of masked young men
and women who for the moment sang and danced. The party continued
until midnight. It celebrated life in the midst of death,  the joy of
struggle, the warmth of companionship, the certainty that in spite of
alI the media clamor to the contrary, a process had just begun.

The government of course argues that the Consulta did not result in
the numbers expected, that it did not ask whether the EZLN should lay
down its arms, nor about the ability of the EZLN to represent the
people of Mexico.  Miraculously however, the talks  which the
Zapatistas had called exhausted, continued for an historic seven days.

**********************************************************************
******************************
If extremes are the only viable justification for change in society,
then Mexico certainly qualifies. Even Zedillo's State of the Union
address could do little to hide the savagery of  present economic
policies.  There about 8 million people in Mexico's informal economy,
5 million more who earn only one-third of what is considered necessary
to support a minimum standard of life. In order to have a minimal
response to the need for jobs Mexico's economy must grow by 4% per
year. In Mexico City, 70,000 children under the age of 5 suffer severe
malnutrition, a number which has been multiplied six times over the
past 20 years. Only one-fifth of the 670,000 people who are over the
age of 65 have a pension.  Steel and autoworkers in Mexico must work 2-
2.5 hours to earn enough to buy a two pound chicken (in the US they
only have to work about 9 minutes to buy a chicken). In 1995, Mexico
recorded 9,712 cases of cholera with 110 deaths, and 38 cases of
hemorrhagic dengue so far.


In 1995 Mexico will pay out $57,756,000 dollars on its foreign debt,
which is  a number 204% higher than everything paid from 1821-1976 on
foreign debt. Certainly the achievement of a social transformation
capable of altering these statistics will be a difficult painful and
long process, something which the  Zapatistas clearly understand.


The review of the litany of human suffering through numbers can
sometimes elicit a human response.  The numbers at the opposite pole
are even more dramatic. There are numbers with many zeros to represent
the wealth of select individuals who remain power to the brutal
detriment of millions.  Shock, dismay, tension, empathy; these are the
emotions necessary to elicit the attention or the media, the gut
reaction of the majority of the public.

Yet the silent determination of hundreds of campesinos in the
militarized villages and the patient labor of the Zapatista
delegation go unnoticed, In this age of commercialized emotions. To
understand the trajectory of the Zapatistas requires a different
mindset, one which goes beyond simplistic formulations of power, one
which challenges the distance between many of us and the human
family.
At 2 a.m. when the mist was especially cold and wet I turned to
another international observer and asked, "TeII me something, can you
imagine people in the United States leaving home and family and
standing all night in the rain? What do you think would move people
like this?' "Frankly nothing..  l can't imagine such a thing...maybe
only something which was a direct threat to the well-being of their
families...maybe ."

The Zapatistas have distinguished themselves in history by being
willing to advance it, by allowing and fighting for a democratic space
in which the people of Mexico can re-discover each other and
themselves.  This space was first constructed in Aguascalientes,
Chiapas and carved out of the mountain with loving hands. It was
filled by a people, groping to find a different way, a way beyond
parties,  dogmas, and the socialization of 65 years of centralized
government. The space widened in the simple process of the Consulta,
which gave people basic experience in the vague notion of "democracy"'
that social concept expropriated by demagogues and berated by those
who believe it should be neater and more efficient.

The Zapatistas know that that space will be rarefied if combat should
begin, that to construct  a social vision common to 90 million people
will require much more than bullets and uniforms. It will require
dialogue, the exchange of ideas and concepts, time, experience, and
the growing participation of millions; none of which can be easily
pursued in open combat.   It will require a new consciousness from
those in the civilian and international movement, one which allows new
energy, ideas and methods of work to evolve.

As far as the EZLN is concerned, it is the fact that reason and not
rage or hunger for power dominates their decisions, that the
willingness to sit at the negotiating table exists.  Official
government broadcasts on September 11th announced "  The EZLN and the
federal government have reached their first peace agreement."

For seven days the Zapatista delegates sat at the table for 10-12
hours with the government. Then, in short hurried meetings until 2 or
3a.m., they met with countless delegations from around the country and
the world to share their thirst for justice and a peace with dignity.

What the government claims is their achievement is in reality a
proposal made by the EZLN months ago.  This round established rules
for procedure and a basic agenda for the negotiations  but it is a
misrepresentation to say that a "first peace agreement' has been
reached. It is procedures which has been agreed on by both parties,
subject to change and far from a substantive theme such as a proposal
to reduce military tensions, something which would do a great deal to
re-establish the confidence of the EZLN in the dialogue. Progress is
visible however in the apparent willingness of the government  to
discuss "national" issues with the EZLN, although a specific proposal
from Zedillo was at one point refuted by his own negotiator, Marcos
Antonio Bernal.

The strategy of low-intensity warfare however remains the choice of
the Mexican government and is a preference for the Pentagon as well.
It remains a war of nerves, a war against civilians, a war which the
state-party system continues to wage with impunity.  After the
massacre of 18 campesinos in the state of Guerrero, its people called
for the removal and indictment of the governor.  The PRI announced
there is "insufficient" evidence.  As the elections in Chiapas
approach two incidents in the villages of Tila and Nuevo Limar have
left 4-5 people dead, and dozens of houses burned to the ground by PRI
members and the local police.
The violence promulgated by profound poverty, centralized
authoritarian rule and government-sanctioned repression has not
ceased.  In spite of dozens of government proclamations for peace,
there is little change except cosmetic gestures of reform.

Most of the people of Mexico know this.  At the grassroots, in rural
and urban communities, a fierce, implacable determination grows, a
patient faith, a hope which burns and spreads in spite of all the
propaganda, the terror and the manipulation.  Indeed a process has
just begun.

**********************************************************************
*****************************

To  show  our  support for the Zapatistas the National Commission  for
Democracy  in Mexico, USA has a made a call for "An International  Act
of  Resistance in Support of Democracy in the Americas" for October 9-
12  in  Washington  D.C.  The Act is also a call  to  demonstrate  our
outrage  at,  and  rejection of, the neoliberal policies  of  the  PRI
government,  promoted and supported by the government  of  the  United
States.  In addition the Act is a call to express our support for  the
civic  society  which has committed to struggle  for  the  16  demands
proposed by the EZLN and for a dialogue with respect and dignity  that
would create the possibility of a Mexico that is genuinely free,  just
and democratic for everyone.

The fact that the United States government and financial interests are
directly  manipulating events in Mexico implies  that  they  are  also
responsible  for the misery and deaths of the people of  Mexico.   The
participation of the United States in maintaining millions of Mexicans
in  subhuman conditions implies  that those of us who live  here,  who
believe   in   justice,  liberty  and  democracy,  have   an   immense
responsibility to struggle and mobilize against this policy of  hunger
and death.  We can not allow the liberating light that shines from the
mountains of Mexico's southeast to be extinguished.

To do this, we ask that you make every effort to join us October 9-12,
in  Washington,  D.C. in this historic opportunity to stand  with  the
Zapatistas, and to let those in power know that reason and a  peaceful
transition to democracy must remain a viable alternative in Mexico.

Subject:      spike it with saussure - begins the intramix...

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books. And flew
through windows '95 Marlin Loins lightning green, a fine morning
First detrevni whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the old boy on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endless, an obtuse cellar blue, it binds
The caravan of endowments to what they flee
These space curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Boloed than aware, spin-art and pebbling
but narrow in the face or foppish Sunday Hilda oh! Airy
Hemp Lush over coffee copped a kiss, the Times blowing
& opining, heavy humid air, we musing against the
bleached ribcage ripcorded into compassed wind
missing the violinist between her rests as she
indexes fracas problem: tool shacks, landscape of
Zorro son of thunderhead and the storm in the steel glass
s halfway pertinent incision we keep making
(I denied not knowing how cadenza was meant) &
Neapolitan pockets in small furniture intended house
chance several mountains away but it wasn't, you know, a
big tango when the attorney general came, said amen,
"Dias,oh, ho kook!"Xanthippe Ellington! "Tootin' Through the
Roof" Tobacco warehouse, curls no rabbit rabbit rabbit rabbit
texture so to speak was at the  cleaners hot and
stubble somewhere unnoticed, chirping presence
the chair is sad, alas, Inroad Mama, i've lusted tootles' livers
the
detour a cello a day dishevels a boat cold otter chose in the
core
slaughter because we're waiting all throughout
eternity for solos to be of such suchness - Relaxed
Renal Scar in the nooks were creams and in the stream were hooks
All models like films about their friends in pastel
of darkness falling like an afghan around the manatee.
Likewise seems sandpaper huckster with seesaw inchworms and
recently soft brute of subject's object status, violent
transformation la Ste. Therese into beaming cumulus hapax
switchback and in the u-turns were bookmobiles rounding angels
considered shrill as I'm left in the acres to be aging
flutes sing fender-benderless in trio, h-h-h-holy cow!
effort really is or is not, fast enough to sleep
through thunderstorms, arm over thigh until light shakes
petals free of names that rain across known skin forgotten
alive in our hearse hurts, projective nurse if she is to go ahead
And, with a shout, collecting coat hangers
Groin Going Boo saunters pentecostal, operator will you cockpit
out, transplanted organs speak, "arf!" the idiom
inseams, a snare as solvently unequal-- the power
uncreased although each snare still trembles QuarkXpress
which explains why the sump is busted and why
he preferred Hole to afternoons on the phone with that
carp, a cousin on the moon, remember the needy
capable of keeping the canoe right way up in the cool
prose of the upper Hudson, dinner's at seven so
start swimmin, bud: "lay me down in a wetsuit,
heats me up the porridge," it's like a huge typo
of familiarity. I am storing valence for later use
I know the war-whoop in each dusty arrogance
among the choruses and the different people
Char, Lee, Parr, Kerr, everybody is Hokey Pokey
collecting the very boring nouns that come in on the breeze
delicate lace flies tied by Pelican Bill, yo, in the house,
of narration with part of good moisture. Here, bile, sopor,
ebullience is a token gesture of the sauced, Red Stuff.
I have a lot of duodenum. In the freezer we can defend some
woods on a snowy evening, my yellow rose is lovely dark and deep
as penitence, but let's elude the shakes and drear, get lost in
our palaver. Have? Will not a binge of harmony which
in the end go "meerschaum" on us till we Tempest ourselves to
bearings where the heiress is cows bathing in starlight. Give
the poor temp a rest, for widest space succombs to onslaughts of
hidden porchlight in the platitude that she has given his
longitude. Depth is directly stated. A signal slated to be
canonized
elevates politicos and blond ones also raving vortices but
does hang-gliding exist or is the circle a bulb of "plus"
expenses
cabins away from "Flash and Filligree" and "Goat's Head Soup"
travel stiffly by the tears for so many tendons
documentary to mean full body winter with alcohol removed
sending the bulk of closure with sentient loops
but my nerves are excellent tonight: Check Sire
in the coin-op kiln on Sullen Street with my Saint Chris

1) Quote only the last two or three previous lines of the Renga to which
you are adding.

        -- with a little *local* editing you would be able to keep complete
copies on your own machines, and this will leave the list a *lot* less
cluttered for the rest. [Remember, some of us pay for access to the net.]

2) ? Strict(er) use of subject lines to identify branchings.

The process, with its weird time delays and multiple branching almost every
line is certainly fascinating  -  perhaps particularly for contributors.
But then so are snapshots of that process. What I like about the 'ringa'
(as in ringa the changes) are its morphabilities.

And 'punblic somain' is my nomination for typo of the week btw.

I've now heard from Romana Huk, who is organising that conference at the
University of New Hampshire I mentioned before, on contemporary
UK/Irish/US/Canadian poetry. She's asked me to say it'll take place on 28 Aug -
2 Sept 1996. Anyone interested in hearing more should contact her at UNH, Dept
of English, Durham, NH 03824, tel 603-862-3992. She has  some problem with her
email at the moment but once she's online she's hoping to subscribe to this
list.

Subject:      David Ayre's rengas

Last week, as you may recall, David Ayre promised to post, what was it,
54(?) pages of rengas. Always a man of his word, in the last few days, Ayre
has done just that.

What I want to know is: how (& why) did he use so many different names and
email addresses to post this remarkable flurry of rengas?

& why has he dropped the convention of keeping the word "renga" in the
subject line for those (fools though they may be) who do not wish to read
more rengas?

Daniel, thank very much for your concern. I am looking into Rengaholics
Anonymous --there is a chapter here in Buffalo. I believe some of the
members are former poetics list subscribers. I am about to contact Mike
Boughn to see if he can give me some free counseling.
But Sheila, no matter what happens, i promise to keep our excellent

Enryque, you were joshing yea, but for me it's, joshing, the point, to
write a line that cannot be written past and that at the same time
asks you invites you to try with everything you may find.

That would cut down on the numbers of em, too. I'm
antiellipsoidal - sorry, translator. The translation has got to
be total. But their quantity by soloists -

If fewer posts were posted each day from each, then this would ease the
pay-per-line situation, and also alleviate the occasional clog
that the listserv owner has had to roto-root for us - talkin
about paying for the service! 50 different posters each day would
mix well in a punbliquity of unanimous outrage.

Of course it seems that explicit rules are anathema to the
implicit rules of this listserv that constitute it as it is, so
no doubt these suggestions as with every other are simulateously
asking you to not write past them and inviting you to do so with
everything you find at hand - the keyboard body. You've got a
keyboard body, it could be rad.

Steve, thank you for your Adorno quotes. The lectures on Hegel as
a poetic for modernity, can you expand the analogy? As Butler
speaks of girling the girl, we need to enverb Adorno and Hegel.

I put a version of the renga thru grammar check, which kept politely
suggesting that various parts of it did not seem to be complete
sentences. I told it there was no such thing in this people's
universe, and it compromised with this:



In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows  lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The caravan of windows to what they flee
These lace curtains, more gauze than bondage, more
Mollycoddled than aware, thin-spondee and pebbling
but narrow in the waist or waspish Sunday years ago
Over coffee topped with whipped lads, the Times blowing
& opining, heavy humid air, cum amusing against the
bleached ribcage ripcords into compassed wind
kissing the weatherman between her beasts as she
gives gracious problem: fanatical snacks, landscape of
flicker son of thunderhead and the storm in the glass of water's
halfway pertinent incision we keep making safe for ignorance

sequentially several mountains away but it wasn't, you know, a
big tango when the attorney general came, seal hales said,
"Dias,oh,ho kook!"Edward Kennedy Wellington! "Tooting' Through the
Roof" Tobacco warehouse, curls no ideas but the woven fabric the
texture so to speak was at the dry cleaners piping hot and
gloved-in somewhere unsalted, perched on prescience
the chair is sad, alas, and Ive lusted toothless' livers the odor
day toy a cello day dice chivvies a boa coo daughter chose encore
Flaubert because we're waiting all throughout
Eternity for moments to be of such sauciness.
In the nooks were creams and in the stream were hooks
All melded like striated film leftover in the pastel seeds
Of darkness falling like a counterirritant around the manchineel.
Likewise seams sandpaper juxtaposed with seasoned instruments and
recently soft fruit of subject's object status, violent
Transformation la Set. Theorize into beaming cumulus apokoinu
switch back and in the u-turns were bookmobiles rounding angles
considered shrill as pine left in the acres to be aging
flawlessly, flutes sing gendarmes in trio, surprised by how quiet
effort really is or is not, fast enough to sleep
through thunderstorms, arm over thigh until light shakes
petals free of names that rain across known skin forgotten
alive in our hearse hurts, projective nurse if she is to go ahead
and dance, composing instead of straining muscles, far eyes
saunter lope Pentecost beam operator will you cockpit
out, transplanted organs speak, the idiom
inseams, a snare as slovenly unequal-- the power
uncrossed although each snare still trembles quantum
which explains why the pump is busted and why
he preferred whole afternoons on the phone to that
crap about not having a cousin on the moon
capable of keeping the canoe right way up in the cool
prose of the upper Hudson, dinner's at seven so
start swimming, bud: "lay me down in a wet suit,
heats me up in the sleaze," it's like a huge dose
Of familiarity. I am storing radiance for later use
I know the war-whoop in each dusty narrative
among the invoices and the difference engines
Char, Lee, Pap, Keg, everybody is here and there
collecting the stamp hinges that come in on the breeze
delicate lace flies into pelican Bills in the house
Of narration with partners of good moisture. Here,touch my
Ebullience with a token gesture of sauce, of the red stuff.
I have a lot of Dundee in the freezer & we can defrost some
woods on a snowy evening, my horse is lovely dark and deep
as penitence, but let's elude the shakes and drier, get lost in
our palaver have tongue will travel not a binge of harmony which
in the end goes meerschaum on us till we blink ourselves to
Creeping where the sublime is cows bathing in starlight. Give
temporality a rest, for widest space succumbs to onslaughts of
hidden porch light in the latitude that she has given his
Longitude. Depth is directly stated. A signal slated to be read
ingratiates politicos and blond ones also shaven vortices but
does mangling exist or the circle is bleb plus expenses
cabinets away from lust and pedigree and shark fin soup
trailing stiffens buying tears for so many tendons
demitasses to mean full-bodied wine with alcohol removed
by trained leeches from under the rotting elastic, a feast
of swirling eddies with beau coup of labia & confetti
starving time's scythe for water, matching colors to go

I had to go off for a few days and while I was gone the explanations
of who wrote the renga have thmselves taken on a renga-like
proliferation. As soon as I can sort out what I have been told I will
post what I have figured out so that people can make additional
claims or else ask not to be included.

I wonder who was the first person who brought a piece of kudzu from
Japan--just a random thought.

I do realize that the renga is an ongoing process and that anything
printed outside this list is reportage rather than publication. But
it might set an example that would help make so-called "workshops"
more fun. Despite its oriental model it seems to me a very new world
thing, like roof-raisings and potluck suppers.

Ha.  And what would that kind of reading be?  Yes, I have to agree with
Ed that HD is probably the most important of them--ep, hd, wcw--at the
moment, but wcw is (partially) important in american poetics (if I can
hazard such a generalization) because of his mainstreaming of an
avant-garde aesthetic.  Maybe the wheelbarrow is a little boring, but,
geez, it's neat isn't it?  I mean, I see Emerson and Thoreau in him . . .
and I always dig that.  As I suggested, though, I am interested in WCW
for not only the clarity and and simplicity, the laconic reduction of
language to its essentials, which still retains such resonance and
suggestive possibilities, but, also, because of his investment in an
avant-garde, modernist tradition.  HD and EP do not, I believe, offer
that same perspective.  I am interested in the WCW of Spring And All--the
prose/poem version, with its absurdity and weirdness.  Where else in the,
now, mainstream tradition do you find that?  Eliot doesn't count--expat
and all.  What is valuable is WCW--were we in need of qualifying this--is
that he, not single-handedly mind you, reoriented american poeticx:
"Writing is not a searching about in the daily experience for apt similes
and pretty thoughts and images.  I have experienced that to my sorrow.
It is not a conscious recording of the day's experiences "freshly and
with the appearance of realilty"--This sort of thing is seriously to the
development of any ability in a man, it fastens him down, makes him a--It
destroys, makes nature an accessory to the particular theory he is
following, it blinds him to the world . . . . "  I would hazard to say
that without WCW american poetics would have lacked an important
influence in turning itself away from an ideology of verisimilitude.  If
we are to read anyone we need to read them in a way that makes them not
only part of their context but as how t        relevant to our present.
Better WCW than longfellow....

Our reading of the literature of the past is continuously refracted through the

sclerosis of the national heritage theme park, on the one hand, and the
instantaneous amnesia of MTV culture on the other.

WCW still feels like an outsider to me. I was told recently by someone brought
up in Paterson, NJ, that he was never taught Williams in English class, and
never heard about him until after he left school.

Subject:      Ranting on St Marks

For some time now I have wanted to buy a book by Zukofsky who I first heard
of on this list. A friend suggested St Marks as the best bookstore to find
him in. I called them up and was told they had a large selection. Fine I
said to myself, I'll go over there later tonight and spend some time
browsing.

I go to St Marks occasionally. Not enough to remember where everything is
located. However I found the poetry section and then I found the end of the
poetry section, where the X, Y's and Z's are. It runs into poetry
anthologies I believe. No Zukofsky from what I could see. So I asked the
grey-haired bearded man at the desk where I could find Zukofsky. "In the
poetry section," he growled. I tried again. Then I walked to the front of
the store to see if someone at the front desk could help me. No, it
appeared that guy was engaged in ringing up purchases.

So I said to myself fuck it, that guy should do his bloody job and help me.
I went to the desk again. I asked the bearded grouch in a polite voice if
he wouldn't mind checking his computer to see if any Zukofsky was in stock.

"Oh, for Christ sake," he said as he got violently up from his desk and
marched to the poetry section two feet away, "Just check the rack." Which
he did. Then he said, "We're out of stock." Which is what I thought but
wanted to be sure I hadn't missed anything. "When will you have him back in
stock?" I asked. "Not for a long time," he said.

At which point I had had enough, "When I called this afternoon I was told
you had all of Zukofsky on the shelves."

"We never carry all of Zukofsky," he said.

"Well!" I shrugged, threw up my hands and walked out in a silent rage.

On the way home I stopped in at the Barnes and Noble in my neighborhood and
picked up a copy of "A". No stress and no bad vibes. Simple, easy, polite.

Maybe the grey-haired bearded guy was having a hard day's night, I don't
know. But he put me off entirely. His attitude was rude, angry, ugly and
degrading.

Rather than compare St Marks to Barnes and Noble which is unfair because
they are in two different leagues, let me compare St Marks, with say, The
Gotham Book Mart. Now here is a bookstore that has never been anything but
polite, helpful and friendly to me. It is a bookstore I have used far more
than St Marks and will continue to do so. It has a literary history that
blows St Marks right off the map, with manners and sophistication to boot.
Never mind that things are slightly jumbled and out of order. Chalk it up
to charm.

By the way,from the little I read last night Zukofsky is engaging, and I am
sure that is the least of it.

A question. I believe Zukofsky wrote something about Shakespeare. A
critical essay or perhaps a book. Does anyone have the title and/or know
anything about it?

Take care

Blair

Louis Zukofsky's book "Bottom: On Shakespeare" was reissued by U of Cal
Press a few years ago, I think this edition is still in print.

This edition reissues only volume one of the original text. Volume two was
Celia Zukofsky's musical setting of Shakespeare's play "Pericles, Prince of
Tyre." LZ writes somewhere that CZ's rhythmic notation of Shakespeare's
text in this setting makes clear the ideas about Shakespeare he was writing
about. But then LZ also wrote that this dense and entertaining book could
be reduced to the logical formula <love is to reason as eyes are to mind>.
There's a lot more there, regardless of how relevant it is to these thesis.

In any case, even those of us who read music might quibble about the
discursive quality of CZ's music here. It isn't clear to me, at least, how
to get LZ's ideas about Shakespeare, Aristotle, Spinoza, & Wittgenstein
from CZ's use of, say, dotted quarter notes.

That said, CZ's music seems to be pretty. As far as I know the setting was
never performed.

don't have copies, give me dates so I can look up in library --

You may not recall ten years back when Yardley wrote a columnular whatsit

too bad about St. Marks.  There was a period in the eighties when it was
just amazing: small stock, but nothing you didn't want to buy & read; lots
of stuff not available or not prominently displayed in much bigger bookstores.

MIght be worth one more try before writing off.  Actually I always found
Gotham kind of fustian and annoying....

When I visited The Cloisters I asked the young woman behind the desk
why they didnt have copies of _Paterson V_ for sale. She said what
was that. I said a poem by William Carlos Williams, which causes
people such as myself, from the oppositer coast, to visit The
Cloisters. He's your great poet, I said. Never heard of him, she
said. She shda been working at St Mark's.

Subject:      Jonathan Yardley

When I first moved here, Jonathan Yardley was book-page editor for
what was then the Greensboro Daily News. He admitted repeatedly that
he simply could not read and did not understand poetry. In other
respects he was too intelligent and liberal-minded for some of his
readers.

Jon was especially enthusiastic about sports books. I once had a bad
dream in which he asked me to review a three volume autobiography of
Joe Garigiola, whose name I cannot spell, handing me a heavy volume
titled THE EARLY YEARS.

I am afraid that he has felt put down for years by refined literary
types and feels that poetry is almost pure pretense. I am afraid not
much can be done about it. When McDonald's serves quiche maybe
Yardley will like poetry.

Sad to say, but the only store here in Sacramento to carry any LZ is Barnes &

                                   of the
                         Ephemera Society of America
                          at Colonial Williamsburg
                              Williamsburg, VA
                             October 20-21, 1995

                EPHEMERA: anything short-lived or transitory

      The Ephemera Society of America is an organization committed
to the study of often-overlooked but culturally rich objects such
as lottery tickets, newspapers, trade cards, and travel literature
- to name but a few.  The annual symposiums of the society focus on
a main theme and include lecture sessions as well as activities
devoted to the study, discussion, and illumination of pieces of
ephemera as material culture.
      The society will hold its 1995 symposium in historical
Colonial Williamsburg, in Virginia, with the theme ``Job Printing
in America''.  Speakers from organization such as the American
Antiquarian Society, Library Company of Philadelphia, Yale
University, and Colonial Williamsburg will speak on topics ranging
from pre-1800 Virginia Ephemera, Benjamin Franklin's job printing,
chromolithography and the cigar label, and architectural vignettes
on commercial stationary.
      The event will feature a special torch-lit reception at
Colonial Williamsburg's eighteenth-century Printing Office by the
tradesmen who have dedicated their lives to the accurate recreation
of the book arts trades of colonial America. A demonstration of
papermaking, hand-press operation, bookbinding and gold tooling,
and the production of decorative papers will be held and symposium
attendees will have the opportunity to try some of these activities
first hand.

           ***** URGENT: Please respond by September 19th!!  *****

      Registration fee: $150 ($250 for couples).  This includes a
year-long pass to all of Colonial Williamsburg's many museums,
programs, and demonstrations, six formal lectures, tours of the CW
library and other historic sites of interest, and a banquet dinner
at the Williamsburg Woodlands hotel.

Yes Tom, I guess it is good to have a bookstore who has heard of Zukofsky.

It's also fine to be part of a list that discusses him. And I thank Herb
Levy for his most informative post.

I wonder how many other bookstores in New York carry Zukofsky? We know
Barnes & Noble does.

Perhaps if I had worded my inquiry at St Marks something along the lines,
"I called this afternoon and was told you had a selection of Zukofsky in
stock, but I can't seem to find him in the poetry section under Z," the
whole incident would have proceeded rather differently.

Bookstores are just as chickenshit as commercial radio stations, that's
what.  They won't carry anything unless someone can guarantee them X amount
of sales, and they won't take any chances without that guarantee.  Poetry,
of all types but always especially that poetry considered "avant-garde" or
"experimental",  has proven remarkably ineffective as a consumer good, since
you can't just consume it and move on (you have to live and grow with it),
so it doesn't fit well into the marketing schema.  Look for this trend to
get worse over the next few years, as wealth further concentrates in the
hands of fewer and fewer and bigger and bigger corporations.

btw, I got my Joris Celan translation at City Lights, but even that store
doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be.

In 1983, when I went to Rochester to teach for a year (but place is

that the shakes were 100% plastic, and the placemat on the tray tole me the

I appreciate the interest several of you have taken on the list, or
backchannel, on my letter rebutting Jonathan Yardley. Regarding Jorge's
request to post the letter, the letter itself does not provide that much
information that an audience like this on the poetics list needs--the
points it makes would be for you all pretty much obvious.

I will say this: Yardley's argument is threefold; there are no good
writers of literature in the U.S. right now. This is true because writers
have no interest in audiences. They have no interest in audiences because
their large academic salaries and huge arts subsidies make them
self-indulgent.

It is, of course, an argument typical of the desire to undermine arts
funding here in D.C.

The last paragraph of my letter reads as follows:

        The problem with Yardley is that he ignores literary culture on
the one hand and attacks it on the other. He is thus a perfect example of
the isolated, institutionalized writer he pretends to disdain,
responsible to a paycheck that comes not from any audience but from a
powerful media conglomerate. He is a critic who attacks what he doesn't
understand.

Thanks again to Carolyn, Jorge and others for their interest.

St. Marks used to be better than it is. Gotham's more than a bit
hostile to L. poetry, except as it relates to Black Mountain, etc.
schools (seems to me).

But on the plus side, the Upper West Side Shakespeare & Co. actually
had (has?) the Joris Celan *on display*!

And on a trip to Philadelphia a couple of days ago, Borders had: two
Coolidge, three Hejinian (I picked up THE CELL, which I find perfect),
one each of Raworth, Perelman, S. Howe, R. Waldrop, Jabes, etc.
Admittedly all Sun & Moon (but for the Perelman?), but still very
nice. Although their journal selection's gone down, whereas the Upper
West Side Papyrus had not only DENVER QUARTERLY & NEW AMERICAN
WRITING but also LINGO & the Watten issue of AERIAL.

So while it could be better, it seems to me, it could also be a LOT
worse ...

Subject:      Pergolesi

while the music chatter which has been on the list has generally
concerned itself with Hole and other fine artists, i thot there might
be a classical enthusiast out there who can help me place Pergolesi.
After seeing Baryshnikov's *White Oak Dance Project* the other night
i'm desperate to know if one would consider Pergolesi to be Baroque.
i suppose it depends on how you define Baroque.
Deleuze calls Baroque music "what can extract harmony from melody"
but having taken drama class over music class in my early
years, this is lost on me.

any takers?
cause my Amadeus Soundtrack booklet
doesnt help me much.

various things, jeffery, too much for here, but at least (1) unpack wcw's rhetoric: it trivializes much poetry. wcw "clarity" entails doing less, not better. (2) let's retire "avant-garde." see jackson mac low on this. it's a military line. -ed

as for emerson in wcw, yes, but reduced somewhat. thoreau, perhaps, in quality of attention. but rimbaud is the key, tho when he reached his paterson, he dealt in guns (true avant-garde) not medicine. wcw is less "american" than he'd think.

hadn't known about Yardley's previous incarnation yet farther south -- in
recent years he has sprouted an esitional, editorial column in addition
to his book review page -- and both are increasingly given to neocon
drivel of the most uninformed sort -- it's particularly depressing to
find a long-time book pager so freqently making negative remarks about
books he has not read --  It's one thing to profess an inability to "get"
a particular genre (as I, for example, just don't get grunge -- find it,
in fact, not that grungy) -- another thing to, as Yardley did (and David
McAleavey did write a letter to the editor which was actually published
explaining just what was found wanting in Mr, Y's logic at the time!) use
such powers as a page columnist has to promote the idea that "nobody"
knows what's good  in poetry anymore (sound familiar? a bit corny,
prehaps?) and that we'd all be better off just ignoring the stuff --
"esitional"?? try additional--

This was shortly after the LA Times had abandoned poetry reviewing, but
they did begin to publish a poem in each week's book review, and have
now, with no mention of their curious earlier editorial position,
returned to the reviewing of verse --

My one and only experience reviewing poetry for the _WAsh Post__ wasn't
encouraging -- they asked me to review books by Dove and Bronk -- which I
did -- they then typoed a line in the Dove review so that instead of her
line mentioning "gum popping" girls it read "gun popping" -- despite the
fact that they had changed my correct copy, the POST printed no
correction -- can't help wondering if the proof-reading gnomes at the
POST would have let such an error through if the line had made reference
to young white girls -- maybe I'm paranoid, but my old colleague Sterling
Brown used to tell his students "any black man who isn't paranoid is crazy!"

I have ever since dreaded meeting Ms. Dove for fear she will remember
this and think it my mistake --

Yardley loves the work of Peter Taylor, with reason, and despises the
likes of Don DeLillo, Joseph McElroy, etc. -- seems there is much he
can't read --

I hereby volunteer to write a weekly review for the _Washington Post_ at
half Yardley's salary --

I know of two recordings of Zukofsky that are commercially available,
Hank. One is a video recording, from the NET Outtake series from _USA:
Poetry_, produced by KQED in San Francisco 1965-66. It includes parts of
"A"-9, a section from "Catullus," a discussion of James Joyce, Whitman,
Pound and Bunting; I've seen it -- shown it at the Western Front here in
Vancouver -- it's wonderful; it's a half hour on 3/4" video, available
from The American Poetry Archives, The Poetry Center, San Francisco State
University, 1600 Holloway Ave., San Francisco CA 94132, tel (415)
338-1056. The tape is available for sale at $125 plus shipping & tax; or
for rent at $15 per public showing + shipping & tax.

There's also an audio tape from Spoken Arts, Inc., in the "Spoken Arts
Treasury of American Jewish Poets Reading Their Poems." The tape with
Zukofsky on it is Volume II, and also features Lenore Marshall, Stanley
Kunitz, Hy Sobiloff, and Karl Shapiro. Zukofsky reads "A"-12, "Spooks
Sabbath," "Songs of Degree," "Nor Did the Prophet," "As to How Much," "An
Incident," "The Record," "Song 22," and "Mantis." Write to Spoken Arts,
Inc., Box 289, New Rochelle, NY 10801. I don't know how much, but it's a
cassette tape; I doubt it's much.

Herb, a Vancouver group called the Cassation Group did some performances
of "A"-24 in the late eighties both here at SFU and at the Western Front.
So far as I know, it wasn't recorded at SFU unless the group did it
themselves; but may have been recorded at the Front; I'll try to check.

Ron, didn't a group including Barrett Watten do a performance in SF?

Best,

I still dont get Foster's point. Why is WCW dissed as boring because
he lived in an earlier time? Like, when do we cut poets off our
reading list? When trolley cars were no longer? 30 years after the
poet's death? Does a middling poet get points up because she can fog
a mirror with breath? I'm going thru my Earlier Collected Poems and
updating Williams's poems now. I have him driving a 1989 Toyota

Dear Tenney:

I may rant about St Marks Bookshop but it in no way means I will not
return, even though it may be some months before I do so. If, for instance,
I wanted a book by Bernadette Mayer, St Marks would be the first place I
would check, which may be a mark of my ignorance, I don't know.

That said, if I had been treated with a little more civility, I may have
stayed around, checked out, and possibly purchased other books in the
store, which would have benefited St Marks, the authors they carry, and me.

I should also mention that when St Marks was located around the corner, in
their old location, it felt better to be there. I congratulate them on
there expansion, but frankly, the new store doesn't grab me the way the old
one did.

Today I ordered "Bottom: on Shakespeare" from Gotham. They were quick on
the uptake, and I don't much feel like changing my position on them, but I
will say they did seem to rush me through my order. Maybe I had your
comment in mind.

Al Nielsen is kind to recall my earlier response to Yardley's earlier

Let's see just how bad my memory is. Bob Perelman, I believe, produced
a series of performances of "A"-24 in 1978. Steve Benson and Carla
Harryman also participated. My visual memory tells me that one
performance was at the Grand Piano, the coffee house series I ran with
Tom Mandel, but others I believe were done at SF State and UC Davis. I
recall being struck that the performances were more inspired than the
score (but the theatrical in LZ--and CZ--has never been my meat:
"Rudens" strikes me as the weakest section of "A").

One thing worth noting: the use of Handel made it impossible to perform
the text "naturally" (it goes too slowly to be spoken), which brought
forward the constructed nature of the language.

It was, as they say, a revelation.

Herb,

A-24 was first performed, I believe, by Harryman, Watten, Hejinian and Kit
Robinson in the early 80s.  I used to have a tape of it which I walk-personed
every day and night to learn the part of drama by heart.  I believe Brad
Westbrook, the curator at the UCSD archive for new poetry, got me the tape.
 Also, the SF State archive probably has a copy, as do the performing poets.


Anyway, he and I and two other folks (Becky Roberts & Chuck Cody) then
performed A-24, once to a piano at the Pannikin in Del Mar and once to a
harpsicard at Mandible Hall on campus, a few years after the high L-folks.
 Again, Brad is probably the best source of a recording of those pieces, as I
appear to have lost my copies . . .

SF State has both audio and visual recordings. The visual ones are from
Dick Moore's Poetry USA series. It was via this PBS series that I first
heard of Zukofsky, was blown away (totally!) by him and rushed out to
buy anything I could find at Cody's--which proved only to be the Robert
Kelly/Paris Leary anthology (a pretty great book after all these
years!), which in turn led to my first reading of Mac Low and a serious
rethinking of Spicer (with a far better selection than in the Allen)
and O'Hara's Biotherm in the smallest font size ever.

Subject:      Distribution or Bust

One of the few rules on Poetics@UBVM is that participants (lurkers and not)
are requested to post news of their recent publications, together with
information on how best to get these items.  It has come to my attention that
some of you are out-of-compliance with this "don't balk/must tell" rule.  The
fuller the listings (table of contents, etc) the better.  If you are a
publisher and editor and have new material on the EPC, it is still useful to
post it on Poetics as well, since many of the subscribers either don't have
Web access, don't use it, or don't check new listings.  This is may also be a
way to compensate for the recurring distribution and bookstore problems
discussed here.

On Bookstores:  Problem with the New York bookstores discussed here is that
even if they carry a new poetry book they rarely re-order, or re-order so
erratically that you can never count on finding a book, even a recent book, in
stock.  This is why the sales rep system is so crucial, since the initial
order of a new book is ultimately the one that will determine if the book gets
any bookstore life in New York at all.  So if you don't find a book, it's
possible that it was ordered and sold out; the books in stock are often the
ones that didn't sell.  In the 70s and 80s, when I used to pester these stores
to carry specific books and magazines, I always felt getting shelf space was
like getting a gallery show; "naturally" places like Gotham and Books & Co.
felt having the books in the store was enough, they certainly didn't have to
pay you for what they sold too!  (In my experience, St. Mark's always paid.
But they were the exception.)  At the same time, the real estate costs in New
York are so high that it is _probably_ not possible to survive with the sort
of commitments to poetry many of us look for in a bookstore; I say probably
because people do manage to figure out how to do improbable things, as any
number of our alternative poetry institutions show.

I don't buy books in New York, preferring to buy direct from the publishers,
or from SPD, but most often from Talking Leaves Books (which in turn buys them
from SPD).  Talking Leaves remains my favorite poetry bookshop and I have been
talking with the coop owners there about working directly with the Poetics
list and EPC: setting up accounts, taking order via e-mail, and so on.  So you
should be hearing more about that soon (though as they are understaffed and
have limited access to computer technology that this is taking longer than
they would like). (In the meantime, they are happy to take orders by phone or
mail: 3158 Main Street, Buffalo, NY 14214; 716-837-8554; fax--837-3861.)  As
has been noted by others on this list and off, bookstores like Talking Leaves
and Woodland Pattern are always in danger and need the same sort of support we
give to small presses and SPD and indeed other poets: we are all in it
together.

The Internet and the Web are becoming increasingly central for poetry
distribution, even if as yet many of the readers of the books often discussed
on this list are not on-line.  At this point, I see one of the primary values
of the EPC and the Poetics List as facilitating the distribution of print
books and magazines rather than (not as opposed to) making work available
electronically.  I see many parallels with the work I did on Segue's
distribution catalog in the 70s and 80s and the work on the EPC now.  We can't
afford to have the Net "replacing" bookstores, publishers and distributors
that support new and "alternative" poetry: that would be a net loss, indeed.
We have to find way to use the Net to help these institutions survive.  To
this end, listings and short reviews/discussions on Poetics of new work become
a mode of distribution.

About 15 years ago my continually new friend Cris Cheek prepared, on his
manual typewriter, an extensive list of UK small press publications, carefully
annotated with prices and address, issued as supplement #2 of L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E.
I'm reminded of that because the EPC and this list seem such a good place for
the sort of exchange of information and ideas among the UK, US, New Zealand,
Canada, and Australia.  And while we talk about the lack of information
between N. American poets and U.K. poets, it's been my sense that at least in
the particular world represented by those of us "here" that, in a small way,
this is beginning to take care of itself just as we talk about it.

I work in a store which carries pretty much everything in print by all of the
authors mentioned above (maybe not Coolidge, but we do have space
limitations, i.e. 12 of his books may be enough). By L.Z. we have Bottom, the
Collected Shorter, A, & L.Z.: Man & Poet. Borders buys in bulk, they made a
decision to sell SUN & MOON, not any of their authors. It's a question of one
person, in this case me, giving a damn & showing, over time, that poetry will
be supported when made available. The reason St Mark's isn't what they were
is they lost their small press buyer in '88. I'd still go there over Borders
or B.&N. no matter how grouchy the guy in the back is-- & I'm pretty sure
I've encountered him, similar vibe to the bartender at the Ear.
But are you REALLY a New Yorker if you're not creatively rude on a fairly
regular basis.  Back to business-- I think it's increasingly clear the
corporations are winning-- we'll all be making $4.26 an hour soon enough.

Of course you're right that they know he'll make some mainstream readers of
fiction/poetry mad, but I can't imagine them hiring say, Angela Davis, or
A.L. Nielsen for that matter, to write on literature just because they'd "get
attention."

For those curious abt the store mentioned above:
it's Bridge Street Books, 2814 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20007.

Hank -- if you go for the _Treasury of American Jewish Poets_ get the whole
set --
it also includes Stein and Reznikoff on other tapes in the set -- well
worth having to listen to the likes of Hy Sobiloff to get to these!  The
set was originally distributed by Spoken Arts Inc. -- but is also
available through other distribution agencies -- also worth your while is
the Watershed Oppen tape, circa 1979 -- some univ. libraries have these
tapes -- so look close to home before buying --

well, you may recall that the tracks were all ripped up by the tire

major cities everywhere are re-introducing the trolley -- just when you
thought it was good only for getting tourists from one quaint photo op to
another!

Not that you'd want to _live_ on a trolley -- but it will get you where

Subject:      Dangerous poets?

    In the 9/18 _New Yorker_ David Remnick asks (re: Ben
Bradlee) "Who is interested in a 'dangerous' editor?"
Dangerous here refers to not fitting in with the blandness
and sameness of co-opted commercial media.  While
I do have my own thoughts on this, I would be interested
in thoughts on:

What is a "dangerous" poet?

Who is the last one we've had?

Has that person had an effect on the way we live (or don't live)?


Possibly also of some interest in re: _Post_ ?review?

I wonder who else has picked this up while I lay sleeping...

Pergolesi (1710-36) certainly lived at the time of "high baroque"
composition, and yes, he outlined chordal (harmonic) structures in his
melodies - but who doesn't? It's damned difficult not to. I'd say that the
way he stripped down the counterpoint (one of the defininging elements of,
say, Bach Handel or Scarlatti) to a bare minimum, and supported his tunes
with almost Phil Spector block harmony, places him closer to the early
classical composers.

Who in fact rated him very highly, years after his death. People tell me
that the claims made for his "Stabat Mater" are extravagant: but to hell
with them - there's a brooding, melodramatic religious depth in it which
I'm a sucker for, and which you don't get again until Mozart's big c minor
mass (also driven by Italian opera) at the end of the eighteenth century.

Of course, there's a lot of other stuff which doesn't fit that pattern -
early work (! in a very short career) and chamber music which are far more
run-of-the-mill. I seem to recall there are some concerti grossi which
have just been ascribed to him which Vivaldi would've killed for...

Borders and B&N are sucking the life out of the other bookstores here in
chicago.  In the last month, I think three independent stores and one chain
(Crock's & Bretano's) have gone under.

For almost anything I want, I go to 57th St. books and the Seminary Co-op.
Their selection of poetry isn't always the greatest, or evenly distributed
(two weeks ago I saw a shelf that had about ten different titles by for too
and about Ginsberg, one title by Ferlingetti), but they are always helpful
and have never taken more than nine days to deliver something I've ordered.

Good question, but probably not very relevant in the U.S., where writers
don't pose a real political or social threat the way they do in some other
countries. Poets here are dangerous only to other poets.

Subject:      Distribution 'R' Us

Two short thoughts on distribution:

Even in a city without a store like Woodland Pattern, Talking Leaves,
Bridge Street, it still makes sense to find an independent local store and
order through them.

Any small book store needs the business, even if they don't specialize in
poetry. &, eventually, they will start to be more adventurous. Last week
when I went to order the Joris/Rothenberg anthology I was told "Oh, I
thought you'd want that when I saw it from the rep - I ordered a couple for
stock too." Granted they'll never have the depth or breadth of a specialty
shop, but they've learned that they can sell some things they didn't know
about before, & that's the only way independent book stores can stay in
business these days. & it beats going from Borders to Tower to Barnes &
Noble, trying to second-guess this week's corporate policies any day.

Another thing that can increase the distribution of "this kind of" poetry
is to make purchase requests at libraries.

They won't buy everything (& the selections can seem frustratingly
arbitrary), but library buyers are overwhelmed with options & frequently
just need an excuse to make a choice. If few people are requesting books
(&, even at academic libraries, most people don't), you could make a real
mark on a library's poetry collection. The University of Washington, where
I just have an alumni borrowers card buys two-thirds to three-quarters of
what I request, even though there's rarely any courses that deal with any
of it. If everyone on this list did this, it'd increase sales by a
significant number of copies & make the work available to lots more people
without costing anyone "here" anything but a little extra time once a month
or so.

specifically, burt: we are told the passage comes from wcw: ok, in that case, we have to ask, now, why "nature" [whatever that meant, then] should not be "an accessory to a particular theory," why not be "blind" to what wcw called "the world"?

Herb,
As Ron & Bill say, A24 was performed at the Grand Piano
coffee house in SF, at SF State for the Poetry Center, and
at UC Davis in a small recording studio. I don't know if the
Grand Piano gig was taped. The SF State performance was
videotaped, but the best performance & recording was done
at UC Davis. The cast:

Bob Perelman - piano
Barrett Watten - poem
Lyn Hejinian - story
Carla Harryman & Steve Benson - play
Kit Robinson - essay

I wonder if the American Poetry Archive has a copy of the
UC Davis tape. Laura?

in fact there is another Louis Zukofsky videotape kicking about and it is

Hugh Kenner I believe had invited Zukofsky to read and here is the record
of him reading, I believe A-22 and -23... as a video, regretably, it's
not so good -- i.e., very wide shots and a table lamp w/ shade infront of
the camera... but as a document, it's good and the audio quality is also
good... i don't know anything about the availability but it's there...

Re: Distribution or Bust

Thanks Charles for reminding us lurkers that we need, at least, to keep the
basic information flowing.

Five Fingers Review 14, "Metamorphosis," is now available. The issue was
inspired by and is dedicated to the memory of Nina Iskrenko. Belated thanks
go out to Ron Silliman, Ed Foster and others for their postings just after
Nina died. She was a contributing editor for FFR and a dear friend as well.
No 14 includes a collaborative project Nina directed just before she died,
called the the Metamorphosis Project, in which she distributed a short
excerpt from Plato's Laws with "all the nouns lovingly crossed out" to a
group of Russain and American writers asking them to fill in the blanks.
The Russian contributors are: Nina, Sveta Litvak, Nikolai Baitov, Igor
Zhukov, Sergei Solovyev, Pavel Mityushev, Dmitry Vodennikov and Andrei
Vorkunov. The American: John High, Leslie Scalapino, Thoreau Lovell,
Michelle Murphy and Scott MacLeod.

The issue also features special sections by other contributing editors:
Writing from the UK edited by Fanny Howe, with work by Ken Edwards, David
Dibosa, Wendy Mulford and Drew Milne. A section of Native American / Mixed
Blood writing edited by Mark Nowak, featuring Diane Glancy, Kimberly
TallBear and Eric Priestley. C. D. Wright and Forrest Gander introduce
writing by two younger writers, J. L. Jacobs and Mallory Tarses
respectively. Rounding out the issue is a section of new poems by Ivan
Zhdanov translated by John High and an interview with Zhdanov conducted by
John High.

Other contributors are: Jon Davis, Sally Doyle, Evgeny Laputin trans.
Vitaly Chernetsky, H. E. Francis, Craig Czury, John Olson, Gordon Lish,
Mark Mirsky, Ezra Mark, Elizabeth Robinson, David Hoefer, Larry Fondation,
Lawrence Fixel, Stephen Ratcliffe, Annabelle Honza Clippinger, Stefanie
Marlis, Robert Fagan, Andrew Joron, Ray DiPalma, and Liz Waldner.

Subject:      LZ & bookshop chickenshit

"Bookstores are just as chickenshit as commercial radio stations."

Dear Steve (and all with bookstore complaints),

Here's a slightly crabby response from someone who worked the front lines
of
chickenshit-- having owned and run a bookstore for six years. I agree that
it is
irritating to rarely find one's literary tastes represented on bookstore
shelves. I agree that the situation is getting worse as time goes by. But
the
reason is not that bookbuyers are more disinterested in avant garde
concerns,
but that it is becoming a increasingly large risk, in our deflated
economies, to
maintain a stock that adequately represents even the major movements in
contemporary poetry and poetics, let alone off shoots, "minor" writers,
etc.
Booksellers are not plotting together to keep experimental writing out of
the
marketplace. They are stuggling under extremely anxious conditions to keep
their
businesses open. As Charles pointed out, overhead gets more and more
impossible
in the urban areas which have any sort of concentrated readership of such
books.
If a store does seem to have even a rudimentary stock of books you like, it
probably means that the shop is kept open by free labour, outside jobs on
the
owner's part, and almost definately some sort of martyred partner with a
banal
day job, who keeps the rent paid at home, and the fridge stocked. You can
imagine the burn-out rate of such a life. The point is, why trash even
small
efforts towards adventurous ordering? Why not patiently place special
orders for
Zukofsky, Ferguson, Bernstein, Doris, Celan, then make sure you actually(
and
promptly)  buy the book when it arrives? Why not inform your bookseller
about
reading communities who would happily buy sun and moon books, roof books,
tsunami books? Then make sure these people respect the economic outlay a
broke
bookseller is making, make sure money changes hands. Why not make group
orders
via your informal reading groups? If you teach, why not order through
independant shops?  If you are a tenured person with an income, why not buy
from
a shop instead of waiting for a complimentary copy to arrive in the mail?
Bookstores finally have to either close, or change their stocking policies
and
philosophies, for complex reasons. Many customers regard a shop that stocks
language poetry, black mountain, tish, objectivists, more like a museum or
a
community service, than a shakey business that desperately needs economic
patonage. Booksellers are often so worn out fielding calls from collections
departments that they can't spend alot of time teaching themselves about
poetry
movements. Its up to the customer who wants a good booksource to teach the
bookseller, help her build a relationship with alternative buying
communities.
The rent which shelters these formidable tomes you favour must be paid, the
space must be insured, the phone kept operative, even if the bookseller
herself
does live on someone else's generosity. Most bookstores are very happy to
special order, and if you multiply these orders, by ordering with friends,
then
the buyer starts to get the point. Here I am begining to repeat my theme, I
know, but in that business haughty individuals who deplore the absence of
their
personal canons are the (irritating) norm. Often the clerk you speak with
is not
the buyer, is someone working for minimum wage, or volunteering, and can't
be a
specialist in your area. Often the bookseller is too embarrassed to tell
you
that the book you have ordered is in limbo because an account has been
frozen or
terminated due to inability to pay. Under long term duress, the protocols
of
concerned and attentive customer service can occaisionally wear thin. Only
a
committed and patient community can keep a good shop open.

On that note I would suggest that all Vancouver list subscribers rush to
Black

It's a kind of a bad teminology joke.  Baroque in painting sculpture
architecture town planning means a variable time/period-thing that's
hottest in the 17th century, but still going in some versions in the
early 18th in Germany and Austria. But music: that's altogether a
different terminology and even Mozart in the late 18th century is
sometimes called baroque (rarely & I suppose carelessly)though I must
say. Bach and even more obviously Handel coincide with what in
European decorative asrts painting architecture etc is usually called
Rococo. Forget the big old period terminology and its attempts to
find a few simple style characteristics to fit everyone into a time.
        French literature Baroque is late 16th century to early 17th
century and ends with the Precieux, maybe the death of Voiture 1648 wd
be a good date. The whole enterprise is deeply suspect. Personally
I'm more interested in way pomo readings of  much late 16th c and
early 17th c arts can be useful (which I refuse to say any more about, because
it's the same old game once more other than in a three volume
encyclopaedic book).

        The Baroque as a term is about as useful as G1 when it comes
down to the reading/understanding/enjoyment or even on the critical
commentary on any actual works.

        Go Pergolesi, with your somewhere between Baroque and Rococo
even early classical-romantic harmony-melody!

Maybe USAmerican poets arent dangerous, but their novelists can be,

Thanks, Herb, for pointing this out. It is too easy to be cynical about
bookstores, yet so true that at least some of them can be influenced by us
when we actually buy books. I imagine there are several people on this list
who buy $500 or more (for some, a lot more) of books each year. To a
bookstore, that makes you significant, particularly when you figure it's
only a small percentage of Americans who ever set foot in a bookstore.

I even know of one case at a university where, during a rash of spending
cuts lasting quite some time, librarians could only order books which
faculty members had requested. Several librarians I've known have been
outstanding builders of poetry collections (far better than most literature
professors). I trust them with the decisions more than I trust the faculty,
for the most part.

Thanks for saying these various things, Herb.

I'm not sure why I'm pursuing this . . . I thought we trashed over WCW
months ago?  Anyway, the passage--if it's the one I posted--does seek to
question a way of speaking; specifically, a poetry that emulates the
real.  WCW was after the shape of the imagination--as vague, mind you, as
Nature, but specifically attempting to free poetry from the constraints
of an inherited romantic tradition binding verse to the depiction of a
natural world.  WcW (wCw; W2C?) was . . . questioning the validity of
this way of writing. And, again,(especially if we are to pursue this any
further) I ask: where would we be without this influence?

In uk universities book-buying budgets are so tight that it's not uncommon
for all library selection to be delegated to faculty. The result, in my
experience, is that collections are always lagging behind current academic
interest because they are reacting to demand, rather than understanding it
and preempting it. Also, collections fragment as each individual pursues
his/her own concerns, and the "linkage" areas fall by the wayside.
Smallpress buying, it goes without saying, also falls away.

Having a librarian involved in selection doesn't fix the basic problem
(lack of resource) but it should mean that selection has a broader base,
and can react to wider interests (as long as these are expressed, and
don't remain at the sudued muttering stage). Gently, I'm starting to
squeeze a little more smallpress material into Durham...

Subject:      Dist. or Bust (i.e., New Book)

Well, I have to fess up. I just received 9 boxes of my new book _Ruin_.
But if my silence on the publication of this book weren't egregious enough
quietude, I am also the publisher.  - what books -  is the name of my
press.

Upcoming from what books is a book by Thad Ziolkowski titled _Our Son the
Arson_, due sometime at the end of the year. I hope in the next year to
publish one or two other collections and a recalcitrant anthology I've been
working on for a while. I aim to publish two or three books a year by
writers who are just outside the loop. what books is not an effort to bring
writers into the loop-as-such, but to see if there can remain for at least
a while a notion complicit autonomy. There is a big cusp.

As to my book, I have had luck doing the consignment hustle in NYC - St.
Marks had one copy last I heard (two were purchased there by friends) and
Tower's consignment buyer wants more. That's pretty much the extent of my
distribution to date. Now I have 750 copies...

If anyone would like a copy  (or copies for thier book store shelves) you
can reach me here, preferably back-channel, or at PRPhillips@aol.com. I
would be glad to send you one. I know that some of you are strapped for
cash (or couldn't bear the sight unseeness of it,)  I will be giving away
some copies, so if you would like a copy (for barter, trade, or donation
and postage), please send me your mailing address and I'll gladly send you
one.

I would also be very glad to hear anyone's comments on SPD and "other"
distribution methods. I would also like to know people have luck hoofing
into other stores in the Boston/NY/Philly/DC area with thier books, or
which stores are particularly open.  Julianna, or Rod, do either of you
have small press info? Lisa Robertson, what is your view of the viability
of quite small "indi's" in the small press slump?

 (1) unpack wcw's rhetoric: it trivializes much poetry. wcw "clarity"
entails doing less, not better.

This is probably the concomitant danger of the attempt to poetize trivia, to
champion "simple everyday speech."  Certainly when WCW's effort fails, the
trivia stays trivial and the poetry joins it.  But honestly, Ed, are there
no moments in WCW when something trivial achieves a shining presence through
Williams' treatment of it?

 (2) let's retire "avant-garde." see jackson mac low on this. it's a
military line.

...which has been incorporated by the fashion industry.

Thank you, Lisa, for a little breath of un-self-centered air in this
discussion.  As co-owner of one of the world's smallest bookstores, I can
corroborate the sad truth that invoices must be paid whether the books on
them have sold or not.  And the effort to balance what will sell with
what I wish would sell, what I'd like to be surrounded with, is in itself
a career.  When a customer asks for a book I don't have--or a whole
category of books I don't have--I always respond by offering to place
an order.  Usually the disgruntled one can't be bothered.

And one more thing--bookstore owners have venues of our own, where we talk
about our customers the way you are talking about us.  That's the reason
there aren't more assaults in bookstores.

Chickenshit? Oh, I thought it said "chickenship" & read it through twice
looking for an anecdote about Spicer in a vancouver bookshop.

Even so, I want to reiterate Lisa's suggestion that Vancouver folks support
Black Sheep Books. They did a great job of stocking their tables at
BlaserCon.

I only wish I was in Vancouver more often to spend more money at such a
responsive shop. Maybe when I'm up there to hear Derek Bailey & company.

&, thanks to everyone for the information on various Zukofsky video/audio
tapes.

last truly dangerous poet I met was a drunk at the Red Lion who used to
leave threatening messages on my answering machine -- since moving West I
haven't encountered another --

BUT, in the sens in which the question was offered --

commercial publishing and its yardley appendages have done a good job of
convincing everyone that American poets are clawless (perhaps even
clueless), merely pawing over one another --

there is, however, always a however,

most of us in fact know of one or two people who aren't publishing poets
who occasionally read poetry

whether any poets are truly dangerous or not, the US Govt. seems to worry
about some of them -- check out Baraka's FBI files and you'll be
surprised how many of his chapbooks were purchased by Hoover's literati
for closer examination

the MFA establishment, whoever and wherever that might be, certainly goes
into a tither the moment anyone suggests hiring a poet unlikely to get on
TV with Bill Moyers and loosing same upon the creative writing students
-- I've observed this phenom. at several colleges in recent years -- &
read the AWP newletter if you think Yardley is the most outrageous and
paranoid of our denouncers of poetics these days --

The reactions of both FBA and MFA agents are, naturally, out of all
proportion to real threat --

I think Bersenbrugge endangered a number of my own assumptions about line
-- and I have been trying to understand what that means ever since --

rereading Russell Atkins was a clear and present danger to much that I
had been taught about postmodernity, and I'm still mulling that over

No novel is safe in the vicinity of Lyn Hejinian or Leslie Scalapino

And Williams is still, I believe, more dangerous than the "light rail"
now installed in San Jose, which has claimed fifteen lives during its
short existence.

I don't think H.D. represents a clear and present danger (though I love
her, the novels especially) -- but Moore's scalpel is deadly if you let
her get close --

Have any poets changed my own carriage?

To this day I will not read Niedecker in a dark room by myself --

I've back-channeled a few people about both Zukovsky and the A-24 tape,
but was hesitant to post to the list as it would be difficult to respond
to many requests for the tapes all at once. The Poetry Center and American
Poetry Archives here at SF State taped the performance of A-24 that was
done here. The date I have for it is 11/15/78. I don't believe I have
releases from all of the performers (everyone's list of them was
accurate) to sell the tape, so it is distributed only as a library tape for the price of membership ($20) in The Poetry
Center. We also have the outtakes from the NET series Poetry: USA,
including the Zukovsky program. It is 30 minutes, a very interesting tape, which
sells, as Charles Watts indicated (thanks, Charles) for $125 and can be
rented for $15. I can be reached here by email or by phone (415)338-1056 Moday -Thursday.

Hi Kit, I wonder if there's anything else you can add to the discussion re-
A24 in performance. How did it work? What felt awkward, if anything, in the
tension between the music notation and the language notation? Would you
recommend that it's worth working on a performance of A24 - with
performance-writing students say? Any titbits of process, discussion that
spring to mind? Am I right in remembering that this production followed on
from several Poets Theatre performances, how did it feel to be working on
something that was not written by people directly in that 'group' of
writers and performers?

simply lots of questions  -  I'm curious to know more
love and love

where would we be? again: look at rimbaud, where wcw visited; it was there. but you'll find similarly, if differently phrased, positions in (oddly, given wcw's rejection) keats, moving poetry away from the ego (and representation, too). no?

as for "where would we be without . . . ," that's not the issue. it's whether we need a shift out of that tradition, put it in mothballs for a while (or that classroom, same thing).

yes, steve, there are moments when "something trivial achieves a shining presence," but it's still a way of seeing and a language that doesn't compel as much anymore. and curiously, moore does those transformations much better. dickinson, too.

Dear Lisa:

Thanks for the added perspective.  I thought that I was saying about
bookbuyers basically what you say about them, albeit from my own crabby
armchair.  What I meant by "chickenshit" was, in fact, more directed toward
the chain bookstores (and I don't think there's an anti-experimental or
-small press conspiracy there either), who don't want to be bothered with
patchwork distribution and return policies, smaller orders (it's easier for
them to order in bulk than 1 or 2 copies at a time), and so on.  I certainly
understand for smaller bookstores that there's a real (and legitimate)
anxiety about taking chances with their shelf space, and the suggestions you
and Herb Levy have outlined are excellent ones that I feel really stupid
about not going the extra step to mention before I posted.

It was not my intention to trash anyone for not stocking my taste in poetry,
and I used to work in (several) record stores, so I have been on the other
side of the counter and know what that's like too.
 We in S.F. have all but lost Small Press Traffic (it's relegated to 4 or 5
shelves in another bookstore at Noe and Market, a storage space in Colma,
and Dodie's reading series), and so we may have to learn this lesson the
hard way.

I'm not sure I can agree that WcW fails.  In fact, as my posts have
suggested, he is important because he succeeded so well at turning poetry
to the everyday.  If the everyday is trivial, well, then I too wish we
could live in the poems we all dream.  The everyday is not trivial and is
worthy of poetry.

We are, at the EPC, ready to mount a new service, the *Online

is based on the list of subscribers to Poetics) of people using e-mail
with Poetics interests.

As planned, the list will be alphabetical by name and will give an
e-mail address. The e-mail address will be highlighted so that when
you look up someone you can simply click on their address and send a
message to them directly from the EPC. (A sort of "active" directory.)

ed, et al: I toofind WCW boring. But it may be that I do because he is so
easily imitated. So, I sometimes find O'Hara, Ginsburg, Hejinian, boring for
the same reasons.
     Was it Picasso who said, very very roughly, "The most original art is
ugly. Then someone comes along and makes it pretty." I don't know
but can the term, or the concept, "boring" apply in the same way?

Darn it . . . drawn in yet again:  sure different positions, but doesn't
your statement assume that you can purge the "tradition" of WcW's
presence?  That we don't need him?  Sure, there were alternatives to him,
differently phrased positions, certainly, but you are arguing against
history here.  Rimbaud and Keats and WcW made different versions of
poetics available.  Just as you must deal with Whitman, you must deal
with WcW's influence (though admitedly on a whole different scale).  It's
not a question of substituting different versions of poetics for another
(though this raises an interesting question of just that possibility),
but, rather, of attending to the polyphony of different voices in
dialogue with each other.  Obviously, wcw is in dialogue with keats, etc,
rejecting him, what have you.  Perhaps WcW has obscured keats to us or
vice versa, but rather than simply deny wcw's influence or presence in
american poetics maybe we should be accounting for what he was writing
against (specifically) and how that has filtered our perceptions of him
and those whom he writes against.  I think Ed makes this point, perhaps,
though in three lines or less it must be difficult.  Yes, someone give Ed
more lines.  Please.  Most importantly, I am willing to go along with WcW
and what he was writing against.  If there were alternatives to his
version that were obscured by his canonization I'd be willing to
entertain thoughts on them.

Ed,
Could you spell out your position re WCW & his supposed lack of relevance
more clearly, (I *might* agree given a context)-- Not trying to start a
fight. The discussion reminds me a bit of Cage's remarks about
"masterpieces"-- that a masterpiece is something one continues to find
something new in, but that doesn't seem to hold true. Seems that we can
actually use up a piece of art. . . Is that (uh-oh) post modern? Is Duchamp
still "new"? If not what the hell is? Or is it a mistake to look for
something new? If WCW's used up, Olson must be to. Berrigan seems new to me,
but how describe. . . Is it a matter of attitude? of the poet &/or the
reader? bla bla bla?

It may be a sad truth, but the reality is that if Spring & All were
published for the first time today, it would still be the most
innovative and forward thinking book of the year, and would have been
so in any of the past 25 years. How we have gone from that to the
current norm of bland one-page abstract lyrics befuddles me....

In reference, I think, to the "dangerous" thread, Aldon deployed superb
wit in his reference to FBI/MFA agents.  I want to suggest, however, that
this situation is perhaps changing.  The academy has been infiltrated at
Buffalo, UC Santa Cruz and (?).  Here at George Mason's MFA program
(which has at least five subscribers to this list), I was able to bring
Rod Smith into the teaching fold, and in the past year and a half we've
had Susan Howe and Leslie Scalapino among the few two-day residencies we
can afford.  This fall, it's Rosemarie Waldrop.  A number of the
poet-grad students are writing linguistically innovative work and
frequent Rod's Bridge Street Books.  The student mag, -Phoebe- featured
work of interest to this list in the last issue.  I don't know what's
happening elsewhere, as I've always been somewhat isolated, but this
isn't a closed shop.  BTW, the new person at AWP's newsletter, The
Chronicle (also now based here) is a subscriber to this list, and would
welcome essays from any of you.  I'm not naive about that audience, so
why not begin with something on how to *read*.

Warmest regards,

How It Happened
for Ron Silliman

After centuries, it was finally clear--
We had lost it. But where did it go?
We asked the witch, hiding behind the television,
But she was only picking her nose. The validation
Had come through on the backs of stormtroopers
In plaid, but when we went to apply it
To our balance, some goons, it turned out,
Had hauled away our collateral in a wheelbarrow.
"No ideas but in love songs," said the radio,
And it went straight into all our poems,
Which were utterly, utterly up front
About the situation.

It's not a subscription type thing. You simply go to it and use
it.

When it's put online (next week I think), you can access it through
the World-Wide Web at the Electronic Poetry Center:

http:/writing.upenn.edu/epc

Follow the link for authors, then you will see a link to the

What Carolyn said. Yes, yes, yes, please. The only way to divert the
stream of commodified flush-left-first-person-narrative-(you know what I

To build off of what Carolyn has said is happenning at GM, I thought it
might be of interest to the list to know what's been happenning here at (the
dreaded) Writer's Workshops at The U of Iowa.

1)  The most single most requested poet in a pole of the the students
this semester for who they would like to see come and give a reading was
Michael Palmer.  So, he's coming in November.

2)  In the second year class (my class), out of approx. 25 students,
fully one third of them is working quite consciously in a "language" or
"avante-guard" tradition, and at least one-half (though probably more) of
the second year class, reads and is familiar and is at least partially
influenced by the "language" poets.

3)  Perhaps most interesting (and wonderful), however, is that next semester
(Jan.), Bob Perelman will be the visiting faculty member in the WS.  Talk about
infiltration....

SO, it seems things are changing all over, even at the most "established"
of the "establishment".  Faculty here are finding themselves having to at
least address "language" poetry in class.  In fact, over the summer in a
seminar in contemporary poetry, the teacher asked who the students were
reading and who they would like to discuss during the class, and EVERY
one of them mentioned an "experimental" writer.  I'm not sure what to
make of it...but I'm happy it's happening.

Apologies for all terms in quotes -- it seems silly to use them any other
way.

Best,
Brian Cassidy

hi guys.  tried to lurk for a day.  but timmon's thanks for adverting our
publications lured me out:  if anyone's going to the beat art exhibit at the
whitney in nyc, i've got a piece in the catalogue.  i tried to walk a fine
line between critique and appreciation, of course i'll be accused of
softpedaling critique or underappreciating, but hey, life's short, art's
longish but equally brutish sometimes.  so, now that i'm on aol i have more
sympathy w/ the renga-critiquers.  those yummy lines just don't look as nice
on the truncated screen aol provides, and the typeface is too big --i miss my
old account and its aesthetic-- but i love those wow lines jorge sheila et al
--did i miss something in transit about titling rengas "renga"?

Cris,

To answer some of your questions out of order I can't remember
everything but. . . . Most of the Poets Theater work happened AFTER
A-24. By '78 maybe only a performance of FOH's Try! Try! at the Grand
Piano (w/ Carla Harryman, Nick Robinson, & . . . John Mason?) and
maybe a short play by Carla &/or Eileen Corder had been done. The Big
Productions (3rd Man, Mister Sister, The Alps, Collateral, Particle Arms,
Under the Midwest, etc.) at Studio Eremos came later. As for A-24, yeah,
it was fun. A lot of hard work, intense rehearsals, trying to get the timing
right. I don't remember awkwardness, just the difficulty of staying on the
beat and still rendering the proper expression, not to mention dynamics.
As in theater, a marvelous way to get to know a work. And I think we all
enjoyed the experience of working in a group, especially as writers normally
don't (all rengae aside).

Building on what Aldon and Carolyn are saying about inclusion into a
let us say mainstream, I can't help but note in this context Hank Lazer's
essay in the recenet APR of Charles Bernstein (though the only poems
of Charles' I recall seeing printed there in the past have been, to my
mind, uncharacteristic of his work over all and more like the kind of
stuff one usually sees in APR--but then again maybe the journal is
changing, seeing as how it has such a large spread on Armand Schwerner who
is not a Language poet but whose work is by no means for the casual reader).

MFA programs may be the best recruitment agency yet developed for the
avant-garde (oppositional, experimental, pomo, multiculti, etc etc).
Due to its positioning among the academy, where some (few) folks are
beginning (just now) to question conventional modes of writing, workshop
type stuff (as it is stereotyped) seems more and more theoretically
bankrupt.
     The best poets feel this, and look elsewhere.But...
     The AWP is dead. Long live..........the AWP?
     We'll see. I know I have still go a very long way to go before
I can finally purge the workshop from my writing.
     Thanks, Eric.

Jail is interesting. The problem is you cannot get out, even when you are so
clearly in. This is probably less about poetry than it is about the list to
which you subscribe but which you cannot ever read because the machine will
not allow you to. (For machine read the form of the setting, or the setting
of the form.) Glad for the equinox. Best wishes to those who continue to read

And another book to announce.

Minnesota Center for Book Arts is publishing TALKING THE BOUNDLESS BOOK:
ART, LANGUAGE, AND THE BOOK ARTS. I compiled and edited the collection of
talks which were given at Minn. Center for Book Arts's 1994 symposium, Art &
Language: Re-Reading the Boundless Book. I wrote the introduction, and there
are essays by Dick Higgins, Johanna Drucker, Steven Clay, Charles Bernstein,
Susan Bee, Amos Paul Kennedy Jr., Byron Clercx, Alison Knowles, Jo Anne
Paschall, Karen Wirth, Katherine Kuehn, Linda Reinfeld & Toshi Ishihara,
Colette Gaiter, and Brad Freeman. The essays range from artists talking
about their own works and those which have influenced them, to pieces on
hermeneutics and the book arts, the economics of small press/poetry
publishing, the social efficacy of the book arts, and more.

The book will be available the second week of November. Orders are being
taken now by
Ann Somers
Minnesota Center for Book Arts
24 North Third Street
Minneapolis, MN  55401
612-338-3634

The price is $15.95. A $4 shipping/handling charge will be added as well.
D.A.P is distributing the book to bookstores, and they are a good art
publication distributor, so you should see it in at least some bookstores
before Christmas.

Unfortunately, orders can not be taken online.

If the center gives me a more detailed announcement, I may post again about
this before long.

Herb Levy and Zukofsky inquiries:

I didn't respond to my messages last night and I'm not through today's, but
I see that Herb Levy has thanked the list for the Zukofsky posts so I want
to stop my reading now and thank everyone as well. It would have been
better to say it sooner. I would also like to make a public thanks to Herb
who was so kind and generous to make the inquiries for me. I have all the
material and will see if I can get hold of a cassette or video.

Tenny Nathanson:

I congratulate them on their expansion
Whoops, that should be 'their' expansion
or "that there"
Ya.

Rod Smith:

If Gotham doesn't come through with Bottom I would love to get it through you.
They told me it would be a couple of weeks, so I'll be in touch with you then
and let you know whether they received it.

If the criteria for being a New Yorker, is being (creatively) rude on a
(fairly) regular basis, I qualify.

As far as the bearded man in St Marks, for some reason, I had the idea he
was the owner of the store. I don't know why. And I think I know the man
you are referring to at the Ear Inn and for some reason I have the same
thought about him. I think of him as the owner. It's an unconscious
assumption I have made, I guess, without a qualifying reason. Perhaps it's
the sense of authority they have, and I don't mean that negatively.

People with books:

I can see there are people who run bookstores on this list and I can see
that some of them are upset. I can only say that I have never had an
encounter in a bookstore like the one in St Marks, as far as I can
remember. I kind of think of bookstores as benign rather peaceful places.
Anyway ti's great to get all this info about where to buy books.
I should start a d base

Sorry I'm running late replying to this thread.

I am currently setting up a small press distribution network in Sydney
which will handle Australian small press stuff in the first instance but we
may well be able to take some os stuff after we get up and running. I'll
keep list members up to date. (we will also run stores at readings seminars
and the like and it may be possible to take one or two copies of o/s
magazines to sell on consignment that way - we'll see).

There have been a number of attempts to set up distribution networks in
Australia over the years. Most have them have fallen down because of the
distances involved. You really need to have staff in each capital city and
given Australia's small population and massive distances the economics just
don't add up. We are trying to overcome this by limiting ourselves to the
city and thye bookshops we know the best.

We will be also be setting up a virtual bookshop so a whole lot of
Australian small press publications should become available shortly via the
net.


regards

wcw isn't boring because he's easily imitated; i don't find cage boring, tho i can't imagine anyone easier to imitate. the "boring" i think has to do with being somewhere between formerly useful and not quite historical (or commonly read as "was).

well, jeffrey, i'd have to argue with "dialogue," too; there are poetries that are interesting to read that way, but essentially that's bahktin, who got tossed out quite a while ago. and in any case what's interesting is writing, not "about."

George, you have the dates right but the month wrong. The "greatest pianist
in the world" (tm), and poet, Cecil Taylor is in Seattle for a week (doing
a student workshop with no performance scheduled) in October, I think
between the 14-18.

I don't know how many poets are signed up for this, but, uh, perhaps this
is this still more proof of the opening up of the workshop.

Or maybe not.

Maria,

While any bureaucracy has its pull toward closing down the movements toward
energy, it seems as though the ripples can come from anywhere. When the
department holds its nose to progress, then build connections outside the
department. When the University suggests that it likes the way things are,
still nominate your most interesting students for the prizes. I am forever
optimistic that energy will have its impact on the bureaucratic system. I
am time and again the bureaucrat at Brown, putting the brakes on one or
another writers' great ideas (resources...limits...etc.). But we seem to
respect the need to let writing float into the atmosphere in as many ways
as possible. We have the great good fortune to have been founded by
sorts who have cosmpolitan/energetic ideas about literature -- and have
been able to sustain that tradition with new faculty hires. I'm sort
of the oddball in the mix (what is known here as a hybrid appointment, a
non-tenure-track administrator/teacher). The hours are frustrating, but
the environment is explosiv.

Pentium" Pro Processor Builds on Equity in Pentium Brand
  On Sept 19,1995 -- Intel Corporation announced that "Pentium" Pro
  processor" is the name for its next-generation microprocessor,
  previously code-named P6.  The 5.5 million transistor device will
  be introduced in the fourth quarter of this calendar year, and will
  be targeted at workstation and high-end desktop systems, as well as
  cost-effective servers.  The Pentium Pro processor will deliver the
  highest level of performance on 32-bit software for the Intel
  architecture.

 "By naming the next-generation processor `Pentium Pro,' Intel is
  building on the equity in the Pentium name while signifying that
  this is something beyond the original," explained G. Carl Everett,
  senior vice president, Desktop Products Group at Intel.  "Among
  target market segments, the Pentium brand has an awareness level as
  high as 95 percent, according to our research.  Intel believes the
  next-generation processor will benefit immensely from this
  association as we introduce it into the marketplace."

 The Pentium Pro processor is the first product of a parallel
  engineering effort undertaken by Intel in the early 1990s.  Its
  unique Dynamic Execution engine was conceived when today's Pentium
  processor was still a software simulation.  The compressed design
  cycles of new generations of chips have resulted in the delivery of
  some of the most powerful, low-cost microprocessors for a widening
  spectrum of uses.  For example, Intel was recently selected by the
  U.S. Department of Energy to build a 9,000-processor computer based
  on the Pentium Pro processor that will deliver 10 times the
  performance of today's fastest supercomputers.

 For more information on the Pentium Pro processor visit Intel's
  home page on the World Wide Web at URL http://www.intel.com/.
  Coming soon, those visiting Intel's web site will have the
  opportunity to create a 3D image rendered on a Pentium Pro
  processor-based web server located in Oregon.  For more information
  on the availability of the rendering machine, please subscribe to
  Intel's Pentium Pro processor mailing list by sending an e-mail to
  p6info-request@mailbag.intel.com and place the word "subscribe" in
  the first line of the body of the message.

Subject:      AWPAPRWCWS&A

Associate Professor of English, U. of Louisville
Phone: (502)-852-5918; e-mail: acgold01@ulkyvm.louisville.edu

On the AWP part, I'm greatly enjoying this mutual infiltration process (sounds
like a new technique for brewing coffee); Gwyn, Carolyn, Brian, thanks for
your recent posts, and it's good to have you as part of the conversation. I
appreciate the anecdotal information (who's visiting where, who's reading
whom, who's writing what)--for me it's simultaneously fun gossip, usable
information, and stuff that helps me as a teacher to start de-monolithizing
the institution of the workshop. (How's that for a neologism? No Bruce Andrews
action doll could do better.)


Burt K. mentioned Hank's APR essay. I actually think APR has always been a bit
more eclectic than it's given credit for, but its eclecticism has less the
quality of a commitment to multiple writing practices, more the quality of the
startled twitch that one gives when one is suddenly woken up. ("Oops, looks
like we'd better pay attention to this, even if we are 15 or 20 years late.")
To put this another way, it's not yet clear to me that we're seeing, in APR,
more than a kind of belated tokenism attached to one of the big names of LP.
Charles is acutely attuned to these institutional/literary-sociological
issues, it seems to me. I don't agree, then, Burt, that APR has published work
of his in a traditionally APR mode. The poems they've carried are, in my
reading, progressively more blatant gestures of resistance to and satires on
that mode. If the editors don't get it after publishing the last one,
"Memories," then I feel sorry for them. (And if they've already gotten it and
aren't letting on, then good for them.) The real test for APR will be to see
if they start publishing lesser-known or under-published "experimental"
writers, as they do with their flush-left-first-persons.

My last few years teaching incline me to agree with Ron about Spring and All.
Students consistently find it a revelation, "a place of first permission" in
Duncan's phrase. My problem with the recent discussions pro and con is that
they seem to depend on reifying "The Red Wheelbarrow" as somehow synecdochic
of WCW's whole practice. (Granted, one or two folks here and there mentioned
other poems.) There's perverse precedent for this. New Critical resistance to
WCW for decades was based on objections, repeated mantra-like in critic after
critic, to "The Red Wheelbarrow." But one of the many great things about S&A
is its polymorphousness, lost when it's reduced to a handful of anthology
chestnuts. When I read the first ten lines or so of Spring and All #9 ("What
about all this writing?") or #6 ("No that is not it") I hardly recognize the
poet of "The Red Wheelbarrow" (not so titled, of course--not titled at all--in
the original S & A).

Thanks to Carolyn and all who followed with the good news of incipient
change -- Mason & Phoebe were dead as Ed thinks Williams is back when I
lived in the area -- & any opening out of the AWP news is news indeed --
I was getting tired of that "theory sucks & nobody can read anymore" line --

I too had noticed that a cadre of students was begninning to show up on
campus actually asking to read people like Bernstein, Palmer, Hejinian,
Berssenbrugge   (of course, since I'd been playing the poetry of these
folk on the radio in hopes of creating such a demand, I can't claim to be
entirely caught off guard by this)

But we are mostly taliking about small inroads -- the reading program at
our campus is still firmly in the hands of a younger gurad with old guard
ambitions -- I have never been able to get _any_ body added to the list
-- Best I could do was get the guy to invite Mackey, who, living just
over the hill, didn't cost much money in travel -- but he wouldn't even
invite Nate till books from Cambridge & Coffee House & City Lights began
popping up all over the place --

With all this infiltration going on, maybe we will soon be the old farts
the new writers overthrow (perhaps with yet another return to
Williams?!?) -- not a bad fate to contemplate --

Subject:      Re: incursion / attaching to the host

I am glad to hear of Carolyn Forche's work at George Mason.
Intrigued too by the report from Iowa (& found that news rather
surprising).  Personally, I have been committed to such work for
quite some time.  Most recent results, the article on Charles
Bernstein in APR, and a section called "The Other South" in the
current issue of the New Orleans Review.

The APR essay was 40 pages in manuscript.  APR did not cut the essay
at all--which surprised me.  I sent it to them after calling Stephen
Berg and asking if he'd be interested.  He made no commitment
whatsoever, said the essay would be read by the three editors.  I
asked for a quick response--I assumed they would not take it, and I
would send it elsewhere quickly.  After two months, I badgered them,
and they took the essay (that was about a year ago).

The special section in New Orleans Review--which includes work by
several people on this list (Paul Naylor, Jake Berry, Lisa Samuels,
etc.)--was put together by Bill Lavender.  He did an extraordinary
job, locating an exciting range of "southern" (US) poetry.  If you're
interested in the results, e-mail me backchannel.  I have a few extra
copies, and would be glad to mail you one.

As in the previous discussion of independent bookstores ... if these
and other similar incursions appeal to you, it might be worthwhile to
write the editors and note your approval.  I know that in the case of
the New Orleans Review, letters of support would lend credibility to
the wonderful work that Bill Lavender did.  In fact, the magazine
might continue to give him space if there is an interest in the "new"
work.

And as part of this purgative de-lurking, I also have a collaborative
(with Yunte Huang) prose piece on Chinese poetry-politics  in the
current issue of Central Park.

I've been quite interested in the ongoing WCW discussion.  Normally,
I would be contra-Foster, but I've just been teaching and re-reading
Spring and All.  Yes, Ron Silliman's point is, alas, correct:  Spring
and All would still, today, be a difficult manuscript to get
published.  And yes, Alan Golding, I believe, is right: for many
readers, including many today, Spring and All provides a place of
permission.  But personally, this time through Williams, my own
response is closer to Ed Foster's--I'm not finding much that excites
me.  Thus, back to points raised by Rod Smith and Ed Foster
both--when is a work "used up."  For me, some WCW, including much of
Spring & All, is beginning to sputter, to run on fumes.  Which makes
me want to re-read Paterson....?

A new chapbook from WellSweep.

Yang Lian has been published in Talisman and Conjunctions 23.

Also he really exists (he's actually staying here with us at the=
 moment),
so don't worry about the Yasusada syndrome.

Also, please check out Wellsweep's web site:

        http://www.inforamp.net/~cayley/wshome.html

and a new page of sample poems published in its books:

WHERE THE SEA STANDS STILL

Yang Lian

WellSweep Chinese Poets 6+
translated by Brian Holton

Yang Lian (born 1955) is one of the best-known of the so-called 'misty'=
 or
'ambiguist' poets who came to prominence in China during the 1980s.=
 He has
published six collections of poetry and two anthologies of prose=
 in Chinese.
His work has been translated into many European languages, and English
versions of his poems have been widely published in magazines. WellSweep
brought out a book-length collection of his shorter poems, Non-Person
Singular in 1994. 'Where the Sea Stands Still' is the first complete
publication of Yang Lian's most recent work. It is the most important=
 piece
he has written since leaving China. Yang Lian's ever-moving 'sea'=
 stands
still in the midst of its restlessness; it is here in the midst of=
 nowhere;
and in the space of the poem, time is swept away. Because of Odysseus,=
 the
sea began its endless ebb and flow; when this sequence was written,=
 the sea
stood still, and became an illusion.

Brian Holton teaches Chinese at the Universities of Newcastle and=
 Durham. He
is also the translator of WellSweep's first collection of Yang Lian's
poetry, Non-Person Singular.

The book reproduces paintings inside and on the cover by Gao Xingjian,=
 a
pioneer of avant-garde literature in China who is best-known internationally
as a dramatist. In 1989 Gao moved to Paris as a political exile and=
 in 1992
he was made Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres de la France.=
 His
paintings have been exhibited in numerous one-person and group exhibitions,
and are held in the collections of many public galleries throughout=
 Europe.

32 pp, 21 x 13 cm, parallel text. 4 b/w illustrations.

GBP=A32.95 (US$6) pbk ISBN 0 948454 25 3
This edition is strictly limited to 200 copies. It is only available=
 direct
from the publisher.
26 additional copies have been printed on special papers and bound=
 by sewing
(rather than stitching). Inquiries welcome.

Well, fortunately, ed, WcW will not be "tossed out" anytime soon.  Why
this penchant for purgation?

As for eric's and Hank's recent posts: geez, do I have to admit WcW is
not exactly exciting?  To me it's not so much a question of
excitment/boredom as it is a matter of knowing why he did (DID) matter.
What was it he did that was (WAS) important?  No where was this
discussed; matter of fact dismissal, while making good posts, is another
matter when it comes to accounting for a particular poets relevance.
Bahktin may not be cutting edge any longer, but is he any less useful?
NO, in case you thought otherwise.  Peter Stallybrass's work with B. has
been very important and is still very relevant.

Two other things: eric: i was thinking about your picasso comment and
think that, yes, WcW is something along the same lines (though P. is
obviously more exciting and important)a;  that is, he has been absorbed,
he no longer shocks.  Have you listened to The Rite of Spring lately.
Those pounding rhythms must have been distressful at one point, but they
no longer shock.  Quite tame, really, compared to the new Strapping Young
Lad CD.

I forgot the other thing....  Um....  Well, anyway, what I've found
disappointing about this exchange is the lack of discussion about why he
is boring. And, really, is that even a word to be using?  I mean, I have
not learned a thing from such a dismissal.  Tell me what's exciting.  Or
let me tell you . . . .

Amen to what Cris is saying.
On the other hand I am thinking that perhaps no permission is needed in
any case because anything posted is in the public domain? EPC should be
thanked as courtesy.  On the other hand, in the improbable case that some
money will be made from publishing any rengas in whole or in part,
perhaps the money should be donated to the institution where the list
originates, i.e., SUNY at Buffalo, which pays for EPC.

(Gulp) Okay. Here goes.

     When the Senorita Died

     12: 24 and Chimes Street is all perturbed with heat.
     It's summer, five days after the Shrimp and
     Petroleum Festival, yes, and I am looking for a tab
     with my coffee. I have to see Jackie and Dennis
     for a late lunch, but at this point, all I am
     thinking about is where I will find my next hit.

     At the Lebanese, I have an Abita and
     cheese fries and buy APR to see what folks
     are doing in the real world. There's a feature
     on Merwin and something about the Pacific
                             but I toss it into the street
     and go to the Varsity because Alice (Quietcar, I think)
     will be tending bar and she gives out free martinis
     if you can remember who played the night before.
     The cool thing is she never knows so I say Orlando
     and for once she doesn't check with the front desk
     and shakes up a 'tini while I wait.

     This is Louisiana, so I head off with drink in hand
     to Highland, for the latestHaraway, but find it
     all too langweilig so sit by Godfather's
     to watch until  Dolores comes by
     because she always has Wired and US News
     and World Report and on the front page I
     see here name outlined in red ink,

     and I shiver and I remember Four Aces in Brownsville
     trying to piss in a trough with five other fellows
     while while she whined a song along with the accordian
     and everyone and I stopped micturating

INcidentally, I should say that I am working on my exams now, and at some
point in my life will surely discredit everything that I've said on this
list so far for the reason that I am very very grouchy.Also, isn't it still
true that the sincerest form of flattery is imitation (please say so)?

In response to Charles Bernstein's request: My only book publication
is U. S. OBSERVATORIES (Van Nostrand Reinhold). This is a book about
observatories. It has a number of good pictures in it, taken by
observatories, who have very good cameras. The book is out of print
and if anyone sees it in the astronomy section of a used book store I
wish you would buy it and let me buy it from you since I only have
2-3 copies myself. It tends to get stolen from libraries.

thanks gale, good to hear/see from you,  and to some extent, esp w/ students,
it happens "naturally" --(like, who else wd i nominate for prizes --my most
boring students?, and yes, that works, tho because of my limited credibility
--my intellectual orientation is considered eccentric by my shakespearean and
woolfian colleagues --my students end up w/ the $500 prizes rather than the
$1500 main prizes --it's still something, and they feel supported and
believed in, which is the most impt. thing).  my ego still gets in there,
tho, and that's one of the main casualties of this professional life, i think
--in a field where intellectual property is everything, it can hurt to do
something for years and not get anywhere, then some shallow hotshot (or worse
yet, some square with a lot of local institutional power who suddenly
"discovers", say , lyn hejinian) comes in and with one word makes your field
legit --but you still don't get any "credit"... well, that's an issue for the
daily meditation practice i guess and while it's as "real" or unreal as
anything else and thus merits saying, it merits saying only so that one (i)
can then move beyond that sphere of concern and be really real, like, do my
own thing and invite others to join...i.e. more of same...sorry everyone for
airing these petty ego concerns but some of you might just relate...i
hope.--md

After the first 500 examples, or thereabouts, all these rengae begin to

with that slightly overbloated line length that seems so invariable.
What is it about this form that imposes these limitations?

this is an interesting tho not novel or unpredictable revelation to me about
my own mind, technology etc --is this:  because i can't "skim" the rengas but
have to really read them, they are alternately the most thrilling,
life-giving msgs on the list, and the most distracting and daunting.  when
i'm panicked for time --as i now am, being on aol rather than a gratis univ.
system --it takes a commitment of attention i initially resent but (like
schlepping to the library to do research) ends up being gratifying in
unpredictable ways --i never know what i'll learn, and the rengas alter my
consciousness more than, say, my own whining about lack of institutional
support for my field, or discussions about the usefulness of wcw.

by the way, what does "a single angel is frightening"  mean: that more angels
are less frightening because angels are not meant to be alone, or that if a
single angel is scary, imagine how scary a whole flock wd be?-md

In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
The rook to the knight here by King's Bishop Three
Something has changed in the nature of friendship
But wouldn't you know it, Mrs. Mullett next in line
For food stamps, quints racing about the linoleum
Everything leans on the verb, falling, sighs
Twelve at least, one loves only firm, and firm
feels good to her it feels real good, & the corset
blanches from so many passwords being lifted like expected bans
on metaphors that the folks at the contagious hospital
thought we might be weaned of early, late, whatever,
but I am taking the broken glass as a token of my first epiphany
sassafras is my powerlessness to split scintillas in the mist
of lathering first frost as noon comes on like torqued weed
sucking on the indescribable and taking the ineffable for a walk
to Paris via seed cigars and chicory and plantain butts
a powdery king of aftertaste but all right

Ed, a good part of what makes your stance unconvincing is how much it
depends on actions that occur without agency (e.g., Bahktin who "got
tossed out awhile ago" without saying why or who did such tossing). As
someone who was reading him in '72 and felt that the whole fad served
only to bring works into print and who was pleased to see the MLA kudzu
die back from that arena, I still find real value in his work. And
Williams also. There is an assumption in your stance that just because
someone's work is situated in a context, say, of the 1930s, that its
value remains there. In fact, even when someone undergoes an intense
period of adoption, as WCW did (or Olson or Duncan or Creeley more
recently), it is arguable whether all that exists within the work ever
gets excavated by readers or usefully understood by other
practitioners. One can read Wordsworth absolutely for his contemporary
(or as they say at Duke, post-contemporary) values. Why not Williams
also? What about all this writing?

tho hold out for bits of _Imaginations_ -- so, what's so bad abt Bakhtin
again? Is Olson in the same space as WCW, do ya think?

Remember an interview w/ a Poundian named Carlo Parcelli where the
interviewer asked him, really, "What makes Olson so good?" & he replied
"Because he's not a poet, he's a historian."
Which I still find both interesting & cause for loss of cookies.

I recall that way back when Douglas Messerli was still teaching, at Temple,
he had only one outraged graduate seminar (being of course an otherwise not
only brilliant but beloved instructor): in a modern poetry course he
spozedly taught /Spring & All/ & /Kora in Hell/, and the students were just
irrevocably non-plussed--and Temple wasn't, as it isn't, ahem, Iowa, or I
guess in light of recent posts I should say "Iowa."

Think what's dangerous is certainly contextual. Are, in the phrase of a
friend of mine, the "so-called Nuyoricans" dangerous? Somehow, on MTV, no.
But in person some of them, powerful, convincing, useful.

The infiltration oddly neither group nor individual-- walking into a workshop
situation there seems group resistance to "experimental," but individual,
perhaps, acceptance. Though this is also a matter of search for group
vocabulary with which to discuss these things, if one imposes the terms it
becomes rote & nobody learns anything. So I'm neither comfortable nor
uncomfortable teaching, but consider, suppose "we" "win"-- what does *that*
mean. This is putting it on the line folks, will the terms change, even a
little? Since this seems my night to quote interviews, in the Cage/Retallack
thing I published she asked him whether he thought artists could change "the
grammar of the way we are together." His response was a long pause & then "we
don't know, but we can try." Seems to me we're really talking about trying to
change what Weber called "the iron cage or bureaucracy" & we'd oughta be
prepared to fail grandiosely &/"or else" succeed,
w/ a whimper (not a bang).

Subject:      Distribution

(Sorry if you receive this twice - the Sydney Uni server was down on the
weekend and I'm note sure whether this got through)

Sorry I'm running late replying to this thread.

I am currently setting up a small press distribution network in Sydney
which will handle Australian small press stuff in the first instance but we
may well be able to take some os stuff after we get up and running. I'll
keep list members up to date. (we will also run stores at readings seminars
and the like and it may be possible to take one or two copies of o/s
magazines to sell on consignment that way - we'll see).

There have been a number of attempts to set up distribution networks in
Australia over the years. Most have them have fallen down because of the
distances involved. You really need to have staff in each capital city and
given Australia's small population and massive distances the economics just
don't add up. We are trying to overcome this by limiting ourselves to the
city and thye bookshops we know the best.

We will be also be setting up a virtual bookshop so a whole lot of
Australian small press publications should become available shortly via the
net.


regards

Speaking of hot shots -- Dinesh D'Souza has just published a book, _The
End of Racism_, in which he asserts that slavery was not a racist
institution.  Young Mr. D'Souza got a grant five times the size of yours
to "research" this book, and has been featured in two successive issues
of the Chronicle of Higher Ed. --  He shows that he is not a racist by
disagreeing with _The Bell Curve's_ arguments that intelligence is both
hereditary and racial, then proceeds to argue that black Americans just
happen to belong to a culture whose unwise life choices leads to them
doing less well on intelligence tests.

Back in the forties, C.L.R. James wrote that "It is instructive to read
the old monographs, articles, volumes, disputes on Negro intelligence,
tests, the shape of the head, the weight of the brain, etc.  Today all
that is dead."

well, you can't be right all the time -- but now that racism is at its
"end" I suppose we don't need to worry about such things anymore --

As another former D.C. resident used to say:
"Makes me wanna holler, throw up _both_ my hands!"

Gwyn,

(Sorry to everyone else as this should be directed) -- does the AWP have
back-issues of the Chronicle going back to origins? Christina Milletti,
a graduate student here at Brown, is researching the Chronicle, but cannot
get her hands on the early issues.

Her electronic address is Christina_Milletti@brown.edu.

Many thanks, and apologies to everyone else.

Thousnads of people died today for want of what could be found in poetry
in what authorities are describing as the most tragic aesthetic disaster
of the century.  Exact figures are not yet available, but New Jersey
disaster relief officials describe their region as particularly hard
hit.  One survivor interviewed at the Joyce Kilmer rest stop reported
that she narrowly averted the fate that suddenly befell all those around
her because she happened to glance at a scrap of verse someone had
written on a wall just as nearly all the other passengers in her van
collapsed from ennui.

Somebody give the Rengaists a chat line of their own and/or an electronic
magazine. Is "Poetics" the same thing as "Poetry"?  I don't mean to be
restrictive, but, as the joke goes about the husband (no sexism intended) who
petitions the judge for a divorce from his wife of fifty years, and the
judge asks, why, after all this time could you possibly want a divorce, the
husband replies, "Enough is enough already!"

Tenney, to Billy Luoma's post,
>>Pentium" Pro Processor Builds on Equity in Pentium Brand
>
you commented
>is this news or poetry (I know people are miserably dying for lack of
the news there--boring, right?--but really....?)
>
I took this as a post on naming in society, circa 1995, and found it
absolutely compelling. The Pentium Pro, which will be a household name
in about 3 years, is what we once would have called a "686" had the
copyright laws not failed to protect Intel's claim to ownership of the
"xx86" convention for computer chips. Note that Intel, which invoked
the figure 5 in its Pentium, does not continue the stepping process
with this next generation chip. That is an attempt to shake off AMD and
the other clone chip manufacturers and parallels, at least at a
distance, Microsoft's leaping changes in its Microsoft Word for
Windows, which went from 2.0 to 6.0 without intermediate steps (which
existed, however, in DOS) and from Windows 4.0 (nee "Chicago") to
Windows 95 (a name that's going to get OLD fast).

While they're not as aggressively silly and Americo-centric as the
internet features named after Archie comix characters, it's worth
noting that the naming styles of the computer industry have had (and
are having, as we speak (if this be speech)) differs dramatically from
the nature of such conventions earlier in the century. I forget who
first noted that discourses that are insecure about their knowledge
tend to be pompous in their terminologies, viz. the use of Latin to
characterize in English what Freud simply called the I, the it and the
superI. Or structuralism's love of acronyms (think of Althusser and all
that type wasted on ISA, RSA etc.).

I already feel "fond" of how Pentium Pro suggests that the Pentium chip
itself is somehow amateurish (up until 6 months ago, 95 percent of all
Pentium systems were being sold to home users--the corporate ramp-up is
very slow, but the home buyer wants the full suite of bells and
whistles NOW).

Sincerely yours

 In the books were dreams and in the dreams were books.
 And flew through windows, lightning green and fine morning
 First inverted whistle of a cardinal in the poplar
 The book and the oboe on the grass under sun and cloud
 Go endlessly, an obtuse Prussian blue, it binds
 The rook to the knight here by King's Bishop Three
 Something has changed in the nature of friendship
 But wouldn't you know it, Mrs. Mullett next in line
 For food stamps, quints racing about the linoleum

 Twelve at least, one loves only firm, and firm
 feels good to her it feels real good, & the corset

 but I am taking the broken glass as a token of my first epiphany
 sassafras is my powerlessness to split scintillas in the mist
 of lathering first frost as noon comes on like torqued weed
 sucking on the indescribable and taking the ineffable for a walk
 to Paris via seed cigars and chicory and plantain butts
 mixed with automaton condolences nixed by Dr. Reynolds

I suspect a renga (have you seen the renga on the web? I think it's listed

I suspect a renga of lines half the length might invoke

plural of renga is rengae? I guess so

It's interesting, finally, to think of poetry as viral; I tend to do the

Poetry as substance, something to think about.

While few people (if any) go to the trouble to register copyright for
anything they post to newsgroups, mail lists, etc., everyone technically
"owns" the texts they write, regardless of the context in which they were
published. You may chose to (or not to) register your copyright with the
appropriate governmental agency, or you can assign it to EPC or whoever you
wish if you so choose, but the copyright for your words is yours unless you
take some kind of action.

Online text (or visuals or sound, or whatever) is not (yet) in the public
domain, despite the fact that it is often treated as if it is.

Which is not to deny the truth & utility of citing the situation and
location of the original "renga."

That said, add my name to the list of folks who zap rengas on sight.

No, no, I didn't mean to say that Williams' whole project is a failure.  I
meant at those individual moments or poems where the actual work doesn't
quite measure up to the project.  I wouldn't say all his poems were
successful (by whatever criteria), just as I wouldn't say they all fail (how
wishy-washy of me!)  But I would amend your last statement:  the everyday is
not *inherently* trivial.  Some of us (people) make and experience it that
way all the time, and maybe all of us experience it that way much of the
time.  That's what makes the striking things so striking:  the contrast.

Good point.  The influence isn't going to go away, for awhile anyway.  It's
just a question of how loudly his voice sounds in our ears compared to all
the other voices.  Ed, maybe you're just sick of the New Jersey accent?

Why don't you start on a real Poetics topic that would be so engrossing
that even the rengans would stop what they are doing and come listen in
awed silence?

Things that probably count less as poetics than poetry making:

list of bedside readings
announcements about readings
bibliographical info
commercial info (book x available from press y)
anecdotes about bookstores
editorials about bookstores
comments about the political scene
jokes (in prose)
anagrams
opinions about whether wcwilliams is boring or not

The collaborative poem dulls and repeats when it lacks context.
I'd say context is provided, and collective attentiveness created
by the prose discussion. When the prose flags, the poetry becomes
a-contextual somehow, performing eventual reifying services of the medium
itself. In this medium the critical specifity that social
contexts provide is made homogeneous and is virtually erased -
markers a/effecting context, for instance just the fact of a post
from New Zealand, or a post of Sept. 15th at 3:00 a.m. on a
rented computer, etc., all but their names are erased from the
emailed _message_ (in Jackobson's sense) itself, unlike,
obviously, a letter (e.g. a type of paper, ink, envelope, etc.,
in short, of a specific letter, from NZ). An established poet whose
name is a currency in many media/genres and an unknown name
floating solely in the listserv perform as peers, in a way, to
a context-in-the-making (if there will be any at all). The most
hardy and only context of the medium readily seems to be purely
the informational one of distributing news economically. Good
morning Virilio. Beyond that, what sort of informational poetics
can arise? There needn't be anything more, of course. But if
there is a desire for there to be something more, as perhaps the
collaborative poem is hopefully a signal of (shurely not the
opposite, that is, narcissistic emblems of a socioeconomically
stable/wealthy livelihood??)... - then it would seem,
tautologically, that social context will arise only through the
information contributed, and that this would take form in the
prose discussion (= the world). One available contextual tension
the medium can create for "itself" and its agents beyond the role
of information-distribution seems to be the dynamic between the
poetry and the prose. When the prose dimishes, so too the
poetry's affectivenes. I'm suggesting that the collaborative poem
diminishes in appeal when a) the fetishistic aspect of the medium
itself is allowed to dominate, going surreally out of control in
the form of sheer quantity of postings by single and few contributors to
the poem, and when b) there is a dwindling of prose dialogue -
the only means of supplying contexts of address for the
collaborative poem due to the character of the medium itself. So
I think that the dismissal of the poetry is misplaced, or at best
only half the story. Good night.

Ron:

thanks for the subtle (within the veil) excursus.  So it WAS poetry!  I
guess what I had in mind was a long poem Charles B read here in Tucson maybe
4-5 years ago now, which started with a long computer-blurb passage--which
was compelling just because attention divided (mine did that is) between
let's say materialized language or discourse AND, otoh, a kind of
techie-groupie interest in whatever software was being described.  So that:
what Bill posted is nice, and IS poetry (rather than "rhetoric" [as] if that
distinction still holds) because it's a little hard to tell whether one
isn't spozed to (just?) share the enthusiasm over the new sleek model.

Maybe "pro" just means the floating decimal works?

I sit and look out
hunkering on 386sx20 haunch
dreaming of software not hardware....

it's renga, but jeez, what the hell does it mean?

Subject:      Donald Davie 1922-1995

I'm taking time out from unexpectedly heavy grieving to note the loss
of a great British poet, Donald Davie. He and I corresponded and met
and, like at least some of the obituary writers on him in recent days,
fell out; I wish now, like some of them I suspect, that I had sorted
this out, but there always seemed more time to come. I only found out
that he'd died when I moved into a new flat and his face was peering
out of the obituary page of a newspaper in the bin in the empty room.
        He was always used as a whipping boy, an establishment figure
to rebel against, and rarely thanked for his critical work recommending
not just British poets but British poetry - as a poetry that should
be international and should make serious work with language, and let
language work on the poet. He was attacked jealously by many who wanted
his position of eminence (he could always get an article in the TLS
much better than any others there) but who would never do the labour,
of writing well at length and dealing with institutions, that Davie did
to *achieve* this eminence. It was always assumed that this eminence
was somehow given to him, as privilege, and always assumed that he
reacted out of fear and stupidity to certain areas of the avant-garde
that he didn't favour as much as he favoured Pound. For me, however,
his *criticisms* based on *reading* (rather than *assent*) of the
British avant-garde stick. See Barry and Hampson eds. _The Scope of
The Possible_, Manchester University Press, 1994, for a fine example
of such Davie-bashing.
        If his criticism was begrudged, his poetry was ignored; yet,
its emphasis on language, its sometimes entirely abstract pleasure with
difficult syntax and vocabulary, and its constant self-questioning
and interest in ideas and epistemology, certainly helped me, as a
schoolboy knowing only Philip Larkin, to bridge to Pound and, indeed,
the Language Writers - to whom he is much closer in energy and labour
and *vanguardism* (ie the desire to bring the future in, from the margin,
not stay in the margin) than any other post-war British poet. If I were
to compare him to a painter, I would say no other had such a fine grasp
of one aspect of her or his (colour/pigment/mixing/framing/brushwork)
art - for none has the skill below with vocabulary, with verbs, with
a form that is both syntactically spacious and *not* spare and
stripped-down in vocabulary; he is somewhere between Creeley/Neidecker
and Yeats, and that amazes me as a feat:


OX-BOW


        The time is at an end.
                The river swirled
      Into an ox-box bend, but now
        It shudders and re-unites:
        Adversary! Friend!

        Adverse currents drove
                This pair apart.
      A twin tormented throe embraced,
        Enisled between them, one
        Quadrant of earth, one grove.

        Now for each other they yearn
                Across the eyot
      That the particular flow of each
        Carved out, determined. Now,
        Now to each other they turn.

        And it is past belief
                That once they forked;
      Or that, upstream and bypassed, trees
        Mirrored in mid-reach still
        Break into annual leaf.

Jim,

I forwarded your question on to Lyn and Barrett, neither of whom are on
the Poetics List. There is some question of whether Barry ever READS
his email, but at least there is an address. The third editor (who has
never seen his work as such make it to print), Kit Robinson, may want
to reply in more detail.

My understanding is this. There was a long delay created by ye olde
funding problems plus the mind-numbing detail of getting the PhD and
doing the dissertation (no word yet on whether it has been completed).
On top of which, Barry has been deeply ambivalent about poetry (and
especially langpo) for some time. Kit was brought on to resolve some of
the workload and inertia issues, but when Barry toddled off to Detroit,
he took the manuscripts with him. Don't know where it currently stands.
I once noted that he had achieved a status with my manuscripts normally
reserved for the likes of Kirby Malone and Doug Messerli...greatest
time held without publication. He was not amused.

Frankly, it's reasonable in such a situation to insist on publication
or to take the work back.

The sad thing is that it was a great mag, particularly in the first
five issues or so.

Yes, everyone owns what they write, and can therefore give or refuse
permission to reproduce it. However, in some circumstances work can be
reproduced without copyright holder's permission, providing that "all
reasonable measures" to identify copyright holders and obtain permission
have been taken. In the case of "works of multiple authorship" where it's
difficult to identify individual rights, a rubric of this kind is often
used. Obviously, this doesn't apply where the copyright holder has
actually denied permission to reproduce. I'd say (privately, but not in
court) that contacting the list where the renga was written is taking "all
reasonable measures" providing that no mean-minded little so-and-so
actually objects personally...

Or to put it another way: if you've rung the renga writer for their rights
and got a ringer, you can quote the written renga with the writer's rights
unritten - you can rate their rights unbidden and so on -

Although in this renga in question, or at least in several versions of it,
at least one of the lines I wrote (and I suspect this is true for others as
well) has been altered by someone else without my permission. This has been
done in ways I don't like at all (and to this I object), and more radically
altered (the whole form of the renga) in ways I like quite a lot. So, whose
writing is it? Did someone violate my rights by altering it in the first place?

Maybe my objection makes me a mean-minded little so-and-so, except that I do
give permissions to use whatever version anyone wants to use for any purpose
whatsoever. But I think that this time I really mean it when I tell myself
I'm not contributing to the rengas any more.

It sounds like people are 12-stepping off the renga.
I hope you all are as weak about quitting as I suspect I am.
Louis, I'd like to see a demonstration, with charts,

I apologize. Rights squabblers--go directly to the archive

I try to glance through each of these shameful books as they come
out. They make me want to wretch. But D'Souza's should be marked out
for special attention. It is truly execrable. It even inspired the
normally complacent Richard Rorty to something like moral outrage
in the latest NYTBR.

One expects the resurgence of "scientific" racism in things like THE
BELL CURVE at a time like this in our country, and knows the
tremendous amount of argument & evidence that can be brought to bear
against it as well -- small if cold comfort. But D'Souza's book goes
so far beyond that -- making the most outrageous and unbelievable
assertions (slavery not being racist among them). It is just gross.

Here's a thought: at least one group besides "minorities" gets
"preferential treatment" in the US: young, callow, mean-spirited, dumb
conservatives, especially if they have some minority background or
other. I could name names.

I will fabricate a relation between this topic and Poetics (or at
least renga) if pressed.

I've been lurking for a while but have to put in my vote: PLEASE, PLEASE,

don't have sophisticated email and can't filter messages, and I'm tired

Please excuse my rancor, but it does seem that people on this list are

What counts as "poetics," Jorge asks? A reasonable enough question, to which I
wish I had an answer. However: in Jorge's list of 10 "things that probably
count less as poetics than poetry-making," one could find at least half in the
poetry-making of (for instance) Pound, Olson, H.D., David Antin, Susan Howe .

As my first posting, I am listing publishing information for a book

AUTHOR:     Peter Baker
TITLE:      _Deconstruction and the Ethical Turn_
PRESS:      University Press of Florida
DATEP:      1995
PRICE:      $34.95

From the ad copy:

_Deconstruction and the Ethical Turn_ demonstrates the continuing
importance of deconstruction and other related movements for current
literary theory, insisting on the seriousness of the deconstructive
enterprise, its philosophical background, and its possible usefulness
for negotiating the political terrain of the postmodern university
   Peter Baker deals with the theories of such major figures as
Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Emmanuel Levinas
and Julia Kristeva.  He concentrates on the ways that deconstruction
allows for an increased understanding of the ethical reading of texts
and disputes the view that it places all decision making in the realm
of the text.  Deconstruction and related types of critical thinking
have real-world effects, he argues, and they offer ways of understanding
and resisting intersubjective violence. [...]
   Peter Baker is associate professor of English at Towson State Univer-
sity, Towson, Maryland, and the author of _Obdurate Brilliance:
Exteriority and the Modern Long Poem_ (UPF, 1991) and _Modern Poetic
Practice: Structure and Genesis_ (1985) and coeditor of _The Scope
of Words: In Honor of Albert S. Cook_ (1991).  He is the editor of
a book series, Studies in Modern Poetry.

Comments: To: poetics <poetics@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>

I agree with Charles Bernstein that practice overtakes theory but I don't
want the kid next door to bang scales on the piano all day long while
I am trying to do anything with my head.  Therefore I have decided to buy
that kid an electric keyboad and earphones. As to me, I am leaving the public sector, the U.S. Department
of Renga, and returning to private practice. I think I have served
honorably though obnoxiously at times for which I apologize. I am going
to be a renga consultant, though, and if someone posts a renga, I
will probably add a line and send it back to the poster only not to the list.
I have already invited a number of people to send lines to me to start on
a number of private rengas. Once in a while we can send a ***closured***
renga to the list. If anybody wants to unclosure it, do it in the privacy
of your home and send it to us.

So on to the next topic. In all seriousness, I think that combatting
scientific racism is crucial.

In a lighter artery, anagram practice will never overtake theory so they
are ok in my estimation.

And so goodbye, an old rengan never cries, s/he just howls away.

I just wanted to invite members of this list to take a look at the Web
version of my mss. _The Spectra_, a collection of 40+ high-velocity lyrics
(sorry, RS -- not sure what else to call 'em). Most have seen mag print (in
_New Directions_, _Talisman_, _Mudfish_, _BAP '94_, _Denver Qtly_ & others)
but are yearning mightily toward the bookable, Web or no Web.  Some audio
included.

The URL is:   http://fmref.library.cornell.edu/spectra.html

My apologies for the self-advertisement.  I do not undertake this lightly,
but since I went through the hassle of putting the damned thing up in html,
it'd be nice if at least a few folks knew about it.

With regard to Dinesh D'Souza: anybody else see the William Raspberry
column about the two writers whose names escape me, both black
conservatives, who were so incensed by DD'S's book that they publicly
dissasociated themselves from the American Enterprise Institute (the
"think" tank that ponied up the dough)?  It'll be interesting to see if
this "study" pits the right against itself: part of me would like to see
that, but part of me worries that such an event would lend support to the
myth that there is actual political discussion in the U.S.

Subject:      MILLENNIUM ANTHOLOGY

We -- Pierre Joris & Jerome Rothenberg -- would like to announce that
our anthology _POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM: The University of California
Book of Modern & Postmodern Poetry_ (Vol 1: From Fin-de-Siecle to
Negritude) has just come out.
        It will probably be a few weeks until copies hit the
bookstores, but meanwhile, for those interested & unable to wait that
long, we will post (as a separate, longish e-mail) the Table of
Contents to this list.

        Here is how UCP describes the book:

The University of California Press is Proud to Announce:

The First Global Anthology of 20th Century Poetry


Poems for the Millennium
The University of California Book of Modern and Postmodern Poetry
Volume One: From Fin-de-Siecle to Negritude
Edited by Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris

0-520-07227-8  $24.95 paper
800 pages, 6 x 9", 20 b/willustrations



        POEMS FOR THE MILLENNIUM may well be the poetry
book-of-the-century: a synthesizing and global anthology with an
emphasis on those international and national movements that have tried
to change our ways of making poetry and art as a means  for changing
how we think & act as human beings.

        This first volume offers three "galleries" of individual poets
-- figures like Mallarme, Stein, Rilke, Tzara, Mayakovsky, Pound,
H.D.,Vallejo, Artaud, Cesaire, and Tsvetayeva--along with a sampling
of the most significant pre-World War II movements in poetry and the
other arts: -- Futurism, Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism,
"Objectivism," Negritude. The second volume will extend the gathering
to the present day, forming a synthesizing and global anthology that
goes beyond any existing twentieth-century collection in its cultural
scope and experimental range.

Jerome Rothenberg is a poet and one of the world's leading
anthologists. His more than fifty books include _Technicians of the
Sacred: A Range of Poetries from Africa, America, Asia, Europe and
Oceania_ (California, 1985). He is Professor of Visual Arts and
Literature at the University of California, San Diego.

Pierre Joris has published over twenty books of poetry as well as many
anthologies and translations. He is Associate Professor of English at
the State University of New York, Albany.



"The word anthology hardly does justice to Rothenberg and Joris's
brilliant reconceptualization of twentieth-century poetry in a global
context. This is that rare book that forces us to rethink what the
poetic is and can be." -- Marjorie Perloff

"This book is destined to become a fundamental resource for the study
of twentieth-century literature and culture. Its importance cannot be
overstated." -- Charles Bernstein

"A riveting literary achievement of phenomenal scope and generosity.
This illuminating compendium displays the best of humanity's bardic
inheritance and vision.... It should be obligatory reading for all
scholars, students, writers, and lovers of poetry." -- Anne Waldman

"In an accurately titled Poems for the Millennium we can at last sense
the scope of the Revolution of the Word that's been in process
sinceQoh, 1895. There's no other anthology like this one, no other
overview so adventuresome." -- Hugh Kenner

"Rothenberg and Joris's anthology gives us, by virtue of its organic
structure and inspired choices, the possibility of a kind of situated
internationalism.... It is a sourcebook for the future." -- Gary Snyder

"This is not like any other anthology, not a collection of
excellences, no absurd imitation of a canon. It's more like a Handbook
of Inventors and Inventions, or of Explorers and Discoveries, that
opens up all sorts of pathways for poetry from its past and future to
a living present... It is above all a book of possibilities and
invitations." -- David Antin

I think that Lightman's encomium for Davie is apt and shd surely be
welcomed. Davie , despite his crankiness in some areas, at least
announced to the stiff-necked English p[oetry crowd that there was
something happening elsewhere. His poetry sounds a little 19thC
English to North American ears, but it sounds a lot more beautiful
than the stuff you usually see printed in the establishment papers
over there. I think that North Americans always wonder how the hell
the Brits ever thought that Larkin was more than a light poet. But
Davie rests somewhere between the tight collar and proper vest, and
Mr Bunting, say. Maybe closest to someone like Tomlinson, who also
had an ear cocked westward. Only time I had a real serious talk with
Davie, though, was once when I visited Essex with a view to doing a
PhD on Bunting in 1966, and Davie sais not a chance, he was saving
him for himself. Better than the prof at Sussex who told me not a
chance, he had heard that this Bunting fellow was still alive.

Strong wind trying to get old
        green leaves off the trees, boughs bend

reflected in leaf-strewn fish pond,
        a contradiction in is this Fall?

Maple leaves too, curled and brown,
        caught in the yucca, an orange cat

hiding behind it, or is that some
        imposed imagination? Look at the figs

getting darker between fig leaves getting lighter;
        there's a ghost has time for flowers

in October, especially little red ones,
        because we are somewhere else, a

clothing store, a racing Pontiac, a lay-away
        plan called winter numbers on the wall

inside.

My thanks as well to Ira for the Davie obituary.  I remember a pleasant
hour spent with him in his office at Vanderbilt University, watching him
continually relight his pipe and counsel me, a prospective graduate
student, that I would be better off pursuing my honors thesis on Bunting
than on Robert Duncan.  When I told him how fascinated I was by the
eclecticism of Duncan's influences, he shook his head slowly:  "Eclectic
indeed--rather an eclectic _fudge_, I should say."  That was my
introduction to Bunting's work.  Later, he would send me a syllabus for a
graduate seminar he had taught on the Objectivists, from which Zukofsky
was unaccountably absent(!); "He would have taken up far too much of the
semester, with too little reward," was Davie's explanation.
        I was inclined to dismiss him as an old fart at the time, an
impression further strengthened by his scathing review of Williams's
collected poems a couple of years later, and his casual dropping
(somewhere) of the opinion that Niedecker was on a par with
Dickinson--both "minor female poets."  But if Davie was never quite
vanguard enough for my tastes, he always remained a staunch advocate of a
Poundian poetics--not a popular position in England, nor in America,
where Helen Vendler takes every opportunity to berate Davie for his
"unaccountable" appreciation of Pound.  [Speaking of which, does anyone
have a citation for the Ashbery interview where he says that Vendler told
him (Ashbery) in conversation, "Of course you don't like The Cantos.  You
have to be a fascist to like The Cantos"?]  He was always a graceful
writer--not a skill valued by many American academics, nor,
unfortunately, by many of those who write about poetry in America--and he
was never afraid to hold unpopular opinions.
        His Pound books remain useful.  His _Under Briggflatts_,while
highly spotty, is consistently entertaining.  My  personal favorite of
his books is _A Gathered Church:  the Literature of the English
Dissenting Interest, 1700-1930_, a lovely and eclectic piece of
historical scholarship and criticism.

A MOO is a MUD-Object-Oriented, and a MUD is a multi-user-domain or
dungeon; these developed out of role-playing games like Dungeons and
Dragons. The MUDs developed into various other forms, and the MOO is one
of them; it's a textual space, a virtual (textual) environment in which
users can both talk to one another in real time, and building/construct
various rooms, objects, etc. - again, all textual. LambdaMOO was the
first, began by Pavil Curtis at xeroxparc; Media MOO is run by the MIT
Media Lab (it's overt virtual space is that of the lab itself); and PMC
Moo, which I'm "active" on, is down at the moment, coming back as PMC2
(post-modern-culture, run out of the University of Virginia). To get to
Media MOO, telnet:
telnet 18.85.0.48 8888
and sign in as guest. Some commands: help gives you all kinds of
information; @go #<number> takes you to a location as in
@go #2014
which will take you to Tiffany;
say <xyz>
results in someone else reading
Guest says "xyz"
@join <name>
takes you to name, and
emote is feeling happy
results in someone else reading
Guest is feeling happy.
There are a number of commands; it takes a while to get used to it, but
becomes simpler as you go along. I've not been on Lambda, which has
thousands of users; Media is almost empty. PMC has been going through a
lot of politics and is changing as I've said.
These programs can run 35-40 megabytes, although the basics are around 4
megabytes; they also run in RAM and are downloaded several times a day,
in case of disk failure. The most sophisticated, like Media, have
libraries and research tools within them, like gopher and ftp access,
usable by groups of people at a time.

This reminded me of in the mountains work I have done; this weekend I was
in the mountains with two women both of whom had their brothers commit
suicide this past year. & one of the brothers had seen The Crow and
wanted to come back as a crow and help people and had said that shortly
before he died. & he hung himself on a jungle gym. In the mountains I
stayed in his room and a week before the anniversary of his death a dead
crow was found in the center of his bed. & everyone is scared.

In-Reply-To:  <199509270403.VAA09822@leland.Stanford.EDU>

I too mourn the loss of Donald Davie!  I first met Donald at one of those
Pound conferences at Orono and he was feisty and terrific: I like his
first Pound book very much, ARTICULATE ENERGY even better.  But he was a
very difficult and self-destructive person.  When I published my Frank
O'Hara book, he wrote me a letter scolding me for writing about such a
terrible person and objected vehemently to Frank's being gay.  "The
Muse," he told me, "is female!" and so GAYS CAN'T WRITE POETRY!  An
amazing, absurd letter.  He took the line, "I drink to keep from getting
bored," and said "If he's so bored let him leave poetry to those of us
who are not bored!" etc etc.

At some point in the 70s, he seemed to derail somewhat.  Having been such
a passionate fighter for the new, he left Stanford first for Vanderbilt
(which he sadly and mistakenly took for the "Old South") and then back to
England and became increasingly pugnacious and defensive.  I suspect it
was because he felt his poetry wasn't getting its due--and it's true (to
my mind) that DD was much better critic than poet.  But he did write some
wonderful reviews (collected in Barry Alpert's book) and essays on
Pound.  One of the best is the one about a walking tour in Provence and
how geography works in poetry.  He wrote brilliantly about syntax: the
difference a shift to the past tense could make.  But his politics became
increasingly problematic as did his social/cultural attitudes--and so it
was a sad last few years.

It's interesting to me that Ira is so keen on the poetry--makes me want
to go back and reread.

Whoops! Sorry to tread thus upon Charles's toes - I'd deleted all
previous postings on this (as I had all Rengas) and had forgotten that
anyone had dissented. It's a nice point, and you could all waste many
legal $$$ on it if you're so inclined:
(a) one refusal to reproduce does indeed scupper the whole collaborative
project, unless it can be agreed that
(b) it was a collaborative project from the outset, with everyone
accepting the possibility of collective revision.

I must say it looked pretty collaborative to me, from the outside - but
can I join those urging the Renga set to go into the back room and sort
it amongst themselves?

Good to read so many positive testimonials to Donald Davie. Like many I
grew up with his criticism around me, particularly the Pound work, and
I'll miss him, grumpiness and all. It seemed to fall on me to disagree
with him in public quite a lot - such as (a) when he suggested that the
Native North Americans are absent from Lorine Niedecker's Lake Superior,
(b) when he argued that Bunting was a poet of religious orthodoxy and (c)
when he asserted that Zukofsky wasn't worth talking about. So that when we
met we were both a little surprised to find that the other wasn't as
fierce as we'd expected. The remarkable thing was that he did generally
continue talking about such people when most UK "establishment" critics
didn't.

In his south-yorkshire bloody-mindedness ("the Geoff Boycott of
literature" someone said) Davie was very like the late Eric Mottram - a
comparison which would make both of them grumble a lot. But where Davie
came to assert tradition and authority, Mottram remained committed to
everything radical. With mentors like these, what shall we do but go
schizophrenic? And miss them both, in their various ways.

Subject:      Rengas and Williams

Although I spoke kindly of the renga and asked to print a piece of it,
it does begin to seem like one of those dancing diseases that they
caught in the Middle Ages.

I wouldn't want to make more trouble for anyone, but a few simple
electronic commands on the Buffalo listserver would set up another
list called "Renga" --or maybe "Rengaroom"--no that has too many
letters.

Meantime, I think I have come across something that illustrates
exactly what Williams did for us in writing "Spring and All." Compare
that poem with this one, copyright 1911, by Cordie Webb Ingram whose
face peers out with innocent wonder from the frontespiece of her
collection of poems, published by Broadway Publishing.

SPRINGTIME

By Cordie Webb Ingram

It is springtime, happy springtime, once again,
All Nature seems aroused as if from sleep;
The bird's notes thrill us--oh, so clear and deep--
The western zephyrs round us gently sweep,
And whisper promises of joy for pain.

There is a hint of active life within the wood;
The brown, bare limbs of winter turning green,
The bare earth woos a fresher, brighter, sheen,
The subtle snunlight steals the leaves, between,
As if these children of the forest understaood.

The frisky squirrel leaps from bough to bough
[I don't think I care to type in more about the squirrel]

There is a mighty whispering 'neath the soil.
The infant plants anticipate the light,
And vaguely dream of time, when they bedight,
Will flaunt themselves in shades, red, green, and white;
Transition strange, accomplished without toil.

[after several more stanzas the poem ends with the assertion that
"sweet Springtime...keeps us daily from the Tempter's snare."]

Now Williams:

By the road to the contagious hospital
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds driven from the
northeast--a cold wind. Beyond, the
waste of broad, muddy fields
brown with dried weeds, standing and fallen

patches of standing water
the scattering of tall trees


All along the road the reddish
purplish, forked, upstanding, twiggy
stuff of bushes and small trees
with dead, brown leaves under them
leafless vines--

Lifeless in appearance, sluggish
dazed spring approaches--

They enter the new world naked,
cold, uncertain of all
save that they enter. All about them
the cold, familiar wind--

Now the grass, tomorrow
the stiff curl of wildcarrot leaf

One by one objects are defined--
It quickens: clarity, outline of leaf

But now the stark dignity of
entrance--Still, the profound change
has come upon them: rooted they
grip down and begin to awaken.

It would be easy to write pages of commentary comparing these two

all their differences. But Williams's is like some huge and at first

Subject:      bland abstract lyrics, or you've got wheat in your eye

        Ron Silliman's side comment, a few days ago, that "bland abstract
lyrics" are now the dominant strain of avant garde writing in 1995 is
a criticism that emerging avant garde writers need to pay close attention
to. The silence attending his remark (which, admittedly, he made on the
side of other
concerns) is disturbing. Do the younger avant garde writers on this list
accept Ron's characterization? Are the potential implications of such a
comment (that new avant garde writers are out of touch, apolitical, or
otherwise spaced out) also things that you accept? I think that there's a
far vaster range of committed, intelligent, and innovative emerging
writers out there than such a comment would imply, although it may be
true that there's more bland abstract disengagement than we ought to be
comfortable with. Whatever the truth of Ron's statement, is it acceptable
for younger writers to let an older, justifiably respected writer such as
Ron Silliman be the only commentator on this list on the subject of
what emerging avant garde writers are up to? Would not quiet on this
subject imply a (perhaps unintentional) public agreement,
an implied agreement that we ought very definitely to challenge?

My one vivid recollection of Donald Davie comes from the late 1960s,
at Stanford.  Bruce Franklin, who was organizing an armed militia
(The Venceremos Brigade), would challenge fellow faculty members to
political debates.  Franklin was quite popular with the students; he
was also a quick thinker.  Nearly all of the faculty refused the
offer of a public debate.  (Bear in mind, these teach-ins took place
during a series of three successive springs when we shut down the
campus.)  Davie was the only one who took up Franklin's offer.  The
position that Davie took, which befuddled nearly everyone, was an
advocacy of the value of irony, a position which he articulated based
in part on some writings by Thomas Mann....

Subject:      Re: bland abstract lyrics, or you've got wheat in your eye

    My mail system was "down" for a few days so I missed Ron's original
posting.  I am gladly unsure whether my own poetry would be considered "avant
garde," but because I fall into the "young" category I wanted to voice my
opinion.  My poetry is certainly not bland or abstract, altho at times it is
lyrical.  It is also consciously political: in strains of Olson, Howe, Rexroth,
Baraka, Patchen, Oppen, Duncan and Silliman.
I can relate, however, with the generalizations made about young writers today
as implied by Mark's questions.  There are few writers my age  I know  who have
political concerns- or at least who let those concerns show in their poetry.
They may admire the poets I listed but not for the same reasons: that their
poetry possesses attentions to the past and present and regards politics as a
major player in individual lives.
On the other hand, there are more poets my age I have neither read nor met than
otherwise.  I cannot agree that any generational issues can be firmly
characterized while that generation is still "emerging."
As for "letting" Ron be the only commentator about what emerging writers are up
to: well, he's no longer the only one.  Altho, I've learned much from Ron's
writings, and am always interested in what he has to say.

Thank you, Mark, for bringing this up.

Since I would very much like to learn from the old avant guardists
I would need some ***concrete*** examples of bland abstract lyrics so as
to avoid them and of nonbland nonabstract lyrics so as to emulate them.

Responding to William Northcutt - I have here a leaflet advertising this bash.
You can get tickets in advance from the promoter, Goldmark, Orange Street,
Uppingham, Rutland, UK, telephone 01572 821 424. They cost 15 pounds, 12 pounds
50 and 10 pounds. But I should imagine you'd get in if you turn up at the Albert
Hall on the day. (Which is 16 Oct, at 7.30pm.)

Goldmark is run by Mike Goldmark, the eccentric second-hand book dealer and
gallery owner who championed Iain Sinclair by privately publishing his first
novel, White Chappell.

I can't imagine this venture will be other than a financial disaster but I'm

Hi! I'm Jeff Hansen, and I've just subscribed.

mark Wallace's challenge to emerging poets to answer Silliman's claim that we
are producing boring lyrics is worth paying attention to. How many young poets
has Ron read? Should he have much authority if he does not know much about us?
Could he name names please?

the reason i ask for such specificity is because, well, of course some of us
are boring lyric writers. but aren't most poets in any generation not going to
set the world on fire? Many of us do not write lyrics, and those that do
cannot be easily dismissed. Can the work of Juliana Spahr be considered bland
lyrics? For heaven sakes, she collages together material that she heard on
Oprah! Is Stephen-Paul Martin considered part of this younger generation? If
so, how can his "The Flood" (Runaway Spoon Press) be considered lyrical? It
uses an electric typewriter to create the most arresting visual poetry I have
yet to encounter. And who's to say that the lyric is entirely outmoded? If
what Silliman wants of a new generation us formal aesthetic novelty, I doubt
he'll get it from us. But, as has often been mentioned, the "make it new"
manifesto is now standard marketing tool for corporate America (new and
improved ERA meets new and improved experimental poetry.)

May i suggest that "what's new" about this generation is its abject refusal to
believe that new techniques are better techniques, that we must forge ahead
into the wild blue yonder of aesthetic innovation, etc. Isn't there plenty of
room for experiment, exploration, and expression in the forms already
available? And if that makes me appear conservative, then where do you wnat us
to go? Into poems composed of keyboard symbols such as &***((^%^$$~!@???
Seems boring.

The wild blue yonder school of poetic innovation may have hit a wall, because
what's on the other side, after we break on through, might be nothing more
than innovation for innovation's sake.  The advantage of working within the
"avant-garde" network is that it gives us a much wider assortment of formal
strategies, not that it sends us out.

Good question, Graham -- the answer is "none" -- for the 6 pages from
_In Parenthesis_ we wanted to include, Faber&Faber asked a permission
fee of more than $2000 (two thousanddollars), something quite
unacceptable to us. We decided,however, to leave his name in as well
the commentary on his work we had written. Jones is indeed one of the
most remarkable "British", well, anglo-welsh poets of that period &
someone whose work should be known & read much morewidely. -- Pierre

All I remember Ron S. saying was that he wondered how we got from
SPRING & ALL to "bland, one-page, abstract lyrics." It wasn't clear
to me that he meant orthodox or anti-orthodox, young or old, etc.
But I took the "bland" as the principal indictment, guessing that he
didn't mean to suggest that, say, Coolidge or Scalapino abstract
one-pagers were (are) worthless. I'm anxious to hear Ron's response
to all this -- I wonder if he's just letting this all go on to see
where it goes. I'm just as interested to know about Barret Watten's
recent "ambivalence" toward poetry, if Ron feels like filling us in.

I find it an interesting leap for Mark to make that Ron was necessarily
referring to younger writers as being those for whom the air was coming
out of the lyrical balloon. If we accept the bait, that Ron is casting
doubt on a new generation (rather than, say, his casting a wider net of
concern over poetry generally), then perhaps a younger generation will
have to articulate the multiplicity of designs it has on the future of
poetics. Variantly, if Ron's concern is more general, then everyone is
welcome to leap in, and contemplate.

Question. Where does the younger generation begin? End? What can be said
to be holding it together? What could be said to be holding together the
previous generation? How do we define the parameters of that generation?
Is it useful to generalize (say, poets from city x like to write about
boats, whereas those from city b are likely to use gerunds a great deal,
and poets who are friends with a tend to disdain representation...). Are
movements in poetry fluid or static? Are poets?

I admire the abstract lyric. I have yet to stop reading anything anyone
here says not to read. I like certain bland things, they cleanse. Is that
transitive? Do I have to give up the blandness of Henry James, or the
blandness of William Carlos Williams, or the blandness of Robert Duncan (a
wildly interesting bland and abstract poet) to appreciate the blandness of
Bruce Andrews I mean badboyness? Mark, I think it will be intensely boring
to defend the younger generation. What Ron asked was, how did it happen
that the bland abstract (one-page) lyric poem became the norm. It might be
better to keep nattering away at how this (alleged) change happened. I
blame the blandness of John Ashbery or rather the blandness of the vapor
that settles over the reader who tries to follow his seductive jumps.
Imitators produce works that mimic his jumps and connections without and I
know I'm treading on you (not you Mark, whose work seems ((productively))
closer to John Godfrey's work) both the cerulean and the gunk. But I'm
wrong, of course, in something like the way Ron is wrong.

I'm glad to see D Jones included. I didn't read his writing until the
70's, but remember him vividly as a man who used to come to have tea
with the art master at my school, the calligrapher and painter
Maurice Percival (towards whom I had ambivalent
feelings, since he was on the one hand enthusiastic and encouraging
 and on the other deeply and conservatively restrictive). So at that
time it never occurred to me that David Jones was anything other
than of the same kind. Best

No, I dont have any experience of a "generation" being "held
together". I do have, as others will, companions in poetry, as Blaser
puts it, but these include those poets you grew up with close, as I
with Fred Wah, or Blaser with Duncan; but these companions (despite
what Ed Foster might believe) include long-dead poets too, so that
Blaser includes Pindar, and I would if I were not so shy, include
Shelley.

Where is it a shock to see David Jones selected? Around here he has
been for a long time considered along with Basil Bunting the main

Maybe we can come to Silliman's challenge from what only appears to
be thje other side.

                                                                   Ge

        THE READER & YOU



        When we were sitting in our rows in high school English
class, we
were instructed that we should be careful to distinguish between the
person
who had written the fiction we were reading (usually Katherine
Mansfield)
and the narrator of that fiction. We were given to understand that
this was
a matter of the first necessary sophistication, and that from then on
we
could curl our lip and raise an eyebrow whenever we heard someone say

"Katherine Mansfield said in her story . . . ."
        It has taken me more years than I spent in high school to
figure out
that the principle involved works in other places as well. Here are
two such
examples:
        (1) The distinction between the person who writes a poem,
even a
short tidy lyric poem, and the voice you hear reciting it while you
look at
the silent book. That is to say, if you tell me that you re reading
Whitman,
I know that you are listening to the speaker he made up. People are
going
to tell me that I am discussing the persona here. But there is a
difference
between Prufrock and the voice speaking in a Fred Wah poem. Maybe
Eliot has two voices between himself and the reader. Anyway, when
Whitman wrote that his reader was encountering a man rather than a
book,
he was protesting against the fate that he knew faced any writer of
the first
person singular or "ensemble," that as soon as he writes those words
on a
piece of paper he has an other to read.
        (2) The distinction between "the reader" and the person who
is
holding the silent book and reading it.
        Sometimes I go so far as to say that the "author" and the
"reader" are
characters in any story. (The implications are interesting if you
extend this
structure to speeding tickets and marriage certificates.)
        How often you or I have read something in criticism or theory
about
"the reader," and realized that this construct is as distinct from us
as is
Patrick Henry or Spider Robinson.
        Anyone knows that literature is an idea but reading is what
you do.
Literature cant hurt you but reading can.
        (I am of course in my own ant-trap here, because no matter
what I
do, the "you" I am talking about is not the person reading these
words, are
you?)
        So that construct that certain critics like to write about,
"the reader,"
cant do anything about what is written. But if you are reading a book
you
can intervene. You can invent a reading.
        You can always skip page 35. You can read from the last page
to the
first. You can stick pages from a pornographic novel between Northrop

Frye's sheets. You can call the narrator of Atwood's second novel
Agnes.
Or you can intervene simply by reading the way you read.
        The person who wrote the book cant stop you. The "author"
cant,
either. And the "reader" doesnt know you exist.
        A lot of what they call "reflexive" writing is simply the
result of the
writer trying to be you. You are the ground of the so-called
postmodern.

I too am thrilled by the selection, by the project itself. But where, o
where, is Mina Loy?  My soul deflated considerably when I paged in vain
through all the galleries... are her poems to remain as fugitive as her
bowery constructions?

and in forums. There will also be the chance to hear in depth interviews
with individual writers and to listen to a wide and varied program of
readings. The festival will feature a special tribute to Elizabeth Jolley,
as well as a special event for school age readers and a host of exciting
umbrella events. Subjects covered by panels at the festival range from the
creative moment to the internet, from the turn of the millennium to the
killing of history and from reading to travel. Other subjects, such as
decadence, crime writing, ethics and writing about film are also covered in
the program.

SYMPOSIUM: (POST) COLONIAL FICTIONS: RE-READING ELIZA FRASER AND THE WRECK
OF THE STIRLING CASTLE.

University of Adelaide, 25-26 Nov., 1995.

Contact: Kay Schaffer, Department of Women's Studies, 08 303 5267 direct,
08 303 3345 FAX, e-mail: kschaffe@arts.adelaide.edu.au

Post-colonial studies within Australia have attempted to re-evaluate and
re- write colonial history to include those people either marginalised or
subjugated by the colonial process. This two day symposium will explore a
different aspect of post-colonial discourse through the exploration of one
of the best known events in Australian colonial history. In 1836 the
'Stirling Castle' was wrecked off the Queensland coast and many of the crew
together with the Captain's wife, Eliza, were marooned on Fraser Island.
Events surrounding the rescue of the castaways, in particular Mrs. Fraser,
received international media attention. In the last 160 years the story of
Eliza Fraser has become the subject of popular myth, fiction, opera, art,
film and scholarly research in the areas of cultural studies, literature,
history, anthropology, archaeology, women's studies, and the visual arts.
(Post) Colonial Fictions will examine critically the Eliza Fraser saga by
bringing together, for the first time, an interdisciplinary team of
academics, authors, artists and members of the Fraser Island community.
Discussions will include feminist analyses of the incident, textual and
iconographic representations of Aboriginal people, and Eliza Fraser as a
creative inspiration for the arts.

Speakers on 19th century ethnography, visual arts, and Fraser Island
history include: Ian Mc Niven, Lynette Russell, Rod McNeil, Olga Miller,
Elaine Brown; on 20th century cultural studies and Batdjala representations
include: Kay Schaffer, Sue Kossew, Jim Davidson, Jude Adams and Fiona
Foley. We are hopeful that the symposium will include an exhibition of
Fiona Foley's works and a performance by University of Adelaide
Conservatorium of Music students of the theatre opera: "Eliza Fraser Sings"
(arranged by Peter Sculthorpe/libretto by Barbara Blackman).

"In recent years the consolidation of Europe into the 15 states of the EU,
the integration of east and west within Europe, and the progressive turning
of Australia to its own Pacific backyard have furthered the impression of

THE WHOLE VOICE
2nd National Conference on Poetry, 3-5 November 1995 University of Sydney

The Whole Voice Poetry Conference aims to bring together those with an
active interest in and involvement with poetry in Australia. The conference
is a national one and is a follow-up to "The Space of Poetry" conference
held at Melbourne University in 1993. It is being jointly organised by the
University of Sydney and the Poets' Union.

The 1995 conference will include poetry readings and papers from poets,
editors, academics and publishers. Poets reading include Judith Beveridge,
Laurie Duggan, Susan Hampton, J.S. Harry, Jill Jones, Donna McSkimming, Jan
Owen, Geoff Page, Margaret Scott, Andrew Taylor, and Richard Tipping.
Paper-givers include Peter Steele, Susan Hawthorne, Rosemary Huisman,
Christopher Kelen, Jeri Kroll, Martin Langford, and Max Richards. Richard
Allen and Karen Pearlman will present a performance of dance and poetry on
Friday evening and Richard Tipping, will co-ordinate a display of visual
poetry. These two events will present other views of the idea of "voice" in
poetry. There will also be time for open readings and discussion.

"The Whole Voice" theme was glossed as : "a poetry that speaks as fully as
possible, that allows the repressed to speak, that doesn't reject or
diminish emotion, intellect or craft." The organisers expect this position
to generate debate and creative argument, as the idea of "voice" is
contentious. "The practising writer's idea of voice is an intimate friend,"
comments a poet. "Voice is a literary construction, with all the historical
contingency which that implies," writes an academic. The very understanding
of "voice" is basic to dialogue between all participants.

Date: 3rd to 5th November 1995
Venue: Woolley Building, University of Sydney

Cost: Early Registration (by 22Sept): $80; Full Registration $90
(Student/Unwaged: $45). Day Full Registration ($50, Day Student $25).
Registration includes Friday evening reception, am and pm teas, Sunday

Subject:      Re: Donald Davie

Nice to hear all the words about Donald Davie. He was, when I was an
undergraduate at Stanford (mid-70's), the most influential teacher I had. I
generally found him warm and kind, rather than difficult and
self-destructive, although I agree with Marjorie that it seemed as if he
became more difficult later. He taught me to hear poetry in a way no one had
(nor has since), as he had an ear which could encompass the music of Pound
and that of Tennyson (at his best, in some poems in the middle of In
Memoriam). He gave me an abiding love of the works and spirit of Christopher
Smart. Those may sound to some here like small gifts, but they weren't,
because they were, in part, a permission to hear and think
idiosyncratically, and with mind, ear, and heart. He also was the first to
lead me to read Edward Dorn, who in turn led me to Duncan, Olson, and
Creeley, and indirectly to much of my work since. I rather think he didn't
approve of places I eventually got to in reading and writing, but I know
that in a way he helped me get there. He certainly had his blind spots, and
some found him arrogant, but mostly I found him challenging in a rather fine
way. He gave quite a lot of himself to students who were curious.

Subject:      Re: newpoets

My new neighbor Jeff Hansen (next town over) correctly puts up against Ron
Silliman's "bland abstract lyric" charge poets such as Juliana Spahr and
others. I might add Gary Sullivan, Myung Mi Kim, and more. But Jeff also
seems to pit, against "bland abstract lyric," "the wild blue yonder school
of poetic innovation." While I don't share the implicit distrust of "the
new" which Jeff manifests here, I also like to think that there's lots of
room for liveliness within forms and practices which have been around awhile
or which may be rather quietly innovative and which may not quite merit
"wild blue yonder" status. Is bland vs. wild blue really the dichotomy we
see? Aren't there lots of other choices? Doesn't ear still count for a lot
in making even the most abstract lyrical work rise above blandness?

Nice to hear/read/see you here, Jeff.

Subject:      Golding/Bernstein/APR

Last week, Alan Golding wrote:

Burt K. mentioned Hank's APR essay. I actually think APR has always been a bit
more eclectic than it's given credit for, but its eclecticism has less the
quality of a commitment to multiple writing practices, more the quality of the
startled twitch that one gives when one is suddenly woken up. ("Oops, looks
like we'd better pay attention to this, even if we are 15 or 20 years late.")
To put this another way, it's not yet clear to me that we're seeing, in APR,
more than a kind of belated tokenism attached to one of the big names of LP.
Charles is acutely attuned to these institutional/literary-sociological
issues, it seems to me. I don't agree, then, Burt, that APR has published work
of his in a traditionally APR mode. The poems they've carried are, in my
reading, progressively more blatant gestures of resistance to and satires on
that mode. If the editors don't get it after publishing the last one,
"Memories," then I feel sorry for them. (And if they've already gotten it and
aren't letting on, then good for them.) The real test for APR will be to see
if they start publishing lesser-known or under-published "experimental"
writers, as they do with their flush-left-first-persons.

--AG doesn't mention that a chapter in his book _From Outlaw
to Classic_ (U of Wisconsin, 1995), deals with this very subject
in some depth--Bernstein, APR, and the subversive nature of his
appearances there. (Chapter 5, "Provisionally complicit
resistance"). Good stuff--

1) As an old and still/continually emerging poet, I wonder at this
tendency to equate -- new=emerging=young

I know for a fact that I am not the only old poet writing new poems that
are in no books -- similarly, I know many young poets writing old
poems,,, and new poets who don't emerge at all --

but I'm always willing to listen to good old fashioned intergenerational

_Against the American Grain_ -- look it up if you haven't already seen it
-- she looks at Williams, Wright and Guillen -- (to my mind she makes
Guillen more interesting than his poems -- that's N. Guillen, not J.
Guillen) --  Special issue of _Callalloo some years back had lots of good
Wright stuff in it.

and this isn't much of an answer: kind of in the: read him? I haven't even
taught him yet! vein.  That is: I've taught Wright's poetry a few times at
the undergrad level, but don't feel I have a very adept sense of what he
does, though I know the Kutzinski stuff on him which I think is good.  It's
interesting, I think, to speculate on why Bloom and Hollander are such big
champions of his work--some of the later stuff is ahem "visionary" ahem but
lacks the tonal mobility and fugitive irony I'd associate w the work of a
lot of the poets on this list.

Alan (Godling?) are you out there today?  You probably read and teach
Wright, no?

I've often wondered if the serial poem is the defining poetic of the late 80s
early 90s, more than the lyric. May have to do with publishing opportunities.

Subject:      David Jones

   I was delighted to see the topic of David Jones crop up as
I've been spending a lot of this year (his centenary) thinking about
him. A couple of weeks ago Alan Halsey (of the Poetry bookshop Hay on
Wye) and I gave a joint paper on Jones as illustrator of The Ancient
Mariner and we could see the impact Jones was making on an audience
relatively unfamiliar with him. Members of this list might like to
know that a collection of essays based on a conference held here at
Warwick last April (I was one of the contributors) is due out
sometime next year, edited by Paul Hills. There was also a conference
at Lampeter last weekend, to which I didn't go, but something might
well emerge from that. Seren Books have two new books on DJ due, and
two exhibitions (one in London, one touring) will be opening in a
matter of weeks. I can supply further details to anyone who
might be interested.
   It's a good time just now to be interested in DJ and
he seems no longer the property of a narrow circle of admirers. And
at a time when the poetics and politics of "innovation" seem to be
faltering it may be timely to look again at some of his diagnoses of
the predicament of modern culture. What are the parts (which must be
kept from going sour) to which revision as a solo mission doesn't
reach? If he failed to appreciate, or greatly mourned that culture has
to be about forgetting, he teaches us how to recognise the fragments
that work up through that process in unfamiliar patterns which
reoriginate attachment.

From:         Mark McMorris <Mark_McMorris@POSTOFFICE.BROWN.EDU>
Subject:      Re: bland abstract lyrics

Yet another act of delurking (=lug rude kin):

1) Bland of course is in the eye of the beholder, but I suppose one means
poetry that is monotonous, unmodulated *and* unaccented, clever rather than
perceptive, perceptive rather than selective, meandering rather than
directed, vague, hubristic, histrionic, picture-postcard dull--in short,
metrically and procedurally commonplace. A few queries: is the abstract
bland? Can there be a non-bland abstract (there can be a non-abstract
bland, as we know)? By abstract are we to understand a bad case of
conceptual manipulation a la late Stevens (without his ear or eye--or
brain, for that matter)? Is The Triumph of Life bland? Abstract? (Yes on
both?) Is Stein's Tender Buttons abstract (I assume it's not bland)? Is
Cesaire's Ferraments abstract? (No) Is it conceptual? (Yes) Lisible? (no)
Scriptible? (yes) Moving?

2) I know that procedural ingenuity or formal obliquity has produced most
of the interesting (to me) poetry in the US in the last 50 years, but if I
am to make any sense at all, I must also say that the very same poets who
opened up and kept open the still lively and living (a pesky romantic
metaphor) forms of poetry around today themselves could be world-class
bores. Being dull seems to be an occupational hazard of innovative
writers--am I quoting here?--who venture into areas to invent them and on
happy occasions (e.g, A-12, Prelude) are able release poetry, on other
occasions (e.g., A-12, Prelude) fail miserably to make anything happen that
hasn't already happened elsewhere to greater effect (in conversations with
Celia or Paul, for instance, to which I am not privy). Who can read
Paterson through without a shudder of dismay? Williams and Zukofsky were
onto something that became important for US poetry in the years after them
and one might well tolerate the bland in "A" in order to arrive at the
sense of design in small matters as well as in large that Zukofsky
undoubtedly (to me) managed to build in. What does this have to do with
poets writing now? I suppose I'm trying sneakily to suggest that in a
survey of any today one must expect a certain amount of the bland, but that
it would be very unlikely if the Americas in 1995 were uniformly anything,
let alone bland. Let's say that an attention to syntax and
decontextualized, rigorously anti-mimetic linguistic subversion/resistance
characterized the underground now overground practice of the recent US
avant-garde. Younger poets writing now, some say the emerging poets, would
I think both profit from this massive exploration of poetry as
unwarrantable language given a welcome charge of distinct audibility, and
want to refuse it in specific ways and parts, just as a reader might wish
Zukofsky had cut some of the beginning of A-12 for poetry's sake (I hope
that expressing such a wish in order to make a point does not mark me as
narrow-minded or condescending--I admire Z and find his poetics both
meaningful to my efforts and succinctly comprehensive). Such a refusal
might well produce boring poetry if it takes place in a vacuum of further
ideas, but imitating somebody else's practice certainly would (and does)
produce boredom all round.

It also seems to me that bland lyrics is a fairly good description of the
bulk of poetry of any period (including American poetry since the war).

3) By concealing artifice, Williams' respected example has helped to excuse
the general neglect of rhythmic design--in the phrase, line, paragraph, and
work--in contemporary American avant-garde poetry (but see At Passages, et
al.), and therefore, together with Moore and Pound, can be blamed for the
later standardization of voice at the expense of arrangement, perception at
the expense of rhythm, which absolutely guarantees bland poetry. Recent
comments against Williams on this list seem to want to shoot the messenger
of an American voice--one seemingly without art--now that Williams has been
so clearly exposed as the "thoughtless" message in much contemporary
writing. This is unfair. Taking a different direction, I would say that the
fault lies not with the doctor but with the glut of words masquerading as
idea in the discourse on poetry and on literature generally, or with the
loss of -- an energizing loss, looked at in a certain way -- generic
boundaries. Does the word poetry name anything apart from a context of
presentaion? Tell me that the answer is YES. If I am a poet, I must suppose
that I am not writing a context of presentation but a poem. How can I know
that this is so? Circles make me dizzy. Here again, the doctor of Paterson
must take some of the responsibility for at once opening up a wider terrain
of poetry and, one might say, thinning it out and confusing the workers. I
could (as you could) write a list of fairly recent books that work
excellently from the former without succumbing to the latter, but still
areas in Paterson (or Maximus) usefully diagnose the disagreeable vague
monotony some object to in poetry today. The trick, I suppose, is to take
the good and to leave the bad and the ugly...

4) But then again, ... (following up on Gale's remarks) are there any
monoliths? states? who gets to count as the younger generation? I can never
shake the feeling that all talk of generations, schools, movements in the
US will remain premature because of the sheer size of the educated
population. And that maybe what one could call a systematic synechdochic
substitution complex--a few people for a whole continent--prompts me to
continue talking about (non-)entities like the state of contemporary poetry
in the US. Oh well.

Subject:      Donald Davie

I guess the closest I came to Donald Davie was Alan Shapiro, who was
a colleague for some years; Davie claimed that before publishing any
poem he first showed it to someone who was older than he was and
someone who was younger, and that the younger person was Shapiro.

It seemed to me that Davie was following some sort of reactionary
spoor in the United States. He wrote admiringly of Yvor Winters, and
then went to Stanford; then he went to Vanderbilt where I suppose
there was still a lingering odor of the Fugitives, who in their
reincarnation as Agrarians were --well, let's say, as Jeffersonian as
Pound. Donald Davidson, and I mean Davidson, the Fugitive and the
Agrarian of the 1920s and 30s who went on living for decades--was
such a fascist that when admiring his poems one has that awful
feeling as if one were admiring Hitler's water colors. None of this
is applicable to Davie, of course, but his American wanderings had a
very odd pattern to them.

I was very put off by a piece that Davie wrote about Larkin some ten
years or so ago, in which he found fault with Larkin for not being a
romantic. It seemed to me it was like faulting Eeyore for not being
Winnie-the-Pooh.

Well George, normally whenever i mention david jones i get blank stares
back. or better yet bad jokes about The Monkees. and as Peter Larkin
mentioned it also seems to me that the critical circle around DJ is
growing rapidly - no longer restricted to Hague, Blissett, Dilworth, and
a few others - but that is a fairly new phenomenon.

I did try to get information about the Jones centenary last January on
the MODBRITS list, but i received nothing in reply. i am truly glad to
know there was a centenary celebration for DJ. And Peter, i would really
appreciate any info from the confrence you have, or even a few clues
about the upcomming publications.

i'm presently working on a paper on DJ for a course on MOdernist long
poems so am curious to see some new publications and some new approaches
to Jones. The most current work i've seen of late on DJ (i think) has
been Katherine Staudt (or something close to that) 's *At the turn of
Civilization*

maybe i'm a sucker for First World War Lit.
or maybe i know a good thing when i read it

Anyone who thinks that (Ron thinks that) Ketjak is the equivalent of the wild

Anyone who thinks that Alan Davies' Shared Sentences is a lexical wild blue

It evidently is continually to be restated: We are not in relation to the

concerning David Jones) "culture has to be about forgetting [and then] to
recognize the fragments that work up through that process in unfamiliar
patterns which reoriginate attachment."

That is, group formation indexes itself through the ferocity of its erasures.
Its texts build back in that distancing within the "form" of the village,
setting loose a contingency that in the reading levels any implied authority
in terms such as "the new generation," "the old generation," "the new
sentence," "the old sentence," and particularly "the members of this list."

The remainder is paranoia.

Hi. Ken's been posting about this event and I've even had e-mail from NY
describing my photo on the publicity which I myself have not seen yet. A
few choice observations:

-      it would appear from the brief I got today that there is
considerable press and radio interest being generated by this event

-      the bill is too beefcake for my liking, with only 3/4 women poets on
a bill of maybe 15 performers (I'm told others are being added) / and don't
forget the winner of the poetry competition advertised on the leaflet
(which I haven't seen as I said, heck I'm merely reporting this stuff) gets
to read their poems from the stage alongside us 'alumni'. Made me want to
just invite a mass simultaneous reading from the stalls by all the losers
as my contribution  -  until that is the recent discussion about bland
abstract lyrics got into action

-      the promoter is going to spend somewhere close to =A330,000 of his ow=
n
money, and might well lose much of that

-      there are two programmes melded together (one offered by Iain
Sinclair as himself, Denise Riley, Brian Catling, Kathy Acker, cris cheek
and Aaron Williamson / this part of the evening will be introduced by
Michael Moorcock (I know, I know, it's seriously weird)  -  the other being
that of the 'official' poetry programme with names as Ken identified plus
I'm told at least an attempt to include Anne Waldman and others /
introduced by that sixties free wheeling drug baron Howard Marks!)

-      Penguin books are apparently going to produce a 'memorial' book of
the event and it's being filmed

-      for those curious about such things, it's going to presented kind of
rock-multi-media style  -  clip mikes being de rigeur and a giant screen
projecting on-stage 'images' of the performers as filmed by three cameras
in the hall

-      popcorn is not allowed in the building (despite which provision I've
agreed to take part), so eat outside

I'm just an old admirer of Jones. My wife is an expert, has the
patience etc. I just pick up items when I travel. Including a second
hand enormous book of the complete drawings tipped in, which I paid
500 bucks for once. So I am not up on the latest. In fact the latest
thing I attended was a couple years ago, the wonderful Eric Gill show
at Univ. of Toronto, just down the street from Dilworth. Did you see
that 1979 item published in Victoria , B.C. by Sono Nis Press? I dont
know whether it was also done in a UK or US edition. It is Henry
Summerfield's _An Introductory Guide to the Anathemeta and the
Sleeping Lord_   Gives references for all the stuff, stuff fr the
Niocene Creed, etc.I was lucky, snaffted that for 4 bucks!

hello,all--

i have a querry for you:
i have a very theoretical paper that i want very much to publish.  it is
rather non-traditional (read: non-academic), slightly non-linear, and fuses
prose and poetry.  it asks (answers?!) all those big questions like, what
is a writer? writing? poetry? a poet?  i rely on cixous and derrida (as i
am wont to do!) but include frost, poirier, dickinson, plath, and woolf,
too.  most of these are allusions; the paper is very much mine.  it is a
position paper, i guess, and does not really consider pedagogical issues,
nor is it very empirical.

i am considering trying it at either _the american poetry review_ or
_critical texts: a review of theory and criticism_.  my question to you
all is: does anyone know anything about these journals?  are the
reffereed?  do they have a wide/national circulation?  a good reputation?

i am btw. that rock/hard place with this one, in that it is fairly
un-traditional, and yet as an academic, i need publications!  i think it
is  valuable paper--but i fear that more traditional journals are not
appropriate; but then again, i cannot go too far off the beaten path, and
satisfy the academy!


i thank you in advance for your input--backchannel me if you'd rather--

the other day a friend and i heard in one of the old bars around here.
but like wcw's world generally, the accent's gone. -ed

As DJ seems to be stirring an interest (and thanks to Larry Price for
inserting him into the Wild Blue Yonder discussion) let me tell what
I know for anyone in or visiting the UK over the next few months.

  Two exhibitions: DJ: a Map of the Artist's Mind
    Glynn Vivian Gallery, Swansea 30 sept-12 Nov
    Hove Museum, Hove, 19 Nov - 28 Jan
    National Museum,Cardiff 17 Feb - 14 April

 DJ: A Centenary Exhibition Wolsey Fine Arts, 12 Needham Rd,London
 25 Oct - 25 Nov (catalogue already available)

   Three new books:
   DJ: Ten Letters Agenda Eds Feb 1996 (but priced at stlg70!)
   DJ: a Fusilier at the Front ed. A.J.Hyne, Seren  Sept 1995
   DJ: the Maker Unmade, By J Miles & D.Shiel, Seren  Nov 1995

   Also not yet announced:
   DJ: Artist and Writer ed Paul Hills , Avebury, Spring 1996
   This will contain a new paper by Kathleen Henderson Staudt who has
written (I agree with Graham Sharpe on this) the best book on DJ to
date, "At the Turn of a Civilization", U of Michigan Press, 1993.Also
featured is a piece of Gallic esprit by Jacques Darras on the role of
somnolence in English culture.
  One last general point: DJ is most visible as a WW1 poet (though a
controversial one, given his treatment of war as a recurrent human
predicament,to be rememorated as much as resisted(( for a recent
theoretical reading, see Evelyn Cobley "Representing War" U of
Toronto P, 1993)). More immediate to me, though, are parts of
The Anathemata and some of the fragments in The Sleeping Lord,
especially The Tutelar of the Place, a wonderful trenchant statement
of the poetics of attachment but entirely of the present (DJ believed
art can only be of "the Now"). See my paper "Tutelary Visitations" in
Paul Hills above.
  Sorry for the Jonesian exactitude of all this.
  Peter

cris and Ken:

Here's hoping you'll both post something in the way of a report on the Albert
Hall festivities after the "reforgotten" appear October 16.

For those who haven't seen the flyer, cris gets second prize for best picture,
after Brian Catling, who looks like a cross between a postmodern monk and that
guy from the original Adams Family--was it Fester?--sans light bulb in mouth.
What is that you're smokin' cris?

For those of us--me--who know little or nothing about them, who are these
"counter cultural heroes"--as the brochure describes the "presenters"--Michael
Moorcock and Howard Marks?

Hell, I thought the only poetry celebrities in England these days were the
New Gen folks.  And not a one of them on the program.

The Blaserfest reports were entertaining and useful: great to have more of the
same in this case for those of us who can't get across the pond.

Dear Jordon,

Edith Sitwell cuttingly narrates the split between Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu and Alexander Pope in her biography of Pope.I'm not sure whether it
was in this  book that I read that the final blow for Pope's and Lady
Mary's mutually generative partnership involved the return of borrowed
bed-sheets, unlaundered.

In any case, Sitwell's bio ought to be read for its curious, long, dense
lists which are among the least banal texts I have ever had the pleasure of
reading. (see chapter XI, Fashionable, Life for these)

sincerely,
Lisa

Does anyone know of any commentary on Harryette Mullen's work--essays,
reviews, etc.--and esp., though not exclusively, on Trimmings? You can reach
me via my backchannel, provided you can get past the anal godling lodging in
my Poetic Briefs.

Since one or two threads of the WCW argument are still dangling, I thought to
mention a good essay Hank Lazer published a few years ago on different
readings of WCW among recent poets. (Hank, maybe you can post the ref.? I
don't have it to hand right now.) What's being debated, at the risk of stating
the obvious, is competing readings of WCW, not whether any given
characteristic is "really there" in his work. My memory is that Hank lays out
very well what different writers have recently found in WCW, and what
different texts they're drawn to in order to find what they need.

Tenney, I appreciate your faith in the breadth of my reading, but I pretty
much lost touch with Wright after The Double Invention of Komo, which I
believe was his first book. And after this bloody (in all senses) trial, I can
no longer read his line about "the broken field runner in the terminal"
without thinking of OJ and Hertz commercials.

Jordan: Chap. 4 of my book From Outlaw to Classic talks some about internal
differences/arguments within an embryonic poetic community in discussing the
first series of Cid Corman's Origin. This isn't the chapter's main focus, but
I do get into the issues somewhat. I agree that it's hard to find material
beyond the anecdotal (though that's always entertaining too).

& Steve Carll replies:

_Poetry Wars_ by Tom Clark dishes a lot of dirt.  Can't remember what press
it's on, though, or if it's still in print.

Clark's _The Great Naropa Poetry Wars_ was published by Cadmus Editions in
1980. Doubt it's still in print. Ed Dorn still won't be found on the Naropa
campus next door to CU.

Mary Oppen in _Meaning A Life_ has some stuff on George's troubled relation
to Zukofsky. More material can be found in the volume of his letters edited
by Rachel DuPlessis. Jenny Penberthy touches on LZ's relationship w/
Niedecker, & her cautious letters to Corman (ed. Lisa Faranda) add more.

Excommunications? How 'bout any history of Breton & the surrealists.

Guess we'll have to wait for Kevin's Spicer bio to hear all about how
Duncan/Spicer/Blaser et al. treated each other, & the seriousness of their
fallings out. Anyone present at the Blaser gig remembers Kevin reading a
George Stanley letter talking about Robin while George sat there on stage
grinning & squirming.

Who doesn't remember the ugly ruckus arising from RD's interruption of Barry
Watten's LZ talk. After David Levi Strauss dredged it up a few years later,
the pages of the local _Poetry Flash_ were filled w/ it. All of which did
have repercussions on who people talked to/read/published with.

Of course there's more. But even when serious issues of poetics are involved,
going over all this 'dirt' seldom rises above the level of gossip &
personalities. Guess I have doubts about the value of such a study.

Lisa: thanks for the papism. I forgot/didn't know Sitwell's book and will
trundle shortly to find it. Do you (does anybody here) read her poems?
They've always been brushed aside (when I bring them up) as
sort-of-second-rate Stein. Which doesn't seem quite accurate

When you forget something, when you erase it, aren't forgetting and erasing
modes of relating to that something?  Or, to ask it another way, doesn't the
past nonetheless come to presence, albeit as what is no longer present?

Subject:      Sitwell

Dear Jordan,

Naturally I do read Sitwell's poems, especially her early ones. They-- with
Swinburne-- have become permanent bed-side fixtures. I find Sitwell very
unlike Stein and suspect their friendship and mutual respect tinted
sitwell's poems for some readers. In any case, their projects are quite
different in intent. The detail of Sitwell's attention to the sound texture
of a poem-- the specific variability of effect of syllabic structure on
metre and rhythm-- is almost scientic in its precision-- and beautiful and
funny. Many fairly sophisticated readers apparently thought so before the
New Critics successfully deleted her from serious discussion of 20C poetry.
Maybe this had something to do with her extension of some of the premises
of decadence-- terribly unfashionable-- as well as her exploration of fairy
tale and nursery rhyme as literary structures. I've fantasized for several
years about writing on Sitwell, and hope to get at it some day.

Lisa

Yes, I'll be there as the list's own cub reporter, and will file a report on the

Michael Moorcock is a(n ex-) science-fiction writer who edited New Worlds
magazine and wrote a series of novels in the late 60s featuring counter-culture
anti-hero of the omniverse Jerry Cornelius. Lately he's been writing anti-porn
stuff with Andrea Dworkin. I can't remember who Howard Marks is/was.

There are a few of us hypertextual or machine-modulated poetry folk who hang
out hereabouts -- myself, John Cayley to name a couple.  The discussion turns

to subscribe to ht_lit.  Pardon the bandwidth, but it's been a while since
anyone posted that address:

Lisa and Jordan,

This is Kevin Killian speaking.  If you enjoy Edith Sitwell, I know you
will enjoy the forthcoming film "At Home with the Stars #3, featuring
Denton Welch," by the NY videographer Joe Westmoreland, in which I yours
truly play Dame Edith Sitwell in this feature-length version of the life of
Denton Welch.

I got to write all my own dialogue, dress up in fabulous clothes and
jewels, and welcome Denton into my London flat . . . serve him tea . . . we
discuss poetry and literature, and Denton's illness and death.  As I was
speaking underneath this wonderful jewel-studded turban, I believe I was
able to channel Sitwell's actual voice: she spoke through me just as Lorca
did to Spicer!  Only this is in living color, and pixel vision too.  Anyhow
watch for this show at an obscure art film festival near you early next
year.  However, Lisa, you are the Sitwell de nos jours, the Edith of
Vancouver, and your pudeur, wit and brilliance when reading will never be
forgotten by any who have seen you read; however, I had the right dress
(one of Dodie's) and headdress, so it is a tossup.

Did you know that Edith met, in the course of her career, not only Denton
Welch but Raquel Welch too?   XXX Kevin
