JIM ANDREWS AT SFU VANCOUVER
http://surrey.sfu.ca/webcasts

Here's a video/webcast of a talk I did on 1/11/2012 in Vancouver Canada
(where I now live) at Simon Fraser University. They invited me to give a 2
hour talk on my work for the people in the Interactive Arts and Technology
program.

I'm the only person you can hear, in the video, which is too bad. And the
video of the computer screen is sometimes out of joint with what I was
actually doing, but I guess it's better than nothing.

You can easily register for free to view the talk.

Patti Smith featured in the Janet Hamill Archive

The Janet Hamill Archive offers a rare glimpse into the life and work of =
singer/songwriter, poet and artist Patti Smith as seen through the =
letters, manuscripts, photographs and documents collected by Janet =
Hamill during her and Patti's 40-year-long friendship.

In 2011 Patti was awarded the prestigious Polar Music Prize, considered =
the =93Nobel Prize for Music.=94 The citation read:
=93By devoting her life to art in all its forms, Patti Smith has =
demonstrated how much rock=92n=92roll there is in poetry and how much =
poetry there is in rock=92n=92roll. Patti Smith is a Rimbaud with =
Marshall amps. She has transformed the way an entire generation looks, =
thinks and dreams. With her inimitable soul of an artist, Patti Smith =
proves over and over again that people have the power.=94

To the best of our knowledge, this collection contains the largest and =
most important gathering of unique Patti Smith archival material ever to =
appear on the market and includes over a thousand pages of manuscripts =
and typescripts relating to her National Book Award-winning memoir "Just =
Kids"; over 200 pages of correspondence with Janet dating from =
1970=962005; original photographs, artwork, posters, broadsides, =
ephemera and a wonderful early drawing by Patti of her and Janet, =
created in 1966. Additionally, the archive contains extensive material =
that documents the life and work of New York poet Janet Hamill.

Let me add to Jane Nakagawa's resume that she has a volume out from
Ahadada Books (her second? third?) and that we have PLENTY of copies
available via http:www.ahadadabooks.com and SPD.  In fact, if anyone
would like to come to Tokyo to take a few copies off our hands (after
first holding forth at the Writing Conference in Kyoto of course!)it
would be a blessing as our storage space is limited due to our growing
collection of marionettes and our roomy, and totally chic, Meikai
International Puppet Theater which has also been written up in the Japan
Times http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20111016x3.html. :-) Jess of

JIM ANDREWS AT SFU VANCOUVER
http://surrey.sfu.ca/webcast

Here's a video/webcast of a talk I did on 1/11/2012 in Vancouver Canada
(where I now live) at Simon Fraser University. They invited me to give a 2
hour talk on my work for the people in the Interactive Arts and Technology
program.

I'm the only person you can hear, in the video, which is too bad. And the
video of the computer screen is sometimes out of joint with what I was
actually doing, but I guess it's better than nothing.

You can easily register for free to view the talk.

Subject:      New Truck driver for February seeking contributions

Wind-swept hair, the vast open road, infinite possibility.

Poets (like truckers)... they're the backbone of our economy.

What I'd like to do for my stint in the driver's seat of TRUCK for the
month of February... is to step away from the stereotypes of (truck
driving) and poetics... We all have an idea of what a truck driver's like,
what a poet's like... but I'll bet there's so much more.

Everyone has the idea of a big, overweight, burly poet who'd really rough
and raw, but I'm here to invite one and all within the tri-state area reach
and beyond to climb up into the cab and prove that's not the case. I'm
betting that many of you just wanted to be poets. You wanted the freedom.
Or you lost your way and didn't know what else to do.

I read a recent survey that said a shortage of poets suggests an improving
economy. But back years ago, when many of us hit the road, poets made up
one of the largest occupations in the world. there were millions and
millions of us. That's a lot of poets in mobile purgatory--a lot of people
many others might never really see, except maybe through their rear-view
mirror.

I invite you to add to this picture of poet culture. Our task is before
us-- to portray "the integrity" of the poetic life.

Please send me something I can post. Help me ease the hours on end of
driving toward nothing in the middle of nowhere. I want to read a lot of
poetry.

Thanks.

G. E. Schwartz

For the postcard and a map:  http://www.artcat.com/exhibits/16091

et al Projects is pleased to announce a two person exhibition featuring
work by the artists :

Bonnie MacAllister and Rachel Blythe Udell

JOUISSANCE :: PLAY

*OPENING* SATURDAY FEBRUARY 4th (7-10PM)

ON VIEW FEBRUARY 4th thru MARCH 17

JOUISSANCE :: PLAY presents a jubilee of countercultural relics,
traditions, and taboo through this multi-disciplinary installation. The
interrelated works of these artists revels in interconnectivity, and
explores the ways in which we seek to expose the unnaturalness of human
isolation.

Moving through the exhibition we are at first removed as foreign guests in
this new environment but quickly become privy to and interact with its ever
complex movements.

We at et al Projects are thrilled to be working with these artists and
sincerely urge you to come experience these works in person.

et al Projects is currently located in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan
and is easily accessible from the A/C/D/B lines right off the 145th Street
stop. Right around the corner from City College and next door to Azucarera
Gallery.

Gallery hours are Friday-Monday 10AM-6PM (and by appointment)

This is an experimental strategy for a poetry and mixed media book that
tells a difficult story.

Furtherfield.org is a new media laboratory in London, UK with an active
online presence. Part of its mission statement involves promoting social
justice.

Furtherfield's announcement:

The Last Collaboration By Edward Picot

"The United States loses more American lives to patient safety incidents
every six months than it did in the entire Vietnam War." Edward Picot
introduces The Last Collaboration an art documentary book by artists and
poets Martha Deed and Millie Niss.

This work is a construction of Millie’s hospital experiences in the last
hospital she ever visited. The story is told through Millie’s notes,
emails, the daily diary she sent home, her posts on her Sporkworld blog,
her mother’s log, and Millie’s medical records.

These primary, often raw, documents are framed with medical notes and
clinical guidelines as well as the outcomes of two NYS Department of
Health investigations of Millie’s care.

Millie wanted her story told. She wanted an autopsy performed if she
died. Because of the autopsy, we have the story.

MONIKA WEISS AND ALAN SONDHEIM: EYEBEAM PERFORMANCE THIS SATURDAY


Alan Sondheim & Monika Weiss -- Enunciation
EYEBEAM Art + Technology Center, 540 W 21st St. New York
Saturday, February 4, 1-6PM, Eyebeam Project Space
http://eyebeam.org/events/alan-sondheim-monika-weiss [eyebeam.org]

    Feb 04, 2012
    Hours:
    1:00PM-6:00PM
    Free

    Eyebeam Resident Alan Sondheim and transdiscipinary artist Monika Weiss
    will perform Enunciation, a dual live video projection and sound
    environment in the Eyebeam Project Space on Saturday, February 4,
    1-6PM. Enunciation explores the notions of language, document, trace,
    mourning and history. Inhabiting a prolonged interval of time, Weiss
    and Sonfheim perform and record their respective process, which is both
    independent from one another and interconnected, an exchange tracing
    issues of mourning, lamentation, ecstasy, and the processes of writing.
    This experimental collaboration is a result of a longstanding
    friendship and intellectual exchange between the two New York artists.

I'm working with Bobbie Louise Hawkins on a Selected Prose, republishing some of her earlier fiction, and we are looking for the artist, Chuck Miller, from the Bay Area.   Does anyone have any contact information on him?

Thanks.

I'm a bit surprised and more than a little delighted that I'll be showing
Aleph Null (http://vispo.com/aleph) in Paris at the Sorbonne at the &Now
conference on innovative writing (http://andnowfestival.com) in June. And
three kind scholars will be giving presentations on Aleph Null. Thanks to
Leo Flores, Saemmer Alexandra, and Mark Marino for their interest in Aleph
Null.

I'm delighted that my scholar friends and the people organizing the
conference are interested in Aleph Null and in seeing it in a context of
innovative writing; after all, it is a visual piece, is more evidently a
work of programmerly visual art rather than of writing. But they are right
that it's useful to see it in a writerly context. My site is a writing site;
writing is what I've been doing for thirty years. The whole vispo.com site
involves many approaches to writing and its involvement with other arts and
media. And Aleph Null is indeed primarily a written thing; I wrote it in
JavaScript. The only parts that weren't written in JavaScript or HTML 5 are
the two logos, which I created in Photoshop, an image-making program. O ya
and also the 192 screen shots and the icons thereof. But they're
documentation of Aleph Null.

Poets are now also writers of zeroes and ones--but in the secret codes of
art! You are the code breaker--some imagination required!

Please backchannel any suggestions.

Hello!

Some fun news on the poetry front:

A few weeks ago, Paste magazine asked me to review a new book about Phish=

shows -- Mr. Miner's Phish Thoughts: An Anthology By A Fan For The Fans. =
The
kicker, Paste asked me to write it as a poem.

A book review as a poem. I was like, um...

One of the most difficult things I've ever written, but also the most
exciting:=20
http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2012/02/mr-miners-phish-thoughts-an=
-anthology-by-a-fan-for.html

How'd I do?

Thanks for taking a look,
Paul Siegell

Subject:      The Puppet Theater and the Computer Screen and Poetry and Art
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Since establishing my international puppet theater here in Japan, I've
begun to think seriously about the differences between the art that
takes place on the computer screen and the art that takes place on and
about the boards of my International Puppet Theater.  My puppets are
marionettes--hand-carved--that stand around a foot and a half tall.
They do exhibit that wonderful, balanced pre or post-human "grace"
that Kleist speaks of in his essay on the puppet theater.  When
manipulated correctly they seem uncannily alive and earn that
"presence" that Benjamin writes of.  In fact I think that's where the
difference lies: there is a human hand at work in puppetry animating the
aesthetic object in real time.  We see the dance, see/hear the poetry,
smell the linden wood of the puppets, heightened to a higher degree
because one step above the all-too-human poet/puppeteer.  I would say
that because of this, a masked, or marionettic poetry recitation in
which the poet manipulates the aesthetic object,  would be even superior
to the poet her or himself giving a "live" reading before an audience.
 The computer screen factors out "presence" and flattens
performance--substituting techne for the living, the improvisational and
the inspired--and techne alone is not nearly enough.  The puppet theater
with its unique qualities, brings the uncanny--the "presence"-- back
to poetry in the manner of performance it offers to the audience.  Jess

"THE CANAANITE GOSPEL: A Meditation on Empire"

Available from Country Valley Press/FlashPoint for $11.95

http://web.mac.com/countryvalley

email: countryvalley@mac.com OR alphavillebooks@verizon.net

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John report two stories of what
happened after Jesus of Nazareth died.  One story went on to conquer the
Western World.  The Canaanite Gospel proclaims the rejected story -- in
a multitude of voices low and high, imperial and insurrectionary --
Roman, Galilean, Jebusite, Greek -- familiar names among them, like
Lazarus, Herod Antipas, Mary Magdala, Barabbas -- but telling most
unfamiliar tales.  Ferocious, hilarious, deeply and richly imagine, The
Canaanite Gospel projects a world as new and undiscovered as it is also
disturbingly recognizable.

“Culled from First Century Texts and drawn from dozens of biblical and
secular sources, these 88 monologues tell a revisionist tale of what
transpired in Judea, Easter Week/Passover 33 AD and beyond during the
reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius.

“In the classical argots of Petronius, Rabelais, Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Lenny Bruce, Guy Ritchie, James Joyce, David Jones, Cockney and the
world's myriad cryptolects, The Canaanite Gospel strips bare the New
Testament canard of the Resurrection of Yeshu of Nazareth and pokes a
stick in the eye of the Synoptic Gospels.”

Portions of THE CANAANITE GOSPEL appear in the current FlashPoint
at http://www.flashpointmag.com as well as at

TEXTS AND TEXTILES

a conference organised by the Centre for Material Texts, University of
Cambridge to be held 11-12 September 2012 at Jesus College, Cambridge

The shared origin of 'text' and 'textile' in the Latin 'texere', 'to
weave', is a critical commonplace. Many of the terms we use to describe
our interactions with words are derived from this common linguistic
root, and numerous other expressions associated with reading and writing
are drawn from the rich vocabulary of cloth. Textiles are one of the
most ubiquitous components of material culture, and they are also
integral to the material history of texts. Paper was originally made
from cotton rags, and in many different cultural and historical settings
texts come covered, wrapped, bound, or decorated with textiles. And
across the domestic, public, religious, and political spheres, textiles
are often the material forms in which texts are produced, consumed, and
circulated.

In the light of the CMT's current research theme on 'the material text
in material culture', we invite papers which consider any of the many
dimensions of the relationship between texts and textiles. There are no
historical, geographical, or disciplinary limitations. Areas to be
addressed could include:

the shared language of texts and textiles - construction and
deconstruction: to weave, spin, stitch, knit, stitch, suture, tie up or
together, piece, tailor, gather, fashion, fabricate, mesh, trim,
stretch, wrap, unfold, unpick - challenges and problem-solving: knots,
tangles, holes; to lose the thread, iron out creases, unravel, cut, keep
on tenterhooks - pieces and fragments: rags, patches, patchwork, scraps,
strands, threads, rhapsodies, patterns, seams, loose ends, layers

the stuff of books
-       bookbindings and covers
-       incunabula - 'swaddling clothes'
-       medieval girdle books, book chemises
-       paper and paper-making
-       cutting, sewing, and stitching in and on books
-       scrapbooks, albums, collages
-       book ribbons and bookmarks
-       carpet pages
-       textiles in illustrations, frontispieces, title pages

textile texts - needlework and words: tapestry, embroidery, samplers,
quilts, hangings, carpets, banners - the needle and the pen - printed
textiles - sacred/religious texts and textiles - love-tokens, keepsakes,
charms, and relics - cushions, badges, handkerchiefs, flags, scarves,
uniforms, livery and other textual/textile ephemera - professional and
amateur work - relationships and networks of gifts, patronage, exchange
- pattern books, sample books, costume books


Proposals of up to 25O words for 20-minute papers should be sent to
Jason Scott-Warren (jes1OO3@cam.ac.uk <mailto:jes1OO3@cam.ac.uk>) and
Lucy Razzall (lmfr2@cam.ac.uk <mailto:lmfr2@cam.ac.uk>) by 30 April 2012.

Jesse,

A very interesting and relevant essay. But marionettes also have techne
involved. The movement of human "like" objects pulled by strings follow
laws of physics as geometry. Similar uncanny effects were created about
twenty years ago when for the first time watched the street dance we called
robotics before some of its movements became mainstream. I also experience
Leger's paintings the same way.

For me your essay sustains the dichotomy between machine and human whereas
the conflict the computer --therefore purely digital works- creates is
between what we call "real" and virtual, in other words, object and image.
In my view, digital art -as movies, photography, and even T.V.-- require an
understand the nature of images.

Ciao,

Murat

How are these in any way different from paintings? They can all be seen
within that framework, it seems to me.

The Tenants

These barren rooms dead
poets lived in, the rooms
that stank of fish and low
tide, leaking gas and cordite;
rooms for body baggers
and touts pimping death in
a black dress sheer as crepe
and twice as toxic as the lavender
cocktails they toast each other
with once their mark has been
selected and the dirty deed done,
daily quota filled, ghost ships
dispatched from a shadowy
harbor, all the mates recruited
for that voyage that never ends;
rooms no one enters, not even
the landlord, everything prearranged
long before arrival, long after
departure; nothing ever changes,
not even the faces inside or the stains
they leave behind on the walls.

Excerpts from Impossible Books
The Crawdad Cantos
by Stephen Brockwell
$4

    from The Evangelical Handbook for Engineers

    A Primer for Drainage

    What is the first article and axiom of our discipline?
    That God made the Earth, the sun and moon, the stars
    and everything that lives in and on his chosen sphere.
    Therefore, no calculus of planetary orbits disproves
    his dominion, no quantum mechanical uncertainty
    casts doubt on his eternity, unlike the life of a cat in a box.
    The testimony of experts does not negate his Testament.
    He is the universal pendulum, the platinum-iridium bar,
    the krypton-86 emission in a vacuum, the beam of light from which
    a tiny moment measures out our microcosmic span.
    Among time and distances, he is the absolute constant,
    the being that lets being be  and every culvert,
    aqueduct, conduit, sluice, grate, trench and duct
    merely drains the ephemeral projection of his eternal tears.

A very interesting and relevant essay. But marionettes also have techne
involved.

[Given: In the service of the "presence" of the unique performance of
the marionettes, and the puppet master, albeit not in the same manner,
and to the same degree as the "flattening" effect of the screen in
computer art.  This is one of Kleist's points.  Techne--or
virtuosity--is displaced by the physics (and the inevitability) of
marionettic movement. Physics and Geometry are not in themselves techne,
as you seem to hint, but are abstractions based on what we seem to
understand of natural laws.  On the other hand, the conscious working
out of geometrical theorems or phyics equations, would allow the
expression of various degrees of virtuosity, and would be occasions for
a display of techne.  The center of gravity of the puppet body is
achieved through the construction of the marionette but is not in itself
a display of techne--the inevitability of the sophisticated (albeit
artless) movement of the marionette supersedes the skill (techne) of the
puppet master, to ultimately achieve the uncanny. On the other hand,
computer art dispenses with presence and the uncanny and relies on a
presentation of skill and indeed is often accompanied by a narrative
which emphasises and even enumerates the skills involved in its
production.  Q.E.D. Techne takes all.

Your example of the robotic dancer shows me that you are not following
the argument.  Look at Kleist's essay.]

You said: The movement of human "like" objects pulled by strings follow
laws of physics as geometry.

Leger's paintings the same way.  [I'm glad to see that you experience
the uncanny in Leger.]

You said: For me your essay sustains the dichotomy between machine and
human

[That was my point, and in fact I assert the superiority of the
marionettic over computer art because it provides presence and its
co-efficient uncanniness, whereas computer art only provides us with
various displays and narratives concerning techne--skill--virtuosity.]


whereas
the conflict the computer --therefore purely digital works- creates is
between what we call "real" and virtual, in other words, object and
image.

[That's another ball of wax, as they say.]


In my view, digital art -as movies, photography, and even T.V.-- require
an
understand the nature of images.

[Please clarify this: "require an understand"???]

Regarding the "Visual Poetry with Lettristic Elements," I join Murat with =
lots of questions. As a person closely associated with French Lettrism, my=
 first question has to do with understanding the term Lettristic, which I =
have not seen used before (usually you are or you are not, but not "-ic");=
 I hope to hear more, perhaps back-channel, from Jesse Glass. That said, i=
t should be stated that visual poetry has long since become an accepted fo=
rm of the intermedia, blurring the lines between poetry and painting. The =
language of this poetry moved away from Roman alphabets via Lettrism and H=
ypergraphics, and often is no longer "readable" in a traditional sense. Fo=
r some current examples in an allied movement, see Angelo Merante's work (=
recently via facebook postings). However, I am like Murat unsure what the =
Lettristic elements of Jesse's works are.=0ABest,=EF=BB=BF=0ADavid=0A=0ADa=

Maria,

The root of the word content (tent) also comes from the same place
"tentere." In India, "tantra" ("weaving," "music") also means "content,"
pointing to the different concepts of content in the West and in the East.
In the West, it is something *con*tained, limited. In the East, meaning is
process, movement.

Ciao,
Murat

LRL e-editions <http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/> is pleased to announce
the publication of Hugo Garc=EDa Manr=EDquez's *Painting Is
Finite*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/?page_id=3D64&Go=3Dview>
 and Sarah Mangold's* I Meant To Be
Transparent*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/catalog/sarah-mangold-i-mean=
t-to-be-transparent>
--
two books which, in taking their cues from other mediums, turn the language
of the portrait inside out:

*Painting Is Finite* <http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/?page_id=3D64&Go=3D=
view>
In *Painting Is Finite*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/?page_id=3D64&Go=
=3Dview>,
Hugo Garc=EDa Manr=EDquez traces the edge of elemental life via elemental f=
orm.
First published in Spanish under the title, *Los Materiales* (Mexico City:
Fonda Editorial Tierra Adentro, 2008), this volume presents Manr=EDquez=92s
first English-language collection. In these poems, memory is a verb: it
=93behaves in both directions / the result that it casts / the present, tha=
t
is, mobility=94 so that =93nothing that preceded you / has prepared you for=
 the
experience / =91the return of painting.=92=94 In such a return, we confront=
 the
incommensurable as a material surface, likened here to the written:
=93history is the only matter excreted by / that which dies,=94 and thus
=93Newspapers seek volunteers for the shadow on the front page.=94 This poe=
try
inhabits the edges as a vocation, urging us into relation with *the
materials*.

*I Meant To Be Transparent*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/catalog/sarah=
-mangold-i-meant-to-be-transparent>
=93It was more like an impressionist portrait than an identification photo=
=94
writes Sarah Mangold in *I Meant To Be
Transparent*<http://littleredleaves.com/ebooks/catalog/sarah-mangold-i-mean=
t-to-be-transparent>,
a book woven through the writing of early 20th century literary innovator
Dorthy Richardson and the contours of contemporary poetics. Taking her
title from a line in Robert Duncan=92s *Ground Work*, Mangold=92s attempted
transparency slips original language between filmic jump cuts that mirror
Richardson=92s own prose and a near pre-raphaelite interleaving of fore and
backgound =97 bringing the silenced, the skirted, the sidelined into view. =
By
troubling the implications of linguistic transparency, Mangold challenges
the literary portrait in a world in which "men and women are taught from
the beginning to speak =93his=94" and likewise suspending the space before
=93feeling fades into thought =96=94 In this hovering between, Mangold brin=
gs
into focus the woman at the edge of the party with =93Lots of big big
revolution behind my eyes=94 and the ways in which the failure to be
see-through becomes it=92s own revelation.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Hi all,

I am doing research on a biography of Larry Eigner. I am looking for anyone
who might want to share stories or be interviewed who knew Eigner.

I am also looking for people to exchange ideas with -- specifically about
how Eigner's work coincided with Hart Crane's and ee cummings, the Black
Mountain Poets, and how Eigner's work did or did not inform so-called
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry.

If any one has any stories, articles, or thoughts to share - please
backchannel me.

ALSO:

I am looking for someone to sublet my Greenpoint Brooklyn apartment for two
weeks in late July-early August. It's a really nice (small) three bedroom
with a yard across the street from Triple Canopy! It comes with two well
behaved cats. Price very negotiable.

Jennifer Bartlett

Jen, do talk to Bob Grenier and Larry's wonderful brother for stories.
I have some, but you really need to
come out to the Bay Area and interview.  We all loved him.

Actually Dr. John M. Bennett defined the work in this manner. I'm not
sure if he's on this list but his participation would be most welcome
either directly, or forwarded.  A good discussion about Lettrism would
be welcome, David and Murat and anyone else who would like to take part.
 Every best wish,  Jesse

>Regarding the "Visual Poetry with Lettristic Elements," I join Murat with lots of questions. As a person closely associated with French Lettrism, my first question has to do with understanding the term Lettristic, which I have not seen used before (usually you are or you are not, but not "-ic"); I hope to hear more, perhaps back-channel, from Jesse Glass. That said, it should be stated that visual poetry has long since become an accepted form of the intermedia, blurring the lines between poetry and painting. The language of this poetry moved away from Roman alphabets via Lettrism and Hypergraphics, and often is no longer "readable" in a traditional sense. For some current examples in an allied movement, see Angelo Merante's work (recently via facebook postings). However, I am like Murat unsure what the Lettristic elements of Jesse's works are.

A Typewriter Poem by Clifford Hunt

Clifford Hunt's poem, "Oh Summer, Look," comes, he says, "out of my love =
of short works, old typewriters, and Courier font." For the last several =
years, he says, "I have been printing short poems in large Courier and =
placing them in the old Royal Typewriter that lives on our front porch." =
Several of Hunt's typewriter poems, including this one, have been =
published in the Half Moon Bay Review (California).

What strikes me about the poems, beyond their beauty, is their kind. If =
Walter Benjamin were alive and rewriting his famous essay, "Art in the =
Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1936), in and for our age, the age of =
electronic reproduction, I have to think he would attach what he so =
rightly called "the aura" to "Oh Summer, Look," coming out of the old =
Royal typewriter on Clifford Hunt's front porch. WS

Dear all,
I am finalising my bachelorpaper on Visual Poetry. Definition, situation
within literature and the arts and how to study it. And would welcome all
supporting material of this thesis. I have found literature, Bohn & Dencker
to corroborate the support of visual poetry into intermedia, but I have
found also - especially within Dutch & French literature - voices that see
it as a not serious 'spielerei'.
So all (yet un)published work to support an intermedial approach are very
welcome. Perhaps via backchannel.
My paper will be in Dutch, but I would want to work on an English MA paper
elaborating more in that topic and its modernist routs.
Thanks.

first question has to do with understanding the term Lettristic, which I
have not seen used before (usually you are or you are not, but not "-ic");
I hope to hear more, perhaps back-channel, from Jesse Glass. That said, it
should be stated that visual poetry has long since become an accepted form
of the intermedia, blurring the lines between poetry and painting. The
language of this poetry moved away from Roman alphabets via Lettrism and
Hypergraphics, and often is no longer "readable" in a traditional sense.
For some current examples in an allied movement, see Angelo Merante's work
(recently via facebook postings). However, I am like Murat unsure what the
Lettristic elements of Jesse's works are.

Jesse,

I had not read Kleist essay for many years, so I looked it up again. You
are right. I misunderstood your direction. But, in the essay, Kleist talks
of the soul involved in the "simple movements" of the marionetteer, either
a direct line or an ellipse. The ellipse reminds me of the ellipsoid my
movements in the city made when I was a child in my memoir/essay "Istanbul
Noir." You replace, if I follow you correctly, the soul with the uncanny
which are not exactly the same thing, at least to me.

The way Kleist describes the "innocent" movement of the puppets against the
boards reminds me very much of Robert Bresson's idea of non-actors,
"mechanical and free. (You should read my recent poem *The Spiritual Life
of Replicants *which came out recently. You may find it provocative along
the same lines.)

I agree with you, in a lot of digital art there is a desire to remove the
human element in its creation as much as possible. Of course, we will be
accused of misunderstanding that work which to some extent is true. I hate
the complexity of digital works, the theoretically infinite possibilities
it open before us -as opposed to the marionetteers simple gestures of the
soul.

Ciao,
Murat

TENDENCIES: Poetics & Practice
Kate Bornstein, Kaplan Page Harris, Camille Roy

Wednesday, February 15 at 7 PM
in the Martin E. Segal Theatre,
CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, NYC

What are the new poetics and the new manifestos? What do authors actually
do when they write, and what can be learned from their investigations? This
series of talks, titled in honor of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, explores the
relationship between queer writing/artmaking process, pedagogy, and the
manifesto.

Kate Bornstein is a performance artist, college & high school lecturer, and
advocate for teens, freaks, and other outlaws. She has written several
award-winning books in the field of Women and Gender Studies, including
Gender Outlaw and My Gender Workbook (an updated edition is forthcoming in
2012). Her 2006 book, Hello, Cruel World is an underground best seller. May
1st sees the release of her first memoir, A Queer and Pleasant Danger, from
Beacon Press. She has earned two citations of honor from the New York City
Council and garnered praise from civil rights groups around the globe.

Kaplan Harris is writing a history of Bay Area poetry & activism in the
wake of the New Left. His recent work is found in American Literature,
Contemporary Literature, Jacket, Jacket2, Open Letter, Paideuma, The Poetry
Project Newsletter, Postmodern Culture, and Wild Orchids. He is also
editing, with Peter Baker & Rod Smith, The Selected Letters of Robert
Creeley for the University of California Press. He lives in Buffalo, NY.

Camille Roy is a writer and performer. Her most recent book is Sherwood
Forest, from Futurepoem. Earlier books include Cheap Speech, a play, from
Leroy, and Craquer, a fictional autobiography from 2nd Story Books, as well
as Swarm (two novellas, Black Star Series), among others. She co-edited
Biting The Error: Writers Explore Narrative (CoachHouse 2005, re-issued
2010). Roy has taught creative writing at San Francisco State University,
California State University SummerArts, and Naropa.

"Although the musical, linguistic, and visual are inextricably linked
and swirling around in my head, I think it=92s fair to say that for me,
music, the mutual friend of poetry and art, was the host who
introduced the two."

> In this documentary poem, Cecilia Vicu=F1a returns to Con C=F3n, the =
birthplace of her art in Chile, where the sea is dying and an ancient =
tradition is being destroyed. Con C=F3n is located at the mouth of the =
Aconcagua River whose source is the glacier of Aconcagua, the tallest =
mountain in the Western hemisphere. Named for the oldest deity of the =
Andes, the god Kon, it may have been a sacred oracle site for millennia, =
associated with the most renowned oracle site in the Americas: =
Pachacamac, on the coast of Peru.
> =20
> The word Con (Kon) alludes to the sanctity of the cycle of water-from =
glacier to ocean to cloud-a circularity intensified by the repetition: =
Con C=F3n. In the sacred Valle del Aconcagua, the "bailes chinos" =
created a powerful mystical sound: the "sonido rajado" (torn sound), a =
multiphonic music of the pre-Columbian Andes. Based on dissonance, the =
"bailes chinos" are ritual dances dedicated to increasing the =
life-force. Continuously performed throughout colonial times, the dance =
is now dying along with the sea.
> =20

New and On View: Mudlark Poster No. 99 (2012)

A Typewriter Poem by Clifford Hunt

Clifford Hunt's poem, "Oh Summer, Look," comes, he says, "out of my love of short works, old typewriters, and Courier font." For the last several years, he says, "I have been printing short poems in large Courier and placing them in the old Royal Typewriter that lives on our front porch." Several of Hunt's typewriter poems, including this one, have been published in the Half Moon Bay Review (California).

What strikes me about the poems, beyond their beauty, is their kind. If Walter Benjamin were alive and rewriting his famous essay, "Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" (1936), in and for our age, the age of electronic reproduction, I have to think he would attach what he so rightly called "the aura" to "Oh Summer, Look," coming out of the old Royal typewriter on Clifford Hunt's front porch.

Bob Pohl published an article about Mark Goldstein and me before our
reading for BIG NIGHT in Buffalo:

http://blogs.buffalonews.com/gusto/2012/01/toronto-poets-camille-martin-and-mark-goldstein-bring-lyricism-to-big-night.html

Interesting that he picked up that we both started out as musicians
since musicality in poetry is important to both Mark and me.

Cheers!

A Poetry Reading in honor of



Collected Poems of Gil Ott

Edited by Tim Peterson, Greg Laynor, and Eli Goldblatt

Please come celebrate the poetry and life of Gil Ott, a poet who published
over a dozen books and a community arts activist who worked with homeless
and disabled writers for over twenty years.  The founding editor of the
literary journal Paper Air as well as the original publisher of Singing
Horse Press, Gil influenced many poets in Philadelphia, across America, and
in the English-speaking world.  From 1981 to 1995, he worked at the Painted
Bride Arts Center, first conducting a capital campaign and assisting its
founder Gerry Givnish, and later creating an extensive network of
community-based arts and educational collaborations.  From the mid 90=92s
until his death in 2004, he served as the Director of Development for
Liberty Resources, Philadelphia=92s Center for Independent Living, which
advocates for the rights of people with disabilities.



Gerry Givnish will introduce. Julia Blumenreich, Gil=92s widow, will read h=
er
suite of poems that sparked Wendy Osterweil to make Reforesting: An Homage
to Gil Ott, an exhibition currently on display in the gallery.  Poets will
then read from the new Collected Poems.  Readers include Julia, CA Conrad,
Eli Goldblatt, Jena Osman, Bob Perelman, Tim Peterson, Ron Silliman, Brian
Teare, Heather Thomas.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE=20

RIM/WAVE

text by DAVID GIANNINI & woodcuts by FRANKLIN FELDMAN

ISBN: 978-1-935835-05-9

Perfect Bound, $18.00

Publication Date: January 2012

8 x 10 inches, 140 pages

PROSE POETRY/ART/POETRY

Rim is a man who works and thinks mainly with his body, a thinking

farmhand, someone who labors physically and sees through things to a

deeper level or core at times making spiritual sense also. Rim is a =
story, a

prosepoem, and a metaphysical investigation as one occasion. The sense =
of

poetry in the prose comes through both constant juxtaposition of images

and rhythmic qualities created through line-breaks and word-savorings.

Rim breaks down usual notions of inside/outside, linear/non-linear, and

creates a way of felling human =E2=80=9Cplace=E2=80=9D in a larger =
animate continuum.

This book is one of storied life and of collage. Each part of the story =
is

interrupted or disrupted by sudden insertions of words (in boldface) =
from

the separate books and authors listed in the Glossolalia (a pun on =
Glossary) to effect a =E2=80=9Cspeaking in

tongues=E2=80=9D throughout the work. This book asks the reader to =
follow a story and simultaneously allow

insistent =E2=80=9Cvoices=E2=80=9D to break in. Any presumed parallels =
to the disease of schizophrenia should be

immediately thrown out. The book may be read alone or read aloud by at =
least two people.

This volume also includes the first publication of To the Wave, Poetry =
at Seacoasts, a complete book in

honor of ocean and what sense of things the author has found on and =
around various coastal beaches

in the United States, including experiences of things both easily =
observed and not readily seen. It is a

lyrical, metaphysical and loving exploration made of notes, aphorisms, =
collages, poems and prosepoem

sections building (as waves do) toward final destinations. The title =
also indicates a way of bowing

=E2=80=9Cto the wave=E2=80=9D that is the next and the next physical =
presence within great ocean, but also =E2=80=9Cto the

wave=E2=80=9D that is the ultimate, imagined, engulfing totality anyone =
may feel and find.

DAVID GIANNINI=E2=80=99s most recently published collections of poetry =
include AZ Two (Adastra Press), a

=E2=80=9CFeatured Book=E2=80=9D in the 2009 Massachusetts Poetry =
Festival; Within Eternity (Feral Press/Prehensile

Pencil, 2011); and How Else? (Longhouse Publishers). His awards include: =
Massachusetts Artists

Fellowship Awards, The Osa and Lee Mays Award for Poetry, an award for =
prosepoetry from the

University of Florida, and a 2009 Finalist Award from the Naugatuck =
Review. He has been a

gravedigger, beekeeper, and taught at Williams College, The University =
of Massachusetts, and

Berkshire Community College, among others; and he has worked as a =
psychiatric case manager. Span

of Thread, a full-length collection of prose poems is due out from =
Cervena Barva Press in 2012.

FRANKLIN FELDMAN has worked in all forms of graphic =
art=E2=80=94intaglio, relief, serigraph, and lithography.

Indian Mountain Press has published a number of his limited edition and =
one-of-a-kind artist

books. His books are in the rare book collections of Harvard (The =
Houghton Library), Yale (The

Sterling Library), Columbia (Rare Book and Manuscript Library), Brown =
(The John Hay Library),

Princeton University Library, the Jewish Theological Seminary (Rare Book =
Division), and the Dance

Collection and Jewish Division of The New York Public Library. His =
prints are in public collections,

including the British Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum.

Available directly from Small Press Distribution, 1341 Seventh St., =
Berkeley, CA 94710, 800-869-

7553, www.spdbooks.org.

Hi all,

Boog City's pleased to welcome onboard our new poetry editor, small =20
press poetry luminary Buck Downs. I've known Buck and his work for =20
years and I'm real excited to see where he takes the paper's poetry =20
section from the upcoming 70th issue and into the future.

Buck's latest books are Black Peppermint and New Material (both =20
available at http://buckdowns.com/ ). He sends poetry postcards across =20=

the country and around the world every month, and posts occasional =20
essays at http://www.bucksmonthly.com/.

And a hearty thanks to Joanna Fuhrman, who just completed her second =20
term as poetry editor and is moving on to other endeavors, including =20
serving as co-poetry editor at Ping=95Pong =
(http://www.henrymiller.org/ping_pong.html=20
).

best,
David

Anyone out there need to part with/dump/sell a registration for AWP nest =
week in Chicago?  See tale of woe below, and please help if you =
can--Thanks-



ShaunAnne Tangney

As I was preparing for my trip to Chicago next week for AWP, I went to =
the website to print out a conference schedule, and read that =
registration for the conference is closed, and that no on-site =
registration will be permitted.  I am sure you are getting no small =
number of e-mail on this (!), but I find myself in a truly precarious =
position. =20

As you can see from the e-mail below, I was told that I would be able to =
register on-site, which made sense for me as I am only going to attend =
for one day.  That one day, however, is crucial.  I am a college =
professor and my trip is being paid for my my university.  I have =
already spent over $1,000.000 non-refundable dollars on airfare and =
hotel reservations, all of which would be reimbursed by university if, =
and only if, I am a conference attendee.  Indeed, by policy, I must =
provide a conference registration receipt in order to get my travel =
money.  But again, as I said, the money I have spent on airfare and =
hotel is non-refundable.  In short, then, if I do not attend the AWP =
conference, I will lose well over $1,000.00 of my own money.

Is there any way that I can still register--just for one day?  I =
desperately need to register for the AWP conference for Thursday, March =
1, 2012.  I will pre-register.  I will register on-site.  I will do =
anything I can in order to make this happen.  Indeed, even though I am =
very interested in attending the conference, I will pay the registration =
fee and not even attend, if I can simply get a receipt saying I paid.  I =
would rather eat the registration fee and miss the conference, that be =
out over $1,000.00 of my own dollars.

In 1991, the Albuquerque Museum presented an exhibition titled, "The =
Nuclear Enchantment of New Mexico." It consisted of forty 17" x 22" =
color photographs by Patrick Nagatani, and forty poster-size prose poems =
by Joel Weishaus. The theme of the project was New Mexico's extensive =
nuclear weapons infrastructure, which began with the designing and =
building of the first nuclear devices at Los Alamos, the first of which =
was tested in the air over southern New Mexico, and two of which =
destroyed the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.=20

After the museum show, the project split up, with Nagatani naming his =
photographs, "Nuclear Enchantment, " and Weishaus naming his texts, "The =
Deeds and Sufferings of Light."=20

Last year, The University of New Mexico Art Museum presented "Desire For =
Magic: Patrick Nagatani 1978-2008," which included twelve of Nagatani's =
"Nuclear Enchantment" photographs and twelve of Weishaus' corresponding =
texts. The museum also published a beautifully designed book of the same =
title, which includes the twelve pictures and texts.

Meanwhile, Weishaus placed "The Deeds and Sufferings of Light" in his =
on-line archive at Virginia Tech's Center for Digital Discourse and =
Culture. And now, for the first time in twenty years, the forty =
pictures, as 250x200 jpegs, have been linked to the forty texts [and =
paratexts]; thus, the original project is whole again:

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Friends: I am excited to announce the first travel/poetry series airing
on LINK TV. The show, ON THE ROAD WITH BOB HOLMAN follows the popular slam
poet as he discovers the roots of spoken-word while traveling the globe.
Along the way, he gets passionately immersed in the Endangered Language
crisis. Imagine Anthony Bourdain's "No Reservation," but focused on
languages!

I produced the show with my friend, Beatriz Seigner, and it has been showing
on LINK TV and on their website.

Episode one: http://www.linktv.org/programs/on-the-road-episode-1
Episode two: http://www.linktv.org/programs/on-the-road-episode-2
Episode three: http://www.linktv.org/programs/on-the-road-episode-3

After watching the show, please add comments on LINK TV's site.

Also, checkout the show's site at http://rattapallax.com/blog/on_the_road/

Lastly, join Bob and me for a screening, performance and party to celebrate
the show on Feb. 29, 2012 at 7pm at the Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery
(Between Houston and Bleecker), New York City. Also, catch us at AWP
Conference in Chicago on Saturday, March 3 at 4:30pm.

Hope to see you soon!

Cheers
Ram Devineni

BIO
Steve McCaffery, the David Gray Chair of Poetry and Letters at the
University at Buffalo, has been twice nominated for the Governor
General's Award and is the author of over 35 books and chapbooks of
poetry and criticism. This Exhibit X reading celebrates the re-release
of McCaffery's 1984 _Panopticon_ by BookThug Press, a novel hailed by
Charles Bernstein as "the exemplary 'antiabsorptive' work" and William
McPheron as an "extraordinary act of revolution and charity."  Taking
its inspiration from Jeremy Bentham's "Panopticon Papers," McCaffery's
_Panopticon_ is a tour de force of formal innovation, theoretical
comment, and narrative critique.

Join us for this celebratory reading!

The Spring 2012 Mildred Lockwood Lacey Small Press in the Archive Lecture
Series launches tomorrow:

 Tuesday, February 28th at 1:00PM

Julia Bloch, Assistant Professor at Bard College MAT

 "Epistolary Revision"

Bloch will be working with two instances of correspondence from postwar
women poets in The Poetry Collection: Lorine Niedecker and Bernadette
Mayer. Recently acquired letters from Niedecker to Kenneth Cox, which date
from 1966 to 1970, discuss Niedecker's late long poem "Paean to Place."
Letters from Mayer to Clark Coolidge contain two versions of a "dream
narrative." In both cases, Bloch is interested in the revision function of
the letter form.

Julia Bloch is Assistant Professor of literature at Bard College, where she
teaches graduate students in the master of arts in teaching program
inCalifornia's Central Valley. She holds a BA from Carleton College,
an MFA
from Mills College, and a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where
she received a Mellon Graduate Research Fellowship and co-coordinated
theModernism and Twentieth-Century Studies group. She specializes
in twentieth-century poetry and poetics, gender studies, and issues of
sound in postwar poetry. An article on gender and modernist genealogy is
forthcoming in the *Journal of Modern Literature*; she has published
essays, book reviews, and poetry in *How2*, *New Review of
Literature*, *Aufgabe,
P-Queue, Women=92s Studies Quarterly*, and elsewhere. She also serves as
co-editor of the poetics journal *Jacket2.

Howdy,

If anyone needs to cancel a room reservation at AWP, please email me.
Andrea Baker and I had an apartment there, but
they canceled at the last minute! We have a reservation at the fairmont,
but I walk like a turtle.

Forwarding this from Peter Anastas, author of the Olson memoir, From
Gloucester Out. He's asking us to:

"Sign this petition and forward it to friends, poets, Olson and
Gloucester lovers, who live outside of the city.  We are fighting hard to
save Olson's neighborhood from the development of a luxury resort hotel
at the Birdseye site, proposed by billionaire Jim Davis, owner of New
Balance shoes. If the Fort goes, so will the rest of the waterfront. Can
you imagine a high-end hotel in this iconic working class, ethnic
neighborhood? Olson would be turning over in his grave."

Subject:      the 4th issue of 17 seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics is
              now online:

Fourth Issue: Winter 2012

Gary Barwin - PLETE PLETE ME: A FEW THOGHT ON THUGHTS
Camille Martin - from "Blueshift Road"
Marcus McCann - No Permission: Why Poets Don't (and Shouldn't) Ask Nice
(originally presented as part of the first annual VERSeFest)
Pattie McCarthy - from marybones
rob mclennan - Insect hopes: Jay MillAr's accumulations
Sean Moreland - "another brain:" An interview with Sandra Ridley

(originally presented as part of the first annual VERSeFest)

http://www.ottawater.com/seventeenseconds/

seventeen seconds: a journal of poetry and poetics comes out as the
natural extension of the eight issues of Poetics.ca edited by rob mclennan
and Stephen Brockwell. Highlighting the diversity of voice, style,
practice and politic, seventeen seconds continues the resolve to provide a
forum for dialogue on contemporary poetics, with a focus on Canadian
writing. Over the past two decades, the amount of critical writing
published in print literary journals on Canadian poetry, specifically,
seems to have decreased dramatically, but slowly returned through a number
of online journals. seventeen seconds simply wishes to help strengthen the
dialogue and the ongoing conversation about writing through publishing new
writing, and conversation about new writing. How else are we supposed to
learn anything, unless we keep talking?

Subject:      Between Page and Screen release and AWP
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="Windows-1252"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

I'm very excited to announce the publication of Between Page and Screen, my=
 book of augmented reality poems created in collaboration with programmer B=
rad Bouse. A merging of the artist's book and e-poetry traditions inspired =
by both digital and concrete poetry, the pages of the book contain no text.=
 When it is opened before a webcam at http://www.betweenpageandscreen.com, =
however, the poems leap off the page in 3-dimensional space, and the reader=
 sees herself holding the words in her hands. The poems comprise a series o=
f letters between two lovers, P&S, pushing at the boundaries of their relat=
ionship, and a series of concrete poems that play off the etymologies of "p=
age" and "screen." Ultimately, the poems do not exist on either platform, b=
ut in the space between them opened up by the reader.

The first 250 copies are signed and numbered, and the book is available now=
 directly from Siglio Press (http://www.sigliopress.com/books/bps.htm--with=
 a 25% discount using the code SPINTO). (It will be available from DAP and =
Amazon in April).

It will also be for sale at the AWP bookfair and at the Siglio / Ugly Duckl=
ing Presse off-site reading on Friday night, where I will be performing fro=
m/with the book.

Details on the offsite with **Danielle Dutton, Jill Magi, and Erica Baum** =
are here: https://www.facebook.com/events/208796685885254/

Of the book, Christian B=F6k says: "Between Page and Screen has reinvented =
visual poetry. . . . Such a book heralds the virtual reality of our own poe=
tic future, when everyone can read a book while watching it play on televis=
ion, each hologram standing in its cone of
light, hovering above the open page."

And Marjorie Perloff says: =93Page, don=92t cage me!=94 declares one of the=
 lovers in this remarkable =93first of a kind=94 interactive print-screen b=
ook. Between Page and Screen . . . mysteriously opens up a new world with t=
he click on the computer screen, chronicling the misfortunes and misunderst=
andings of two star-crossed lovers, whose puns and paragrams resonate with =
a physical as well as semantic presence. Here, as Samuel Beckett said of Fi=
nnegans Wake, =93form is meaning and meaning is form.

Thanks! And feel free to backchannel me with any questions.
