How come when Goldsmith copies the entire New York Times, he is a conceptual
artist; but if one copied the whole text of a Paul Auster novel, for
example, one will be hit with a law suit? Doesn't such a conceptual work
depend upon the economic "valuelessness" of the first text in question? What
does that say about conceptual gesture of copying as a critical gesture?
But, if the person is ready to go to jail for his or for gesture, now that
would be conceptual art.

Maybe awfulness is more interesting than "aesthetic judgment"--& I'm
addressing the issue here & not "passing judgment" on the 2 works.
Release awfulness & let its spawn spread through the streets like so
many shiny beetles.

For aesthetic judgment, have we gone from "newness is value" (Christian
Bok)
to "newness is the major, perhaps only, value" (which is what Bok
implies
when speaking of Goldsmith)? That's where it slips for me.

Bobby, I think you've put your finger on something --- regardless of
Goldsmith's stance, I disagree with a basic tenant of conceptualist art,
that the concept is everything, or "the charge [is] in the concept" as
Mair=E9ad more elegantly puts it. The facility of the execution and the
richness of the end result maintain their lustre, and I think it is a
mistake for Goldsmith and his ilk to eschew these "traditional" values in a
fetishization of newness that belies the facility and the poetic richness o=
f
their works. For all of Goldsmith's boisterous contempt for originality, he
is producing original texts that are worth reading. That's right ... Kenny
Goldsmith's books are WORTH READING. Appropriation and recontextualization
is old hat, as you say, insofar as artistic tactics are concerned, but old
though they may be these tactics can still produce good work. In short, I
disagree with Goldsmith and consider a text like DAY both readable and
interesting, full of poetic richness. Johnson's DAY is not as interesting t=
o
me because it is a perfect example of the kind of empty conceptualism which
Goldsmith CLAIMS to practice, when in fact his writing is more interesting
than his soundbites regarding same. Of course, since the texts are
identical, Johnson's book is just as "rich" as Kenny's. But where Kenny
produced a "uncreative" and yet, in another sense, "original" poetic text
through the application of an artistic technique, Johnson is merely
satirizing Goldsmith's pose.

Jonathan





Or maybe you take Goldsmith's word for it that "In conceptual writing
the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an
author uses a conceptual form of writing, it means that all of the
planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a
perfunctory affair." If that's the case, then tell me, please, what
makes Goldsmith's idea interesting? Given that the same idea has been
had, and executed, by thousands of others, including Richard Prince,
Sherri Levine, and anyone who's "written" a found poem, why should we
see Goldsmith's project as any more or any less interesting than
Johnson's?

But here's a thought: what if the dismissal of Kent's DAY as
"superficially interesting" was exactly the point of his project? I
don't say that it is; Kent can speak to that (or could, if he weren't
banned from this list, though I'm sure he'll find a way to participate
somehow). But what if? What if one took the annoyed response to
Johnson's DAY as exactly the reaction he wanted, since it proved the
fact--which you may take to be obvious, but which no one seems willing
to publicly acknowledge--that there is a bright line between the kind
of people whose uncreative writing allows them to reap every reward
the culture industry has to offer=97publication, glossy magazine
interviews, fellowships and tenured academic positions--and those
whose *identical* uncreative writing gets them shunned as wannabes?
And what if that bright line has nothing to do with the work, or the
ideas behind the work, and everything to do with the fact that one has
gone to the right schools, lived in the right cities, and licked the
right boots? I think you'd have to admit that it's a superficially
interesting thought, at the very least.

Mime-Version: 1.0

There has been a new development in the Johnson/Goldsmith debate.=20
Charles Bernstein notified me to say that he had reproduced, in 2006,=20
Kenny=92s =91Weather=92 in full:

http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/blog/archive/weather.html

The inference being that Kent's doing the same with Day is passe. In=20
response to this new development Kent says:

=91Fascinating!
=20
There is an important difference, though. Bernstein announces that the=20=

work is by Goldsmith, and he seems to add his name in a playful sort of=20=

gesture, a kind of "afterthought" beneath "Kenny Goldsmith's The=20
Weather." It's a "half-hearted" ironic tweak, so to speak.
=20
I'm not doing that. I'm *erasing* Goldsmith's name and affirming=20
myself as the book's Author! I'm affirming (sardonic though the=20
affirmation is) the book as my "property." Which is to say that the=20
category of Authorship is bracketed in uncomfortable sorts of ways.
=20
Feel free to send this on to Charles.=92

Which I did. I won=92t quote Charles=92s full response as I haven=92t got=
 his=20
permission to do so. But he said that he used his version of =91Weather=92=
=20
in teaching a course on Goldsmith. And said the piece =91seemed more=20
fresh three or four year ago=92

Kenny=92s response to this is:

=91I think you need to spread this all over the place, Jeffrey. It takes =
the=20
whole discussion into a new area. Please quote my letter if you do so=20
at Poetics and your blog. There is simply no comparison.=20
=20
Charles *always* needs to be first! (note the hilarious remark about=20
how it seemed "more fresh three or four years ago"!)=92

Which is why I=92m posting it here.

I want to say that I'm not annoyed by Johnson's DAY. I am new to this list
and don't really know who Johnson is, he seems to have a longer history wit=
h
this list (somebody mentioned that he was banned from it, for reasons I
don't know about). I think his project is intended as a joke, but since it
is being presented and supported by some as serious work, I just want to
talk about whether or not it stands or falls as serious work. It certainly
succeeds as a joke.

Jack Collom was
born in Chicago in 1931. He studied Forestry at Colorado A&M
College and has been a birdwatcher since boyhood. His poetry (23 books)
is notable for its formal and informal variety. Collom has collaborated
extensively with other poets (especially Lyn Hejinian) and with
musicians=2C visual artists=2C friends=2C passersby=2C and schoolchildren.
Teachers and Writers has published three books of and about his work
with children. Perhaps his chief study for many years has been the
collaborative possibilities between poetry and nature. In spring 2008
he was a plenary speaker on this topic at the "Poetic Ecologies"
Conference in Brussels. He has been awarded two Poetry Fellowships by
the National Endowment for the Arts and is working on a ridiculously
large ms. called "Second Nature." Collom is married to writer Jennifer
Heath.

I think an important question is not whether it "succeeds" or "fails" as a
gesture, but at what cost.  In other words, perhaps it "succeeds" but not as
much as something else which "could have" been produced with the same time
and amount of effort, skill, and knowledge.  I think Badiou makes a similar
argument against what he calls the "constructivist" stance: not that its
statements are untrue, but that they are too slow.  It's knowledge, but not
action.  Hence, perhaps the value of this situation is that it makes us ask
a larger question about efficacy and goals in general.  Any takers?a

Gads, personally I love Goldsmith's work - find it impossible not to. And
thinking about the new, I remember Clark Coolidge talking about how great
it was to step across boundaries, look back.

There's no Goldsmith and his "ilk" by the way, maybe a "lek!"

Tonight (Friday, October 2, 2009, at 6:30 pm), we are lucky enough to =20=

have Eileen Myles, the sui generis downtown poet, novelist, essayist, =20=

and performer, =93my President,=94 as Erica Hunt recently said at the =20=

AdFemPo conference, for a couple of hours at the Grad Center, in the =20
English Department lounge, room 4406, during which she will read from =20=

her new book, The Importance of Being Iceland: Travel Essays in Art, =20
and then Corey Frost (me) and Erica Kaufman, both writers, doctoral =20
English students at the Grad Center, and fans of Eileen, will give =20
short responses to her work, following which there will be plenty of =20
time for questions, making for an excellent opportunity to discuss a =20
variety of topics, everything from melting glaciers, movie stars, and =20=

menopause, to class, gender, and barf, and a chance to talk to a =20
legendary writer, a vital part of the New York poetry scene from the =20
70s until now.

There are 30 commas in the one-sentence paragraph above, a surfeit of =20=

organizational punctuation that is more or less the opposite of Eileen =20=

Myles=92 semantically messy, often punctuation-free Steinian sentence. =20=

Her new book covers a wide range of subjects (travel, art, people, and =20=

poetry, for starters) and has two or three brilliant, casually =20
subversive ideas on each page, but each of the essays is unmistakably =20=

Eileen Myles. Each one feels like an improvised performance, as though =20=

the author didn=92t know she was going to be asked that question but is =20=

really enjoying the process of figuring out an answer. And the process =20=

is never a linear one. In the title essay, Myles gives various reasons =20=

for her interest in Iceland, but perhaps one way that Iceland is =20
important is that it seems so tangential to the way the rest of the =20
world works, and therefore a perfect landscape for such an ambulatory =20=

intellectual method. =93I=92m not sure if I=92m telling a story or =

the main thing about kenny for me is that he's funny. it's hard not to
enjoy laughing.  in my experience, which admittedly is limited, kent
johnson isn't funny.

hip-hop, the singer-songwriter tradition of troubadors such as Bob =20
Dylan and Lou Reed--the relationship between music, specifically jazz, =20=

and poetry has been percolating for generations. Sit in with these =20
artists as they discuss this tempestuous relationship in a rapid-fire =20=

Thanks Jeffrey, however I did read your post when you originally sent it
around. My original point is to take issue with your statement, as I claim
that there is nothing innovative or audacious about this appropriation by
Johnson. Its conceptual value is not to earmark thievery as art, or to
question categories of authorship --- both dry, boring notions by now ---
but rather to extend to its logical extreme the rhetoric of a conceptualist
like Goldsmith.

My point is that Goldsmith's rhetoric of conceptulist value being the only
value is already dry and boring. What makes Goldsmith's texts, such as DAY,
innovative and audacious works is the actual poetic richness of the texts
produced under these "uncreative" constraints, not the their conceptualist
underpinnings. Therefore, Johnson's act, aside from being hamfisted satire,
is just "more of the same" insofar as conceptualist writing is concerned.
Goldsmith makes use of conceptualist tactics to defamiliarize language (in
this case the language of journalism and advertising) through a reframing i=
n
order to produce poetic texts. Johnson is taking a work of conceptualist
poetry as his source, and turning it into more conceptualist poetry .... no
such radical defamiliarization of language has occurred (in other words, no
poetry is produced through a shift of the text's framework).

Moreover, the act by Johnson will not lead to legal action --- Goldsmith
suing over somebody stealing his previously stolen text .... the thought is
absurd. The original act by Goldsmith is the only one subject to legal
action. In any case, whether or not a poetic act is subject to legal action
is no source or guarantor of its artistic value.

What bothers me about comments like Johnson's remark on how Kenny's use of
conceptualist tactics is old hat, and Goldsmith's comments that writing is
40 years behind painting (itself an appropriation of a Brion Gysin quote) is
that they both make use of a false notion of progress. As if there were some
timeline extending into the future, and the arts were all racing to get to
the end, and attain their perfect and final forms ..... this is what I mean
when I complain of the fetishization of the new. The art world as a horse
race: "Painting takes the lead over writing, oh, and writing is left in the
dust!" Regardless of how "old" conceptualism is in the art world, it is
relatively "new" in the poetry world. And even if it wasn't, who cares? The
debate, to me, has nothing to do with who was there first or what is going
on in the visual arts. It has to do with which of two identical texts could
be considered poetically more interesting in light of the conceptualist
underpinnings of the practice which produced them.

Other aspects of the artistic practices of KG and KJ are worth considering.=
  KG has brought Abbie Hoffman's Steal This Book to vital and extraordinary=
 development in the stunning super-energizing panoramic UbuWeb.  He's also =
an A1 performer: live, on paper, and conceptually.  Ever seen/heard/sat =
under his Bern Porter piece?  I agree with Maria that he's a LOT of fun.  =
KJ is kinda fun too, and appeals just as heartily to some senses of humor =
as KG does to mine.  The work often seems mean to me, not just mean-spirite=
d but flimsy.  A lot of what KG is doing is energizing the poetry world by =
importing and writing (in VERY large letters) ideas from the art world.  =
KJ, to me, is a kind of policeman (CIA man?), setting off small bombs to =
injure poets, or at least crumple their horny toe-nails.  This policeman =
is an upstanding citizen as teacher and translator though, maybe he even =
loves poetry there.  But at night, he puts on his little cape, and runs =
round sticking needles into things .....YIKES now he's heading for me....

issues and minutiae of translation and inter-textuality.  Readings not to
miss!

It=92s 1349 on the fief and I=92ve got 163 holidays

my colleagues and their offspring know

Bastille Day is no holiday! so I just get

my joints scuffed because I go straight from

one demarcated zone without my species

essence to chaos: sweet, domestic, and high;

filling it with mescal and snuck smokes,

head out the window like a fucking

crane. some of my colleagues shrug about

=93every day a beating=94, it=92s all abstraction

and no nectar. Little lambs love to watch

their friends sheared. My batsuit. My shred

passports. My dead co-workers. Dead

on Bastille Day, weird.

*Brandon Brown* is from Kansas City, Missouri. Poems recently in *Brooklyn

*The Book of Decomposition*



It is in the tranquillity of decomposition that I remember the long confuse=
d
emotion which was my life.

Samuel Beckett, *Molloy*



Here the reader rots alongside of the book and its characters. A man in the
opening chapter pulls strands of hair off his head; the reader does the
same. A man feels maggots crawling all over his skin; the reader feels the
same. The book begins in a butcher shop that has been looted by poor bodies
that tear out cow intestines and unravel them in the dead grass behind the
butcher=92s shed. The bodies see books in the intestines whose characters a=
re
their mirror images, and the bodies grow terrified of themselves. They run
into the woods but they hate nature so they take shelter in the stables
where rotten bodies hide in the hay. The dead bodies in this stable are
countries and the protagonist says USA USA your assets are rotten you are
dying and Haiti your huts have flooded and your citizens kill for bread and
beans and New Orleans your bodies float in puddles of shit hey China your
babies are drinking poisoned milk and Mexico your peasants cannot hear or
see and in the USA the assets are rotten the Bolivians sell less coke on
Wall Street the Iranians don=92t have enough money to blow Israel off the m=
ap
the Russians can=92t build new weapons to sell to the Syrians and Venezuela=
ns
the Cuban doctors and prostitutes service bodies that live far away the
nations conduct business in body parts here are the legs of our citizens we
will trade you for arms and kidneys and here take these eyes and livers and
give us hearts and tongues and intestines. Full stop. Period. In the end
it=92s unclear if it=92s the reader or the characters who request some form=
 of
movement to free the bodies from the sorcery of global capital.
Nevertheless, the request is granted and the book ends happily with the
entrance of a saint who has so much love that he heals the sores of the
bodies with his tongue and prepares them once more to succeed as
cosmopolitan bodies in a ring of fantastically interconnected commerce. The
book ends with a giant ejaculation behind the butcher shop where the bodies
rub against each other as if there were no barriers to keep them from
consummating their fiscal intimacies. And in the final scene water streams
off the pages, cleansing the skin of the readers in a climax of diluvial
bubbling.

For me, Thoreau's going to jail for his civil disobedience (even if only fo=
r
a day) is a piece of conceptual art. In fact, he may be the first conceptua=
l
artist, at least, in the United States. That act itself is followed by
words, the essay "Civil Disobedience," which actualy isl a manifesto of
conceptual gesture transformed into political act.

Let's face it, neither Goldsmith nor Johnson expect to go to jail for their
acts. Both lack, I think, an element of risk. Therefore, essentially they
become conversation pieces as conceptual works. On the other hand, *Doubled
Flowering* is truly a conceptual gesture, and John has paid and is still
paying a price for it.

I have a question: how many on this list has read Goldsmith's work through?
Jonathan, have you read it through? I am curious how many of us are talking
about works that we actually read? What does reading of a conceptual mean?
Is it the same as any other reading? Jonathan, talking about the "richness"
of Goldsmith's text, you are implying that you have read it through. Have
you done so?

Ciao,

Murat

So much of the "shunning of wannabes" in these situational fiefdoms is =
hidden in judgments of "good."  Makes the whole business a bit silly.  =
So seeking an objective process to engage in may make more sense.  The =
products of applied concepts or objective procedures are often "awful" =
by conventional consensus, but "awful" is often more interesting than =
"good."  There's more than "entertainment value" involved.  The awful =
can yield insight and trigger creativity.  Some people become fascinated =
by melon molds and bat guano.

Bobby, I think you've put your finger on something --- regardless of
Goldsmith's stance, I disagree with a basic tenant of conceptualist art,
that the concept is everything, or "the charge [is] in the concept" as
Mair=E9ad more elegantly puts it. The facility of the execution and the
richness of the end result maintain their lustre, and I think it is a
mistake for Goldsmith and his ilk to eschew these "traditional" values =
in a
fetishization of newness that belies the facility and the poetic =
richness of
their works. For all of Goldsmith's boisterous contempt for originality, =
he
is producing original texts that are worth reading. That's right ... =
Kenny
Goldsmith's books are WORTH READING. Appropriation and =
recontextualization
is old hat, as you say, insofar as artistic tactics are concerned, but =
old
though they may be these tactics can still produce good work. In short, =
I
disagree with Goldsmith and consider a text like DAY both readable and
interesting, full of poetic richness. Johnson's DAY is not as =
interesting to
me because it is a perfect example of the kind of empty conceptualism =
which
Goldsmith CLAIMS to practice, when in fact his writing is more =
interesting
than his soundbites regarding same. Of course, since the texts are
identical, Johnson's book is just as "rich" as Kenny's. But where Kenny
produced a "uncreative" and yet, in another sense, "original" poetic =
text
through the application of an artistic technique, Johnson is merely
satirizing Goldsmith's pose.

Jonathan





Or maybe you take Goldsmith's word for it that "In conceptual writing
the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an
author uses a conceptual form of writing, it means that all of the
planning and decisions are made beforehand and the execution is a
perfunctory affair." If that's the case, then tell me, please, what
makes Goldsmith's idea interesting? Given that the same idea has been
had, and executed, by thousands of others, including Richard Prince,
Sherri Levine, and anyone who's "written" a found poem, why should we
see Goldsmith's project as any more or any less interesting than
Johnson's?

But here's a thought: what if the dismissal of Kent's DAY as
"superficially interesting" was exactly the point of his project? I
don't say that it is; Kent can speak to that (or could, if he weren't
banned from this list, though I'm sure he'll find a way to participate
somehow). But what if? What if one took the annoyed response to
Johnson's DAY as exactly the reaction he wanted, since it proved the
fact--which you may take to be obvious, but which no one seems willing
to publicly acknowledge--that there is a bright line between the kind
of people whose uncreative writing allows them to reap every reward
the culture industry has to offer-publication, glossy magazine
interviews, fellowships and tenured academic positions--and those
whose *identical* uncreative writing gets them shunned as wannabes?
And what if that bright line has nothing to do with the work, or the
ideas behind the work, and everything to do with the fact that one has
gone to the right schools, lived in the right cities, and licked the
right boots? I think you'd have to admit that it's a superficially
interesting thought, at the very least.

Bobby

In fairness to Kenny, I haven=92t read Day so I can=92t take issue with y=

borrowed verbatim prose texts do.=20

Even if it this were so, I=92m not sure that defamiliarising language is =

more than a novel use of punctuation would be. Nor can I see how your=20

opinion:

=91What makes Goldsmith's texts, such as DAY, innovative and audacious=20=

works is the actual poetic richness of the texts produced under=20
these "uncreative" constraints, not the their conceptualist=20

Both points seem to me incidental to the conceptualising of theft as an=20=

A lor of verbiage on Kent Johnson's taking the piss out of Kenneth Goldsmith, who richly deserves it as another one of those necrophiles brandishing (among other gestures) the cryogenically-preserved (freeze-dried?) corpse of a "conceptual" art sans concepts, sans art, sans eyes, sans everything.  But while I like the joke, is it really worth killing so many trees just to play one?

Killing trees?  Kent has merely killed a few stickers.  It's Kenny who
killed the trees; in this sense Kent's work, whatever one thinks of it
otherwise, is at least arguably a more "conceptual" project.....

Nick, I agree. I've been trying to get this across here, but I think peop=
le=20
just don't like Kent. I bet if Kent had done Day first and Kenny "stole"=20=

it and published it people would say "Wow, what a great idea!".=20

Regarding Kenny=92s artistic strategies=85. when he says:

=91On the contrary, we employ intentionally self and egoeffacing tactics=20=

using uncreativity, unoriginality, illegibility, appropriation, plagiaris=
m,=20
fraud, theft, and falsification as our precepts; information management,=20=

word processing, databasing, and extreme process as our=20
methodologies; and boredom, valuelessness, and nutritionlessness as=20
our ethos. If we appear to you as fads, then we feel we=92ve succeeded=20=

beyond our wildest expectations: we=92ll be yesterday=92s news by the tim=
e=20
you read this=92.

What sort of response is he expecting? If all he says is the case, then=20=

is it a case worth making outside of his wanting attention from it? I=92m=
=20
surprised no one can see though this.=20

Incidentally, Kenny still hasn=92t responded to my comment on Dale=20
Smith=92s blog left some weeks ago, regarding statements in Kenny=92s=20
interview with Dale. In that comment I said:=20

'I was rather perplexed to see Kenny so supportive of the idea that=20
anything should go in poetry, yet admit that UbuWeb is not a=20
democracy and that he decides =93what goes there=94, and that: =9399% of=20=

what is submitted is not accepted. But that=92s why it=92s so good. The b=
ar=20
is set very high according to Ubu=92s standards, which are quite rigorous=
.=94=20

Yet, I wonder what criteria are brought into play when deciding what is=20=

the best of =93anything should go=94, or arbitrarily collaged texts etc. =
I=20
suppose, there isn=92t one, and that it is all personal taste.'=20

Kenny refuses to comment on this.

We all kill trees. Killing trees is positive: too many trees = too much CO =
big problems for globe/warming trends.

Seriously tho, I'll go out on a limb, or perhaps not, and say this: I like
both ideas. I thought KG's idea was great and interesting (albeit, w/o
reading in full) and Kent's new piece also seems interesting, especially
relevant in an era when intellectual privacy, piracy and property is the
next big thing (those of you not following the piratebay.org lawsuit,
should). Goldsmith and KJ should celebrate together, they're pushing the
boulder along, smiling.

I will add that I think Johnson's project excels at what much of his work
seems to address lately: the destruction of "PoBiz" egos and hype. Certainly
Kent has created a type of anti-hype (not like anti-christ, more like
anti-matter), denying authorship of Doubled Flowering to this day...

I think Kent probably settled on this idea because of 1) DAY's concept
almost begs for "theft" and 2) Goldsmith's work has received a lot of
warranted and unwarranted attention. To attack something boring and unknown
is one thing, but to attack what everyone seems to be talking about, now *
that's* something. I think what Kent's piece says is not only that our ideas
on authorship are hypocritical (giving KG credit for something he didn't
"write," attacking Kent for something he most likely DID write, as if he
were someone else), but that once accepted, that pseudonymous work can
become sacrosanct, which would explain the hubbub here about KJ supposedly
defiling KG's work.

Jeffrey, to be perfectly honest what's mostly getting up my nose is
the smartarse complacency of the publicity, which is, I guess, the
point of the whole exercise. You can't measure artistic courage by
suability, or every tabloid journo would be Pound. Mind you,
Enzensberger did say once that the contemporary tabloid paper is the
exemplary modernist art object, but if that's the case Goldsmith is
onto it while Johnson isn't. I can see, like Jonathan, the point of
recontextualising language in the way KG does - there's nothing in
KJ's act that recontextualises the language, except the fact that he's
put his name on it, when authorship was never that important in the
first place. In other words, the supposedly radical transformation is
not radical at all, it just shifts the language from literature to
more literature, and it merely operates at the level of a punchline.
Ok, the subsequent (non)fuss points to the mechanisms by which books
get known in the consumerist politcs of exchange etc, but really,
yawn. In theorising "theft as an artistic act" - which as several
people have said isn't precisely groundbreaking - I think it's
seriously more interesting to look at Madoff. Or maybe that young guy
who stole Damien Hirst's pencil, who _is_ being sued (and who I think
is much funnier and is making a much more interesting point). And here
you are talking about the "innovation" of a book you frankly confess
you haven't read, which is wholly reductio ad absurdum. I mean, it's a
fake storm in an egg-cup.

The only reason that I can imagine Johnson's act resulting in some
kind of legal action, would be if the copies of the Figures edition of
Day were stolen. & that doesn't seem to be the case.

My reading of this is that it has to be just about the safest "brave"
action that anyone could make. Regardless of what Goldsmith may think
of Johnson and this act, I think he's smart enough to understand any
of the aesthetic & PR ramifications of Johnson's action and would be
very, VERY unlikely to bother to sue. The Figures is getting whatever
their wholesale price to Amazon is, so they have no reason to sue
either.

This isn't about someone claiming to make an original one of a kind
object that's an exact copy of another original one of a kind object.
It's about someone buying a book, apparently at retail price (so
Goldsmith and the Figures are getting paid already), and charging more
for it with some added stickers.

In the software business, this is called "added value."

If there are ten people out there who want to spend $7 extra for some
stickers, a signature and an aesthetic concept, that's great. But that
doesn't seem too much different to me than the fact that there are
people who were willing to spend $22 extra for the book without the
stickers and a slightly different aesthetic concept. Because ANY of
these people could have originally bought the NYTimes for that day for
a buck or less, & they could still get a copy of it from the NYTimes
for less than the price of the Figures book.

This isn't Robert Rauschenberg erasing a real drawing by Willem de
Kooning and exhibiting the erased paper as his own work. It's not
Kathy Acker getting sued by Arthur Hailey for using large chunks of
his novels in her own work. It's not John Oswald reconfiguring music
by the Beatles, Michael Jackson, etc and being forced to destroy all
the undistributed copies of the recordings. It's not Todd Haynes being
forced to stop exhibiting and distributing Superstar for it's use of
music by the Carpenters.

If Johnson wants to make a brave gesture concerning authorship and
copyright, let him try to sell copies of books by Dan Brown or
Patricia Cornwall as his own work.

This is about one relatively esoteric artist trying to make some noise
while pulling the chain of another relatively esoteric artist. Sure,
Goldsmith has some more visibility that Johnson, but neither of these
guys have any visibility in the mass culture we live in the midst of.
We're talking about artists that may be known to a couple of thousand
people in a world with a population of 6 billion.

About a dozen people have posted about this on the poetics list and
almost all of these posts seem to be trying to make it seem like
Johnson's made some kind of aesthetic coup. I don't see how you can
read it like that, and I think the lack of pushback that Johnson's
partisans have found here is a sign that I'm not the only one sees
this issue that way.

Chinese Whispers at Myopic Books

Sunday, October 4, 2009 (7-9 p.m.)



You are invited to attend "Chinese Whispers," which features a "poetry and
art by telephone" game with poetry. This event is part of the poetry series
curated by Larry Sawyer, and it is part of the Fourth Annual Chicago Calling
Arts Festival.



This event will be in homage -- in part -- to the "Art by Telephone" event
which happened at Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Art in 1969. (And that
event 40 years ago was inspired by Bauhaus artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy.)
"Chinese Whispers" might include directions which involve chance operations,
surrealist games, Oulipo strategies, and other elements. Out-of-town
directions will be coming from Lisa Hemminger (San Diego), Jesse Seldess
(Berlin), Billie Maciunas, Christopher Welch (Washington, DC), David
Harrison Horton (Beijing), Mathew Timmons (Los Angeles), and Eric Lietz
(Oakland). Chicago poets will include Jamie Kazay, Larry Sawyer, Jennifer
Karmin, Dan Godston, and Kevin Kilroy. After "Chinese Whispers" is over,
examples of the collaborations will be posted on a TBD website.



This event is free and open to the public.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

dandelion magazine is taking submissions for issue 35 number 2, "the sexual
politics of meat." The theme of this issue is inspired by Carol J. Adam=92s
theory of =93the sexual politics of meat=94 in her provocative book the of =
the
same title (published in 1990).

In this issue, we are looking for works that sketch, hypothesize, challenge=
,
elaborate, query, and otherwise address unexpected juxtapositions between
the human and the animal and amongst sex, politics, and meat. What, we
invite you to consider, are the historic, gender, race, and class
implications of meat culture? How has the consumption of meat shaped our
contemporary human cultures? How, by extension, has the consumption of meat
shaped our notions of what it means to be humans? &, as a consequence, what
it means to be men & women? How does the language of meat bleed into the
vocabulary of gender, & vice versa?

We are particularly interested in what innovative thinkers, writers, &
artists have to say about the relatings (or lack thereof) amongst sex,
politics, and meat. How, by pushing language to increasingly expressive
limits, can innovative texts intervene in the discourse of gender and food?
How can innovative literatures articulate an alternative to meat culture as
portrayed in the mass media?

*dandelion* publishes both critical and creative work and has, historically=
,
been interested in writing that challenges (or otherwise ignores) generic
expectations. It is the oldest literary magazine in Western Canada and is
dedicated to publishing a diverse selection of writing by established and
emerging writers from Canada and abroad.

Submission deadline is Dec 1st, 2009. The issue is slated to be published i=
n
late February 2010.

Email submissions are preferable, as a single attachment, with your last
name and =93sexual politics of meat=94 in the subject line, to

In response to Murat, yes, I have read DAY, although I read it some time
ago. DAY is not a masterpiece. But there are some stunning and exciting
poetic effects, most of which result from effective juxtaposition and
disjunction that results when ad-texts or other types of text (pull-quotes,
headlines, "garbage" like headers) interrupt news stories, and in some cases
the news items attain a certain pathos or silliness as a result of their
placement in a book rather than a newspaper, as the medium lays additional
emphasis on certain things. Of course, I find it conceptually interesting as
well.

In response to Jeffrey, it seem to me that defamiliarizing language is one
of the basic components of poetry itself. Estranging language from its
normal functions for heightened, poetic effect. Insofar as the
"conceptualising of theft as an artistic act," I suppose my response is
"yes, but who cares"? So what? Theft is conceptualized as an artistic act
constantly. Any found poem conceptualizes theft as an artistic act, to a
lesser degree obviously, and in this example the theft is very bold and
(insofar as the insular poetry world is concerned) high-profile, but so
what? I don't see why anyone should care.

Perhaps this does come down to a matter of taste, as you suggest. Insofar as
the conceptual underpinnings of each work, I find Goldsmith's act
interesting insofar as it works to defamiliarize language, imply commentary
on the print medium and on the news media, declare uncreative appropriation
and textual reframing as poetic to an absurd degree, and trouble questions
of authorship. Johnson's act seems, by comparison, to extend certain of
Goldsmith's concerns (theft, questions of authorship) for the sake of
satire, and so I don't see what is to be considered radical here.

It seems to me that this debate has become more about the personalities of
the authors involved and whether or not somebody likes one or dislikes the
other. I have absolutely no interest in this kind of discussion, and unless
the tide turns I intend this as my last word on the subject.

True enough, except that there's much to be said for,  and has been said of=
, shifting language from literature to more literature. To start with
what is of interest in a comparison of Johnson's appropriation with Goldsmi=
th's appropriation, relies less on the matter of 'originality' than on the =

Jeffrey, to be perfectly honest what's mostly getting up my nose is
the smartarse complacency of the publicity, which is, I guess, the
point of the whole exercise. You can't measure artistic courage by
suability, or every tabloid journo would be Pound. Mind you,
Enzensberger did say once that the contemporary tabloid paper is the
exemplary modernist art object, but if that's the case Goldsmith is
onto it while Johnson isn't. I can see, like Jonathan, the point of
recontextualising language in the way KG does - there's nothing in
KJ's act that recontextualises the language, except the fact that he's
put his name on it, when authorship was never that important in the
first place. In other words, the supposedly radical transformation is
not radical at all, it just shifts the language from literature to
more literature, and it merely operates at the level of a punchline.
Ok, the subsequent (non)fuss points to the mechanisms by which books
get known in the consumerist politcs of exchange etc, but really,
yawn. In theorising "theft as an artistic act" - which as several
people have said isn't precisely groundbreaking - I think it's
seriously more interesting to look at Madoff. Or maybe that young guy
who stole Damien Hirst's pencil, who _is_ being sued (and who I think
is much funnier and is making a much more interesting point). And here
you are talking about the "innovation" of a book you frankly confess
you haven't read, which is wholly reductio ad absurdum. I mean, it's a
fake storm in an egg-cup.

I read Johnson's Day as saying that Goldsmith's Day is full of shit.
Which may just be my own bias showing, but also is something that I
think is hilarious. Still, I think the Arsonism anthology was better
than either version of Day, and while I've not read any of them, I'm
more than willing to concede that my bias towards Issue 1 is a result
of my having been in it. Whereas I think it's disingenuous to ever
claim that Day was all that special or attributable to anyone since
Johnson via Goldsmith let James Joyce and Jackson Mac Low
inadvertently pick the date of his Day.

 2) to provide clear and specific contest guidelines defining conflict of i=

ically. We have adopted this Code to reinforce our integrity and dedication=
 as a publishing community and to ensure that our contests contribute to a =
vibrant literary heritage."

So is this event going to address the relationship between the term "Chinese
Whispers" and the racist notion that Chinese speech is all just a jumble of

If I didn't care much about anything (time, quality of consciousness,
engagement of value, etc.) except getting my name dribbled about, I'd write
an epic titled _Daze_ by retyping, in turn, Goldsmith and Johnson.

As it is . . .

Jeffrey Side wrote, kindly offering to send in a response by me to recent posts here. It would be easier to post directly, of course, but that doesn't seem to be possible.

Just to say I'm a bit bemused by the many earnest comments (at Poetics, at the other two major poetry lists, and at the initial first announcement of the wok here [I just noticed the typo, I'll keep it] http://www.digitalemunction.com/2009/09/22/advertisement-kent-johnsonsday/#comments)
that dismiss my new book as "trivial" in nature, as a "tempest in a teapot," as a gesture devoid of "risk,"  and so on. You have to admit: For a "publication" so trifling, the book sure seems to be generating a lot of indignation!

The thing is, these comments on the work's triviality are quite correct and obviously so. And I am sort of disappointed that part of its conceptual point seems to have been missed by so many. Alison Croggon's "yawn," for example, is perfectly poignant, inasmuch as she seems unawares that the Goldsmith wing of "Conceptualism" feverishly advocates Boredom as a poetic principle! So why my book would be dismissed because it out-bores KG's is beyond me. The muse that paid me a visit, you see, *instructed me* to be boring and to really go all the way, not just halfway, as with the case of KG's dime a dozen neo-readymade move. My Day aims to be, precisely, a dialectical advance in the concept of boredom. Which doesn't mean it's original (well, OK, maybe it is a little bit), or risky, or worth the paper it's not even written on.

I hope that helps clarify things.

Still, it's pleasing to see there are as many poets expressing enthusiasms about my book as there are those in a snit about it. Today, for example, Charles Zito posted the following comment at Digital Emunction, and I share it, eager that the many of you who are avant-garde academics will use it as he plans to use it. Perhaps after the full-page ad comes out next month, in a publication widely available at your local chain bookstore, more of you will? I hope so, as sales of the book (of which there already have been an unexpected few!) will help the continuing work of BlazeVOX, to which fabulous press I am donating all royalties. Anyway, here's what Charles Zito wrote:

>After watching a video on Kenny G, I wondered how far this conceptualism, with its lack of concern for originality or copyrights, could go. That it has resulted in this "reproduction" is truly entertaining. I just wanted to let you know that, as a result, your accomplishment will be discussed in my graduate poetry workshop. Thought you might enjoy that knowledge.<

Further, just as an informational note (and I promise I am not making this up), I have heard in the past couple days that there are tentative plans in the UK for the publication of a _Day Variorum_, both texts, KG's and KJ's, in one volume, set in parallel columns for ease of comparison. Hopefully, some of the hefty copies will be adopted in future seminars at those new citadels of Conceptualism, U. of Penn and Princeton.

best,

Kent

Hi Wystan. I can't believe how my fingers itch reading this stuff, the
way it makes you want to open your mouth and comment, although you
know it would be better not to. And then you regret it. And here I am
again.  I guess in that way Kent's action is a hugely successful
provocation.

I was never exercised with its "originality". It's a complacent action
because it has all the answers in advance, and any criticism is
instantly self-cancelling. I think that's deadly. It's boring because
all it is about is literary politics, all that strategic acuteness you
mention, as if there isn't a world out there (yes, I am perfectly
aware of Kent's background and involvement, and am grateful to him for
introducing me to contemporary Russian poetry - I know he can do more
interesting things). It presents itself a risk - or at least Jeffrey
is presenting it as risk, to be fair I'm not sure Kent is - when it
involves no risk at all (it would have been much more risky, and maybe
if the question of contemporary authorship was the issue would have
had more point, as someone else said, to plagiarise Dan Brown). As if
Goldsmith is going to bother to sue.  I do think the fact that the
book is simply a matter of putting stickers over KG's name is funny,
because - as I said in some comment earlier - it's a better joke if
the book doesn't exist at all, and it clearly doesn't. But it takes
about two minutes to get the punchline, and then I find myself here,
being part of the performance, so that Jeffrey can go "aha! you see?
what an interesting literary controversy!"

Jeffrey, of course KG "recontextualises" the language in DAY, whether
he says he does or not.  He takes the text of the NYT and puts it
between the covers of a book. If that's not recontextualising I don't
know what is. And of course that "defamiliarises" it. I've seen
Goldsmith perform his found texts (is this what is meant by "not
reading" them?) and it's far from boring, whatever his own intentions
- more a sudden levitation of the mundane and unheard into vivid life.
I guess this is also a performance of sorts, but really, what for? It
assumes a whole lot of things about literature and then goes out to
prove them, like bad science. And here I am helping it along. Mouth
zipping up now.

Aloha Tinfish friends--

I am writing to announce publication of our 19th issue of the annual journal, which is beautifully designed, covered by hand-made stuffs, and full of wonderful work.  Please support our efforts to publish experimental poetry from the Pacific.

_Tinfish 19_ includes parodies of Wallace Stevens by Jill Yamasawa and Gizelle Gajelonia; a letter to the editor in
verse by Ryan Oishi; poems from Daniel Tiffany's forthcoming Tinfish volume, _Dandelion Clock_; landlord poems
by Oscar Bermeo and Deborah Woodard; interventions in Maoist indigestion by Kenny Tanemura and Guantanamo by
Rachel Loden; as well as poems by such luminaries as Barbara Jane Reyes, Jody Arthur, Jennifer Reimer, Janna Plant,
Brandon Shimoda, Mandy Luo, Dennis Phillips, Emelihter Kihleng, Paul Naylor and others.  Graphic design by Chae Ho Lee,
covers and centerfold by Maya Portner, editorial assistance from Jade Sunouchi, art direction from Gaye Chan, and
editorial diligence by Susan M. Schultz.  The covers were handmade, the books handbound.  $10.

We are charging $12 through http://www.facebook.com/l/5f651;2checkout.com (go to http://www.facebook.com/l/5f651;tinfishpress.com, click on "purchase," go to the bottom of the 2checkout page and order that way) because we no longer get our postage from UH.

Subject:      Tarpaulin Sky Press Open for Submissions of Full-Length
              Manuscripts
MIME-Version: 1.0

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Dear Friends and Readers,

During the month of October, Tarpaulin Sky Press will be reading full-length
manuscripts of poetry, fiction, and cross-genre work. Manuscripts should be
postmarked between October 1 and October 31, 2009. There is no need to query
first; simply mail the manuscript according to the directions below.

Please send one copy of your manuscript along with two copies of the title
page (note: the reading process is not "blind"--we ask for two title pages
only so that we may keep one with the manuscript, and the other for
reference/notes, etc). Be sure that your title pages include your name,
address, telephone number, and email address.

Cover letters are read with interest. We like to know who your are, what
you're up to, and where we can read more of your work.

We do accept simultaneous submissions but ask that you let us know
immediately if your manuscript is accepted elsewhere. Individual pieces from
the manuscript may have been previously published in magazines, anthologies,
and short-run chapbooks, but the collection as a whole must be unpublished.
Manuscripts will not be returned. Please do not send us your only copy.

Writers who have not been published in our literary journal should include a
$20 reading fee in the form of a check or a money order made payable to
Tarpaulin Sky Press. Past contributors to Tarpaulin Sky may submit their
manuscript with a $10 reading fee. Current subscribers to Tarpaulin Sky
Press do not need to include a reading fee (you've already done plenty to
support the press--thank you). Everyone submitting a manuscript is welcome
also to choose from any TSky Press trade paperback (sorry, no
chapbooks)--just let us know which title you would like, and enclose with
your submission packet a 9x12, self-addressed, stamped envelope with $2.64
in postage. We will ship the books separately from your notification SASE.

Mail your submission to

Tarpaulin Sky Press
PO Box 189
Grafton, VT 05146

For notification of decisions, include a business-size SASE. If you would
like to receive acknowledgment of the receipt of your manuscript, please
include a stamped, self-addressed postcard. Notification of decisions will
be made in February 2010. Publication of accepted manuscripts will be in
2010 & 2011.

I met my husband Tony,  a poet, when I was hosting Listen & Be Heard =20
Open Mic in Vallejo, CA.  He appeared to be trying not to be noticed, =20=

but after creating a sensation on the mic, he stood out in the crowd. =20=

I tried to act like he wasn=92t going to rock my world, but he did =20
anyway. After that fated meeting we published Listen & Be Heard =20
Weekly together and opened Listen & Be Heard Poetry Cafe in downtown =20
Vallejo. After five years we closed up shop, and continue only with =20
the online Arts News and Poetry publications. We felt like we had =20
done everything we could do where we were,  and I followed him with =20
our three boys to his hometown, Greenville, SC.

He always told me that Greenville was a beautiful and unique city and =20=

he was going to move me there one day. And I=92m glad he did! =20
Greenville is indeed a rare gem, and in the five months that I have =20
been living here, I=92ve seen many signs of a flourishing arts =
community.

On Saturday December 12, at 7:30pm we will make our arrival official =20
with a poetic performance in the theatre at the Coffee Underground in =20=

downtown Greenville. We have distinctive styles, quite different from =20=

each other. Both improvisational fun and the culmination of decades =20
of spoken word performance between the two of us, what happens when =20
we come together is synergistic and transformative.

We look forward to sharing the excitement with friends, family and =20
poetry lovers in Greenville. The Coffee Underground serves dinner and =20=

desserts and of course espresso drinks, coffee and tea. Seating is =20
limited to fifty. Advance purchase of tickets is recommended, and =20
will be available at the counter, at the Coffee Underground.

Of course, as usual, the real radicals working in this vein are neither from
the West nor from the overdeveloped world. I who have had the tremendous
privilege of seeing, holding, and reading the work of these artists do not
even know their names, though I can tell you where to find their work.

In the bookstores in the tourist areas of Phnom Penh or Sihanoukville, you
will see what appear to be standard reproductions of various English
language texts including, perhaps most strikingly of all, those translated
from other tongues, including Japanese. Open these books, however, and you
will find something entirely different: an appropriation through the
mechanism of the photocopier. This is a powerful reverse colonization of the
word and a rejection of notions of intellectual ownership that have served
to reify Western dominance and capitalistic exploitation. It is, too, a
method of deploying modern Western technology and words (thus ideas) against
modern Western ideas.

Most radically of all, the artists decline to add their names to the books
they have thus appropriated which presents a challenge not only to concepts
of authorship and intellectual property but to identity itself. It also
reflects a thorough understanding of the Death of the Author (and, given
Cambodia's history, one suspects of real death as well).

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=windows-1252
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Many thanks to Christopher Leland Winks for writing of Debord & Lautreamont=
.

It is not so much that so called american conceptual poetry mentions,
slighly misquoting Brion Gysin, that writing is decdes behind painting, but
that american poetry itself is often about 100-150 years behind that in
other countries. Not unexpectedly, once seizing on some of these ideas and
diluting, deforming, omitting areas, to create a sanitized "homeland
security" american version of them,  the ideas then should turn out to be
reactionary rebrandings.  "Boredom is always, always,
counter-revolutionary," writes Ducasse/Lautremont in Poesies. Before him,
Baudelaire wrote of "acedie, la maladie des moines," (acedia, the illness o=
f
monks), which implies besides boredom a kind of mental masturbation.

The main goal of much of the discussion, as it  itself demonstrates on cue,
is that the current rebranded remakes of revisionary versions of old
stereotypes and clichesof modern art and poetry is to generate not ideas bu=
t
WORDS.  Publish or perish! As Murat has pointed out, plagiarism can get one
in trouble; while copying the newspaper etc doesn't.  hence what better way
to write safely in an academic and "understanding" setting pieces which are
simply copies of safe and innocuous documents--and at the same time get
credit and generate yet more copies of copies and commentaries which are
copies of commentaries.  Soon the filing and data mining sections of the
Dept are being devoted to the moving about and classifying of an endless
production of copies of copies . . . each one though may be thought of as
slightly "different and interesting" if one changes the author's name and s=
o
in the familiar lexicon, "defamiliarizes, reframes and recontextualizes" th=
e
samo samo.

The speed with which so called american conceptual poetry is marched right
through the door into the classroom is part of its "usefulness," that is, i=
t
generates WORDS--as one of the principle anxieties of poetry and poetics in
the academic/maintream is the necessity for producing "language" at al
costs, and preferably at a low cost for a high yield return, which copying
huge chunks of words does wonderfully..

In the  Borges story of Pierre Menard, Menard,an obscure French  belle
lettriste, manages to write his own verison, with Herculaean labors, of a
few chapters and fragementsof Don Quixote.  Incredibly, his version, writte=
n
inthe early 20th century, is word for word the same as Cervantes' text.
Yet, as the narrator, demonstartes, becuase the words are written, generate=
d
from within Menard, and in a different time and place, the seemingly
identical text takes on now a much richer and more profound meaning than th=
e
original.  The difference between menard and say "Day" (or maybe "groundhog
Dagy"--) is that Menard uses a consciously literary text, while today's
example under discussion uses that holy of Holies, the New York Times.
(Which, a great many of its writers would take note of--is also aliterary
text in at least their articles--)

Paul Celan wrote that "poetry no longer imposes itself, it exposes itself."
In the "day' forumaltion, "poetry" is imposed on the "non-poetic" as a way
to lay claim to a new territory a new source for the insatiable demand for
material--i.e. words

Menard's version of Cervantes is a work that "exposes"  a different text
which is existing in the text as it is, one that takes place within the
timme period of William James et alia, making the meaning of phrases shift
quite drastically, though the wrods are the same.

William Carlos Williams in stating that "a poem can be made of anything,"
made use of a menu; next on the agenda should be perhaps the Encyclopedia
Britannica or the MacMillan Encyclopedia of baseball, with the statistics o=
f
every player who ever appeared in a Major league uniform, even if, like
"Moonlight" Graham, they haver batted or played the field but simply waited
on deck.

Ancient documents show that originally the writer, as scribe, was a copyist
of the words and numbers read off or spoken by others. The scribe was
"instrumental" in the conducting of commerce and diplomacy, of keeping
records and and deatiling prophecies  As a useful member of the ruling
class's servant groups, the scribe was entrusted with many "trade secrets"
at times, making room for treachery if one was so tempted.  ( I.E.--"sellin=
g
out"--)

In uneasy times such as the present, when security and surveillance are
daily more intensely imposed on every individual, what could be a better wa=
y
of writing than to become a scribe, a copyist, and so ensure oneself a
steady position in the realm of the ruling class?

Bartleby, the copyist who said, "I prefer not to," and Flaubert's Bouvard
and Pecuchet who , after essaying to learn about everything and fail and
then decide to begin copying again, seem less like doomed souls than
examples of what kind of stupidity (in Flaubert's view) it takes to refuse
to be a copyist.

In the Renaissance, when the figure of the ARTIST in capital letters began
to be developed as a being with Star Power and Romantic Madness etc, it was
not uncommon to find wealthy households in which there were hanging
amazingly exact copies of famous originals  which themselves were in the
hands of even wealthier and more powerful patrons.

The owners of the copies were satisfied, because it was not simply that the=
y
possessed a copy of a great work, like a machine made print of today, but
that their copy was an "original" by so and so a well known expert at
copying others' works for the benefit of his clients.

Thus in the era which first really sent into orbit the idea of the Great
genius Artist, one finds also the example of the highly skilled and
respected craftsperson who can turn out a good and "original" copy.Of
Course, in the Renaissance, many things were respected that today would
horrify--

But then, the idea of a copy by a good copyist as a suitable ornament for
any respectable home was something of VALUE and a demonstration of the tast=
e
of the owners.
. . .
Perhaps "conceptual poets" can be able to find this sort of employment--and
so escape the Curse of Saturn bestoewed upon those called Original.

before this discussion had started i was working on a piece of which these
are excerpts which related to what Christopher Winks writes of--

. Lautreamont writes of using plagiarized material only if one develops it,
and the *Poesies* is filled with examples from Pascal esp and a few other
writers, in whcih Lautreamont has changed in some cases just one word, whic=
h
does indeed greatly develop in new openings of possibilities the plagiarize=
d
quotation.  In a way, this method of development is not unlike the
"detournement" of the Situationists, in which some banality is turned into =
a
kind of slogan turned against the original clich=E9 ridden banalities it is
confronting and deforming . . .


Yet there is also the poet's work against the banality the clich=E9, the
stereotype, in which the journey is taken ever further into the core of
language--such as Isou's "the word is the stereotype" forcing him to go
further afield and delve into the letter itself as the field for poetic
action and imagination.  Isou's idea of a chiseling phase having reached it=
s
apogee in the letter of Lettrisme enables him to use it also as a fulcrum
for beginning the new word of the Amplic phases, in which Lettrisme must
deconstruct everything and replace it with its Lettriste version and so
start anew working for a Utopian society.  (In the background is the letter
work of Schwitters and also the half joke of Rimbaud=92s "Voyelles" with th=
e
color coded vowels used to start all sorts of hallucinatory speculations
among the young followers of the missing [vanishing, disappearing, no longe=
r
poet] poet, leading to Des Esseintes' (in Huysmans=92s *A Rebours*)  making
various forms of colors-sounds associations in the way the Japanese do with
scent associations, so that a color is played like a note, a letter--the
idea of a kind of organ on which one sounds a note and its equivalent in
colors appears--like a kind of minimalist jukebox! Which idea is actually
found in the minimalist works in a way of Steve Reich and the early Phillip
Glass.)


Isidore Isou, quite early in his career as founder & center of the Universe
of Lettrisme,-- Isidore Isou,  formulator of a species of Gesamtkunstwerk i=
n
which all the arts and media are reformulated-- though in a manner less
militant & much less obsessed with mechanical speeds  than the same project
previously remodeled/remodulated by the hands of the Italian Futurists=97 t=
his
God Isidore  Isou  propounded a new form of Historical Development of
Poetics, based on the alternating periods of the two yin/yang currents of
the "Amplic" and "Chiseling."

(Isou claimed=97and could prove--that his theoretical method dated to his
early adolescence, before his arrival in post- Liberation Paris from his
native Romania. His first published works in French on the subject appeared
in 1947, from the prestigious Gallimard Press, though many others, such as
the one quoted here, are dated as early as 1942, and were written while the
poet was still living in his =93country of birth. =93)



Larry Wendt in *=93The Genealogy of narrative=92=92* gives one a very good =
&
concise introduction to these two Isousien tendencies, the Amplic and the
Chiseling:

In his attempt to rewrite all of human knowledge, Isou had discovered that
the evolution of any art was characterized by two phases: 'amplic' and
'chiseling.' In following the development of the art of poetry for example,
Isou saw the Lettrist at the end of a long chiseling phase which had begun
with Baudelaire reducing narrative in his poetry to anecdote, then Rimbaud
disregarding anecdote for lines and words, Mallarm=E9 reducing words to sou=
nd
and spaces (particularly in *Un Coup de Des*), and finally the Dadaists
destroyed the word altogether. Isou saw at the end of this phase the new
beginnings of an amplic stage for culture, from which a whole host of new
arts, ways of working, and social institutions would eventually spring, wit=
h
Isou at the center of all creative work.

The Lettrist worked on the level of the letter at the heart of what they
believed to be an experiential language that was to be the basis of their
new culture. Their *Lexique Des Lettres Nouvelles, *for example was a sonic
alphabet of a 130 or so sounds from which a new natural language was to
spring from and from which they composed their poetry.

(Larry Wendt, *The Geneolgy of narrative)*

* *

* **     *=93*It=92s not about notes, it=92s about feelings,=94 *Ornette
Coleman famously stated regarding Free Jazz.  Isou continually
emphasizes feelings in opposition to words.  For Isou, writing in
*MANIFESTO OF LETTERIST POETRY A) Commonplaces about Words:*

 =93The word is the first stereotype,=94 but =93All impulses escape stereot=
yping.=94


For Isou, the stereotype goes back to those =93Notions . . . [from] . . .  =
an
inherited dictionary,=94 recalling Flaubert=92s *Dictionairre des idees rec=
ues
(Dictionary of received ideas), *itself a compendium of the inanities which=
,
since they are unquestioningly accepted, makes them appear to be =93real=94
ideas, forms, persons, events, knowledge, whose sheer accumulation  create
Isou=92s concept of the =93rigidity of forms [that] impedes their [our
fluctuations] transmission.=94

 For, verily,  are not stereotypes the very embodiment of the =93rigidity o=
f
forms,=94 which create that false sense of their being eternal verities in
=93Naming the Unknown by the Forever,=94 in contradistinction to Baudelaire=
=92s
concept of modernism as the conjunction of the ephemeral and the Eternal,
that which is eternal within the ephemeral, and that ephemerality existing
within the appearance of the Eternal?

This reactionary, anti-modernist tactic , recognized by Baudelaire, Flauber=
t
and Isou, is the use of Naming to be a Forever  which excludes the Unknown,
producing the stereotype of the word, an impediment to transmission by its
stoppage of feelings and thoughts,  by its =93brutality of words=94 which a=
re
those =93Discharges transmitted by notions.=94

=93Discharges transmitted by notions!=94  What a great phrase, what an imag=
e!
The ultimate weapon whose use stops just this side of violence turns out to
be the stereotype transmitted by =93notions=92 which have al the horrible
solidity of  the =93Biggest Lies=94 of advertisements, propaganda, discours=
es of
institutions, =93stamps of authenticity and approval,=94 while at the same =
time
retaining a reassuring vagueness whose very fuzziness causes the mind to
settle dreamily into it as into a nice fat feather bed. (See Jim Thompson=
=92s
The Killer Inside Me for the Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford=92s use of the clich=
=E9 as
a way of refraining from =93the real way=94 of killing rather than simply
=93boring to death=94 his victims).



Isou's Amplic phase is interesting to contrast with the Amplic of some of
today's American conceptions of production in the poetries of Flarf and
Conceptualism a la Kenny G. IN the latter, for example, one finds what
Bartleby said "I prefer not to" to--copying, rather than plagiarism with a
development, moving of files, data, the poet as office drone aestheticizing
the means of production for the pleasure of the observing CEO's or "high
paying high art customers."  A kind of useless Amplic mad production is
churning away while being observed by the owners of the means of production=
,
for whom the poet in a sense has become again a dependent worker, not even =
a
craftsman, but simply an invisible drone.

When I was like ten or so, I would just walk through the fiction section in
my local public library, close my eyes, reach my hand out, pick a book
blindly, and read it very fast.  (Now I think I am the slowest reader I
know.)  Anyways, once I did this and read a very powerful novel about
climate change, and I have googled zealously on occasion trying to remember
its title and author, to no avail.

There is this protagonist who, by the end of the first section, has written
a book called something like "One Minute to Midnight" or "6 Minutes to
Midnight," about how the oceans are about to reach their CO2 saturation
point, after which there will be massive, rapid climate change.  (This book
must have been written, at earliest, in the mid '80's I think.)  There are
special interests trying to stop him from publishing.  Some chase scene in
an airport near the end of this section, escalators and washrooms and
syringes and such.  Something about being on an airplane, worrying about the
CO2 being released by one's fizzy drink.

At the beginning of the second section, his book has managed to appear, and
the climate change has begun.  In e.g. Florida, and all tropical places, it
is difficult to breathe, the air is bad.  Something about driving a car
around Florida.  Then there are these evil groups trying to secure power in
the radically changed place the world's becoming.  They develop a virus to
wipe out massive populations in Africa (and Asia?) - the virus is somehow
developed from a toxin.  There is a group trying to make potable water from
sea water, but they cannot because the toxin has contaminated the oceans.
 This evil group is also kidnapping human mutants and experimenting on them,
and developing a new species called "the Meek" with smaller brains and
bigger lungs who will live on.  Something about the head bad guy eventually
being devoured by the mutants.  Something about the protagonist having sex
on a couch.

In a later section, the air everywhere is very bad, and there are groups of
people who live in underground structures.  There is a species of dwarf-like
creatures called the Homunculi, or "Uncles" for short.  Something about this
underground structure eventually being overwhelmed by the Uncles, and our
heroes must flee.  They have heard rumors of concentration camps.

But they discover that these are not death camps but life camps.  They make
it to one.  The fences are to keep creatures out, not people in.  Eventually
the surviving members of the human race are living in a space station(s).
 The station has a perfectly efficient self-contained ecosystem: people,
plants, food, waste, air, water, etc., fully conserved, and life goes on.
 Something about a glassed-off area containing 100% humidity air, in which
zero gravity fish can fly this way and that.  From space, Earth appears
brown.

Any of this ringing some rusty bells?  I'm a nostalgic soul (Puccini makes
me weep even while boring me), and'd love to know what I was reading.

"Francesco Levato's powerful documentary, 'War Rug' -- like Eliot
Weinberger's What I heard about Iraq before it -- detains the language of
the perpetrators of global military aggression and redeploys it to indict
them. From J.C. Penny catalog copy to counterintelligence manuals and
autopsy reports, War Rug is a fierce yet unfortunate reminder of the
absolute horrors of our age." -- Mark Nowak, author of Coal Mountain
Elementary

"War Rug" is a work of documentary poetics in the form of a book length
poem. Multiple interwoven narratives explore life within zones of conflict
as viewed through the lens of current warfare. The narratives range from
passages inspired by journal entries, firsthand accounts, and news reports
to poetic constructs collaged from military doctrine, Freedom of Information
Act released government documents (like CIA interrogation manuals, and
detainee autopsy reports), and numerous other sources.

This enhanced eBook contains the author's notebook with hyperlinks to access
additional content such as books, web sites, audio, and video that inspired
and informed the author's creative process. It is distributed in Portable
Document Format (PDF) and is viewable and printable on virtually any
platform -- Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, UNIX, and many mobile platforms,
including the Apple iPhone.

If the 836-pp. Day established Kenny
Goldsmith as without a doubt the
leading conceptual poet of his time, the 836-pp. Day by Kent Johnson may
well be remembered for nudging the politics of Conceptual Poetry out of
blithely affirmative, institutional framings, and into truly negational,
critical spaces.


=8BJuliana Spahr
=20
Recent trends in technologies of communication have already begun to subver=
t
the romantic bastions of "creativity" and "authorship," calling into
question the propriety of copyright through strategies of plagiaristic
appropriation=8A Such developments have caused poets to theorize an innovativ=
e
aesthetics of "conceptual literature" that has begun to question, if not to
abandon, the lyrical mandate of originality in order to explore the
potentials of the "uncreative," be it automatic, mannerist, aleatoric, or
readymade, in its literary practice=8A Such activity (employing self and
ego-effacing tactics via uncreativity, unoriginality, appropriation,
plagiarism, fraud, theft, and falsification as its precepts) has become one
of the most radical, if not one of the most popular, limit-cases of the
avant-garde at the advent of the millennium. With Day, Kent Johnson claims
his place as one of the major figures of this new writing, showing, in
single move, how Conceptual Poetry has been nearly forty years behind the
politics of Institutional Critique.
=8BChristian B=F6k
=20
As he once asked, at the blog of the Poetry Foundation (though with what
seems in retrospect a disingenuous banality), =B3Nearly one hundred years
after Duchamp, why hasn=B9t appropriation become a valid, sustained[,] or eve=
n
tested literary practice?=B2 Here now, Kent Johnson wagers the query with a
vengeance, brazenly upping the ante of Uncreative dialectic by throwing dow=
n
before us a readymade gesture that is nothing but dizzying in the synthesis
of its conception: a flagrant appropriation of a Conceptual work=B9s
Authorship and Copyright, categories which themselves had been branded into
this same text, in flagrant appropriation by another K (yes, me), in first,
antithetical instance. Thus, here at Boring Ranch, in gamble with a gambol,
he claims all the cow chips, one could say, with the searing, asterisked
irony of a double-K smoking iron. His Day emerges hot and bright from the
dead-dark of an innocent pre-dawn, a sort of authentic Afterlife that rises
from the =B3original=B2 simulacral body in which it had lain (latent and
expectant). As in the best of Sherrie Levine, but more radically still, it
summons us, now, that we might think harder in its sudden light. Indeed,
Kent Johnson=B9s Day stands as the first Conceptual gesture of its kind in th=
e
history of American poetry: An open, literal theft of an entire =B3book,=B2
exhibited without shame, as a new and strange Work of Art in our Museum of
Modern Poetry. I can only tip my hat.

Attempt to halt the flow of time without the use of hallucinogens, then
examine and analyse your emotional responses when you realise that your
efforts are futile - also you'll realise, concurrently that it is far easier
to write a poem!

Kind (and  urgent) Greetings to All,

Now that we’re a week away from this major  event, a BIG-UP reminder
thereof:


Thursday, October 15, 2009 at Abrons Arts Center,  NYC
DAVID S. WARE
DARIUS JONES TRIO
WILLIAM PARKER & THE LITTLE  HUEY CREATIVE MUSIC ORCHESTRA


David S. Ware has been gearing up for this  performance the whole summer
and up to the present moment.  The one only  time I’ve every seen this
Master perform solo, it was a breathtaking  transporting ascent. Solo is
how DSW wanted to return to the stage following  his life being saved. We
are also very happy that Laura Mehr, who donated her  kidney to David in
May, will by flying up from Florida and will be in the  audience, hearing
David perform live for the first time.

Darius  Jones so belongs up in here, oh my god, this young man will be
bringing it!  Some new pieces will be premiered further to  selections
from his stunning debut album, Man’ish Boy.    Read this amazing just
posted review of Darius’ album (writer  got it!):
http://popdose.com/jazz-dont-hurt-the-blazing-fire-of-a-manish-boy/

William  Parker & The Little Huey Creative Music Orchestra will be making
their  first NYC appearance in over four years; their last show at Vision
Festival  2005 was one of the most illuminated, dancing, joy-inducing,
next level sets  at Vision Fest, ever!   They’ll be premiering a new
Parker  composition entitled, "Subsequent Illumination Inscriptions /
Light Cottage"  (for George Russell).

OK, the deal is this: AUM is renting the  Abrons Arts Center in order to
manifest this magnificent triple-bill; we need  to sell more tickets in
order to make the fee we promised to the musicians  (and not be in
serious debt this season).  So we exhort you to please buy  tix and be
there if you’re in the NYC metro (and beyond..?) and also spread  the
good word of this event to all available friends who are into
transformative live musical performance by some of the musical masters of
the  present era.   Deal?    Dynamite!   (See  full details below the
horizontal line to forward to friends with your own  pointed preface;
thanks!).

Advance Tickets Now Available: $20-  (plus $3.50 surcharge is true, but
still a little less than $25- at the  door!)
exclusively from Theatermania / OvationTix
online here <https://www.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/679665>
and by phone  212.352.3101  or   866.811.4111

Hah! But if the concept is all, why execute it? My basic point is to
disagree with Goldsmith (and Johnson, in other respects) and argue that the
works must also be judged insofar as their "performance" is concerned.

Here's what we'll be using Friday night, also good video - Alan

http://www.alansondheim.org/evamsl.mp4

again -


SECOND LIFE PERFORMANCE NIGHT AT EYEBEAM


WHERE:

EYEBEAM - 540 W 21st St. New York, NY 10011

Event Type:  performance
Start Date:  Oct 09, 2009
Hours:  6:30PM-8:30PM
Venue:  Eyebeam

Second Life Performance Night


This evening will feature three different artists/groups, which use the
online virtual world of Second Life as a medium for performance art.
Launched in 2003 by Linden Labs, Second Life (SL) hit widespread
popularity in 2006. In this 3D-rendered world, people across the world
share a networked space with unique avatars. With a completely
user-generated environment, SL enables a rich world of artistic
possibilities.

Alan Sondheim along with Foofwa d'Imobilite will present a performance
using the aesthetics of the Second Life environment to create an
experimental choreography; Lily & Honglei will present The Merry-go-around
a virtual installation addressing a series of environmental issues in
todays China; Second Front has discovered a virtual crypt within Second
Life and are inviting the public to witness its opening. Together, these
three short performances (12-15 minutes each) will sample some of the
contemporary trends in Second Life performance art.
The performances will be followed by a brief panel discussion and a
subsequent launch party of Avvie Road  the second DVD of Second Fronts
performance works.

People: Alan Sondheim (with Foofwa d'Imobilite), Lily & Honglei, Patrick
Lichty, Scott Kildall

Alison=2C I think your comment is pretty exact.

I would add my first thought upon hearing of this project: that Kent had to=
 become a "conceptual" poet in order to (critique? parody?) that moment.  A=
nd that this in some way cancels out his own critique or parody.  Ultimatel=
y=2C the critiques one could make of his project are pretty much the same a=
s one could make of Goldsmith's.  And I'm sure Kent is well aware of this.

Yet=2C exactly for this reason=2C Johnson's "conceptual" work doesn't fly f=
or me.  I agree that some=2C and indeed most of his work is more interestin=
g.  Johnson's Day has=2C though=2C I think=2C produced a more interesting c=
onversation on this list than we usually get these days.  For whatever that=
's worth.

Another thought: one problem with the term "conceptual poetry" is that it i=
mplies that other types of writing/poetry are lacking in ideas.  Of course =
this is true of some poetry=2C as it is true of some (most?) cinema and vis=
ual art.  Yet I think the term as a catch phrase misses/misreads a lot of o=
therwise interesting writing=2C while glorifying what I find to be less int=
eresting=2C frankly.  I guess=2C to make my biases clear=2C I've always pre=
ferred Pollock=2C Motherwell or Rauschenberg to Warhol=2C and Warhol most d=
efinitely to Koons.

One final question: Where is Kenny G in all this debate?  Surely he has som=
ething to add to this conversation.  Or does he only hang out at the Harrie=
t blog these days?

Cheers=2C

Announcing Ekleksographia Wave Two: The Translation Special:

http://ekleksographia.ahadadabooks.com/



or for the direct link:

http://ekleksographia.ahadadabooks.com/ballardini/index.html







I would like to thank *Jesse Glass* for having offered me the opportunity t=
o
call the following Poets and Artists interested in translation. A special
thank you to *Jonathan Penton* who assembled the files online, and to *Bert=
y
Skuber* for having forwarded her beautiful watercolor that I selected for
the front cover of the issue. My most felt acknowledgment goes to the Poets
=E2=80=93 Contributors of the present issue, without their hard work *Eklek=
sographia
Translation* would not have existed.

And to the Readers, for developing ad infinitum what translated through
their reading. If Poetry is the servant of Arts, Translation is the doormat
of the Luxurious Villa of All Arts, this time celebrated in its refined
Grandeur.

                          I am dedicating this issue to *Karl Young* for hi=
s
complete recovery.

Apologies for doing this, but I think I have read an interesting
discussion on appropriation and poetry on this list in which a post
claimed that painting is decades in advance of poetry.

I seem to have lost this discussion, so is there a way to revisit this
discussion, perhaps as an internet archive? I use to be a painter and
photographer working in the painting model of art and a few years after
giving up painting found myself a published poet, so I do have some bio
type interest to begin with (and along the lines of Douglas Crimp's
approach to art history.)

Please feel free to contact me at my email address if need be. Being in
and out of my studio and darkroom and reading the computer screen I seem
to find myself getting very confused. Let me know if this is the case.

With best wishes, Chris Jones. (PS, my kitten started playing on my
keyboard so this may also explain the missing discussions?)

Dear friends in the Twin Cities,

This weekend, Minneapolis welcomes the Twin Cities Book Festival =20
(October 10). And Christian B=F6k, author of Eunoia, will be among the =20=

festival's special guests.

Eunoia is a bestselling book of poetry that won the Griffin Poetry =20
Prize upon its publication. It is a five-chapter book in which each =20
chapter is a univocal lipogram. (Chapter A only uses the vowel 'A,' =20
Chapter E only uses 'E,' etc.) More recently, the book was just =20
released in the UK, where it became an overnight sensation -- selling =20=

out of its print run within a week, and appearing in the Times' top =20
ten books of 2008.

Christian will be at the Twin Cities Book Festival in support of the =20
new, upgraded edition of Eunoia. He's created artificial languages for =20=

science fiction TV programs (like Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final =20
Conflict), made books out of Lego bricks and his current project =20
involves injecting single-celled organisms with poems. (And no, I did =20=

not make that up.)

He's also an astounding reader. Here are a couple of YouTube clips of =20=

B=F6k's highly entertaining readings:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DfUNwHmQc9yk

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DalTdbe1GCnQ


The Twin Cities Book Festival
featuring Christian B=F6k, Nicholson Baker, Lorrie Moore, Gabrielle Bell =
=20
and more.
Saturday, October 10, 10 am to 5 pm
Minneapolis Community & Technical College, 1301 Hennepin Avenue S.
Minneapolis, MN
Free

We hope any of you in Minneapolis can make it to see Christian B=F6k =20
read in Minneapolis this weekend.



Best,

Evan

I'm unclear as how we are all accepting poetry being behind art by 50 years=
 as a truism. Dada=2C Futurism=2C Surrealism were all ushered in by writers=
. Jackson Mac Low produced the first Fluxus product. The poets who write th=
eory have advanced both poetry and art=2C in as much as art theorists have =
advanced poetry.=20

You've got Dan Godston in Chicago trying to make poetry more telematic (htt=
p://www.chicagocalling.org/) which is using the technology of the day=2C yo=
u've got the different lists built around collective authorship (where does=
 that happen in the market driven art industry?)=2C etc. . .=20

=20

The art industry is geared for making art for the rich (collectors=2C deale=
rs) who buy it as an investment and then later it gets sold to museums or t=
he museums buy early hoping to "capitalize" on their investments.   =20


Show me the collector/dealer/art gallery representative I can talk to? I de=

--------------------------------------------


June 2008: Refocussed List Policy
In line with our editorial focus, we do not automatically post
submissions but select those we think are most useful for sustaining
this online community. We appreciate all submissions, but will be more
selective in what we choose to post. Queries for contact info,
messages intended for just a few subscribers, messages that are not on
topic, "flame" messages, and free-standing personal poems or journal
entries will, in general, not be forwarded to the list.

1. Posting to the List

Our aim is to support, inform, and extend those directions in poetry
that are committed to innovations, renovations, and investigations of
form and/or/as content, to the questioning of received forms and
styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined, untried,
unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that other
lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that
those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and
focused nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a
moderated list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage
divergent points of view on innovative forms of modern and
contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to doing what is
necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

The Poetics List is a moderated list. Posts are limited to list
subscribers. All messages are reviewed by the editors in keeping with
the goals of the list as articulated in this Welcome Message. The
listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for discussion
and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow listserv
policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

Please note that this list is primarily concerned with discussions of
poetry and poetics. We strongly encourage subscribers to post
information, including web links, relating to publications (print and
internet), reading series, and blogs that they have coordinated,
edited or published, or in which they appear. Such announcements
constitute a core function of this list. Brief reviews of poetry
events and publications (print or digital) are always welcome.

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Queres for contact info, messages intended
for just a few subscribers, "flame" messages, and free-standing
personal poems or journal entries will, in general, not be forwarded
to the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of  very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers. Personal queries and off-topic submissions will not be
posted.

Send messages directly to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


2. About the Poetics List

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1500 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers).

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation.

In addition to being archived through the EPC and at the UB Listerv
archive, some posts to Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices,
announcements, etc.) may also become part of specific EPC subject
areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also online at the
EPC.

registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed from the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.

6. Cautions

In moderating this list, the editors must consider sometimes competing
interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with our
collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

All posts not only go out to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

Note: Private correspondence via email and letters are always =A9 the
author and may not be reproduced in whole or in part without the
written permission of the author. As a general rule, we will not
publish posts that include such material unless they indicate that
permission has been given.

We request that posters limit the number of posts they send to the
list on any given day. Given that our goal is a manageable list
(manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list accepts 75
or fewer messages per day, though these parameters may be changed at
the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

7. Flaming
"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This, of course, includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

So not invalid, but something to take lightly as well as something with

the idea that writing is/was 50 years behind visual art was introduced by
burroughs and gysin. they said of their cutup methodology that they were
just doing something that had been done in visual art for 50 years.

similarly, ken goldsmith brings 'the conceptual' into poetry; conceptual art
has been around for 50 years. since the sixties. his background is in visual
arts.

the literature-time continuum, like the space-time continuum, is full of
dirt bags. that's not quite it. um, full of dirt clumps. dense dirt clumps.
so you get one spot that's literarily present and another that's 150 years
ago. another that's 50 or 100 years ahead. and then it might get even more
complex where one spot is 100 years behind on one issue and 50 years ahead
in another. these dense dirt clumps are basically brains.

the cultures of writing are various, certainly. mostly they are quite
conservative concerning things like technology. and not particularly
adventurous concerning the use of different technologies in writing. whereas
in visual arts, well, experimentation with technology is at a different
level, more often than not. visual arts basically *are* media arts. whereas
the notion that writing is media art isn't quite here yet.

It's hard for me to imagine that anyone can believe that poetry is "behind
art" by 50 years. The points made by David below do a very good job of
addressing the validity of the poetry argument. I think that by inclination,
and by necessity the arts travel through time in tandem with each other, and
with the rest of society. This is especially true in the post-McLuhan era of
instant communication and ubiquitous connectivity, where it is pretty much
impossible for anything (artistic or otherwise) to occur independently of
everything else.

The art market comment is a bit of a "cheap shot", existing as asimulacrum
of the argument that poetry is 50 years behind - the "art industry" is like
the "literature industry". It is in no way representative of what artists
outside the commercial mainstream are doing. I don't think that the art of
poetry writing will be advanced much by knocking the visual arts.

Hi all,I'm starting to work on a bachelor paper at the Free University in
Brussels where I follow Art Sciences and Archaeology.
I'm concentrating on the contemporary arts and my research is directed to
finding a workable definition of Visual Poetry and what the extreme borders
are of Visual Poetry.

If you could help me in looking for what you think a good definition is of
Visual Poetry and where does Visual Poetry start and where does it stop?


Thank you in advance,

Philip

You must be joking, Philip.
The definition of Visual Poetry is the transgression of borders.
You can see that in its coupling of terms; also in its twin invitations to =
the material and the philosophical; and in the way it make everything =
wobble: thought, language, print, paper, preconceptions, and the very many =
overlapping and chiasmic self-definitions it yields.  It is all border, =
imo, even at heart.

Hi all,I'm starting to work on a bachelor paper at the Free University in
Brussels where I follow Art Sciences and Archaeology.
I'm concentrating on the contemporary arts and my research is directed to
finding a workable definition of Visual Poetry and what the extreme =
borders
are of Visual Poetry.

If you could help me in looking for what you think a good definition is of
Visual Poetry and where does Visual Poetry start and where does it stop?


Thank you in advance,

Philip

Considering how few people in the world speak German, to have four
Germanophone laureates within the past 30-some years -- Heinrich Boll,
Gunter Grass, Elfriede Jelinek, and Herta Muller -- seems excessive,
to put it mildly. (Christopher Leland Winks)

The selection of 87% non-German speaking laureates isn't fair?

4 in the last 6 years might seem excessive,
but 4 in 30-something years?
I don't see it.
As re poetry.
There have been quite a few poets named lately, no?

There may be many Europeans, I suppose,
but Nobel was European.
Sweden and Norway are in Europe.

Have a look at Sports Illustrated's sportsman of the year awards. 49 =20

Is that someone with multiple passports?

Hi,

Many of you may not know this, but I am a 15-year veteran Advanced Placement English Literature teacher.I am now in a position, because of my health, that I can no longer teach. I can, however, work on computers from my home. I have created a blog for A.P. English students, parents, and even teachers. If you have any interest in A.P. English for yourself or someone close to you, please visit the site. There's a lot of free commentary by me, plus the opportunity for me to evaluate student work for a fee.

Best,

Jeff

The problem with the "50 years behind" thing is that it means
"progress" exists in art, which is highly arguable.

The Brazilian artist Regina Célia Pinto has created a 2 DVD project on the
work of David Daniels, described below.



*DAVID DANIELS' 200+HUMAN BEINGÈD HYMN TO HUMANITY*

The* American poet David Daniels *(1933-2008) has always amazed me, not only
because of his kindness and wisdom but also the ingenuity with which he
crafted his shape poems with a computer program like “Word for Windows.” It
is impressive to note the quality/innovation of the shapes he obtained with
his texts/poems/animations using software that was not designed for that
purpose. Not only that, but the ease with which he worked and played with
the language is enviable. Reading and observing his poems is always a
process of rediscovery, because they contain a dual semiotic system, one for
writings and the other for imagery.

I followed the creation of his 200 + Humans with a sense of enchantment,
thanks to the vast net that enables artists to exchange experiences in an
international context. This series is fascinating, not only because of its
undeniable artistic value but because of its anthropological aspect. Daniels
constructed his poems by asking many different kinds of people from
different countries some very simple questions. As a result, these poems
reveal similarities and differences, while demonstrating what humans are
like at the beginning of the 21st century. I can’t help imagining what it
would be like if someone read these poems in the next century, and have fun
imagining that person’s (?) response.

It is also interesting to underscore that, mixed in with the human beings
mentioned in the previous paragraph, there are some familiar famous figures,
such as Shakespeare, Edith Piaf, Mozart, Marx, Charles Dickens, Fernando
Pessoa, Kafka, Freud and even Jesus, all of whom are eternally human and
recreated through Daniels’s imagination.

As a result, it is very moving to present the “Humans” series by David
Daniels, which I have produced in DVD format. This will be one more way of
attempting to preserve his Poems.

To know more browser at: http://arteonline.arq.br/humans/

*CONTENT:*

 *DVD 1* – to be inserted in a computer’s DVD drive.
> The Humans series in PDF format, exactly as Daniels produced it.
> The essay *Lift up Your Heads, O Ye Gates, An Appreciation of David
Daniels, *by British author and critic *Edward Picot (http://hyperex.co.uk/)
*.
> The interview with *David Daniels *(http://thegatesofparadise.com) that*
> Jorge
Luiz Antonio*   (http://www.vispo.com/misc/BrazilianDigitalPoetry.htm) and I
conducted in 2004.

*DVD 2* – to be viewed on any DVD player
> A page for all the *humans* in the series, with sound and movement, a
festival of colors and unusual shapes.



For now the DVD boxes will be sent to new media art archives and to Daniel's
family. However, If you are interested or if you are a curator of a library
or university archive, send a message to arteonline.newsletter@gmail.com and
I will contact you soon.

All the best,
Regina Célia Pinto

Robert Archambeau, on his blog, has picked up on Chris Hamilton-Emery's comment that I drew attention to on this mailing list. Kent Johnson mentioned it also in the DE blog comments area after seeing it here. I'm sure he won't mind me mentioning that:

Dear Alan,
This past Sunday evening, we celebrated the Launch of the First Annual UMOVE
Online
Videodance
Festival at The Tank in NYC with curated screenings of the festival
submissions,
  live performances, live video mixing, electronic sounds, and presentations
from
  the festival co-creators discussing the future of dance and media.
It was a wonderful event and we appreciate everyone's attendance and support.
If you couldn't make it, now you too can enjoy all the videos of the UMOVE
Festival
online

Available Online for the month of October 2009 !!
Movement Media's UMOVE Online Videodance Festival reveals how artists are using
online and mobile media to create dances for intimate viewing devices,
including
  computers, ipods and cell phones. The first annual UMOVE Festival reflects a
broad
range of artistic work from novices, video artists working with web cams,
animators
working in Second Life, and experienced film makers.  Dance as an art form is
expanding,
and artists are offering new ways for audiences to view, appreciate, and value
dance
media.
Sick of culling through endless videos of cheerleaders in their kitchens and
Texas
Two Step instruction in to find that ellusive gem of a dance film? UMOVE was
created
in response to "YouTube ennui" in order to make inspiring screendance work
accessible
for discovery by the public on the web.
Enjoy all of the submissions from artists, and view our selections

Forgetting the Burroughs citation, I took this as also referring to
conceptual art. Conceptual art is not only about refusing the notion of
the original but also claims that art thinks and for art to think it
must think original ideas. A break with the painting model of art is
part of this and conceptual poetry had me thinking of various strategies
that may break with the privileged poetry model of literature.
Conceptual poetry then begins with an understanding of the privilege
bestowed on poetry, which is certainly onerous. To claim otherwise is
utopian and a refusal to confront the material conditions of life in
late capitalism and not possible for gay writers intent on a gay
liberationist critique.

To break with the privileged model of painting as a metonym for art or
poetry also standing in for the whole of literature does not mean one
must stop painting or writing verse but rather to understand and find
strategies which may break with these privileged models which stand in
the place of art and blocking any hopeful progress for art.

Anyways, attempting to give a quick other perspective to conceptual art
practices, from an approving gay liberationist agenda.

best wishes, Chris Jones.

I gotta say all this stuff about anything being ahead or behind especially in art seems an absurd notion. Art derives from needs and desires and inspiration of the present and recent past with influences from the further past. It is where it is. It is up to the artists and people who respond to art and the academic and societal structure that supports art to decide what is important now. I think any idea that puts art behind or ahead of its time is missing the point of its value, which seems to me to be help make sense of the time it occurs in and prepare a path into the unknown.

I agree. I think the 50 year thing was claimed by Kenny Goldsmith to
justify his his notion of conceptual poetry, whatever that is.

This year's MLA will feature a public event celebrating the 20th anniversar=
y
of the MLA Off-Site Readings -- I hope everyone will help get word out
around Philadelphia and environs that all are welcome to attend, whether or
not registered for the conference.
I also want to clear up some potential misunderstanding that might arise
from the mention of this reading in the MLA Newsletter that has just gone
out.  As you can see from the description below, the MLA event is a smaller
scale celebration, featuring a handful of poets from previous years'
off-site events.  This is in no way in place of the annual off-site event,
and it is our fervent wish that the good people of Philadelphia, whose
heroic efforts brought us some of our best readings even when the MLA
scrambled back to Philly in the wake of Katrina, will once again find a awa=
y
and a place for us to gathered in our variousness.  There is also one
update:  Mendi Obadike will be appearing in place of Tisa Bryant, who will
not be able to attend MLA this year.

This marks the twentieth anniversary of the MLA off-site poetry reading.
Since the 1989 MLA convention, organizers in host cities have brought
together ever larger groups of experimental and innovative poets for an
evening marathon of poetry performance. These readings bring local poets
into contact with poets from other cities and promote exchange between
poets, scholars, and poet-scholars. The first of these readings was hosted
by a bookstore in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, DC. By 2008
the reading had grown so large that it was held in San Francisco's Yerba
Buena Center, a few blocks from the MLA convention hotels. The special
event, open to the public, will offer short readings by poets, including
several who read at the first event twenty years ago and several newer
poets.

also, it's a little peculiar that she's a "minority" in the sense of
being a relatively privileged German speaker in Romania. Not a
"minority" as the Romany (gypsy) people are.

It can only happen in 'backwards' towns like Laramie, Wyoming? =A0Meanwhile=
, activism leads to comments from liberal friends and their parents like, "=
Why do I need to see all of this gay?" =A0"As long as they don't come on to=
 me!" =A0"Keep it to themselves, behind closed doors!" =A0
The other night in Queens NY, an openly gay man, rather small, out in his n=
eighborhood, went to the local deli for a pack of cigarettes. =A0He was bea=
ten nearly to death and is still close to it, in a coma, for the simple fac=

Today across the US, a second installment of a play, 'The Laramie Project: =
=A0Ten Years Later,' was performed. =A0For what? =A0
What good has national attention to Matthew Shepard's murder achieved ten y=

ways, for the very existence of a population that is "not them" by creating=
 legislation that would strip civil rights away. =A0By beating people. =A0B=

=A0=A0By the continued encouragement of hate towards even young GLBT youth.=
=A0
Unfortunately, the above story is not unusual. =A0To be gay in this country=
 still carries a lethal burden in some cases, despite the "progress" people=

Grace and faux-civil unions. =A0Why do gay teens still suicide three times =
as often as any other teen groups?
WHY? =A0Is it the need for a common enemy? =A0All of the angst to "lock you=

That's a hopelessly closed North American sigh. Most of the world takes it
seriously. And that's a problem.

Interesting view.
Maybe it is a USAmerican view, or a view from the country where most =20
people like to say that they are in the middle class even though they =20=

might wear blue shirts (or teeshirts with insignia) to work at a =20
metalwork shoppe.
So that in the US the word "minority" means the less-privileged?
Irt doesn't mean that everywhere.
For example, in the 19th-20th Century the Swedish-speaking minority =20
in Finland tended to be intellectual, artist and other well-off class.
Remember that Idi Amin kicked the Indian minority out of Uganda =20
because he perceived them as financially better off than Africans.
The white minorities in various African countries didn't compare =20
themselves with Gypsies, etc.

Dear Amy:

For along time i've also been very disturbed bvy what you call the "poetics=
 of hate."  One aspect of this is that language and actions have become sep=
arted.  Thereis an almost magical belief that if somone in Authority in say=
 politics or poetics says something=2C that=2C unquestioningly=2C one is to=
 accept it as truth.

Actions which go against the grain of this "truth" are regraded as somehow =
"wrong" if not factually=2C then in the one way that it counts=2C in an eth=
ico-language one based on "rightness of words rather than actions."

President Obama was thought of as the "peace candidate" and has even won a =
Nobel Peace Prize=2C while al the time he  ran as a candidate he openly adv=
ocated the expansion of the "right war" in Afghanistan and the use of drone=
s from within Pakistan to attack targets inside Pakistan as well as in Afgh=
anistan.  In thelast sevral years it had been learned that most of these at=
tacks tend to kill priomarily numbersof civilians=2C and so turn the "enemy=
" even more against the United states and UN troops.  The killing of civili=
ans alone should give pause=3B but no one seemed to noice any of this and s=
o we had a "peace" candidate and prize winner.

The same huge gap between words and actions involves the health care and li=
ving conditions of most American Indian rezervations--these conditions and =
care are on the same level as in Haiti=2C perennially one of the poorest co=
untries in the world=2C whose own democratic election the US had to interfe=
re with.  =20

You have an article saying that perhaps this President may be the one to gi=
ve an apology to the American indians=2C and that this is bizarre becuase t=
he President is African-American.  At the same time=2C already=2C the Afric=
an-American President has proclaimed over and over his support for an Apart=
heid State.  No one seems to notice this particular bizarre fact/action eit=
her.

Hate crimes have greatly increased against Muslim-Americans=2C and yet ther=
e is little outcry about this.  Billions were stolen from American citizens=
 yet it is these citizens who are to pay the immense bailouts for Wall Stre=
et=2C where noneof the crimianls goes to prison except Bernie Maddoff.

The battle over health care has been turned into a complete travesty and th=
e insurance and pharmaceutical companies are running roughshod over the US =
Government--again the citizens will be paying for whatever nightmare disast=
rer is created in the end to pass as "Historic Legislation."

Due in good part to the war in Afghanistan=2C there has been a huge increas=
e in the numbers affected in the ongoing holocausts of drug users and their=
 families=2C their neighborhoods=2C in this country in the last eight years=
.  In the last decades untold numbers of people's lives have been torpedoed=
 by the flood of drugs that is basically allowed to enter the country=2C of=
ten in trade for the guns anyone almost can buy at wear at Public Town Hall=
 meetings in the US.

And despite al the gains made by American Gay citizens in terms of national=
 awareness and some measure of public acknowledgment=2C the same violence a=
s ever continues with very little protection from the police and other "gua=
rdians" of the peace. I have Gay relative who i am always finding myself wo=
rrying about=2C no matter where they live (including NYC.)

I think if one examines the immense gaps between the uses of language and a=
ppearances in terms of the media and institutions=2C and the actual actions=
 and policies imposed on American citizens as well as the countries effecte=
d by American policies and actions=2C one finds a massive inter related "la=
nguage manipulation" at every level of the society and culture.  The only w=
ay to be able to sustain the contradictions between perceptions and speeche=
s and the actual events and policies=2C is to begin to create not only a se=
ries of compartmentalized double standards=2C so that what is in each one w=
on't be taken not of in the next one=2C and also the project of orwells 198=
4=2C in which "peace=3DWar".  That is=2C contradictions are made to be "equ=
al" in such a way that it is impossible to ask any questions of the languag=
e itself or of the actions and the policies of the leaders.

I think if one looks at the remarkable consistency of "hate" poetics and ac=
tions from the US supportof Apartheid=2C ethnic cleansing=2C massive destab=
ilization of nations=2C economic misery imposed on the citizens here and ab=
road=2C launching of ever wider wars=2C the continued use of torture=2C and=
 the actions inside the USA against its citizens who are hated for al the w=
ell known reasons--one finds that it is one long arc of violence against th=
e Other=2C still=2Cdespite the good feeling caused by the election.  From A=
partheid to the American Indian rezervations there is a double standard for=
 human beings in the eyes of the US.  Basically it is what one might call a=
 contempt for the ideas of equality among persons and the freedom of people=
s to govern themselves. In short=2C  a contempt for Human Rights=2C in whic=
h =2C as Orwell writes in Animal Farm--"All animals are equal but some are =
more equal than others."

Sadly=2C there is also a form of contempt for language itself=2C because it=
 is words which are used to make people think that one thing or person is b=
etter than another=2C it is words that make persons think lies are unquesti=
oned truths=2C it is words that divide persons unnecessarily in order to di=
vide Rights and any of the rights to Life and health of all. And despite pr=
ofessions to the contrary--the actions of the society show who and what it =
actually is. Language is used not as a means of critique=2C but as a means =
of denial=2C evasions=2C avoidance of responsibility=2C or the justificatio=
n for a sheer ignorance masking itself as ("noble") disinterestedness.

Ironically=2C the policing of words is often far greater than the actual po=
licing of violence.  Yet=2C that word policing may create for a many the il=
lusion that things have changed=2C or that "such things can't be true" or '=
don't happen=2C" or "we don't have anything to do with that=2C we're good p=
eople."  Wheter supporting violence or being agsint it=2C the uses oflangua=
ge operate at on=3By selected and specific sites=2C carefully chosen and co=
mpartmentlaized so that one does not ask just about one group's Rights=2C b=
ut all--in thatmanner=2C if the Rights of al are are put forward=2C the rig=
hts of the specific wil be fouhgt for also.  To only demand for one faction=
 in asnese is to create again the double standards and hypcoirsiy which goe=
s with denying Rights to some=2C while others are effectively deleted=2C er=
ased=2C vanished=2C hidden away--and are given nesxto to know acknowledgmen=
t language=2C which is to be reserved only for those considered to be worth=
y of it.

There is a colossal outbreak of violence among teens and children this year=
 in Chicago--al manner of explanations are put forward. Yet when the whole =
society is so su[pportive of vioelnce agsint some one somewhere=2C how are =
these children to think that killing and beating is anything out of the ord=
inary?  Especially when the environment is one in which only the strong=2C =
the grouped together and the armed are going to survive every long.  Isn't =
that part of the language of "American individualism" combined with a sense=
 of at least a temporary "teamwork?"  How different are drug gangs in Ameri=
can cities from the troops and the troopsof our various allies going beserk=
 in the Middle East? =20

A "poetics of hate" then is one in which denial of connections between acti=
ons and words has to be made=2C in order to preserve the hierarchies of Rig=
hts among persons here and those Americans are imposing on abroad. Once the=
 denials have been made=2C then the War =3DPeace' newspeak becomes possible=
=2C for as much as possible al contradictions and double standards need to =
be removed from sight and from critiue=2C from language itself. That way Ap=
arthied=2C Rezervations=2C ethnic cleansing=2C massive theft and deaths of =
citizens from childhood on will be the name of the game=2C the order of the=
 day. In order to justify the contempt for human life and Rights towards so=
 many while using the most "cleaned up" and "liberal" language possible--wh=
at kind of lying is goping on inside one? Inside one's thoughts=2C one's la=
nguage--that is really only just a tiny distance away from violence--? beca=
use of the denial of violence in some cases while justifying it in others--=
in which case al language about violence begins to be what it always has be=
en--propaganda for further violence and further blindness to the "wrong " v=
iolence while in favor of the "right."

Three new volumes from white sky books by Peter Ganick. check 'em out.
Originally written during 1994 and 1995, the texts show Ganick in a
different light. The texts are referential, somewhat lyrical, and freshly
reintroduced to readers. A short selection appeared with the SUNY/Buffalo
Electronic Poetry Center pages, otherwise they are previously unpublished.


Read them for free through the preview function, download them for a minimal
fee, or purchase the print copy.

There is something on this theme in my essay on "Field Poetics" in the
current EOAGH. Additionally, sometime around 1973, Klaus Peter Decker wrote
of the signal difference between concrete poetry and poesia visiva as one of
context. In 1986, I translated his words n the topic in this way, "If
concrete poetry has sharpened an awareness of language, so visual poetry
attempts-while at the same time building on that basis and perhaps carrying
it further-to develop an awareness of the context of language, an awareness
of the language around us." For Dencker, as for Luciano Ori, that context is
the mediated environment, dominated by commercial imagery. Ori's words are
from a catalog for the exhibit, "La Poesia Visiva (1963-1979). Both texts
maybe found in O.ARS 5: Translations Experiments in Reading.

Other issues aside, we can distinguish, semiotically, using Peirce's
typology, traditionally printed or text-based poetry from so-called
visual poetry.  In traditional text-based poetry signification occurs
symbolically; in "visual" poetry, signification occurs both
symbolically and iconically.  Indexical signification is sometimes
thrown in, too.

Best,

WT

How many people speak Chinese?  Well then,. how many Nobel Laureates from China have there been?  How many Latin Americans?  (Not many.)  How many Brazilians?  How many from South Asia?  How many from sub-Saharan Africa who don't happen to be white (so there go Lessing, Gordimer, and Coetzee)?  How many Arabs?  (Only Mahfouz.)

Johanna, I appreciate your remarks. I do think that even for those who cons=
ider themselves liberal Americans, often there is a swagger to their talk. =
I also have an immigrant mom from Europe, and she has helped me look at all=
 sides with compassion. I don't know if it is because she saw WWII, or if t=
hat is simply her nature.=20

The remarks to this forum over a writer who has given us all a glimpse into=
 a part of the world that is only sensationalized by the media are rather t=
elling as to why American writers do not win the Nobel Prize. Furthermore, =
there are many of us who do believe it a honour that merits respect. Euroce=
ntrism is a rather heavy charge to launch against the academy. I consider m=
yself European and often times critical of policies that come out governmen=
ts that are not always sensitive to the poor, the disenfranchised and those=
 who are minorities (and by the way I am a monority-my mother is European, =
my father was American), and yet I experienced a more open society than the=
 one I am living in now, one that is unwilling to examine its deep seated p=
rejudices-one that Americentric (if I may create a word here). I am very pr=
oud that a German woman is recognized by the academy for her work- we might=
 also stop here to consider that finally women are being honoured
 for their contributions. Alas, I am rambling, but I could not let these re=
marks go unanswered.=20

Since you mention La poesia visiva, I can't but remind us of Ugo Carrega,
founder of La Nuova Scrittura (1967) and Il Mercato del Sale (1974).
There are a couple of "unluckily" I must mention, one is that Ugo does not
like pc's, that is why he is not known to the cyber-public, the second is
that he sent me two full CD's with his superb work for the Poets' Corner
(besides several -literally- boxes of his books) but saved on a Mac and
there is no way for me to upload the pictures.

Johanna,

I sent the following to another list for Obama's Nobel Prize and I
highlighted Alonzo L. Hamby's comment which might be of interest to you on
this forum,
from *The New York Times*:
http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/what-does-a-nobel
-do-for-us-leaders/?hp
And I think there is some truth in them all.

But the Norwegian Nobel Committee never claimed they were giving President
Obama the award for his nine-month old presidency. Barack Obama, it seems,
deserved the Nobel for his audacious ability to navigate the curse of racis=
m
with unparalleled integrity and high-mindedness.
*Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, is the author
of =93The Wilderness Warrior=94 and the editor of =93The Reagan Diaries.=94=
*
**
**Mr. Obama, by contrast, is vaguely =93un-American=94: soft of language, s=
oft
of power, an American social democrat out to make his country more
=93European=94 =97 always ready to reach out to those who do not reach out =
to the
West, nor wish it well. This is how the Europeans, once a race of conqueror=
s
and colonizers, like to see themselves: peaceable, cooperative, high-minded
=97 that is, in a more advanced stage of development than Bushist America.
*Josef Joffe, on leave as the editor of Die Zeit, the German weekly, is a
senior fellow at the Freeman-Spogli Institute for International Studies and
Abramowitz Fellow at the Hoover Institution, both at Stanford University.*
**
** *American writers, the literature committee has told us, need not aspire
to the literature award. *
*Alonzo L. Hamby <http://mahg.ashland.edu/faculty/hamby.html>, a professor
at Ohio University, is the author of =93For the Survival of Democracy:
Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s=94 and =93Man of the
People: A Life of Harry S. Truman.=94 *
**
**

Barack Obama, it now seems clear, is a lucky man. Not that he isn=92t
talented. He is at least as smart as Carter, as good on a podium as Reagan,
and as good at press wrangling as J.F.K. But all this and more would not
bring him from an Illinois Senate seat to the White House in five years
without Lady Luck.

And if anybody had any lingering doubts, the Nobel nod came just when he
needed a break =97 blotting out the memory of the Olympic fiasco in
Copenhagen. Once again, President Obama is the unrivaled star of the
political heavens.
But everything has a downside, even luck.
*Walter Russell Mead
<http://www.cfr.org/bios/3495/walter_russell_mead.html>is the
Kissinger Senior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy at the Council of
Foreign Relations. He is author of =93Special Providence: American Foreign
Policy and How It Changed the World.=94 *

It also seems that her work has not been translated into English, yet.

Best wishes, Anny Ballardini

ROCKPILE is a collaboration between David Meltzer * poet, musician,
essayist, and more * and Michael Rothenberg of Big Bridge Press. David
and Michael will journey through eight cities in the U.S. to perform
poetry and prose, composed while on the road, with local musicians and
artists in each city. ROCKPILE will serve to educate and preserve as
well as to create a history of collaboration. It will help to reinforce
the tradition of the troubadour of all generations, central to the
cultural upheaval and identity politics that reawakened poets, artists,
musicians, and songwriters in the mid-1960s through the 1970s. The
project will end with a final multimedia performance in San Francisco.

SALMON POETRY

(of Knockeven at the
Cliffs of Moher in
County Clare, Ireland)

invites you to celebrate
the publication of
"Uttering Her Name" by the
Irish poet Gabriel Rosenstock

http://www.salmonpoetry.com/uttering.html

The event will take place on Thursday the 15th of October at 6:30 p.m.
in The Unitarian Church, 112 West St. Stephen=92s Green, Dublin 2,
Ireland.

"Uttering Her Name" consists of spontaneous, ecstatic utterances in a
neo-bhakti style, that is to say a modern slant on those poems of
intense devotion which are still read and chanted in India today.

David Butler, in Poetry Ireland Review, wrote:  "With more than one
hundred books to his name, Rosenstock has set himself up as something
of a Gaelic shaman, as likely to invoke Buddha or Xolotl as any
chthonic Celtic deity."

P=E1draig de Paor, in Poetry International, wrote:  "Rosenstock is so
famously difficult to pin down, that one is slow to try to describe
him at all.  Indeed, this foxy elusiveness may be his defining
feature."

Gabriel Rosenstock has authored more than 160 books!  "Uttering Her
Name" is his d=E9but volume in English.

I want to thank all of you that contributed and hope to read more
contributions still that can help me in my quest.If you know of good
referential books, thesisses, papers,.... please let me know.

I wanted to work around the topic of visual poetry because, together with
performance poetry, slam poetry and sound poetry, visual poetry is not
getting any funding here in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium). It i=
s
seen as not being part of Literature and therefor the work invested by poet=
s
and artists to go to festivals, readings, try to get published isn't
recognised and mostly no stipendium is given because of this too. Most
experimental poetry is considered as a fashion/fase that will pass by and i=
s
not to be taken seriously nor taken into account. Hence my willingness to
prove that Visual Poetry is part of an international movement that has root=
s
and a history and also has a future ahead.
Since I'm a mostly involved and therefor a concerned party in the
performance and sound poetry part (also a bit in slam poetry) I decided to
work on visual poetry. I think it's not good to be researcher and poet in
the same field, it makes you too involved and subjective and hence the
research could be interpreted wronly. (Although I must admit that I do writ=
e
sometimes visual poetry too).

I'm studying Art Sciences and Archaeology at VUB in Brussels (Belgium) and =
I
thought it would be an interesting starting point to start from drawing,
painting, colage, photography,... into the poetics and into language as
such.

Since I have always, also in my poetry, worked around communication,
language and the ways of (not) understanding each other through these
different forms of communication, I thought this would be a good basis for =
a
definition too.

But finding a workable definition that suits all forms of (visual) poetry i=
s
not easy. Hence my call at you all here in this poetics list.
Indeed some of the reactions seem to state that I can't ask for the obvious=
,
but the more I try to find a good definition that include philosophical
ideas of language, descriptive forms of communication, ways of
understanding, images, concepts, interpretation, art, structure and content
I find myself lost again.
Next to that a lot of definitions are suited for one or two forms of
(concrete) poetry, but seem not to take into account other forms of visual
poetry and sometimes even the link with poetry (as a form of Literature)
seems to be lost whatsoever. So back to the drawing board.

My first aim, in my bachelor paper, is to find a definition of visual
poetry. But in this, one need to research also the history of visual poetry=
.
In this part of my paper I want to give a brief overview of the historical
context, included the elements of the definition with the ancestoral form
and examples of (visual) poetry.

Of course poetry is derived of Greek where it has the meaning of "making" o=
r
"constructing" something "artificial".

My idea was to construct a  historical structure into my paper as follows:

*A visual poetry history starting with Malarme and Appolinaire. *
**Question here is if I need to start earlier and if so, how far back do I
need to go? Take also different forms of petrogliefs and hierogliefs into
account?
*Part two* would continue with the *Dada-movement* and the *Cubists?* with
their *collages* also including the *Russian Futurists* and the *
Zaum-movement* of Velimir Hlebnikov and Mayakovski.
Part *three* would bring us at the *Surrealists* (*Magritte* has a great
article on words and images in his series "the *treason of the image*" and
now with the new Magritte Museum here in Brussels, this would help a lot in
defining visual poetry I think)
So to flow into *Cobra, Fluxus, Wiener Action Gruppe, John Cage* (and
the *notation
systems* of his *sound poetry* and of other sound poets as Jackson Mac Low,
Jerome Rothenberg e.a.) and *Concrete Poetry*.
I would at this point in my paper want to take some time to present a
few *representative
contemporary visual poets (World, Europe, Belgium)*, but also visual poetry
magazines, books, festivals...
Of course *including *more *contemporary movements* (*mailart* movements
e.g.).
I would at the *end *come to some *questions *concerning the *inclusion *(o=
r
not of) *Video-poetry, Second Life performances* and *internet* (so visual)
poetry and *other new media forms of poetry* should be *considered as Visua=
l
Poetry*.


This is how I see things now and I consider this as a very open skeleton of
my paper in which a lot of parts can be changed, added,... like a mecano
structure.
I hope to start a discussion with you all on this and with your imput be
able to work towards an acceptable result for myself, my professors, the
Faculty of Archaeology and Art Sciences of the Free University of Brussels,
you all and my peers. (although I know that pleasing all of those will be a=
n
almost impossible task)

As you see, this will not be a work of one weekend or week, but I hope to
finish a first paper (my bachelor paper) next year.

Looking forward to more comments, propositions, informations, book titles
and articles and links to different scientific research on this topic.

Thank you all very much in advance.

What about Orhan Pamuk? Does that mean that the academy sees Turkey now as

"I consider myself European."

But ARE you?

I would also like to point out that you're referencing ONE person on a

representative of anything near unanimity is dead wrong.

Does anyone know why many 19th century novelists use the abbreviation,
---shire, instead of the full place name or a fictional place name?
Thanks.

Alfred Nobel was a European, and the prize and its criteria were fashioned
after European interests.  I doubt a Chinese, Japanese, or Hindi speaker has
ever reviewed anything other than scientific journals written by Asians in
consideration for any of the Nobel prizes.  Only the Peace prize, which
doesn't rely on anything written by the honoree has been awarded to anyone
with a non-European lineage.  Then there's the issue of South America.
They're primarily of European descent, i.e., Spanish, Portuguese, German.
They don't win because they're mostly out of sight of most Nobel vetters.
It should change, but I ain't holdin' my breath.

Oh, this is well-reasoned.
And it applies to the other Nobel prizes as well.
How many sub-Saharan Africans have won the Nobel prize for chemistry
or physics?

Or the other prizes.
How many Russians have won the Academy Awards?

The Hole

I have gone into this hole many times.
There's not much here
except a matchbook and a burnt out light bulb.

I do not think to throw out the light bulb,
souvenir that it is.
It reminds me of days
I sat in a room that swelled with light,
a room filled with dictionaries and encyclopedias

I do not step into this room anymore
only because I burned it down
when I got tired of its brightness,

too bright with knowledge
that I could not absorb.

And in that room
dwell blackened words
trapped within charred notebooks.

Yet tonight I steal into that room,
park Indian style, blind as a TV screen
stacked with snow.

From this shack,
I seize matches, set 'em off,
to refute the light bulb, refute night.

I also have an immigrant mom from Europe, and she has helped me look at all sides with compassion. I don't know if it is because she saw WWII, or if that is simply her nature.

> The remarks to this forum over a writer who has given us all a glimpse into a part of the world that is only sensationalized by the media are rather telling as to why American writers do not win the Nobel Prize. Furthermore, there are many of us who do believe it a honour that merits respect. Eurocentrism is a rather heavy charge to launch against the academy. I consider myself European and often times critical of policies that come out governments that are not always sensitive to the poor, the disenfranchised and those who are minorities (and by the way I am a monority-my mother is European, my father was American), and yet I experienced a more open society than the one I am living in now, one that is unwilling to examine its deep seated prejudices-one that Americentric (if I may create a word here). I am very proud that a German woman is recognized by the academy for her work- we might also stop here to consider that finally women are being honoured

For a quick take on the latest Chax Press book, check out Mark
Scroggins's blog entry on PRESOCRATIC BLUES by Joel Bettridge:

http://kulturindustrie.blogspot.com/

and while you're at it, visit

http://chax.org and have a look at ta(l)king eyes, by Jacque Brogan,
and other recent books from Chax Press. There will be more to come
there, with updates and additions of 3 new books expected within a week.

Also, Chax Press & VOICES, Inc. (a Tucson based youth literacy,
education, and empowerment organization) are sharing a benefit
fundraiser on Oct 30, 7pm, at The Rogue Theatre, 300 E. University
Blvd in Tucson. All tickets are $10, available by phone from Chax
Press (520-620-1626) or at Bentley's House of Coffee & Tea, or
Antigone Books in Tucson.

The event features new books and readings by LINH DINH, STEPHANIE
BALZER, and JONATHAN ROTHSCHILD. Linh Dinh's new book from Chax Press
(one of those we will add to the web site within the week) is SOME
KIND OF CHEESE ORGY ($16). Jonathan Rothschild's first book, THE LAST
CLUBHOUSE EULOGY ($15) is similarly new from Chax Press. Stephanie
Balzer has two forthcoming chapbooks -- one from Kore Press and one
from CUE Editions (all presses in Tucson).

If you can be in Tucson and attend, HOORAY! If you can't, please
consider buying one or more tickets and allowing us to give them away
to a deserving student or poet who could not otherwise attend. You
could make that contribution toward tickets at
http://chax.org/donate.htm -- and just let us know that you intend it
for a ticket purchase either for yourself or to be given away to a
deserving poetry lover.

Best wishes to all!

I liked the Les Figues writers commenting on each other. I'm also happy that
(Pro)Feminist men are writing.
Some feminism is Ann the electrician with her job uphill at the University
lending tools to Masha who teaches math at the high school.

I remember a time when oranges were at least 53 years behind watermelons. Eventually they surpassed the melon and are now the most innovative fruit in the biz.

On the other hand, when i read or scan certain graphic novels, i then to agree with Chirot.

Thanks for this. I'm not sure why his fiction is considered difficult; I
found it quite lucid, direct, and honest.
He had such great energy.

Dear Phillip Meersman:

There is no fixed definition of Visual Poetry, nor delimitation of its
boundaries.  There are as many definitions or limits of what is considered
Visual Poetry as there are serious Visual Poets.  Much also depends on the
period which is assigned by the Visual Poet as the "beginnings of Visual
Poetry."  For many, the "Modern Visual Poetry" if not what is considered
Western Visual Poetry, begins with Mallarme's "Un Coup de des;" for others
it is the earliest Cave Paintings and Petroglyphs.

One may indeed think of Visual--and Sound--Poetires and thier realtive Mail
Art--as continually changing and devloping its own defintions and boundaries
via the introductions more and more frequnet of new technlogies with which
to create the works.  Often the writings "about" or "on" Visual Poetry for
themost part tend to be a little bit "behind" some of the emerging examples
in a way which is very productive in that things are not immediately seized
on and classified, marketed in the same way they may be in Poetry and
Poetics for example.
Conversely, because the Past in Visual Poetry is often as little or unknown
as the present and Future, elements of the Past whether anicent or recent
are continaully reappearing in different contexts and combinations and at
times becoming al over again large "rivers" o, if more a trendy detour,
smaller "tributaries."  Currently there is a revival of interest/discovery
of interstin the large area of Asemic Writing, which itself has a istory and
examples, figues which need to be investigated and understood in new ways,
or simply found for the first time no matter their agein time.  Tis is
perhaps more common in Visual and Sound Poetries than in ,say, poetry, as
there has been on the whole such an ignorance of Visual poetry and Sound
Poetry through time despite someof the greatest arits/poetsof the 20th
century being creatorsin these areas.

One of the great strengths--and perhaps for non Visual Poets, one of the
"weaknesses"--is precisely this heterogeneity of definitions,
circumferences, beginnings etc.  Despite various efforts to centralize or
rein in Visual Poetry under a few rubrics, the movements of Visual Poet are
horizontal and rhizomatic-- and in this way more elusive of the
hierarchical, vertical "Tree" structuring of knowledge as Delueze and
Guattari would say, and more productive in the rhizomatic non-centralized
movements and directions.

The best way to learn of Visual Poetry is from--who else--??--!!--Visual
Poets, whose works and writings, histories and ideas may be found at a great
many sites on line, as wel as spread out through various blogs and lists on
line and many books, anthologies and journals in print and out of print
through time..

There are also continually exhibitions of Visual Poetry throughout the world
as well as those which combine Mail Art and Visual Poetry.  These Calls will
have some information regarding their themes and their own web and "real
world" addresses which help give snap shots of current interests of the
Visual Poetry/Mail Art international communities as wel as those within
certain geographical or linguistic areas. (The liberation of the Catalan
language, for example, after long suppression under Franco, has aided in the
explosion of a great deal of work in that language and in the Catalan region
of Spain.  historically there have been many great Visual Poets from this
area, their works often too little known outside of their immediate areas,
though more recently ever more especially among Latin language countries and
peoples.)

If you would like back channel i can send you a listing of many of the
blogs, web sites, places to find further information, on line anthologies
etc--for starters an excellent one in English is the Light and Dust web
site; also there are the site called Boek 861 which has a great amount of
materials in Spanish with most translated into English if not originally in
English.  There are historical theoretical Visual, Sonic texts and superb
essays at both Light and Dust and Boek 861.  There are also Vortice
Argentina and several new sites with great materials in Russian and Serb
languages with many amazing examples and increasingly some English language
texts and examples for example.
You wil find perusing the blogs that there is a huge range of ideas re what
is Visual Poetry, and ways of making it, and methods, historical examples,
controversies and the like.  Most good Visual Poetry blogs and sites have a
wide range of links to others--for example there is geof Huth's dbqp, Crag
Hill's Scorecard, with links to a huge number of others including my own.
There is also a site called Vispoets.com at which there are literally
thousands of works by hundreds of Visual Poets from the world round.

For an elist which has frequent discussion and projects of Visual Poetry in
English there is spidertangle@yahoogroups.com

On you tube and at the UbuWerb you will find a huge number of historical and
contemporary Visual Poetry events, videos, documentaries, recordings of
sonic performance of visual poetry scores, interviews etc.  The great
Uruguayan Visual/Sound Poet Clemente Padin for example has not only a huge
number of writings and Visual Works on line, but also a great number of
performances which continue to appear several times a year. And Clemente is
but one of an increasingly large number of Visual Poets who are finding ways
to utilise the new technologies.

Historically, Visual Poetry has developed and found a wider audience each
time a new technology capable of reproducing words and images or words
arranged in unconventional (previously) arrangements appears.  The printing
press, the typewriter, the X-ray, the photograph, the film the video, the
telegraph, the variety of copiers which have appeared, al these have had
great influences on both the reception of Visual Poetry and its methods and
examples.  There is a huge research for example taking place continually now
in what is possible with digital technologies in the making of Visual/Sound
Poetries. The tape recorder from the heavy duty reel to reel to the latest
digital machines for example have had a continual influence n changes in
Sound Poetry, as well as influencing in turn the notations for Sound Poetry,
which are Visual Scores of an incredibly wide Variety.
As an introduction in English the best site I can recommend is Karl Young's
Light and Dust, as Karl covers not only Western but also Asian and Moslem
calligraphers and Visual poetries at his site.  He has some great essays of
his own but also essays and complete larger texts by a wider range of Visual
Pots working at different times in different materials and with differing
methods.  For example, you'll find three areas which have influenced myself
alot--the Russian Zaum Visual/Sonic poetires, the examples from Lettrisme
and those from Latin America as wel as the Visual/Sound Works of bpNichol,
the Visual Works of da levy & of the American poet Robert Grenier, whose
work investigates an area which one cal or not Visual Poetry but is the
Visual essaying of a language in which the words are literally the things.
There is also Mayan Visual Poetry Language and much much else; each of these
directions you can then find a huge number of more examples on line and in
print.

Also to remember when beginning to learn of Visual Poetry is that each
artist, essayist, historian may or does have their own particular point of
view or even agenda to correspond with their point of view, of what Visual
Poetry is/isn't/should be/was/may be in future.  Rather than trying to take
one or other as THE centralized Capital of knowlelge or as THE authority it
is best to keep all of the view points in  mind as after al then the "View"
or "scene" of Visual Poetry will expose itself in al its great variety,
colors, sounds, ideas, semantics, linguistic orientations and its
explorations continually of new technologies as well as of the most
ancient.  (A lot of my work is done with the oldest forms of
copying--"rubBEings" and clay impression paintings--the most ancient and
most childlike of the methods--which can be internationally exhibited via
the latest in technologies--another example of Visual Poetries carrying
within them at once the most ancient of their origins so called whether in
Mallarme or the Caves, and making use always immediately of any new
technology.)

As i wrote, i can send you backchannel some lists of addresses sites
etc--each one of which has its own links, examples, ideas and each of those
more in turn--)



Many Mail Art sites also carry a great deal of information and examples of
Visual and Sound, Performance and Event Poetries. Often there is the phrase
in one form or another re Visual Poetry to the effect of VisiVociVerbal ,
But one can extend it really to what i cal Visual-Sonic-Visceral as a lot of
Visual Poetry is meant to be performed, not simply "seen" or "read" alone,
nor simply "heard" either.  Much work demands, "calls for"literally and
figuratively, a Visceral, choreographic response. You'll find this approach
writen of and reperesnted often via photos, scores, recordings, videos etc
at more and more sites today--

(The great English Visual/Sound/Verbal/Performance poet and editor Bob
Cobbing worked very much across al these areas simultaneously, which enabled
him to use anything as a score--not simply letters and words but the lines,
textures of the surfaces of  a stone held in the hand for example, or we
used to perform sidewalk cracks as "texts" for visceral poetry--
Cobbing also edited many great anthologies of  Visual and Sound Poetries and
one of the greatest historical volumes, in company with the German poet
Peter mayer; these can be found in the rare Books collections or in some
libraries themselves--One anthology made not long before Bob's death
includes the word "Choreography" very specifically in the title along with
the VerbiVisisVoci types of examples--
Karl Young at his Light and Dust site has a classic essay on this aspect of
Visual poetry--"Notation and the Art of Reading"--


Denis Charmot, for example, a French site  a huge number of links and texts
in both directions.  There are the blogs such Gianni Simone's, Luc Fiernes,
Guido Vermeulen etc etc etc--so many!--Whether or not you can read any or
one of the Romance languages, these are a great help as vast amounts of
writings on line are especially in Spanish but also French, Italian,
Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese and Catalan.  (Actually i learned a lot of
Spanish and Portuguese from reading these sites through time, another
benefit of the Mail Art/Visual Poetry.)

I think the only way to understand the definitions of Visual Poetry--which i
think of as myriad and in flux also --along with the "extreme borders" which
also may vary with developments as well, is to study as many examples,
essays, performances recordings as one is able to --i know there's time
limits etc!-  simply because with so many differing ideas and points of
view, is best to oneself "bear these in mind" oneself while thinking through
what to oneslef may be the "most striking features" and so forth towards
definitions limits and the like--which in a way, personally i think of as
provisional--for better or worse--but then working in an area one really
prefers for oneself at any rate feels "more room to move" when there are
"fewer boundaries, walls, definitions, identity papieren und so weiter . . .
or what Robert Smithson called cultural confinement--"

For example, in re "extremes" and "limits"--the artist/poet/critic jw curry
wrote that Bob Cobbing and i were at the "extreme edge" of what is called
"Dirty" Visual Poetry, which curry called the "Quick'n'Dirty School"--that
is, that the dirtiness of the materials is part of the actual images and
sounds themselves in contradistinction to the clean lines and neat
appearances of most Visual Poetry. (Which is further emphasized in good part
at this time  by the use of digital technologies as opposed to say those
which lend themelves to some smudginess--) The Dirty means in part the
inclusion and uses of, treatment as, al elements within a
Visual/Sonic/Visceral Field as being 'language" and
expression/communication.  This dispenses with the need for letters let
alone words, with the forms themselves being the notations, or the colors,
or the interactions among these--in this manner the accident is as much as
the intentional an aspect of the work's movements and directions as a poetic
action score--a movement and direction which one "feels" viscerally as wel
as emotionally/spiritually/intellectually.  in this way the "dirtiness even
of letterings and words which do appear are components which are --ARE--
really the letter, rather than "additions" or "accidental inclusions or
smudges"--

Right there is an element of discussion/controversy for some Visual
Poets--what is the limit or extreme--the letter, a fragment of a letter--or
a word--a morpheme--or simply the disappearance of these into the chaos from
which they wil again emerge as something else or Other via negentropy.  (A
lot of my works are re the vanishing and altering of letters, words through
time vby weather, war, fires insects, vegetation growths, rusts and
etc--and, often, out of these emerging "new languages"--)

So right there is an example of the question of limits, which among Visual
Poets themselves is a question which is not a "settled" or "fixed" one, but
perhaps one which may have a majority consensus on the one hand and a great
variety of other responses and examples also, which are limited to smaller
numbers of Visual poets--

I hope this may be of use-and forgve my using my works at times as examples;
it is because i hesitate to paraphrase or define the works of others that
you may not yet know.  I don't want to create "images/ideas ahead of time"
as much as possible!
besides what i say of my own work may not be "apparent"--who knows1 i the
works themselves, which may after all "tell a different tale' than the one
who thought he knew--presumed to know as Foucault would say, that character
known as old Mr Know it all!--whom one knows oneself certainly not to be for
sure-

Dear Philip,

I've been following the discussion a bit about visual and concrete poetry. =
 I sometimes work in that medium=97not because there is something special a=
bout visual poetry that attracts me but rather because of my theoretical in=
terests, or perhaps my methodological ones.  I happened upon visual poetry =
(making it), very young, before I knew there were other people doing anythi=
ng like it besides Apollinaire and Oulipo and it happened rather out of a m=
otivation towards expression (or towards undoing expression) than towards a=
n aesthetic elan so to speak.

I can't speak for all visual poets, but I do think something that is someti=
mes shared among visual poets is the interest to undo or redo language and =
the way it expresses.  Language=97in traditional linguistics and philosophy=
, and even in literature=97is often seen has having a kind of "top-side" an=
d "underside" or an "inside" and an "outside" or "form" and "content" or wh=
at have you.    This can be theorized in many ways (and with many different=
 kinds of vocabulary over the years) but I suppose the way I usually think =
about it (you're probably familiar with these ideas and I hope I'm not insu=
lting you by reiterating them) is that you have the word or the phrase or t=
he letter or whatever "unit" of language you're working with (sometimes vis=
ual poets work with uncommon "units" too, or non-units, ha) and then you ha=
ve whatever it refers to.  And so language is split.  A part of it is tangi=
ble and a part of it is not:  a part of it present, and a part absent.   Sa=
ussure would call this signifier and signified, but when it comes to poetry=
 that terminology I believe is severely limited (especially as far as visua=
l poetry is concerned).  I also think this idea is often present in the stu=
dy of "poetics" whatever that is.=20=20

I think visual poetry often expresses an interest in making poetry with the=
 materiality of language, both or sometimes as a way of moving the medium o=
f language closer to something material, like paint, or clay, but also some=
times as a way of unveiling or experimenting with the ways that "expression=
" and "material" may be conceived as happening in the same gesture, and in =
a way enact very literally an undoing of this dichotomy within language tha=
t is more than a little problematic and probably is not a very accurate way=
 of understanding language scientifically (among other things).  And experi=
menting with language in other ways too of course.=20=20

I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I started doing visual poetry not =
only as a way of making new poetry but also as a way of understanding langu=
age in a new way, and this may be something common with other visual poets =
(although perhaps not all).=20=20

Feel free to email me if you want to talk more about this:  lilyrobertfoley=

re on Beckett, Bolano and Derrida, so it could be interesting to be in cont=

Well, Mr. Bowering, on this particular slippery slope, you're one step short of (overrated Nobel laureate) Saul Bellow's "Show me the Zulu Tolstoy!"  In any case, I bet there have been some Russian films that have won Best Foreign Picture in the Academy Awards.  And are you saying, "Well, these Africans, they just lack skills in chemistry, otherwise they would SURELY, in the objective world of the Nobel Committtees and the level playing field from which these committees operate, have cleaned up on the prize front ages ago"?

Interesting how some other comments have claimed the status of oppressed group based on their European ancestry.  Maybe they should read "Discourse on Colonialism" by a great poet who (probably because of this text) never won the Nobel.

I really like that explanation Lily.

I would add a different dimension too. Your note provides a very thoughtful
summary of visual poetry from the poetics approach, i.e. how a poet moves
into the realm of visual communication. For me, the special beauty of Visual
Poetry is that it is equally approachable from the other direction, as
visual artists move into the realm of language and poetry.

So, while we have poets who start with text and move towards concrete
poetry, typeface patterning, and text-based visual work, we have artists
creating visual work that is based on how language appears on the page...
things like glyphs and ascemic writing.

The banker comes out of the maid's room
with a clothespin on his nose, mimicking an
adenoidal lion's grrrff and a canary's
coalmined peep, calling out
their names as his children run around him,
howling with laughter.  His wife sips
from her Nagasaki teacup, shakes her head,
glances at the clock on the mantel, but smiles
with her eyes, as he sinks on all fours like a bear.

The boy Gerald is splashing
through the puddles cobble-
tupped in Rue Git-Le-Coeur,
avoiding the ones where he can see
reflected red, his Hermes-flight
in inadvertent stalk of Modi's widow;
Amedeo M., scarecrow painter of deluxe bodies,
whose ghost he'll one day grow up to play.
Her pale hands cup her threadbare elbows
as she somnambulates the black-as-oil street,
glancing up once to a high window
where she'll follow hope
right through the winter glass.

Shawnee Town).  She was born high in the Cascades in 1927; in her teens
was the recipient of a generous Lnham Foundation College Scholarship.
She came to poetry late, past sixty.

Actually Tagore was the first non-European to win the literature award. If memory serves me right. Quite a surprise choice that year. No one would have read his work but for Yeats' strong recommendation. The stage was all set for Thomas Hardy that year.

I would add that to most of the American media it wasn't even worthwhile =
investigating who Meuller is and why she won the prize. However, even =
when Americans win a Nobel, it's hardly covered, as it has no =
entertainment value. I think it has more to do with ignorance than =
jingoism.
As for not many American writers getting a Nobel in literature, we =
should be more concerned with our high rate of illiteracy than with who =
wins what literary prize.

It's only slippery if we get into self-satisfying automatic look at
me I'm not a racist lingo.
I've had talks with my friend Chenjerai Hove about this, and I love
his books,
but I know that he is not (yet) Nobel material. I am very very happy
that we have this wonderful and inventive
Shona writer. He won the Noma with his first novel, and stands tall
against the regime in his home country.
He's a great man and a terrific writer.
But give him time.

As to Chemists and so on. It takes a great heap of money, a big
university with facilities
and the wherewithall to entice geniuses to work there to even begin
to qualify for the kind of
event that brings Nobel attention. It's less likely to happen in Mali
than in California.
It's maybe sad if you look at it one way,
but who cares if you look another. There are things happening in Mali
that you wont be lucky enough to find
in Berkeley.

Folks:

There have been so manymanymanymany definitions of visual poetry; it's
tedious to cover covered ground. But today I'll go with this line from
Michael Gizzi's New Depths of Deadpan: "If the eye were a tongue"
(Oscillations in the Ether, p. 37).

For voluminous writing on visual poetry, you've got to visit Geof Huth's
blog: http://dbqp.blogspot.com/

You would be remiss if you didn't also visit Light & Dust:
http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/lighthom.htm

Join the Spidertangle (visual poets from around the globe) discussion group:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/spidertangle/

Watch for a major anthology of vispo in 2010!

Best, Crag Hill

Dear Allan,

indeed an interesting point. Hence also the introduction of Magritte in =
this
historical part together with the Dadaists and the Cobra movement. But
indeed perhaps the question and research about and towards contemporary
artists needs to be included in a way.

The border between language of poetry and the images of the artist is
something that is for me one of the reasons to start this bachelor paper
topic.

Hoping to have more discussions and thank you for your contribution.

Hope to write you soon again,

So, while we have poets who start with text and move towards concrete

things like glyphs and ascemic writing.

Subject: Re: Visual Poetry

Dear Philip,

I've been following the discussion a bit about visual and concrete =
poetry.
I sometimes work in that medium-not because there is something special =
about
visual poetry that attracts me but rather because of my theoretical
interests, or perhaps my methodological ones.  I happened upon visual =
poetry
(making it), very young, before I knew there were other people doing
anything like it besides Apollinaire and Oulipo and it happened rather =
out
of a motivation towards expression (or towards undoing expression) than
towards an aesthetic elan so to speak.

I can't speak for all visual poets, but I do think something that is
sometimes shared among visual poets is the interest to undo or redo =
language
and the way it expresses.  Language-in traditional linguistics and
philosophy, and even in literature-is often seen has having a kind of
"top-side" and "underside" or an "inside" and an "outside" or "form" and
"content" or what have you.    This can be theorized in many ways (and =
with
many different kinds of vocabulary over the years) but I suppose the way =
I
usually think about it (you're probably familiar with these ideas and I =
hope
I'm not insulting you by reiterating them) is that you have the word or =
the
phrase or the letter or whatever "unit" of language you're working with
(sometimes visual poets work with uncommon "units" too, or non-units, =
ha)
and then you have whatever it refers to.  And so language is split.  A =
part
of it is tangible and a part of it is not:  a part of it present, and a =
part
absent.   Saussure would call this signifier and signified, but when it
comes to poetry that terminology I believe is severely limited =
(especially
as far as visual poetry is concerned).  I also think this idea is often
present in the study of "poetics" whatever that is.

I think visual poetry often expresses an interest in making poetry with =
the
materiality of language, both or sometimes as a way of moving the medium =
of
language closer to something material, like paint, or clay, but also
sometimes as a way of unveiling or experimenting with the ways that
"expression" and "material" may be conceived as happening in the same
gesture, and in a way enact very literally an undoing of this dichotomy
within language that is more than a little problematic and probably is =
not a
very accurate way of understanding language scientifically (among other
things).  And experimenting with language in other ways too of course.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is that I started doing visual poetry =
not
only as a way of making new poetry but also as a way of understanding
language in a new way, and this may be something common with other =
visual
poets (although perhaps not all).

Feel free to email me if you want to talk more about this:
lilyrobertfoley@graffiti.net.  I am at University of Paris 8 doing a
doctorate in literature on Beckett, Bolano and Derrida, so it could be
interesting to be in contact.

Thanks,

Lily

Hello Joel-

I concur especially because I am an educator. It is alarming how many students in my classes are barely able to read and write. I wonder how they were allowed to progress through their elementary and high school grades without the proper intervention to address their reading and writing issues. I am aware that literarcy involves more than simply formal instruction, certainly culture has some influence. Nonetheless, your point is well taken and of course their are wonderful writers in this coutry who deserve the prize, but for me it is important that a woman received some recognition and especially one whose writing gives us all something important to consider about our collective humanity-the horrible as well as the sublime.

listservs, like this one, don't allow anything but plain text messages. no
pictures, no attachments, nothing but plain text. because once you allow
other stuff you open the door to the transmission of viruses among list
members.

here we have an example of a technological constraint creating an aesthetic
constraint. once again there is a hard separation between text and image.
and a hard separation between text and any other media, for that matter.

note i am not blaming list administrators for this. it is a technological
constraint.

listservs are a baby step from print, then, in the sense that they cannot
participate in the intermedial orgiastic crossbreeding of media that is
occuring in many online environments.

ress any unethical behavior on the part of our readers, judges, or editors;=
 2) to provide clear and specific contest guidelines defining conflict of i=
nterest for all parties involved; and 3) to make the mechanics of our selec=
tion process available to the public. This Code recognizes that different c=
ontest models produce different results, but that each model can be run eth=
ically. We have adopted this Code to reinforce our integrity and dedication=
 as a publishing community and to ensure that our contests contribute to a =
vibrant literary heritage."

the damn thing is a joke. if Obama can win the Nobel Peace prize, an illiterate pre-schooler may soon be nominated for the lit prize. perhaps i'm a bit cynical, but i seriously doupt that that's the case.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

For those of you who might be interested, my new book Reading as Belief:
Language Writing, Poetics, Faith, has just been published by Palgrave
Macmillan (although it is still listed as available for preorder, it is
actually out): http//us.macmillan.com/readingasbelief


Although most institutions are on a tight budget now, I hope those of you at
a university might consider asking your library to order the book. I've
included the information and jacket copy below. Thanks for your help.


Best,


Joel Bettridge



Author: Joel Bettridge

Title: Reading as Belief: Language Writing, Poetics, Faith

Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan


ISBN-10: 0230619428

ISBN-13: 978-0230619425


Reading as Belief advances the provocative idea that the disruptive
techniques of recent innovative poetry require readers to become believers,
occupying the same philosophical ground as the religious faithful. Pairing
the poets Charles Bernstein and Bruce Andrews with John Calvin and Jonathan
Edwards, and drawing on the work of diverse thinkers such as Wendy Brown,
Ludwig Wittgenstein, Walter Benjamin, Stanley Cavell, William James, and
Gilles Deleuze, this book demonstrates how belief, faith and
language-attuned critical inquiry share an epistemology, one concerned with
making meaning in the absence of certainty. Joel Bettridge argues that
recognizing such common ground helps overcome the cultural and philosophical
impasse following the collapse of modernity's central narratives about
language and liberal subjectivity.

=46rom remnants of my inglorious past, the absence of authorial intention=

seems to be one of the tenets of deconstruction I recall. In the present,=

the dialogues of authorial intention & presence/absence of the author=
 have
recently been unavoidable, or so it seems. I am certainly drawn to the
dialogue.=20

Here is where (I think, but help) the position(s) differ from my own. The=
re
is an (inescapable) authorial intention, because we are human, we think.
Whether we think with "minds," "souls," hands, or keyboards, some
construction forms, and this involves choice. Even co-opting other source=
s,
the action appears to require a human to which consciousness can be
attributed, or at least some motivation.

However, readers have their own, other intention that may (really,
necessarily does) differ from the author's. I don't mind keeping the term=
,
author. Although the author has exactly zero more priority than any other=

reader, once the work has occurred, been produced, is viewable/communicab=
le.
Readings, just as much as the work, are a construction that exist and can=
 be
judged, pondered, debated, enjoyed, employed. In fact, artists can
occasionally be counted on to be unreliable as a source. The reading real=
ly
stands or falls (on its own). It has its own intentions.=20

Any interest in discussing? These thoughts have been (de)forming and find=
ing
their way into my cranium. I appreciate any aid in exploding or tweaking.=

fuck it, i'll reply to my previous post. Mueller, for all i know, was an excellent choice. Margaret Atwood has enough prizes. As far as the noble committee looking beyond Europe, who can really tell. They made an excellent decision when they choose W Soyinka for the prize, when they finally reconized a resident of an African nation that wasn't of European ancestery. But when they give the Goddamn peace prize to a head of State, or to anyone who has the ear of the State (Kissinger), their repeating the dopey mistakes they should have learned to avoid. Eventually, they'll give the prize for peace to a pro wrestler who assumes the lotus postition when he enters the ring. I almost wonder if there's a point to giving a nobel for literature in a post literate world.

the damn thing is a joke. if Obama can win the Nobel Peace prize, an illiterate pre-schooler may soon be nominated for the lit prize. perhaps i'm a bit cynical, but i seriously doupt that that's the case.

A couple of years ago Geoffrey Gatza was in Buffalo, attending a conference
devoted to the work of Charles Olson, when he had a chance to talk with poe=
t
Anne Waldman. Gatza, who launched the online journal BlazeVOX in 2000, and
four years later, the small press BlazeVOX Books <http://blazevox.org/>  in
Buffalo, was lamenting the fact that the press wasn't attracting more women
writers. By that point, BlazeVOX Books had published about thirty
titles=8Bonly three of which were written by women. "Even though that include=
d
two books nominated for Lambda Literary Awards, I wanted to be a more
responsible editor," Gatza says. "So Anne offered the wonderful advice to
place a note [on the Web site] to let women know in advance that their
voices are appreciated." Evidently it worked. Among the press's new and
forthcoming books are titles by Marcia Roberts, Amy King, Celia Gilbert,
Sarah Sarai, Florine Melnyk, Jessica Baron, Sally Ashton, Elizabeth
Hatmaker, and others. BlazeVOX Books is currently accepting submissions of
poetry and fiction; guidelines are available on the Web site.

I may only be quoted if the quotes are attributed to Shakespeare instead of
me. But seriously, if PZ wants to make some money from dear ol' dad's
literary leavings, as he proclaims he does, he should do less to discourage
scholarship.

Hi Alan,that is interesting information. One wouldn't expect that from
abstract expressionists I think, although some of later Dada and also
Cobra-work can also be put within this framework, come to think of it.
There is one of the Belgian Neo-Symbolists who makes his paintings like a
plotter. He seems to write line after line a sort of non-existing language
and builds his paintings like that. I'm very bad at names, I need to get
back to you with his name later, but those are also boundary spaces within
my study that I need to define.
I think this idea to write a definition and a history of Visual Poetry will
be a bigger assignment than this bachelorpaper, I'm affraid (or not).

I'm also mostly interested in the boundaries of different art forms and to
see how one has an influence on the other or how they evolve both into
something new.
Thanks again for the useful information and I will get back on this and
other topics later.

Kind regards,

Philip

A couple of years ago Geoffrey Gatza was in Buffalo, attending a conference
devoted to the work of Charles Olson, when he had a chance to talk with poe=
t
Anne Waldman. Gatza, who launched the online journal BlazeVOX in 2000, and
four years later, the small press BlazeVOX Books <http://blazevox.org/>=C2=
=A0 in
Buffalo, was lamenting the fact that the press wasn't attracting more women
writers. By that point, BlazeVOX Books had published about thirty
titles=E2=80=B9only three of which were written by women. "Even though that=
 included
two books nominated for Lambda Literary Awards, I wanted to be a more
responsible editor," Gatza says. "So Anne offered the wonderful advice to
place a note [on the Web site] to let women know in advance that their
voices are appreciated." Evidently it worked. Among the press's new and
forthcoming books are titles by Marcia Roberts, Amy King, Celia Gilbert,
Sarah Sarai, Florine Melnyk, Jessica Baron, Sally Ashton, Elizabeth
Hatmaker, and others. BlazeVOX Books is currently accepting submissions of
poetry and fiction; guidelines are available on the Web site.

Did you mean Andrzej Wajda?
He did receive a honorary Oscar for lifetime achievements in 2000/2001.


Sorry to say this - To the educated art-cinema student, however, the Oscars have hardly meant anything meaningful. The whole foundation of the Academy's appreciation and understanding of cinema is errored.

Steve (Poet in Hell--I am also a poet in hell)--
This was refreshing to read. Thought I'd paste below. (from Writer's Alman=
ac)
Bobbi
=20
On this day in 1964, Jean-Paul Sartre (books by this author) declined the=
 Nobel Prize in literature. He was the first person in history to voluntar=
ily and unrelentingly refuse a Nobel Prize.=20
=20
Sartre had announced that he did not wish to receive the prize. When he le=
arned that he was being seriously considered, he wrote to the Nobel Instit=
ute asking that his name be removed from the list of candidates, saying th=
at he wouldn't accept the prize if it were given to him. But the Swedish=
 Academy had decided, and they gave him the prize anyway, noting in their=
 citation: "The fact that he has declined this distinction does not in the=
 least modify the validity of the award." Later, a Swedish Academy spokesm=
an said that even if he didn't collect the money, Sartre would be a Nobel=
 laureate, and that "the academy is guided not by a possible winner's wish=
es but by the decision of its members."=20
=20
Sartre had not wanted to cause a scandal by declining the prize, nor did=
 he want to offend the Swedish Academy, which had chosen him. After it was=
 awarded, he prepared a statement noting that he always turned down "offic=
ial distinctions." It was his belief, he said, that "a writer must refuse=
 to allow himself to be transformed into an institution, even if it takes=
 place in the most honorable form." He said that it wasn't fair to the rea=
der if he carried the authority of an institution along with his name. He=
 pointed out, "It is not the same thing if I sign Jean-Paul Sartre or if=
 I sign Jean-Paul Sartre, Noble Prize winner." Sartre had previously turne=
d down his home country's highest accolade, the French Legion of Honor, an=
d he'd also declined a tenured teaching position at the prestigious Coll=
=C3=A8ge de France. The Nobel Prize came with a large chunk of money (it=
 was $53,000 in 1964; today it's about one million dollars), which Sartre=
 =E2=80=94 who was not at all rich =E2=80=94 had to forgo when he declined=
 the prize.=20
=20
Sartre said, "If literature isn't everything, it's not worth a single hour=
 of someone's trouble."=20

Johanna;

I would add that to most of the American media it wasn't even worthwhile=
 =3D
investigating who Meuller is and why she won the prize. However, even =3D
when Americans win a Nobel, it's hardly covered, as it has no =3D

jingoism.
As for not many American writers getting a Nobel in literature, we =3D

Readers for the evening, introduced by Jessie Lendennie, will be Celia
de Fr=E9ine, Seamus Cashman, Nessa O=92Mahony, Maurice Harmon, Joan

the world of contemporary poetry.  I wanted an international
perspective so the contributors come from Ireland, Canada, Africa,

I think that this may be true, but are we sure it is true?

Is some of the bitterness coming from his having been in an academic
environment?

Is some of it because literary types might not know as much about
getting permissions for musical performance -- not know about this as
much as musicians?

Oh, yes, Louis Zukofsky (who is not an ass) quoted hundreds of other writers
in Bottom on Shakespeare. While it is true that these works were generally
no longer under copyright protection, it does indicate how far Paul
Zukofsky's spirit is from the source.

Hoping to probe the wisdom of the group...

I'm looking for a Ted Berrigan poem that I remember only vaguely (and
indeed, may be misremembering). But as I recall, it's a piece in a
similar style to his "10 Things I Do Every Day," but in this case it's
a list of things that are better/worse than poetry. May possibly also
be a section of a longer poem.

Ring any bells for anyone?

Thanks in advance.

Best,
Brian Cassidy

Dear List,

Scholars like Mark Scroggins or Stephen Fredman can better speak to Paul
Zukofsky=B9s seriousness in controlling his father=B9s literary estate than I,
but just from my knowledge of the history of his attitude towards using LZ=B9=
s
material, this letter on Z-site
<http://www.z-site.net/copyright-notice-by-pz/> is probably legit.

In the interest of Fair Use and academic freedom, however, I urge all
scholars and writers interested in working on Louis Zukofsky to defy his
son=B9s fatwa, as a matter of principle, while remaining within the bounds of
Fair Use.  Despite his threats, he can=B9t sue everybody and probably wouldn=B9=
t
win even if he did.

Peering Through Perfect Dark: New Poems by Susan Maurer

In PERFECT DARK (ungovernable press=2C 2009)=2C a new collection of poems S=
usan Maurer=2C the urban dilemma that is New York is told in fine style=2C =
offering up poem after poem with the kind of duality that satisfies and tan=
talizes readers. There's fine understated humor in many of the poems=2C whi=
ch softens the otherwise urbane voice -- one part wary and another part ear=
nestly yearning. It is this combination of vulnerability of the heart and t=
oughness of spirit that results in a compelling volume with fabulous range.=
=20

Some of Maurer=92s poems are ineluctably of the moment=2C seeming to have b=
een traced in a foggy train window and glimpsed in passing as we hurry by. =
Like BLUE CHALK LINE=2C at once suggestive of the emotive moment and dismis=
sive of it:=20

"He wrote on the brick wall in blue chalk
'I know who wrote this.'
Well I know who wrote this and
you know who's reading this
and that takes care of that."

In the poem WITH THE UNBEARABLES=2C by contrast=2C we are rushed along pell=
-mell with the high intensity crowd -- stretching our legs and striding ene=
rgetically=2C Frank O'Hara style=2C through the New York City streets.

"I notice I am running and the red dirt hits my Reeboks
Up or down=2C I'm baffled=2C go for up
I stumble to the crosswalk=2C see no clumps of people=2C ask
The first man sitting and the man who's sitting next to him
Tells me it's on further and yes=2C they do want readers"

There is a nuanced balance going on here between eagerness to experience th=
e world and desire to maintain crowd control. We=92re offered up a kind of =
innocence in the face of it all: "She made this cap/unafraid of the city's =
lingering threat=2C/was not troubled by thoughts of mutability=2C/of how th=
is ephemeral thing would fare 5 years from now" writes Maurer in CORONA.=20

There is also a wry kind of cynicism=2C which only partly masks the underly=
ing passion of the speaker=2C as in this couplet which concludes JARDIN CRE=
PUSCLE: "The death penalty comes back on Monday/I guess I'll wear black". O=
r in the opening lines from TO PAUL CLAUDEL BEFORE I FOUND OUT HE WAS AN AN=
TI-SEMITE AND TURNED IN THE PLANE TICKET.

"Claudel=2C Claudel=2C Paul=2C Paul=2C
cent phrases pour l'eventails.
You have cured me of the sea
but fanned from a cinder to a torrid blaze
my love for you.
I'm saying
this book is S
O beau ti
ful=2C I'm afraid it
might fly away.
And you=2C Paul=2C I love you for your poetry.
But I hope your teeth aren't bad."

True to their urbane nature=2C Maurer's characters are equally unafraid to =
cut off a potential moment of intimacy in a New York minute.

It is this tentative place she defines -- between the fully realized human =
being living just below the surface of the urban defensive shell -- which m=
akes Susan Maurer's poems so poignant and winning. Time and time again we a=
re offered characters torn between the desire for human connection and puzz=
lement over how to remain safe while achieving it -- perfectly enunciated i=
n the anecdotal CALLING BILL KUSHNER=2C one of her strongest poems from the=
 collection=2C=20

"And so we collaborated.
He did one line and I did another.
I wanted to look down his throat
to see where some of them came from.
I mean how'd he come up with them?
And he was mad at me sometimes
'cause he didn't think of some lines I did.
I was honored.
It was so intimate I wasn't sure we should be doing this."

One almost wants to cry out with the same perplexity: 'yes=2C you SHOULD be=
 doing this=2C Sue =96 no=2C no=2C you should NOT be!'

The ability to enunciate the dilemma of possessing a human heart in the tre=
acherous urban environment is one of the hallmarks of New York poetry -- an=
d in PERFECT DARK=2C Sue Maurer's got it in spades. There are vignettes and=
 anecdotes of experiences from Mozambique to Tallahassee=2C as befits a glo=
be-trotting Manhattanite. But whether it's at home or abroad=2C we are conf=
ronted with experiences and environs that both entice us and warn us away. =
PERFECT DARK is a world where a back yard is a 'concentration camp for drun=
ks=2C' people with Walkmen in their ears 'deaf to their own drama=2C' and s=
ome kind of 'Guantanamo on the Hudson.' Even the butterflies become 'colors=
/fraught with wings.'

The whole question of selfhood in the tumult of stimuli can lead to a viole=
nt clipped and yet captivating directness=2C as in DREAM ADDICT

"I've been having to look at a
number of faces that will
no longer look at me.
Ocatillo living fence=2C what the blue turtles like.
I can smell snow=2C
the brilliance of what is
left unsaid.
You hope the clown distracts the bull.
Where's the who. There's no who.
Horse of a different color. Same
fucking ride.
Glass beast. Mud garden. Ecstatic devouring.
My body is a foreign country."

If in the end it is about survival=2C Maurer poses for her readers a profou=
nd question -- what it is that is worth surviving for. Throughout PERFECT D=
ARK=2C we are reminded that there is beauty yet to be found within people a=
nd things=2C if we can just safely find our way through-- something inside =
that continues to offer enthrallment=2C and remains worth fighting for. "Th=
ey are not the correct colors/it's o.k. to admire like/taupe and beige. The=
se are Day-Gloes=2C/gawked at=2C cheap=2C carnival=2C/ what one doesn't lik=
e" she writes=2C in ZINC: FRANKLIN AND OGDENBERG NJ.=20

Yet rocks=2C she reminds us=2C "have secret/lives=2C fluoresce=2C have/doub=
le selves=2C turn from ordinary stone/to Day-Glo slash=2C or hot coal orang=
e" and in the end=2C we want like the author to succumb to their beauty:

"I gawk. I love them=2C
in the same category of miracle as
eggs which stand on end at equinox."

well, these earlier, withdrawn (too very grey?) prints, now
seem pretty nice, so I've tacked them onto about the year
2027... but honestly they'd makea great photo exhibit now:
4x6 prints in bent-acrylic frames on similarshelves ... but
I know this will not be permitted;  not in 30+ yearsso
whynow... so if you like this work and have some better
capacity at-hand... do let me know!  and if you buy this
digital book I'll include a free digital subscription to the
ongoing 12hr-project!  /:b

Exquisite: A Series of Corpses
Interactive Text/Visual Art Series Launches on Halloween Eve
CIMM Fest to also Exhibit Films, Music
All on Fri., Oct. 30, 7 =AD 11 p.m.

Consider it Chicago=B9s largest Halloween party for visual artists, poets, an=
d
writers.

Plastique Press and the Near Northwest Arts Council present a new
interactive poetry/visual art series - Exquisite: A Series of Corpses. Poet=
s
and writers will join artists on stage with a live model, drawing materials=
,
and typewriters. Poets and writers are asked to create new works, hand or
typewritten, based on the model, the art, the event, the people. Artists ar=
e
asked to draw about the same, including the written works. The result will
be a sort of immediate broadside. Sound and video artists are also invited
to come and create new works based on the event.

This event follows in the history of exquisite corpse parlor games.
Exquisite corpse is a method by which a collection of words or images is
collectively assembled by a group of people. Each collaborator adds to a
composition in sequence, either by following a rule or by being allowed to
see the end of what the previous person contributed. Exquisite takes place
at the Near Northwest Arts Council at St. Paul=B9s Cultural Center where the
exhibition Binary: A Pairing of Opposite States is currently on view. This
event is an extension of the Wetware Render Machine drawing performance tha=
t
happened there on Fri., Oct. 9 to great fanfare and with beautiful results.

Plastique Press will then publish an enhanced eBook of the works produced
that night, with each poet, writer, and artist being credited as an author.
Sound, text, visual art, and video will become part of the final book.

Works produced during Exquisite will be hung in the exhibition space throug=
h
Nov. 7, 2009. The eBook will be released in early 2010.

CIMMFest will also present a series of short films during the event. There
will be music as well.

damn, the light of inspiration has blinded me with the following insight: each year, 2 nobels should be awarded. One, to a deserving recipient who's actually alive, and another to Joseph Conrad. Conrad's pessissismism (how many ssss in pessis...guess it's back to remedial speling class) was the only thing that could shut Bertrand Russell up. Russell was impressed enough by Conrad to name a son after him.

btw, George, do they give nobels to Canadians? I seemed to recall some Canadian winning one of the science awards.

As far as the noble committee looking beyond Europe, who can really tell. They made an excellent decision when they choose W Soyinka for the prize, when they finally reconized a resident of an African nation that wasn't of European ancestery. But when they give the Goddamn peace prize to a head of State, or to anyone who has the ear of the State (Kissinger), their repeating the dopey mistakes they should have learned to avoid. Eventually, they'll give the prize for peace to a pro wrestler who assumes the lotus postition when he enters the ring. I almost wonder if there's a point to giving a nobel for literature in a post literate world.

Catching up on this thread a bit too late perhaps...

anyway, the interesting thing is Paul Zukofsky's fatwa does not mention the
word "translation" anywhere...
is the assumption - translation projects always come thru proper channel? or
is it - who the hell can & will translate LZ ?

that makes me immune to the fatwa.....does it ?

Dear List,

Scholars like Mark Scroggins or Stephen Fredman can better speak to Paul
Zukofsky¹s seriousness in controlling his father¹s literary estate than I,
but just from my knowledge of the history of his attitude towards using LZ¹s
material, this letter on Z-site
<http://www.z-site.net/copyright-notice-by-pz/> is probably legit.

In the interest of Fair Use and academic freedom, however, I urge all
scholars and writers interested in working on Louis Zukofsky to defy his
son¹s fatwa, as a matter of principle, while remaining within the bounds of
Fair Use.  Despite his threats, he can¹t sue everybody and probably wouldn¹t
win even if he did.

Announcing:


*TENDENCIES: Poetics & Practice*

*Trish Salah, Robert Gl=FCck & Rachel Zolf*


This new series of talks by major poets, titled in honor of Eve Kosofsky
Sedgwick, will explore the intersection of contemporary poetic manifesto,
practice, queer theory and pedagogy. Too often today, statements on poetics
and their manifesto-like style have been moralistic or prescriptive
discourses. By contrast, this series will attempt a Kinsey-like survey of
actual poetic practice--what writers actually do, in the writers' own
words--in the process queering the manifesto, inventing new terms for
poetics discourse, and emphasizing queer writing and poetics.



The first event features talks by:

*Trish Salah, Robert Gl=FCck, & Rachel Zolf*

...followed by a discussion/Q&A session.



*on Thursday, October 29*

*at 6:30 PM*

*FREE*

* *

*at CUNY Graduate Center*

*(in the Skylight Room)*

*365 Fifth Avenue, NYC*



Born in Halifax, *Trish Salah* is a Montreal-based writer, activist and
teacher at Concordia and Bishop's Universities. Her first book of poetry,
Wanting in Arabic, was published in 2002 and her recent writing appears in
the journals Open Letter, EOAGH, No More Potlucks, Aufgabe, West Coast Line=
.
Her new manuscript, Lyric Sexology, is near completion.



*Robert Gl=FCck* is the author of nine books of poetry and fiction, includi=
ng
two novels, Margery Kempe and Jack the Modernist and a book of stories,
Denny Smith. Gluck edited, along with Camille Roy, Mary Berger and Gail
Scott, the anthology Biting The Error: Writers on Narrative. Gl=FCck was
Director of The Poetry Center at San Francisco State, Co-director of Small
Press Traffic, and Associate Editor at Lapis Press. His poetry and fiction
have been published in the New Directions Anthology, City Lights
Anthologies, Best New Gay Fiction 1988 and 1996, The Norton Anthology of
World Literature, Best American Erotica 1996 and 2005, and The Faber Book o=
f
Gay Short Fiction.



*Rachel Zolf*'s most recent book of poetry, Human Resources (Coach House,
2007), won the 2008 Trillium Book Award for Poetry and was shortlisted for =
a
Lambda Literary Award. Previous collections include Shoot and Weep (Nomados=
,
2008), from Human Resources (Belladonna, 2005) and Masque (Mercury, 2004).
Her poetry and essays have appeared in journals such as Xcp: Cross-Cultural
Poetics and Open Letter and in the anthologies Prismatic Publics: Innovativ=
e
Canadian Women's Poetry and Poetics (Coach House, 2009) and Shift & Switch:
New Canadian Poetry. She was the founding poetry editor of The Walrus
magazine. Neighbour Procedure will appear in the spring from Coach House
Books.

CREDIT is an 800 page, large format, full color, hardbound book, available
for $199.99 from Blanc Press <http://blancpress.com/> in Los Angeles--the
longest, most expensive book publishable through the online service,
lulu.com. Divided into two sections, Part A: Credit--26 parts (a-z) and Par=
t
2: Debit--10 parts (1-10), CREDIT is a highly revealing and emotional work
chronicling a personal tale of credit.

In late spring 2007 as an irrational exuberance and promise of financial
fortune hung in the air, mailboxes were filled with generous and gracefully
worded offers of credit. Just over two years later, in midsummer 2009, the
shape of the financial environment changed radically and mailboxes still
filled up with statements of credit. Something had to change, offer turned
to obligation.

Retailing for $199.99, CREDIT is a book the author himself lacks the cash o=
r
credit to buy.

Timmons' CREDIT:
Let=92s face it, only those who see the invisible can do the impossible.
However, miraculously, and right on cue, just short of a decade into the
21st century, Mathew Timmons has given us a momentous, lucid, and gripping
book that makes visible what used to be, exclusively, invisible, the wide
terrain of credit. Buy =93 CREDIT,=94 tell your friends to buy it, and take=

lessons to heart: Credit is expensive!... Credit is not cheap=85 Credit is

=97Harold Abramowitz

If you want to pay a penny for a thought Mathew Timmons has 19,999 of them,
but like Master Card suggests, Timmons keeps it simple. CREDIT is a work
ripped from both the headlines and the mailbox.

CREDIT by Mathew Timmons captures the entire postmodern economy under one
cover. Like an avalanche of fine print, CREDIT reveals absolutely everythin=
g
required to be disclosed by law. Timmons aestheticizes the angst of
indebtedness into a colorful durational novel, complete with a lifetime
supply of rate, fee, and grace period information, plus all the =93__ _ !lI=

=97Sianne Ngai

The output is a sprawling, modular form-letter with all the
personal/financial affirmation cut down through razorbladed
erasure-transcoding. CREDIT=92s procedure traces an unfollowable map from t=
he
macrodistortion of mass-market advertising onslaught to a subjective
microdistortion of noise stream granulation and reassembly. CREDIT is
problematic in terms of numbers, transaction, hardware and software. The
text=92s operation is ravenously lossy, feeding on filtering byproducts and
mistranslation; emphasis on information loss/breakage makes the text
self-genotoxic and it sprouts mutant poetry from attractive shapes and
corners. The text can be rotated. CREDIT is unreadable and CREDIT is a
vibrant autobiography and CREDIT is a rainbow dream.

Quite possibly the oldest system of exchange, credit is almost inseparable
from wealth. Credit is the laxative to the stubborn bulk of capital.
Similarly, how easy can form be separated from content? Or is content itsel=
f
a kind of para-form? Paraformaldehyde, even? Disinfectant indicating
content=92s historicity in its obliteration? Content is form not yet
recognized as such. Content is form on credit. And it is to Timmons=92 cred=
it
that he seems to be particularly susceptible to this confusion, bombarded a=
s
he seems to be with offers. And though credit and wealth may be
interchangeable to the point of identity, still Timmons is all the more
duped for believing so.

reproduction, but you=92re not getting anywhere near this thing.

It seems only natural that with this book I re-appropriate a blurb about
another book (Fiona Banner=92s The Nam):

Congratulations! You=92ve been preselected to apply for a copy of the new b=

by Mathew Timmons at a low introductory rate of just 199.99 and no annual
fee ever. Documenting the social and economic space defined by the writing
that falls between bulk mailing and fine print (full color and some of it
very fine indeed), CREDIT appropriates direct mail credit card solicitation=
s
and advertisements in order to explore the nature of disclosure in a series
of plays between display and censorship, see-thru windows and security
envelopes, financial promise and legal threat=97or simply, in Guy Debord=92=

terms, between monologue and true communication.
Testing the limits of publishing=97CREDIT is the largest and most expensive

Yeah, several science Nobels to Canadians,
and a Nobel Peace prize.
And if Saul Bellow hadn't skipped the country, a fiction one.

Subject:      350 poems about climate change
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

350 Poems is part of 350.org's international day of climate action that happened on October 24, 2009.

http://350poems.blogspot.com

On this site, 350 writers each contributed a poem responding to climate change (in a language of their choosing) in the days/hours leading up to October 24th. As an additional constraint--mirroring the real political obstacles and shortage of time we face--each poem had to be 3.5 lines in length.

Why 350? Because that is the agreed upon safe upper limit for CO2 in the atmosphere (in parts per million). We're currently at 390 and rising, close to what climate experts call "the point of no return." This is a critical moment: we and our political representatives must act quickly in the less than two months before this December's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.  Visit 350.org for other actions in your area (there are currently over 4000 actions in over 170 countries).

A lovely example of Louis Zukofsky's way with quotations is the playlet to =
be found in _Prepositons_ wherein a visitor comes and speaks with William a=
nd Catherine Blake. William Blake's utterances in the playlet are all qoute=
s from the man's work. At one point WB pronounces from one of his Notebook =
Poems--

I have mental joys and mental health,
Mental friends and mental wealth

It's clear what Blake means in the notebook poem--My mind to me a Kingdom i=
s (as an Elizabethan poet once wrote), whatever my outward condition--but i=
solated in the Zukofsky skit, the phrase "mental health" has that other (20=
th century, or when *was* the phrase first used for sanity?) signifigance, =
and challenges all the people who have ever called Blake "mad".   =20

Coretta set up the problem; she tightly controlled the estate until 1)
the sale to Stanford, 2) her death.  That's why one couldn't find his
stuff.

The relatively recent sales of archives and copyright do fuel a lot of
this, but some people argue that we are seeing the last round of these
sales.  Some of the reasons are that there are vast quantities of
electronic - format materials archivists aren't quite ready to deal
with (including sorting the wheat from the chaff), and another is that
there are certain items that used to be kept by writers that are no
longer kept by them.

Apologies, I had hoped for some time for a longer response, however that
may not be.

In Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, there is a discussion of
micro fascism where the fascist in you is not over there. While to some
this may appear a difficult and complex theory of subjectivity my
lesbian feminist philosophy lecturer, Marie Curnick, considered it
accessible to undergrads such as myself, and even if graduate students
travelled from Paris, UK and Canada to attend these seminars.

To look to a poetics of hate we need look no further then Aristotle and
Kant. This may come as some shock to those of the liberal arts academy,
but how often must it be said that Kant, following Aristotle's
categories with his precious correct use of the faculties, excludes
women, gays and those not said to have a white skin, from reason and as
such, immanent critique. It is right here, inside the writings of
Aristotle's poetics and Kant's aesthetics that the poetics of hate is to
be found.

Don't dare accuse me with your Kantian tribunal backed up by the ancient
ignorance of an Aristotle era long past a decent use by date.

I have found this article on the Australian gay surrealist painter,
James Gleeson from which this quote:

With some justification surrealism hasnâ€™t been thought of as offering a
very propitious milieu for anyone who did not subscribe to the ideology
of heterosexual love. The virulence of its leader in denouncing same-sex
sexuality is notorious, and has been assumed to stand for the movement
as a whole.

Perhaps, it can only happen in Australia?

with best wishes, Chris Jones.

PS, must cool memories two come into this? He said destroy, not
deconstruct.

Sorry for this but it has come to my attention that the James Gleeson
gay Australian surrealist URL seems to go nowhere. (Gee, even the world
wide web is homophobic and you think me an hysterical queen...)

Google this and you should find it... james gleesonâ€™s desiring

Hi,

The journal i edit, Eleven Eleven, publishes an online issue in the winter and a print issue in the summer.  One of the advantages of print is serendipity -- you read a piece by someone you know, turn the page and discover someone you don't.

I've noticed that most webjournals (including ours at elevenelevenjournal.com) don't work that way.  You click on someone you know, then you click back to the index page -- there's little to get you to click on someone unknown.

We'd like to change our interface to address that, and was wondering if there was any advice/examples/models of webjournals that are more serendipitous than the usual.

Many thanks,

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

sawbuck <http://sawbuckpoetry.blogspot.com> is set up so that the entry
point to the poetry is appended to a small snippet of the work inside, but
without the name of the poet attached.

also realpoetik, no tell motel, & a few others publish only one author at a
time, so that every reader is focused on whoever is the current featured
writer.

i have family from Nova Scotia. I remember the unfortunate lack of indoor plumbing when i was there 30 plus yrs ago. The most delicate matters of personal hygene were conducted in what was called an "Out/House." I was greatly saddened to note the lack of common household amenities our neighbors from the north had to endure. Correction: I was very young and  a complete asshole and probably gloated over the primitive living conditions. I suspect things have improved.

Saul Bellow, he dead.

Yeah, several science Nobels to Canadians,
and a Nobel Peace prize.
And if Saul Bellow hadn't skipped the country, a fiction one.

As far as the noble committee looking beyond Europe, who can really tell. They made an excellent decision when they choose W Soyinka for the prize, when they finally reconized a resident of an African nation that wasn't of European ancestery. But when they give the Goddamn peace prize to a head of State, or to anyone who has the ear of the State (Kissinger), their repeating the dopey mistakes they should have learned to avoid. Eventually, they'll give the prize for peace to a pro wrestler who assumes the lotus postition when he enters the ring. I almost wonder if there's a point to giving a nobel for literature in a post literate world.

Here is a possibly high risk (of lost readership) suggestion:
1. Do not disclose anybody's name on either their pieces or on the Contents=
 page. This will compel folks to look at content.
2. A=A0 la 'twitter' let your editors choose the most 'delicious' quote of =
lines from either prose piece or poem. Provide the option for a link to the=
 whole piece. (This would help eliminate the problem of readers who balk at=
 the idea of having to read a whole magazine).
3. Provide name and artist for any piece,=A0 only on request, one at a time=

Good luck, Hugh!=20

Hugh,

You hit the biggest problem with the web world and its logic. while it
appears to open us up to a wide wide world -and in some way it does- in a
deeper, pernicious way narrows it, potentially to the size of provincial
village.

Ciao,

Murat

Every academic journal I've dealt with is hypersensitive to
permission issues. Literary types might be unaware, but their editors
crack the whip.

When looking at web journals I always click on those names I know first, but I also always click on some I don't, as I want, of course, to come to know the work of new writers, too. I do think it would be fun, however, if you installed both "next" and "shuffle" buttons that would move the reader through the site more or less blindly. I'm trying to remember offhand whether and where I've seen this before on literary sites, but I'm blanking....

All best,

 Michael Tod Edgerton

Hugh,

The online journal, Toxic <toxipoetry.com> seems to have found a way around
the problem you describe with typical html poetry sites.  Their
flash/shockwave interface allows you to =B3flip=B2 through the journal, easily
checking out =B3what you don=B9t know.=B2  Check it out.

How about mixing/sprinkling poems by each author throughout one or more w=
eb
pages & having the links be positional. So, if Peacock has 5 poems in=
 Eleven
Eleven, poem 1 may be in between two authors and poem 2 may be in between=
 2
other authors, etc. The viewer would bump into the other poems when
scrolling...although this doesn't measure the clicks.

OR extra links embedded near the results, so if Davies is the initial cli=
ck,
place some extra links after those poems (to other poets). The text of th=
e
link could say anything. You could get very fancy & randomize the lin=
k.=20

Klee Flowers: http://vispo.com/dbcinema/klee

This is a series of 140 images made of pictures of paintings by Paul Klee.

I made the images in dbCinema, which is a graphic synthesizer and
langu(im)age processor I'm writing in Adobe Director, which is a 'multimedia
authoring' program sort of like Flash. In dbCinema, one creates 'brushes';
each brush is assigned a concept--you type the concept--and then dbCinema
does a google image search on the concept and retrieves images from the net
related to the concept; then dbCinema uses those images as 'paint'.

Hugh,

I edit a little zine called, The Bathroom. What I do is layout a PDF
that contains all the authors. I think Dusie Press also uses the same
model. http://bathroommagazine.wordpress.com

"We have unknown collaborators." -- Hannah Weiner

WILD ORCHIDS, a journal of affective and inspired forms in literary
criticism, is seeking submissions for its second volume, focused around
the life and writing of East Village poet Hannah Weiner.  Because
Weiner's own writing so electrifyingly opens itself onto different
voices, we feel her work lends itself particularly well to inventive
modes of critical contact that dispense with the pretense of "remove"
normal to academic discourse.  We do not have any one form in mind, but
would instead like the issue to chart how Weiner might be critically
"collaborated" with today, in ways that make the most sense within
contributors' own contemporary practices as poets, scholars, and fans.

All submissions should be sent to <wildorchids@endingthealphabet.org>,
by January 1st, 2010.  We suggest you have look at our first issue (on
Herman Melville) before contributing.  Copies remain at:

http://wildorchids.endingthealphabet.org

Hope to hear from you.

Robert Dewhurst & Sean Reynolds, eds.
