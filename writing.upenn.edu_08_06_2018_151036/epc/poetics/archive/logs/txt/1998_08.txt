What about "lexia"?

and to broaden the subject some, is anyone aware of work that uses Iser's
concepts of 'fictive' and 'imaginary' in relation to poetry as play.  Iser
does a fine job, but doesn't delve into poetry.

For Ron:  you're quite right re Lowell, Creeley, Whalen but don't forget
that it was very difficult to get out of being drafted and one had to
have all kinds of connections.  Lowell did spend time in jail, as
recorded in Life Studies.  I don't know about Whalen.  Creeley was
ofcourse 4F.  I had just meant that you couldn't just "decide" not to go
although long-time Quakers were pretty much exempt for religious
reasons.

Shift of topic:  There's an excellent piece on the visual element in
Olson's poetry in WORD & IMAGE by Christian Moraru who has just gone
from Indiana to teach at North Carolina-Greensboro.  "Topos/ typos /
tropos": visual strategies and the mapping of space in Charles Olson's
poetry."  Vol. 14, no. 3 (July-Sept 1998), 253ff.  Moraru shows how "the
political potential of Concrete discourse was downplayed if not utterly
ignored by Allen Ginsberg and his generation," and hence Olson's earlier
(and strong) connections to Concrete have largely been ignored.

And loved Douglas Oliver's comments about Anglo-American
relations--indeed on a major UPSWING.  THEIR respect for OUR poetry at
the London conference makes me think that it's about time that we pay
attention to the work of the many exciting poets there--Maggie
O'Sullivan, Denise Riley, Caroline Bergvall, Drew Milne, John Kinsella,
Miles Champion--many others.  The scene has really changed!

Sure, Henry, no question. But why such a gripe? There are many _more_
magazines filled to overflowing with gibberish written in complete
sentences and organized around "images." All "poetries" have their
learning poets or lifelong weak ones. A few become really good and
change everything. Yeats is one; Zukofsky is another. One can delight
in both.

This is pretty obvious, isn't it? Why be a bull, pawing the

Yes, of course. My point was that there are _all sorts_
of syntaxes available to poetry. It's a deep and wide realm of the
possible, and it's what makes poetry what it is. Painting is a bit
like this too. So is music. (Isn't that miraculous?) Heaven forbid
poetry become something like the refinement of a particular or
preferred idea of syntax (i.e. words arranged as "complete sentences"
as you say).

Well, this is getting boring, isn't it Henry? To bed.

As an A/academic, it's my duty to point out that we are, perhaps, mincing terms:
is the question: what does is mean to be _an_ "Academic"?  or what does
it mean to be "academic"?

My american Heritage pocket dict. says "scholarly to the point of triviality" --
I think I AM (in most circumstances in which I find myself) scholarly to the
point of triviality!  ("always a critic!")  I sort of like that!
I'm not supposed to be employable! -- what a relief!
But then that's just me with my lil ol' american
heritage.  Any OED-clad Academics out there?

They (a/g & mainstream) are academic -- I agree -- if by that you mean
"scholarly to the point of triviality"; but in terms of The Academy
in general (in the mainstream) the a/g is "less Academic" -- less
institutional -- the mainstream canon is Academic, the a/g merely
"academic"?

and on another note?:
How many times have you heard writers (we are talking about academic
poets after all) say that theory would mess them up?  That they don't
need theory?  I've sat with a roomful of MFA/PhD students who
absolutly refused to engage with Barthes because they felt
semiotics wasn't important to their writing -- and yet they
consistently employed patently Academic critical methodologies.
Which is *more* Academic?

I'm dreading the conversation even as i'm engaging in it.  It has
been played on this list before and I wonder if the question I ask in
a previous post can't take it to another place?

thought that last "academic" should read "Academic"

Very grateful to Mark Prejsnar for correcting and Bob Archambeau for adding to
my remarks about the Ric Caddel, Peter Quartermain anthology of the "Other"
British poetry.  In my original draft of the message, I called "Other" the
first full anthology of British experimental writing to be published in the US
for decades. On checking, I was surprised I'd left out the word "full" during
self-editing.

     I gladly remember the important Potes and Poets Floating Capital 1991
collection, pioneering at the time. The fine New American Writing selection of
26 new British poets was No. 8 & 9, Fall 1991, and many years before that New
Directions did a mini-anthology edited by Andrew Crozier.  No doubt there have
been other inklings which I've forgotten, but the gist of what I said stands:
it's seven years later, there isn't much about, not published in the US, and
"Other" should prove to be "fuller".

Bob Archambeau's plug for Billy Mills' book service very timely in these
circumstances.  One of the best British distributors of small press work is
Peter Riley, 27 Sturton Street, Cambridge CB1 2QG, England.  John Tranter is
also doing a good job across the Atlantic-Pacifix axes on the Jacket website.

   Another possibility for firming relations: Talisman House have broken the
new turf with the Jarnot/Schwartz/Stroffolino Anthology of Younger (American)
Poets.  Excellent start.  There's a good case for a US-British (or US-British-
Canadian-Australian) anthology of younger poets -- born after 1960, say -- one
day soon.  Then, along with "Other" we'd have a representative set of texts on
the market to encourage book buying from the specialist distributors on both
sides of the Atlantic, and perhaps the Pacific.  When I taught workshops on
the younger poetry in the US and Britain at Naropa this summer, the interest
from students was remarkable.

     I've been fiddling  myself with the idea of collecting up a set of young
poet texts on these lines for proposal to a publisher but have concluded,
sadly, that I have too many other projects on hand.  This may make my
suggestion sound weak -- can't be helped.  But I'd be glad to be in contact
with any person/ persons who did get enthused to offer what help I could.

Katy -- I think I figured out why your response bugged me
> I have never understood the claim that "avant-garde" poets are in

If you look at history, I think you'll understand the claim.
In writing a history of women in the small press I've looked into
the mimeo revolution -- to see what went on & specifically the
roles individual women played.  To be avant garde in the 50s-60s was
to be categorically anti-academic; Small press movements spawned the
work that became the New American Poetry were grassroots,
anti-establishment movments, providing an alternative forum --
journals such as The Floating Bear, Yugen,"C", Beatitude,
Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, Big Table, The
Black Mountain Review, Caterpillar, Open Space, Contact, The San
Francisco Review, 0 to 9, The World &c &c -- in NY, SF, Black Mt, and
Chicago.  Many editors fought obscenity charges (Diane DiPrima has an
amazing anecdote about taking on the FBI, LeRoi Jones single handedly
taking on the supreme court) that the academy as a
matter of course complied with.

For example, Academy pressure over obscenity charges wagered against
the _Chicago Review_ caused it's editors to go anti-establishment --
literally, the editors quit their academic editing posts and began
_Big Table_ so they could publish Burroughs and Ginsberg.  The U of C
had pressured them to stop publishing because a Chicago newspaper
journalist accused  the Chicago Review of publishing "filth" !!!

Until these presses and little magazines began, there were only "academic
quarterlies" to publish in.

Yes, Ginsberg and Burroughs are canonized, the a/g has all the fixins
on their plates too. Yes, both the the "a/g" (whatever that is) and
the mainstream are "in" the academy.  So I repeat my Q: what now?
What does this mean for the a/g, for innovative poetry, to "be"
"academic"?

 -- it's lonely on this list at 2 am!  It must be nearly lunchtime
for Douglas Oliver!!

To Doug Oliver's list of things to check out, if you do check out me and Sub
Voicive Poetry - and there is a distinction - then do also check out Miles

the series and he is *well *worth knowing as a poet... as a person too

For me, the chief virtue of Shoptaw's work is that he has made previously
inaccessible poems available to close reading without entirely normalizing
their strangeness.  His analyses of _The Tennis Court Oath_ in several
articles are, I think, unsurpassed.  Not too long ago however Mark Wallace
defended Steve Evans (against Henry Gould?) for Evan's somewhat oblique --
though, brilliant, apology -- of poetic innovation by arguing that close
readings are ephemeral stuff -- an attitude which, since I imagine it is
widespread, might explain why Shoptaw's techniques of close reading are
somewhat anomolous -- hence the apparent difficulty of naming similarly
oriented criticism -- though it strikes me that it is precisely new techniques
of "close reading" that the current situation most urgently requires).
Perhaps, in addition to Fred's question, someone might want to comment on the
dynamic between the criticism being done by practicing poets (& in the last 20
years there has been a renaissance of poet/critics unmatched since the period
of the New Criticism) & scholars such as Shoptaw, Perloff, Damon, Conte, etc.

i haven't been following this thread very closely, but want to chime in as
someone who is at the end of her first year "in" the academy: tenure-track
job and all that, and who was desperate to "get in"--

i make less than anyone else i know in academia: point here: just being in
doesn't mean you get paid well.  plus w/ all those student loans having
come due, i live hand to mouth--at a similar if not lower level as i did
as a grad student.

at my university everyone (even tenured faculty) is issued a one-year
contract.  we are, in effect, glorified adjuncts.   point here: being in
doesn't necessarily mean you don't always work with the nagging worry at
the back of yr mind that next year you may be looking for a job again.

> I'm tired of being an outsider.

this _feels_ better to me now, as in, i _do_ feel "inside" but this
feeling doesn't really do anything for me or my career.  i live and teach
in a samll, rural, isolated town/university--i'm never really sure just
what it is that i am "inside."  going to confs and such i do get to
introduce myself as dr. tangney--that is, i would if we did that kind of
thing, which as we all know we don't --so--what is this inside feeling
really worth?  i'm not that sure.

> I'm tired of no health insurance book/travel/conference perks.

i teach a 4/4, i am expected to give conf papers and publish and do
service.  i am given minimal travel support (i got better support from my
dep't as a grad student), and no release-time to write.  i had intended to
write all summer, but due to financial hardship i had to teach this summer
(again: i made more as a grad student for summer school courses than i did
this summer as a tenure-track faculty member).  our helath insurance is
terrible; i still haven't been able to afford the dentist.

> I'm tired of begging. I'm tired of insomnia.

see above.

> I'm tired of no furniture, eating poorly.

when i got this job i seriously considered not moving the couch i had
because it was so awful and old and beat up.  i'm very glad i did because
as it turns out i can't even afford to get it cleaned, let alone replace
it.


> I'm tired of the whole fucking thing.
> I'd join in a second.
> I'd join for free.

i'm tired of it, too.  i wonder almost every day if there's enough jesus
christ in me to keep at it.  i believe in it, i want it, i know we need
it, and i wish like hell i felt like i had enough strength and power to
fight like hell to preserve and improve it.  some days i do; many i don't.
the days i don't are because i'm exhausted from doing what "the system"
keeps me doing instead of what i know i should be doing--take for example
just the issue of college profs teaching a 4/4 load: this is crazy.  it
makes lousy teachers of us all.  but at the end of the day/week, i'm often
to freaking tired to fight about it.  it's classic, isn't it?  keep 'em so
wasted they won't complain--it's positively feudal.

i don't mean to be bitter: i am trying VERY HARD not to be bitter.  and i
was very naive before i got "in."  i thought i would have some secruity,
some respect, and i thought i'd be able to get my teeth fixed and buy the
kind of beer i really like.
it's just not that simple.  and it doesn't happen overnight.  and it takes
much more fight than i ever dreamed it would.
i'm not ready to give up, but let's be careful not to aggrandize "in".

best,
shaunanne

        To me, the term "academic poetry" feeds off that use of the word
"academic" to mean "nugatory," as in "oh, thats only of academic interest,"
or "that's academic" meaning "of no moment."

In this light, a lot of poetry written outside the academies is as
"academic" (to me) as a lot that is written from within academe.

Theres no sense drawing a line around the universities and saying
"everything within this circle is of no interest." Most of the challenging
and rigorous poetry being written today in north america is being written
by college professors. Some of these, its true, are only college professors
_because_ of their poetry (i.e., dont have advanced degrees; were hired to
teach only poetry anyway). But others followed the more common route to
their posts. I think of Michael Davidson, a phenomenon in that he teaches
fulltime at UCSD, publishes articles, gives papers, and has 2 scholarly
books out; raises two young kids, corresponds extensively, swims daily, and
is one of america's finest poets. Alson Neilsen of this List is a like
wonder (exempt the kids and the daily swim).Then there's that other
Dano-America, Cole Swensen, with a doctorate, teaches at Denver U, writes
marvelous poetry and does extensive translation from the French. Nothing
academic about them. David

Linda, the last planned issue of PJ never appeared--this was several years
ago.  It's now being put out--with some of the material of the originally
proposed issue as well as some newly solicited material, much of it by
"younger" writers.  In June Barrett said it would be out in July, so I
imagine it will be out soon.  There are others on this list who are also in
this issue and who are probably in closer contact with Barrett and Lyn than
I am this summer--who might have more details.

Please forgive me if I am repeating earlier conversation. I admit to being
away, stopping poetics mail, and not going completely through the archive
of the last ten days or so.

But a friend just put the July 16 New York Review of Books in my hand.
Therein, by some John Bayley, an article on new poetry books by Donald
Hall, Frederick Seidel, J.D. McClatchy, Mark Strand, and Edward Hirsch,
from which Bayley extracts such overall characterizations of poetry, and
contemporary poetry, as . . .

"Poets must often write to cheer themselves up, and in so doing the good
ones can cheer up their readers as well."

"Poetry works immediately . . . or it doesn't work at all . . . Its
function must be, as Mallarme said, to give a purer meaning to our tribal
language, and also a more concentrated one."

"A general impression . . .: how quietly but firmly civilized much American
poetry has lately been becoming. It is partly of course the influence of
the campus, but, more than that, it may reflect a general nostalgia for
civility and civilization as being in the end an inevitable source for
poetic culture. Poetic learning in America today is worn easily, seldom
irritatingly academic, but also not making apologies for any lack of vox
pop elementariness. What would the founding fathers of modernism, and those
who wanted with Carlos Williams a plain poetry for cats and dogs, think
about these developments? How would Walt Whitman respond? With surprise?
Dismay? No, I think he would have liked these poems."

This angers and befuddles me, as I try to imagine what constitutes this
"poetic culture" and what kind of "purer meaning" is given "to our tribal
language," by a poetry which is praised for being civilized, which seems to
mean the same thing as not being irritating, as it collaborates with a
general cultural nostalgia.

I have a hard time imagining Mallarme or Whitman or Carlos Williams
approving.

I know the NY Rev of Books is only being itself here, but it's still
disgusting.

Except that they teach in the "academy." I agree that there should be no

It is strange how the idea of the academy makes people so defensive...drawing
lines against those academic and those not...(ask anyone outside of the
scholarly argument what they think about this and they will tell you anyone
who is a professor is an academic...) who cares!  is it what others think of

The interesting question isn't who's academic, who's not, or what makes an
"academic," but rather what Linda asked: what's it MEAN that alternative
poetries & practioners are firmly "inside" now? What's the effect of two
generations of poets passing through Buffalo, or all the writers who have
graduated from the New College, Naropa, San Diego, Bard & Brown and who are
now writing, teaching & publishing? Certainly the terms of debate within the
universities has been altered. My sense is that it's basically a postive
force. We need it. Institutional tensions follow in the wake. Who will be
forgotten?

Regarding Erik Sweet's comment on the academic, the history of which
(David Bromige post) I haven't followed:

In Chicago in the 1980s, when the performance poetry scene was booming, I
suddenly found myself framed (by Marc Smith) as an academic because I
taught at Columbia College Chicago.  When reporters from The Smithsonian
and Wall Street Journal called to ask what I thought of the slam
phenomenon, I would talk at length about its history, in Chicago and
elsewhere, and make a claim for myself as "non-academic."  But the
reporters wanted soundbites, which I didn't know how to construct, and
concluded that since I taught at a college I must therefore be an
academic.  I said that the slams seemed to me (Baraka said so, too) a
relentless capitalization of the popularity of "voice"; that it
represented the triumph of mass-media-ready poetry at the expense of text;
and that it generally lacked the kind of political critique to be found in
Ginsberg, Baraka, Rothenberg, and Waldman, among others.  The reporters
would use my most negative statements to frame me as the disapproving
professor/bete noire needed to make the story dramatic.

But of course there are numerous "academic" poets, by which we mean those
who employ the received idiom, who do not teach.  Because there are
only 250 creative writing programs in the country, these poets are in
the majority.

Both language poetry and performance poetry have been assimilated to an
extent by academic and broader cultural interests.  Because we are a
culture that values indeterminacy, risk-taking (especially with capital),
the "new" is prized.  But most poets like to operate on safe ground.  They
wait until an idiom has general acceptance and then leap in.  It's the
second wave that often gets the most attention.  Pound to Eliot:  "I'll
break down the door, you take out all the swag."

It is possible to be avant-garde and also academic; to be mainstream and
also non-academic.

True or false:  (1) Bad art is central to the concept of pleasure;
(2)Transgression is always sentimental; (3) Disjuncture heals all wounds.

Yes.

Or as Notley asks (out of her awareness of writing as a woman) "what
are we leaving out now?

It might also be fruitful to read the academic ensconcement of the
a/g as somewhat inevitable, (Black Mountain for example)
a direct result of the mimeo revolution and the proliferation of
small press poetic materials -- inevitably archived for ("academic")
study.  (if you haven't already, you might want to see my
Poetics/Academics/Revolution post)

what emerges is a confluence rather than an influence -- studying
different sorts of poetries demands different
theoretical/essayistic apparatuses -- "changes" what it means
to be A/acadmic.

And so not to be apologists, not to "scurry from the margins"
but to SIEZE the STRUCTURE (the Academy) and WRENCH
OR BREAK its FRAMES
jeez this is like dealing with being a woman poet all over again

so Yes, the imporance of remembering can't be stressed enough -- An
interesting confluence in the increasing amount of women small
poet-editors and the increasing importance of contemporary production
by women -- poets like Hejinian, Scalapino, Harryman, Waldrop,
Fraser, Dahlen, DuPlessis, Notley, Waldman, Mayer &c&c  --
might be less known had they not endeavored to create the materials
(little magazines/books) that all of us now turn to in defining our
traditions.

shaunanne, eric, charles, alan, &c,
  first, thanks to shaunanne for your academic example.  it resonates.
it isn't so simple as being happy to be 'in' because this seems like
a good job, i don't think -- after a decade of university (a decade of
no salary to speak of) and tens of thousands in debt, it doesn't seem
that tremendous to be making what a good administrative assistant would
be making at any number of strong businesses i can think of.  so there's
that.
  more problematic for me is the much-talk-of corporatization of the
university.  that has made faculty (mainly of course younger,
non-star-class) less important in the university structure.  more
painfully (and as i've also seen discussed), it is making students feel
more like consumers, as if they needed more excuses to resent the
degree-conferring power of institutions.
  as for the effect of practising writers in the academy, i can't
generalize -- right now it seems their influence is scattered, though
presumably it exerts some centripetal force toward whatever we imagine
the academic center of america to be.  when i was an educational advisor
in yemen, i used to tell aspiring middle eastern students that there
were upwards of 2500 institutions of higher education in the states.
but back here it seems we're almost always talking only of conditions
and definitions in about 100 schools.
  i'm happy to be 'in,' then, but it's difficult, and not least because
of having to negotiate the very ideals -- ideals that are necessarily
compromised because institutions are institutionalizing -- that make
being 'in' seem so attractive from 'outside'.

Hoover, and to all:  I thought it obvious that to be all that is stated above
is not a one sided endeavor...the question of mainstream has always bothered
me.
In music, art, government the mainstream has always been defined as reaching
the masses or manipulated and argued through the public presses. Mainstream I
believe is a concept, an idea that is in flux.

There is as Hoover states, a mainstream of the non-academic or avante-garde,
i.e. I would say... Naropa etc..something that is pretty well known through
media via Ginsberg, Kerouac... and which holds to a tradition of avante-garde
or non-academic? poetical style.  Naropa is good, the more that know of
it...only the better things can be.
Academic as a "notion"  means so many things to so many people... is at core a
good force, it means scholarship, discussion..and whatever "frame" people want
to put around it (good, bad) it will always mean possibilty and growth to me,
whether it is T.S. Eliot's disciples or some language poetry influenced young
poet teaching...

Subject:      Two new books I've read
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Two new books appeared on my desk this week, both short little books and
very worth your while.  The first was "Addenda," by Susan M. Schultz, a
handsome little book from Joel Kuszai's estimable Meow Press.  Schultz read
the last part of "Addenda" at a reading here on Sunday in San Francisco;
it's sparked with inane quotations allegedly from supermodels, "Once I got
over my anger at my mother, I became adept at volleyball, and modelling,"
says Gabrielle Reece.  Schultz uses these promising materials to produce
her own meditations on excellence, generation roles, the look of the page
and poem, the extension of poetic technique into blocks of pure prose.

The other book is "Not Right Now," by Renee Gladman, from Second Story
Books, a Proliferation Imprint.  This book, promises editor Mary Burger, is
the first in a series of "New Narrativist" books of prose written by
poets--poets exploring prose as one might wander through a new continent.
I have long admired Gladman's work, and here in San Francisco we know her
as a fascinating poet, but until recently her reputation has been a local
one (though she appears in the Talisman anthology of "New (American)
Poets").  "Not Right Now" is a kind of reduction/recut of Kerouac's
"Subterraneans," glistening at its essence, asking the question, what would
happen if San Francisco's Mission District were a kind of sexual,
interracial beat bohemia, with a young, black, short, mustached Lesbian at
its center?  "The day I was no longer a transcriber, I decided to be a
weight historian.  To go out and find things as they lie and then write a
book about them."

Both these books will in time I guess be available at Small Press
Distribution, but Mary Burger who published "Not Right Now" is reachable
through e-mail at mburger@adobe.com.

I forgot to say how beautifully designed these books are, whatever happened
to the days when nine times out of ten the poetry you wanted to read was
bound in those execrable covers that made a cat wince.

Thanks everyone!

The recent disjunctive synthesizing dichotomy discourses here raise a couple of
questions for me:

    1. Is it not possible (nay, even desirable) to begin with disjunction and
move to synthesis?

    2. If there is disjunction in the world (e.g., WWI, WWII, WWWIII) is it
________ to not account for it in synthesizing?

    ______ a. foolishness
           b. cheerful
           c. pure of heart
           d. all of the above

I was even suspended for reading _Lolita in class, and I'm not sure
whether Osip in Russian would be classified as a follower of Yeats or
Pound, or someone who didn't care one way or the other.  It seems to
me that perhaps the Yeatspound split and the Anglo/American split/
reunion may be missing some other lits/langs?

I had to look up the comment of mine that triggered Chris'apparently
annoyed response "I do not grant Mark Weiss the authority I grant you in
this matter, since I am more suspicious of a male judging another male as
sexist." Here's the entirety of what I said: "This (the Yau) is shockingly
cliched." This was a gut reaction to the quality of the writing, not the
morality or politics. I have no idea where Yau stands on these matters or
how he gets along with his wife.

Some years ago I dated a woman named Laurie Lewin (her nom de plume--her
name de danse was Lolita) who had been a stripper until shortly before our
relationship. She wrote a pretty good insider's look at the world of
stripping (although the publisher insisted that what had been in its first
draft an autobiographical and theoretical discussion and a series of oral
histories be recast novelistically). Wish I could give a better
reference--it was from a major press and should be out there somewhere. She
speaks, I think, with some authority. Her motivations and those of the
other dancers were, as I remember, extremely complex.

It would be interesting, Chris, if you could do so non-combattively, to
hear an explanation of why you are suspicious of males judging males as
sexist. Are there other categories to be aware of? Or are you just
defending a friend's writing? I'd also like to know where you got your
authority-granting privileges--I could use some of those myself.

My public library has 3 copies of Susan Howe's _Articulations of Sound Forms in Time_ published by AWEDE (Box 376 Windsor, Vermont 05089) in an edition of 1000 copies (in 1987). But now I've just recently seen it is included in _Singularities_. I don't have both versions in front of me. . . so I may be off here, but . . .

This is a radical revision, isn't it? I  had a more difficult time with the version in _Singularities_ (which doesn't mean that this version of  Articulation of Sound Forms In Time  is necessarily better or worse).I suppose I have to undercut my presumptions about what's happening, really 're-read' it,  but  the 1987 version seems more lyrical to me and somehow more "accessible".

Since there is much recent discussion of Howe on the list, maybe some out there have  comments or opinions about the original vs. revision of this poem. I suppose I should buy _Singularities_ . I've been reading it in the bookstore.

Just curious. The Awede edition of AOSFIT mentioned above is the most intense experience of Howe (for me) so far. Although, a poem which appeared recently in _Conjunctions_ is an incredible poem , too.

And for those who want to pursue this thread, isn't the version of
_Bibliography of the King's Book_ included in _Nonconformist's Memorial_
different in some really significant ways from the paradigm press edition?
In this case, it seems something of a simplifying, rather than a making
more difficult.

Ah, here I am at our Parisian breakfast-time, cursing because the fusebox has
struck out at my computer, Alice is prowling around wildly thinking while I
use her strip plugs, and way over there Linda Russo is, at last, abed.

Sweet dreams of Anglo-American literary relations, Linda!

I was really glad to see Marjorie Perloff take up this important theme of
cross-Atlantic relationships picking up again.  On the academic-small presses
thread, I'll add that Britain hasn't suddenly awoken from some dark medieval
night: it may seem like that. The small press scene remained highly active
from the sixties to the nineties and the "Other" anthology will show, I think,
how the poets who kept active during the difficult eighties were writers of
particular mettle.

Lawrence Upton is right to mention the role of the young generations and Miles
Champion has made an early reputation, agreed.  If, as it appears from the
Introduction to "Other" his work is not to be represented there, he is not
alone among the younger writers, and his turn in the anthologies, it seems
clear, will come.  See my suggestion for a trans-Atlantic anthology of the
younger work.

Check out her collected early poems, _Frame Structures_, and compare to the
earlier versions: many revisions there too.  There is much in her work that
changes from version to version, which is wonderfully congruent to the
content of her poems.

issue #2 of =the germ= just came in the mail, and like #1 it is
a completely gorgeous book.  many fine things in it (yes i'm
in it too, but that's not the point of my praise). stunning cover art
and collage works inside by joyce lightbody, poems by bernadette mayer,
rod smith, ray dipalma, lisa isaacson, many others.  highly recommended,
not least to those who long for lovely bookness.
 it's great to see so many journals out -- let a thousand flowers bloom!

This is in response to Jacques Debrot's comments on criticism as well as
the intelligent review of Trevor Joyce's _Syzygy_ in The Irish Times. I'm
interested in what people think about close readings of poetry. How can it
be done, as Debrot says, "without entirely normalizing their strangeness."
What is a close reading that does not do violence by killing off all
possible readings except one? is not fleeting or superficial because it
simply resorts to the cliched response that there are a number of
interpretations and that interpretation is dependent upon the reader
completing the writing? wears theory like a skin, but does not use it as a
tool -- surgical, truth beam or otherwise? I suppose we all do close
readings of poems that call to us. The trick is how do we *write* about
these close readings. One way is to write another poem, paint a picture,
compose a song, but that is not the critical response usually meant by
close reading. So I ask everybody, what do they mean by close reading? or
what can it mean? How can they be accomplished?

Myself, I use what skills I have picked up from school (a B.A. in 1976)
and my own reading (and that would be a mixture of some New Critical with
the poststructural) and do as Barthes suggested: find a loose thread, pull
on it and follow where it leads. Knowing, of course, that violence and
superficiality will have their way with me, but trusting that the reader
of my close reading will feel the scars and see through the translucent
structural skins I have made.

cricketlingly,
Steven

I asked Susan Howe about the differences between the original "small press"
issues and the versions published in _Singularities_, to which she informed
me that because of spatial constraints dictated by Wesleyan UP, she had to
edit down/edit out material.

I would agree that the changes certainly create further difficulties by
lessoning the number of threads for the reader  to follow and consider.

All best,

I too just received my copy of germ.  It is mighty mighty fine.  The
beautifully funky cover.  The Joyce Lightbody work makes me want to fly to CA
and see the actual artifacts.   They look fantastic.  I've been reading all
the poetry the last two days and have been delighting in piece after piece

David,

I find myself taken aback by this bit of information.  However, your comments, when juxtaposed next to those by Mark Scroggins and Hugh Steinberg, line up for some very interesting considerations, which I don't know how to voice at this particular time. I'll be re-visiting her poems again soon with this shocking  bit of news in hand.

I guess for a poet who, as Peter Quartermain has written, "treads borders, boundaries, dividing lines, edges, invisible meeting points" or as Michael Palmer has written , "addresses questions of disappearance and recovery, identity and absence. . .by means of a radical reevaluation of ...the nature of the text in relation to time"  she has allowed her own work to disperse into these same 'meeting places', and I'm not sure what encounter is possible there. .    and ... well, I could make some other arguments at this point but they would be only "subtle" rather than convincing.

Does anybody want to argue the substance of what I said?  The substance
was that Yeats represents - yes, Jonathan, there are other poets out there
too - but Yeats represents a different approach to poetry in terms of
synthesis/disjunction.  Yeats is a premodernist AND a modernist: he writes
poems in complete sentences, he uses "old" techniques of stanzaic development,
etc.  Now everybody can hop in & say "oh well hey Pound was a synthesist too
blah blah"... but lest we forget, Pound wrote toward the end of the cantos,
" I cannot make it cohere"  and also "it coheres all right, even if my notes
do not" [or something close to that anyway] and left "IT ALL COHERES" for
his TRANSLATION of I believe a Euripides play...  - whereas I think Yeats'
attitude, reflected in his poetry, was that the lyric poem itself is a
synthesis, a coherence, of rhythm, syntax, image, meaning.  & my point is that
this is not a harebrained oddball out-of-date concept of poetry, but is
the mainstream concept of poetry.  If that automatically rules it out of
consideration by the poets & critics of today, I feel sorry for them.

Why should I join the other cheerleaders on this list?  Why not question
some of their assumptions? The fact is I think American poetry is at a sort
of dead end.  I know this sounds crabby & unpleasant to all the delightful
poets & readers on the list.  In the NY Times Bk review today there was another
"mainstream" overview of the poetry situation.  the author talked about the
East European poets, Milosz in particular, & how they provided a counter-

the US. Pinsky's book "Situation of Poetry" was cited again for its call for
clear speech & narrative poetry.  The whole counter-tradition, which this list
supports & represents, was again invisible.  Why?  Oh, because of the evil
capitalist market system & the establishment networks blah blah... nobody
wants to consider the notion that this counter-tradition might itself be
bankrupt, in part for the very reason I mentioned:  the tearing apart of
syntax for the sake of innovation; the use of isolated vocabulary as a kind
of aesthetic private property (eg. "language poetry" - take it out of the
dictionary & it's yours) as opposed to the concept of language as a
whole function of "public" communication.  I know the intent was to
critique another style of appropriation; but appropriation is appropriation
& academic enclaves are academic enclaves.

------------------------------


I'm not sure that this list is cheerleading over here on the counter-tradition sidelines, while the mainstreamers with their cheerleaders and supporters, are suiting up on the other side. It seems like it is . And maybe most of us 'take sides' from time to time for argument's sake ( ie.,Didn't Yeats say he believed poetry is elitist, and he would make no apologies for that?) but what kind of lens are we viewing this whole 'contest' through? I am bothered by these labels and the way certain cultural assumptions are passed on 'osmotically', and the buck stops here, as much as you seem to be, but is this really what is happening?

 David Lehmann in the newest edition of BEST AMERICAN POETRY 1999 (Guest Editor: John Hollander) does mention Charles Bernstein and the (quote) "lively" Electronic Poetry Center. So, now what happens? Is this forgotten because no one reads the forward? Or is there someone out there now who wants to learn about poetry, and doesn't let this remark stray to far from his/her concerns?

Is anyone going to read this snippet in the 'Foreward' or are they going to turn to the selection by Hollander with comments by the poets themselves in the contributor's notes? Probably the latter.

Lehman also mentions Peter Gizzi in his forward, but the rest of the volume seems to contain no one on " our side".

Surely some new readers will question the use of the appellation "Best" in regard to the poetry "selected" for it? Isn't this another example of 'cultural selection' to borrow Gary Taylor's use of the word? You know the argument: the so-called combatants of the Culture Wars seem to miss the point "that culture is not what was done but what is remembered." I guess that's what your point is Henry Gould(?). Is this why you say "let's question some of their assumptions."(meaning our 'side' as well ?)Amen to that. Taylor mentions somewhere in his book about how, in the 1950's, a taxi drove off with the only copy of completed typescript of the letters of John Donne, and so we are (still?) missing a complete edition of Donne's letters. Isn't that the fear you are expressing? That something is being deliberately lost and is irretrievable?

Your mentioning of the Pinsky & NY T BK Rv piece suggests that our cultural memory is being deliberately repressed, or for some reason these particular arbiters of our culture believe they have in their possession the missing piece or have now located the only extant 'complete edition' (of something). Or more precisely, they don't worry about the 'missing letters', because they feel that they can already fill in the blanks themselves. Kind of giving us a wink and a nod as if to assure us that our poetry is in good hands.

 However, I hope something else is occurring, as it were 'underground'. Something which I just read 15 minutes ago in Taylor's Cultural Selection :

"…this strategy of isolation never works. It is defeated by a linguistic paradox : when a memory is deliberately repressed, one part of the mind tells another: REMEMBER TO FORGET THIS! You can forget only if you keep remembering the order to forget, and if you keep the part of the mind giving the order from the part of the mind receiving the order. Every reiterated act of deliberate disconnection depends upon, indeed creates, another connection. Moreover, the repression will work only if the offending memory is systematically disconnected from the system to which it belongs."

Another illustration of this is a clipping I saved from USA TODAY (April 21,1998), page #8D. At the top of the page in bold black letters is the headline : WHITE HOUSE'S EPIC EVENING WITH POETS LAUREATE with three pictures and stories profiling Robert Haas, Robert Pinsky, and Rita Dove. Below these 3 stories and just above a section of classified ads is an obituary notice for Octavio Paz's passing on April 19 ('titled' "Mexican stateman Octavio Paz was the world's poet). It mentions that Paz was often asked if it mattered that so few read poetry these days. He replied, "Those who do are young people, women and dissidents of all kinds : philosophical, sexual, political. It has become an art on the margins of society. It is the other voice. It lives in the catacombs, but it won't disappear."


So now where is it not to forget?

This is very interesting Matt.....Especially since many folks perceive the
*academics* as the ones who tend to take a hard-nosed anti-intellectual
stance.  Now i strongly agree that a pretty shallow anti-intellectualism
is a prominent feature of U.S. life and cul'chah..

But, contrary to your equation of folks outside the ivory pinnicle, with
Anti-I:

Who strike you as more anti-I, more opposed to new perspectives and
challenging poetics, Jackson Mac Low or Helen Vendler?

In large part, in the "wars" (as someone has just called 'em) that have
raged since 1975 around experimental poetries, it is mostly the academics
who've championed neo-babbitism, the non-academics who've been focused on
the real issues...

Lee Christian sends a thoughtful response to my grouchy generalizations.
The broad-brush bashing is stupid & unfair on my part. The only reason
I'm on this list is that it seems alive, it seems like that catacomb
thing you quote Octavio Paz about that the NY Times Bk Rv crowd does
miss.  The dynamics are interesting.  Pinsky, Heaney, et al. look to
the eastern europeans (two of whom sadly died in the last week - M. Holub
and the famous Polish poet whose name I can't come up with at the
moment...) as a way out of the narcissism & pettiness of US poetry;
from their position on the heights that's all there is.  Meanwhile
in the catacombs of the "counter-tradition" a set of stylistic
paradigms are in place that set the poet firmly at one or two removes
from "prosaic communication".  The Yeats/Pound thing is not an attempt
to narrow the range; just a means of once again raising the possibility
that "innovative" poetry & experiment might be organized on a whole
different set of paradigms.  I'm not saying that's not already happening;
what do I know?  - Henry G.

Interesting point, Simon: since when did we say that surgeons should be -
er - boned up on the latest re the operations they perform? Vendler comes
to UK and pronounces on a dearth of decent UK poets since WWII, but let's
not press her to show any knowledge of the field, since she's a Great
Person anyway. Edna Longley pronounces the alternatives in Irish poetry
"confused", and again, she's an Expert on (selected) Irish Poetry, she
ought to know, let's not question.  Also, it's true that many Learned
Profs and Literary Pundits in the UK would concur with both these views
so, hey, let's go with the flow on this one, no point in paying for
expertise and not accepting it, even if the expertise is inadequate for
the subject matter upon which it pronounces.

I'm assuming a level of irony in your original post, and lumbering along
in a similar vein. But seriously, folks - assumptions of the
unimpeachability of academic niche have contributed significantly to the
sustained critical invisibility of a wide range of poetries in my part of
the world (and for all I know many others) and to deny linkage between the
voices of academic criticism and the supression mechanics of mainstream
literary publishing is simply naive. If only Vendler and Longley (to whose
bait I'm rising as Keith knew I would...) and the other canon-builders
would recognise Simon's succinctly-put truth that there are "thousands of
different tracks through the woods" they'd be less likely to come out with
ill-informed opinions which Keith Tuma relays to us, and perhaps even,
more - dare we say it - open to the possibilities which are before them.

The careers of the major non-mainstream poets of UK and Ireland are marked
by public ignorance and neglect. The story of Bunting's years of obscurity
in his own country now needs no further telling, other than to remind folk
of our long trackrecord of such neglect. Along with him come Jonathan
Griffin (his poems published in the States at his death, at a time when he
was practically unknown here) Brian Coffey and other "Elder Statesmen"
honoured more by omission than attention. Collected Poems of poets such as
Gael Turnbull and Roy Fisher have been dropped by their publishers.
Paladin, an imprint which briefly pushed innovative brits into mass
circulation, was taken over by Murdoch's News International, resulting in
the dumping of Harwood, Raworth, and substantial selections of Allen
Fisher, Bill Griffiths, Thomas A. Clark and Others. And behind them (in
the sense of not having even that moment of accessibility) generations of
writers as varied as Colin Simms, Ulli Freer, Geraldine Monk - all writers
with honourable careers in "fugitive editions", who've existed by
word-of-mouth (significant phrase for what is often a strongly oral
tradition), by personal contact, and by smallscale activity. Mainstream
publication and notice in the UK were and are simply closed to them, and
to follow their work - from the UK or the US - takes a degree of conscious
effort. (The teachers who would be interested in teaching them hadn't got
texts which were readily available, and there weren't texts available
because teachers weren't teaching it...)

I'm tired of having these decades of inventive and responsible work
ignored or swept under the carpet with one-liners from those who can't be
bothered. That's not responsible academic or critical practice, and it's
simply not good enough to allow it as a kind of license on the strength of
somebody's work in another part of the field. Certainly the UK and Irish
writers who Tuma mentions - and many more besides (the 55 featured in the
forthcoming Wesleyan anthology ed. Quartermain and Caddel are not the end
of the story, though they're certainly a start) - well, they deserve
better.

To paint the picture thus bleakly is, of course, to overlook the crucial
critical exceptions - such as Jim Mays for his support of "younger" Irish
poets (they're not so young anymore, but they're still "confused"
according to Ms. Longley), Edwin Morgan in Glasgow, and the late Eric
Mottram practically everywhere; and the stream of US academics from John
Matthias to Tuma, Romana Huk and others - thanks to y'all, lights in the
dark. For many of the British and Irish poets I'm talking about, the
possibility of open readers in the US has been a lifesaver over the years,
a feeling that we weren't alone and weren't as eccentric as our posh
neighbours proclaimed us. Thanks to anyone who'll help bring the range of
"britpo"  into the daylight and make it less possible for the Vendlers and
Longleys and the critical squirearchy of the UK to make their sweeping and
inaccurate statements from on high. Phew. Hrumph. Thankyou.

just a note -- I'm interested in your dating these wars as "since 1975,"
particularly as I remember a poet grad student at U-Wisconsin, but from
Texas, in the early '80's, who at the time it seemed was being groomed by
Wisc. poet Ron Wallace. When arguing with this poet about these very
experimental/academic issues, his take on it at the time was that these
wars had been fought quite a few years before, and the "experimentalists"
had lost, so why are we talking about these things any more?

Yes, talk about a failure to communicate . . .

but seriously -- any particular reason why 1975 sticks out to you as the
beginning of these raging wars?

Yup....As i hope everyone knows by now, the situation of academics has
been stomped on so hard, and without sufficient resistence, that they are
truly reaching a level of proletarianization....It ain't a figure of
speech.  (I hasten to add that the lack of sufficient resistence reflects
the state of class struggle overall, and isn't the fault especially of
folks in academe alone.  You might blame developments in the steel and
auto industries, in fact, for selling down the river the chance at a
strong working class decades ago..Without a true labor movement in society
as a whole any one sector is vulnerable)

A related point:  there are disturbing hints in a number of recent posts
that people are moving the discussion of "academics" into an
*essentialist* model:  as if the issue were that there's something
*wrong* with being an academic.  The only useful issue here is an
*empirical-sociological* one.  Is the site of innovative poetries still
outside academe, as it once was (during the NAP '50s and the Lang 70s, as
so well pointed out by Linda) or is it mostly inside (as avowed by Bob G's
notorious coinage "acadominent") or what?

I think the answer is, "or what."  That is, the situation is fairly
tangled.

I suppose, but that was hardly the context for what I wrote about public
perceptions of the academy today, and the material consequences of those
perceptions at the level of funding for public universities. Matt

        And, when I left graduate school in 1971 with my dissertation
on Charles Olson in hand, I believed that these issue had been fought
out during the previous decade, since the publication of the Allen anthology,
and that the experimentalists had  decisively _won_.

        And we had won, intellectually. At least one of the problems with
this victory was that the "institutions" remained firmly in the hands of the
traditionalists.  The Creative Writing Programs were almost exclusively
in the hands of Iowa Writer's Workshop types (who had 25 years of tenure
left),
as were the well-funded, university-sponsored magazines, the university press
poetry editorships, the prize-conferring committees, and the granting
institutions.
For a few years, when David Wilke was the head of the NEA lit division, it
looked
like that at least part of  that might change, but, alas! Reagan,etc. (Even
corporate
sponsorship is likely less treacherous than government sponsorship...).

Of course the war in question goes back to the end of WW 2, with a major
public battle fought over Howl when it first went public and again when it
was published.

Yes, at the time David Wilk left the NEA I had just started a press, and
had, directly through David's urging, applied for a first NEA press
editor's grant and received it -- at the time such things could even be
done without non-profit status for the press, if applying as an individual
editor. I remember David stated that if Reagan was elected, he would quit.
At the time that move seemed wise, perhaps even an important statement. But
in retrospect, I wish David had stayed there a while longer -- not that
things wouldn't have eventually changed, with advent of Reaganism, rise of
religious right, etc.

or further. I remember one older professor who, as late as the early
1980's, was claiming that Ezra Pound brought on the death of poetry.

~The fact is I think American poetry is at a sort of dead end.

I agree with you on this Henry & set the tone aside. It seems there is a
lack of poets investing their time in terms of knowledge and willingness
to share their understandings with others. Perhaps the absence of
investment is why I hear of so many writers who, after they go to
university to seek out a mentor, leave writing programs severely
disappointed. My favorite poets invest partly to protect the people
against fraudulent activity and consequent impoverishment, partly to
innocuate the people against cults and all forms of conditioning, and
partly to bring the advantages of the poetic enterprise to the people
who can most benefit from them.

Similarly, people who contribute to poets and publishing ventures help
to prevent things from getting worse on a sociological basis: they make
it impossible for things to ever be as biased again.

Be well

     intent was to critique another style of appropriation; but
     appropriation is appropriation & academic enclaves are academic
     enclaves.

     Henry, I'm trying to follow your argument and I'm wondering if you'd
     be willing to clarify what you mean by "...the intent was to critique
     another style of appropriation..." Who was doing the critiquing and
     what style of appropriation are you referring to? I think you've
     raised something important here and I want to be able to better
     understand what you're saying. Did you mean that Langpo was critiquing
     capitalist "appropriation" but only replaced it with another form of
     appropriation, aesthetic rather than economic? Or am I way off?

I wasn't quoting Pinsky to criticize him, rather to suggest that some of
the ideas in "Situation of Poetry" still make sense.
   There are a lot of ways to deal with the myopia of mainstream press
about poetry.  Most of them have been tried here on the list - jeremiads,
dismissals, conspiracy theories, histories of the culture wars...
   In the criticism of my posts lately I haven't heard anybody try to
refute specifically what I've been trying to say:  that "marginalized"
counter-traditions are responsible to some degree for their invisibility,
because the disjunctive traditions they espouse are difficulty- and
obscurity-generators.  I'm not saying this is bad, either.  I'm not
saying poetry has to be the fountainhead of public oratory.  I'm only
saying, Yeats had a different tradition which is not necessarily reactionary
and is not necessarily dead. - Henry Gould

Er, well, Charles, no as a matter of fact....no "particular" reason.

But the early gathering of the Lang clusters, would have been over the
previous 4 or 5 years.  ("This" began in 1971, right?) By 1975, the
infamous "L" designation (which has outlived its usefulness, and now
resides in the hands of curmudgeonly retro-ists like our Henry) had not
yet arisen; but it was fairly clear that various strains were around that
did not fit into the old mutiple New American paradigm of rebel poetries
(Black Mt., beat, NY, etc.)...Through the agency of This and other venues,
newer things had been appearing in print for long enuff to start a sense
of unfamiliar idioms emerging..

Maybe i was thinking of the fact that 1975 was the date of Watten's
wonderful book, Opera-Works, one of the first things i saw in that vein.

I think Langpo - hit me, real langpoets out there - was trying to
write against the appropriation of poetry by 70s MFA "self" factories,
and against the appropriation of literary space by "privacy capital" of
all kinds.  Their strategy was a drastic one: basically to dynamite the
rhetorical/communicative function, the authorial function, and so on by
letting "language" - individual words, non-sequiturs, broken syntax &
rhetoric - speak (often comically) for itself.  I'm suggesting this was
a kind of unwitting creation of a new kind of private property - sort of
prospecting the dictionary. - Henry G.

I'm really enjoying the epic that's opening up before me here, another
angle (personal testimony) of the struggles apparent in the mimeo
revolution publications and its aftermath.

I'm bemused, though, by the "war" analogy (as I was by the "anthology
wars"). Certainly in constructing new structures poets, editors &
academix wage "ideological wars" in their own minds & in their own
"camps."  But is it really an appropriate analogy?

In the case of censorship, where, for example, the editors of
the Chicago Review probably "battled" with the administration
before quitting & starting Big Table - a sort of second-wave mimeo
revolution, and certainly a "turning" as the term suggests, the analogy
seems appropriate.

Are there other particular (cross-camp) cites/battles to support a more
general application? When one asserts a position or "claims a territory"
that is yet unclaimed (being a sort of virtual territory -- publishing a
little mag doesn't necessarily take territory "away" from other such
publications) and there is no "battle," why is it a "war"?

thx.  Linda Russo

Except that this appropriation was enacted with a sense of language as
noone's property, and, in fact, in direct dispute with the presentation by
a more narrative poetics of private experience as primary content for
poetry, and a spelling out, for example in Rae Armantrout's wonderful
review of the Morrow Anthology in Poetics Journal, that there are
consistent themes/formulas (and some rather dangerous ones at that) in
those supposedly individual experiential voice-poems which made up that
anthology and more. So that (leap with me here) the lang experiments were a
kind of freedom from ownership, freedom from language (more or less
restricted in many ways) as capital in poetry. Freeing "language itself"
from "language as mine (the poet's and a certain invited-to-overhear
audience)."

Whether this was successful or not is a big issue -- but did it create what
you call, Henry, "a new kind of private property?" It does seem to have
created a broad range of strategies for poetry which can now be used, and
maybe can only be used, without the kind of "dynamiting" function of which
you speak. And, if robbed of that, then also robbed of a good deal of the
political import. Still, though, the gap between subject and what is
enunciated, is a real gap which still engenders real exploration. The work
is not only political, but psychological, cultural -- and to my mind, is
still allowing new and engaging explorations.

I don't give credit to their "difficulty" as the agent which separates such
poems from a wider audience. That seems too easy to me, and goes against
things I've learned in teaching, where much more so-called 'conventional'
poems are seen as equally difficult by a good many students. There are a
lot of things working in our culture against anyone reading any poetry at
all, whether it be W.B. Yeats or Bruce Andrews. What brings more to the
former than to the latter has a  lot to do with how we are taught to read
poetry, and what poetry we are encouraged to read by teachers, publishing
industry, bookstores, etc. By the age of 7 or 8, according to my direct
experience teaching workshops in elementary schools, half or more of the
students already think poems are supposed to rhyme. Perhaps such ideas are
formed much earlier, from nursery rhymes and early children's books. So,
are any of us ready to revamp the entire human curriculum (not just inside
the classroom) from birth? -- we may be ready and know it's necessary --
but how to do it???

I also think it's wrong, though, to see langpo as "the" alternative here. I
think it is one part of a broad range of innovative practices, which to me
still includes ideas from the various poetics included in the Allen
Anthology (Black Mtn, Beat, NY School, Deep Image, and more), from
specifically feminist poetics, from sound poetry, visual poetry, and much
more -- and by no means is all of this work "difficult" in ways which
should keep anybody away.

I rather like prospecting the dictionary.

I'm curious, why so few responses? Henry's comment above is very
provocative. And it comes from a fellow who really does read
and is clearly no lightweight in the head. Here we are getting at
what the World War of Poetry is all about, no?

Bernstein, Silliman, Perloff, Rothenberg and Joris (so much for your
anthology, according to Henry, apparently), Bromige, Quartermain,
etc. (and also everyone involved in the Alternativve Poetries
Conference in Boston and young turks of the New (American) Poetry
anthology): There is a pillbox to take! How many more comrades will
die, shredded on the beach, before you respond? Are you really just
a crew of aphasic, Scrabble-playing ninnies as Henry seems to
claim?

(And Henry, sincerely curious, what _do_ you think of the Poems for
the Millennium anthology? Most of that just grabbing from the
dictionary too? If there is work there you think is worthy, what is
it?)

Charles's post makes a lot of sense throughout.  Still, I would ask how you
differentiate a poetry that makes stereotyped lyric moments part of the
private property of the self, and a poetry that prospects out its own
private range, complete with anthologies, exegetes & explainers.  Nor am
I restricting this question to "language poetry" - I'm talking about
the anthologized "postmodern moment". I'm suggesting its difficulty is
one of its attributes or properties which provides it with academic
exchange value.  For a long time on this list I have been promoting another
kind of difficulty - as something layered within a synthetic, communicable
"prose" speech that can rise to poetry.

Does anyone on this list, in their heart of hearts, not WANT this if it
indeed means paradigms that are not arbitrarily territorial?  And if I
believe with Charles Alexander that the learning begins with the young'ins
do we really expect their weary public school reading teachers to look for
clues and fodder in Poetics Journal before they try the NYT Book Review (why
NOT know what's on that ticker, appalling as it be, as well as on other
tickers)?  Why NOT expect "literary literacy" to include Bayley -- off-base
though he be on poetry, not his forte and ill-chosen clearly by NYRB --
along with Pound -- god love 'im off-base on a people?

My own work may play as more "conservative" than much on this list (yes one
of my poems was a Hollander selectee) but I'll freely admit I have not the
courage of some of you in accepting the colors and wielding the weapons.  To
me, this territory war seems to me like the tiniest subset of larger
cultural and economic dynamics, and I choose cowardice and selfishness in
pretending that I can ignore categories in order to write with a greater
sense of freedom, even if it be self-illusory -- instead of using up this
energy in sandbagging the brittle dams the waves are toppling anyway.   Or
so I think when I feel called to justify.

Yeats is inappropriate in some ways as pole star for a "synthetic"
tradition of poetry, because of his long engagement with Blake and the
fact that an elaborate, "archetypal" system underlies all his seemingly
lucid lyricism.  One of the most important Yeats' critics, Hazard Adams,
claims that all of his work is of a piece, and poems inevitably take on
different meanings when referred back to his system.  Yeats' strategies
were not "disjunctive" as such, and he created a system that aspired to
totalization, but nevertheless, there is an esoteric, some would say,
obscurantist, aspect to his work that makes it resonate much with Ron
Silliman's work as it does with Robert Hass's.


In terms of a modest, synthetic style, the precursor I would put here is
Auden.  And of course Auden estranged his vocabulary with the use of
jargon words as well occasionally awkward musics.

Finally, Yeats rediscovered Blake for the 20th century, whom Eliot claimed
wrote outside of tradition in his own esoteric vocabulary.  Vendler might
say the same thing.  Of course, Blake is the perhaps the most "webbed"
romantic poet there.  History has made nonsense of Eliot's criticism, and
given comfort to many unregarded poet--perhaps too much.  This is not to
say that mystical Yeats is the only Yeats or even that one has to read a
Vision in order to understand Yeats' great political poems (let me add
that it is
offensive to me to stereotype Yeats as a fascist pure and simple when his
politics are much more complex).  It does suggest that there usually more
than two sides to great poets.  It also suggests a more complex
"situating" of elite and popular poetries, along the lines of the
rationale for parables in christian discourse:  those in the know will
understand the kernel of meaning around which the germ (often the rather
obvious moral) is wrapped.

As far as modest, narrative, historical poetry, I can suggest two
candidates, one facetiously and one not.  Michael Lind (a student of
Frederick Turner, though not really a "professional poet")  has written a
narrative poem about the fall of the Alamo, which by many accounts sinks
under the bathos of sentiment and the banality of verse.  Out here in
Seattle, we have an interesting poet, Jana Harris, who has written a long
poem (really a series of poems) about the settling of the Northwest.  Of
course, Lind, because of his New Republic and political connections (his a
neo-con who has turned against neo-cons), has gotten a lot more publicity.

I wonder where would bp nichol fall in this (perhaps by now discarded)
distinction?  perhaps as a run-up to the coming conference we could start
a nicholian thread?

unravellingly yours
Robert

Henry, I would certainly grant you the point that "difficulty" gives a lot
of poetry, postmodern and otherwise, and a lot of music and art and science
and mathematics, a certain "academic exchange value." I think a lot of
people in the academy who study poetry want a challenge. I want a
challenge, too, as a reader. But you speak of this difficulty as though it
is something consciously just layered on, as if poets are saying, "oh we'd
better make these works difficult," rather than respecting their various
projects as inherently involving and leading them into ideas and
intermeshings of language with ideas, that are themselves quite difficult
at times -- although not, I think, all the time. Whereas you seem to be
espousing a "kind of difficulty" which is entirely involved with the
content of what is said, and not the form, if what you want is really this
"communicable prose" speech that you put forward. There is such work I
admire, but I certainly don't think it any more worthy than work whose
intellectual/emotional difficulty crawls right into the craggy
juxtaposition of phonemes and morphemes, the gaps between one enunciation
and another.

As for "rising" to poetry, though -- I have trouble with that metaphor, as
I don't necessarily see poetry as occupying a higher ground than prose, or
scientific writing, or mathematics, or any other such endeavor.

And I guess I do differentiate "stereotyped lyric moment" poetry from what
you term as "poetry that prospects out its" language, content, and form.
You seem to want to link the two on the shared plateau of privacy. Yet in
the one, you admit that privacy is a matter of the idea of self and its
transcendence (perhaps) through those lyric moments, whereas in the other
you argue that the privacy comes from what you see as "difficulty." I
think, even for those who might agree with you that both achieve a kind of
privacy (and I don't think I'm one of those), it would be evident that they
are entirely different kinds of privacy won in entirely different ways. And
I certainly see it as fine to value one over the other.

I think Robert Corbett's last post said, much more eloquently than I did,
what I had meant to say about Yeats--his sort of bizarre occultish side
making him the precursor of people like Duncan. A thought experiment--what
if Yeats had been neglected for years and suddenly been discovered as a
cult figure, not associated with any sort of official modernism at all?

A question for Mr. Gould:  what contemporary American poets represent the
legacy of Yeats as he understands it?

"God bless henry" for asking tough questions - but I have to say I think
he's completely wrong here, both about the motives behind experimental
writing and the state of American poetry: so 1) as for the state of Am Po,
I think its quite alive and well, thank you.  Henry, do you know how many
people read Williams *Spring and All* when it came out - well, the thing
did not sit in the window of a Barnes & Noble - we're talking a handful of
people in the Village (the "Others" crowd) and a few other like-minded
souls.  It's that retrospective vision which kills - eg, "jeez, no one
seems to be as celebrated as Williams" (or Whitman, Wordsworth, ...).  Of
course, we're not the print culture we once were, & as far as I'm
concerned that's great - I love TV, films, visual arts, jazz, hip-hop
(and look at me, mom, I'm still writing!).  As for the argument that the
good stuff is abroad, well, hell, that's the oldest one in the book - I
love much international poetry (I'm publishing the wonderful avant-garde
Russian poet Lev Rubenstein in the next COMBO), but rhetorically, I think
the celebration of such often depends on an old "great poems are written
in times of war and strife" mentality which, frankly, makes me squeemish.
And as for the NYT Book Review and its ilk, there a big bore - but more
than this, they're not very important - the suggestion that they are
Foucaultian wielders of clout doesn't hold water anymore, I think - I
think I'm fairly representative of intellectuals of my generation and I
hardly ever touch it.  Likewise with the writers they promote - Pinsky may
get around with NYT types in midtwon Manhattan but I have never - never -
heard of his books being taught in five years at Penn - in contrast I've
taught Hejinian, Silliman, Perelman, Bernstein and their friends to
hundreds of students - who, I might add, dug their poems a whole lot.  I
say this only because I believe we need to be disabused of the idea we've
all somehow run out of gas: for me, to take that attitude is to make the
fatal mistake which Foucault was always on the verge of making:
confusing one's personal struggle with the universal state of things.

So, 2) there are GOOD REASONS for writing experimentally that have NOTHING
TO DO with an "innovation for innovation's sake" position: rather, in Am
Po, one can follow a tradition from Emerson & Wm James to DuBois, Stein,
Dewey, Williams, Burke (all in one way or another students of James) to
to the New American Poetry generally, which invests in an experimental
methodology precisely BECAUSE they believe that langauge is "a function of
public communication."  That is, they see language as symbolic action and
they believe that experiment/innovation has a symbolically active set of
points to make.  Some of these writers are radical democrats trying to
make language/syntax function more democratically on the level of symbolic
action; others have Marxist predilections and are in the general area of
Jameson (a serious student of Burke) in their considerations of symbolic
action (particularly as Jameson works in The POlitical Unconscious).

My point here is that these writers are damn serious and *not*
self-indulgent in their pursuits (that is, not any more self-indulgent
than we all are on a day to day basis).  You may think this is bullshit bu
I'll take the philosophical (and social) rigor of James or Burke (or
Cornel West, or Nate Mackey) any day.  So viva poetry!!!    -m.

No matter who you're talking about, the "academic exhange value" of any
contemporary poetry is assumed to lie in its ability to be _promoted_ in
the critical essay or review.  Whether you're writing on John Hollander or
Charles Bernstein, Amy Clampitt or Susan Howe, academic value is wrenched
out of poetry as a relentless critical project.  Pick your own favorite
essay on a poet and see if it matches this rough structure:

1. Most contemporary poetry is [moribund, pathetic, too academic, not
academic enough, too trendy, not trendy enough, too much form, too much
content].  [Pages of examples]

2.  The work of [poet's name here], however, bucks this trend.  As a
result, [poet's name here]'s work has been ignored.  Critics have hitherto
been unable to deal with this poet's [intellect, emotion, epistemology,
sexuality, bad attitude, vocabulary] and have written [poet's name here]
out of the canon.  I propose to correct this oversight.

3. [Pages of counter-examples from the work of the poet]

4. If only the world would pay attention to [poet's name here], we
would all love poetry.  Pity the world doesn't follow my shining
example.

Now THERE'S a bankrupt tradition for you: yet it seems to be viable all
over the place, certainly not restricted to any one wing of the academic
critical establishment.

The kind of difficulty I espouse is very close to what R. Corbett described
regarding Yeats: layers of meaning steeped into a kind of forthright, singing
syntax.  This is what I find in the Russians too, Mandelstam & Akhmatova in
particular. Ars est celare artem = art is to hide art.  Kent, there's
nobody in the pillbox; Jonathan, I don't read much contemporary work; I
read stuff I need for my own writing.  If Vallejo, Mandelstam, Celan,
Akhmatova, Dickinson, Yeats are in the Millennium anthology, they are
some of my favorites, good.  I've been reading Portuguese Cape Verdean
popular poems for a project I'm working on; I've been reading Under the
Volcano by Malcolm Lowry because his anti-hero Geoffrey Firmin, like me,
identifies with William Blackstone. Susan, sorry the wars cause headaches;
my strategy is to hammer away at people so they figure out how to read
my stuff if it ever gets published. Plus I like the idea of something
after postmodernism. Aside: there was a CD not long ago of
Yeats poems performed by various Irish pop music groups. - Henry Gould

What interests me most about this discussion, which I'm joining awfully
late, are Henry's primary charge (that the counter-tradition may be
bankrupt) and his secondary charge (that the counter-tradition is left
out of the most prominent debates about poetry because of a willful
obscurity).  These are important issues, presented as real challenges,
and if this makes Henry a bull then we need more bulls, no matter
whether we agree or disagree.


With regard to the secondary charge:

Peter Barry had a lot to say about this in the English context at the
London conference being discussed in the Anglo-American thread.  He made
the US out to be a greener pasture, but I think his comments apply here,
too (others have discussed this better than I could on the thread I've
mentioned).


With regard to the primary charge:

It seems to me that traditions of poetry _can_ decline into mannerism,
and that one way this can occur is through value being judged
predominantly on the employment of one particular poetic element.  For
example, when we fetishize a particular subject matter (personal trauma,
say, or ethnicity) and judge poetry primarily on the basis of that
subject matter, we risk mannerism -- think of the fate of confessional
poetry.

We also run this risk when we fetishize a particular formal quality, and
judge poetry primarily on the basis of the use of one particular trope
or formal element.  The decline of formalism from Frost to _Rebel
Angels_ seems to me to come from the fetishizing of full rhyme without
enjambment, for example.  But the decline of formalism into mannerism
isn't a matter of controversy on this list -- as the charge that the
syntactic disjunction of language poetry has become mere mannerism is.

What about that charge?  Are we left with "inchoate jumbles of broken
syntax" littering the journals, as Henry claims?  The question is worth
following up, so kudos to Henry for raising it.  (And kudos to Kent for
giving some perspective by reminding us that there are more bad poems
that work through coherent synatax and image than there are bad poems
that work through disjunction).

I thin it is demonstrable that that there is still important poetry
being written in the syntactically disjunctive mode (just now I've been
reading some by Catherine Walsh, but there are American examples too).
But my sense is also that there is a hell of a lot of mannerist late
langpo that disjoins for the sake of disjoining and that doesn't give us
anything new or powerful.  And I think that the most exciting energies
in poetry in the US and elsewhere are to be found neither in the (for
lack of a better shorthand term) mainstream nor in the language poetry
tradition (see Archambeau duck behind the nearest tree, the peep out
sheepishly to see if the lead is flying).

Who or what am I talking about?  I hope some of this will be apparent
when the first issue of _Samizdat_, a journal I'm editing, comes out at
the end of the month.  If you're interested, I can wrangle a few free
copies -- backchannel with your street address.  Of course, you're also
free to subscribe ($10/year -- three tabloid-format issues).

There is that.  Whatever else is to be said about Pinsky, I'm sure he's

Oppen.

This discussion about 'paradigm' shifts has me examining again something I am just reading now in Gary Taylor's book and then comparing it to some remark by Octavio Paz in the 'Preface to his book ONE EARTH, FOUR OR FIVE WORLDS, which I first read a few weeks back.

For example,

From CULTURAL MEMORY by Gary Taylor:

"In his book _The Structure of Scientific Revolution_ , Thomas Kuhn argues that science does not 'progress' in the orderly, incremental way we usually assume; instead, scientific revolutions turn the established worldview on its head, replacing one paradigm with another. The new paradigm is not necessarily better; it is just different, so different that it cannot really be compared with the old paradigm, because there is no common standard of measurement that both paradigms would accept. Kuhn divides the history of science into brief periods of revolution, when paradigms shift, and much longer periods of normal science, when researchers investigate technical problems defined by the prevailing stable paradigm. We especially remember the revolutionary periods and the scientist associated with them because they generated an exceptionally large intellectual stimulus. . .…"


From Octavio Paz:

"Like the Mayas, who had two ways of measuring time, the 'short count' and the 'long count', French historians have introduced the distinction between 'long duration' and 'short duration' in historical processes. The first designates the broad rhythms that, through modifications that are imperceptible at first, alter old structures and create new ones, thus bringing gradual but irreversible social changes. Examples include increases and decreases in population, which are still not entirely explained; the evolution of sciences and technologies; the discovery of new natural resources or their gradual exhaustion; the erosion of social institutions; the transformation of mentalities and sensibilities. . ."

" 'Short duration' is the domain par excellence of the event : falling empires, nascent States, revolutions, wars, presidents resigning, monica lewinsky, assassinated dictators, crucified prophets, sanctimonious crucifiers, ken starr, etc. [yes, I made a clever revision here]

History is often compared to a woven fabric, the work of many hands; without deciding on a pattern beforehand, and without knowing exactly what they are doing, these hands weave threads of every color together until a succession of figures, at once familiar and enigmatic, appears on the loom. From the point of view of 'short duration', the figures are not repeated : history is constant creation, novelty, the realm of the unique and singular. From the standpoint of 'long duration', repetitions, ruptures, and renewals can be perceived: rhythms. Both visions are true."

Wow, this sounds weird to me. Maybe it's just that NZ has nothing to
compare to the Ivy League establishment, but I don't know many people here
who would say that academics were anti-intellectual. In popular usage,

         academic = intellectual = pretentious = bad.

I've probably been exposed to too many open mike nights (where anything
that's influenced by poets more serious than Jim Morrison is 'academic') or
'Sundaystream' Poetry Society readings (where anything other than a haiku
about one's cat is 'academic'). I'm used to being abused as 'academic',
though I haven't studied literature formally since I was 16. One gets
labelled as a postmodernist (= especially bad) if one's poems don't rhyme.

Most 'established' poets here work in or are friendly to the academy, but
the academy is neither stuffy-leather-armchairs staid nor (except perhaps
in Auckland) radical-political-post-modernist. I suppose it's close to the
Iowa school: middle-brow cultured liberal, with an emphasis on 'common
sense' and being down-to-earth. Blame it on the sheep, I guess.

If I were being less facetious (and I suppose I'd better make an effort),
I'd say that the phrase 'academic poetry' refers here to anything that
requires a post-compulsory education to appreciate. It has nothing to do
with the qualifications or career of the poet: an English professor who
writes nice little poems about trees and mountains is not academic; but a
truckdriver who quotes Derrida is.

How about: Bill Manhire, Te Mata Wines Poet Laureate?

Actually, I've no objection to this sort of sponsorship: Te Mata are not
exactly a megacorporation (and anyone who can make a wine like their
Coleraine is okay with me); the post lasts two years, requires no "Ode to
Merlot", funds the publication of a book and results in more public
awareness for poetry. Maybe we need more sponsorships like this?

Well okay, sure.

But other than these few extremely rare exceptions (so rare, they're hardly
worth commenting on) can you really make a case for corporate sponsorship?

Subject:      Re: angling others / different tracks through the woods / lofgish
              rant

As far as I know, the concept of the academics commenting
on contemporary poetry has a very short history -- beginning
in the 20th century, no? -- with the introduction of studies
in the UK cirrculum. Harvard, for example, began much later;
not sure when. Does anybody know when the correspondance
between the academy and the poets began, with the poets as
supplicants? Perhaps it all began when Eliot dropped out
of philosophy to begin writing; the footnotes to The Waste
Land seem to demand three classical scholars and a sociologist
to decpiher.

I'd be interested to hear how critics within the academy
perceive themselves. Do you consider your position in the
university as a handy way to support yourself in what you
love to do? Or do you perceive a more organic communication
between the university (and all the social and intellectual
privileges that entails) and your work? That you share a
building with, say, the historians, who indirectly codify
and thus direct the course of history -- does this seem to
mirror your own experience of working from "within"?
(Or "more blue", for those tired of spatial metaphors.)

On a side note; my comment that "why can't critics stick
to talking about the poets they like" seems in retrospect
to be a little naieve. I was thinking of the kind of criticism
-- very valuable -- that goes on in the letters of a man such
as Keats, or Pound, where they trash various writers that
would be considered today a "vital" part of a critic's repertoire --
Milton, for example. A critic perhaps has more responsibility
-- but this seems to return to the question of how the critics
see themselves in relationship to the university.

Subject:      Milosz

On a different subject; I've been reading Czeslaw Milosz's journal
_Year of the Hunter_, which he kept from late 1987 to mid 1988. Here's
an entry from November 17th, 1987 (which seems somehow significant --
the only date near it that I can think of is Guy Fawkes.)

        I try to read contempgrary American poetry conscientiously. It's
        understandable that where there are thousands of poets, the
        overwhelling majority cannot be worth very much, though they provide
        an incentive and nourishment for the few, just a handful; it's the
        same everywhere. Something similiar is happenang in modern painting
        and the results are similar, too, because the paintings afford little
        pleasure.

        One can say about these poets that their technique is first-rate, but
        that they have nothing to write about. Their "life experience" shows
        through every line of verse; it is the life of lecturers on
        university campuses or in high schools and what they describe most
        frequently is their family-life complications, their own or heard
        about in the neighborhood bar. It is a common, monotonous reality,
        free of historical earthquakes; at most, it includes one or two
        earthquakes, in a literal sense. Nothing drives them to leap like
        salmon confronting an obstacle. Precisely that, this "having nothing
        to write about", is, in my opinon, quite a universal problem to be
        studied.

Many things in this quote. First of all, the difference between
his perception of American poetry and the one that has dominated this
list discussion. For Milosz, it seems, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E folk are
wound like ivy to the sonnet writers. The attention, which is rare
these days, to content, sticks out in my mind -- which might be due to
Milosz's encounters with a language he doesn't write in?

And the notion of historical earthquakes? What does he mean? It all
seems rather odd to someone who grew up on poetry as the product of a
comfortable life -- from Aeschylus to Keats and on. Not that all
poetry need be generated from peace, but certaintly not that war or
"earthquakes" need be the sole generators of verse. Perhaps he means
conceptual earthquakes -- but it seems that then only the first to
arrive on the scene would claim the prize. A later arrival would, no
matter what the skill, would fail to experience the earthquake and be
left "common, monotonous".

And finally, I'll take issue with the (slightly snide) remark about
lecturers and high school teachers, which on later consideration
seems not so snide. There needs be, for Milosz, some kind of
substrate from which is thrown up from time to time the "great",
something more than a "community" it seems, but rather a community in
the land of word. It's slightly mystical, even, the way that he believes
the unread chapbooks of the many provide "nourishment for the few".

Enough. Best wishes to all,

-- Simon

PS: I hope nobody on the list takes my quote of Milosz as a
my criticism of academics who write poetry -- a broad class
that would draw in many fish, including minnows such as myself.

I disagree.  I don't believe language, even in the texts of the dreaded
<Language Poets>, CAN be private property.  I believe language is
inherently communal.  This presumption changes how one _reads_ such
texts-- de-esotericizes them, if you will.  Perhaps this, I think
strange, belief in language as private property in modernist &
postmodernist writing (since I assume you would probably extend your
critique not just toward Langpo, but perhaps also to Stein, Zukofsky's
_"A"_, Un Coup de Des, _Finnegan's Wake_, etc.) explains why you are
seemingly incapable of reading these texts with pleasure, or without
annoyance.  Whereas someone like me, who doesn't share your belief in
language as private property in or outside of these writings, IS capable
of reading these texts as non-esoteric-- as a liberation & a pleasure.

 Perhaps it was all the war talk around here lately that made Robert
Archambeau dive behind that tree. Robert! You can come out now! No more
shrapnel! (Stephen Ambrose -- that crusty old fart! -- turns out to have
been Spielberg's technical advisor on matters warlike and was on
McNeil-Lehrer tonight . . .)

I apologize for letting Henry defend that hill all by himself for the
last few days -- as someone who usually agrees with him (well . . .
about 75% of the time), it was cowardly on my part not to have joined in
until now. But I was just waiting to hear how Gary Sullivan fared on his
vacation quest.

But seriously folks, the sad truth is -- I'm having to fight off
becoming a double agent, because I've been giving a close (academic)
reading to Marjorie Perloff's _Writing Poetry in the Age of Media_
(which many of you receiving this transmission will already know). And
Henry -- she hasn't convinced me, but she sure is asking the right
questions!

Listen to this, just from the first page of the Preface: She quotes a
line from Diane Ward which is the KIND of thing I think Henry has been
complaining about -- "Dark windows in which a list followed by facts in
us erupt chilling comparing" -- and then says:

"Our first response to such 'sentences,' especially when there is a
whole paragraph or page of them, is that we are the victims of some kind
of scam. There are, so the common wisdom goes, a bunch of mandarin poets
around . . . who have some sort of murky relationship to Deconstruction
and write meaningless and pretentious trash that they pass off as
literature. . . . For reasons unclear, a significant body of poetry (or
what claims to be poetry) has been produced that is unnaturally
_difficult_ -- eccentric in its syntax, obscure in its language, and
mathematical rather than musical in its form."

She took the words right out of my mouth -- my mouth in the early 1980s,
that is. Veterans of this list will perhaps remember my disinclination
to appreciate the project of Mssrs. Silliman, Watten, et al back in
those days (and by the way, I was glad that Kent, in his initial
response to Henry, was also critical of the "there is no referent"
philosophy). But Marjorie, in this book, has set the bar for critics
like myself at a very great height. That doesn't mean I'm going to stop
vaulting, just that I really recommend this book as some of the more
stimulating -- and infuriating! -- criticism I've read.

I'll have more to say (perhaps only in the form of backchannels to
Marjorie) about this opus as I get further along, but have two questions
immediately: one, is the "aspirational thought" of John Cage that she
cites really a model for anyone here? That is, are we bound, as current
practitioners, to find a way OUT of our present mess, rather than just
present the mess? And two, she quotes our List Master as differentiating
between modes of fragmentation, preferring the kind that "reflects a
conception of meaning as prevented by conventional narration . . .
dipping into other possibilities available within language." In this
formulation and others I've seen promoting "discovery," I smell the
vague but undeniable odor of mystification -- we can never say exactly
WHAT those "other possibilities" are. Fair enough, but when does the
endless spiraling outward become simple bad faith?

Jack Kimball has asked me to post a list of some interesting names in current
Brit poetry.  I'll do my best to give you, say, 50, very much off the top of
my head, with absolutely no order of importance implied by the list.

You see, what I'm really asked to do here is create an anthology via the
immediacy of e-mail.  This can't be a list of that kind: it would take
research and fuller memory recall.  I've probably forgotten my oldest friend!
At present, most US views of the British scene are somewhat narrowed by the
preoccupations both of US poets and British poets who have so far compiled the
names or arrange the conferences.  Nothing especially wrong with that, but
below is a fairly non-partisan list from someone who hasn't lived in Britain
for nearly two decades and will miss quite a bit, I expect.  May other Brits
correct me.

A "T" means I have at least some contact or channel, sometimes close but not
always.   If Jack or anyone else is interested in following up on a name and I
can help, I'd be glad to (within reason).

On point one:  the thought of poets of any stripe setting themselves the
project of finding pat answers is an unhappy one.  Yet there are no neutral
descriptions, and even should one attempt to "just present the mess" such a
presentation will insensibly move in certain directions.  I would consider
the principle of "aspirational thought" to be satisfied if the writer can
keep the ambiguities of the situation in suspension rather than
crystallising prematurely.  Which I think  fits well  with Cage's awareness
that chance and cadence have the same root.

On point two: .  My initial reaction to fragmented syntax was that  it may
be used as a probe which does not impose any particular hierarchy on the
possibilities it discovers.  And it seemed that the experience of the
reading was an inseparable part of the text.  Which is why I think it is
hard to talk about such poetry without falling a little flat: the analysis
of a rollercoaster ride in terms of velocity and pitch is not quite the
same as the real thing.  The what of those "other possibilities" can be
indicated explicitly, if not definitively, in terms of individual texts,
and I am strongly  tempted to demonstrate this, only an unwillingness to
inflict what may be entirely personal lucubrations preventing me.

You're invited to an evening of langu(im)age, an opening/reading/party
at The Globe Cafe in Seattle.

VISUAL POETRY OPENING:
The pornomorphs will be loosed upon the unsuspecting (but not entirely
innocent) patrons of The Globe for a month or two (as long as Robin can
stand them) in high res, color wax prints hanging from the ceiling and
adorning the walls. Some of the pornomorphs are in a preliminary Web
state currently at
http://www.speakeasy.org/~jandrews/vispo/images/GarbOTheGods/SexGoddess.html.
These images are drawn from porn on the Net, so if you find such things
offensive, please pass on this one. They will be accompanied by the
texts on the Web.

The other side of the Globe will feature high res, wax print versions of
some of the images at
http://www.islandnet.com/~jandrews/mocambo/jimvispo.htm and their
accompanying texts.

POETRY:
I'm very proud to have Joseph F. Keppler, Robin Schultz, and margareta
waterman reading/performing at the Globe with me on this evening of
langu(im)age. The four of us share a passion for all the dimensions of
language.

margareta waterman wrote the primordial alphabet, cloud coop songs,
occam's razor, and several others she's published, along with the works
of many other poets, within her nine muses books.

Joseph is the editor of Poets.Painters.Composers and is a poet,
photographer, and sculptor. His readings are legendary, as is his
innovative, powerful work in multiple mediums.

Robin is the owner of The Globe Cafe. His most recent book is LOVE, OR,
which evolved from responses to a wall-sized visual poem Robin did in
the cafe. The Globe is itself an interesting work of visual poetry
featuring visual poets and their work constantly. There's a visual poem
on the ceiling. Until recently there were phrases dangling from the
ceiling. And they paint over the full wall mural each year with a new
one by a different writer. It also features a great collection of small
press poetry available to the patrons. O yes and the food! The Globe is
maybe the only vegan restaurant in Seattle.

Party time.

TIME AND PLACE:
Saturday, September 5, 8 pm,
The Globe Cafe, 1531 14th, Seattle, WA
Refreshments and The Globe's excellent vegan victuals available.

This post suggested (for me) a way to cut through the many questions
that have arisen recently (Henry's) concerning the value of a
disjunctive poetics (its liveliness, how moribund, how vitalistic).

It seems to me that if a poem is disjunctive at the level of syntax
(fragmented syntax) then it will deny the reader an experience of
closure (the rounding out of musical or mathematical form).

This has always seemed to me the primary source of resistance to
disjunctive poetries. They prevent the reader from walking away with a
sense of  having got the meaning. They prevent my appropriation of their
language, of the language. Personally, I am not opposed to this state of
affairs--meaning I do not need/want/desire to make the poem mine, to
file it away in my heart as I have some sonnets by Shakespeare, for
instance. Disjunctive poetics requires a different reading process than
that. Even at the level of the glowing jolt (unexpected irony, often a
pun), I do not find the Emersonian holistic fragment.

What some seem to be asking then is this: is it possible to find
coherence at some level in a poem that is disjunctive on the surface? To
find such would allow them to walk away from the poem "owning" it. The
criticism may boil down to: "how much unownable poetry do we need?" One
response is: "we now have so much that the project seems 'moribund.'"

My counter question seems necessarily then: are there disjunctions other
than those of the surface?

Oh my mind boils with disjunctions and they do not cohere? but I do not
look to disjunction for redemption. I look at it as I look down the
barrel of a "fact" that I distrust. It speaks to something reeling in me
when it does speak and does not give me words for it.

What I think is interesting about some language poetry is that seems to
be something other than a mirror of otherwise inarticulable disjunctions
(that would make it surrealistic poetry). It gives language then a
presence that is materialistic, language becomes one of those facts that
I have stared at reeling--facts that for me might be likened to the
timbre of some music I love rather than its form or coherence.

I think this is essentially true, though I'd want to differ slightly - one
*can* appropriate the disjunctive poem: it's just that, one can't do it
unselfconsciously - that is, one can't do it without being painfully aware
that one has done it: I think must of the discomfort over, say, language
poetry, stems from this: that readers bred on staid narrative or formalist
poem do not want any conscious responsibility for the generation of
meaning, they would rather entertain the fiction that they have "got it" -
that there can be a transcendental (though also very ordinary) connection
between a)  authorial intention and readerly recption; or b) between
langauge itself (as deity) and the worshipping reader.  The only
difference, then, between, say, a Perelman poem and a Mary Jo Salter poem
- so far as reading practice is concerned - is that there is a codified
set of reading-rules for the latter which aids the reader so-inclined in
his/her pursuit of that "got it" feeling.  In contrast, since Perelman
"re-instates the vague" as Wm James put it, the reader has a heightened
awareness of her/his own complicity, and either says, "fuck this" and puts

Well, the property bit could take us into distant realms of abstraction...
but I guess it seems simplistic to say that language is "inherently
communal".  A big problem for the writer is to find the language that
CAN be shared in a way that gets across what she or he wants to get
across.  And my point was that the canonizing-publishing process gradually
applies the same "property effects" to experimental poetry as to the rest.

But this isn't the interesting issue.  You're wrong that I'm incapable of
enjoying innovative or disjunctive work - I think Don Wellman's description
of his response to some Language poetry was true & close to my own experience
of it.  But several posts have talked about "how to get into disjunctive
writing" from a sort of reader-response perspective.  You have to learn
to enjoy non-closure, etc.  But what if coming from the WRITER'S position,
these modes of composition are simply NO LONGER INTERESTING?  Do not
reflect the goals of the writer?  I think "closure" is a very weak
descriptor for what the writer is after.  What if postmodern perspectives
& techniques do not accomplish the writer's point of view?  That is
what interests me about approaches that Yeats (as ONE example) can
represent, in part: and I'm also talking about the micro levels of technique
from a WRITER'S perspective.  The idea that a synthetic approach to
syntax, rhythm & meaning is just a handy way to package McMeaning
ignores 95% of the fascination of the text or the performance, as far
as I'm concerned.

Good question....And worthy of being addressed on the List, i think.

Good poetry is possible in all modes, even the very conservative ones
favored by Henry.  He offers **no** substance of critique regarding
particular poets or poems; i see nothing to engage in his snipes.

I find Robert's bit quoted above far too broad and abstract to move us
much further....

This reification of broad critical categories ("syntactically disjunctive
mode"..ugh!) is just not very helpful.

Folks are chiming in with great sanctimoniousness (like Henry's own) about
how wonderful these crticisms are...Er, so far as far as i can see, the
clothes have no emperor.  Thus far.  Neo-conservatisim rools, i guess.

Fairly interesting.....There are two points here, Kent.  One is the
history of "rebellious, iconoclastic" rock&roll in relation to the US
military machine.  While playing hendrix and other disturbingly new r&r
has often been portrayed as a semi-rebel behavior, among grunts in Nam,
the military has recovered enuff to (albeit below the level of stated
policy) try to associate this "all american" form with their little
adventures.  Cf. the playing of r&r at Noriega to drive him out of the
embassy where he was holed up.

In general, this is an extension of the gradual appropriation of R&R by
the right as a symbol of machismo and jingoist national distinctiveness.
(Within this story there are many little mini-dramas, like Reagan and the
song "Born in the USA,"  etc.)

the second question is the history of the phrase itself.  By far the best
approach to this, at least as a place to start, are the essays collected
in Nick Tosches' book "Unsung Heroes of Rock & Roll."  The cumulative
thesis of that book is that the label should be used for pretty much any
strong-beat, straight-ahead music that somewhere used the phrase "rock" or
"rock and roll" for sex.  Whether it originated as blues, jump-blues,
piano boogie, or even came from a white artist with country roots like
Hard Rock Gunter.  This thesis is not widely accepted among rock
critics/scholars, to offer an understatement.  (But while simple-minded,
it's not the worst way to approach a thorny historical/theoretical issue)
But Tosches' claim for what can be called r&r music is beside the point:
in the process of making his claim, he traces dozens of uses of the phrase
in white and (mostly) black music before Berry, Little Rich. and Elvis.
Some certainly in the second half of the 1930s, as the so-called Bluebird
Beat uptempo sound was nudging country blues in the direction of a city
feel, and boogie piano and early efforts by Big Joe Turner and similar
shouters were rushing toward jump-blues, the black form that most directly
fed into "R&R."

So the short answer has two parts:  Yes, the phrase was fairly common on
the air waves, pretty much exclusivley as a very ungenteel, crude
reference to sex;  and No, unless the soldier shouting it was Black, he
was *not very likely* to know the phrase well and have it on the tip of
his tongue...

So this is a very direct and strong piece of anachronism, tying in to
(what i mentioned at first) the recent macho americanist/militarist
appropriation of the phrase....

You're welcome.  I agree with you on all these works, including your own;
but their refusal to fit that mold is one reason, perhaps, why their _own_
value is sometimes viewed suspiciously by perplexed readers who want the
same-old-same-old.  The effort to carve out a new cultural-poetic critical
writing is something I'm keenly interested in, as you know (and something
I view as basically collaborative, including all the above, myself, and
many others) -- readers' resistance to that critical work is buttressed by
the dominance of a stale "salvage"  model that always-already presents
itself as novel, even if its form is predictable in its entirety.

Mark, if you use the word "conservative" one more time, I might start to
think you are stooping to broad critical categories yourself.  You want
me to have a roll call of some of the hundreds of "disjunctive" poets?
It's unfair to talk about pervasive styles?  What is poetics anyway?
Ad hominem snipes at "reactionaries"?  The naked emperors in my battle plan
are the babies of the postmod scholars - those who lay claim to be the
few scholars attending to "contemporary" work - who have all the young
college students getting headaches over their turgid academic poetry.
But you stick with the ad hominems, Mark - it's a way of showing that
post-lang people can still get personal. - Henry G.

Should we criminalize mediocrity?
                 There are practical details to be worked out...
So few of us (brilliant intellectuals) left to run the nation
And who among us is not mediocre?
Though to have escaped detection for so many years
                is itself a form of genuis.
Conversely, the prisons would be filled with insecure genuises
Who would sooner confess their mediocrity
                than endure the agonizing wait...


On another note:  Henry declares American poetry at an impasse--but he
doesn't read his own contemporaries, since they are not necessary to his
own writing.  All other poets fall into some category which disqualifies
them in advance--New York poets are snide art-world groupies, Language

One of the most helpful theoretical claims to emerge from the recent
decades has to do with what a poem does.  Ultimately, this claim is useful
to cobble together an approximate measure for all kinds of poetry,
including more normative types accepted throughout most of the literary
establishment.  (One thing lost in the last few days, partly because of
the high-intensity of Henry's rhetoric, is that almost all
financial/institutional resources in our culture, are still geared toward
lionizing and supporting "art writing" of a very conservative sort, which
actually quite directly dismisses most vibrant writing as irrelevant..)
But mostly this theoretical claim is about what less mainstream types of
writing are setting out to try to do...

The claim is, that poetry can and does actually create and set in motion,
and constitute, an experience.  It is not (or should not be) about
evoking, recapturing, describing or narrating an "experience."  It is, in
and of itself, experience.

This seems a very uncontroversial claim, if put forward about Monet or
Pollack, Mahler or Ornette, John Zorn or the Mekons, about many dance
pieces.  Even about the theater of Richard Foreman and his disciple Robert
Wilson (though they have their neo-conservative detractors).

But it is still hard to establish this as a working premise among poetry
folks.  None the less, i'm convinced that it is true.  It explains part of
what's going on in many of the best pieces of, say, Clark Coolidge.

Within the creation of a vibrant experience, there are always *thematic
resonances* ;  in Raphael there are angels, in Monet there are landscapes
and Parisians (and the angels and landscapes and Parisians often shimmer
with the tensions of history and perception..) , in a Mekon song there may
be 5 different social issues, twisted through 3 layers subjective
angst.... In all these forms, for the thematic "subject" to register,
there has to first be an electricity in the paint or the guitars (or the
words).

But the theory of recent decades points to a regard for the feel and
excitement of poetry, as in Coolidge.  A poet for whom thematic resonances
are primary, in a sense, is Susan Howe.  Yet her work *creates an
experience* ... The simultaneous marshelling (martialing?) of sound and
vizpo word patterns, of difficulty wading thru thick colliding lines on
the page, drags the reader into a historical morass of suspicion,
confrontation, violence and war..

I use the word "resonance" to emphasize that good writing can come in all
sorts of styles, including ones where the "subject" is embodied in the
text-texture;  thus, not using normal syntax or even normal words IS NOT
THE ISSUE  (which is why i dissent from the majority, who take henry's
broad generalizations seriously)

If we're thinking about work of the last few decades, that connects up
with Oppen and Zuke and Stein (and Vallejo and Celan), then the issue is
**the creation of vibrant experience through understanding and working
with your medium**

This point of view leaves plenty of room to admire and understand a fine
lyric written with more familiar verbal gestures and sytax, such as
Henry's "Notes on a Still Life," which i published in issue #4 of my mag,
Misc. Proj.  There are many different ways to kick consciousness in the
direction of an experience.

But this analysis is tied historically to a partisan stance in favor of
verbal adventurousness.  I believe what i'm refering to here is partly
what Ron had in mind in his comment (in ILS at the Perelman symposium?)
that there was still a long way to go in fully realizing a poetry that
transcends, or moves away from, "aboutness."

Indeed, there is plenty of room for *greater disjunction* among the tools
that prosody can reach for, at this juncture. No doubt many people are
doing bad poetry that uses forms of disjunction.  Not sure that this is
stunning news to most of us..Far more bad poetry is being published (in
more high-profile contexts) using the smooth sytactic flow HG likes.

But ultimately it is much more interesting to pursue directions of poetry
that are generative and risk-taking, and have a vector, soaring quality,
using different tools;  fear of "disjunction" (an inadequate term for
opnness to many different modes of text-structuring) seems uninteresting
and unhelpful.

You may be right, Jonathan.  I've sniffed out quite a few of them briefly -

A few basic points.  Yes, Mark, a poem is an experience in itself, but
not only that.  Art is not just about art; it's an apprehension of
experience and reality.  I have tried to suggest that the contrast of
Yeats/Pound might reveal a DIFFERENT PARADIGM for your vaunted "verbal
adventurousness".  An adventurousness revealed within a pattern of
normal or simple speech structures.  But the partisanship you subscribe
to is not open to this idea: your strategy is to set up the exemplars
(Clark Coolidge, Susan Howe, undoubtedly fine practitioners) - claim the
theoretical high ground (so much MORE bad middlebrow poetry is written
in traditional sentences) - and defend the pillbox, with its motto:
explode the forms (sentence, stanza, etc.).  And let the new generations
of radical resisters rise, proud & strong, unable to spell or write
a complex sentence, but hey - it's poetry.  My dislike for this
front is not a matter of snobbery, however.  I disagree with the
basic apprehension of reality underlying it, the philosophical bases.
But let's not get into a thing about politics or postmodernism.
BECAUSE art is about more than itself - these debates bring out
- or seem to bring out - IDEOLOGICAL differences over what "reality"
is, where our commitments lie. And that leads to more long boring
abstract debates... - Henry G.

While I agree with Jonathan's call for greater generosity to our
contemporaries, I thought it was interesting that he quoted O'Hara on
this.  I think that line speaks more to O'Hara's desire to have his own
poetry be as contemporary as possible and has less to do with the
poetry of his time written by others...

and remember his comment in "Statement for the New American Poetry,"
where his annoyance sounds a bit like Henry with one major distinction:

"I dislike a great deal of contemporary poetry -- all of the past you read
is usually quite great -- but it is a useful thorn to have in one's side."

I think that last clause makes all the difference.

This discussion also reminds me of O'Hara's quip about "mediocrity" and
the poetry of his peers that he didn't like, when asked to comment on it:
"It'll slip into oblivion without my help."

Take care,

wounds, it is written to protect the molester, it is written by incest
victims unable to acknowledge the fatal tinkering to which they were
subject while too green or too conflicted to enjoy their outrage.

I exaggerate? Name me one poet you admire who left Poetry the same as it
had been before. Poetry that opens my lips and shuts my mouth. Poetry that
wants me to lie down and let the past roll all over me. And makes me want
just that.

No no no no no ..........

Creating an experience, an experience field, has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do
with the art "being about art."  A sedate exercise in writing a poem
"about" a pre-existing "subject,"  where topical laziness kills the drive
and the writing, is more "about art" than a Howe or Coolidge poem is. Good
writing is a kind of perturbed severity, a confrontation with historicity
and difficult living.  It is complex and mobilizes sound and (may use) all
possible manner of typological textual arrangement. Including various
furors and strategies that middle-brow market-culture calls "nonsense" and
"disjunction."  (But these are inadequate words.)

I was arguing before (in terms i borrow from Silliman) for a writing
field-of-possibility within which at least some of the poets are "moving
away from 'aboutness.'  "  Which (you should note, but you haven't) has
NOTHING to do with not having thematic resonance.  How the hell could
Howe, the most deeply historical poet now writing, be "about art" fa
crissakes??

You are clinging to "aboutness."  I remain convinced that my field of
possibilities is more interesting and exciting.  But in any case i
definitely reject your terms and their conceptual underpinnings.

getting to the point of entry of particulars, the problems perhaps
boiling down to (not?) finding and making articulations, as critics,
readers, and writers, appropriate to quote-unquote disjunctive
poetries.

as has already been mentioned, "disjunctive" as a blanket term
pretty much loses any valence in terms of particulars.  take the
line by diane ward quote by joe safdie quoted by perloff, and take
another line by, say, karen mac cormack:

     Dark windows in which a list followed by facts us erupt
     chilling comparing.

     The point isn't just to changing points needs it overblown
     more than complex guarantee...

can we say what/how these lines mean, where the disjunctions occur
and what kind they are, give close readings that don't simply
normalize the syntax back into stable meaning(s), that in turn
allows us to draw larger implications for these individual works,
authors, and any "camps" in which they may be said to "belong"?

or how about two more examples, where the disjunction is taking
place more, but not exclusively, at a level between sentences than
within them:

     A paradox is eaten by the space around it.
     I'll repeat what I said.
     To make a city into a season is to wear sunglasses inside a
     volcano.
     He never forgets his dreams.
     The effect of the lack of effect.

     He would live against sentences.
     Trees here of leaf the several speakers.
     Tiered objects of her talking and water below.
     Trees of sound to broaden shadow.
     Damp walls will quiet things.

aside from taking these passage individually, can we discern
how/if, to follow donald wellman's question, there are disjuntions
other than those of the surface?  why/whether the first is barrett
watten and the second is michael palmer?  why/whether it matters?

enough with the rhetorical questions.  possible articulations as
critics/readers:
     1) close the book(s) in dismay or disgust, no meaning to get,
or, whatever meaning to be had not worth the effort, the
difficulties marking an area of exclusive or esoteric readership.
     2) perform the apologia pro poetica sua that it strikes me
perloff's commentary performs; which is not to slag perloff by any
means, but again the treatises in defense of langpoesie continue to
repeat the same arguments of old, cudgeling even the already
converted (read: mystified?).
     3) supplementary to 2), trot out critical truisms (i.e.
maintain the economy of academic exchange value) about the
challenges to stable reference, the resistance to meaning-as-
commodity, the invitations to the reader to create meaning, etc.
          corollaries to 3): a) read a given poet's (or poets') work
along these lines using a given theme, say, "(method)" in "(charles
bernstein)"; b) offer a close reading of a few lines as
synecdochally illustrative.

we are in dire need of further possible articulations.  we need a
critical vocabulary in which to fruitfully discern and discuss the
ways in which these writings are operating here.  if anything we
are truly lacking, rather than taking, a "theoretical high ground."

this i think is one aspect of the impasse that henry finds us in,
as pertains to critics and readers.

the other aspect pertains to writers (dividing poetic labor as such
for argument's sake).  again, henry chooses for his writing not to
follow such leads, a choice which should, if disagreed with, at
least be respected.  any choice entails risks, the risks of henry's
choice being apparent in the discussion.

the risks of the other choice, to follow the leads of
"disjunctivity" (but again the choice is not one of such simple
opposition; i can think of lise downe from toronto, whose two books
show a very judicious use of disjunction woven with a very
beautiful and more syntactically conventional lyricism), already
suggested, if somewhat bluntly, by mark p. and others, namely "bad
disjunctive writing," are indeed great.

the issue of eso/exotericism is a serious one, as is the
possibility that once the devices of disjunction have been laid out
the writing becomes simply a matter of manipulating the devices.
i wonder too, to get back to linda russo's earlier question about
the institutionalization of language writing can be thought to have
a part in this -- tho i can't imagine a workshop at, say, buffalo,
brown, naropa, ucsd, new college, etc., in which an young writer
would be told: "this is good, but it needs to be more disjunctive:
work in some anacoluthon here, use more parataxis here, and torque
it up a bit here..."

"disjunction"'s possibilities are far from exhausted.  with the
further development of such devices (as opposed to their mere
reiteration and recombination), however needs to come the further
development of critical sensibilities to distinguish how and when
the devices are operating and on what terms those operations can be
said to be "effective."  no division of labor here...

bests,
t.

But Mark, you yourself were just saying (in previous post) that poetic
theory has advanced to the point of recognizing that writing/reading a
poem is an experiential process.  You compared it to other art forms
(painting, poetry) to suggest that it's the thick textual/performative
experience, not the derivable meanings, that's the thing itself.  Okay.
I have no problem with that.  I just think that the thing itself is never
just the thing itself, and stylistic choices reflect stances toward
reality and history.  I introduced the Yeats / Pound argument not because
I'm stuck in the past, as Andrew Epstein seemed to imply, but because I
knew people would find it outrageous.  Susan Howe may be a deeply
historical poet, but that doesn't forestall entirely different approaches
to the same history (poetic and general history). - Henry G.

Simon DeDeo quotes Czeslaw Milosz saying that he finds American poetry
wanting because, among other things, American poets write from lives
that reflect:

 a common, monotonous reality, free of historical earthquakes;

To understand where CM is coming from, and why he'd find it second
nature to look for "historical earhquakes" in poetry, it helps not only
to think about him in the context of his own experiences in war-torn
Poland, but to think of the whole tradition of Polish poetry that, until
recently, was overwhelmingly vatic, historical and Romantic (Shelley
plays well in Warsaw).

The idea of a public poet speaking seriously of serious things and the
fate of nations has even become something of a burden for later Polish
poets -- there's that whole crowd of new, O'Hara-influenced Polish
poets, for example, or there's the concern with the personal and the
poetics of the private moment that we see in someone like Adam
Zagajewski.

Zagajewski often look deceptively mainstream to many Americans, who
often don't expect "historical earthquakes" in their poetry, but in
Poland this is considered fairly avant-garde.

Not to keep harping on _Samizdat_, but the new issue has an essay by
Piotr Parlej explaining Zagajewski's relation to the Polish national
tradition, as well as a couple of Adam's poems (in translation).  Once
I've learned more about the Polish O'Hara scene, I plan to run some of
their work, too (maybe in the December issue).

Henry: "And let the new generations of radical resisters rise, proud &
strong, unable to spell or write a complex sentence, but hey - it's
poetry."

Now, come on Henry: I realize we're in full generalizing mode at this
point in the dialogue, but, as a member of the "new generation," I write
one hell of a complex sentence, and am a fine speller.  Moreover, I'll go
toe to toe with anyone on the subject of Yeats anytime, any place.  The
point is this: why on earth is it so hard to believe that someone would
make a very honest (read non-conspiratorial) choice to employ
non-narrative rhetorical strategies without positioning herself against
every strategy employed in the days of yore, in fact, without situating
her verse as polemic in the least.  The poet is trying to do something
with the poem, to be sure, but rarely - rarely - is that thing a simple,
caricatured, attempt at "explosion."  I can never remember sitting down
with some paper and thinking to myself, "How can I go about lingusitically
exploding the world-structure?"  Is this a common point of departure for
anyone?  The truth is, motivations range widely but also, in a sense, stay
the same: some poets are interested in "the political unconscious" of form
- which is simply to say they believe that, on a contextual basis, grammar
and syntax can imply a politics; or more generally, that form is one
"anticipatory arena where actuality and possibility, past and present, are
allowed to collaborate on a history of the future" (James Livingston).  Or
put in the simplest form: some poets want to write in a new way because,
socially speaking, they want something new.  Other poets are more focussed
on finding a language which feels compatible with their immediate
apprehension of experience.  Provided there are measures taken
against self-indulgence, that's good and interesting too, isn't it?  And
might not  parataxis of one sort or another be one viable method for these
various motives?  And aren't those motives acceptable and worthwhile?  If
your answer to these questions is yes, then I suggest you take a harder
look at what is out there and what is coming out.  The difficulty of Yeats
is tempered by one's willingness to read Yeats long and hard - the reader
patiently develops a symbolic economy that will suffice.  But of course
he's "Yeats": the name alone goes along way to convincing us that the
effort is worth it. I know its hard to imagine b/c his context is too set
in stone, his methodology too clearly a link in the chain of tradition,
but would anyone  be able to read, say, "Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen,"
devoid of context?  Or, more to the point, would they bother?  "Many
ingenious lovely things are gone / That seemed sheer miracle to the
multitude, / Protected from the circle of the moon / That pitches common
things about."  Without context this too becomes gibberish.  What it comes
down to is whether you have any real interest in the methods and contexts
of these "experimental" poets.  If you do, you'll take the time to have a
good look and probably like much.  If you don't, ah well, you won't.  But
I don't believe the discussion of whether these poets are "good" or
"serious" is a very worthwhile discussion.  Clearly, they are serious,
and, in many contexts, good.

I've never met him, but judging from his posts during the time I've read
this list, Henry seems to read both the contemporary poets he has an
immediate affection for and those he has a hard time finding a way to
appreciate -- he seems to be that rare and wonderful kind of person who
doesn't read only what he suspects he'll find affirming.  Donald Davie
was like that -- a Larkinesque Movement poet who made himself read the
Black Mountain crowd and take them seriously, even if it was to
eventually reject most of what they stood for.  That way of going about
things somethimes made Davie into a raging bull, but people like that
keep us all honest and less complacent.  (sidebar: Davie was the first
critic I know of to understand much about Jeremy Prynne -- see the
chapter in _Thomas Hardy and British Poetry_).

If there are no bullets but only spitballs, hair-pulling and
name-calling, I suppose I can come out from behind that tree now.

thanks again, and it's true, i must admit, that the reception of my work if
i can be permitted so smug and grandiose a phrase has been very different
in the poetry world and in the cult stud world, which has been confusing to
me since the reception in the poetry world has been much warmer and more
proactive than the cult studs world although i find much of the poetry
world's concerns myopic and solipsistic (sp?).  still, the po-folks have
gotten excited about essays on kaufman and spicer/duncan, whereas in the
intro to that book i make a point of saying that the kaufman essay fits
most neatly into a dated "man and his work" salvage operation.  the cult
studs, on the other hand, to the extent that they've been interested at
all, have remarked on the material about previously unpublished "naive"
poets.  while i myself ahve found it more interesting intellectually to
write about the latter, the relatively warm response i've received from the
poetry community, combined with the way my tenure process straitjacketed me
into a "poetry job" (I was ordered to remove from my list of prospective
tenure reviewers people who were not primarily scholars of 20th c american
poetry in the narrowest sense of the term), has resulted in my gravitating
away from the subjects i found of intellectual interest.

Although this might be a gross over-simplification, one of the major
issues for me is that I would like the reader to be involved in
'constructing' the poem.  I am aware that this goes back to Iser and
there may be other sources I am not familiar with.

I am also aware that I tend very much toward th incomprehensible end
of the spectrum of asking the reader for input in building the
experience - i tend to often be as 'difficult' in my interpersonal
relations.

If i am right in this would there then be 'lazy readers' and readers
who are more willing to invest themselves?

Some of this concern for the reader and the relationship undoubtably
relates to my life as a practicing psychologist.  BTW it is my
impression that the field (and related fields) has abandoned focus
on self-revelation, confession, self-expresion, etc. so that poetry
of this type is to a large extent foundationless.  [however, there
are more specifically-defined and concrete areas where
self-expression and 'writing' - if done right - do have effects and
their efficacy has very good research support]

I don't think it's good to label readers who don't want to take these steps
as lazy. Some readers who don't want to join in the constructive process
may not understand the invitation. Others simply may not want to
participate in this way, while they may eagerly track down every reference
in a work by Olson or Pound, which is certainly another kind of investment.

What is it in various of poems which demand a reader's
participation/construction, that makes the invitation to do such work,
perhaps makes it rather obviously, or in a way which is encouraging? Or is
this necessary? And what, in other works, makes them come across as a brick
wall which resists such participation rather than inviting it?

These are some of the many questions we struggle with, as I don't think,
even with the most 'difficult' (and define that in Henry's way or any way
you wish) poets, there is a desire to not have a readership.

When I read what you have posted, I want more explanation of what you mean
is involved in the reader 'constructing' the poem. I think such an act is
involved in a lot of work talked about on the list, from Susan Howe to Alan
Sondheim. So I'm wondering if you have a more specific idea of such
reader-construction in mind.

Henry just sent this to me, having hit his daily list limit, & I thought
I’d post it  & use it as a way to get a little more concrete/specific in
my arguments:

"Mike, I never said "your generation" or any generation of "disjunctive"
[sorry] poets weren't good, okay?  What I did was suggest that a focus
on the distinction between a Yeats approach & a Pound approach, along the
lines of overall synthesis/disjunction of poetic materials, is not an
abstract or dated proposition.  The underlying assumption of your remarks
& those of Mark P. & others is that you represent the avant-garde, the
innovative, the exploratory, etc.  But you all don't make a good case for
that by defending the ramparts whenever a completely different paradigm of
writing poetry is suggested. - Henry Gould"

First, I can’t resist pointing out that Yeats and Pound don’t represent a
dichotomy - as Yeats’s secretary Pound was an observant student and
learned a lot (the book The Stone Cottage details this).  I don’t mean
this  to be catty - it actually helps me make a larger point, namely, that
our either/or approach to arguments about poetic innovation gets in the
way any attempt to discuss actual details in the poetic landscape (and
vice versa).  Though I hate to use myself as an example, I’m a good case
in point: my biggest influence as a college student was Robert Cording, a
professor at my college and a good poet who most people would consider
mainstream/normative, whatever label you might like to apply.  Through him
I read Keats, Wordsworth, Yeats, Frost, Stevens, Williams, Bishop, Lowell,
others. Now, I still read all these poets, though through a  somewhat
different lens and Bob Cording and I still talk about poetry, including
our own, all the time.  By most accounts on this list he and I should want
to kill each other.  But I think our relationship makes perfect sense and
that the tensions are productive.  Nor does it seem to me anomalous: how
else to explain Donald Hall’s longtime support of  Berrigan, Perelman and
others.  I don’t mean this to be a "why can’t we all get along" argument,
far from it.  But it sure would be nice to argue particulars every once in
a while.  Why does Donald Hall read Perelman so carefully (as he once told
me he did)?  Now that would be a question to answer with specifics.

So, now that I’ve advocated for specifics, I should probably make use of
some.  I thought I’d post and discuss a couple short poems that appear in
the first issue of COMBO, one by Lee Ann Brown, one by Louis Cabri, two
"my generation" writers with plenty of experimental pedigree.

Lee Ann’s:

"Valentines"

a wide-eyed leaning forward
chewing on the gristle
rolling our eyes
in the heart of the matter
glossy arches
liquid maps

we could use a place
like this in your neighborhood
Eat our vegetables
they'll do a gearbox good

Done details:
Memo
15 of 15
Valentines,
I kiss you
Six million times
plus one
raised to the max higher power
propertius anonymous
I won't give you away
don't put the light on
unless you absolutely have to


There’s so much to like here but the first thing I’d like to point out is
that the last thing in the world this poem does is arrogantly break of
communication with the reader.  There’s even some tried-and-true poetic
devices present: the linebreak at "we could use a place," for instance,
which broadens the possibilities in the casual sentence, "we could use a
place like this in your neighborhood."  In that line break I hear
Creeley’s insistence that "place is a real event - where you are is a law
equal to what you are."  As such, "we could use a place /" seems
emblematic of a desire for *position* (subject position? positioning which
would fuse "your neighborhood" with "my neighborhood"?) which runs counter
to the casualness of the sentence as a whole (we could use *any* place
like this) and counter to the desire for anonymity highlighted at the
poem’s end.  I like too the *range* in tone and style, all the different
registers: that serious conclusion out of context might be mistaken for
Adrienne Rich or someone - but it’s right next to "Six million times /
plus one / raised to the max higher power" - this is the language of
childhood "I hate you infinity plus one!") without the diminution in value
which would generally go along with it - then, too, there’s "rolling our
eyes / in the heart of the matter" gnarling two clichés together in a
manner which bears comparison not to Rich but to Chris Stroffolino:
putting these two clichés together somehow forces the words "eyes" and
"heart" out of the world of abstraction and back into talk of the body.
Obviously what happens there on the level of poetics (the way Brown very
consciously gets this effect) has major ramifications for the poem as a
whole, which is largely about bodies: bodies fed, bodies as maps, bodies
revealed, bodies concealed.  Anonymity is a kind of flexibility but also,
potentially, a kind of concealment, and this seems to be one conflict
latent in the poem.  Anonymity also can suggest the dangers involved in
naming, in coming into view: "I won’t give you away" - because if I give
you away (reveal who you are, where you are) then I give you away (give
you over to the hands of someone else).  That one is "given away" in a
marriage ceremony seems of potential relevance as well.  "liquid maps"
jumps out at me: what to do when maps are liquid, a question the poem
seems to complexly address.

So, on to the next one, Louis Cabri’s:

from *For Alan Davies*

"Water proof"

How about that, voice.
How about that voice.
How about that choice.

How about that bit.
How about that, hoarse.
How about that drink forgets it.

How about that quartz awhile replaced it.
How about that quart.
How about that habit dressed to spill now.

For instance how about that backyard time.
And that body too eh.
How about that comma rhyme.


I like the tensions set up right from the beginning.  The first line
evokes a kind of "New American" immediacy (Louis is Canadian): "How about
that, voice" - it seems to say, well, what do you know, here we are.  But
dropping the comma - "How about that voice" - makes the sentence look
backward at line 1 and the sense of immediacy is compromised: we’re
talking - possibly - about a previous voice now.  Likewise with the 3rd
line where we may be talking about the previous 2.  Tonally, I feel like
the poem can be read almost as elegy for this reason: each sentence looks
back on its predecessor and we drift closer to the past tense: this is
mediated by attempts to "replace" and "forget" (attempts which are
interestingly couple with more Steinian invention), but is reinforced
somewhat by "habit" and put pretty clearly in "How about that backyard
time" which wants to be extended into historical narrative - "How about
that backyard time when…" The last two lines seem to me to warn against
the seductiveness of invention for its own sake: the "comma rhyme"-as-"hot
body" a reminder of the masculinist fantasy of "breaking the mold," etc
(who called Olson’s model "the phallic lung"?)

Anyway, Lee Ann and Louis probably feel like I’ve butchered them in public
by now but, my own misreadings aside, I think the exercise has its point:
that these poems, by young poets whose names, if recognized, would be
pitched most assuredly into the "disjunctive" school, are actually
*highly* readable and pertinent to discussions of societies and langauges
on many, many levels.  There’s much good writing going on in all shapes
and sizes.

I was hedging some hunches in the last part of my post concerning the
"disjunctive" surface of the poem. Tom Orange's post has encouraged me
to elaborate more on what is on my mind. Both of his examples (lines
from Diane Ward and Barrett Watten) create or slide through disjunctions
in the language. Disjunctions of desire (which are the other sort of
disjunctions that interest me) do not exist in or mirror language in
either case. I suppose I reject the coherence a transparency might
suppose. Disjunctions of my desiring might prompt me to narrativize
either effect. I could say that Watten provokes a more cinematic
response as though each sentence were a frame through which I view a
world. If I were to go on about what he has done, I might try to
distinguish a super-realism from the easy automatism of surrealism.
Surely I will not be longing for one phrase that has the power to cut
through my silences. Instead, I will follow the motion, impeded and
impelled in my flight by the instinct to read as clues lines that I'd
best (it is my hunch) unfold--and they do sustain attention as they
unfold.

so i might say that Watten's lines are an example of extensive, serial,
and continuously unfolding language, working effectively against my
desire for closure, diverging again and again, and thereby compelling my
attention. I do still admit to that desire to narrativize. I think
Silliman referred to it as the principle of "evisagement" way back in
The New Sentence.

Diane's lines are more intriguing to me. I requote two:
"Dark windows in which a list followed by facts us erupt
     chilling comparing."

Now it is possible that the above could fit into a series such as
Watten's, but my impulse is not to follow divergent serial
possibilities. Issues of subjectivity seem paramount here. I can
successfully narrativize an "erupt"-ed subjectivity. I seem to know more
fully what this is about. It is some musical dissonance that echoes with
my own sense of perhaps seeing myself erupted--compared, chilled, raw.
There is no sliding beyond this for me, but a circling back.

I could use a lot of different adjectives to describe the different
effects of each passage. I do not think that distinguishing between
disjunctions at the level of phrase or sentence is especially helpful. I
do think that each writer has knowingly played their language, managed
the effect of it so as to catch, frame, stress a pulse and in each case
my instinct to narrativize both sustains my attention and also takes
something away from my ability to hear.

I hazard that I am hearing a vision, subject to different turmoils and
pacing inexorably in the case of Watten's lines. I feel that I am at a
recurring and highly sensitive sticking point when I listen to Ward.

Whenever my 21-month old hears applause on the television or radio, he
says "yaaay" and claps.  I learn living from him, so I'd like to give a
big "yaaay" to Don Wellman and Mike Magee for concretizing the discussion.
I found both their posts useful, specific, and helpful, although as I
understand it Henry is at least in part calling for a pluralism which I
too support, so I'm all with Henry on this point.  Yaaay also to Mike
Magee for disagreeing with Henry on the smaller point, i.e., Yeats/Pound
dichotomy; Stone Cottage is a great book and a similar dichotomy, Pound/
Stevens, as outlined by Marjorie Perloff was roundly critiqued by John
Timberman Newcomb in Wallace Stevens and Literary Canons and then later by
me, in a quick'n dirty fashion, in my essay on Perloff in Diacritics oh
more than a year ago.

Posts like these make the signal/noise ratio on this list worth
bearing. Soon I might add signal, but for the moment I remain

Part of the noise,

One good thing to want (and I wanted it more than a pineapple) is Bill's
new book _Works & Days_ (Hard Press/The Figures), a sort of cracked

The Barnes papers are the University of
Maryland, College Park in the Special
Collections. There you will find anything
she'd been working on. There are numerous
poems in that collection, but each has been
written over, crossed out, deleted, revised,
crossed out, written over again, etc. that
it would take a true textual scholar to
come up with anything. And frankly, the
poetry is just not as interesting as her
other works. But then, that's my opinion
about it.

I agree with you here, Mark, with  a slightly different twist: is not
part of the agenda of the dreaded an attempt to add to/modify/detract
from the communal language - I know that it is this for me among other
intentions.  I also know too well that the songs and rhythmic
communications by my teenage kids is an attempt in some ways to
subvert my establllished place. - perhaps this is why disjunction
is often seen as threatening in poetry?

Charles,
     You find me talking before acting as I have not yet come up with a
way of translating these things to the printed page (and may never be able
to.).  The examples here are not the only ones out there as you can see,
for example, with a visit to the writings scratchpad:
http://www.burningpress.org/wreyeting/ which is well worth a visit by
anyone interested in this area.  I don't lay claim to be the only one
working in this direction in print or hypertext/visual poetry.

     In many of the work I have been doing lately (generally a group
of linked smaller pieces or pages) the reader can construct their
own poem in a variety of ways by the way they traverse the links,
layers, and directions.  In several areas words and citations are
present at times and then covered at other times in the animation.
I am currently experimenting with timing issues: words and images
appear at different intervals - at times so fast the reader can get
frustrated by or enjoy the amount of time the material is there.  I
have been looking at the Russian Futurists and other visual/collage/
poem-painting stuff and welcome suggestions as to other sources.

     Things I currently have in progress are at
http://members.home.net/trbell/motheran.htm
http://members.home.net/trbell/motheran.htm
                                comments welcome.

My experience constructing these works is here or there in the work.  What
is your experience reading them this way or that way?

    I am involved in a project http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~rswillco/PH/
where participants will be able to modify pages and poems done by others
and I'm sure it's not theonly one of it's kind - I suspect that the day
will come soon when someone can post a poem to let readers make actual
changes.

m,
   I think what yoou say here articulates very well what I may have been
struggling with when I said anything about fear or avoidance of the
disjunctive (if I did say anything along those lines).  Stepping back or
away from _conscious_ responsibility raises the discussion to higher
ground.

Dear friends--for the next three years I will be chair of the creative writing
program in the English department at UH; because this is not a job I've held
before, I'm writing to solicit suggestions from any of you who have held
similar positions, within or without the academy.  Please feel free to tell me
what worked for you and what didn't.  How did you deal with the almost
inevitable tensions between creative writers and critics?  How did you
increase interest in experimental writing?  (The emphasis here, though we
don't have an MFA, has been on MFA type work, and one of the primary fears has
been of theory in any of its guises, and this is only one of the stories,
since the tensions between local writers and the academy have also been
strong.)  What did you do to increase interest and activity among graduate
students?  Undergrads?  What sources of money did you find?  Any comments are
more than welcome.

Let me also say that, even though there is not a lot of money presently to
bring writers out here in the current long state-wide recession, that there
are local reading series that pay modestly, and there are audiences for poetry
(Juliana Spahr and Bill Luoma and Gabe Welford and Steve Carll are now here
all the time).  The local writing scene is fractious, fascinating, and
important to the culture and politics of the entire state and region.  If
you're on the list and you're going to visit Hawai`i, please let us know.
Anyone planning to visit in mid-September should attend the festival of island
writing, which will feature many local poets and fiction writers, as well as
Kamau Brathwaite, Sia Figel, and others.

Thanks in advance,

Susan Schultz

Talk about ahistorical finger pointing! Yes, working conditions in the
academy are worsening, but it's a load of crap to try to blame this on
"developments" in the steel and auto industries. And from your final
sentence it seems that you're not blaming "developments," but rather
those working class people who could have built a "true labor movement."
First of all, wake up! Ever heard of the UPS strike? The organizing was
masterful. And what about the 40,000 rank and file construction workers
who recently took over midtown Manhattan? These are great examples of
the resurgence of the American Labor Movement.

To borrow from an old adage, convenience has bred apathy on the part of
college professors for some time. Part-timers and adjuncts are currently
leading the charge in organizing on college campuses. Get involved. All
workers are under attack and it's not possible to improve conditions or
hold onto past gains without fighting back.

And, you know, this whole "academy" discussion was started by my
observations about experimental poetry no longer being "outside" the
academy. Interesting that this has spurred such defensiveness on the
part of academics. I don't think anyone's point was that academics, or
the academy itself, is "bad;" that's simply too reductive, and not the
point in any case.

Agreed without hesitation that canonization applies "property rights,"
as it were, even to Langpo works.  Yet I thought you had been talking
about the "elitism" or "esotericism," as you would have it, of such
texts-- NOT about the social effects of critics' uses of them.  Have I
misunderstood you?  And in any case, how would such a process be
substantively different whether the poet is Yeats or Bob Perelman?  I
don't see how this is relevant in the context of the issues you were
raising.

As for language as communal-- well, it is a shared system of signs,
isn't it?  We could go back & forth on this point from now til the end
of time & probably bore the rest on the list to tears.

I'm sorry if I mischaracterized your response to disjunctive poetry
(you'll note I tried to be careful to qualify my assertion), but you
have to admit you have tried to come off as attacking disjunction-- just
as you sign this recent post "your favorite reactionary curmudgeon."
I'm sure your stance is more complicated than you can easily represent
in a post or two, but you also seem to go out of your way to bait the
"pro-disjunctionists" (as if there were such a thing).  You can't have
it both ways.

"What if postmodern perspectives & techniques do not accomplish the
writer's point of view?"  Then bully for you, as Frank O'Hara said.  I
don't see anybody, least of all myself, logging on to the list to tell
Henry Gould how he should write a poem.  Yet I have to say I feel a
little brow-beaten at times if some of the enthusiasms you champion
sound boring to me PERSONALLY, in terms of my own practice (not what you
or anyone else should like).  "But what if coming from the WRITER'S
position, these modes of composition are simply NO LONGER INTERESTING?
Do not reflect the goals of the writer?"  But there isn't just one "the
writer"-- maybe this gets back to that "simplistic" communality of
language after all.  So let's all agree to write just what interests us,
okay?-- & know full well that others, doing the same, will be different.

Now what would be so elitist about that?

grateful to don wellman and michael magee for (re)posting lines and
offering some commentaries.  whether this amounts to defending the
ramparts of the innovative (henry to michael) vis a vis different
(presumably outmoded) paradigms of writing -- nothing that can be
fruitfully revisited is outmoded.

don's take on ward's lines (anybody out there got the whole poem?)

        Dark windows in which a list followed by facts us erupt
                chilling comparing

which find subjectivity pertinent here (certainly also in the lee ann
brown poem as michael points out), to which i would add epistemolgical
concerns as well, how affect confronts kinds of experience.  whereas a
list need not be factual but rather a paratactic stacking up of items
dependent on context for any kind of referential grounding, facts are
purportedly verifiable or objective and equally context-dependent, though
their status as facts masks that very dependency.  these mixed levels of
experience erupt us (subjects acted upon, social constructivism) and at
the same time we erupt the empirical concatenation (active subjects,
semiotic rupture into the symbolic).  both are chilling: brute experience
and the subject's encounter with it.  as is the comparing, of the list and
facts (not to mention the dark windows), of experience and rupture.

i think karen mac cormack's lines are working on a similar level, which
was why i initially put them together, tho without elaborating, which i
will try here (i give the whole stanza):

        The point isn't just to changing points needs it
        overblown more than complex guarantee crescendo exceeds
        advance created appearance covert treatment

we're almost beginning in the midst of a discussion.  i'm tempted to hear
the 11th thesis on feurbach here, "philosophers have only interpreted the
world, the point however is to change it," tho i wouldnt insist on it cuz
we're quickly swept in other directions.  but i can't stop rethinking that
first line because of all the different senses of "point": geometry,
space, time, jist, indicator.  one (sense of?) point cannot be made to
link to or index another because they are always changing.  but not just
changing.  necessarily.  is there an index to/of necessity?  perhaps the
whole project of aligning, connecting points of spatial, experiential,
argumentative reference -- call it cognitive mapping --  must, needs be
overblown.  that is overblown because complex is too euphemistic a way of
putting it, to clean and unproblematic.  overblown renders the necessity
of cognitive mapping as puffed up hollow distorted and untenable as it
is.  certainly exceeds my attempt here to reign it in.  but perhaps
parallels a kind of experiential rupture found in ward's lines...

I first met Bob Hass in Buffalo in 1970 when he was studying with John Logan
and I've liked the man (and his work) ever since.

If my paternal grandfather had not been adopted and given the name Emerald
Silliman (the Silliman family, starting with the first brothers, Daniel and
Thomas, who came to Connecticut out of Berne, Switzerland, in the 1600s,
started a tradition of adoption that continues to this day, making the name
one that contains an enormous genetic diversity, but one that also means
that many a cousin has no shared DNA with one another), I would be Ron
McMahon today.

Now, being the oldest living human (I turn 52 today, one year for each card
in the deck) to have been named for the 40th president of the United States
is a more complicated and dubious distinction. Even Reagan Jr. is younger
than that.

But, as I wrote to Bob Corbett yesterday, Pound is unthinkable without
Yeats. So is David Bromige, for that matter (Cf. A Final Mission in _The
Ends of the Earth_, Black Sparrow '68).

And I always thought that the phrase O'Canada was a salute to that nation's
Irish heritage,

        sure and havent I been after telling Ron this for decades now, tis
time to come out of that Celtic Twilight into the sun of common day. Same
for Bob O'Hass also, him and Ron being alike as two peas in the pod. The
mystifications of "Meditation at Lagunitas" smells of the druid censer no
less than those of "Ketjak" and "Tjanting." Appears that not until the
Liffey flows with Guinness shall we hear the plain speech of common sense

been hushed up). On a seperate but related issue, I would love for Randolph

I think what I was saying is that though postmodernists may consider
themselves to be "freeing language itself" from stereotypes of the
narcissistic undivided monistic self, the social effect or outcome of
this approach is to accumulate disparate chunks of dictionary language
- prospectin the vocabulary - stakin your claim, puttin up your
shingle, callin in them hifalutin postmod scholar-lawyers to cover yer
tenure, flashin yer anthology... in other words the social effect of
the project is undifferentiable from other professional academic styles.
But I agree with you this is not exactly relevant & is sort of unfair &
typical email bombast.  oh well.

I've been trying to satirize a reigning style or approach.  I apologize
for going over the top & browbeating & boring people.  As you can see I'm
at the sated stage now - this happens to bulls after a few days of noisy
rampaging.  The actual poets - the people who delight in words & poetry
& make something themselves, unique & independent & substantial - continue
to do their work, many of them working below the elitist level of
academic libraries & internet access & office jobs, others just avoiding
most of that because they are creative & clever.  It would be truly
reactionary to deny the impact of all the work very roughly flowing from
say a "Pound Stein Zukofsky Howe" matrix (purely imaginary construct).
The creme de la creme currently of that stream is possibly in the mag
GERM, the new issue of which exhibits a lot of the faults & strengths
of the reigning approach.  Maybe when I've read it more thoroughly I can
be more specific.

I guess what I was getting at was that I was SKETCHING some bases for
an alternative style, so that it won't do simply to recount "how to read"
"disjunctive" work - I'm suggesting writing & reading something else
entirely - you certainly have every right to find it not worth pursuing -
but I don't quite agree with David Kellogg & others who simply cite
the "Stone Cottage" book or how close Yeats & Pound were.  Of course they
were, & influenced each other to a great degree - but they also distinguished
their approaches quite clearly, I think.  Sorry I can't quote any evidence
at the moment but I believe both Yeats & Pound specifically pointed out
where they parted ways.

To summarize once more: my alternative position is this: it is possible
to pursue an innovative poetry which aims for a direct synthesis of
speech rhythms, metrics, imagery, and meaning; which maintains the
syntax of "ordinary speech" while changing it, defamiliarizing it at the
same time; which is an "art which hides art" by concealing layers of
feeling & meaning beneath such a "non-disjunctive" surface; which even
speaks "in propria persona" - or its mask - the autobriographical self -
rather than a neutral non-voice or a mask of marginality.  And this
general approach is closer to the path Yeats took rather than Pound,
whose drive to "break the pentameter" and so forth has continued on its
centrifugal path for almost a century.  I am not saying that we must
obsess about Yeats or Pound as paradigms, or that disjunctive work is
no good, or that such innovative poetry must sound like Robert Frost
or something suitably antique.  I am saying that I have a philosophical
quibble with much of the ideological foundations of postmodern poetry,
which I've gestured toward in some essays in Witz & Mudlark, and that's
been part of my motive for running to the Russkies & slamming the
creme de la creme.  - Henry Gould

[end quote]

It's worth being reminded that the poem-text is a wilderness requiring
patient application & care. Let us all have faith in poetry and give it
an opportunity to be heard.  Especially those of us inured to Tennyson
& AE Housman, who like a jolly rhyme & a quick message before lunch;
who want a poet like Vachel Lindsay to arise & speak to the people.
These dizjunk chaps are awfully mind-boggling - what's it all about?

Wake up yerself...

I'm a working class person who's been deeply involved in the labor
movement for over 20 years.

Yeah, in fact the movement was sold out by what i refer to as the
sweetheart leadership, who allowed red-baiting and
the-post-war-boom-will-raise-all-boats to convince 'em to sell out the
militancy we needed.

Get a grip and look at things clearly.  We need to be critical and not

While the the rhetorical mode of the "salvage operation" is tired, as
David K. points out with great wit, does that mean that it is not worth
doing? Perhaps in some other rhetorical mode? I for one appreciated Maria
Damon's chapter on Bob Kaufman--despite the fact that it fell into a
pattern of "rescue this neglected poet."

That supposedly hipper but actually simply "not interested in poetry" cult
studs were less interested in Duncan/Spicer/Kaufman says something about
them, Maria. The revealing phrase for me in your post about reception of
your work was "to the extent they were interested at all." What WOULD
interest these "cult studs"?!!! I would much rather be a poetry stud.

It's a relief of sorts to hear someone say so, OR  its not our dirty little secret anymore. I've often wondered about the 'Trauma of being poeticized'; I don't know if its a question of 'failure of nerve' or 'piety' to (in effect) choose or not choose to discuss 'trauma' in regards to 'being poeticized'. I don't think it is. Poetry is , in a sense, a blessing and a curse.(Hey, if I'm wrong here, tell me. I can take it. I need to know.)

 I was quite interested in the discussion last month with re: Hannah Weiner and the talk Maria Damon will be giving in October(?). This seems to be another aspect to this question. I wanted to mention the book _Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History_ by Cathy Caruth as an important disclosure, and isnt being poeticized  to be exposed to whatever is 'unclaimed' in one's life, what Giorgio Agamben calls 'the possession of what cannot be enjoyed, and the enjoyment of what cannot be possessed.'?

When 'the beams of my house' are not so sturdy anymore, and philosophy is unmasked as a form of homesickness, and well, I want to check the view again out the 'north window', am I so sure the window frame is intact, or that I can point in that direction any longer, or that it even matters anymore calling this, or it, or us 'noble' anymore?

I don't know if this is necessarily what Bromige is talking about...It's hard to get the hang of it, and that's another dirty secret. I don't know if I will or will not get the hang of it. How much longer do I have. Please check your clocks. Or are the colors I'm flying 'too loud'?

Henry, you predicate your search for an "alternative" innovative poetry,
one that is not also based on disjunctive poetics, on a "general approach
closer to the path Yeats took than Pound."  But in your careful description
of the stylistics qualities of your alternative (your latest posts disregard
"content" or the "form/content" issue, which may or may not be helpful in
this instance)--you seem to leave out the relationship to a transcendental
term(s) that Yeats predicated his poetics on, as did Duncan or Allen Grossman
after him.  Perhaps your most recent polemic ends up too quickly at claims
about "how" to write a poem without addressing "why" write a poem, and this
emphasis doesn't seem closer to Yeats at all.  I assume that the stakes are
higher than merely asserting your freedom from (the fiction of) a hegemony
of disjunction.  The energy field for Yeats was not delimited to self/language/
experience, and even adding history/social organization to this string will
not be sufficiently encompassing.  If you do not leave out the philosophical,
or rather the theological, ground of Yeats' figures, then your discourse
will need to get into much more than stylistics...no?

Yeats' practice was more traditional and conservative than Pound's in
many ways.  It was Pound's influence that pushed Yeats to strive for
a "harder", more "modern" voice, but he retained his original approach
to language & form for the most part, it seems to me.  It's not the fact
of tradition that appeals to me: it's the emphasis on full,
direct statement; the sense of a poem as a complete development and
movement.  This too will seem gratingly traditionalist.  As I said in
previous post, I have a philosophical quibble with [what I think of] as
postmodernism; but I don't want to rehash lengthy comments of years ago
on the list which bored a lot of people the first time.  In the Witz &
Mudlark essays I have tried to get at them in an indirect way.  I bring
forward the concept of wholeness as an ontological reality at least as
real as division & fragmentation; I emphasize the "idea" of the Person
as something slighted or made subservient by ideology on both left &
right; & I talk about the traditional idea of the human as the image of
god and the culture of the icon in Eastern European Christianity as
realities which favor art-making in general. These are some of the notions
that underlie my argument with postmodernism & my attempt to question the
sort of "automatic marginality" which seems to flow from sophisticated
contemporary poetics.  - Henry Gould

Marvelous stuff, Hazel.  I've only started to explore here, but it does
illustrate what I was saying about mutual "auther"-reader poem construction,
along with some pitfalls inherent apparently in the process - e.g. need for
sophisticated hardware/software.  You have done a marvelous job of avoiding
another common problem with this work - I didn't detect a fascination with
the means of production and fancy tricks, something that is found too often.

The cure for poetic trauma is not to be found in a pill or a bottle but
might be written out of [!this is writing OUT OF, NOT confessional], might
be helped through thherapy or mentoring, or taken as an "as-if" fact of
life.  If I were to say this applies to me does this than become
"confessional" and automatically bad?  What a weird world we inhabit.

Interesting list, Douglas. Just as an americano guage or is that gauge?  i'd
say i am familiar with over half the names on that list. that i have read
works by about one third of those folk. and have met perhaps between one
eighth to one quarter of them.  randolph healy is very cute as i remember.
and Harriet has a good nose.

some of this (acquainting) is a result of knowing stephen rodefer who taught
some at cambridge. and the rest is from going to romana huk's new hampshire
thing a ways back and paying attention to this list. i think the perception
that those in the new world are ignorant of their contemporaries in the old
world no longer holds. people actually have each other's addresses. the
inevitable can't be stopped.

so yes, even in light of the current saturation bombing from anthology hell, i
am looking forward to the other thing. it is the only one i will actually go
out and buy.

best,

Bill Luoma

Jack Kimball has asked me to post a list of some interesting names in current
Brit poetry.  I'll do my best to give you, say, 50, very much off the top of
my head, with absolutely no order of importance implied by the list.

You see, what I'm really asked to do here is create an anthology via the
immediacy of e-mail.  This can't be a list of that kind: it would take
research and fuller memory recall.  I've probably forgotten my oldest friend!
At present, most US views of the British scene are somewhat narrowed by the
preoccupations both of US poets and British poets who have so far compiled the
names or arrange the conferences.  Nothing especially wrong with that, but
below is a fairly non-partisan list from someone who hasn't lived in Britain
for nearly two decades and will miss quite a bit, I expect.  May other Brits
correct me.

A "T" means I have at least some contact or channel, sometimes close but not
always.   If Jack or anyone else is interested in following up on a name and I
can help, I'd be glad to (within reason).

*** Man strung up on meat hooks sets new world record

John Kamakaze, Scotland's self-styled "Prince of Pain," set a
stomach-churning world record Wednesday when he spent 15 minutes
suspended in mid-air by meat hooks imbedded in his back. A smiling
Kamakaze, with eight meat hooks stuck in his back, and one in each
leg, said pain was all in the mind. "It didn't hurt a bit. It's just
a case of mind over matter," Kamakaze said afterwards. "I'm perfectly
happy. The only thing that hurts is a blister on my foot from walking
about too much yesterday." Unsurprisingly, the stunt has never before
been attempted. See

*** Man squirts paint on Rembrandt portrait in London

A man squirted yellow paint over a Rembrandt self-portrait at
London's National Gallery this week but the work has been cleaned up
and is now back on show, a gallery spokeswoman said Wednesday. The
attack on the picture of the artist at the age of 63 happened on
Tuesday. "It hasn't sustained any permanent damage," the spokeswoman
said. A 26-year-old unemployed man has been charged with criminal
damage over the attack, for which the motive was unclear. "This
happens about once every 10 years," the spokeswoman said. "We
normally nip these things in the bud." (Reuters)

*** French language watchdog growls at U.S. feminists

One of the staunchest defenders of the French language has found a
new ememy in his never-ending battle against linguistic pollution -
American feminists. Maurice Druon, secretary of the hallowed Academie
Francaise that guards the language as a national treasure, grumbled
on Wednesday about a recent fashion for "feminizing" titles which he
said was an American aberration infiltrating French via Quebec. "Do
we know where this fashion of feminizing titles was born? Certainly
not in Canada, but in the United States. Canada was only contaminated
through geographical proximity." See

A Gil Ott Issue
PhillyTalks invites you to contribute to an upcoming
issue on the work of Gil Ott. Ott's poetry, essays,
Singing Horse Press, dedication to community and arts
education in Philadelphia have been of great importance
in encouraging formally innovative, socially aware
writing practice. We seek responses to Gil's poetry and
critical work, and are interested as well in commentary of
a more personal nature (anecdote, reminiscence, etc.).
Deadline: November 1st, 1998. The issue will feature an
interview with the poet, conducted by Kristen Gallagher,
Heather Starr and Kerry Sherin. For a Gil Ot
bibliography, difficult-to-find or out-of-print work,
contact Kristen Gallagher at 215-387-0651 or
kristing@pobox.upenn.edu.

Future Issues
Featured talks include Rodrigo Toscano & Alan Gilbert,
Brian Kim Stefans & Fred Wah, Rod Smith & Bruce
Andrews, Susan Stewart & Bob Perelman, Steven
Farmer & Peter Gizzi, and others! There will be a John
Wieners Celebration issue, with Rachel Blau DuPlessis
and Alan Davies, among others, available soon. The
March 1998 talk by Ammiel Alcalay and Tom Mandel,
moderated by Joshua Schuster, will be available in early
September, together with a chapbook by Alcalay, _A
Masque in the form of a Cento_, published by hole
books. Contribute to the next set of talks by subscribing -
- the second response issue is due next summer. $12 for
the next five issues; donations acccepted. Please make
your cheque out to Louis Cabri.

Subscribers
Due to a fatal laptop mishap, some subscribers' addresses
have been lost. PLEASE email me your address if by the
first week of September you have not received a
newsletter! Sorry! I will try my best to contact you
myself, as memory serves.

Thanks to Peter Q. for his sad and lovely words on Charles Watts.

We will miss him on this list, and we will hardly know how to get by
without him in Vancouver.

You will remember that Charles did yeoman work on the Blaser conference
here a couple years ago. He was currently working on the bpNichol symposium
for this Fall.

If you are lucky enough to have his book _Bread and Wine_, have a read.

Charles, along with Gene Bridwell, was custodian of the Contemporary
Literature Collection at Simon Fraser University, a wonderful place.

And one support group is gathered to speak the full bitterness of poetry
abuse in the latest issue of the (uh oh) PSA Journal.  Charles
Bernstein, Robert Creeley, Marie Ponsot, Leslie Scalapino and others
write about their "first loves" in poesy.

Bernstein: "I remember, as if it were another life, those nights that
Khlebnikov was my babysitter.  After giving me a hot plate of Campbell's
Vegetarian Baked Beans with cut-up franks, and then tucking me into bed,
he would perform 'Incantation by Laughter' . . . Although I also admired
his 'supersaga' _Zangezi_, which he wrote while bouncing me on his knee
(or so it has often seemed), I was definitely partial to his shorter
_zaum_ poems . . ."

Creeley: "So what I remember finally is what I have to--because I can't
ever forget.  It's the eighth grade?  Miss Stolte, blonde, slim, quite
tall, quick almost ironic manner, desperate in a way I can now
recognize, lonely, disdaining, speedy, begins to read.  We have badgered
her mercilessly until she yields.  But she must enjoy her powers?  She
is reading a poem by Alfred Noyes, which I find wondrous, arousing,
sensual beyond anything I can put words to . . . "

Please, Mr. Presjnar, I have no interest in attacking you as a person.
Rather, I take issue with your ideas--and still take issue with them. I
think you need to differentiate between union bureaucrat "leaders," and
rank and file unionism in your gloss of the labor movement. And what
about the UPS strike? And the NYC construction workers? Should we just
ignore that and continue to bemoan the state of Labor Movement? I prefer
to recognize the tremendous energy and militancy happening on the part
of the rank and file.

And you're simply not going to convince me that past failures (and yes
there have been failures) on the part of union leaders in the steel and
auto industries (your examples) are responsible for building the boat
academics find themselves in. I still think they need to get off their
butts and fight for their rights like everyone else--and help to build
equality for workers. And increasing numbers are doing just that.

Oh so "mealymouthed". . .

I remain

truly yours,

Kathy Lou

Hear hear.  The poet wants free rein (or reign) but the territorialists,
who are not necessarily or usually the originators in any school, are
out in force.  Why?  Because marking territory, pissing on the snow you
own, is a form of marketing.

So I'd disagree only about "cowardice and selfishness," unless we want
to call Ted Berrigan, for example, cowardly and selfish for reading what
he pleased.  Poets are magpies--acquisitive and curious.  But camp
followers and plodders are always out on patrol, making the world safe
for dullness.

Kathy,

At least a few academics have started to get off of their butts, or are
at least sitting propped up on one elbow. See _Workplace_, an electronic
journal devoted to academic labor issues that's sponsored by the MLA
Graduate Student Caucus:

http://www.workplace-gsc.com/

See too the Palinurus site, devoted to "teaching the humanities in a
restructured world," which I know I've mentioned here before:

http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/liu/palinurus/

Having been to distance education conferences myself (and listened to
the rhetoric and ogled the pie charts), I very much believe that there's
no more vital an issue for academics of all ranks, not least because the
assault on tenure, the increasing reliance on part-time and non-degreed
labor, and so forth are all integral to some of the more influential
distance ed. scenarios. Matt

And the Independent Prosecutor then asked:

Wasn't it Rachel Loden who wrote "My Wicked, Wicked Ways"?
Wasn't it Robert Creeley who first denigrated the word "about" in
relation to poetry? (It happened traveling in lovely company, as I
remember).

The hands that rocked the cradle, indeed!

I'm trying to remember the first wound that poetry inflicted, but "A
Child's Garden of Verses" by Robert Stevenson seemed pretty innocuous at
the time . . .

Absolutely (a word I seldom use), Randolph, and so elegantly put. Why it
has to be stated so often is a puzzle. The rush to judgment of literary
taste is as stupid, every bit, as Why wait for the Law let's string 'em up
now. I should think everybody has had the experience of later coming to
love a writing which they at first distrusted if not detested. (As of
coming to love a person one at first detested). (And then, later again, of
experiencing a further reversal).

Part of the problem is that one actually _can_ know better, not only than
oneself at a previous stage, but than another person who is at that
previous stage. That is, one now knows more concerning this activity. And
then, it can bug the hell out of us to have to put up with an ass, braying.
Then, one's caution with regard to one's own judgments looks uncalled-for.
Let us imagine for a moment that Helen Vendler knows more about Post-WW2
British poetry than "we" do. How impatient she must be, with us!

Still, one would like to see the evidence, if not of her taste forming,
then of her research--the reading she has done in the field. Where she
bogged down with Allen Fisher. Where she found Wallace Stevens preferable
to Jeremy Prynne. What her readerly approach has been, to Tom Raworth,
Maggie O'Sullivan, Wendy Mulford.

Absent such, one has difficulty trusting that she has done her research (as
much into oneself, such research, as into the field; as much, but not,
more) even in the fields where she _is_ known as critic and canon-maker.
Maybe even there, she's a merely charismatic well-situated person with
intimidating powers of persuasion, whose preferences chanced to fit into a
social or political agenda among the well-connected. We are to blame, after
all, for according more respect to those who teach at Harvard than those
who teach at Highland Community College, or those who don't teach at all,
if we accord such respect simply because Harvard is where they do teach,
and this or that prestigious university press, where they do publish.

"The best lack all conviction, the worst are full of passionate intensity"
--isnt that how Yeats phrases it? The passions of some persons' convictions
have enslaved large portions of humanity.Some of whom, at some level,
presumably wished to be enslaved : "Let Joe do it." We are bowled over by
such single-mindedness, even where there isn't that much of _mind_ in it.
We want to be told what to do, like, choose. Experts soothe. Therefore,
ignore experts?  But part of the difficulty, again, is, there _can_ be
expertise. _We_ don't want know-nothings.

Hence the battlefields of criticism. And poetry wars. Throughout History,
time and again, the mildest-mannered of women and men have had to take arms
against a sea of passionate intensity, or be drowned. Where poetry is the
prize, Randolph Healy's modesty and patience, with their glimpse of fine
sarcasm, may be the keenest weapon of them all. Otherwise, breaking arms
and legs will have to do. But the (fill in name of favorite enemy here)
keep a-comin' . Wherever a favorite intelligence lodges in our midst, the
stupidity which is its shadow, fastens upon it like loathsome flies.

And too, the times change, and we change. . . with them or against them.
Blush for past passions! For they fail to recognize you.

Thank you, Rachel, for a posting whose humor shows how to read my own
posting : as T.R.Bell suggests to me, I speak "as-if." But in no way
attempt to make fun of incest survivors, nor to cheapen their experience.
More of this, perhaps, subsequently.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn from Rachel's post of the PSA Journal's
gathering of threads from the 4 corners & ends of the earth, on this topic
of "first loves" in poetry. The passage from Charles Bernstein I found
particularly engaging, and for those like myself who cannot get enough of
the Master in this familiar, dis/respectful, jiving mode (he speaks of
Khlebnikov as telling him bedtime poems), may I suggest my own work, "Six
of One, Half a Dozen of the Other" where one reads of the author's
encounter with Freud ("Facing my father he said, Not to worry. Then,
patting my head, he added : later, he vill remember ziss differently") and
D.H.Lawrence ("who should never have had to be a teacher. He wanted to be a
poet, & he had too much sympathy with our condition to be of any use") and
James Joyce ("who had been a famous cricketer in his day, though in later
years he never left the attic where he'd sit day in day out going over old
scorecards from his immense collection & reworking the games on paper to
see why they hadn't come out differently").

Unknown, I expect, to anybody under 40, these pieces may be found in _The
Falcon  13_ for Fall 1976, and then in _My Poetry_, The Figures Press,
1980. (This book was the first of a series of titles: _My Life_, _My
Pleasures_ ,in Berkeley that year; I am delighted to find this original
couching re-surfacing today with _My Symptoms_ and the upcoming  Charles'
_My Way_ .)

Back to the beginning: to me (as I suspect, to Charles) the truth is a made
thing; Reality's existence is read in many ways, and one reality of being a
poet is that of a love/hate relationship with poetry. "Poetry that opens my
lips and shuts my mouth." Poetry that inspires emulation. That shuts my
mouth with itself. Poetry that, like a father, can point out that one owes
one's life to him--a life that is not sound pay-back coin if it can only
repeat. These are realities of our experience; in ways they are analagous
to the double-bind of incest. I hope this makes matters plainer.

Imagine a hydrahead: Ashberybloomvendler.

Imagine a nation of academic journals dedicated to securing tenure for
professional poets who run contests and give awards and so on.

Imagine a poetry counter-culture of shallow roots, a-historical hokum and
spiritual posturing.

Then think about Grand Fenwick.

There's more poetry in one saying of the Sermon on the Mount than in all
the writings of Pound, Olson, Duncan, Creeley, Palmer, etc. put together.

i agree; which is one reason, to refer to my earlier somewhat self-absorbed
post, i find much of the "school"-mongering that passes for scholarship in
poetry circles to be not very stimulating; it doesn't open out into a
larger view of the world...

Thought I'd interoduce a couple quotes from my morning's reading which
seem relevant to our recent Henry-ignited discussions, both from Burke's
essay, "The Rhetoric of Hitler's Battle," Burke's reading of Mein Kampf as
symbolic action:

1) "There are other ways of burning books than on the pyre - and the
favorite method of the hasty revieer is to deprive himself and his readers
by inattention...If the reviewer but knocks off a few adverse
attitudinizings and calls it a day, with a guarantee in advance that his
article will have a favorable reception among the decent members of our
population, he is contributing more to out gratification than to our
enlightenment."

2) "It is part of the genius of the great leader [read Adolph] to make
adversaries of different fields appear as always belonging to one category
only, because to weak and unstable characters the knowledge that there are
various enemies will lead only too easily to incipient doubts  as to their
own cause."

O what joy to find myself compared to Hitler!  I was hoping for Reagan,
though...  maybe the next stormtrooper can try that one.  Luckily these
screens are pellet-proof.  Comparing somebody to Hitler is a good
way to marginalize your opponent - hope everybody will remember that
as we wade further into the poetics swamp for today.

But seriously there, Mike - I don't think I've been tossing off
negative attitudes to the converted, like some established reviewer
putting down books.  I have been negative, sarcastic, controversial
about some things - mostly popular poetic styles that have held sway
for about the same length of time as I've been writing myself (30 yrs).
Yes, my resentment and ressentiment & so on is there, and that is
a negative thing & a limitation.  No, I don't have all the answers or
think I do - I just like to be controversial & outrageous because it's
fun & stimulates discussion.  But maybe there's too much of me & of
that, I admit.  Secondly I don't think I've lumped enemies together
etc. in the way Burke describes.  So I don't see how that applies,
if that's what you're trying to do.  But if what I say scares you,
makes you worried that maybe I've done irreparable damage to poetic
reputations or careers, made it harder for you to enjoy poetry,
well, just say so.  Others have.  I don't mean to roil up the
clubhouse so much - everybody okay out there?  Free spirits & all?
Gaily traipsing through the fields of Zephyr or whatever?
I'll shut up now, somebody can send in a positive review of something,
cheer us all up. - Henry G.

I should have anticipated Henry's equating Burke-on-Hitler to
Magee-on-Burke (below) and said somehing more specific in my posting of
quotes.  For the record, I think there is a key difference between Hitler
and Henry, as well as between causal critics of Hitler and
Henry-as-critic: the difference lies in the fact that Henry has no
"guarantee in advance" that he will get a "favorable reception" - indeed
in most cases precisely the opposite.  In fact, one of Henry's enduring
roles on the list, to my mind, is to make sure that the list doesn't fall
into a cycle of tacit self-gratification, which is why I'm generally
happy to see his name pop up in all its permutations on my message board,
& happy to respond when I have something to say.  Henry's saving strength
is his awareness that he is in fact in a conversation, albeit a rather
combative one.  So, peace brother.

Now, that said, I would argue that Henry's rhetoric often functions in
such a way that it "make(s) adversaries of different fields appear as
always belonging to one category only," and that I am against such
rhetorical strategies.  Henry's motive, I would guess, couldn't be
farther away from Hitler's: and in a sense it might be as "motive-less"
as language can be, the result of a lack of knowledge regarding those
"different fields" rather than a specific wish to lump those fields
together for purposes extinguishing "the enemy."  But language has a
funny way of doing what it wants despite its originators consciousness or
lack thereof and, as such, Henry's does indeed sometimes conjur up for me
"the enemy of disjunctive poetics" which controls "The Academy" and "must
be stopped."  You see where I'm getting.   -m.

But Mike, people are always using categories.  I didn't invent the "disjunctive
 poetics" label.  People have rightly complained about the level of
abstraction in these poetics list debates - rightly, rightly - the whole
strategy of opposing Pound/Yeats on the grid synthesis/disjunction is
probably the biggest abstraction proposed yet.  But I don't think that
warrants comparing this strategy to Hitler & suggesting I'm too unread to
know or care about the differences & unique qualities of the writing out there.
When I say I have a quibble with the zeitgeist informing a lot of American
poetry the fact is I do, hard to believe as that may be; when I say I am
bored & fed up with a lot of the poetry that seems to reflect that zeitgeist
that is exactly how I feel.  It's not just boredom - it's really a sense of
exile. I think it is legitimate in the field of poetics to talk about general
trends; and I don't think using categories or abstract terms is a specifically
Hitlerian strategy.  Maybe talking too much is, I grant you that.

ead to the ever-
delayed Ph.D. thesis and his excitement over Italy and all things Italian that a
 trip last summer had
kindled. Other friends warned me otherwise about his health, so I knew what Pete
r's notice was
going to say even before I opened it, but it's hard news for us all.

Krishna and I got to know and love Charles when he insisted that we stay with hi
m for a few days of
sight-seeing after the 1985 Vancouver Poetry Festival. In addition to being a pe
rfect host and
fabulous guide, he was a gentle, brilliant, far-too modest, extraordinarily well
-read soul with the driest
sense of humor I've encountered. A rolled eye and the barest upturned smile ofte
n suggested sans
words precisely what he thought of this or that event or person.

It turned out that his life-long buddy Peter Magnani was (is) the brother of a w
oman with whom I'd
worked in the prison movement and I would encounter Charles and Peter at reading
s, particularly at
Canessa Park, when Charles came down to California for his annual visit with his
 family. More than
once this led to dinner at Brandy Ho's or Hunan during which I got to pump him f
or the latest scoop
on the Vancouver scene. Charles introduced me to the work of several of the folk
s north of the
border whose writing I follow and his opinions caused me to rethink some first i
mpressions of other
writers.

Charles first moved to Canada as a war resister in the late 1960s. I stayed at h
ome and fought my
induction notice (for seven years!) until I finally "qualified" for CO status, w
hich was how I began
doing prison movement work in the first place. We often speculated on how differ
ent our lives might
have been had either one of us taken the other's approach, or how different had
the war in Indochina
simply not happened. Charles' move was clearly Canada's gain and one more piece
of evidence (not
that any's needed) of how war wastes a nation's resources.

Charles never published very much, but his devotion to (and understanding of) th
e poetry scene was
complete. Even at this distance, I'm convinced that he was indispensible to the
worlds of poetry that
he touched, especially the scene in Vancouver, and I have no idea how we will ge
t along without him.
It will certainly be a different world.

I know that I've said and written this before, but it's worth repeating -- beyon
d the pure pleasures of
reading and writing, the greatest thing about poetry is how it permits you to me
et some wonderful,
even magical people all over the world. Charles was just such a person in my lif
e. We should treasure
and nurture each one.

Will try to salvage something from my side of the disjunct divide for the
fit though few, and will try to be brief.

Randolph Healy reminded us that "disjunctive" (new word, anybody?) poets
"put things together".  Good point.  Obviously 20th cent poetry's glories
include the leaps, the freedom, the documentary openness, the new forms,
the new contents, that Pound's big "grab bag" opened up.

So many forces & influences have pushed in a centrifugal direction.  Open
up any poem almost by bestboy Mandelstam & you find disjunction like a
natch'l born schizophrenic.  Music, science, technology, speed, relativity,
knowledge-boom...  poetry HAD to spread the net in order to
be real.  (when it wasn't ahead of the times).

People think (maybe rightly considering my snarling) I have an agenda, to turn
back the clock, to denigrate language poetry & experiment & difference.
These are or would be reactionary tactics, true enough, if that were all.
But that is not exactly the case.  All I ask is that some of you consider
the possibility that I am suggesting something positive rather than simply
tearing down.

In a nutshell I am suggesting that there is always a repressed "other side"
of any dominant cultural direction.  One other side of our current zeitgeist
of difference, otherness, disjunction, fragmentation would be world views
that recognize continuity (aesthetic, ontological), synthesis, unity-of-
being, wholeness.  The mistake is to consider these representative of
any particular cultural or political establishment & reject them out of
hand.  In my view the most radical challenge to a world order still
enslaved to political violence and organized war (thinking of Ron Silliman's
interesting note on his & C. Watts' C.O. experience during Vietnam war)
comes from religious belief: Franciscan, Buddhist, Quaker, anarchist...
While most religious philosophies long ago confronted the paradoxes of
otherness and the unknown, unlike some contemporary ideologies they do
not simply deny the existence of unity or synthesis of being.

Enough about philosophy.  Let me disjunct over to the recent issue of GERM.
I haven't read all of it yet, but I think the issue both displays some
of the tried & true techniques I criticized before (fragmentary syntax,
almost total obscurity of meaning(s)), and also quite a bit of artistry.
Beth Anderson's series of poems stands out as different from the rest I
read anyway. The most obvious difference is syntactical continuity and
stylistic consistency.  There are 4-5 poems which seem sort of Ashbery-
Mallarme, in a consistent extremely neutral tone.
Late 20th-cent symbolism:  music of language, a serious, almost
somber modern music.  As in Ashbery, it's a beautiful syntax but sort of
with the meaning hollowed out, at least the obvious meaning-packages.
The music comes to the fore - but there is this distinctive, complex
continuity & consistency of style.  Devin Johnston's sequence was
interesting too: like a Susan Howe protege, steeped in original
17-18th century texts, but also in Eliot and Crane, there's clearly
a synthetic motivation at work & an awareness of rhythm & harmony.

I am not singling these out as "approved" texts from the journal -
I am trying to point out elements of synthetic as opposed to
disjunctive composition at work.  I am trying to suggest that
syntax CAN be an integral part of structural rhythm, and that
structural rhythm CAN be put to a coherent, synthetic authorial
purpose.  And to me the original contrast of Yeats/Pound is apropos
here.

I am talking about the lexical tools of poetry & suggesting that it is
not enough to tear apart & throw into a grab bag anymore, no matter
what hoary postmodernist truisms or ideals of class/identity politics
or self-interested company histories of alternative art are brought
to bear.  I am suggesting looking for other means at work, other
motivations.  Every time you break apart a sentence, consider the
cost.  It's one more broken string on your bow.  Is it worth it?
Can you still shoot your arrows?

I feel bad that I just can't put this down but I need, again, to make an
exception: I think you're confusing "breaking apart a sentence" with
writing a sentence which some people will consider broken.  These are two
totally different things.  the first is based on an assumption that there
is such a thing as a sentence and that this thing can be accurately
recognized and measured according to certain criteria.  The second
attempts to create the definition of a sentence in the act of fashioning.
So, no, I never, ever break sentences; I simply write a different kind of
sentence (Monk's definition of his style: "How to use notes differently.
That's it.  Just how to use notes differently").  Vernacular traditions
have always recognized this possibility, and the danger of putting a
priori limits on communicative agency.  The old joke, where the liguist
says to his class, "There is no grammarical formation in which two
positives equal a negative," and someone yells from the back of the room,
"Yeah, right."  I imagine that must have given those classmates a sense of
breathing room to do their own thing.  In my own work I see lots of
possibilities for, if not "wholeness" exactly, then shared signs, or as
Robert Duncan put it, "fictive certainties" - its just that these have
less to do with the sanctioned rules of sentence construction than they do
w/ what I hear around me - or dream up - in the shape of new, liminal,
structures of "getting across," ones which I think better fit my sense of
the real, or better fit my sense of what that real should be (the utopian
commitment implicit in a belief in symbolic action).  I remember laughing
out loud the first time I hear the Beastie Boys lyric, "I got more rhymes
than J.D.'s got Salinger" - of course, JD *doesn't* have Salinger,
according to the rules of syntax, and yet he does, & I felt like I'd
gotten something of the point.  There's a *big* difference betwen just
wanting to smash stuff up and trying to find structures compatible w/ ones
evolving desires.

I'm probably jumping in at the tail end of this thread, but this last
paragraph has inspired me to say something.

To say, "every time you _break apart_ a sentence, consider the cost..."
has an assumption buried in it that a poet begins with sentences as a
frame of reference, or that a poet comes to a raw, previously written
work to break it apart.  I would also add a caution, "every time you
_form_ a sentence, consider the cost."

I have been "looking for other means at work" and I, personally, have
found that in order to touch some sort of truth in writing, I've got to
begin with nothing, a blank page, emptiness.  Of course, history,
styles, traditions, politics, personal preferences, etc. are all
swirling around in my mind and have their influences, but when I
investigate the pure physicality of writing, there is the "problem" of a
blank page (or computer screen, canvas, etc.), and then, how to _begin_.

So, I may be way off-base here, but the whole of disjunctive work has
taught me not to question the modalities that it attempts to break
apart, but to question the act of creating a work and all that that
entails.  It may be that when I write, I write a perfect sonnet.  It may
also be that when I edit it, I break it apart.  Or it also may be that I
write the broken sonnet without having written the perfect sonnet.  Or I
just write a few words and leave it at that.

"Can you still shoot your arrows?"  Assuming that I'm even here to shoot
anything, I'm not sure.  I'm still learning.  (I hope I haven't jumped
into a thread that's bigger than what I think)

--trace--

And, like other here, I want to thank Henry for asking these
questions...

Or, on the one hand, using the weight of traditional usage, perhaps even
with allowed variance, or beyond that but always with reference to accepted
usage

vs

treating language as material, being able to place a word here, a letter
there, a mark on one side, a phrase on the other, and believe that the
'sense' one makes with such strategies is at least as important/interesting
as the 'sense' one might make with more traditional usage

knowing all the while that we never entirely escape the centuries of
built-up rules and conventions governing normative language use, and
perhaps (this point is arguable) we would not want to escape such norms

but we want to make other voices/gestures/styles/arrangements possible, too
as we extend what it is we might do in a poem or other
written/sounded/projected work
as we extend how such things might be read

to me there is a good parallel in this ongoing discussion with activities
in the world of bookmaking, where some will only accept the traditional
codex form as a 'book,' while others are just busily making various
structures which still offer themselves as one kind of gathering or
another, able to be 'read'

  "The relationship of our intellect to the truth is like that of a polygon to
a circle; the resemblance to the circle grows with the multiplication of the
angles of the polygon; but apart from its being reduced to identity with the
circle, no multiplication, even if it were infinite, of its angles will make
the polygon equal to the circle.
  "It is clear, therefore, that all we know of the truth is that the absolute
truth, such as it is, is beyond our reach.  The truth, which can be neither
more nor less than it is, is the most absolute necessity, while, in contrast
to it, our intellect is possibility.  Therefore, the quiddity of things,
which is ontological truth, is unattainable in its entirety; and though it
has been the objective of all philosophers, by none has it been found as it
really is.  The more profoundly we learn this lesson of ignorance, the closer
we draw to truth itself."
- Nicolas Cusanus, OF LEARNED IGNORANCE, 1440.

The Ultimate Authority, Poeta Superbissima Osip Mandelstam, once wrote:
poetic material is language in its raw state, infinitely more raw than
speech & "literature".

This accords well with Mike, Tracy & Charles's points.  Points well taken.
Still, I would argue that boilerplate experimental poetry is made up of
either abrupt jumps between single words & partial phrases, or neutral
simple sentences - neutral in the sense of being so contextless as to mean
anything you want them to mean.  And I would suggest, and have been
suggesting, that those who want to consider themselves adventurous and
experimental might look in the direction of verbal & syntactical richness,
complexity, development, and synthesis as well as in the direction of
staccato idioms of their own devising.  There are a lot of ways to shoot
arrows.  Imagine a poetry that didn't foreground its verbal mannerisms,
but built up an organ-like presentation of communications based on
comprehensible speech patterns.

Hi Elizabeth,

I run a small poetry press called Wild Honey Press.  Will be glad to send
copies for potential review.

I'd also like to write some reviews.  If you wish to see some examples of
my "work" (it's pleasure really), I can send some.

best wishes

and congrats on such a good idea

In the spirit of getting a positive thread going, what do people on the
list have to say about bp nichol.  I noticed that the phrasing of the
conference abstract suggests that he is still alive.  I take it this means
his influence lives on, but in the midst of the matyrology, one can be
forgiven for mixing up presence and absence.

As a start, can someone confirm for me whether nichol was a student of
Robin Blaser?  Or is his work developed along a parallel circuit with the
notion of serialism (is it surrealism) as poetic method?

This is in response to Robert's e-mail re bpNichol & influence. It's
certain his influence is alive and well. And to further a point made
implicit in your post: In an issue of th _Capilano Review_ (summer
1995?) Robin Blaser sd that Nichol was "top of the heap." i've always taken
Blaser's comment very seriously, and won't argue. There is also much
scholarship on Nichol currently in the works. It's very exciting.
Whenever i talk to people about Nichol they say things like "he was
connected" -- to what? with what? WHAT! . . . something sacred. i think
the poetic relationship between Blaser and Nichol--is intimate. And then the
one between Nichol and Duncan remains to be written. Altho from what i
have learned, i don't think Nichol was ever all that taken by Duncan's
work. Maybe he felt it was a bit inaccessible. Maybe Nichol's sense or
idea of the sacred is more immediate, everyday, and ordinary. But then so
might Duncan's. i dunno. Blaser--Duncan--bpNichol . . . very inneresting!

Nichol's "Talking About The Sacred in Writing" (in _Tracing The Paths_)
is very useful. . . . "Godness" in terms of "pataphysics . . .

Charles made a comment about Henry's commentary fitting into certain
aspects of the bookmaking realm. Which mused me with similarities for a
few days. A fine press uses hand set type, sewn signatures, spine
covers, textured paper stocks, to create a book into a made thing with a
sense of typography and place, not a generated commodity.

"When the purpose of printing is to produce cheap, disposable copies, as
is the case with paperbacks, high-speed rotary presses are functional
and acceptable. Such means, however, seldom provide the esthetic aspect
of reading-- the look and feel of a good page."
                    Warren Campbell, _A short history of the printed
word_

We are missing the book here. There are generative commodity writer's
out there on any side seen worthy to name. In the way that MFA programs
have given us plenty of "competent writers,"  the more "experimental"
based programs give us a different ilk with similar results. Except in
rare instances, the total book has disappeared through the falsity of
sentence fracture. Why should it matter if the sentence was written out
first then fractured or written for fracture, when the results are the
same tired notion sacked from "A roll of the dice will abolish chance?"
Late last century is hardly innovation. Where the looks of a piece are
the show not an aspect thereof like how revising history through the
guise of a new film prepares us in spirit for the next, not to denigrate
the last.

It reminds me of a study presented before the American Marketing
Association a few years back.  Truthful advertisements fail, but false
ones succeed in placing end use consumers in a buying mode.

The creation of the unique art-book is related to the exchange between
poetry & visual art in concrete poetry, & the suggestion of bpNichol as
an antidote to the negative/dialectic haggling over the dizjunk issue.
From his book titles alone (all I've seen of it for now)
Nichol seems to be somebody with a sense of humor & a strong art-sense,
a spiritual independence, pure joie-de-vivre.  Poetry needs to
draw sustenance from this kind of life & example.  On the other hand I think
poetry has strange spiritual weapons (Blake, Hopkins, Dickinson, Shakespeare,
Milton, come to mind) which are in the word itself and transcend the
mode of presentation to some extent; poetry has its resources, sui generis,
just as visual art does, which I have been trying to point out in the
emphasis on clear speech etc.  Perhaps the most radical aspect of pure
art is the sense of play which as Jordan pointed out ain't dialectical but
generous... calling down judgement on the utilitarian, mechanical, pre-
artistic or sub-artistic, the careerist, the arriviste, the noisy, the
ideological, the rational, the irrational, the graceless, purely on the
basis of its graceful presence amongst us... its fulfillment of its own
joyful prerogatives... that takes a certain gift & sweat...

Dear Small Boat,

I generally agree with this, except I don't see the problem as being that
books are mass-produced, and that really good 'total books' (a
questionable phrase, Blanchot might say) must be hand-made/letterpressed
etc. (as bourgeoise fetish-objects). Simply, typography does certain
things with certain materials, and this is too easily forgotten as typography
is ostensibly to remain transparent, to somehow assure the total delivery
of the text.

There are some poems that do great things on a photocopied page. I try to
remember with my work on Aporia that the type itself is performative.....

Like Senor Silliman, I also knew what the notice from Peter was going to be
on the list but I still reeled into a pretty shocky state. I spoke with a
friend later who said,"No. We knew Charles was dying" but I did not know
that at all. Many years ago, Charles had meningitus and spent months in
hospital. I still remember the sick anxiety of impending loss. But Charles
came through being that close to death and lived for a good long time before
the cancer showed up. He'd had operations and various treatments, was taking
a lot of really good supplements, was taking care of himself and was
continuing to work but being very mindful of his health, was not putting in
excessive hours at Special Collections, as he'd a tendancy to do. I know
he'd been putting in long days with Ted Byrne on the Blaser papers but I do
think he was pacing himself to not become overtaxed. I just always believed
he would prevail, as ever.
I so appreciate Peter Quartermain's sensitivity in the initial posting and
Bowering, Little and Silliman's tributes and reminiscences, particularly
mention of Charles's sense of humour which could be paradoxically droll yet
giggly. I always valued of Charles that he truly seemed to enjoy my own
socially inappropriate daftness as a worthy lark rather than pathologizing
me/'it' as many other real grown-ups were wont to do. & the giggle was right
out there when years ago I shared with him plans to form a LOUD BAND called
the Pound Scholars. Charles enjoyed his neighbourhood and his terrific
neighbours, including Lisa Robertson right upstairs. He had friends with him
towards the end and at the end and I am very glad that he was with those he
cared for and who cared for him so much. I last saw Charles at the reading I
did with Bowering a few weeks back and Charles was as he will always be for
me the Best Company.

I am having so much sadness with all of us in Vancouver. We have so much
loss and so much to remember. We'll probably be putting something together
along similar lines as the Kathy Acker Memorial Benefit through the Kootenay
School of Writing, possibly at the Western Front sometime in September but
its really early days on this.

I would say no - that it is not always oppositional, thoug it probably is
always, in some sense, dialectic: a questioning a old strategies, a
proposal of new ones.  But certainly a praxis focussed merely on
opposition, in failing to provide alternatives, misses the boat.  This is
why Jameson's Marxism is so dependent on descriptions of Marxian utopias:
as he "explains" to some degree toward the end of the POlitical
Unconscious, those invented utopias have a key purpose, they awaken both
dissatisfaction (w/ present conditions) and desire (for what has been
described).  & it's that latter conection between utopian description and
desire that I would say is *not* precisely oppositional in nature.
Jameson leanrs this from Burke who, in turn, learned it from Dewey.  Dewey
describes how the pragmatist might use ideal formulations, not to argue
there ontological validity, but for the complex set of negotiations which
they engender:

"the idea becomes a standpoint from which to examine existing
occurrences...the suggestion or fancy though still ideal is treated as a
possibility capable of realization *in* the concrete natural world.  As
such, it becomes a platform from which to scrutinize natural events."

This seems to me to be one motivation behind a lot of experimental
writing: it has a propositional quality, and treats new ways of
writing/speaking as potentially viable forms of communication.

There's quite a bit on bpNichol out there, & I have no doubt much more to
come. For those who knew him, he is still 'present,' & for those who only
come to him in the writing, I believe he will be a living force.

Stephen Scobie's early book, _bpNichol: What History Teaches_ still
available from talonbooks

ECWPress still has copies of _bpNichol and His Works_ (my monograph from 1992).

There was the special issue of West Coast Line _Tracing the Paths:
Reding/Writing the martyrology_ edited by Roy Miki, also from talonbooks; &
now, from _West Coast Line_ , _Beyond the Orchard: Essays on the
martyrology_, edited by Roy Miki & Fred Wah.

from _Open Letter_ (6th series, Nos 5-6 [Summer-Fall 1986[): _Read the Way
He Writes: a Festschrift for bpNichol_.

Those will give anyone a good start

        & with bp, it's always a good start...

Everyone on this list should treat him or herself to our own Kassia
(Kass) Fleisher's piece in the current electronic book review
(http:///www.altx.com/ebr/reviews/review7fleisher> called "oh Say Can

Ryan: the total book is a mallarmean notion. I thought this was obvious
from the mention of Un coup de des jamais. Perhaps not. Read Cook's
Mallarme on John's Hopkins. The comparative referent was how the medium
of bookmaking has changed, and the transience of that change over time
has caused a lowering of standards of what is published. From dime store
novels to current disposable poetry.

Be well

Henry hardly needs my help to defend himself. Let me just say that while I
disagree with him about the Sermon on the Mount (they were platitudes even
then, Henry), you seem to have misconstrued his attitude towards Yeats.

I've noticed in myself and others that artists tend to value, when we rank
other artrists, those whom we find useful to or related to our own work at
the moment of judgement. This is because, I think, we interact with their
work differently than either the lay audience or the teacher or critic. And
it's difficult to wear more than one of these hats at a time, which is why
I try to avoid teaching a great many poets whom others find essential.
I also (caveat to Henry) have found myself at times promoting with religous
ferocity poets I couldn't abide not long before. As my work evolves (or
devolves) towards or away from  the work of another my tastes modify.

Hey Joe! Nice to hear from you. Yeah, Charles WAS great. Just got a nice
message from Bill Luoma remembering him. Thamx too,Bill & aloha.

As for being "on" the list--it's an odd thing really, I'd not thought of
doing postings and such--I only just figured out how to do them (apologies
to any for any errors of form &c)--in this instance,however,because of our
friend Charles, there somehow seemed to me a need for a response in a public
testimony.

Umm--well--what do I "think". Well I'm mostly on this list for access to
information and the movement of information that is of some concern to the
Kootenay School of Writing (ie:there is a posting that a writer we'd be
interested in coming to x location & maybe we can get that person as well on
the same trip) & personally, to see what other people are nattering on
poetics. I found Karen Kelley contra Yau fictive gal consciousness pretty
interesting and all the Pvt Ryan stuff,particularly the earlier responses
and I believe Maxine Chernoff initiating the discussion. But by the time
they were all on about which way they wanted to die, I admit that I too was
thinking of which way I wanted them to die. There are quite a few of you out
there with a much more philosophical bent than I am rather impressed in my
pit of willful ignorance--go for it--looks good to ME anyway.

I enjoyed reading with you -- I did think it was a perversely interesting
mix -- I do know that you felt much better afterwards when it became
apparent that I am not only an Evil Language Dupe but also Spicer Spawn,
through a bastard yet noble lineage via the Spicer Diaspora.
We sort of can't help that up here. Any way, thamx again & keep in touch.

A festival of contemporary Russian poetry will be held on Sept 18 to 20
in St.Petersburg and Sept. 25 to 27 in Moscow. The title of the festival
is "Genius Loci". 24 poets from Russia (mostly Moscow and St.Petersburg)
will be participating, among them such prominent literary figures as
Dmitry Prigov, Lev Rubinstein, Arkadi Dragomoshchenko, Genrich Sapgir,
Viktor Krivulin. There will be a number of young poets too.

The festival is sponsored by the "New Literary Review' journal and
partly sponsored by the Soros Foundation.

All those who share an interest in modern poetry are very welcome to
visit.

Mark,

I agree w/ what you say about how one reads/ reacts to poets who have
affected one's own work (though I'm not sure that such a reaction is any
more or less valid than a supposedly "objective" critical or academic
one, since the "influenced" poet brings a unique perspective to
discussion of an author's work: & thus I think wearing multiple "hats"
may be appropriate).  However (& to get to yr main point), I don't think
that I _was_ commenting on Henry's attitude toward Yeats, but on his
apparently flippant dismissal of "Pound, Olson, Duncan, Creeley,
Palmer," as well as Ashbery.  Such a summary dismissal as I took him to
mean does nothing to further poetic dialogue, & does a disservice to
those poets, obviously, as well as to those of us who take their work
seriously.  I only brought up Yeats as a way to make this point clear to
Henry.  In doing so I wasn't attempting to characterize Henry's attitude
toward Yeats, or my own.

Thanks for your comments.

Marjorie recently mentioned my "Mouseover: Essay in JavaScript" piece that
appears in the current Electronic Book Review. I am posting this note to
let you know that, as the piece presently appears, it is not fully
readable. The editors are working on correcting this problem and I can let
the list know when the problem is corrected. Hopefully, it won't be long.
Thanks.

My reading about early Russian Futurism leads me to ask:
What is a proletarian poet?
Is this someone with a proletarian backgroun?
Is this someone who writes for (on behalf of politically) the

Is this someone who writes for the proletariat's enjoyment (for

Wanted to say, since we've had some contentious exchanges, that I
completely agree w/ what's said here, w/ the possible exception of
David's comment about fragmentation-- just that I don't subscribe to the
ideology of innovation, so the fact that we date fragmentation from
Mallarme or the sonnet from the troubadors is not in & of itself
relevant to whether it's alive NOW in a given practitioner's work.

Could it be that semantics (or Henry's spirit of devil's advocacy)
covers up broader areas of agreement?

Just checking...

Henry,

You call it "my territory". But is this anything so new? The 'new age' has arrived? Or didn't Blake recognize this  194 years ago? I haven't read much of Blake's -Milton- but  Is this territory you are proclaiming as "my  territory", also a territory which shares a boundary with the ignorant 'hirelings'  who don't recognize the 'proper rank' of the 'writings of Pound, Olson, Duncan, Creeley, Palmer, etc.'?

For example, are you espousing along with Blake that their writings seem like 'artifice' when compared to the 'sublime'  "Sermon on the Mount"?  So the so-called 'counter-traditionalists' along with the  AshberybloomVendler  School of Social Research are only making 'expensive advertizing boasts' and your territory is the only way to be 'just & true' to our own Imaginations ? Hey who's to say you are not on target Henry : yours being the 'Bow'  to Blake's' Lyre'.

I'm not wanting to come off here like a smart-ass : Are you being serious? I mean, this seems to be the way, both implicitly and explicitly, your statements are to be taken. At the same time, are you saying also that  yours is  'just & true' way, which is what Blake is calling our  Imaginations? Am I mis-reading your statements?

 The boastful side of me wants to proclaim: What are you getting at? What in the sam heck are you talking about? !! In some sense , what you are calling 'my territory' is an awfully silly boast. Don't you think?

Chris

Hi All,

I just had a rejection letter from a mainstream journal, and it was
interesting because most of the criticisms were actually nice summaries of
exactly what I'm after in poetry (e.g. "It sounds like something crucial,
or even heartfelt, is trying to be expressed, but it gets lost in a sea of
slippages" - I like that "Sea of Slippages" bit, it would make a good book
title). Anyway, that old hobby horse "clarity" gets dragged out for another
thrashing, and Ryan's comment about type being performative reminded me of
just how inappropriate such optical metaphors (clear or unclear, opaque or
transparent) are when it comes to describing language.

> There are some poems that do great things on a photocopied page. I try to
> remember with my work on Aporia that the type itself is performative.....

Words are always obscure: they work by obscuring part of the page, and it's
the pattern of obscuration that (per)forms the poem. If I wanted my words
to be clear, I'd have to write in invisible ink.


        Tom.


(another gem from the rejection letter was "just what is the reader
supposed to make of the last stanza?" Heck, don't ask me, I'm just the
author.)

Hey Joe! Nice to hear from you. Yeah, Charles WAS great. Just got a nice
message from Bill Luoma remembering him. Thamx too,Bill & aloha.

As for being "on" the list--it's an odd thing really, I'd not thought of
doing postings and such--I only just figured out how to do them (apologies
to any for any errors of form &c)--in this instance,however,because of our
friend Charles, there somehow seemed to me a need for a response in a public
testimony.

Umm--well--what do I "think". Well I'm mostly on this list for access to
information and the movement of information that is of some concern to the
Kootenay School of Writing (ie:there is a posting that a writer we'd be
interested in coming to x location & maybe we can get that person as well on
the same trip) & personally, to see what other people are nattering on
poetics. I found Karen Kelley contra Yau fictive gal consciousness pretty
interesting and all the Pvt Ryan stuff,particularly the earlier responses
and I believe Maxine Chernoff initiating the discussion. But by the time
they were all on about which way they wanted to die, I admit that I too was
thinking of which way I wanted them to die. There are quite a few of you out
there with a much more philosophical bent than I am rather impressed in my
pit of willful ignorance--go for it--looks good to ME anyway.

I enjoyed reading with you -- I did think it was a perversely interesting
mix -- I do know that you felt much better afterwards when it became
apparent that I am not only an Evil Language Dupe but also Spicer Spawn,
through a bastard yet noble lineage via the Spicer Diaspora.
We sort of can't help that up here. Any way, thamx again & keep in touch.

I do not believe a specific sense of Mallarme ala benchmark was invoked,
but rather a benchmark like I slept here, or at some future point, "when
Mark lived in Colorado the such and such movement and yadda, yadda," A
Timeline, I mean. Or locus solus. I'm curious Mark, what is "the
ideology of innovation" you mention, I am taking it that one person
would not be attributable solely for an innovation. My view is biased
though by wanting an attributation to a group rather than an individual.
Or do you mean a McGann type of indeterminacy (no such thing as authored
text but rather textual evidence toward that ideal)?  Or is it more how
"make it new" threads through the past, a culmative effect?

In semantics, if that which is meant or pointed to is unclear it may be
called the reference (librarian tie in).

Be well

Tom,

Your missive (reprinted below for those whose short term memory was left
behind in the 1960s) brings up the age-old (50 years at least) problem of
class background, class stance and class position. It's possible for
somebody to fall into any one of those categories -- Engels the factory
owner, for example -- and imagine himself as part of some version of a
classically defined proletariat. "We are the world," etc.

While it's always useful to look at specifics (as in "X was the child of the
professional-managerial class, but by becoming a poem became downwardly
mobile"), it's never been that useful overall to get into pissin' contests
over which conceptualization of the working class (or, as one Steve
McCaffery poem I believe has it, the "wukking class") is being bandied
about, and as we move into an ever later capitalism I notice the term being
used with less and less clarity and specificity every day.

              <lee.r.christian@USA.NET>

responding to Lee Christian & Mark DuCharme - I called it my territory in
response to Rachel Loden's sensible "territorializing" post.  I don't know
about Blake, but I do believe several strands of modernist poetry (Pound,
Williams, Olson, & their heirs), while claiming a "historical" angle of
vision, somehow leave out the whole impact of Judeo-Christianity on
Western culture (except in negative terms).  This is probably an endlessly
debatable & somewhat dead-end issue so let's just leave it there.
Secondly, & relatedly, I do happen to think that the poetic-narrative
dramatic impact of the Bible - the sermon on the mount, say, placed in its
dramatic context - that impact has been incredible.  so powerful that
individual artists sometimes need to shield their eyes from all the
cultural predispositions & impressions in order to create their own work.
This too is a huge issue for blab...  & I will continue creating my
"list-image" as reactionary religious fanatic egomaniac.  But when I say
that "one saying" from the Sermon on the Mount trumps all the poets I listed
for poetic power, it's not pure exaggeration.  Start reading the Bible
say - Genesis to the "New Testament" - see if you don't agree.  This is
not evangelizing on my part.  I'm talking about literary impact.

Mark - why does making controversial - perhaps scandalous! - statements on the
list mean I have a big ego?  Maybe I do - but mainly I just like to
mindfuck people with wild ideas, when I'm not into boring them to tears.

as a result, I don't at first glance know who on the list has posted the
msg; and if they person does not sign the msg, then i never know who
sent it; about 6 months ago, it was different; it would say in my inbox
under From: Charles Bernstein, or Rsilliman, or whatever.

i am told that this might be fixable at your end. can you?

saw him was abt 3 yrs ago in Sonoma -- steadfastly refusing to "read" any of
the scrawl poems he was projecting w/ an overhead -- & Joanne Kyger heckling
from the back, "C'mon Bob, read us a PO--EM" & Bob just grinning, inviting

                            Therefore let us act as if we were dead

Culturebox's note: Was Housman Pound's mentor? Culturebox doubts it,
though she doesn't actually know. It doesn't matter. Patrick has
correctly identified a masterpiece of spiterature: literature as a
projectile of spit, composed in the spirit of spite.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I got my books from Spain today that I sent myself a few weeks ago. Here
is a poem by Jorge Riechmann (this is not a hoax):

"Je ne suis pas Marxiste" (Karl Marx)

Until 1939 I was a Marxist.
Then I became
a Marxist.

I was a Marxist until 1956.
But the events of that year
shook up many of my certainties
and I became a Marxist.

So things went on.  Universal history
beat me up once more on purpose
and that same year
I was transformed into a Marxist.

In spite of everything I was a Marxist
until 1989.  For some ideologues
the end of history, for me the year
when I definitively
succeded in becoming a Marxist.

Content-Type: text/plain

Dave, by "ideology of innovation" I was crudely trying to express
something that I think Henry may be reacting against, a notion that I
think was expressed by Pound (I don't have the book at hand), & went
something like: there are poets who are inventors, & others who come
along & refine the raw work derived from those "inventions," & still
others who come along & are just derivative without refining or adding
anything new.  This is in ABC of Reading, & you'll have to excuse me if
I don't remember the exact quote &/or can't express the fullness of
Pound's thought just at this wee hour of the evening.

I like your sense of "a benchmark like a slept here."  In that sense,
maybe, we should all be sleeping around.

I also agree that I prefer to attribute anything to the group more than
the individual.  All I was trying to convey is that any notion of
innovation which implies this sort of Poundian "progress" isn't
something I subscribe to.

Best,

Mark DuCharme

Henry,

I didn't mean to seem to characterize your ego. I wasn't trying to
comment on _you_, but on your post-- the "my" of "my territory."

As for the Bible, I'll admit I lack an appreciation of most of it, but
not for lack of having read a good bit in my parochial schoolboy days.
Perhaps I should read it again, but I do find Williams more engaging.

For a brilliantly mean dismissal of a contemporary I've always liked
Nietzsche's dismissal of Carlyle as "The philosophical equivalent of
dyspepsia."  -m.

Mushing & chatting about poetry & religion in a shallow way is a desecration
of both. Or at least an over-simplification.  There are cultural dimensions
of experience irreducible to uninformed chit-chat.  So my off-the-cuff remarks
are like a swine casting himself before pearls.  But I have found the
essays & work of Welsh poet David Jones provide a perspective on some of
the issues that fascinated Pound & the whole American experimental tradition -
a very different perspective which feels less alien to me.  See his essays on
Welsh culture & modern technocracy, art in relation to war, art & sacrament.
His concepts of religion as sign-making, of man as sign-making animal, of
the relations between the useful & the "extra-utile", the technical & the
beautiful-in-itself, the marginalisation of all art (the extra-utile) in
modern times, art as form reflecting wholeness, and so on.  Jones could be
thought of as a sort of relic in a way - of Welsh culture as the remnant of
"native" life analogous to Native American culture in America - and a
person caught up in watching the techno-globalization-commercialisation of
all life as a direct threat to Welsh culture & language.  But he is also
an english-native-speaker brought up in London, a representative of
"European" traditional (Christian) culture, and a veteran of WW I whose
war experience shaped all his writings.  His essays provide some sharp
critical insight on some of the marginal-experimental questions which
occupy this list, because he reflects on poetry from a perspective on
art & mankind in general which stretches way back - but on a very
different trail than say Olson or Duncan. But different from Eliot's
or Yeats's pomposities as well. - Henry Gould

Isn't "mushing and chatting about poetry and religion in a shallow way" a
description of the last few decades of Robert Bly's career? (One assumes
not MUSHing in caps.)

The latest volume of the Dictionary of Literary Biography just clunked
through my mail slot, and it looks like the most experiment-friendly
volume ever. Okay, I wrote something for it, and okay,  "the most
experiment-friendly DLB" may sound like the rough equivalent of "the
world's tallest pygmie," but check out some of the poets covered...

Full contents consists of essays on:

Michael Anania by Robert Archambeau
Rae Armantrout by Ann Vickery

I mean, Yee-Hah!  I'm not leaving my office for a week with all this to
go through.

What say we all get together and carry the editor, Joseph Conte, through
the streets of Buffalo while singing his praises?

(The best part of all this is that most big libraries get the DLB, so
you should be able to get your hands on this).

Innovators. Pound missed the drunken boat there. The exclamation of
Inventio as having a placement above the other four parts of oratory
hits me like one saying Pindar's anti strophes are the most important
element of a triad, or spacial cogency into irrationality in Demuth's #5
was the primary poignancy  of preferring cheese over the  milk and
macaroni after cooking. I advocate a current mimeticism into mediocrity.
Name who we wish. Excogitaire. For those of us who think there might not
be.

Be well

Since I've had quite a few queries backchannel about how to get the new
and miraculous DLB volume, here's some information about getting the
book:

The publisher's address is:

Gale Research
835 Penobscot Building
Detroit, MI 48226
USA

The book is:

Conte, Joseph, editor.  Dictionary of Literary Biography vol. 193,
American Poets Since World War Two (sixth series).  Detroit: Gale
Research, 1998. ISBN is 0-7876-1848-9.

I don't have price info, and the book, still white-hot from the press,
isn't listed on Amazon.com yet.

Note that this is the SIXTH SERIES -- Amazon has earlier volumes, also
edited by Conte, but they are different books.

Here's the bad news: this is a 12 by 8 inch, 450 page hardcover sold
mostly to libraries, so it costs a bundle.  I don't have a figure, but
the earlier series ran around $100 or $150.

That's a lot of cash, but if you can swing it the book is worth it.  An
event, a landmark, a big hoo-hah -- words fail me.  But if the money is
a problem, almost all university libraries will get copies, and the big
public libraries tend to take the DLB books, too.

Thanks to all for their interest,

Pardon the non-poetical post please, if such there be, o yes there be,
but I've just finished a freeware game perhaps for poets who like
puzzles called CoLoRaTiOn at http://www.islandnet.com/~jandrews/MORPHTEA
which, though not particularly poetical in any recognizable sense, is, I
think, original in concept and design. It can be played by young
children, but some of the mathematical issues it raises are unresolved
and can be pondered indefinitely.

It's really becoming a pet peeve of mine, this equation of Pound &
innovation for the purpose of dismissing both: could there be a more
flammable straw man?  Of course not, hence his invocation tends to be
followed by grousing and innuendo rather than a real, pragmatic discussion
of the relative merits of innvative models of artistic production.  You
can't begin, first of all, by assuming that "the parts of oratory" is
a scheme we need to accept out of hand: Pound's familiarity with such
schemes and his paradoxical reverence for them is precisely what makes
him such an easy target: he's the son who should know better.  But while
"inventio" is schematized easily enough, a discussion of innovation or
"experiment" might well move outside those preset boundaries: that is,
experiment can be taken as a more pervasive and far-reaching method, as it
is, for instance, in Ralph Ellison's discussions of "democratic vernacular
speech."  It's ironic that David B. would lean on "the parts of oratory"
without really discussing rhetoric as itself persuasive: the act of
separating oratory into parts is itself a rhetorical act, it implies a
certain attitude toward both language and experience, one which values
either the comfort provided or the power gained by preset categories.  In
contrast, there are arguments like John Dewey's that

"A Philosophy animated, be it consciously or unconsciously, by the
strivings of men to achieve democracy will construe liberty as meaning a
universe in which there is real uncertainty and contingency, a world which
is not all in, and never will be, a world which in some way is incomplete
and in the making, and in these respects may be made this way or that
according as men jusdge, prize, love and labor...a genuine field of
novelty of real and unpredictable increments of existence, a field for
experimentation and invention" (Characters & Events 2:851).

Now, Dewey spends 350 pgs in *Art as Experience* describing how this
insistence on "experimentation and invention" applies to language.  Let's
have a discussion about the merits of *that*, or of Burke's *Language as
Symbolic Action* (also a masterful argument for innovative writing) or,

Hallo !

while peeling potatos i was listening to the radio. It was an
interview with Christian Hinze from the Vienna Poetry School
announcing a course called "How to write a lovesong" from 15th till
28th of september. The course will lead Nick Cave.
12 people are allowed to take part. Cave himself will select these
peole out of applications they have to send. There are strict rules
for application.
Christian Hinze said the only song by Nick Cave he knew was the one
everybody kows and Blixa Bargeld (who has lead a course before)
invited him to a Bad Seed concert last year in Vienna. And after the
concert Hinze asked Cave whether he would like to lead a course at
the school, yeah and it seemed like he has agreed.....

who had ever thought he would...

  Yes, Robert, and we must not forget the picture of David at the piano

  Haven't gotten around to reading much of it yet, but have read
  Steve Evans' piece, and I think it does a great service to Perelman
  by NOT simply mentioning P's "canonical" poems, but also his
  earlier work....
  and also for including such phrases as--

this probably wouldn't help your vita, but it sounds quite fun.  it seems
that anything with the word "pirates" in the title is hip academically.
perhaps poe and piracy is a doable topic.

I doubt if anybody's against experiment & innovation per se.  But since
you seem to think a serious pragmatic discussion requires citation - then
how would one or more of the above authorities, do you think, respond to
the following positions of anglo-welsh artist-poet David Jones, which
he asserts in various places:

1. All art is fundamentally abstract, since it basically involves "making
a shape"; and the (Aquinas-Joycean) "radiance of form" is the substance
of the work itself.  So "abstract art" is an assertion of this basic aspect
in isolation to some degree.  Jones does NOT condemn it or even criticize it
on these grounds; but he suggests that any foregrounding of any particular
"virtue", while it may have immediate benefits, can lead to various kinds of
dessication.

2. All art is a sign-making activity which points toward something lost or
distant or "other"; in this sense it is "extra-utile", un-useful, impractical;
it is the opposite of what Jones (writing during WW II) called materialism,
pure force, the material "thing" without this "significance".  Not that he
was a "spiritualist" or anti-materialist; he was an "incarnational" artist,
whose exemplar was Joyce, and he related giving somebody flowers as a token of
love and the Eucharistic Mass as equally "significant".  Poetry & art
are essentially anamnesis - re-calling - something absent, via signs.

3. Well-made art aspires to re-member & contain EVERYTHING; thus comedy will
touch on tragedy & vice versa; a painting of a chair will recall thrones
& kingdoms, etc.  Art aspires to all-inclusive wholeness: this is "objective"
form.

For Jones the material of art had a "sacramental" unity; he was a old culture
bard,"conservative", who wrote long poems clearly influenced by Pound's
techniques as well as Joyce, the Bible, Blake, Smart, folk tales, history,
geology, etc.  This devotional mentality set him against a purely "material"
approach to art; the bardic role of memory (anamnesis) put limits on
invention for its own sake, which I think he would relate to pure materialism
or in-significance. At the same time he followed Jacques Maritain in
recognizing that art perfects itself within its own sphere (practice,
"doing") and this involves technical, formal "rightness".  But he
distinguished between the technical (or purely instrumental) and the
artistic (the making of "extra-utile" signs).  It's the old yin/yang,
active/contemplative, dominate/cooperate, nominalist/realist thang...

I don't think anybody's been "dismissing" experiment.  I for one have
been questioning some of the American shibboleths of who or what or in
what spirit experiment is now happening (or have been trying to anyway).

1. The difference that makes meaning may or may not be oppositional,
dialectic.

There is no context for this remark.

The difference that makes meaning what? Assume that some part of language is
being talked about, maybe some small part.

Is a phonemic difference meant, and if so, is a sort of "color-wheel" of
english (for example) phonemes implied? If so, how does this connect to
encryption and graphological systems of value (e.g. gematria, kaballah)? Do
systems which attribute different qualities to the letters pay their pathos
dues?

If not a phonemic difference, then what. Morphemes? The question, and then
the apap. The apparently relevant found text skews the rhetorical question,
it starts to look like allegory. The clause then because. Then becomes the
unit of meaning which must differ. The late 19th early 20th century terrain
of statements, hesitations and modifications.

But! subtle observations distributed among several clauses become
attenuated, less robust. Associationism and stream-of-consciousness present
a cluster of meanings, literature is writing again! Progress! (Or,
epistomology as SWAT team).

The party isn't over, you just stopped getting invited, at least until
things get retro enough for you to be seen as a genial precursor of the next
odd use for words.

Is this change in the making of meaning from the clausal genteel to free
clusterfuck ... is it a DIALECTIC change? Always already? Never not yet?

Is there sort of a techno-poetics specific to American poetry of which
Pound is the founder, an emphasis on the invention of new literary
techniques? While there are avant-gardes everywhere I don't find this same
obsession with techne per se in other modern traditions, to the same
extent at least.  Someone can correct me if I'm wrong on this. This is
what Bly was trying to say back in the 50s and 60s.  (not that I agree
with HIM)

Jones, as described by H.  Gould, seems vaguely Heideggerian (if that is
not a redundancy). The Heideggerian approach would seem to distrust
technique for at least two reasons--because technique seems somehow
inessential to what poetry is really about, and because technique is
related to technology, seeing the world as somehow raw material waiting
for us to instrumentalize it. Am I on the right track here or am I missing
the point?

I'll chirp in here.

For both Pound and Jones, I believe 'techne' is a form of weaving over
the surface of something soul-like and essentailly spiritual, a catching
of those shadows:
        And the small stars now fall from the olive branch,
        Forked shadow falls dark on the terrace
        More black than the floating martin (EP, Canto XLVII)

For Williams, 'techne' is more mahinic, the poem being a machine made of
words: 'techne' becomes 'method'. And this seems a pretty clear line
through Creeley and Olson to Bernstein. I think the notion of poetry or
language as an instrumental extension of the senses useful for making
discoveries otherwise not-detectable seems to me a very American, very
pragmatic take on how or why one writes.

So as far as this history goes, Pound is on Henry's side; Williams etc
aligns with Dewey etc.

william's "machine"
was a modernist technic of
responding to a query regarding "WHAT
is poetry." He meant it
and didn't mean it--for williams--
(see KORA) the machine always needed to
be refuled and reworked and discarded--plus
he very much thot of the AMERICAN machine--
a device.

A clear line to Charles B?
Nothing is a clear line--not always is writing a "instrumental extension
of the senses"--that's sd
obviously--ironically I hope--as the sense are
not always a part of writing. Haven't we got past that yet?

Did Duchamp inform Williams?

Yes-- Duchamp's "senses" include a love of the machine--
not of a singular (coleridge) self composed.

Yes " a device" this is very much what I meant in my hurry to conflate
reductions. The method of using language as a device for discovery (many
orders of discovery) seems very American. I believe Bernstein has spoken
more than once on meaning and method in ways that reflect this notion of a
"device." It is one of the clearer lines  among those that one might attempt
to trace. Watten too has an essay on on Williams's machine that seems to
align Williams with his own practice.

Now there are other methods--surrealism of course that I don't think will be
confused with 'techne".

I stand by my aligning of Pound and Jones with respect to techne and in
differentiation from the more mechinic and technical use of language as
device that seems distinctive of American Experimental poetry--pointing out
what I think of as a major mis-alignment of Henry's pawns.

*** Sony shutters camera that sees through clothes

Electronics giant Sony Corp. said Wednesday it had halted shipments
of some video cameras after finding they could be used for filming
more of their subjects than meets the eye. Some versions of the
Handycam have infrared technology which lets users shoot at night or
in darkness in a "night shot" mode. But magazine reports revealed
that when the special feature is used in daylight or a lighted room
with a special filter it can "see through" clothing - underwear can
show up, especially on those lightly dressed, and people wearing
swimsuits look almost naked. A Sony spokesman said the first the
company knew of the camera's surprise feature was when reporters
started asking for comments on the "new way" of using the camera. See

*** Killer mink, sharp fish dominate U.K. newspapers

If you are lucky enough to avoid the killer mink marauding through
Britain's forests and the razor fish littered across its beaches,
watch out for the funky chickens. This is the peak of the so-called
"Silly Season," when editors desperate to fill space resort to
stories which would usually be buried deep inside the paper. "In
France and Italy the whole country shuts down in August - even
cinemas close - but in Britain, hacks must still turn out a newspaper
and hope that something or other happens while the population takes
its two-week holiday," wrote Linda Grant of the Guardian broad-sheet.
In the dog days of August, anything will do. Most front pages on
Monday were dominated by the tragic story of unwary bathers on a
beach in southwestern England who cut their feet open on the exposed
shells of razor fish. (Reuters)

*** Iran women to be allowed to watch male wrestling meet

Iranian women will be permitted to attend a men's wrestling
competition for the first time in nearly 20 years, the vice-president
of Iran's wrestling federation said Wednesday. A special viewing
section will be allocated to women during the World Wrestling
Championships in Tehran on Sept. 8-11, the daily newspaper Tous
quoted Mohammad-Reza Taleqani as saying. After the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, women have been prohibited from attending men's sports
competition. See

You're not off the point but it gets complicated.  From the little I've read of
Jones so far it does seem he could fall into a sort of reactionary dualistic
thinking along the lines of CP Snow, emphasizing the wide gap between science
and art, technology and culture.  But it's complicated; his father & grandfathe
r I think were both craft workers in the London dockyards; his poetry his
FILLED with images of techne, making, etc.; he had an anthropological concept
of "man" the maker, claiming that "the Christian religion could not exist
without artefacture" (the bread & wine were not simply things of nature but
were "made" things).

Jones's fear of the sameness of industrializing technology is related to
his "Welsh" consciousness, the identification with a threatened local
culture, and perhaps this fear blinded him to the creative-theoretical
(non instrumental) aspects of science.  But he made up for it with a
highly organized christological aesthetics: the universe is itself a
"work of art", a "making"; the sacraments unite humanity with the
divine form at the crux of that making; art which remains true to itself
(the orbit of free & beautiful "making") is a sign of that larger whole;
and so on.  Jones's own poetry is highly technical & experimental -
but he distinguished between all the functional arts (from agriculture to
war) & the fine arts, which are strictly "useless", being devoted to
beauty-as-it-is.  (Not without acknowledging the beauty of the functional
as a basis & inspiration of the fine arts.)  If you read some of his essays &
poetry you notice his awareness of a great deal of "useless beauty" not
only in art itself but in life in general, everywhere.  The link between
the two is what he saw threatened by mere functionalism, utilitarianism,
standardisation, etc.

I don't want to juxtapose Pound & Jones; you can find these
affinities & contrasts just about anywhere.  Perhaps Jones didn't
emphasize the "instrumentalities" of technique as much as Pound did
because he was actually more derivative, & borrowed a lot from Pound
himself.  But you won't find Jones talking about the culture-changing
possibilities of the variable foot or the breath-line or the materiality
of the signifier or breaking the pentameter etc. etc. He had a different,
perhaps deeper sense of craft, possibly because he was a skilled painter
as well as a poet.  All the techne goes for naught if the "form" of the
artwork gives no "sign" - and he understands this in a kind of strict,
Jesuitical, almost military sense, derived partly from Joyce & Aquinas.
& the "signs" are coterminous & continuous with the miraculous & incarnational
formal "sign-substance" of reality itself... - Henry Gould

Abstract art makes a splash by devaluing every referent except itself,
but that's a risky strategy because the next step is to devalue itself;
so you have Ab Expressionism & then the referent zeroes in on flags
& targets for a moment & then pop, value of art per se is gone. Example
of Jones's idea of a virtue taken in isolation.  So postmodernism took
association streams of meaning & just left the clusters, took out the
meanings; you have abstract-abstractionism in literature; self-reference
to nada; clusters of clusters.  Naturally the clausal-causal sentence
starts to seem dialectical in this atmosphere.  "The purpose of art is to

ah--ok. but really--I was attacking yr instance of "self or sense"
as primary device--that might have been true at one point of
williams--but
the poem extends much further than the "senses" and--again--my instance
of Duchamp--and Williams--as Williams was most influenced and interested
in that school of thot--the armory show/etc.

we need to rid the "self" from such discussion of poetics--

"I" amend.

* In May, Walter Scott Knieriemen, who admitted breaking into a
woman's home in Wheeling, W. Va., was acquitted of burglary
charges after a jury apparently found that he had done it without
illegal intent.  A psychiatrist testified that Knieriemen suffered
from a childhood-based sexual dysfunction that impelled him to
pursue a pair of leather gloves he had recently seen the woman
wear.

* The Guardian (London) newspaper reported in May on the
enormous television audiences in Brazil watching the nightly, Jerry
Springer-like show "Ratinho Livre" (roughly, The Mouse,
Unleashed), a forum for the downtrodden.  Among recent
interviewees were patients with horrible medical conditions
begging for otherwise-unaffordable treatment (e.g., 8-year-old boy
with 21 tumors in his mouth); a woman whose eyes were skewered
and ears lopped off in a domestic fight but whose husband was still
on the lam; and an equally unpopular husband and wife, whom the
audience urged to assault one another.

* Cafe Ke'ilu ("Cafe Make Believe") opened in a trendy section of
Tel Aviv, Israel, in April, with tables, chairs, plates, silverware,
menus, and servers, but no food or drink.  Explained manager Nir
Caspi (who calls the experience "conceptual dining"), people come
to be seen and to meet people but not for the actual food.  The
menu, designed by top-rated chef (and owner) Phillipe Kaufman,
lets diners order some of the world's most exquisite dishes (eel
mousse, salad of pomegranates, if in season), "served" on elegant
(but empty) platters.

* In November, the Albuquerque Environmental Health
Department, in an official inspection report, urged that the Ice
House nude-dance club should immediately correct two food-
contamination conditions.  First, it was serving pizza at less than
the required 140 degrees F.  Second, wrote the city inspector, a
sanitation risk was being posed by a dancer named Stephanie
Evans, whose act consisted in part of expelling Ping Pong balls
from her vagina to various points in the room, in that the balls
could possibly land on pizza slices or in customers' drinks.


* The official historical agency Heritage Canada released its 1998
calendar in January marking such benchmark dates as "World
Book and Copyright Day" but making no mention of Christmas
and Easter.  And an official Valentine's Day poster at Langara
College in Vancouver, British Columbia, featuring a silhouetted
female and a male ready to kiss, drew fire from a campus gay and
lesbian group, which suggested a "neutral" image of two hands
clasping.  That latter image itself was later derided by a Langara
student union representative as possibly offensive to a person with
no hands.


* In March, the Romanian soccer team Jiul Petrosani sold
midfielder Ion Radu to the Valcea team for about $2,500 worth of
pork.  (Jiul Petrosani earlier traded defenseman Liviu Baicea to
Valcea for 10 soccer balls.)

* In a story on pet-friendly hotels, the Boston Globe in April
reported that the Four Seasons lets pets stay free and offers a
special menu (including room service) featuring "Rin Tin Tin
Tartare" (tenderloin and egg yolk) and "Cat's Meow" (poached
salmon with arborio rice), as well as special desserts and dishes for
pets on a diet.

* In February, Christian Poincheval, a radio station manager in
LeMans, France, introduced Petit Lutin toilet paper for the "reading
room," on which are printed short articles on French current affairs,
geography, and culture, with no-stain ink and new editions to be
released monthly.


* Recent Restaurant-Openings:  In Tokyo, the trendy Alcatraz BC,
themed after the California prison, in which diners are handcuffed,
eat in cells, and must beg permission from the guards to be allowed
out to visit the restroom.  And in London, a pill-themed restaurant
called The Pharmacy (designed by edgy artist Damien Hirst), with
prescription containers everywhere, barstool seats resembling
aspirins, and staff dressed as surgeons.  ("The challenge," said co-
owner Jonathan Kennedy, "was how far you can go before it
becomes too much.")  And in Singapore, the House of Mao, an
otherwise-upscale Chinese restaurant but with green-uniformed
staff and pictures galore of Mao Zedong.

* In February, two Russian cosmonauts aboard the Mir space
station hawked NASA space pens ($32) and other paraphernalia on
the American QVC shopping channel, in an effort to raise some
money for their country's underfunded space program.  A total of
530 people bought something, including 11 who paid from $90 to
$2,500 for tiny Mars rocks.  Six others submitted to credit inquiries
about buying $25,000 Sokol KV-2 spacesuits.

I think Don's answer to Henry below is a smart and succinct frame.   The
mention of Heidegger, too, is potentially useful - Jones, as described by
Henry believes that "all art is a sign-making activity which points toward
something lost," - this, I think bears relation to that tendency of
Heidegger's (which, incidentally, rubs off on Derrida) to deify the
endless chain of signification.  As Heidegger put it,

"The origin of language is strange and mysterious.  And this means that
language could only have arisen from the overpowering, the strange and
terrible, through man's departure into being.  In this departure, language
was being, embodied in the word: poetry."

What's interesting to me here is that someone like Dewey wouldn't take
exception to Heidegger's premise so much as his emphases, as revealed in
those adjectives: "strange and mysterious...the overpowering, the strange
and terrible."  Language becomes in Heidegger's hands, the substituted
God-term, it is what has been lost, and - most important - what can only
be found in a moment of transcendent revelation or the like.  If Jones is
like Heidegger and Heidegger is like Pound it's here: "the book should be
a ball of light in one's hand," as EP put it.  So while Dewey would
certainly agree that language is mysterious, that, as Heidegger would say
(after Heracleitus), it "likes to hide," he would be careful about using
words like "overpowering" and "terrible" b/c he's keen to their rhetorical
dubiousness.  He'd prefer to emphasize the utility of linguistic
contingency when it is *not* mystefied, when art is not a hand stretched
toward a lost other (language, God, it makes no difference since
rhetorically it serves the same purpose: we were once part of it and now
we're alienated); when art is, instead a particularly useful method for
negotiating both with and against received vocabularies, useful, as Don
sugested, for discovering "what's new" about the body's relation to the
body-politic.  -m.

Todd --

Why get rid of the "self", even only from these discussions? It sounds so
retro, so Lukacs, I mean, _maybe_ .....  maybe get rid of selfish poetics?
or elfin poetics, shellfish ...

but you gotta remember, what Charlie B. said was that it was a mistake to
posit the self as the basis for a poetics, he didn't _exclude_ it, not that
_Content's Dream_ is _scripture_ ......   or papal bull ..... no matter what
the inarticulate and unreasonable forces of journalism might say, to argue
for the interchangeability of selves is .. on the one hand, beautiful, on
the other, deadly        so

so anyway, as I say, Todd, I'm saying it to you, Todd,

Todd didn't suggest getting rid of the "self" from such discussions. Here's
what he said, precisely:

"we need to rid the 'self' from such discussion of poetics--"

which as I read it, suggests that we need to get rid of such discussion of
poetics, or at least banish such discussion from the "self."  which I took
as a more interesting suggestion.

Thanks to Bob Archambeau (whose fine article on former Buffalo doctoral
candidate Michael Anania appears in DLB 193) for posting the table of
contents for this volume, copies of which have just arrived at the homes
and offices of its various contributors, several of whom are
listmembers.

One correction to Bob's list of essays, while Steve Evans did write an
excellent piece on Bob Perelman for the volume, the essay on Stanley
Plumly was written by Plumly's colleague at Columbia, SC, Ron Baughman.

I'll take some credit for reversing the trend in earlier volumes on
American poetry toward the New Formalism and other creations of the
creative writing programs around the country.  But I'd like to note that
contact with many of the contributors through this list was instrumental
in arranging, gathering, and recruiting (the hardest part of editing
these volumes) the range of articles on progressive, experimental
writing.

It's true that the earlier volumes, v. 165 & v. 169, are available
through Amazon.com at about $150.  Contributors can get a 40% discount
on sales of the volume.  It's obviously targeted by Gale Research Press
for sale as a reference volume to research, university, school, and
public libraries.  So it's widely available, or will be in a short
while.  And the 81/2 x 11 in. pages are easily photocopied.

Thanks again to all the contributors--and subjects of entries--who are
on Poetics.

seeing as the "self" has been a dangerous tool for so much
(terrorism--today--government selves--a poetcis that is still hampered
by "a spontaneous overflow of emotion) and that I feel akin to the
visual arts as much if not more often than so much poetry--and those
visual or plastic arts of--as I sd Duchamp--and such--the focus needs to
be on LANGUAGE not the self that thinks it is representing a sense or
emotion or even thot.  I think Charle's work is so much more
interesting--and that of course "I" am not saying that we have no
selves--only that our art needs to extend itself the way that film,
sculpture, painting, assembladge, etc has done . Poetry still comes with
a knot tied in it--for readers--that this is a reading of the poet's
"self".  Burroughs said that painting had (1950) far surpassed
writing--and I'm always still very much with that thot in mind.

it's not deadly to try and remove the self from a discussion of poetry.
As I've said--(it was me) if I want to know something of the poet's
elf--we can do that over coffee--if I want a poem--I'll read!

Unfortunately for Henry's argument the "creative-theoretical
(non-instrumental) aspects of science" (whatever this phrase might mean)
are MORE dependent on notions of "sameness" e.g mathematical
formalization, quantification, reduction etc.) than their assembly line
fruits. A limited number of mathematically expressable characteristics
or properties circumcribes the being of the object. This approaches
Heidegger's view, in small part, on science and technology. Sameness at
the level of experiment and communication is mandatory and anomolies are
ignored, suppressed and/or elided unless they overwhelm through their
own process of formalization the existing (dare I use the word)
paradigm. This notion of formal constituents did escape Jones and is
related to his ideas concerning social hierarchies. ---Carlo Parcelli

I always understood that as saying that by the time your poem is being
read, someone else is inhabiting the space of your written "I". That the
poet's written "I" is a construct that must make room for another.

And I also thought it meant that who-one-is. is as strange as anything else
writing touches upon. And also, "to you, I am a you." And then . . .

"Because I would not stop for Death" .. .is a composite of ED(whatever one
discovers or conjectures concerning her), oneself (or "one's elf" as
amusingly put by parties to this discussion), the condition of being an I
(which is not comnpletely an historical determination, that is, we are
species AND we are new), as another New Englander has it, "As soon as/I
speak, I/speaks."

A rider : the other day, a friend defined _I love you_ as "I would die for
you." Otherwise, it shouldn't be said, he said. !!  I'm intrigued how this
attaches to "I is an other."

Perhaps Rimbaud was feeling the Otherness of language, too. That one is
othered by language, even as one is created of it. One goes to speak
but--the words are already in the way. "I can feel my eye/breaking."  But
then there's Whitman's sense of I, "I am there with you in your kayak"--of
which Lawrence makes such hay in _Studies in Classical American Literature_
.

However all this may/not be (for you or for me), the poetic act is the
apparently ungrammatical "est" in lieu of "suis," the separation that
prevents the knee-jerk assumption of what must always follow "je". It's a
fissure thru which l/sp/eak volumes. It's the necessary act of
transgression that stops habit and opens thought, it's the poetic.   David

My word-processing spell check translates "je" as "Joe." I propose we adopt

I spent four years in Amherst and never once went to the "Homestead." The
Homestead is the homey name tagged onto a brass plaque sign in front of The
Emily Dickinson House. It's on Main Street. I lived a stone's throw (the
best form of anecdotal measurement) west on North Pleasant Street. On the
opposite side of the Homestead is Bart's Pizza. It's ok but not spectacular
and my friends and I patronized it mainly because it was on Main Street and
the delivery time was relatively quick. Up the street, indeed uphill, from
the Homestead, is the new police station, Amherst College, and the center of
town (Amherst).

I don't believe any of what I am saying is mentioned in the Susan Howe book.
This is obviously a political issue, and I will be heard.

There is a tourist shop in the garage of the Emily Dickinson House. There
are books for sale, postcards, booklets, chapbooks, book mementos,
photographs, and key-chains with heavy books on them. I bought three
postcards and didn't send them to anyone.

Down the street from the Emily Dickinson House is a house of no distinction
save the fact that my friend Jack lived there one semester. One night Jack
and his friends had a great party where everyone got really drunk and
stoned. We danced and sang, just like in the Amherst of Emily Dickinson's
time. Then Jack got completely naked and began running around the house. It
was springtime I think.

When the cops showed up they entered without knocking and shot the stereo.
No, wait, come to think of it they did not shoot the stereo but they did ask
one of us to turn it down. I then began an endless, meaningless, and stupid
cascade of verbal abuse directed at the law officers which was filled with
forgettable things but said quite loudly. On a certain cue, like a trained
pet, I clammed up. The cue was: "if you don't shut the fuck up, we're going
to arrest you." This proved to me that the State is superior in
psychological warfare. I was too weak to resist. It was at that point that
Jack ran into the house, naked as a bluejay.

On the walk to the new police station (to retrieve Jack) we passed the Emily
Dickinson House. It was closed.

The tour of the Homestead begins in the garden. The guide, a middle-aged
woman with an English accent and librarian glasses, spoke with touching
fondness about what Emily grew, where Emily walked, what Emily's niece had
to say about it, and where the barn stood. Apparently, no structure had ever
stood in this portion of Homestead land. In the distance, a man was exiting
the parlor known as Bart's.

If you think the single surviving photograph of Emily Dickinson is pretty
dry and unrevealing, then her house is a crusty supplement indeed to the
photograph. The house has been restored well enough (an Evangelical pastor
with a family of 8 once lived there and they installed four bathrooms) and
we even got to see the narrow steps where Emily sat while her "guests"
played the piano for her but didn't get to meet her. There was a bit of
freakishness about the house, about Emily herself, that was charming. We saw
China. The china was a wedding gift to Emily's parents.

Here is something of note: there is a Seth Thomas clock in Emily's bedroom.
You may recall that Charles Olson's dad wound a Seth Thomas clock in his
drawers in the living room every day except the 30th of each month.

Emily's original bed has kept quite well over the years. It's a sleigh bed.

The tour guide tells us that Emily asked that all her letters be burned upon
her death. And her poems too I say. No, the guide says, just the letters.
Well, I'm not going to argue with you I say, but you're completely wrong, a
sham and travesty to the National Park system. She clenches her fists. Her
eyes flare in anger. I make a fart sound with my lips but she has already
succeeded in undermining my confidence. Susan Howe, where are you?

After a spell, some wandering, reading of placards but no taking of
pictures, we leave the house. It's a quite nice Federal style house. Next
door, the home of Emily's brother is being restored. It looks like the
mansion from The Addams Family. It was occupied by the Dickinson family
until 1987, the year I came to Amherst.

As my companion and I walk toward town and past the now-not-quite-as-new
police station, we are diverted by some new public art. Two silhouettes atop
two large rocks and facing each other and making hand gestures, as if
speaking to each other. One silhouette is Emily Dickinson. Beside her is a
plaque explaining that Emily was a poet, lived a stone's throw from the big
stone her shadow now sits upon, and a poem is reprinted too. The opposite
figure? If you guessed Robert Frost, there is a future in public art
awaiting you. He too is gesturing beside the plaque which explains him, his
life, his time in Amherst, his kooky relationship to words, etc.

My companion snaps pictures. She's from California. And I, I turn to the
police station, toward the west, where the course of empire went.

At first I thought to b-c this to Al Filreis, but decided it may be of
interest more generally. There was an article some years since, in _West
Coast Line_, which comes from Simon Fraser U in Vancouver (Burnaby, to be
exact), making use of archived materials having to do with _Northwest
Review_ and _Coyote's Journal_ and which I recall referred to Stern's
showing of his film "Y"(? "Stop Sign"?) at U of O in Eugene in 62 or 63.
This was a showing I attended, and thus may be mixing up the article I
allude to, with my own experience: apologies if so.

 Gerd Stern was a wild-man, mad-artist "beat" from SFran, & his art  was
far out to some of us then, heavily edited to keep the eye quick, and as
part of its "epater le bourgeois" address. I think portions of human
anatomy not usually seen in movies (back then) were in the film and caused
some scandal. This may have prepared Oregonian conservative hearts and
minds to turn into a ton of bricks a year or so later when an issue of NWR
was declared blasphemous, obscene and treasonable, by powers-that-were, &
got the editorial staff (of which I'd been a member), canned.

This period is increasingly interesting to me--where the 50s and the 60s
meet in teeter-totter fashion--and I hope this note, though fragmentary,
will bring further testimony. As to the Seven Stray Cats, of them I recall
nothing. Anyone got a dish of cream re them?  David

        A dude more autre there couldn't be.
        He thinks so un- & -like the rest,

        He may do opposite. O, he's perverse
        But what strikes all as even worse,

        He says that Portugal's in Spain,
        That Spain's in pain, that pain's delight,
        That black is white, that day is night,
        That night is a lacustrine city,

Howdy folks, just thought I'd mention that the long interview (2 hrs, & in

I did w/ Harryette Mullen is now up on the Mullen page at the EPC website.
Mullen ranges all over the place and is always fascinating.   For those of

No joe, that would be "Bob."

As Agent Cooper once asked, "Where does Bob come from?"

Answers:        (1) That cannot be revealed.
                (2) Maybe Bob is just the name we give to the evil we do.

I ran through my spell checker an article I just wrote, it suggested I
change Mayhew to mayhem (I should have seen that one coming), Heidegger to
headgear, Sartre to Sartorial.

When we got back from Spain, my 3 year old daughter asked me "where did
the hotel go?" I told her it was in Spain. The next day I asked her where
the hotel was and she said "in the pain," thus anticipating David B' line
"Spain is in the pain."

        Joe's assertion isn't negated by this information -- all it means is
that evil isn't universal . . . (which will come as a great relief to the
more theologically minded among us).

It's been very important to me. The only long sequence (and I mean long
both in terms of # of lines and the time over which it was/is being
written) that I have attempted has the idea of location at its core. I
wonder whether this is a tendency that others have noticed: my sequence
(Urban Songs) evolved as a response or reaction to sequences by Olson,
James K. Baxter, Leigh Davis and Dinah Hawken, all of which have a strong
sense of engaging with location.

I started Urban Songs not so much to write _about_ my location, but with
the hope that all of its concerns (ambition, desire, poetics, technology,
friendship) would inevitably be _of_ my location. And the location of the
sequence is somewhat fluid: I moved from Wellington to Auckland and back
while writing it, so the location represents a superimposition of these two
cities upon "the idea of the city".

In New Zealand, the idea of location has been central to the arts for much
of this century, with "location" being equated with "landscape". But the
last few decades have seen this equation breaking down, and I've been
interested in the way that "location" (and "home") is now seen as being
inscribed by culture; by economic, electronic, emotional and intellectual
networks. I've lived in about six flats since I started the sequence, but
there is a sense in which the poem's location remains constant. Of course,
factors such as geography, climate and history leave unavoidable traces on
the poems, but not to the extent that they do in the Maximus poems.

Perhaps the centrality of location in one's work is related to one's sense
of that location's otherness. Mid-century pakeha poets were obsessed with
their location because it was so distant from Europe, that being the centre
of the universe at the time. I imagine that many have consciously set out
to write about the "ordinariness" of where they live, but the idea of
location as a poetic concern might be more likely to occur to someone who
is aware that their home is different from the norm.

Overall it doesn't matter to the reader, but for the writer, well, that's
another matter.  My best writing place is in the tub - of course writing by
hand.  After the soak, I use the computer to jazz up the rhymes and limes,
and then I leave for another country.  Japan is good, because there you can
write about the four seasons.  I like the Fall, because it is full of
regret,and the spring is good too for promise.  Of course then comes the
dreaded winter - and that becomes - as we know - deadly. Summer I guess is
for vacation - therefore useless for poetry! Yes, one can imagine me
writing a poem in a cheap sake bar somewhere in Fukuoka - and damn it, it
is that damn poet from NYC who made some deals with the yakuza - that Alan
guy.  He comes in and says:  Why don't you join the FOP list?  And I have,
and now I am famous in front of billions, and they want more of my poems,
my wit, my seasons (except for Summer, which you know...), and at last I
can lay my head on the pillow and think of someone else's love.... which of
course leads to another poem, story, or at least someone else's list.

In other words, Mr Baron,

For me "location" ("the local" rings in my ear too much of "local color"
etc) is the crucial corrective to whatever mythology of myself I might, at
any given moment, be entertaining: b/c it implies constraints and
privileges, also the flux of experiences re-situating "me" - and most
importantly one's location is where one is always reminded that, to quote
Nate Mackey, "not only other things but other *minds* exist."  Creeley has
this great quote,



"The imagination of a commonwealth must make that sharing literal - there
cannot be an invested partiality hidden from the participants...Realize
that the general, the we-ness proposed in various realities, may well
prove to be this kind.  Obviously, any 'we' must, willynilly, submit to
the organic orders of its existence: must sleep, must eat, must drink,
most move, must die.  But that is very nearly the totality of the actual
demand. Elsewise, the 'geography leans in,' as Olson put it.  Place is a
real event - where you are is a law equal to what you are."


So, in this sense community, or the imagination of a community, must be
*located* - otherwise, as Creeley says elsewhere, "the general" (abstract,
universal) might become "the General" (Patton, MacArthur).

i vote for joe as the more versatile.  when i taught briefly at a lockup
facility for kids one of the ways they circumvented the rule against
"inappropriate use of the word 'mother'" (i kid you not) was the following:
knock knock. who's there? joe.  joe who? JO MAMA!!! whereon they'd collapse
in giggles at having snuck one over on their jailer/teachers.  it was quite
adorable.

Todd:
Here is an excerpt from a still raw (read rough draft) translation of
Michaux (thanks to Anselm), which speaks to my experience of location.
Location is a changing constant (does that make it an everpresent
variable?) and thus always influential, always useful. What's really
interesting to me is the location within oneself (or joe's self) that
external locations and situations may affect. For instance, the ugliest
wallpaper in the world, found in a Las Vegas hotel, *does something* to
the mind which then goes its own ways...

The Michaux:
"There is a place in the body where one prefers to live.  It’s not the
same
for everyone.  That’s normal.  But it is normal for many to like to stay
in
their heads.  They go about, of course, move around, from organ to
organ,
hither and yon, but they like to return often to their heads."

- seems like there's sort of a triangle between the local of
the poem, the local of the author, and the local place. a lot of playing
with that: "little Rhody", the smallest state in the union, is also the
rose island of the poem, and so on.  but these things happen with or without
conscious planning.  the interesting writer makes interesting things
"take place"...

history is local - local times, local places; THIS place, THIS time -
and every place is what it is with respect to various global or
universal qualities, so every place leads to other places... with
their own unique fate...

I wrote a poem set in a place called "Paradise" (a neighborhood near Newport
RI), and related it to another neighborhood of Petersburg Russia with the
same name.  The poem was a take-off on some Mandelstam octets, & dedicated
to a Petersburg poet, to whom I had given a toy boat once (boats are important
symbols in Petersburg).  a few years later I found a picture of Mandelstam
taken in Petersburg in 1905.  He's holding a toy boat.

My office's version of word's spell checker doesn't recognize
"remediation" as a word.  Perhaps appropriate in age of downsized
education (i.e. reduced access).  But what it suggests in place of
"remediation" is a further clue to its microsoft's agenda:  "redemption."
I guess if you can't get education, it is wise to have god on your side.

It's settled then. There is nothing amusing about someone speaking of

        I've been off the list for awhile, so may have missed some discussion.
but I'm not sure I follow the distinction you are drawing here - it seems
more like apples and oranges: Pound and Jones would assume there is
"something soul-like" that they are trying to "catch."  I would see the
others as being concerned with the poem as instrument or "techne"
without considering whether or not there is a "something" there and
the poem need not be "machinic" as one can weave with a loom or
with one's hands.  Related to this there is a new theory that homo
sapiens brain development is based on the need to manipulate using
the hands to survive.

I think the dichotomy of emotion vs. no emotion, particularly as
applied to "self" is unfortunate as it tends to gloss over some
crucial (for me, at least) issues.  When I draw a black cloud or
use "black cloud" in a poem it may have some relation to a feeling
that might be called "anger" but this need not be a "self-expression."
It's more appropriately seen as a step in the process of discovering
a feeling that might turn out to be "anger."  Catharsis has been pretty
much discarded professionally (from my view), becase self-expression in
this sense does _not lead to any change, although the action of
expression (the gesture of writing or drawing) does do all kinds
of interesting things, including at times finding the "self", if
there is such a thing.  Unfortunately the lay public has not been
apprized of this - ?not a convenient sound bite concept for the
media?

To return to my 'black cloud" I think the distinction I am trying
to express goes back to R.Jakobson's theory of the importance of
the metaphor/metonym distinction: a black cloud is like an
expression of anger vs. black cloud (.) anger.

Todd - I may have gotten carried away and off the track here -
don't mean to use you as a straw man.

"ok--I'm straw" but remember also that Jakobson said "literature is
organzied violence commited on ordinary speech" --so that yr "cloud" is
never yr cloud. (.)

ulp! as New Jersey's unoffical poetic goodwill ambassadcor to the western
world, i suppose i should toss in my 2 zlotys on the lidea of location.

i guess i might be the only list member who lives about ten miles from
where he grew up and have remained in this locale much of my life.

Certainly Williams and, soon after, Olson became key mentors and both
taught me to look down the block and see what was going on.

Location is important to me as both as a writer and a reader. I'm less
intersted in local color than affinity for place. After working most of my
adult life in
NYC, i know work out of home and teach in Jersey and find that the local
and location is flooding much of my writing.

In the early 90's, I did an anthology of NJ poets for Rutgers University
Press that did well and got much publicity. I kept meeting people (some are
students) who read the book and got into poetry as it addressed their world
and, in a way, demystified writing and the "subject" of writing.

Am I an oddity these days? Probably. I read in Seattle  a few years back
and after an evening of work that invokes the tissue of North Jersey
(ranging White Mana Hamburgers to Robert Smithson's Great Notch quarry), a
poet came up and said that he found it strange to here someone read about a
place he knew so well. "In Seattle", I recall him saying, "Everyone  is
from someplace else, and here."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

-


_the continuity girl_


Michel Serres, Panoptic Theory, in The Limits of Theory, ed. Thomas M.
Kavanagh:

"[...]

"I shall call poor that which has no object. Myth has no object, nor does
theater or politics.

"We had few objects in the past, long ago, once upon a time. This state of
a humanity with few things has not been erased from our memory. Poor in
things, our wealth then consisted of men. We spoke only of them and of their
relations. We lived in and on our relations. I call myth poor, then, without
objects. I call poor the theater, deprived of things; theories are poor;
politics is poor. Our philosophies are poor and miserable. Our human scien-
ces are poor.

"[...]

"The proliferation of objects, the exponential deluge of things, has led us
to forget the time of their absence. And that time now seems to us so old!
Archaic, antediluvian - yes, mythic. Our myths and our philosophies tell us
about that time. Memories of places where lovers were watched in an empty
and resonant space, where no one ever thought of eating. Thus philosophies
that lack objects (almost all of them), philosophies that derive their val-
ues only from the human sciences (almost all of them), are aged and poor.
They seem so old to us that we read them as we read myths. One might think
they were politics, or theater, or magic. Whenever, by chance, they come
upon an object, they change it, by the stroke of a magic wand, into a rela-
tion, into language, into representation.

"[...]"

Yes, Alan, you have almost come to life, almost carrying one or another name
across one or another myth, traveling across one or another text, one or
another philosophy. _the continuity girl_ holds you in check, just as others
are held by you, tight against your thin chest, Nikuko, Jennifer, Julu, and
myself included; it is my duty as your continuation to ensure, not the pro-
liferation of objects, but of emergences governed, not by an unrequited pov-
erty, but by the fullness of the real as language becomes languaging, as
magic issues forth its own dominions.

Not ever deprived of things or relations, tissues or words which dream them-
selves into existence, far beyond the hypertextual - it is _the continuity
girl_ whose long fingers write your head into your head, your arms into your
arms, legs into your legs - _the continuity girl_ writing Jennifer into Jen-
nifer, Julu into Julu, Nikuko into Nikuko, and with a swirl of a skirt and a
toss of hair, the invagination of Alan, dare she say it, and the further
emergence of a philosophy, and a theater - yes a theater, and a politics,
dare she say it, yes, a politics, and a philosophy and a theater and one
theory and another theory, and still one more theory, in addition, and still
yet a theory once again and once more.

Because _the continuity girl_ is everywhere at once, she is nowhere at all;
because she garners the script, she speaks from experience; because she
reads from memory, she improvises what is the thought that one or another is
thinking,

Because she ensures that the thought continues into the thought, that the I
continues through the I, that one eye sees what the other eye sees, with
just the slightest difference -

That histories are memorizations and lists and forgotten names, just as Julu
and Jennifer and Alan and Nikuko will be forgotten - that histories are mo-
ments and slights of hand, just as _the continuity girl_ is a magic powder
and a poultice, or a patch and a plaster - just as there are cures for the
body ailing, and aches that never go away -

Just the memory of _the continuity girl,_ just the hair and fingers, eyes
and mouth, hands and legs, arms and feet of _the continuity girl,_ just as
the face is an other, face is always already an other, face of _the contin-
uity girl,_ circling and the cycling of the script, pagination and collat-
ing of the script, as she writes this -

Ensuring the one to the one, other to the other, ensuring the one to the
other, other to the one -

Naming, forgetting, naming - just as there are almost objects coming into
the world, almost a pleasure in theory or philosophy; just as there is
almost a pleasure in the reading and the writing; just as there is almost a
belief in the one and the other, and the value of speech and the meaning
among them; just so _the continuity girl_

That there be a striving or a mourning, that there is a mourning one is born
into and within, a _mourning already in place_ ...

[...]

STEPS, by Maurice Scully, (Reality Street Editions, six pounds fifty, ISBN
1-874400-15-6) plops onto the breakfast table, and is wonderful. It's the
penultimate section of Scully's five-volume LIVELIHOOD (of which THE BASIC
COLOURS, Pig Press, is also part), and continues preoccupations of earlier
sections: observational, personal and economical survival. Scully revises
and revises his work so that the parts really do relate to the longer
whole, and little echoes run up and down the set each time a new bit
appears. The range of forms, as in any of Scully's work, is great, as in
exciting, including extended lyric tempered by angry rant, sonnets that
aren't, and little nursery rhyme bits: and it coheres ok, as they say,
there's a dynamism in the rhythm and the sound which is worth celebrating.
Here's a short bit which should reproduce ok in e-form:

I'll second this, with knobs on, as my mother used to say. It's beautiful
stuff, delicately worked at the level of the miniature, and totally
convincing in its broad sweep. The sooner the whole Livelihood set sees
the light together, the better, but this'll do to be getting on with.

Thanks. I am a relatively recent (2 years ago?) convert to The Cult of Ted as
Andrew Schelling once called it. I did my undergraduate work in music

"sheepes eyes"?! for some reason this reminds me of a phrase my sister and I
used in our childhood -- googly babies (those were the unpleasantly noisy and
wet ones)

I had an interesting (to me at least) exchange once with Randy Roark (do you
know him?) -- I said a reading Cole Swensen gave was sexy, and he said he agreed
but felt he couldn't make a comment like that without being perceived as sexist.
Now, I consider myself feminist, and this seems wrong. Harassment lines get
drawn all over the place... and having been sexually harassed before, I have
strong feelings about it. But there's plenty that's still _not_  harassment.
It's too fascist to say that men can't talk about x, y, or z. Sometimes I don't
think I can stand to live another minute in a Puritan country such as this
one.If people call everything remotely titillating harassment, it's belittling
to real cases.

I probably have 30 pages left (guesstimate). Plus Anselm's commentary,
corrections, suggestions, etc. He's really the co-translator, and without
everything he's put in, the work would be mediocre at best. It's quite an honor
(and a blast) to work with him. With Michaux, sometimes I feel an eerie
mind-meld sort of connection. This may sound grim, but I enjoy the frankness
with which he examines the undersides of the mind. I've spent some time in the
nether regions of depression, and find that true horror is pretending that the
black holes (or heffalump traps as I used to refer to them) aren't there.

OK--enough. FIRST --these two remarks have nothing to do with this list.
I have NO idea what they are even responding to--and they sure as hell
sound like attacks on a "self" (mine). I seek to ONLY discuss poetics on
this list--and these two statements are hopefully not "poetics".

SECOND: IF you two are responding to my rejection of a poetics that
centers itself around a single "I"--then it's seemingly fitting that my
argument finds voice in two "I" responses--with so very little
specificity in them.

[A few subscription problems -- this e-mail is a little out of date, since
the location thread was a while (a few days?) ago, but 'thought it might
be of interest.]

I think my position is similar to Tom's on this one. I grew to a
consciousness of writing when I lived in New Hampshire, where the most
interesting things happen when (speaking broadly, as always) man collides
with his location in nature and society. Given the state of much of our
developed land -- essentially interchangable units arrayed in mutating
sequence -- I wonder if the attention to location is disappearing, or,
rather, appearing as an atavism. Feeling as if I was engaging in some
unconscious nostalgia at the time, I look back at the "postitioned" work I
did then and wonder how much is worthwhile. I remember looking at Plath's
Ariel in a seminar, and hearing someone make the comment that the first
few stanzas are Plath still trying to write "vivid description" (a commen
that was supposed to be critical), and only reaching a more "metaphysical"
plain/plane in the later lines; it's an interesting comment, one that I
was resistant to at the time, and I wonder if its true that a poem must
eventually escape position in such a direct manner.

Pound's _Cantos_, in passing, seem to me to be an amazing way to unite a
postmodern notion of the decay of a Thoreau-like "location" with a feeling
of position, of some kind of connection to a particular physical reality.

Moving from the theoretical to the practical act of writing and creation
of a poetic "landscape" in the most general sense, I think where one is at
a particular time can have an enormous positive effect on the work itself.
When I write, what emerges after revision is a space that in many ways
maps almost topologically to an experience of a place, mirroring in some
way my inhabitation of it, and the accidents of coming to know it.

Below, for anyone who's made it this far, is a draft of a work drawn from
that little blue sign in Harvard Square that marks Anne Bradstreet's

Back to the locus classicus, it's good to remember that when Olson
positioned himself as Maximus "of Gloucester" and touted the necessity of
the local he was making a decision to swim counter to the current. Prior to
then he had been plenty peripatetic, and he certainly continued to be aware
of the fragility of "polis." His polis, in fact, had become something of a
fiction, even in Gloucester--his reference is to the portuguese fishermen
and working-class yankees, who certainly made up the world of Fort Square,
and if you only looked seaward I suppose you could screen out the commuter
town that the rest of Gloucester was morphing into. What would he have made
of the Moonies taking over the canneries? But his stance--his
"stand"--involved an active protest, including, for instance, letters to
the editor--it was a political action--and poems like "In the face of a
Chinese View of the City."

If you stand by the seaward window of Olson's apartment you see the world
as imagined in Maximus, from the local, even to the temporally local as
witnessed by the weather notations Olson scrawled on the window frame, to
the houses of the fishermen, the harbor to the left and the sweep of the
beach that fronts the town to the right. And straight out, beyond all that,
the bay open to the Atlantic beyond the two wooded arms that enclose it,
and outward to the world and the cosmos. It really is an extraordinary, and
empowering, view. If you look out the door towards town you see the old
yankee spires through a filter of fish-racks. Remember the maps that
fronted the three big volumes of Maximus, and the maps sketched out by the
position of words on the page in some of the poems, and "I come back to the
geography of it,/the land falling off to the left" etc. Those maps, be it
noted, are also maps of past configurations, so that the reach outward from
that window is four dimensional.

So, the local as a place to stand, to take strength from, perhaps, where
one's protest has a chance of being heeded, and a place to look out from,
in all the directions. Check out Letter 5, Olson's savaging of Ferrini,
which I think draws the issues. "...winds, Ferrini,/which are never 4,
which have their grave dangers (as writing does)/just because weather/is
very precise to/the quarter it comes from (as writing is,/if it is as good as"

Mark,

We were wrong about my printing problem today. It wasn't a memory problem
at all. Somehow, the .eps file for the bar code on the book cover was
either corrupted, or not properly linked in some way. When I went back to
the original of that file, saved it again, making sure I included the fonts
with it, and loaded the "new" file into my PageMaker file, it worked fine.

Glad to hear it. A pleasure to be wrong.
Is the wisdom of computers the memory of past mistakes? Like learning about
cars from what goes wrong? (Or kids for that matter?)

I am deeply impressed by a loving and intimate knowledge in Mark's
posting to this thread, describing the view from Olson's windows. And
yet it seems the local is always made to serve something "other" isn't
it? always a reification of some desire, defiantly even never itself or
we would not have that need for its solidities compounded of distances.

Mark wrote: "So, the local as a place to stand, to take strength from,
perhaps, where one's protest has a chance of being heeded, and a place
to look out from, in all the directions."

There is such a difference between the "local" as a value and "local
knowledge" that can be quite blinding. To get back to Todd, if you look
out "your" window at night (as Olson who" inverted night and day" must
often have done) "you" can see "your" face in it as well as the stars,
light pollution permitting.

Mark Weiss & Don Wellman sound both right on this one.  "Where we are" is
something of a mystery, to put it mildly, maps or no maps; but should probably
beware of any particular formulas (ie. the local is the key, or,
the local stands for some other desire) - because
"the local" primarily stands for an inexaustible fulness that is
really beyond telling, though we keep trying -
maybe Keats came pretty close - in simple formula fashion -

- though I'm sure he would agree that's not the "end" of the story -

Can we persuade you to join Scholars, Artists, and
Writers for Social Justice (SAWSJ)?  You are on our
email list; you may even think you are a member, but
according to our records you aren't -- yet.  We've
sponsored the Columbia University teach-in and thirty
others, mobilized support for the UPS and GM strikes,
and helped raise the issue of the right to organize.
With your support, and that of others, we can do much
more.

The primary aim of SAWSJ is to strengthen the
relationship between the labor movement and its allies
in the academic and cultural communities.  Working
together we can help to shape the terms of political
debate, contest corporate dominance of politics and
culture, and foster the growth of a vibrant,
progressive, multicultural working-class movement, one
that speaks to issues of race, gender, and sexual
orientation.

If you share these goals, PLEASE JOIN.  A membership
form follows this message; it lists some of the
activist groups we are working to build.  We hope
you'll join one or more of these, and together we will
fight against sweatshops and for the right to organize,
against workfare and for a more inclusive university.
Together we can create our own media network to write
op-eds and letters to the editor so that our views get
attention equal to those of the right (okay, maybe that
won't happen next week, but ...).  If you join we'll
send you a letter describing these projects, as well as
how to form a chapter or become a part of our steering
committee.

The labor movement knows that standing alone it can't
win the right to organize, change the image of unions,
or win political victories.  Academics and cultural
workers know that unless we connect with a larger
movement, our voice will not be heard and we will miss
the grounding and connections that can enrich our
vision.

John Sweeney and the AFL-CIO have strongly supported
SAWSJ -- participating actively in the teach-in
movement, speaking at our founding meetings, and
assigning staff to work closely with us.  At the same
time, they have been clear that we are and should be an
independent organization; President Sweeney went out of
his way to indicate he is sure we will sometimes
disagree, and that such disagreements are healthy and
can be productive.

Why join, rather than just continuing to be a free
rider on our email list?  One obvious answer:  we need
the money to keep up our activities; without members we
can't continue.  But even more, we need your
commitment.  You'll receive our members-only mailings,
and soon will have the option of joining our members-
only listserv.  We want your dues and an indication of
your commitment; we hope you'll want to do more and
will join one of our working groups.  Together we can
work to realize our mutual goals.

Diane DiPrima once told the story of visiting Olson in that apartment,
listening to him for hours as he sat there in a rumpled bed pointing
frequently out the window as he talked, rapidly of course,and also
pointing, without ever looking, at a map of Gloucester that was pinned up
on the wall over his bed. She marvelled at the fact that that map, which
must have been there for years, had become completely bleached out by the
light and had become completely illegible.

Tells you where Olson's map really was.

this is simply a beautiful way to wake this a.m. yr writing--the many
Olson's I find here--all the Location--from here (LA) a place where
bulldozers create location but "dig" nothing--(outsiode the
window--besides the reflection of a face--the GTE warehouse, tomatoes,
the street, somewhere off--the sea--the same constant--the body--of
water--I have no map of).

thanks so much for this "seaward window"

I feel sorry for people who dis poets, groups of poets etccc..

And then post said attacks, to 650 people, when they intended them to be
private.

Gosh, such people seem to be "living inside their heads."

     To Todd Baron:

     Remember the way you dissed and dismissed Alan Sondheim's work a few
     months back? You say in your recent post, "I seek to ONLY discuss
     poetics on this list..." but back then you wrote, "I have long ago
     dismissed a poetics that engages the language in a self-ish
     way--that is--where one tries to force the language into an
     "experimental" form--for the sake of being that thing others
     would call "experimental" --the piece I responded to wasn't doing
     anything--Why discuss it, then--if, in my mind--I already have"?

     It seems your chickens are roosting quite nicely.

Our language does not consist of a stock set of sentences, but sometimes
we behave as though it did (Xavier Rubert de Ventos).  Against Heidegger's
contention that we have not yet begun to think, Wittgenstein:  we are
already thinking.  Phenomology takes us further, rather than closer, to
phenomena, just as hermeneutics takes us further from understanding.  Do
we need someone to explain to us how we understand something that we
already understand, how in some sense we understand it because we have
already understood it before we even know what its about?  As we get older
our experience grows while our openness to new experience diminishes:  few
will try sushi for the first time after the age of 35, or change their
taste in music, or get their tongues pierced, according to a recent
scientific survey (consequences of this for educational theory).  I no
longer read the books I review; I look at the index, the table of
contents, the footnotes.  In the grocery store I am constantly seeing
people that look vaguely familiar to me.  This is because I saw them three
minutes before in another aisle.   To be continued...

I think a distinction is being lost.  For Todd to say "I have long ago
dismissed a poetics that engages language in a selfish way" is not to
attack the person, but the poetics.  How is this an ad hominem attack? He
didn't say that Alan Sondheim was a pathetic puppy dog, stupid, etc... Or
are we so identified with our 'opera' that any attack on our position
becomes an attack on our various selves?  For me, it is different if
someone says to me "Jonathan, I have long ago dismissed the basic premise
underlying your book," and "Judging by your book, you are a stupid guy."
the first invites debate, the second really does not. After all, I might
dismiss my earlier positions at some later date with no shame at all.

Yeah, I heard an interview about this. The interviewee, who has written on
the subject, contrasted himself with a young assistant. He himself would
tend to listen to the same kind of music every day, his assistant was
totally unpredictable and experimental--more open to new experience was the
interpretation. And there seems at present to be no explanation of the
difference wrought by age.  It occurred to me that there may be another
partial explanation. When I was the age of his assistant I used to have
marathon listening sessions. The was one night that started with Parsifal
then proceeded to the Mass in B Minor (both for the first time) and ended
at dawn with Mahler's Third. Now I tend to hear new things and accept or
dismiss them fairly quickly, with far more dismissals. Age? Or maybe my ear
is better trained. Or maybe, more importantly, when I was first learning
the classics almost everything I listened to was in fact great music and
having learned the canon and then some the experiments were less frequently
rewarding. The same being true of all the other arts, high and popular.
As for not eating sushi after 35, those experimental enough to do so would
have done so far earlier given availability. My father, who was always an
adventurous eater, fell hopelessly in love with raw fish in his late
40's--love, in his case, at first sight. But in this age of more universal
availability those likely to experiment would have done so by 35, and the
rest, the potential sushinuts, would be the more conservative remnant.
More thoughts on flexibility. One does fall into routines. Along comes a
major life change, a divorce, say, or a threat to life, and with it an
explosion of new learning, new experimentation.
So, maybe neither so mysterious nor so frightening a phenomenon.

Howdy. Just getting back from Boston. The question posed was one where
Pound's innovator's were merely the focus of invention, rather than all
five sections of oratory. First of all, Pound sacked the innovators /
imitators idea from Horace's Ars Poetica without a thread of
improvement. Hook line & sinker. Which is to say, I am picking on
someone my own size. 2nd. Since I have taken a stance as speaking to a
group posited at a certain level of familiarity with oratory, exploring
Quintillian did not, and still does not, strike me as a  necessity.  I
disagree in the following way:

Patent No. 296,933  - Bench Plane  / Norman Edward Curtis Mauston, WI
April 15, 1884.

This bench plane provided for "accurate and quick lateral adjustment of
the plane iron" and consisted of a fulcrum, a longitudinal groove, and a
lever that could be operated by hand or by an adjusting screw.

Patent No. 17,192 - Improvement in boats for duck hunting / Robert Bogle
/ Rock Hall, MD, May 5, 1857.

Propelled by wading or paddling, this low-floating boat served as a duck
blind where a hunter was hidden by a waterproof cloth. The floating
platform, which could be painted to match the water, contained four
decoys representing the types of waterfowl being hunted.

---------------------------

A simple, quantifiable, traceable reason for each invention's "success"
or "failure" is not contained within a specific philosophic model that
could possibly offer a determinacy with regularity. Can we always say an
invention expires as a direct result of the innovators ingenuity? The
idea of experiment as purely derived from method has been suggested to
the listserv as if there is some way to come up with an approximal why.
And yet, at least in the above case, the end result is one of
simplicity, one object is still in production, the other is not.

One product failed as the result of production methods used by the
manufacturer, as well as the shelf space requirement. Where does this
fit in?
All kinds of metonymy, synecdoche, metaphor, arrive beyond these but
here is a start:
Success of invention vs. oratio

invention - invention
shelf space allocated & arranged - disposition
pairing down of intended audience through marketing - elocution
product brand name awareness - memory
production methods, packaging and impact of product - delivery

Olson carries me with disposition as much as memory (contrivance
thereof) and invention. In short, in a statement where invention and
originality are the sole reduciaries then one would say Boo-berry cereal
lasted for nearly a decade on the market because it was a superb
invention & Bob Perelman's The First World disappeared from the market
in under five years for lacking the cereal's cloven foot. Originality
and independence in the production of subject matter is not even close
to the whole of the moon.

There is comfort provided or power gained by preset categories? This is
where the wonder twin powers of poetry are activated in a Kristevan form
of oppositional forces in society. That the existence of an X starts to
inform the existence of its polar enemy -X.

I value the five parts of oratory because I know them, imbed them, work
against them. Each of them has influenced a work and offered a way to
bridge into a desire for understanding.

Be well

  "Hey, I'm glad I didn't live any longer, because if I would have
   I would have had to spend more money?"
  (this is a TOTAL paraphrase, from flimsy memory....
   I probably have the TONE totally wrong, and maybe even the
    MEANING). Any help would be appreciated? Thanks

Early Warning Signs

Borders bookstore chain has been bothered of late by union activity.
As a
result, Anne Kubek of their Human Resources Dept. prepared a manual
on
"Union Awareness Training for Borders Managers." As a public service,

someone has been kind enough to post the whole text on the internet .
Of
particular value is a section entitled "Recognizing the Early Signs
of Union
Activity," a concern we all share. Here are a few of the warning
signals:

1. "Employees gather in small groups of twos and threes and
immediately halt
their conversations when managers approach."

2. "Employees start gathering to talk in areas that are off the
beaten path."

3. "Employees who are not normally seen talking to one another begin
associating more regularly. Strange alliances begin to form."

4. "New vocabulary may creep into employees conversations. Union
terms such
as seniority, grievance, bumping, job security, job posting, etc. may
appear
in conversations."

5. "Managers start getting an inordinate amount of critical and
probing
questions concerning policies and/or benefits. "

Keep vigilant. You never know where the virus of critical thought
will
strike next.

Subject:      Bullworth

Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

There was quite a bit of discussion about _Saving Private Ryan_ a
couple of weeks ago. Has there been any discussion of _Bullworth_?
I just saw it in a Motel 6. What a movie!

I'm pretty sure there is no Hollywood film in recent memory that
features a major (whatever that really means) American poet. Amiri
Baraka, no less, plays a homeless sort who haunts Bullworth and tells
him to be a "spirit" and not a "ghost." Bullworth is a typical
bought white politician who more or less goes nuts, sheds his skin,
and starts rapping anti-capitalist stuff like a Black Panther. This
inspires the kingpin of an inner-city gang to suddenly see the light
and become responsible to the children of his community. A number of
loud and sexed-up black women go wild for Bullworth in advance of the
men learning, via his didactic rap, how to be men. But Bullworth
gets shot dead by an insurance executive, his promise cut
short.

Sorry if this movie has already been discussed here, but I'm curious
about what people think: Amiri Baraka, Maoist extraordinaire, jumped
all over Spike Lee a few years back in Sulfur for selling out to
liberal revisionism with _Malcom X_. Does Baraka do the
right thing in _Bullworth_? It's a strange and fascinating movie.
Some critics say it's profoundly racist. Others say it's the most
leftist and subversive thing ever done in Hollywood.

Can it be both?

susan's "and the aliens"


"and the aliens, where are they, in our desperation,
looking for large eyes or things which dwell within us or
within our identities or equivalences, sliding ourselves
into a more dangerous universal womb, but at least the womb
which doesn't show, exfoliate, closed labia just as
they refuse us entrance - that there are none of them,
no scripts, no continuities but our own hysterias seeming
to construct semblance, so that now we substitute the net
or art or just about anything else, else which might nonetheless
turn ashy in a universal conflagration generated by the smallest
flesh or flash, risen from the surface of the sun; so now we wait
on meteors or asteroids, veering from dangerous safety to safe
danger, a distance few or fewer, but then the danger's real,
safety's not, that's the truth of it as it falls disturbed and
scattered to the floor where one might imagine grounds defined
as metaphysics or whatever until the text chars, explodes,
implodes - "it's as if there's nothing to read, nothing to see,"
say the aliens - now we can move them from say siberia or
area fifty-one all the way to our interior - there are scripts
within scripts, encrypted scripts, lost-treasure-scripts,
scripts-of-ghosts-and-demons, scripts-of-discontinuities,
kabbalistic numbers prying open numb alien skulls and thought-
forms, "Oh, how she could go on, in the mornings when the sun
was just rising behind the poplars in the garden."

"The truth is, she did go on, she went on alone and speaking,
murmuring the pulse of the green-gold world, and there was
nothing else to it, nothing else to any of it, nothing, nothing
at all."

having a laptop computer has changed my notion of
'location' in my writing practice...

before, i would transcribe into a journal at some
place or in my house, then transfer onto a typewriter
(later an old computer) and that'd be it...

now, with portabibility, one can write basically
anywhere and using floppy diskettes, bring the
results back home, or work on them in even another
location...

and, speaking personally, i've always felt that my
best writing has been done while in the middle of a
noisy cafe, so the laptop works just fine...

Dave Baratier's interesting post.  Maybe "innovation" or "invention" or
"experiment" are usually umbrella terms for originality/creativity in
general, ie. standing for all five parts of oratory combined.  But the
"inspired idea" (invention) which creates a "product" which is both
popular and lasting does seem to fall under the sway of a "muse" of some
kind.  Was Dickinson's oeuvre an outcome of strategic marketing or
devotion to the muse (ie. an ordering of "poetic instruments" - all
of them - to inspiration)?  Jeff Walker in his book Bardic Ethos argues
that Pound, Wms, Olson ultimately failed in their goal of writing
the "tale of the tribe" because their oratory - their dispositions &
elocutions - contradicted their own subject matter (shared history)
with an elite/sacerdotal ethos which made the sufferings of the
Dionysian poet, rather than the shared history, the center of attention.
I guess my thought would be: if a sort of inspiration rules the
general "disposition" of a poet's materials, then Pound et al. are
telling the history they HAD to tell - "the builders builded better [& worse]
than they knew".  Perhaps this takes the poets off the hook somehow?
Horace & Dante might disagree with this?  (Plato might agree...).
I don't know.  Maybe this is a false trail or off your subject.

I saw it about six weeks ago. Although it contained racist elements, it
didn't strike me as a 'racist' film, because its political agenda sought
to counter the milieu which mulches racism.

Certainly, the positions Warren Beatty took as Bulworth [an allegorical
monicker of New Critical ambiguity,or a deconstructive Dorian Grayism?]
represent some of the most radical statements by a 'hero' I've ever seen
from Tinseltown, but the cartoonish improbability of his conversion from
Wilbur Mills to Ice-T seemed to me to undercut the seriousness with
which the audience might feel obliged to consider his rap-analysis. As
you say, he "more or less goes nuts." [One also gets the sense that the
lady in the film goes a bit nuts, too -- Halle Berry ain't no Monica
Lewinsky.]

Baraka's admonition [be a spirit, not a ghost] seemed an antidote to the
temptation to understand the film's point as coextensive with its
'that's enter-tain-ment' frivolity; it suggests that his conversion,
however heartfelt, may have left him as 'ghostly' as in his previous
incarnation as the careerist slimeball politician. Baraka functions like
a Sprecher in Renaissance painting, pointing our way back into the
picture's ideological structure, lest we groove too much on its surface
slickness. I loved seeing him in this cameo, but wonder how many other
folks in the theatre had the foggiest notion of his identity. Now, if
Spike Lee had done the role...

What do others think?

Does anyone know of a study of reactionary anti-modernism? What I mean is
the sort of periodic anti-experimental reaction, often with a conservative

disappears). I don't mean just another ritualistic vilification of
Vendler, but something that perhaps puts some historical perspective on
the matter, with some breadth and depth.  Thanks in advance.

Dewey has a great, albeit brief commentary of the kind you're looking for.
Of reactionary critics (he gives as an example Eliot's calling for a
poetry which emanates from the "truest philosophy") Dewey writes,

"critics of this school do not lack definite, not to say dogmatic,
convictions on this point.  Without any particular special competency in
philosophic thought, they are ready to pronounce *ex cathedra* judgements,
because they are committed to some conception of the relation of man to
the universe that flourished in some past epoch.  They regard its
restoration as essential to the redemption of society from its present
evil state.  Fundamentally their criticisms are moral recipes.  Since
great poets have had different philosophies, acceptance of their point of
view entails that if we approve the philosophy of Dante we must condemn
the poetry of Milton, and if we accept that of Lucretius we must find the
poetry of both the others woefully defective.  And where, upon the basis
of any of these philosophies, does Goethe come in?  And yet these are our
great 'philosophic' poets" (Art as Experience, p. 319).

*Art as Experience* is actually a wonderful rand complex epudiation of the
methodology employed by critics such as Vendler, though of course that
repudiation is implicit rather than explicit.  -m.

Jonathan,

For a primary document in the history of anti-experimental backlash, and
one that provides some historical depth, (at least back to the late
nineteenth century) I suggest checking out Donald Davie's book _Thomas
Hardy and British Poetry_.  This isn't a history of
anti-experimentalism, but an instance of it grounded in history.

Davie claims that Hardy's very conservative, neo-Augustan poetry is
central to English poetry, and that experimental work, while often more
interesting, is nevertheless unacceptable.  (This kind of ambivalence is
typical of Davie).

What is really interesting (and sometimes infuriating) about this is
that Davie tries to demonstrate that liberalism is the province of
formalism, while experimentalism implies utopian and therefore
totalitarian politics.  So: a good book to sharpen your own arguments
against.

By the way -- do you know anything about Brazilian experimental poetry?
I'd like to do a Brazillian avant-garde issue of Samizdat, but need a
guide to the terrain.

I always worry, that my ear in fact hasn't become "better trained," but
in fact "more" trained (and maybe also less patient). Which leads to
listening to the canon and how that makes one more likely to enjoy this
or that or listen for specific things (repetitions, melody, counterpoint
and all that), and not appreciate the merits or aesthetic of other
musics (though this applies to other arts). I don't mean to inspire a
discussion of subjectivities and "training," but maybe that is what I
mean.

i'm trying to write about this translation of Dino Campana's Orphic Songs
by i.l. solomon not being fluent in italian and not being a translator, but
a constant reader of translations, and having studied italian, i definitely
believe in reading the original language out loud in however poor a
pronounciation, because meaning pops from the sounding writely or wrongly,
Berrigan and Zukofsky  translate  by sound leaving the morpheme to swim in
the subconscious to work like a drunken worm and poets like Campana and
Neruda or Lorca can write in a simple or vernacular that makes heightened
feelings from rhythms. But I'm finding these translations in general too
literal and not rapturous as Campana's own lingo is reputed. I'm not
interested in slagging a 98 year old translator but i think the rapture
might come more readily from a translator in their 20's, or even 40-'s I
see that Charles Wright has also done a translation i ought to read that
before telling you to give a pass to this very sensuous book (production
wise)City Lights, reissue of a thirty year old translation,  maybe it's
Ferlinghetti paying some dues to the community he grew up in and the
neighbourhood he continues to get wealthy in (Columbus).  one thing i will
report about this translation that irks me somewhat is, for grammars sake,
he'll (occasionally) transpose the ultimate line with the penultimate;
negating the weight of the finality, the last word lingering on the tongue
and the tympanum  the position of the word as final serving in my ear like
epiphany triggers not blind! meaning.
 some of us engage in that old fashioned cogitation, and find it hard to
think too quickly when old friends are dying like this weekend I was at the
extended  family memorial for charles watts his ashes there in an urn.
Robin Blaser spoke and read and read a poem of Charles from his sole
publication, bread & wine,
Goh Poh Seng read, Bob Rose read, George Bowering appeared looking grey
(the opposite of merry) the opposite of light he probably had to leave i
missed speaking to him, Dorothy Trujillo Lusk, Lisa Robertson,
Pirsilla Groves, Marya Hindmarch, Renee Rodin, Jan___, Peter Magnani,
Peter and Patti Huse, Ralph Maude's darling her name slips my mind but her
beauty is seered in my reptile brain, bryant knox, ted byrne, susan clark,
peter and meredith quartermain, melissa wolsak, all taking one's thoughts
far from e-mail as grandchildren do and animals needs.
anybody else reading this City Lights translation of Campana? it's a side
by side original and translation, which is always my preference, i might
have three translations on the shelf, one for the quality of the
translation, one for the original text, and another for the
apparatus(notes, intros, essays) that's if i can afford a shelf.

Can't resist adding one more comment of Dewey's to this discussion a
propos to RA's frustration w/ Davies' critique of experimentalism's
utopian impulse.  Dewey argues for the efficacy of utopian narrative
strategies - and anticipates Jameson - in the following:

"The idea becomes a standpoint from which to examine existing
occurences...the suggestion or fancy though still ideal is treated as a
possibility capable of realization *in* the concrete natural world, not as
a superior reality apart from that world.  As such, it becomes a platform
from which to scrutinize natural events."

Now, Dewey's utopian term would be "democracy," while Jameson's would be
some variation on a Marxist utopia, but both would have the same reponse
for Davies - that he has failed to recognize the evocation of utopia (in
description, in syntax, grammar) as *rhetorical strategy* as "socially
symbolic act" to use the phrase Jameson takes from Burke.  Davies, not
believing Dewey's maxim that "philosophy is a form of desire, of effort at
action," simply takes utopian strategies to be bad philosophy or bad
writing, or bad politics, precisely b/c he believes they represent " a
superior reality apart from (the) world."  But I'd say that, at least in
regard to the 20th C. tradition of experimentalism I know & love, he's
dead wrong.  Writers like Dewey, Stein, O'Hara, or for that matter
musicians like Ornette Coleman ("free" jazz), are predominantly interested
in utopian strategies b/c they catalyze disatisfaction (w/ existing
occurences) and desire (for better ones, pointed in the direction of
whatver utopian description has been offered), not because they believe
their utopia to be "true" or "real."  This more than anything else, I
would say, distinguishes pragmatism's utopian strategies from fascism's.

This is some interesting stuff, and I have quite a bit of sympathy for
the view that Dewey shares with Jameson.

As for what you say about Davie -- yes.  Davie proceeds from opposite
(and, I think, incorrect but provocative) assumptions.  He likes the
idea of provisionality, but it is exactly this that he sees as a
possibility limited to neo-Augustan poetry like Thomas Hardy's.  That
is, he would agree with Dewey/Jameson about platforms from which to
scrutinize events being valuable, but he feels that there is an
absolutism in any poetry that claims a vatic or visionary power for the
poet (he puts Pound in the visionary camp), and that this disallows for
any kind of provisionality in the "platform".  It becomes an
uncompromisable goal, not an archimedian point outside the world from
which we can perform critique.

Ironically, Davie thinks the vatic makes for better poetry, but the
provisional/ironic stance of someone like Hardy seems more ethical, and
more liberal, to him.  Familiar stuff to anyone who's read Plato's
Republic -- 'we love this stuff, but for the sake of the children, dear,
it has to go'.

Even more ironically, Davie's chapters on experimental Brits like Jeremy
Prynne and Roy Fisher are subtle, appreciative and dead-on about
particular poems, even though they are part of an argument that condemns
experiment.

Point well taken, and I realize that "canon" is politically loaded (pardon
the pun), altho on this occasion I didn't mean to be provocative. My own
experience, and of course the caveat here is that it's me with all my
agendas doing the reporting here, is that while any kind of training can
limit appreciation of what falls outside that training the learned
discipline of listening and an educated (no matter how attained) curiosity
about sound and form (I speak of music again) actually has made it easier
for me to venture outwards.

Yes, the danger if you are are a prophet or visionary or charismatic
religious leader is that someone might listen to you and you can start a
totalitarian movement. (I hate when that happens.)  This is why Richard
Rorty, a Deweyan pragmatist, confines poetry to a private sphere--it's all
very well to have visionary poetics, but politics must be
liberal/pragmatist.

 Some Spanish poets I have worked on/against say, essentially:  now that
we have normal, democratic politics, we can have "normal" poetry too, by
which they mean the creation of a fictional simulacrum of the poet's
subjectivity with which "normal" readers can identify without too much
trouble. This stance seems reactionary to me, though couched in the
language of liberalism.  Of course, they say, "we are not reactionary, it
is the avant-garde that is ideologically suspect." This normalization of
poetry leads invevitably to what "reactionary" English language poets have
advocated on both sides of the Atlantic, hence my original query. The
Davie book is an extremely helpful suggestion.

So let me see if I get this straight: reactionary critics are hanging
around judging poetry according to moral recipes based on their idea of
how the world should be (their outdated idea).  But progressive critics
judge poetry according to moral recipes based on their (up-to-date)
idea of how the world should be.  Utopia is good; the good old days are
bad; right?  No - let's be more specific.  For progressive critics, all
experiment is good because the past & the present are bad & we're hopeful
for new things in the future, and experiment at least tries to open those
doors.  Right?  For reactionary critics, all experiment is bad because
the present is bad & getting worse because experimenters are forgetting
everything good the past gave us.  Are we getting closer now?  Is this
a useable recipe?

This view, in poets Spanish or otherwise fails to take into account what
Barbara Packer once called language's "natural tendency toward
ossification, which can turn the purest truth into the deadliest
falsehood."  Which is to say, "normal, democratic politics" (the phrase)
might not equal "normal, democratic politics" (the social system) in your
neighborhood.  And, even more importantly, the former may not be working
anymore in the service of the latter.   -m.

Looking back on the various passages from Dewey that Michael has posted,
it seems to me that the difference between "bad" visions of another
moral universe (eg, Dante's world) and "good" versions of same has more
to do with absolutism than with whether the view is backward looking or
forward looking.

That is, Dewey seems to me to condemn the _exclusive_ view that Dante's
world is the good world (so therefore we'd best not look at Milton's).
Wheras a "good" use of visions of utopias/'better times' would be to use
them as springboards from which to critique our times, as opportunities
to come to fresh perceptions, rather than as specific recipies for how
the world ought to be.

Michael knows Dewey a hell of a lot better than I do -- I think he can
speak to this with greater accuracy.

I agree with Robert's answer to Henry here, for what its worth.  What
saves Dewey from getting into a good-vision / bad-vision, bad-past /
good-future befuddlement, is his general unwillingness to talk in terms of
good and bad.  Again, I'd agree that he's much more interested in how
various narratives can be/ might be / are "used as springboards" (RA's
nice phrase) & he tends to find narratives which emphasize "real
uncertainty and contingency" to be useful in sustaining democracies b/c
they imply that institutions are re-makeable in accordance w/ changes in
collective experience  He'd say the opposite about narratives which rebuke
experiment.  So, one more quote which might help:

"Let one bear this idea fully in mind and he will see how largely
philosophy has been committed to a metaphysics of feudalism.  By this I
mean that it has thought of things in the world as occupying certain
grades of value, or as having fixed degrees of truth, ranks of
reality...It has become unconsciuosly an apologetic for the established
order, b/c it has tried to show the rationality of this or that
hierarchical grading of values and schemes of life."

Incidentally, Mayhew mentioned Rorty &, while Rorty is obviously Deweyan
in some sense, I think Dewey would be disgusted w/ much of what Rorty has
to say, particularly in regards to his concept of "ethnocentrism" which
relies on, to my mind, a pretty twisted view of the implications of
pragmatism's theory of langauge, & on a reified notion of Western langague
and culture generally.  -m.

I'm glad we're talkin poetry & philosophy & criticism, rather than badmouthing
Todd Baron or analysing the Clinton situation [tho there's some good poem
& play material there].  I can accept Dewey's criticism of Eliot,
especially when his snooty provocations were becoming New Critical food
for textbooks.

But poetry is a conservative thing, fellas, profoundly so if I may use that
word, as well as a progressive thing; good poetry transcends these boundaries.
That was what I was trying to suggest; that Dewey has a set of paradigms
or criteria just as fixed as Eliot's, if not so blatantly insignia'd
with The Past.  Experiment is always a good spin on Contingency;
Open is a good spin-word for Inconclusive.

What if I don't accept the binary thing you set up with Pound / Davies?
What if I say, with Davies, that the poem is an end-in-itself, its
purpose is to play out its own teleology; but what if I say with Eliot
that the Universe is also a Work of Art, a Creation, and the perfected
work of art - by being perfect - becomes a part of that supernatural
Nature?  Ask Blake where that fits into the vatic/toy continuum.

Poetry is made by readers; the Poet is a Reader.  Poetry is an actual
Stream in which the reader begins to swim - with or against the currents.
By conservative I mean that the poet is essentially a
Listener who hears things down to their most ancient roots & relates
them to the present; who "brings things old & new out of the storehouse".

The reactionary/progressive boundaries of 100 years ago have shifted;
the hierarchies of the middle ages seen as a threat to democracy may
still have a stranglehold on institutions (viz. the Anglican Lambeth
Conference recently adjourned) but they are no longer of much intellectual
interest.  The concept of "experiment" in poetry is not only an open,
forward-looking, vatic opportunity; in academic circles it has a converse
face: aestheticism, just as remote from mundane realities as any of Davies'
propositions, to which any intellectual or philosophical challenge to
"nominalism" [Peirce's term for relativism] is seen as a threat.  Let me
quote from the founder of Dewey's pragmatism as he reflects on some of those
outmoded Dantean categories (from Peirce's essay "The Concept of God"):

"No concept, not even those of mathemativs, is absolutely precise; and some
of the most important for everyday use are extremely vague.  Nevertheless,
our instinctive beliefs involving such concepts are far more trustworthy
than the best established results of science, if these be precisely under-
stood.  For instance, we all think that there is an element of order in the
universe.  Could any laboratory experiments render that proposition more cert-
ain than instinct or common sense leaves it?  It is reidiculous to broach such
a question.  But when anybody undertakes to say _precisely_ what that order
consists in, he will quickly find he outruns all logical warrant.  Men who are
given to defining too much inevitably run themselves into confusion with the
vague concepts of common sense...

...Now such being the pragamticist's answer to the question what he means by
the word "God", the question whether there really is such a being is the
question whether all physical science is merely the figment - the arbitrary fig
ment - of the students of nature, and further whether the _one_ lesson of
Gautama Boodha, Confucius, Socrates, and all who from any point of view have
had their ways of conduct determined by meditation upon the physico-psychical
universe, be only their arbitrary notion or be the Truth behind the appear-
ances which the frivolous man does not think of; and whether the superhuman
courage which such contemplation has conferred upon priests who go to pass
their lives with lepers and refuse all offer of rescue is mere silly fanaticism
the passion of a baby, or whether it is strength derived from the power of
the truth.  Now the only guide to the answer to this question lies in the
power of the passion of love which more or less overmasters every agnostic
scientist and everybody who seriously and deeply considers the universe.
But whatever there may be of _argument_ in all this is as nothing, the
merest nothing, in comparison to its force as an appeal to one's own
instinct, which is to argument what substance is to shadow, what bed-rock is
to the built foundations of a cathedral...

...Where would such an idea, say as that of God, come from, if not from
direct experience?  Would you make it the result of some kind of reasoning,
good or bad?  Why, reasoning can supply the mind with nothing in the world
except an estimate of the value of a statistical ratio, that is, how often
certain kinds of things are found in certain combinations in the ordinary
courser of experience.  And scepticism, in the sense of doubt of the
validity of elementary ideas - which is really a proposal to turn an idea
out of court and permit no inquiry into its applicability - is doubly condemned
by the fundamental principle of scientific method - condemned first as
obstructing inquiry, and condemned second because it is treating some other
than a statistical ratio as a thing to be argued about.  No: as to God, open
your eyes - and your heart, which is also a perceptive organ - and you see him.
  But you may ask, Don't you admit there are any delusions?  Yes: I may think
a thing is black, and on close examination it may turn out to be bottle-
green.  But I cannot think a thing is black if there is no such thing to be
seen as black.  Neither can I think that a certain action is self-
sacrificing, if no such thing as self-sacrifice exists, although it may be
very rare.  It is the nominalists, and the nominalists alone, who indulge in
such scepticism, which the scientific method utterly condemns."

- Charles Peirce, founder of Pragmatism

Dear R M Daley,

I find this kind of post utterly useless and a painful waste of time. No
context, no substance. I've begun to automatically delete this kind of post
from the various lists that I listen to, when I figure out the sort of
people who like this sort of thing, and who are prone to it.

If you want me to read your posts, please give me a reason to. Otherwise,
deletion will be automatic.

MODERN VERSE

           Poetic injustice


           WHAT ever happened to poetry? Once poets spoke for the age
           and strutted the cultural stage as stars. What would
           European romanticism have been without Byron or Schiller?
           French symbolism without Rimbaud or Baudelaire?
           Anglo-American modernism without Eliot or Pound?



           It is easy now to forget just how ubiquitous poetry once
           was, and how central to the cultivated life. Schoolchildren
           were compelled to memorise long stanzas, until the rhythms
           of Tennyson or Longfellow were inscribed indelibly upon
           young minds. New poetry was reviewed as widely as novels,
           biographies and cookbooks are today. Now-forgotten poets
           such as America's John Greenleaf Whittier could become as
           famous, sometimes on the strength of a single poem, as
           actors, tycoons or politicians. Verse was humorous,
           populist, narrative, satirical or polemical; it was
           lyrical, personal or learnedly esoteric. Great occasions
           were marked by poems whose phrases sometimes entered the
           language, at least for a while. Walt Whitman's "When lilacs
           last in the door-yard bloom'd" mourned the death of Abraham
           Lincoln. Robert Frost's reading of "The Gift Outright"
           dignified the inauguration of John Kennedy.

           All that, however, was a long time ago. Today, contemporary
           poetry seems more akin to collecting butterflies,
           painting-by-numbers or gazing at stars: a nice pursuit for
           enthusiasts, but of little significance to anyone else. For
           many, the only poems that matter are advertising jingles,
           pop-music lyrics or rap music. Yet, to most people, song
           lyrics and rap remain one thing, poetry another. Whatever
           odd forms it may take, poetry is still usually assumed to
           consist of words to be spoken or read on their own,
           relished for their sound and meaning, not merely as an
           accompaniment to music, dancing or the latest pop video.

           Old-fashioned, just-the-words poetry continues to matter in
           places where artistic expression is repressed. This year,
           Index on Censorship, which chronicles the worldwide
           persecution of writers, devoted its 25th anniversary issue
           to poets. They can still end up in jail in Turkey, Iran,
           China and many African countries: the jackboot still fears
           the quill pen. But when repression has ended, interest in
           poetry often evaporates. Russia is the home of such
           poet-heroes as Mandelstam, Akhmatova, Pasternak and
           Brodsky; officially tolerated poets there once filled
           football stadiums and people once risked their freedom, and
           sometimes their lives, to read something new by a forbidden
           hand. Today Russia seems to have turned its back on
           contemporary poetry, now that made-for-television movies,
           hamburger joints and other temptations are available.

           In America and Britain, two countries with great poetic
           traditions and equally great poetic freedom, poetry has
           become more than culturally marginalised: it has fallen off
           the map. It is rarely reviewed in the pages of newspapers
           or popular magazines. Most big publishers, under pressure
           from their corporate bean-counters, dropped their poetry
           lists long ago.

           The money-man, however, is no more dangerous to verse than
           is the modernist, with his avant-garde ethos and
           public-be-damned attitude. Contemporary poetry is often
           obscure or self-referential, neither scans nor rhymes nor
           tells a story, is impossible to memorise, is often about
           the act of writing poetry itself, is humourless, and can be
           more like a puzzle than a poem. Small wonder that so many
           general readers, even those who lap up novels or buy
           theatre tickets or visit art galleries, have given up on
           contemporary poetry. When was the last time you bought a
           book of contemporary poetry? Can you remember even one poem
           by a living poet?

           More poems, less poetry

           Here arises a puzzle. Ironically, as poetry has become less
           significant as a cultural form, more of it has been
           produced. In America the explosive growth of
           creative-writing courses in colleges and universities has
           produced tens of thousands of "credentialed" poets. Most of
           them want to see their work in print, even if few people
           actually read it. Hundreds of small magazines and presses
           exist to oblige them, usually publishing their work in
           minute quantities.

           Len Fulton of Dustbooks, which publishes the Small Press
           Review, receives books from 300 new small presses and
           another 300 new magazines each month. Many little
           publishers do not survive long. But more than 1,400
           magazines and 800 small presses do last long enough to find
           their way into Mr Fulton's biannual "Directory of Poetry
           Publishers". "I've been doing this for years and I still
           find it amazing how much is published," he says. "Why do
           they do it?" The Internet, too, has produced a Niagara of
           self-publication by aspiring poets.

           This flood of versifying flows year in, year out: and it is
           almost completely unnoticed by the rest of the world. Some
           of the verse is good. But for a general reader wanting to
           sample it, the sheer volume is intimidating. To find
           something rewarding, the curious outsider has to plough
           through piles of dross, with little to guide him. Ask for
           advice, and an expert happily rattles off a list of names.
           Unfortunately, a second poetic expert will come up with an
           entirely different list. Third expert, third list. There
           are some fine poets writing today, but most people, with so
           many other claims on their time, can be forgiven for not
           finding them.

           People power

           So is poetry doomed forever to be like knitting, only less
           fun? Maybe not. Surprisingly, in the past few years it has
           begun to make something of a comeback. And the comeback has
           been led, not by more publications, but by more public
           readings.

           In the 1990s, poetry readings have become hip. Pioneered by
           places such as the Nuyorican Café in Manhattan, readings
           have spread to most large British and American cities, and
           are being staged not only in universities and schools but
           in libraries, bookshops, cafés and bars. Many are no longer
           the soporific, reverential affairs of the past, but lively,
           even boisterous, events. Some readings attract hundreds of
           people. One regular feature is an "open mike", an
           invitation to anyone to read or improvise.

           In America, poetry "slams" have become popular. Slam
           audiences, often of 200 or more, give each poem a "score"
           after it is read, until a final winner emerges in a
           "read-off". Perhaps the ultimate slam is a contest staged
           every June in Taos, New Mexico, to find the "Heavyweight
           Champion of Poetry". Quincy Troupe, the champion for two
           consecutive years (1994-95), describes an enthusiastic
           audience of "thousands" of people paying $15-20 to attend a
           week of readings which culminate in the "bout". The two
           contenders read a poem each for nine "rounds", which are
           scored for the audience by three judges. In the final
           round, the two poets have to improvise a poem from a word
           pulled out of a hat. The victor, cheered or jeered by the
           crowd, is awarded a trophy and heavyweight belt.

           For some people, such razzmatazz is a long way from what
           poetry is, or should be, about. Mr Troupe, however,
           disagrees. He is a two-time winner of the American Book
           Award and a professor of literature and creative writing at
           the University of California in San Diego, and he sees no
           inherent contradiction between showmanship and seriousness.
           "I write for the page," he says. "Any poet worth his salt
           does. But I think you can have mastery, you can have
           thought-provoking, difficult poems, and still be able to
           lift the poem off the page for an audience. And if you're
           going to read in front of people, you've got to give them a
           real performance."

           Is the vogue for public reading merely a fad, the final
           debasement of poetry as a pretentious sort of cabaret? Or
           is it the beginning of a genuine revival? The answer
           depends on what you think went wrong in the first place. It
           depends, that is, on whether poets are responsible for
           their own isolation, or whether poetry was doomed anyway to
           be shoved aside by television and films and popular music
           and web-surfing.

           "A little province for yourself"

           That question has long divided the poetry world. In 1991
           Dana Gioia, a poet (and former marketing manager for
           General Foods), set off a fierce debate in American poetry
           circles with an attack on American academia for turning
           poetry into a smug, producer-driven lobby, concerned only
           with its own survival and indifferent to the fact that it
           had alienated a wider audience. In an article entitled "Can
           Poetry Matter?", published in the Atlantic Monthly (and
           later elaborated in a book of the same title, published by
           the Graywolf Press), Mr Gioia lambasted the
           creative-writing establishment for loss of critical nerve,
           back-scratching and complacency.

           "The proliferation of literary journals and presses over
           the past 30 years has been a response less to an increased
           appetite for poetry among the public than to the desperate
           need of writing teachers for professional validation," he
           wrote. "Like subsidised farming that grows food no one
           wants, a poetry industry has been created to serve the
           interests of the producers and not the consumers. And in
           the process the integrity of the art has been betrayed."

           The wounds his words inflicted are still raw. When asked
           about Mr Gioia's argument, David Fenza--the director of
           Associated Writing Programs, which represents
           creative-writing teachers in academia--speaks of "smarmy
           little putzes that are blinded by their own presumptions."
           He flatly rejects Mr Gioia's criticisms.

           "They just don't make sense," Mr Fenza says. "The spread of
           writing programmes represents the democratisation of the
           arts. Creative writing is so attractive to students because
           it is one way of exercising the efficacy of the human will.
           There's an awful lot in our society that tells people that
           they don't have a free choice, that they can't make a
           difference. You can create a little province for yourself
           in a work of art, where your choices are paramount. That's
           a wonderful place to be."

           It must be, because 11,000 American students choose to work
           for degrees in creative writing every year, according to Mr
           Fenza, of whom about half "do poetry". The number of
           American universities offering creative-writing degrees has
           quadrupled in the past 20 years to 285. Mr Fenza blames a
           "stupefaction and dumbing-down of the media" for its
           indifference to poetry, and does not believe that the
           creative-writing industry itself bears any of the
           responsibility, or even that poetry has been marginalised.

           Mr Gioia remains unrepentant. Writing programmes are highly
           profitable for universities, he argues: hence their growth.
           They require no expensive laboratories, workshops or
           computers, just a room and a teacher. Students like
           creative writing because they cannot fail, since
           self-expression is difficult to mark. One result, Mr Gioia
           says, is a generation of professional poets with little
           experience of life outside full-time education. "The
           average academic poet has been in school since the age of
           six," he says. This hardly favours adventurousness or
           diversity.

           The reaction to his article and book, Mr Gioia says, showed
           that "there is a huge reservoir of interest in poetry out
           there, but most people feel cut off from what they see as
           official culture." He was deluged with letters. People from
           all walks of life, including housewives, ranchers, even a
           Hollywood producer and a UN ambassador, wrote to support
           his attack on the poetry subculture. Many, he says,
           complained that he had not gone far enough. "These people
           felt deprived of something important."

           Baudelaire on the Frigidaire

           For Mr Gioia, the sudden boom in public readings over the
           past few years has vindicated his view that the poetry
           establishment has been smothering a wider audience for
           poetry. "It happened completely outside the academy," he
           says. "The experts were taken by surprise." He is greatly
           encouraged by the popularity of rap ("the metre of Beowulf
           with African-American syncopation on top"), and by the
           recent rediscovery of such as "cowboy poetry", for which
           there are now 200 festivals a year (horses get in free). Mr
           Gioia himself is one of a group of "new formalist" poets
           returning to traditional poetic forms.

           There is other evidence that a wider public is interested
           in poetry, even if not in the fare offered by many
           contemporary poets. How else to explain the success of Dave
           Kapell, a former English major and sometime songwriter in
           Minneapolis? Four years ago he stumbled upon the idea of
           selling little boxes of word magnets that people can use to
           compose poems on the doors of their refrigerators. Since
           then, sales of his "Magnetic Poetry" kits have soared. He
           currently ships 50,000 kits a month and expects sales of
           the kits and related merchandise to reach $6.5m this year.

           "Many people start out by creating something pretty
           juvenile, often something obscene," admits Mr Kapell, "but
           most quickly start to take it more seriously." One who
           takes "magnetic poetry" seriously is Robert Pinsky,
           America's current poet laureate. He has written the preface
           to a new American anthology (from Workman Publishing) of
           ordinary people's "magnetic" poems, which he praises as
           true popular art, "the compositions of actual American
           people, produced not for profit but for the fun of it, to
           satisfy that peculiar, deep itch to make something new."
           (In fact, much of the collection proves that, although many
           people do have that peculiar, deep itch, they should
           probably scratch it in private.)

           The enthusiasm for posted poetry extends also to public
           transport. Poems on London's underground trains have
           enriched dreary commutes for a decade. A collection of
           these short poems, by contemporary poets as well as
           long-dead masters, has sold more than 250,000 copies
           (Cassell), and underground systems from Sydney to Stockholm
           have followed London's lead, as have buses in American
           cities. Britain's Poetry Society recently received a
           £450,000 grant from National Lottery funds to place poets
           (not just poems) in public parks, health centres,
           libraries, bookshops and zoos, as well as in schools. Poets
           are finding work in prisons, schools and companies, helping
           people to express their thoughts and feelings.

           More than a hanky

           As heartening as all this is for poets, who are usually
           grateful for any attention or gainful employment, a vogue
           for poetry as therapy is not quite the same as a revival of
           poetry as art. Composing poems on one's refrigerator door,
           or on the wall of one's prison cell, may bring comfort. But
           does it really spread a genuine interest in poetry, or is
           it just another gimmick for the emotionally constipated and
           the underworked? And does anyone but the author really want
           to read the poems produced?

           Viv Beeby, the producer of the BBC's "Poetry Please", a
           long-running radio programme which invites requests from
           listeners, reports that most listeners ask for old
           favourites learned in school, not for new poems. "People
           still seem to turn to poetry in times of crisis, when they
           can't find the words to express their feelings," she says.
           "I suspect that most of our listeners don't read poetry at
           other times." Verses on headstones and in Valentine's Day
           cards have always been popular. But surely poetry, if it is
           to matter as an art form, has to be something more than a
           verbal handkerchief for life's weepy moments?

           No doubt it is too much to expect that poets will ever
           again be cultural avatars, or that legions of readers will
           clamour for the next verse epic from some successor to
           Milton or Pope or Tennyson. And yet poetry need not,
           perhaps, have been pushed quite so far to the sidelines.
           Serious playwrights and novelists still find an audience,
           and they still occasionally make people sit up and listen.
           By comparison, too many poets seem to have lost the
           ability, or in many cases the desire, to reach readers
           outside their coterie, beyond their "little province of the
           self".

           The beauty of a surprising image; moments of revelation or
           contemplation; the pleasure of a well-turned or
           oft-remembered phrase: these are satisfactions that poetry,
           above all other arts, can offer. Society can afford to
           ignore contemporary poetry, and poets can complacently
           accept their isolation. But if that is how it is to be,
           something valuable will have been lost--valuable beyond
           words.

        << WHAT ever happened to poetry? Once poets spoke for the age
           and strutted the cultural stage as stars. What would

        Scanning this article, I thought of Myung Mi Kim interviewed in
Tripwire #1, finding a context for poetry, especially as she touches on a
theory of "generosity" (which I'm not prepared to try and paraphrase)
whereas the above article discusses the glut of small press publications.
Frankly, mention of Pound (whom it is always safe to assume your
contentious press-citizen has not read) alone contradicts what can only be
the unsafe assumptions put forth in the second sentence.  The way "poetry"
is being considered in this article, by this author, allows for it to only
be contextualized one way, negatively.  Why, then, does this article
matter?  Whatever the statistics, which are fraudulent at best, I imagine,
in any reasonable summation of a poetry's effectiveness in the
social/civic sphere, the poem is no longer a site of knowing but is
expected to be what none of the above cited authors ever truly were,
affirming.

from Henry's quote from Peirce:

"...Now such being the pragamticist's answer to the question what he means
by the word "God", the question whether there really is such a being is
the question whether all physical science is merely the figment - the
arbitrary fig ment - of the students of nature, and further whether the
_one_ lesson of Gautama Boodha, Confucius, Socrates, and all who from any
point of view have had their ways of conduct determined by meditation upon
the physico-psychical universe, be only their arbitrary notion or be the
Truth behind the appear-ances which the frivolous man does not think of;
and whether the superhuman courage which such contemplation has conferred
upon priests who go to pass their lives with lepers and refuse all offer
of rescue is mere silly fanaticism the passion of a baby, or whether it is
strength derived from the power of the truth."

Thanks for this Henry I think it opens up much, though it's also a
slippery slope, as Peirce must have recognized: he's relying on one of
James's arguments from The Varieties of Religious Experience, namely, that
God is "real" b/c, as a concept, he's been damn *useful* (why else bring
in the sacrifical priests and lepers for back-up?)  As James put it in
Pragmatism, "how could pragmatism possibly deny God's existence?  She
could see no meaning in treating as 'not true' a notion that was
pragmatically so successful."  Or, as he wrote once to Oliver Wendell
Holmes, "If God is dead or at least irrelevant, ditto everything
pertaining to the beyong" (this is, incidentally, *13 yrs* before
Nietzsche's famous pronouncement).  Now, you can see where this is headed:
James likes "God" but he's setting up a situation where the old boy has to
earn his keep.  Needless to say, any Christain w/ even remotely
fundamentalist leanings would throw a shit fit over this logic.  Now, back
to Peirce: he makes a somewhat different point, a kind of "18 million
people can't be wrong" point (this is the number of people who bought
Celine Dion's Titanic soundtrack, and so is quite obviously not true); but
he also leans toward James in describing the cultural work that the
concept does (the Priest's faith sends him to the leper).  I wouldn't
disagree entirely, but I'd want to bend the point somewhat - the key term
to me is "faith" not "God."  One always here's on television that people
who believe in God have longer life spans than people who don't: but, not
surprisingly, the media always leaves out a key, related finding, namely,
that atheists of conviction (people who really "believe" in atheism) live
just as long - it's us doubting, ambivalent suckers that die early, most
likely from the wear and tear of stress.  Now, again, what have we done to
poor old "God" if we say, yes, let's keep him around, he relieves stress
and increases our life span: one could say the same about a good jog in
the park.  And as for that priest, well, I wouldn't want to be in an
argument where I had to argue for the good done in the name of God against
someone arguing for the bad.

All I mean to suggest here is that once Pierce or James brings the
pragmatic method to a discussion of God, God is in trouble; you start to
see the writing on the wall.  At the same time, I think one needs
"God-terms" whose success are measured by how they operate in the culture,
what they do, how they motivate.  Dewey's God-term, in this sense, is
"democracy," as it is for Ralph Ellison, as it is, I would say, for Cornel
West.  This doesn't make "democracy" any more true than "God" - and I'd
agree w/ Jameson that democracy never in fact "exists," though I'd
disagree with the conclusions he draws from this fact about its efficacy
as a term.  As an active symbol, I think democracy still earns its keep
(though I like to add things to it eg, "plebeian democracy" "radical
democracy").  "God" I'm less sure about.

"In America and Britain, two countries with great poetic
 traditions and equally great poetic freedom, poetry has
 become more than culturally marginalised: it has fallen off
 the map. It is rarely reviewed in the pages of newspapers
 or popular magazines. Most big publishers, under pressure
 from their corporate bean-counters, dropped their poetry
 lists long ago."

Leftists historically have never been immune from racism. And racism can
certainly be subversive. But to this viewer Bullsworth wasn't even
superficially racist. In fact it was profoundly anti-racist!
Now Saving Private Ryan, that was racist!
By the way, according to Yevgeny Yevtushenko it was Warren Beatty who,
before the fall of the Soviet Union, smuggled the manuscript of YY's
Silver and Steel: 20th Century Russian Poetry, out of Russia and plunked
it down on somebody's desk at Doubleday. Pub. in 1993.
So it's only natural that when he needed a chorus he turned to Amiri
Baraka (sp?).
Perhaps Warren Beatty should be given an Honorary Membership in the
Poetics List, eh?

The infuriatingly dull-witted piece on the state of poetry collaged-in here
is from the end of 1997, The Economist's Xmas special. While it is bad, it
is old bad. There is an article in last week's Economist (the one with Old
Glory full of bulletholes) reviewing David Lehman's new history of the New
York School, _The Last Avant Garde_. Also discussed are Ashbery's new
collection, Amy Clampitt and Raymond Carver's collecteds, and Mark Doty's
new book.

Why do people keep saying John Ashbery's poetry is difficult and humorless?

the part in Peirce about the uselessness of argument in this sphere sounds
a lot like Whitman.  Both of them had Emersonian affinities; Peirce came
out of a Boston family with Transcendentalist connections.  But Nicolas
of Cusa (ca.1440) in _Of Learned Ignorance_ seems better to me than all of
them on these issues.

     To David McFadden:

     I would have thought it was obvious to anyone that the recent message
     posted by Laura Wright to the List regarding Todd Baron was a
     regrettable mistake, meant to be private, and mortifying to its
     sender. A MISTAKE. My post was meant to reflect my renewed belief in
     poetic justice and an exercising of my poetic License to Kill. Your
     reactions, with their gems from Bartlett's, are just silly. I would
     like to say that I am sloppy and stupid and that many of my ideals,
     ideas, and values are puppy-dog. I am often very lonely. Big deal. And
     as to your use of quotation, you're playing with fire. A panhandler
     walks up to a Wall Street financier and asks for a handout. Wall
     Street says, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be. William
     Shakespeare." The panhandler replies, "Fuck you! David Mamet."

I visited Bard to meet Scalapino in July and watched Watten give a
lecture/reading....He gave out free xeroxed copies of Poetics Journal and mine
was missing pages...I really enjoyed the piece done by Rod Smith using
lines from old CIA manuels that he had found in the Washington DC area.
My missing pages had Scalapino, Watten on HEttie Jones and Arkadii
Dragomoshenko.  Where can i order it, Small Press Distribution?

Anyone have an good feedback on the new Bernadette Mayer book
"Another Smashed Pinecone," we picked it up this weekend in ny and
it is great- good cover....

Oh yeah, this one writer, Travis Ortiz has a piece in the Poetics Journal that
is interesting, "from variously, not then" he also has a piece he sent to me
for "Tool a Magazine" which is equally interesting and we plan to put in
numero # 2.

NEWSLETTER OF THE DEEP SOUTH WRITERS CONFERENCE

                          Volume 4 Number 2
                              Summer 1998


ANNOUNCING THE THIRTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL
FALL DEEP SOUTH WRITERS CONFERENCE
SEPTEMBER 24-27, 1998

The English Department of the University of Southwestern
Louisiana is pleased to announce what is likely to be the
liveliest Deep South Writers Conference ever. It is loaded with
special events and features that will make it possible for
everyone attending-every writer, fan, and student of great
writing-to connect with our visiting writers and our own fine
writing community in ways that will be both entertaining and
profitable. Many of the events at this year's conference will
focus on an outdoor motif, emphasizing literary and artistic
approaches to nature. An extraordinary range of nature essayists,

poets, and photographers will be available to meet with
registrants for a weekend of workshops and readings. Here are
some of the things we've got planned:

•A screening of the gripping neo-noir film The Last Seduction,
followed by a discussion with its writer, Steve Barancik
•An exhibition of collaborative art-works by photographers and
poets
•Panels, lectures, and workshops on genre writing, nature
writing, journaling, the teaching of creative writing, and
interart collaboration
•A special folklore panel treating questions of Death and Dying
in literature (featuring an exhibition of poems and photographs
of Mexican roadside shrines organized by New Mexico artist Paige
DeShong)
•A return visit to Louisiana by William Pitt Root
•The debut of a special Nature edition of Many Mountains Moving
•A panel of editors who will discuss the question, Who wants what

I write?
•A Saturday Night "Poetry Crawl" (read on, read on . . . )

All this is in addition to our yearly readings by some of the
best writers in the country. This year's distinguished visitors
will include screenwriter Steve Barancik, Novelist Jodi Picoult,
nature writer David Gessner, mystery writer Brian Andrew Laird,
poet William Pitt Root, and poet and journal writer Pamela
Uschuk. And as always, this year's conference will benefit from
the participation of USL's creative writing faculty, including
Joe Andriano, Darrell Bourque, Herb Fackler, Skip Fox, George
Clark, Mark Lewandowski, Jerry McGuire, Burton Raffel, Denise
Rogers, David Thibodaux, and Luis Alberto Urrea. USL folklorists
Barry Ancelet and Marcia Gaudet will also participate in the
conference, as will USL graduate students. Finally, we are
especially delighted to announce that USL's celebrated writer-in
residence, Ernest Gaines, will give a featured reading.

Our Featured Writers

Jodi Picoult is a critically-acclaimed author of five novels,
including this year's The Pact, a novel about teen suicide and
how it affects the family. Her work focuses on themes of love,
family, marriage, and motherhood while examining current issues
such as suicide, euthanasia, and unexpected pregnancy. Her books
include Harvesting the Heart, Mercy, Picture Perfect, and Songs
of the Humpback Whale. She lives in New Hampshire with her
husband and three small children, and jokes she is well-versed in

the juggling act of "writing while passing out sippy cups." She
will offer a fiction workshop on Friday and a craft lecture and
reading on Saturday, in addition to other conference activities
open to registrants.

William Pitt Root is one of the premier poets in the United
States. His work originates from the Beat milieu, but his
nature-based poetry reflects affiliations with some of our great
environmental poets, such as Gary Snyder and William Stafford.
Faultdancing, Root's latest collection of poems, was selected for

the recent Pitt Poetry Prize. He is the author of nearly a dozen
other books of poetry. Dividing his time equally between New York

City and Tucson, Arizona, he is a professor at Hunter College,
while serving as official Poet Laureate of Tucson.

Brian Andrew Laird, a life-long native of the Sonoran Desert
region, is a mystery writer, naturalist, editor, and short-story
author. He is a fast rising member of the emerging "new mystery"
community, and translates his expertise in the natural world to
his novels and short stories. Laird's books include Bowman's
Line, To Bury the Dead, and the forthcoming Best Shot. He is
currently editing the special Nature issue of the literary
journal Many Mountains Moving. Laird also serves as a freelance
editor for the University of Arizona Press and teaches writing
workshops and English classes both at the University of Arizona
and Pima Community College. Laird will offer a craft
lecture/workshop in mystery writing and a reading on Friday, and
will participate in panels on Saturday and Sunday.

Pamela Uschuk will be offering a special workshop in journal
writing and its role in the writer's life. A poet and fiction
writer, she is currently co-writing a journaling book with poet
Joy Harjo. Uschuk also teaches creative writing workshops and
English classes in a wide variety of venues-at the university
level, in community centers, and on Native American reservations
in the west. Her numerous publications have garnered her several
awards, including the Chester H. Jones Award in 1989. The wife of

William Pitt Root, her own books of poetry include Without Birds,

Without Flowers, Without Trees.

David Gessner, author of A Wild, Rank Place: One Year on Cape
Cod, lives on Cape Cod with his wife, writer Marina de Gramont.
His work, which combines nature writing and memoir, has been
published in such distinguished publications as Creative
Nonfiction, The Boston Globe, Literal Latté, Exquisite Corpse,
and Puerto del Sol. One of his essays, "Going Outward," was
winner of the 1997 Associated Writing Programs Intro Journals
Award. The University of Arizona Press will publish his most
recent book, Under the Devil's Thumb, in June 1999. At Deep South

he will read from his work, and give a craft lecture on nature
writing, and join with Pamela Uschuck in a workshop on nature
writing.

Special Feature: Film Noir and Screen Writing

This year's conference will open on Thursday night, September
24th, with a special on-campus screening of acclaimed
Tucson-based screenwriter Steve Barancik's 1994 film The Last
Seduction, a wild and ruthless thriller that expertly captures
the cold, darkly paranoid heart of the film noir genre. Barancik
conducts frequent workshops on the art of screen writing and has
made numerous appearances at film festivals nation-wide to
discuss the craft, mood, and texture of film noir. Screenwriting
hopefuls are strongly encouraged to attend Thursday night's
screening of The Last Seduction, after which Barancik will host a

discussion of the film. On Saturday, Barancik will give a craft
lecture/workshop and take part in a panel on the genre voice,
open to conference registrants.

Panels

Once again this year, the Deep South Writers Conference will
present panels designed to allow conference participants to
express their concerns and interests as writers and scholars.
While all details have not been concluded as of this date, we
expect presentations on creative writing pedagogy, on interart
collaboration, and on writing and publishing genre fiction.

Special Feature: Panel of Editors

In addition, we have invited a diverse gathering of literary
editors from every level of the professional publishing
experience for an open and frank discussion of the sorts of
writing editors seek today. As the publishing world continues in
its present state of turmoil, a few hours spent in the company of

such editors will prove invaluable for the aspiring writer. The
roster will include:

Literary Journal: Naomi Horii and Luis Urrea (Many Mountains
Moving), Jack Bedell (Louisiana Literature)
Literary/Scholarly: Jerry McGuire (Terra Poetica, Audit, College
Literature)
Freelance/Small Press: Brian Andrew Laird
Daily Newspaper: Curtis Coughlan (The Daily Advertiser)
University Press: Judith Allen of University of Arizona Press

Intensive Writing Workshops

Most published authors agree that critical discussion of
works-in-progress is an essential component of the writing
process. The Conference offers intensive writing workshops for
conference participants, encouraging reader response and fresh
criticism on manuscripts in progress. Workshop registrants will
critique their own work as well as the work of their peers under
the guidance of an experienced writer. Manuscripts are examined
in preparation for publication, and serious writers of all levels

are encouraged to enroll. Participants receive copies of all
manuscripts written by fellow workshop participants in advance
with instructions on how to review and respond to them. Intensive

writing workshops will be conducted by visiting writers in poetry

and short fiction, and by USL writer Martha Hixon in children's
fiction. In addition, the Council for the Development of French
in Louisiana will sponsor a workshop for poetry and fiction in
French. Enrollment in the workshops is limited to ten
participants per workshop on a first-come basis, and involves a
supplementary fee of $40 for each workshop. If the demand for
workshops exceeds expectations, additional workshops will be
scheduled. Writers wishing to enroll in one or more of these
workshops should send their manuscripts to:

Dr. Jerry McGuire
Deep South Writers Conference
English Department, Box 44691
Lafayette, LA 70504-4691.

For poetry manuscripts, please submit 3 poems, typed. For prose
manuscripts, submit up to 15 pages typed, double-spaced.

Do the Poetry Crawl

In keeping with our outdoor emphasis, writers and artists are
encouraged to come with nature and the environment in mind. As
before, the graduate students in the Creative Writing
Concentration will host an open-microphone reading for all
conference participants who would like to read from their work.
This year's open reading will feature its own outdoor dimension,
however, as members are encouraged to join in a moveable feast of

readings in selected venues in the Lafayette community. After
Saturday night's reading Jodi Picoult and Ernest Gaines, we'll
gather up our forces and move from place to place (at each of
these good food and/or drink will be available for the hungry,
thirsty gang), giving open readings as we go. Come learn a little

more about Lafayette's literary scene, and be part of the most
literate floating opera in the state!

The Deep South Writers Conference Contest Results

As in years past, the winners of the various categories of the
Deep South Writers Conference Contests will be honored at a
special ceremony preceding Friday night's reading by Brian Andrew

Laird and William Pitt Root. The winning authors in the
categories of Short Fiction, Young Adult Fiction, Children's
Fiction, Novel, French Poetry, and French Prose will be
announced, as will the winners of the Ethel Harvey Award
(Nonfiction), the John Z. Bennett Award (Poetry), the Paul T.
Nolan Award (One-Act Play), and the James H. Wilson Award
(Full-Length Play). Winners, contenders, and future hopefuls are
encouraged to attend the ceremonies. After the reading, we'll
convene at David Thibodaux's house for refreshments, where the
editors (and many of the writers) of the special Nature issue of
Many Mountains will unveil their work.

Conference Registration: How to Be a Part of the Weekend

There is a $40.00 registration for the conference which rises to
$50.00 after September 11th. The Deep South Writers Conference is

one of the most affordable writing conferences in the United
States, due in large part to the support received from sponsors,
without whom a gathering of talent like this would not be
possible. The program is supported by a grant from the Louisiana
Division of the Arts, by a Partnership Award from the Acadiana
Arts Council, and by the Department of English and the College of

Fine Arts at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. But the
greatest measure of The Conference's success continues to be the
enrollment of writers who wish to contribute to and benefit from
such a gathering. Registration (see page 3 for schedule and
registration form) includes lectures, panel discussions, and
special events. For more information, interested writers and
artists may contact Jerry McGuire at 318-482-5478, or by email at

jlm@usl.edu, or write to:

Subject:      Rudeness on the List
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Then God says to the financier, "Go to more off-Broadway shows." Then God
says to the panhandler, "Get a job!"

If Peter Balestrieri is annoyed with David McFadden for gently reprimanding
Laura Wright's mistake, what shall we think of Peter Balestrieri for
rudely reprimanding David McFadden's mistake?

I shall prefer the gentle correction to the rude one. There is so much of
self-glorification in Peter Balestrieri's rudeness; that's what makes it
hard to take. So he has a Poetic License to Kill, huh?  Kinda makes a fella
want to not wait for The Law.

In shooting David McFadden from the hip, Peter Balestrieri overlooked the
possibility that David McFadden did _not_ recognize Laura Wright had made a
mistake; if someone hasn't been on the List long, he might well not
understand how her private dissection of Todd Baron had appeared before us
all.

Are the Rude Planets in conjunction? For we also have the spectacle of
R.Daley chewing up the carpet over George Thompson's correction. I have
only been on the List a year and a half, but I have seen several previous
outbursts of rudeness--sometimes completely unprovoked, as far as one could
tell, and I have seen a number of postings that suggest some kind of
List-civility is looked for. In this respect, I don't see why the List
should be any different than social intercourse in general. It's more
interesting if it has some Mind in it.

Peter Balestrieri doesn't think that David McFadden should make anything
out of Laura Wright's unfortunate posting, because it was a mistake. But
when Peter Balestrieri posted that Todd Baron's pigeons had come home to
roost, he himself was piggy-backing on Laura Wright's mistake. I'm sure
this saying can also be found in Bartlett's Quotations : "The pot should
not call the kettle black."

Okay. An answer, and that's it.

Not offensive. Just a waste of time.

Maybe I am older than you are.

I see before me just a dwindling fucking bit of daylight. Just a little.

If that is what you saw before you, would you waste your time reading your
posts to this list?

I mean, why poetics?

And David Bromige is I bet older than I am.

The bottom line in all of these ludicrous posts is the mistake of replying
to the List instead of backchannel. A simple solution to all of these
time-wasters:

1. Double-check in your replies that they are traveling to the correct
destination.

2. If you intend to reply to an individual about a List-related matter,
think very hard before you reply to the entire List.  Think about if you
were in a room with every List subscriber packed close enough to hear every
word of your conversation. Is it interesting and useful public information?

All of the messages around the Todd Baron snafu should have gone
backchannel to avoid embrassment and frustration for those of us who
subscribe for information about the Poetry community.

We've been through this before. Ugh.

speaking as one "todd baron"--I find all of the assumptions, amusements,

hmm but writing on this list  IS VERY DIFFERENT from speaking to each
other in a room over cocktails and black tights and seems unique in this,
like a license to pass notes in class and perhaps not MIND in front of all
the teachers , and by the way the teachers are invited, and giving a push
and a shove now and then and personally and publicly in LIGHT very fading
light or bright shiny floods rant in ways possible, as this is something
presumably perhaps one thing in common on this group chat is all a raving
interest in writing and reading and trying it out and putting it on - all
diferent kinda ons I HOPE would be at least allowed, if comparisons serve,
I have never been to a reading where someone voicing the least bit of
dissonance or interest in playing with space in a breath or
time on a page has been told they were wasting everyone's time--ie, isnt
this just all protest against wasting it?!?is
this possible??and if your time is being WASTED whose fault is that? chan

By hitting hard in the face people who have hit you you may either deter
future assaults or provoke them. The Booger of State spoke yesterday in the
name of Decent People, like the revered Emperor Reagan of yesteryear, who
once said "If we can find them, we will kill them." He did not find Them but
instead had the children of the Hated Leader killed. This, 1986, in Libya,
but Moral Superiority does not stop in Northern Africa only. No campground
is too far. Why do terrorists attack Americans? A: because we are so good;
it incites jealousy and resentment. That American soldiers have been killed
in Beirut, Riyadh; why, people do not ask, are American military bases
there? Nor has it come up that in the wake of the =91strafing=92 of=

Sun & Moon Press is proud to announce
the publication of NOD by Fanny Howe.

In NOD, her ninth book of fiction, major American
novelist and poet Fanny Howe explores sibling
rivalry within a family that, in the advent of
World War II, is both disintegrating and stumbling
into the terrible, dark adulthood of the later half
of the Twentieth Century.
   Yet for all the dark forces at work in Howe's novel,
she presents also a world of wonder, of sexual awakenings
interlinked with the Irish countryside and culture
in which the girls grow up, the strange stories and
myths they heaar from the Norwegian north and retell
through their own highly-wrought imaginations. The central
figures of this fiction, Irene and Cloda, interact with
one another and the man who has encamped in their ghost-,
now guest-room, asif playing out the lives of the Brontes
to a packed theater audience.

Is/has anyone on list reading/read this the latest from Ed Dorn, recently
available from etruscan books? (SPD too).  I've not been on list that long and
may have been spoken too.  That said I find his 'sample' from LANGUEDOC
VARIORUM (A defense of hersey and heretics), as usual from Dorn, timely to not
only this list but the global nonsense taking place these days.

By way of introduction, and first impressions, after being happily logged
on for a mere week, the Poetics List is everything it seemed to be when a
certain old member first told me about it a year or two ago and urged me
to join. Having been involved in daily poetic practice for forty years I'm
currently involved in tearing down various weatherbeaten theoretic
structures and can;t resist the temptation to turn my head occasionally in
search of new ones to take their place.
What I wasn't prepared for was this spate of vindictiveness, this viaduct
of spite, this river of resentment, a sort of Internet Road Rage. But even
that has its own parochial fascination, like cowboy movies from the
forties, and is part of the charm.
Predictably, some have been inspired to complain even about my innocent
little sig. files, but these people I understand completely, and I
appreciate their perceptively caustic wit, especially when it's directed
at le grand moi-meme. One can't waste one's precious time in trying not to
be annoying, when it is one's nature pure and simple to be annoying, at
least to people in a certain mental state. So, I am what I am, and if you
find my posts (and my sig. files) excessively irritating please consider
taking up a petition to have me evicted toot sweet.

after a long, arduous, journey through the American Southwest, including two
nights with William R. Howe and his mother in Lubbock Texas, me, bubby and moby
have all landed safely here in this beach town (read desert). First thing Moby
did was to kill a pretty good size lizard; holding it down with one paw, she
ruthlessly hammered it with the other--claws full ablaze.  My what pests you
have here!

anyhow- I'm slowly getting settled here. note new email address:
kuszai@earthlink.net

because I have not finished my degree and will remain registered at SUNY
Buffalo until then, my email there will remain valid and for reasons of
convenience the meow press site will also stay there for now.

a couple of notes.

1.
I am working on a response to Steve Dickison's lecture at Naropa--and wonder if
there is interest in a series of dialogs on the small press poetry world.
mostly my concern is with the economics, ethics, and the engineering of small
press poetry production. I hope to produce at least one or as many as a a few
chapbooks about this issue. My interest is various, from ideas about the
relation of book production to the larger economic systems we participate in
(abbreviated form) to very nuts and bolts HOW TO make a chapbook with a ten
year old computer, a laser printer, and an oz. of desire to make it happen. Of
course metaphysical ramblings about the meaning/value of chapbooks as a "form"
or whatnot are also interesting. This is all in formation and I'd appreciate
feedback, whether here or privately.

2.
I have been reading the digests with great concern. You may have thought that
my transport to California would mean that there were no polzei minding the
store. Well I can assure you that I have my jack-boots on and I'm as quick as
CHPs to give out Poetics Points for various infractions. The lastest is of
course David Bromige, who once again reminds us of his legal training and
expertise in motivational rhetoric. He also reminds me that I have kin in
Sonoma County.

Here is an exerpt from the Welcome Message, for those who need a remind:

"Please keep in mind that all posts go out immediately to all subscribers,
and become part of an on-line archive. *Posting to Poetics is a form of
publication, not personal communication.* Participants are asked to
exercise caution before posting messages! While spontaneity of response may
seem the very heart of the list at its best, it also has the darker side of
circulating ideas that have not been well considered (or considered by
another reader -- editor or friend). Given the nature of the medium,
subscribers do well to maintain some skepticism when reading the list and,
where possible, to try to avoid taking what may be something close to a
spontaneous comment made in the heat of exchange as if it were a revised or
edited essay ("Let the Reader Beware!")."

and handmade bookworks; as against being constrained
to such by economics/politics?  how are the choices made
by soviet era samizdat publishers (editions of 12 'cause
that's the maximum number of carbons you can squeeze in
th typewriter) comparable to those of us who publish work
w/ constrained (by forces? by choice?) or limited audiences...

Ok, I'll just jump on where the movies start.  BULLWORTH.  Star vehicle #
800010 approximately.  Haven't actually seen it but have a story: a friend
of mine was invited to an advance screening as a "[movie] executive of
color" , realizing this once there and looking about the room, and being
bombasted with questions from Warren Beatty about how it struck, did it
offend, blabla, and then told coyly by Annette Benning (Mrs Warren Beatty)
"Wow, he really put you on the spot!".  PUH-LEASE.  Of course this is not a
surprising hollywood story, but I am simply not willing to consider Warren,
a playboy freak who can't act and is too old for me to even remember as
mildly attractive, as some kind of vanguard figure, laying open new realms
for us losers.  This is crap, my dear Kent, I come down on that side of your
question.  To me there is something racist in the power dynamic of Mr.
Beatty asking a young exec of color an opinion, when obviously he holds the
power and is, I doubt, listening -- or if so, merely for his own gain.

Lover of Hollywood,

ps if you want poets in movies, why not fake ones like Henry Fool, where we

      Well of course he can't be doing anything new or important if he's
old and unattractive. but it's just a little presumptuous, don't you think,
to *know* that he wasn't *really*.interested in the man's opinion, and

Bullworth had a pretty obvious anti-racist thrust to it, but there were
some very troubling things about how all that was handled/represented. It
was damn sexist for one thing and the whole gangsta ethos is very dated as
parts of the soundtrack attest, i.e. Cypress Hill circa early 90's. What
was that doing in there? I guess it was chronologically correct. Was there
an explicit period to this. I can't remember.

Anyway, I thought the film was laden with black stereotypes ever so
slightly modified, Kale not Collard Greens.

I'd like to know what Amiri Baraka thinks of the finished product. I can
see anybody being hyped by the script, but the goofy way that the scenes
erupt detracted from the message. Baraka's role seems like window dressing,
something thrown in but not developed. "The spirit is not a ghost" I love
that, but it didn't fit with the rest at all. But I like Daniel's take that
he functions as a cipher cutting through the spectacle.

But why did the dressing down of an automaton politician have to be the
result of sleep deprivation: temporary, easily rectified and explained? And
why does the movie walk right back into the warm embrace with the media
that it so cannily eluded throughout?

Why does Jordan  keep wondering why people keep saying John Ashbery's
poetry is difficult and humorless? Perhaps they thought A Wave was
goodbye rather than hello.  Especially when more pressing issues such as
Bill Clinton's under the table payee arrangement to promote Wag the Dog,
Todd Baron's dogish issue, and the new _Economist_ article's statement
about Mark Doty being "the finest American poet since Robert Lowell" are
full fathom five. The public is a shallow act.

I have had it in mind for some time to do something similar on web sites
as "small press publictions" - perhaps I need to do and not say.  I
would be interested in seeing opinions/discussion on the issue of
whether web publications qualify as small press.  What I have seen has
been basically affirmative but of course for the most comes from those
who have published or put a site on the web.

Dear List,

After reading the several posts on Bullworth I thought I'd kick in with my
take on it.

Yes, the politics of race (and gender) in it are often confused and
obsfucatory (some in ways that can't be resuscitated).........

And it's a silly premise, some official going bonkers and rapping and all
that...

BUT (and here I share Kent Johnston's enthusiasm for it)

It gets its licks in...something that doesn't happen often...to a wide
audience...and it pins Corporate America to the wall in the way that maybe
some on the list surely are able...but your average "american", having been
droned by so many distortions over the years, so many alibi's etc...needs to
piece it together better...Bullworth hammers away at corporate domination of
the media for example, and reintroduces the question of socialized medicine in
an, albeit, comical way....something's that's ongoing in many quarters of a
broad struggle, and something that, I think Bullworth adds
to............................................

The audience I saw it with cheered (out loud) at some of the things Beatty
uttered...(incidently, I saw Beatty getting grilled by Cokie Roberts and Sam
Donaldson over the movie...and he held up pretty good, "rope a' doped"
them...in other words, some elements in the Ruling Class "got it"...)

Michael Moore's The Big One is also an important movie, or rather documentary
that lays bare some basic shifts in thinking that has to happen in order to
not just abandon the twin parties of capital...but start looking in earnest to
efforts that might have a better chance at represent working people's
interests....

(If I weren't genuinely interested in that last, I could get real "smart" on
the movie too... drag it to my plate, pick at it with a pedantic or aesthete's
fork...raise my nose and push it away...)

-------------

The foundation of SAWSJ (scholars, artists and writers for social justice,
which Kent, to his credit, posts updates to on this list), the upcoming First
Constitutional Convention of the Labor Party (two years after its Founding
Convention), the recent Black Radical Congress (BRC), these and so many other
cultural-political occasions signal a real response to the (seemingly
uncontested) rule of Capital....

---------------


Dynamic Contextualization, not more static, empiricist, undialectical
"sophistication"...

*** A brand new flava in ya mouth

The company that gave the world Tamagotchi virtual pets is promoting
what it hopes will be the next hot toy: a battery-operated lollipop
holder that plays music inside people's mouths. The microphone-sized
toy called Silent Shout plays a tune by vibrating a lollipop stuck
into the device, Bandai Co. spokesman Masashi Umeda said Thursday.
The instrumental songs include a hip-hop rhythm. "One of the merits
is that the sound won't annoy others," he said. The toy works by
conducting sounds through the teeth. The sounds then echo into the
inner ear. It will go on sale in Japan next month for about $10. (AP)

        Has anyone any info on the reported craze for nude poetry readings
that is sweeping Europe? My informant is an acquaintance at the health club
where I work out. He told me it had begun in Vienna, and subsequently had
fanned out across Europe.  I immediately raised the weight I was pumping by
10 pounds. Mentally I echoed Giancarlo from _7 Beauties_ (is it?), "oh no,
my ass has fallen!"

heard a report on th npr/bbc radio show "the world" yesterday;
sounded more like an event (staged reading, 2 shows, in london)
than a movement...  over the radio, the poetry seemed to have
little to say...

I agree with Kent Johnson and Rodrigo Toscano on this one.  Bulworth needs
to be viewed in the context of what people usually see at our theaters--
Harrison Ford as Prez personally "taking out" terrorists, for instance.
In light of the usual crap and for its alomst "brechtian" engagement of
theatrical modes and auduence address, I thought it was way beyond my
usual movie experience.

Dear Folks,

I've been asked to teach a graduate course on American Comedy, and I was
wondering if people on the list had suggestions for material.  I've taught
similar courses and have reached back to Franklin, Royall Tyler, Twain (of
course), Chaplin, John Leguizamo's Mambo Mouth, and others.  I'll do the
same -- but I'm looking for additional suggestions.  I have a take: that
as the 20th century progresses, comedy in literature and performance
becomes an increasingly major mode, more respected than when Twain was
"merely" a humorist (as oppossed to being a traitor, which he preferred,
during the Philippine war), and that, paired with the horrific,
particularly in "black" comedy and satire, has become a characteristically
modern (or post-modern, if you prefer) sensibility.  So, I would want
students to read Kenneth Koch, Frank O'Hara, Ginsberg, and others.  Any
other suggestions from the entire stretch of 19th and 20th century poets,
novelists, essayists, performers?  Also, there is very little theoretical
discussion on the nature of laughter and comedy -- and (perhaps
fortunately) no single dominant theory (superiority, relief, incongruity
are the three major categories, and there issome recent research on the
biological effects of laughter). There are, of course, Bakhtin's
wonderful insights, but do people know of others?  I would appreciate any
suggestions and discussions of this.  It's at least worth a laugh.

Thanks,

You might also look at the work of Eric Bogosian
(http://www.users.interport.net/~ararat/index.html)
and Spalding Gray. Both monologists, both humorous/poetic, though Bogosian much
darker, humor-wise.
BTW, Bogosian starred in a wonderful movie "Talk Radio," based on murdered
radio host Alan Berg (sp?)
--directed by Oliver Stone.

I think it's important to get hold of Artemus Ward, whose London presen-
tations/performances were published, complete with voice inflections, etc.
He's like an intense W.C. Fields from the 1800s and a precursor of a lot
- including performance art and narrative film.

Correction: _The Rationale of the Dirty Joke_.
Freud wrote a few essays on humor and jokes--someone out there should be
able to reference these better than I have.
It's an endless category, of course. Don't forget Gunslinger.

You shouldn't neglect comix from 1960's on, especially in re: concrete,
vispo, and visual poetic humor?

I think that you are onto it now. But the drift is not only USAmerican. I
think that almost all major fiction, for instance, of the recent past has
been comedic.

There is Beckett at the top end, if you like, and Kurt Vonnegut down here.
But look at the comic writers. Ishmael Reed. Jerome Charyn. Italo Calvino.
John Hawkes (sometimes), Gerald Vizenor. Philip Roth. Don DeLillo. Mordecai
Richler. Harry Mathews. Flan O'Brien. Donald Barthelme. Douglas Woolf. I
dont find a lot of women on this list, do I? I think that the women writers
I read are more likely to be into irony, like Atwood, like Modernists.

this was basically Baraka's point when he read here at Vertigo Books about two weeks

ago.

Someone asked where the phrase "ivory tower" comes from. According to the
excellent Random House Websters Unabridged Electronic Dictionary:=20
i=C6vory tow=C6er, =20
1.      a place or situation remote from worldly or practical affairs: the
university as an ivory tower.=20
2.      an attitude of aloofness from or disdain or disregard for worldly or
practical affairs: his ivory tower of complacency.=20
[trans. of F tour d'ivoire, phrase used by C.A. Sainte-Beuve in reference
to the
isolated life of the poet A. de Vigny (1837)]

A mob of dimwitted teens has been camped outside the Sutton Place for 48
hours in the rain, waiting for some Spice Girl to emerge. I walked by and
said "Hey, horrible news, eh?" They said, "What happened?" I said, "John
Lennon of the Beatles? Some madman has shot and killed him!" They looked
horribly stricken. They said, "Oh no, who did it? Why'd they do it? Did
they get the guy? When did it happen?"

Are you including any novels by Dawn Powell?  She's a mid-century satirist
of cultural life in New York, where she lived, and provincial life in Ohio,
where she was from.  She's something of a subtler, more prolific Dorothy
Parker, though this description does not do her justice.  Her work is
enjoying a long overdue revival just now.

Ever notice how the accusation of "humorlessness" is hurled to discredit
a) feminism b) the left c) anything the accuser doesn't like? I've even
heard it in respect to Language poetry, in which I find much humor. If
comedy is perspectival, a lot of this depends on one's perspective,
obviously. I don't find most "humorists" very amusing for example...

Risible or not, we all do it, in full recognition that what is produced is
necessarily at least as much an artifact of the receiving culture and poet
as of the culture and poet of origin, despite one's best intentions.

But you've raised the ante, I think. Junction Press, of which I am the
publisher, has released one translation (The Duration of the Voyage, by
Argentine poet Luisa Futoransky) and is soon to release another (Stet, by
Cuban poet Jose Kozer). In each case the work, widely recognized by readers
of the language of origin, has been virtually unknown in the
English-speaking world. But, if I read you aright, these don't count, as
Spanish is a European language. And I certainly would agree with you that
African and Asian languages are far less well represented in English
translation. Not hard to understand in non-theoretical, non-litwar
terms--few of our poets know these languages well enough to give it a shot.

But let me throw in a piece of self-justification. My program is precisely
to publish translations of work in the _other_ American languages. To most
of my compatriots the world south of the border scarcely exists except for
a few resorts. Even among poets there is little access to contemporary
poetry of our nearest unknown neighbors. Job one seems to me to remedy that
situation. I should think that British translators would be most interested
in uncovering work in the other languages of their own intimate strangers,
the peoples they used to govern, large numbers of whom now live among them.

i think this was in the new criterion:


That old rascal John Ashbery has long passed the grand climacteric (he

turns seventy-one this year), and perhaps it's too late to expect the dog

to learn new tricks. His softly inflated, discount surrealism looks as easy

as ever. Like many poets who settle into the comfort of a style, he's

inimitable -- if you imitated him you'd not just sound like Ashbery, you'd

BE Ashbery. I don't know why poets don't open Renaissance workshops and

have apprentice poets knock off poems in the master's style, but perhaps

that's what writing workshops do already.



Wakefulness is like a lot of recent Ashbery (has anyone noticed there's an

awful lot of recent Ashbery -- over 700 pages this decade?), seamless in

its disjunctions, playful in its nonsense or pretend sense, irritatingly

elusive, woolly and woolgathering. He's like a music-hall comedian who

doesn't bother to vary his delivery one year to the next: you hear the

catchphrases and you laugh, not because he's funny, but because he's not

funny. His comedy has a tragic edge, though he's now less like Keaton than

Beckett -- with a lot more words.



Ashbery's most delicious lines are about language or literature:



        We thought we had seen a few new

adjectives, but nobody was too sure. They

might have been

gerunds, or bunches of breakfast. . .



The poem drifting off here is titled "Last Night I dreamed I Was in

Bucharest," and the movement toward waking and hunger is something Freud

would have understood. It has the dreamy logic that makes so much of

Ashbery's poetry a storehouse of half-forgotten phrases, giddy echoes of

other poems: Whitman, say ("Once, on Manhatta's bleak shore,/ I trolled for

spunkfish"), or Yeats ("Things break. Yes, they fail/ or they are anchored

up ahead"). One poem is composed entirely of quotations.



Ashbery's poems revel in their detachments, their refusal of narrative,

their refusal of most of the traditional supports of poetry. He proves how

little poetry depends on creating meaning -- the urge to make meaning is so

strong, the reader will supply what the words cannot. Ashbery's poems

indefinitely postpone the promise of sense; but, even as they promise, the

poems erase their own existence, falling forward rather than leaning back

(poetry is one of the arts that usually depend on acknowledging the past)

-- you can't remember at the end of a poem how or why it started. The poem

itself doesn't remember. Ashbery's poems have the equivalent of Alzheimer's

disease.



Ashbery isn't often so dreadful (there are few lines like "all over the

paisley fields dominoes are braying" or "A diagonal lipstick/ chased him

across the street"), but when he's bad he's as rotten as poetry gets. The

destitution of his phrases is also his strength. His work reminds us how

much of contemporary poetry survives on its little narratives, its clumsy

emotional urgency: the impertinence of his poems acts most tellingly not in

books but one by one in magazines, where they mock little gray-flannel

poems (well, poems of any cloth). Ashbery's work looks better the more you

forget it (the more you suffer from Alzheimer's, perhaps), and he has

become a poet of severe importance for what his verse denies rather than

what it accepts. There's scarcely a poem worth reading again; but few poets

have so severely manipulated, or just plain tortured, our soiled desire for

meaning. He reminds us that most poets who give us meaning don't know what

they're talking about.

loved that 'continuity person' concept in sondheims poem and wrote this:

                the change that binds


the body of continuity, one of every 1000 bodies
caroming on invisible tracks
bounding off the potential bodies we carry around us
like psychic spheres, cones of silence, half-inflated inner tubes
wrapped around the bumper cars
draining from our credit cards like a burnt out washedr
somewhere inside the heart
where so many jokes were stopped to consider, frisked at the border,
so many half expressions
misinterpreted as meanings
ripple i couldnt feel
walking 2 feet into the pavement,
not deep enough to live again,
eating from the inside, like the earth does,
eating with a inward focussed vortex, each step a chord
on the damaged/ mistreated/ neglected,/surprisingly well-preserved
piano of my body
rolling through this similarly mysterious cityscape

this hour has never existed, doesnt have a corresponding number
to dial
        the beeping in my chest
says do something right now, do what you forgot, why keep walking straight
with so many fractal corners, corners the edges have worn off of,
occasional bites when just trying to get grounded,    to get a taste that
settles me in

to look back at what didn't work, piles of chipped teeth
i keep gnetly vibrating the base of to settle and merge
so something rises i shouldn't repeat, should go where the gaps are,
where my foot might still fit
if the shoes are close enough to the toes
haven't forgotten how to hold
since we seldom rise to look over, to catch a better 2 inches of air,
like dogs catching flies in their mouth,  frisbees and flies and
mosquitoes, cats juggling cockroaches,
agents of change of decomposition, \

who knows why eyes met and this thin segment of the world wide river
is elsewhere & calm,
                        when change is not moving,    a new lumpy sphere
of visual indentations, convex caves dimpled with triggers    doorways   or
traps
coz you get caught there, stuck there, disoriented by the reality of it,
how it makes your river opaque just a blink, makes the river static and
stalling
coz youre so porous      so thin in resolution,    not enough pixels
sure of their codes, those off tones that round,
 those unintended relationships
dumping something into the river
we didn't know was washing into us--
a new layer finally revealed. another nerve brushed with a different strum

one hand
           for a split second
reveals the moving threads of its fray
                                         im into
covering myself with those stars,     smashed micro-gnats of change,
spores that stay in my skin, meteors of a million bits

a gauze curtain across the mouth of this unexpected room
surprising architectural memories,  like one morning the radios tuner going
further afield,
pulling several songs through each other, echoes raining back from space
songs around the sun, in the flares of mass nuclear uncertainty:
the smallest burning hole in the center of my brain, t   he event horizon
never closer without mountains, sudden chasms pretending to crack,
adding weight to the tease, i smell the bait from so many years away,
like a star i don't know how long its been decomposing, liberating music from
artificial stricture, retraining the ears to be dimensional, being naked
to add thousands of ears, thousands of photo-voltaics
increase the nerve areas receptivity, the number of different dances at once:

how one body can reflect whats unknown in another
after touching,   sinking some centimeters into each other

>Negativland uses uncleared samples extensively, and consider this to be

I recently found a used copy of an  out-of-print essay/monograph on
Laurel and Hardy, by Charles Barr.  His sketches of the great silents
that they made from 1928-1932 gave me a new appreciation for their
acting and the sophistication (if that is not too grandiose a word)
of their jokes.  The narrative structures of their violent gags and the
timing of their moves back and forth between anarchic and normative
behavior represent the culmination of this historical form.  The inability
of Stan and Ollie to maintain an adult role or to act for very long out of
any motivations but selfishness or tit-for-tat revenge makes for a useful
counterpoint to the more sentimental aspects of Chaplin.  If you have
enough time or resources to include them in any treatment of the silent
comedy, you might show a couple of their shorts (starting with Putting
Pants on Phillip).

Further to the proposed (by me) canonization, by the Poetics community, of
Mr. Warren Beatty, the information about his help in smuggling manuscripts
out of a formerly overly politicized police state known at the time as the
Soviet Union (do you remember it?) is on p. lviii of the "Compiler's
Introduction" (under the heading "Warren Beatty, the Crocodile
'Diplomat'") of Yevtushenko's Twentieth Century Russian Poetry: Silver and
Steel (New York: Doubleday, 1993). Worth a look to be sure. Big book. 1000
pages, and still with a strongly subversive tone throughout.
Also particularly worth a look is the previous section, entitled "And What
If Governments Were Run by Poets?" (p. lvi).
Amiri ("Be a spirit, not a ghost") Baraka does not get a mention, since
Bullworth hadn't appeared at the time.

Help! Who can (in the next ten minutes) give me the name of the Canadian
poet who did all his poems in Kling-On at the Boston Conference in July?
And what was the name of the lady poet who Doug and I both liked and gave
that odd speech on O'Hara?

Nobody does, they try too hard.
All this having been said, there is in fact very little humour, except for
the bare bones of bitter irony, in , say, Margaret Atwood and Doris
Lessing whom I've been checking out lately, and nobody here wants to
"discredit" feminism.
More importantly, for me at any rate, I still fail to find any humour in
Don DeLillo. He has been mentioned as a comic author but in the two of his
I've read - Libra and The Names - there are about as many smiles, ironic
twists, anything of that sort, as there would be, presumably, sunbathers
at the South Pole. Can somebody give me a title and page number where an
example of his humour can be found?

Mexico mourned writer and journalist Elena Garro Sunday, one of the
pillars of its literary world,
      who died Saturday at age 78 after suffering a heart attack. They
will bury Garro, the first wife of
      the late Mexican Nobel Prize winner Octavio Paz, in the city of
Cuernavaca. Paz died last April.
      Uno mas Uno newspaper called Garro "a pillar of Mexican
literature," while other newspapers
      published long extracts of her best-known work, "Memories of the
Future" (Los Recuerdos del
      Porvenir). She married Paz in 1937 and the couple divorced almost
30 years later. A vocal
      champion of social justice, Garo spent more than 20 years living
in exile in Paris after harshly
      slamming the 1968 massacre of 300 student demonstrators by Mexican
troops.

It's not at all surprising, is it, that one mode of Ashbery's writing -- the
mode of _The Double Dream of Spring_ for example -- is so well assimilated
that the _New Criterion_ reviews it positively.  The tone of complaint hinted
at in the same review about the repetitiveness of A's recent work is
overstated, perhaps, but not entirely inaccurate, particularly given Ashbery's
extraordinary refusal, early in his career, to fetishize any single
continuous, or essential, style.  In this phase of his work, in fact, each of
his books appears to develop out of a susceptibility, or desire for self-
estrangement.  This is evident particularly in _The Tennis Court Oath_ where
the closeting of homosexual content mirrors Ashbery's suppression of the
"voice" that in his previous collection, _Some Trees_, he says came naturally
to him.  Similarly, as Shoptaw points out, _Three Poems_  can be read as
effacing the "densely meditative" _Double Dream of Spring_, _Flow Chart_,its
predecesor _April Galleons_, and so on.

However it *is* revealing to discover that what remains unassimilated by
mainstream poetics in Ashbery's work -- those lines that the _NC_ found
"dreadful" -- should resemble that element in O'Hara's work -- the surrealist
O'Hara of "2nd Avenue" for example -- which many critics in their review of
the recent Gooch bio, seemed to slam.

To oversimplify, these 2 elements: 1. O'Hara's "unacceptable" poems --
including both the wilder surrealism of "2nd Av", "Easter", etc. & also,
formally eccentric poems like "Biotherm" from which developed so much of the
work of the 2nd generation New York School -- & 2. Ashbery's meditative mode
-- though in this case closer perhaps to _A Wave_ & _Flow Chart_ than to _DDS_
-- seem to polarize (too strong a word?) the recent _Talisman_ _Anthology of
New Am Poets_. (Which is not even to mention the excluded third term -- that
is, with the exception, arguably, of Rod Smith -- those poets most *strongly*
influenced by LangPo (Fitterman, Neilson, Brian Kim Stefans, etc.).  The _NC_
article seems in any case to point out, or at any rate to suggest, the
difficulties involved in "imitating" the Ashberyian mode (in the _Talisman_
anthology, a mode practiced for instance by Beth Anderson, Chris Stroffolino,
& Susan Schultz most obviously).  More interesting to me (admittedly a
subjective response) is what strikes me as the *less acceptable* work (from
the point of view of the mainstream) descending from O'Hara -- Jordan Davis,
Bill Luoma, Mary Burger, Lee Ann Brown, etc.  This work also seems to more
readily assimilate a wider range of New Am poetries -- the Beats especially --
while being capacious enough to incorporate the extreme disjunctiveness of the
most experimental Language texts.  If LangPo can be compared to Conceptual art
(with which it is roughly contemporay) in somehow problematizing the category
"literature," (making it in a way "impossible," in its aftermath, to write
poems, in the same way that it is said to be "impossible" to paint after
Smithson) then the Neo_Expressionist's have as counterparts -- in their
rejection of this "impossibility" -- the kind of maximalist poetics practiced
by Tan Lin, the 2 Davis' (both Jordan & Tim), Luoma, etc.

Would be curious to see how others see this.

Having worked for a time for Jim Cameron and as a development exec & staffer
for others in the biz, I can assure you that the power dynamics Elizabeth
refers to operate without respect to gender and are less likely to change
than the laws of gravity. So Elizabeth, your friend is either naive about
how the business works, or wonderfully idealistic. Even when it seems like
your unvarnished opinion is being solicited in earnest, the fact is that the
membrane is always less porous than it appears to be. And because directors
and stars are bouyed by the most extraordinary vanity, which insulates and
separates them from the world the rest of us dwell in, you never know when
your honest opinion is going to come back and tear a gaping chunk out of
your ass. This is why the whole industry is mired in mediocrity - because
everyone's afraid to say what they really think. With the bottom line being
CYA, it's amazing anything at all gets done. For Beatty to have arm-twisted
Fox into making_Bulworth_ is something of a minor miracle then, even for all
its flaws.

Funny, how in the past 48 plus hours since the U.S. techno
state-terrorist action (sure to inflame spiralling violence that will
claim thousands) there has been one single post about it (from Dan
Bouchard, hurrah) and a poem by Alan Sondheim, hurrah) and many, many
posts in quite rapid succession (more urgently forthcoming, no doubt)
about Comedy.

This on what is (who can contest it?) the largest single gathering of
"oppositional" poets and critics in the history of U.S. poetry.

1. Only the most serious artists can be really funny.
2. The short story is the ideal form for literary humour, possibly.
3. Dorothy Parker is grossly overrated as a comic writer.
4. Colette is somewhat overrated as a comic writer.
5. There are some absolutely head-spinningly hilarious stories in Flannery
O'Connor's sadly brief oeuvre.
6. Some of the funniest writing of all time can be found in The Complete
Stories of I. B. Singer, especially since you're looking for "Americans."

I very much like the introduction of comedy--Laurel and Hardy--into
a/our discussions on poetics. Spicer's response to Buster Keaton, and
others--has always seemed a perfect romance (a fine mess!) with cont.
poetics. THat the silent age was an age of true innovation--that the
medium of film itself was an intergration of new narrative
techniques--that the beauty--the delicate beauty and sadness and
lovliness of Keaton, L & H, Fatty A. , H. Llyod,  and the "other" big
star-- was a truly important art form--forum--as depicting a truly
"american" world (machine and man and woman--isolation due to industrial
rev., the fundamental sadness of capitalism, etc) as is the poetics of
"this" world (u.s.a? 20th cent.) in a way that very few had done before
--outside--of writing.  A wonderful book on Keaton--now o/p (Buster
Keaton) connects Keaton to Borges, Kafka (who most likely saw his work)
and Cornell and other plastic artists.

Let's talk more about film and poetry--about the silent age--about the
silence in our work. Like my --as my--question on location:  see The
Desert Landscapes as film! See Keaton as The Sonnets--!

Allow me to recommend the new film Regeneration, with fascinating
portrayals of World War I poets Siegfried Sassoon, who survived the
fighting, and Wilfred Owen, who didn't. It's a painfully thoughtful
anti-war film, realistic and never jingoistic. Beware the eyeball scene.

There's a great deal that hasn't been mentioned in the last 48 hours--did
you know that an appeals court has nixed sampling as a census tool, dimming
once again the chances for any real representation (I wouldn't hold my
breath waiting for a reversal)? But, except in the sense that poetry has no
borders, I'm not sure how relevant this is to the reasons that most members
of this list have gathered here.
I'm also less sure that I have a position on the bombings than I would once
have been. In principle I'm against firing missiles and very aware of the
damage our unchallenged dominance does and threatens to do. But the two
bombs in Africa wounded some 5000, most by any definition innocent even in
the eyes of the bomb-makers. One can question the efficacy of the US
counterstrike, but the principle of retaliation to limit future such events
is hard to argue with. I mean, that's a lost of maimed or dead who have
inner lives as rich as my own--real people.
Nor does world hegemony give the US a monopoly on brutality. The Sudanese
government, case in point, has over half a million notches on its belt.
In this case I frankly have no idea what I would do if I were king.
So, now you've had a post.

Kent is right of course. In this age of manufactured consent and
spectacular (literally) politics, the rapid demonization of Osama bin
Laden in the weeks prior to the bombings should have been a telling
signal that we were setting up a post-Hussein, post-Khomeini,
post-Kaddafi enemy to go after. He has an advantage in that involves
going to war with no state as such -- just the unilateral bombing of
"terrorist sites."

None of this is to say that the bombings in Nairobi & Dar were not
utterly real & horrible, but anyone who has watched the Irish situation
for all these decades (or Vietnam or Algeria in the late 1950s) could
tell you that military offenses against terrorism basically NEVER work.
What makes bombing politically permissable and, say, the use of such
weaponry against various IRA irregulars "unacceptable" has everything to
do with the skin tone and religion of the recipients of our cruise
missile services.

That some of the sites in Afghanistan that were targeted were built with
US money tells you something about the brilliance with which our foreign
policy has been conducted.

And -- answer me this -- if the same group of people who could not tell
that India was about to detonate nuclear weapons were to tell you that
they had "irrefutable" (or even just "compelling") evidence as to the
guilt of the bin Laden organization, how inclined would you be to
believe them?

I've noticed that the refutation of the idea that this was motivated by
domestic politics has been based almost entirely on the idea that the
plan was concocted 10 days in advance of the bombing, i.e., before the
Monica speech (debacle that it was). But, hey, everyone knew Clinton was
going to testify that Monday well in advance of that -- so that is one
explanation that doesn't hold a lot o' water.

I'm afraid that all we have done is to ratchet up the cycle of violence
one more ugly twist.

I'm not sure, Ron, that you or Kent are wrong, "of course," not having a
claim to your omniscience. I'm content to wait and see before coming to
judgment.
As to the domestic motivation, it's hard to imagine that the missiles will
deflect Hillary's anger. It's also hard to imagine, if there was to be a
raid at all, what conceivable timing would have changed your judgment.
Before the speech? A month after?
That being said, I have no doubt that Clinton hoped that draping himself
with the presidential mantle would help him, whether or not that hope was a
sufficient motivation.
Are you saying that for the sake of even-handedness we should have fired
missiles at Ireland? Of course, neither the Orange League nor the IRA have
attacked US installations, as far as I can remember.

Great quote!

I love Ashbery--always have, always will. And not because he excites me with

Updike is) but because I find him so humorous.

Most people that I dealt with at work the other day --- from clients to fellow

this effect:

"we bombed...we bombed seven sites..."

...now...

how might that might be changed to (for starters)

"The U.S. military bombed someone"

Dear List Folks,

Thank you for all the suggestions on comic material, which were rich and
thoughtful, and I hope more suggestions come in.  Clearly, there is a lot
of material out there which I had not been previously aware of.
Certainly, the comic has become an increasingly complex presence in
literature, poetry in particular.  Consider Emily Dickinson or Anselm
Hollo (as Ron S suggested) or Antler or. . .  I believe there's room for a
lot more theoretical consideration of what consitutes the comic and why it
has become so prevalent and so important, particularly (but not
exclusively) in poetry. Survival is at stake. Yes, to say someone is
"humorless" has been used as an attack -- particularly
on feminists and others who advocate change -- "Aw, can't you take a
joke?" -- as part of the phony "political correctness" slander many like
to bander about.  However, it is important to joke and to laugh at
ourselves -- and if anyone has to explain why perhaps it is not worth the
attempt.

As for this moment of bombs and (again) American aggression and
blindness in the Middle East, those of us who are outraged at the US's
arrogance had better laugh as well.  I have spent 30 years acting and
writing against US and Israeli policies in the Middle East -- and the
latest outrage is just that: the latest.  One of the funniest people I
ever met was the late Tawfiq Zayyad.  A wonderful poet, Tawfiq was the
communist mayor (from a muslim background) of Jesus's hometown Nazareth
and a member of the Israeli Knesset.  I visited him once on a fact-finding
tour with Gus Newport, former mayor of Berkeley, and as we ate and tossed
off one arak after another he told us of how he had to vote in the knesset
on the "Who is a Jew" question: here was the communist muslim from
Jesusville voting as an Israeli citizen in the Israei parliament on
whether or not someone could be deemed a Jew in order to have the right to
dispossess his own people. An absurdity so magnificent, so delicious, that
we all roared with laughter.  Tawfiq loved to laugh -- and the fact that
he was killed in typical Israeli fashion (a headon collision while driving
back from Hebron after trying to negotiate one more inch of Israeli
withdrawal) is simply one more bitter joke on the par of those in Emile
Habibi's "The Pessoptimist" (who ended up winning the Israel Prize to
the outrage of the rightwing).

Now, with 75 percent of the American people approving the bombings and
many of the rest probably confused (after all, the people who set the
bombs in Africa are strangely twisted), anyone who counters the
present whammy had better laugh.  What happened is the result of years of
US policies -- of backing the reactionary Saudi and Kuwaiti ruling
families, of never putting serious pressure on Israel to stop its
colonialist assault on the Palestinians, of undermining all forms of
secular Arab nationalism so that the choice is either its empty shell
(such as Saddam Hussein) or politicized Islam or defeat. . . I could go
on.

So, as was already said, laughter is serious business.

Again, thanks for all the help.

Kent,

More alarming even than the meteor that will destroy us (At Blockbuster
Now! Guaranteed!) is Madeline Albright's explanation that we have entered
the phase of the "war of the future" in which the imperial forces pursue
an organization funded by renegade financiers exploding bombs in public
places. Think she'd ever think the imperial forces are mainly renegade
financiers? or that terrorism is not diplomacy?

Problem for the day: If everybody's only bought off, how to buy them back
without buying in (selling out).

I think we can all agree that any one can make a body laugh. not everone
can make people cry. this made me cry at my desk today.

with the mention of northern ireland on this list i  thought i would share
some facts to cool down the theorizing on violence.

                              THE VICTIMS

- Avril Monaghan (30) and her 18-month-old daughter Maura, from Augher,
  Co. Tyrone.  Avril was the mother of three other children under the
  age of six and was expecting twins within two months.  Her mother
  Mary Grimes, nee Ahern (65), also died.  She was a native of Kanturk,
  Co. Cork, who, with her Omagh-born husband, had lived in Beragh for
  the past 35 years.  Maura and Avril Monaghan were the first of the
  victims to be buried.  Dr Joseph Duffy, Bishop of Clogher, was the
  chief concelebrant at the Requiem Mass on Tuesday.  Mrs Grimes, the
  mother of two girls and ten boys, was buried at Beragh on Wednesday.
  The chief concelebrant on this occasion was the Archbishop of Armagh
  Dr Sean Brady.

- Oran Doherty (8), Sean McLaughlin (12) and James Barker (12) from
  Buncrana, Co. Donegal, had joined their Spanish friends on the day
  out to the Ulster-American Folk park.  The Barker family came from
  England about a year ago in the expectation that they would find a
  better life in Ireland.  Among the congregation at the funeral on
  Wednesday were President McAleese, the North's First Minister David
  Trimble, his deputy Seamus Mallon and Minister for Public Enterprise
  Mary O'Rourke.  The Bishop of Derry Dr Seamus Hegarty had a special
  welcome for Mr Trimble, and the congregation broke into loud applause
  when Dr Hegarty  wished him well in his endeavours in the new
  assembly.  The Spanish victims of the tragedy were remembered
  throughout the ceremony.  Oran Doherty apparently dreamed of the day
  when he would visit Glasgow to see his beloved Celtic.  Instead his
  coffin was draped with an official Celtic flag and four members of
  the club, including Danish international Marc Reiper and youth coach
  Willie McStay, travelled to Buncrana for his funeral.

- Fernando Blasco Baselga (12) and his tutor Rocio Abad Ramos (24),
  both from Madrid, were on a language exchange programme with families
  in Buncrana.  They became the first people from outside these islands
  to die in the North in 30 years of violence.  Fernando's father was
  injured in an ETA bombing in Madrid in 1993.  Rocio was on her fifth
  trip to Buncrana and was the group leader.  The remains of the two
  Spaniards arrived back in Spain in the early hours of Tuesday and
  thousands paid their respects before the funeral services later in
  the day.

- Breda Devine (21 months), was from Donemana.  Her mother Tracey, her
  uncle Gary McGillion and his fiancee, Donna Marie Keyes, are being
  treated for serious injuries in the Royal Victoria Hospital.  Breda
  was buried from the church at Aughabrack where we had the poignant
  scene of her father Paul carrying her little white coffin.

- Fred White (60) and his son Brian (27), of Omagh, were together when
  they died.  Fred was an officer of the Ulster Unionist Party.  Both
  were keen gardeners and Brian was due to start a new job as a
  horticulturist with Omagh Council on Monday.  The family originally
  came from outside the town and the funeral cortege travelled the four
  miles to the little Presbyterian Church at Creevan with which the
  Whites maintained their association.  The Moderator of the
  Presbyterian Church addressed the congregation and David Trimble
  managed to attend this funeral also.  As with all the other funerals
  there wasn't room inside the church for all those who wished to
  attend and the majority of the mourners had to remain outside.

- Esther Gibson (36), Beragh, was due to get married next year and was
  to be bridesmaid at her sister's wedding next month.  A day earlier
  she and her fiance Kenneth Hawkes had a formal photograph taken to
  mark their engagement.  Esther was a Sunday school teacher and the
  niece of DUP Assembly member Oliver Gibson.  The Rev. Ian Paisley
  officiated at her funeral in the Free Presbyterian Church at
  Sixmilecross.

- Julia Hughes (21), of Omagh, a student at Dundee University, was home
  on holiday for the summer and had found temporary work in the
  photographic shop in which she died.  At her funeral on Thursday the
  President of Methodist Church broke down as he tried to offer words
  of comfort to her father Alec, whom he had met in his youth, "when
  faith was easy and life untroubled".

- Adrian Gallagher (21), of Omagh, who had already established his own
  car body repair business, had gone into town with a friend to buy
  some clothes.  His uncle Hugh Gallagher was shot dead by the IRA in
  1984.  Adrian, an only son, was buried from St Mary's Church,
  Knockmoyle.  Local clergymen from the Church of Ireland and the
  Presbyterian church addressed the congregation, as did Auxiliary
  Bishop of Derry Francis Lagan.

- Lorraine Wilson (15) and her friend Samantha McFarland (17), both
  from Omagh, worked together as volunteers in the Oxfam shop from
  which they were evacuated and sent off in the direction of the bomb.
  The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Dr James Mehaffey,
  joined a local minister for a private service in the home which
  Lorraine shared with her parents, two sisters and a brother, before
  her remains were taken to Cappagh churchyard.  Samantha was buried
  from Lislimnaghan Parish Church at Mountjoy on Thursday.  Her brother
  addressed the congregation and spoke of her love of music and horses
  and her desire to travel.

- Anne McCombe (48) and Geraldine Breslin (43), from Omagh, were also
  close friends, who it was noted were of different religions.  They
  worked together in Watterson's shop and were on their break when the
  bomb exploded.  On Thursday Anne McCombe's coffin was carried by her
  husband and two sons into Mountjoy Presbyterian Church where she had
  been a member of the choir.  The Presbyterian Moderator, Dr John
  Dixon, told the congregation that when the church's General Assembly
  met in June those present thought they were heralding a new era in
  which there would be no more funerals arising from paramilitary
  violence.  On the same day the remains of Anne's friend Geraldine
  Breslin were in St Joseph's Parish Hall near Omagh town centre where
  her funeral Mass was said by Fr John Forbes and Bishop of Derry Dr
  Seamus Hegarty.  Fr Forbes had officiated at her marriage 18 years
  earlier.

- Veda Short (56), of Gortaclare in Omagh, worked in the other branch
  of Watterson's from which she was evacuated.  A mother of three and a
  grandmother, her funeral service was held in Seskinore Presbyterian
  Church, where her friend and former Minister at the church, the Rev
  Albin Rankin, described her as a person "who gave so much to so
  many".

- Jolene Marlow (17), of Newtownsaville, worked in Omagh on Saturdays
  and had been offered a place to study physiotherapy at the University
  of Ulster.  While she was having lunch with her sister Nickie (15),
  she was evacuated and, like others, they walked towards the seat of
  the explosion.  Before the blast they had met their great aunt Rosie
  McNelis (78).  Both Nickie and Rosie are being treated for serious
  injuries in the Royal Victoria Hospital.  Jolene's A-level results
  were due out on the day after she was buried in St Patrick's Cemetery
  in Eskra.  The road to the church was lined by her team mates from
  the local camogie and football teams.

- Deborah Cartwright (20), from Omagh, was the daughter of an RUC
  officer and worked in a local beauty salon.  Had she lived a few days
  longer she would have learned that she had earned the required
  A-level results to take up her place to study at Manchester
  Metropolitan University.  The media respected the family's request to
  stay away from the funeral at St Columba's Parish Church.

- Elizabeth "Libby" Rush (57), of Omagh, was in her town centre shop
  when she was killed.  Speaking of his loss, her husband Laurence said
  that they had met at the age of 15, were married at 18 and had been
  happily married for almost 40 years.  At the funeral Mass Fr Michael
  Keaveney said that the bombing had brought to Omagh "the kind of fame
  we neither sought nor deserved", whereas "Libby represented what is
  finest in Omagh.  She was caring, warm and friendly".

- Alan Radford (16), was a pupil at Omagh High School and waiting on
  the results of his GCSE exams.  He was in town with his mother but
  left her briefly when the explosion took place.  Marion Radford later
  spoke with great dignity and no malice about her experience and the
  loss of her son.  Alan was buried after a Mormon service in the
  family home.

- Olive Hawkes (60), of Omagh, was killed instantly in the blast. The
  media was asked to stay away from her funeral, which began with a
  short service at the family home before the actual funeral ceremony
  in the small Methodist church at Mayne.  Mrs Hawkes is survived by
  her husband Percy, son Mark and daughter Mandy.

- Brian McCrory (45) was a crane driver and had simply gone into town
  to collect some pills from a chemist.  He was one of the last of the
  victims to be identified and is survived by his wife, two sons and a
  daughter.  At his funeral in Killyclogher it was estimated that there
  were twice as many mourners left outside the church in the rain as
  were able to get inside.

- Brenda Logue (17), from Loughmacrory, had travelled the nine miles to
  Omagh with her mother and grandmother for a shopping trip.  All three
  were in a shop on Market Street but Brenda went outside to see what
  was causing the commotion, just as the bomb exploded.  Brenda played
  in goal for her local Gaelic football team and for the Tyrone minor
  team.  Her friends from sport and school formed a guard of honour for
  her funeral at St Mary's Chapel beside her home in Loughmacrory.

- Gareth Conway (18), Carrickmore, had gone into Omagh to collect a
  pair of contact lens.  Like others among the young victims he was
  awaiting the results of his A-levels and was looking forward to
  starting an engineering course at Magee College in Derry.  A keen
  Gaelic footballer, his funeral at St Colm Cille's Church was attended
  by members of his club, Tattyreagh, and a eulogy was delivered by
  club manager Niall Darcy.   While it was local curate Fr Sean Hegarty
  who spoke of Gareth during the funeral Mass, also on the altar was
  Monsignor Denis Faul, who had taken up his duties as Parish Priest of
  Carrickmore on day of the bombing.

- Philomena Skelton (39), of Drumquin, was on one of her rare visits to
  the town with her husband Kevin, a well known GAA referee, and their
  three daughters.  They were buying school uniforms and one daughter
  was also injured.  When the bomb exploded Mr Skelton was in the shop
  next door, only feet from his wife, but escaped physical injury.
  Shauna (13), whose jaw was broken, was allowed out of hospital to
  attend her mother's funeral at St Patrick's Church, Drumquin.



                         WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE?

Everyone assumed that the bomb was the work of the "Real IRA" and on
Tuesday evening the dissident group claimed responsibility.  In its
statement it insisted that no one was meant to die and that the target
was commercial.  It went on to say that the telephone warnings (two to
UTV and one to the Samaritans) clearly stated that the bomb was 300 to
400 yards from the Court House.  No one was impressed and the statement
created further anger and disgust.  UTV responded by saying that the
messages it had received placed the bomb at or near the courthouse.
Six hours after that statement another was issued saying that it had
suspended its campaign of violence.  A discussion was to take place to
ascertain if members wanted to make this permanent.  Some observers
said that the second statement came as a result of some very explicit
threats from the IRA.

For some time now we have been led to believe that "Real IRA" is the
military wing of the 32-County Sovereignty Committee.  That suddenly
became very important as we did not know the identity of anyone in the
"Real IRA" but we were aware of some of the leaders of the 32-County
Sovereignty Committee.  We had also been led to believe that the leader
of the "Real IRA" was a former IRA quartermaster living in Dundalk.  It
did not take us long to realise that the media was referring to Michael
McDevitt, the partner of Bernadette Sands-McKevitt who helped to found
the 32-County Sovereignty Committee.  The pair were under the spotlight
for much of the week.  Without naming them, callers to Joe Duffy's
Liveline radio programme started to organise a rally outside their home
in Blackrock, a few miles south of Dundalk.  In the event those
attending the rally confined themselves to staging their protest in a
local car park.  The names of the couple eventually became widely
known.  At some stage Ms Sands-McKevitt phoned a local priest to say
that they had nothing to do with the Omagh bomb.  According to Fr
Desmond Campbell she was very upset and within an minute or so Mr
McKevitt took over the phone.  He insisted that he played no act or
part in the bombing and the first he heard about it was on the
television.  The couple own a business in the Long Walk shopping centre
in Dundalk and calls were made for a boycott.  This seemed to be fairly
effective but didn't satisfy many, including the other shop owners, who
wanted them out of the shopping centre.  Management obliged and Ms
Sands-McKevitt wasn't allowed to enter the premises on Friday.

On Wednesday Ms Sands-McKevitt was interviewed by Joe Duffy and she
reiterated that she knew nothing of the Omagh bombing and insisted that
there were no links between the "Real IRA" and her organisation.
During the interview she used the word "condemn" in relation to the
Omagh bombing.  The strategy of the 32-County Sovereignty Committee,
she said, was to use the United Nations to challenge Britain's right to
remain in the North.  Before the week was out the United States said
that she would not be issued with a visa in respect of a planned trip
next month.

The couple have threatened to take legal action against some sections
of the media and are being advised by their solicitors with regard to
their apparent eviction from the premises in the shopping centre.

Not sure overwhelmed is the word, but it seems that contemporary poets who
produce "too much" are regarded with some suspicion. Poems, in the Romantic
light we've grown accustomed to, are supposed to be produced sparingly, the
results of divine inspiration coupled with agonizingly disciplined (if
often intuitive) procedural methods. If writing poems looks too easy -- as
Logan says with regard to Ashbery -- then we wonder if the poet is just
soullessly phoning them in. Ashbery's not alone in being criticized for
high output; Ammons is another (three hefty volumes in 6 years, two of them
book-length serial poems), and Albert Goldbarth has been taking flak for
being prolific for 20+ years. Productive poets also suffer criticism (and I
think justifiably so) for their reluctance to break stride, to move out of
whatever mode brought them to prominence. Philip Levine's been writing the
same 2-3 damned poems on the same 2-3 themes in the same way for 30 years,
but as long as he doesn't produce a book every other year, nobody
complains.  Yeats was prolific, but at least he was willing to alter his
style to suit the changes in his own personal development.  Too much of a
good thing is okay; too much of the same thing is deadly.

----------------------------------

Joel,

I think production has something to do with it. While prolific poets
often write poems "like they were making pasta," oftentimes the
more serious offense is inciting the jealousy of fellow poets.

There was an article in the Washington Post magazine (I think) last

fall about the poet Lyn Lifshin, who flooded small magazines

for decades. While she isn't an amazing poet, when the reporter

asked her detractors to comment, many said nothing of the content

of her work, just: "Too many poems!" Lucky for her, John Martin at

Black Sparrow thinks otherwise.

A few days ago I downloaded a poem on the list beginning "and the
aliens, where are they, in our desperation," but I don't have the name
of the author, and have since erased that day's postings.  Can anyone
tell me who wrote the poem? Backchannel to

Just a comment to Mark Weiss...

I thought of back-chan'ing, as this kind of thing can get pretty drawn
out, and certainly ain't poetics.  But i guess it is important to make it
a public issue.

Mark's point that the two bombs set off in Africa, were ghastly and
criminal, i have no argument with...

But the US missles *also* killed innocent noncombatants with rich inner
lives...And the military role of the US in the world, and what it's there
for (to oppose democracy, reinforce big money, carry out terror and
destabilization, use pentagon symbolism to strengthen far-right social
agendas at home) make it pretty inevitable that there will continue to be
lots of deaths of people with rich inner lives...

TERROR IN FREEDOM=92S LAND: A HUMAN INTEREST (AMERICAN INTEREST) STORY

"Heightened security in Washington signals rising US wariness of terror"=20

(or, Steer the Panicked Crowd This Way=85)=20

"By Louise D. Palmer, Globe Correspondent, 08/25/98"=20

(modified by Daniel Bouchard, on BuffListChat, 8/25/98)

WASHINGTON - Security measures have tightened so considerably in the
nation=92s capital that tourists and area residents are taking the threat of=
 a
terrorist attack seriously in a way they never have before. At the
Washington Monument, where concrete barriers, more police, and a new
security checkpoint were added this weekend, Kenny Horseman admitted he felt
afraid, especially when his 10-year-old daughter Abby asked if she was going
to be killed.=20

[Ed. Obs.: The concrete barriers look real nice. They are the true monuments
to the American Century. I visited DC right after the Embassy bombings. From
Lafayette Park, Douglas Rothschild and I had a clear view of the Secret
Service snipers watching the crowd from the White House roof. It had vista.]

"We had to convince her she would be OK,=92=92 said Horseman, a registered=
 nurse
from Herlock, Md. "It makes you wonder if they are going to get us, and it
makes you worry.=92=92=20

Who they are is who they always were. All we know for sure is they are them.
And the other they is constantly informing us as to what them are doing,
usually right before we attack them. Right now, apparently, they are
stalking little Abby. But despite the Wonder-Worry phenomena now gripping
America, it is important to stress for the sake of the children that each
attack launched by the US military poses a threat to the safety of America=
=92s
Kids, even as it protects them. Through this process, the truth will set us
free.=20

"I was scared we=92d be bombed,=92=92 said Abby, with an embarrassed shrug.
Embarrassed
as a blend of orwellianisms, half-truths, and propaganda spit themselves out
into pre-fab Axioms of Freedom so that in the event of another attack on
Americans, we can all agree that we did not do enough the first time to
prevent it this time around and can indeed step up the Retaliatory Defense
Attacks with suffficient moral justification.=20

Since last week=92s US missile attack on an alleged terrorist network
(heinously disguised as a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant) in Afghanistan
and Sudan, which followed twin bombings on Aug. 7 at US embassies in Africa,
fear for basic personal safety is creeping into the psyche of some visitors,
who have long taken America=92s geographic isolation as a guarantee of
security. The psyche of some visitors has resisted this fear for years. Now,
egg on face, they are coming around to What=92s Right.=20

From Union Station and the National Museum of American History to the
Capitol building, more police, more barriers, and more gates were added as
protective measures. Every good American will be armed for protective
measures; Arabs and outspoken dissidents will be treated with suspicion
and/or jailed as the "war" intensifies. Poets and artists will be lauded as
they ask their noisy counterparts to keep it down. =20

Even before the embassy bombings, Osama bin Laden, the wealthy Saudi
believed to be the mastermind behind those attacks, had announced: "We do
not differentiate between those dressed in military uniforms and civilians;
they are all targets in this fatwa.=92=92

On the other hand, the United States has said it does differentiate between
those dressed in military uniforms and civilians except, of course, in the
event of actual bombings for which all pose of responsibility is discarded.
(Besides, who can tell?)=20
=20
And people, who last week had no idea what "fatwa,=92=92 a death edict,=
 meant,
now appear to be paying attention. Buy two "fatwas" before Labor Day, and
get a third "fatwa" half-price.

"Things feel out of control, but you can=92t live in constant fear,=92=92=
 said
Ream Hasan, a mother and part-time teacher in Fairfax, Va., touring the
Washington Monument. "These people want to stifle your sense of security,
but if you let them, they=92ve won.=92=92 Whether Ms. Hasan was referring to=
 the
so-called terrorists of Islamic persuasion, or the not-so-called terrorists
of the US military was unclear.=20

Another tourist, Mike Cahoon, a roofer from Manchester, N.H., said, "I=92m
thinking retaliation. Hit and you get hit back. It could be anybody anytime.
It could be somebody walks by you and boom.=92=92 Mr. Cahoon was then=
 introduced
to Ms. Hasan whom it was hoped would offer tutoring services for grammar and
clarity. Mr. Cahoon, however, refused, claiming to be an avid reader of
Gertrude Stein.=20

Cahoon said he doubted terrorists would reach into his corner of New
England. "What are they going to do, blow up the granite?=92=92 As an armed
American however, Cahoon vowed that no nutty Arabs would usurp his right to
live free or die.=20

Yaz Jadallah, a physician visiting from Lansing, Mich., simply said: "I=92m
not afraid, just more aware.=92=92 He was carrying several Nutcrackers for=
 Peace.=20

Rona Fields, a Washington-area psychologist and author of several books on
terrorist organizations, who has studied violent groups such as the Khmer
Rouge, said a slow psychological transformation is under way in this
country. "Unlike some of the previous fear syndromes that have circulated
through the populace, this is based in reality,=92=92 said Fields. For a=
 point
of reference she cited the age-old (and ongoing) threat of nuclear
annihilation, commonly known now as mass neurosis, with no basis in=
 "reality."=20

"We=92re not talking about a neurotic anxiety, but a response to warnings=
 and
the need to mobilize security.=92=92 Whether the advocacy of "the need to
mobilize security" is popular among professional psychologists remains
unclear, as does the meaning of the phrase. Fields suggested speeding up the
"psychological transformation" toward fear by teaching it in schools, for
starters, to little Abby and her playmates.=20

Fields added: "These are people who see men, women, and children as symbolic
targets to be snuffed out." Whether Dr. Fields was referring to the
so-called terrorists of Islamic persuasion, or the not-so-called terrorists
of the US military was unclear.=20

Several experts said education and preparation are needed. Several had their
ears to the ground. Several expressed desire for the Colonel=92s secret=
 recipe.=20


"If you give people an expectation that there will be reprisals and you
heighten awareness, then there won=92t be a shock when something occurs, and
that minimizes fear,=92=92 said a government behavioral scientist, who asked=
 not
to be identified.=20

Or: when death comes for the vigilant, the vigilant have one leg up on the
others.=20

I am one of those people who buy every Ashbery book that comes out--along
with everything by Bronk. I remember thinking at a certain point that all
he was doing was writing more "Ashberyese"--this was about 10 years ago
maybe. This remains a valid criticism, but where is the harm, ultimately?
All poets need a certain rhythm of writing to be who they are. Coolidge is
another example--if he didn't write so much he wouldn't be Coolidge. And I
don't think it is all redundant. Sometimes less is more but sometimes more
is more than less. The next Ornette Coleman record probably won't have
much that I haven't heard before, but I'll still listen to that too. I've
heard Ashbery writes many more poems than he publishes; can anyone confirm
this? This adds another wrinkle.

As for Ammons, his work does not hold my attention in the first place, so
I can't say whether his case is analogous to that of JA.

The only place I get a good sense of how the bombing affected folks in the
Arab world is The Christian Science Monitor. Their coverage has been great,
asking good, touch questions. They took a pretty good, internationalist
look at the Gulf War too.

In a way, the Monica thing was a great reverse pr move. The spinners took a
defensive offensive move, raising the wag the dog questions before anyone
else could raise those questions themselves, and diverting attention from
the merits or lack of the bombings.  Maybe they planned the Monica thing to
coincide with the bombing, instead of the other way around.   Just kidding,
I think.

Two things, with no visible correlation:

I want to call attention to Peter Quartermain's wonderful piece on Bruce
Andrews' work (esp. _Lip Service_) in the current issue of _Witz._ It's
the best piece I've read on Bruce's work and makes me hungry for the
forthcoming _Aerial_ on Mr. A.

I will be in New Orleans, at the New Orleans Marriott on Canal Street,
from Wednesday PM until Saturday morning (8/26 to 8/29). If there are
any Listafarians down that aways, give me a buzz.

dear rt:

My response was a calling really for a poetcis of response...seemingly
too often an ISSue is brought up without a cor.re.lative to the written
. As poets I'd think we should keep all/both on burners. If we discuss a
political issue as surely and simply a political issue (this or that
"thing") than indeed I believe the question--now what do we do--is
surely an important one. My Oppen quote had to do with the fact that
rather than write a poetics of politics Oppen (as many--inculding you
and Noah D. Lissovoy and many  others) actually became involved in
political movements (which drove him from the US and writing for some
time). I'm not sure about how a poem affects the world just yet--even
after writing for 25 years--a world that needs affecting in areas of the
deepest political strivings. And thus--I really wanted to ask--WHat,
now, my love?

So--you saying that poets are well "dipsoed" to deal it out-- I wonder
what that really means?  Say, to someone who doesn't read...

Dont leave out early S.J.Perelman, i.e. _Dawn Ginsberg's Revenge_ and
_Crazy Like a Fox_ . Nor his contemporary, Nathaniel West, an early
"black-humorist". Dont neglect Stephen Leacock's _Sunshine Sketches of a
Little Town_ (Or are Canadians allowed...I've forgotten the couching of the
original request). If they are, try _Debbie : An Epic_ , by Lisa Robertson.
This work (as many might) challenges the category of "comedy" or as I
prefer for these purposes, "comic writing," in that much of it is comic
from one angle only, and some of it, from none. Yet it is richly funny. As
is the writing of the other Perelman, Bob, and Listafarians (thanks, Ron)
might consult his early, less read (I suppose) books, e.g. _Seven Works_
and _aka_ . Michael Davidson's complex poetry is always liable to become
hilarious . . . don't miss his "Surfers' Chorus" (from which tome,
anyone?). Randolph Healy is one of the funniest poets alive, and
demonstrates that nothing can be funny that has not first been deadly
serious.
Excuse the partiality of this list, List, but the topic is so broad &
inviting. David

All of which is true, but not inevitably relevant, despite, say, Ron's
claims for what "history has announced" (a pathetic fallacy in more senses
than one). I'm claiming space as something of an agnostic on these matters.
I'm also claiming that the US military and the govt behind it is sometimes
as sloppy in its intent and execution as all of our other institutions. So,
in Haiti, for instance, as a byproduct of US  desire for stability in its
own backyard it helped install a less murderous regime.
I was profoundly opposed to our Iraq war, certainly couldn't understand the
urgency, and I think a lot of the pre-war propaganda blitz about Saddam's
production of "weapons of mass destruction" was generated as an excuse for
burying soldiers alive. Amnd the sanctions continue the killing. But then
it turns out, I think as as much a surprise to the CIA as to the rest of
us, that Saddam was much closer to making such weapons operational than
even the propaganda fantasists had told us. He had only arrived at that
point by virtue of being our boy on the block for a lot of years: we paid
the bills, but the boy had his own agenda. I don't think that this
justified all that killing, but I don't have any solutions to propose,
either. It's a complex world, and linear political theories may not cover
all the phenomena.
The question remains, I think, given where we are at the moment, what's to
be done? Perhaps the missile attacks will have no positive impact, although
as to increasing the ire of the bombers, it's hard to imagine they will
inspire them with a will to violence that they didn't already possess.
Perhaps the only thing that would work would be for the whole world to
share the same level of prosperity and power. Great, but not likely to
answer the immediate threat. Nor has prosperity stopped people from
throwing things at each other in the past. History, when he was my teacher,
told me that. So, if overt action won't work is there something else that
might?

I do think that this discussion belongs backchannel, and I'll be happy to
continue it there.

A HURRICANE IS LITERATURE THAT STAYS A HURRICANE


NAGS HEAD, N.C. - More than a quarter of a million residents and visitors
were ordered to leave North Carolina's low-lying, exposed Outer Banks today
as Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter) accelerated on a
path that could carry its fury into the barrier island chain.

The National Weather Service said Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the
alleged plotter)'s center with its 115 mph wind could be near the Outer
Banks by late Wednesday morning.

Terrorist warnings were posted from Murrells Inlet, S.C., to the North
Carolina-Virginia state line. Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged
plotter) watches extended south to
Savannah, Ga., and north to Cape Henlopen, Del.

While the Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter) was still
hundreds of miles away, the Atlantic was showing its effects with 10-foot
waves reported on the North Carolina beach. Gray, white-capped waves hit the
New Jersey shore in breakers 4 feet to 6 feet high, pounding onto the sand
with a dull roar.

Margaret Boone wasn't surprised that her vacation to the Outer Banks with
six friends was ending today rather than Saturday.  ''I just knew we was
going to get run home,'' said Boone, of Thurmont, Md.

The state of Virginia and some coastal communities elsewhere had already
banned swimming because of Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged
plotter) who is blamed for three drownings over the weekend in South
Carolina, North Carolina and Delaware.

''People were getting sucked out left and right,'' said Margate Beach, N.J.,
lifeguard Mike Palmer. One man was missing Monday in the surf off Point
Pleasant Beach.

By midmorning today, the Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged
plotter) was centered about 340 miles south of Cape Hatteras, which sits on
the Outer Banks 50 miles south of Nags Head.

Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter)'s outer ring of
clouds was not even reaching the mainland yet by late morning as Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter) moved toward the
north-northwest.

In three hours, Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter)'s
forward motion increased from 11 mph to about 16 mph, and it was expected to
turn gradually toward the north tonight, the weather service said.

Evacuation orders were posted today for the Outer Banks sections of Dare and
Currituck counties, the island of Ocracoke and beach communities along the
state's southern coast near Wilmington. Residents and tourists were urged to
head for the mainland immediately. Ocracoke is accessible only by ferry.

Although the Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter) warning
covered part of South Carolina, Gov. David Beasley said today there was no
reason yet to evacuate any of that state's coast.

People on the Outer Banks were urged to head for the mainland immediately.

But as dawn broke with a blue sky, runners took their morning jog on the
beach road and golfers kept their tee times.

Paul Peck, a retiree from Charlottesville, Va., said he'd never experienced
a Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden (the alleged plotter) and wanted to
watch the ocean change.

I'm in basic agreement with Mark on this and, while I appreciate his offer
to back channel the whole thing, I do think that the framing of this
political issue going on on this list is of relevance at least to a
discussion of rhetoric if not poetics proper.  I see 2 problems with the
rhetroic of conspiracy in regard to these bombings and the events
surrounding them. 1) the conspracy theorist always inadvertantly
apotheosizes the alledged conspirator: thus the Pentagon becomes
all-powerful and unknowable agent rather than what it actually is: a bunch
of mostly stupid people with mostly stupid views and too much power.  The
difference between a high Pentagon official and the right wing asshole who
manages your local Sears is mostly a difference in weaponry and scale:
which is to say, the sad truth of this bombing is that it probably
transpired on the basis of two related thoughts in the collective brains
of these numbskulls: a) "I like guns" and b) "those guys just bombed our
embassy, let's go kick ass."  We have a better chance of changing
political culture if we recognize this than if we assume the Pentagon is
run by a bunch of sorcerers bent on world domination.  2) a conspiratorial
view of events robs us of the one tool we as writers actually have which
is valuable, namely, the power of description.  I don't simply mean that
we should describe the events "actually" - I mean we should do our best
both to meticulously describe those events (the radical journalist's duty)
*as well as* describe the rhetoric via which those events were allowed by
the culture to proceed and stand (the poet's).  When we say, this is just
another example of American hegemonic strong-arming, we actually say
nothng at all: we are just the flipside of what gets said in Newsweek.
This is why I appreciate the questions Mark raises: what actually happened
and what might an appropriate response have been and how might that
reponse have led to better results (long term or short term).  bin Laden
is surely not a "victim" - anymore than the united states is a "victim" of
his bombing: to say so is to be wholly inaacurate it seems to me, & to
provide no foundation for progressive action, only confirmation of one's
beliefs.  In this way, the conspiracy theorist is a deeply religious
person, and the pure villain and pure victim appear in the service of a
fundamentally theological framework.  But the world of power politics is a
*social* world, a world of *complicity*.  And I think the best solutions
to this cycle of "terrorism" and retaliation probably come after this
admission.

staff,08/22/98)

I SPEAK IN CAPITAL LETTERS TO ZITNER=92S lower case=85


By moving forcefully against suspected terrorists, President Clinton won
praise even from critics of his foreign policy.=20

"I come to praise Clinton, before we bury him." (Helms)=20
"The noble McCain/ Hath told you Clinton was ambitious/ If it were so, it
was a grievous fault that he was not a Republican" (Gingrich)
"O liberal elite media! thou art fled to brutish beasts,/ And men have lost
their reason/ As polls indicate." (Starr)=20

Now, some foreign policy specialists say, the president should act with
equal resolve to manage another set of overseas problems that could be even
more important to the United States.=20

WE SHOULD BOMB EVERYONE WHO DISAGREES WITH US.=20

Iraq has suspended its cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors.=
=20

WE SHOULD BOMB THEM.=20

North Korea shows new signs of building nuclear arms.=20

WE SHOULD BOMB THEM.

Middle East peace talks have stalled.=20

WE SHOULD BOMB THEM=97ALL OF THEM.

And the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, is pushing ethnic Albanians out
of the province of Kosovo.=20

WE SHOULD BOMB THEM.
=20
In some of these cases, the United States has warned that there would be
stern consequences for bucking US policy.=20

THE BUCKING STOPS HERE! NO MORE WARNINGS FOR THE UNRULY. IF IT FLIES WITH
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC (SOON TO HAVE THE BEJESUS SCARED OUT OF THEM) WE CAN DO
WHATEVER WE LIKE. THE VIETNAM SYNDROME IS ALMOST CURED. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE:
FREEDOM TO PEACABLY ASSEMBLE? OR CHEAP GAS? ONLY THE NUTS WILL PROTEST.

Several foreign policy analysts called the antiterrorist strikes on Thursday
proper but limited.=20

BODY COUNTS WERE POPULAR IN THE 60s.

They said Clinton had put few US lives and little political capital at risk
in ordering the missile attacks - launched from faraway ships - on people
who are universally unpopular in the United States for alleged ties to the
US embassy bombings Aug. 7 in Africa.=20

SUCH POO-POOING THE DEATHS OF FOREIGNERS IS GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
CLINTON ATTACK OK; BUT NO BALLS FOR A BIGGER SHOW. SUCH EGGING-ON IN THE
POLITICAL ARENA IS LEARNED ON THE GRADE SCHOOL PLAY-LOT. HERE THOUGH,
PICTURES OF FIRED MISSILES ON THEIR WAY TO GLORY IS MORE POPULAR TO PUBLISH
THAN THE BLOODY CORPSES WHO CAUGHT THEM.=20

"It's not a very strong statement about our willingness to use force, and I
don't think it would change the resolve of Saddam Hussein or Milosevic in
Kosovo," said Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings Institution fellow, about the
missile strikes.=20

WHEN YOU DISCIPLINE (BEAT) A DOG BEFORE THE OTHER DOGS, THE OTHER DOGS LEARN
TOO. =20

Clinton=92s foreign policy team also stands accused of failing to solve
problems at home. The administration has said repeatedly that the
International Monetary Fund needs a cash infusion so it can make new loans
to ease the economic crisis in Asia and Russia.=20

THIS IS A PROBLEM AT HOME!!!=20
THE PRIVATE BANKER TO THE WORLD IS SHORT OF CASH.=20
THIS IS AN AMERICAN DOMESTIC PROBLEM.=20
OF COURSE, BY REPLENISHING THE FUNDS OF THE IMF,=20
WE ARE ACTUALLY HELPING TO FIGHT RACISM!!!=20

But the president has been unable to force Congress to set aside new money
for the international lending agency. Moreover, Clinton=92s push for special
"fast track" powers to negotiate trade treaties has stalled.=20

WHETHER THE "FAST TRACK" POWERS WILL ACTUALLY BENEFIT ANYONE BUT
TRANS-NATIONAL CORPORATIONS IS IMMATERIAL.=20
THE IMPLICATION IS THAT HIS FAILURE "TO FORCE CONGRESS" IS ULTIMATELY BAD
FOR THE PEOPLE.=20

Some critics blame the Monica S. Lewinsky sex scandal for the inaction on
foreign matters.=20

SOME CRITICS SUCK EGGS.

For example, Luttwak said, warnings by Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright that Israel must speed up the peace process have proven to be
empty. Clinton has been unwilling to rebuke Israel, he said, for fear of
angering pro-Israeli lawmakers who he may need later as the Lewinsky scandal
comes before Congress.  "So, at this point Madeleine Albright is
incapacitated," Luttwak said.=20

INCAPACITATED, DISCOMBOBULATED, & CONSTIPATED FROM TOO MUCH LIES=
 REGURGITATED.=20

Gary,
You must be referring to Charles Barr's Laurel & Hardy (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1967). Sounds interesting (it's on the
database of the library around the corner). It's great fun to watch an old
film after you've read an intelligent appreciative article on it. I once
made a list of all the films Frank O'Hara mentioned in reviews, but none
of them was out on video. This was about two years ago. I did the same
with some films Nabokov wrote about, and none of them was out on video
either. Oh well. I guess Laurel & Hardy is, or are, out on video, right?

I read an interview where he talked about occasions when he'd put on a
favorite piece of music & write & end whenever the music stopped. He spoke
of language as always available, like a current under the surface of daily
events. I thought this a generous approach. And I think generosity of spirit
is why I always like his work--though perhaps it also makes it suspect to
the "serious" consumer of poetry. I think what people may be sick of is the
how *pervasive* his style is--I mean, who hasn't written an Ashberyesque
poem?

The person who identified Christian Bok as the "inventor" of Klingon is
wrong, and he is not the poet who read poems in Klingon in Boston (I was
there; we drove down together). Darren Wershler-Henry read a poem called
"Translating Translating Appolinaire" which is a translation of bpNichol's
"Translating Appolinaire" into Klingon.

Billy:
I've discovered you on the Buffalo List serve which I joined in response to
dear Charles' passing, trying to find other ways to stay in touch the loss
of our trans-border messenger.  You are far more dedicated to responding to
some of the babble I've read so far, but every little once in a while, a
gem shows up.  I liked the interchange re: je suis un autre/ Joe and
Bromige's poem.

Sam Hamill (now married to old friend from LaConner, Gray Foster) gave a
fine reading from his new book Gratitude last Friday in Anacortes.  And I'm
lookig forward to the Blaser reading in Seattle for Bumbershoot.  Will you
be coming down?  FYI I've attached the piece I wrote for Charles.

Good to see you, old friend.  Let's keep in touch.  Is this what they call
"back -channel?'  I always thought that's where the salmon lay their eggs (
for those that still have eggs (or back channels) to lay in).

But first: Dan Bouchard, you are writing one hell of an unusual book.
A brand  new genre. Certainly different from your little poem
entitled "Make Way for Ducklings" in one of those fine little Mass.
Ave's. Go Dan go. Is it dexedrine or the pure fuel of contempt?
Amazing.

Mark Weiss and Mike McGee have written very thoughtful posts (no
surprise there in either case) on this bombing issue. But Mark, when
you say...

"The question remains, I think, given where we are at the moment,
what's to be done? Perhaps the missle attacks will have no positive
impact, although as to increasing the ire of the bombers, it's hard
to imagine they will inspire them with a will to violence that they
didn't already possess. Perhaps the only thing that would work is for
the world to share the same level of prosperity and power..."

...I think you miss something crucial. The U.S. action will create
_new_ terrorist bombers, many of them, who will be convinced beyond
doubt that there is no other language but violence with which to
engage the violent and arrogant enemy. On this dynamic, there is a
very interesting article/interview with a moderate and highly
esteemed Islamic scholar from Khartoum in today's NYT (sorry, don't
have the name in front of me). It bears reading because his is
perhaps the most sensible voice on this sordid affair that has been
heard in the U.S. corporate media in the past three days. He is
absolutely opposed to the bin Laden gang and he is very, very angry
about what the U.S. has done because, as he points out, it will only
feed an already spreading fire.

What is to be done? As Dan B. puts the obvious, we are all "armchair"
commentators here, but surely there is something we can individually
take a stand for in our own small ways. A step forward, it seems to
me, is to find our own ways of pushing for a U.S. policy in the
Middle East that is balanced and guided by true respect and support
for democracy and self-determination in that region. It is clear,
and I take it you will agree, that the history of U.S. policy in the
Mideast goes in the opposite direction. First and foremost, a new
direction would have to mean an honest and aggresive U.S. policy on
behalf of true sovereignty for the Palestinian people and a
principled rebuff of Israel's right-wing policies of militarism and
occupation. It would have to mean, as well, a radical turn away from
our revolting embrace of despotic Arab regimes, which millions of
Arabs are furious about and rightly see as wounding proof of an
imperialist giant's wild hipocrisy and greed.

To say this seems utterly simplistic and even embarrassing, I
suppose, for it's been said again and again. And the "expert" laughs
and says it is so much more complicated. But now the "experts" are
throwing bombs into Arab neighborhoods, and it begins to seem
that there is no other course the "experts" can bring themselves to
imagine. And how could they, if the underlying stakes are the crude
oil of our "national security" and the "defense" of  "our way of
life"?

The few thousand good people across the country who demonstrated and
were roundly ridiculed point to one aspect of "what is to be done."
There are thousands of U.S. citizens who have been working in other,
quiet ways for a more just policy in the Middle East. Probably their
efforts will come to naught, but there they are, trying, not throwing
up their hands.

I have one final suggestion on one concrete thing we might do on this
List to make a tiny difference, though I have to pose it in the form
of a question: How can we find out who the poets in Sudan are? Can we
use this occasion to make a contact with a few of them and start some
kind of dialogue on these "political" issues and on issues of poetry,
issues which finally, I think, are one and the same? It would be
fascinating to do this. We have the great World Wide Web--any
thoughts on this?

Kent--It's nice not to be villified for expressing doubts, but I really do
feel that this is not an issue for the list. (The britlist, by the way, has
been carrying on rather interestingly about translation) I do have issues

I confess too having a very formalist opinion on the matter of over-
production. Who cares about the degree of "inspiration" or whatever romantic
formulation of that sort behind a poem as long as the poem itself stands on
its own?

1. about Todd's film funny poetix request, I must point out my hero Miss
Anita Loos a helluva a gal who raked in buckets of dough writing hilarious
(& subversive) lines for female (& male) stars early on and whose
masterpiece _Gentlemen Prefer Blondes_ Edith Wharton called (tongue in cheek
or not) "the great american novel".  Any other fans? Her (Loos) biography of
the Talmadge sisters, the Brontes of the early screen, is also fab.  [+ my
sister lives near Talmadge St in LA.]

1a.  also Mae West's autobiography is a laugh & 1/2

2. More BULLWORTH watchout --
in response to Patrick's post, I only emphasized the Femaleness of my friend
due to the fact that I left her ungendered in my original post and then
Mike's post back referred to her as a HIM. I had left out her gender to
begin with cause I don't know how far and wide she wants me telling her
minor (?) work related irritations that involve the power brokers of
Hollywood, a place I, Patrick, have also worked, and a place that while
irritating perhaps to all, does save some specific types of irritation (read
supression or whatever) for its female workers, especially lowly ones such
as I was.  However there are those perks such as getting slapped on the ass
by rising stars.  Anycase, my friend is neither naive nor idealistic, as you
so quaintly describe her, simply a working gal with a functioning brain
(plus all that experience as a woman of color that Beatty so seems to
covet).  She knows and I know exactly what you speak of when you say the
(I'll call it "collaborative") membrane is always less porous than it
appears to be.  In fact, I think you've kind of made my point.  Tho I'll
never see Beatty as a hero for getting a semi-interesting flick made.  How
hard does that fellow have to "twist arms" to get what he wants?  If he
wanted me to remain interested in his oeuvre he most certainly woulda
thought twice about Bugsy, Dick Tracy, and whatever romantic remake that was
he did with his wife.  THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT SMART OR Adventurous, No James
Cameron, I won't take a moment of silence for your fake version of history
(tho I will watch the Oscars), No Kevin Costner, you don't have the lowdown
on Native Americans, etc etc etc.

extent that poetry is engaged, that we have our backs up/against a

I've definitely been a fan of Loos, also for that matter, Mae West's
writings. And for years I've been trying to read Lacan through the Marx

Subject:      Ashbery and the horoscopical
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

One of the things I like about Ashbery's longer poems (though this also
applies to some shorter ones) is the way he manages to reconstruct
story. His "and then" is apparently narrative, but, uh, life of the
mindish, reflective life of the poet and friends, countrymen...

Also, I like the way his poetry turns on a dime. Another poet who writes
a lot and turns on a dime is bill bissett, who wrote an excellent
sequence of prose poems about 'blur street' (bissett lives on Bloor in
Toronto).

There was a time when I was packing a couple of Ashbery books around
with me (Flow Chart and Three Poems) that I'd pick up at random. More
frequently than you'd think, the poem at hand was surprisingly relevant
to the circumstances of the moment.

Of course, there are many 'explanations' of this, but it doesn't happen
much, all the same.

Some time later, I happened upon a passage in one of his books where he
talked about horoscopes and such, and showed that he had thought about
writing in a somewhat horoscopical manner, which told me that yet
another 'explanation' was up.

Not that any explanation amounts to much without affinity. Not even that
explanation is required.

I mentioned this notion of the 'horoscopical' in Ashbery to a friend,
who thought it would be better termed 'alchemical,' but that seems to me
to obscure the connection with horoscopes and that writing.

Perhaps it simply amounts to my feeling of a special affinity with
Ashbery's writing. Certainly I feel that. I read him in my early
twenties and hardly understood a word. It seems there's writing for
different ages, or so I've found.

Yes, his output is voluminous, as someone else noted, and there is a
kind of 'noodling' that he does, like a musician, as someone else
intimated. But I am glad he does not wait for lightning.

Before too much more time has passed, and especially because I've had
differences with some of what Mike Magee has said in the past, I wanted to
say that I found his post yesterday, some of which is reproduced below,
remarkable -- wise and interestingly provocative.

Wise and prescient not to attribute shadowy omniscience to the folks at the
Pentagon (and, indeed, anyone) -- and provocative here:

 2) a
conspiratorial
view of events robs us of the one tool we as writers actually have which
is valuable, namely, the power of description.  I don't simply mean that
we should describe the events "actually" - I mean we should do our best
both to meticulously describe those events (the radical journalist's
duty)
*as well as* describe the rhetoric via which those events were allowed
by
the culture to proceed and stand (the poet's).  When we say, this is
just
another example of American hegemonic strong-arming, we actually say
nothng at all: we are just the flipside of what gets said in Newsweek.

Is this not the reason why some of us have expressed qualms whenever a
political discussion hits the list? Leaving aside the question whether
writers might actually have more than one valuable tool at our disposal, I
find this formulation VERY interesting. I've always admired good journalism
(some of which could be called "radical") for its ability not only to "get
at" the truth but create a version of its own. And my question is, why
separate the poet's function from the radical journalist's in this way (in
that much of the poetry I admire both "meticulously describes" and "exposes
rhetoric")?

There's a few more posts that I wanted to respond to in this (for me) week
of final papers and exams, but for now, just one thing more: was the person
who posted about Don DeLillo lacking humor really serious? Perhaps there's a
confusion about funny incidents and/or dialogue and a profoundly black
humorous (choleric/melancholic) view of history and language? Have you tried
_White Noise_ or even thumbing randomly through _Underworld_? Really, I find
that the more serious a writer is, the more he or she makes me smile.

Daniel Bouchard reads newstories & US government propoganda with the same
intensity as the New critics brought to certain poems, but just a bit more
'wit.' Well, I thought it made terrific sense. Thanks Daniel.

We do have a slightly different view from north of the 49th, but, as Billy
Little implies, our news services don't make as much of a difference as
they should (& I suspect that in Great Britain with good old Tony
introducing new, admittedly 'Draconian' anti-terrorist measures, it isn't
too much different either.

Mike Magee:

i believe you slightly misstate the political reality.

There is basically a system, and the way it functions will not change
short of altering the system.  Yes pentagon generals are stupid crude
jingoists.  But remember the point Alex Cockburn made about Reagan:  when
there is a social class and a system wielding great power and wealth, the
fact that its functionaries sometimes look like clowns is fairly
irrelevant.

The proper way to understand what the military machine does, is not to say
they are a group of omnipotent sorerers, as you put it.  Or to see them
thru the framework of "conspiracy theory."  But to understand what they're
doing and why.  And that has everything to with specific right-wing
agendas.  The great historian M.I. Finley once complained about scholars
who seem to feel that "the Romans built a great world empire in a fit of
absent-mdinedness."

I would argue that the equally hypertrophied U.S. empire was also not
built (and is not maintained) in a fit of absent-mindedness.  Like the
Romans, US bureaucrats and political hacks have a clear idea of agenda,
and to say i mean "world domination" is to set up a straw-person, and is
not to argue seriously.  Hegemony, would be a better word.

Mark, our positions really aren't so far off to my mind.  I would agree
completely that the Pentagon is an ominous social system: which is to say,
a structure which sucks and should be altered.  But I also think its
important to keep in mind that those within the structure don't entirely
understand it - they just know that they like it.  These two things
(understanding and liking) are *very* different, and the distinction has
implications in terms of how we, as various political progressives, go
about trying to change the culture known as the Pentagon.  Know your
enemy, is I guess the most succinct way to put it: again, I go back to my
Sears analogy - in an important sense, these dopes are just trying to keep
their jobs: it's just that keeping their jobs entails cozying up to
industrialists and concocting stories about global threats, and murdering
innocent people. Honestly, I don't mean this as a diminshment of the
gravity of the situation.  If credentials mean anything, I'll say that I
protested, vigorously ,in Boston and on my college campus in Worcester
against the Gulf War.  My only point is, I know many of these guys (family
and other random connections) and their main motivations are pretty
mundane - like I said, kicking ass, and protecting their own.  So, I hope
there's plenty of middle ground between our positions.    -m.

Excellent point, Mark, and one that underscores the hypocrisy of a
flabbergasting remark I heard on the news recently about the ability of the
national security apparatus to function smoothly in the event Clinton became
impaired by the Starr/Lewinsky flap. Some official or other remarked that
the system is vitally dependent on the Prez, or something to that effect.
That without the leadership of His Nibs, the system would grind to a halt.
Whereas in fact the system is designed to grind on with relentless
imperturability, immune to the caprices of mere politics and scandal - that,
after all, is part of what makes this a nation-state. It was amazing to hear
this blatant lie. More amazing to think that people might buy into it.

Mike Magee:

i believe you slightly misstate the political reality.

There is basically a system, and the way it functions will not change
short of altering the system.  Yes pentagon generals are stupid crude
jingoists.  But remember the point Alex Cockburn made about Reagan:  when
there is a social class and a system wielding great power and wealth, the
fact that its functionaries sometimes look like clowns is fairly
irrelevant.

The proper way to understand what the military machine does, is not to say
they are a group of omnipotent sorerers, as you put it.  Or to see them
thru the framework of "conspiracy theory."  But to understand what they're
doing and why.  And that has everything to with specific right-wing
agendas.  The great historian M.I. Finley once complained about scholars
who seem to feel that "the Romans built a great world empire in a fit of
absent-mdinedness."

I would argue that the equally hypertrophied U.S. empire was also not
built (and is not maintained) in a fit of absent-mindedness.  Like the
Romans, US bureaucrats and political hacks have a clear idea of agenda,
and to say i mean "world domination" is to set up a straw-person, and is
not to argue seriously.  Hegemony, would be a better word.

My inner life has been exceedingly impoverished of late, I hope that
doesn't make me a legitimate target for bombing.

Seriously, though, this is a problematic concept,at best, what is a "rich"
inner life, anyway? If the unexamined life is not worth living, then do
non-reflective people become less valuable, by implication? Or else are we
denying this quality of self-examination, say, to those who work at the
pentagon, by appealing to the "banality of evil" principle? (as I have
read in several posts). Is this any better than demonizing them?  What if
we can't simply condescend, intellectually, to those in the pentagon?
What if they are as self-reflective and worthy of our respect, say, as
managers at Sears?  What makes us so superior to them (the Sears
managers) in the first place?

        From September 18, 1998, to January 17, 1999 (the dates seem to differ
slightly as listed by two sources), The Neuberger Museum of Art, State
University of New York at Purchase, is holding an interdisciplinary catalogued
exhibit, "The Next Word: Text and/as Design and/as Meaning,"  According to the
Museum website "The Next Word explores new avenues that link imagery and
language within an artistic context, concentrating on the areas of Visual Art;
Artists' Books; Visual and Concrete Poetry; Graphic Design; and New Media, and
includes work by artists, poets, and a new generation of web-based designers."


        The Sackner Archive is lending some of their holdings to the exhibit,
including the ms./typesc. of my VISUAL VOICES:THE POEM AS A PRINT OBJECT
(Runaway Spoon, 1994), the book itself, and an announcement I prepared for
previous exhibits.


        My ms./typesc. consists also of poems excluded for reasons of time and
space from VISUAL VOICES, poems for which, incidentally, I am seeking a
publisher. One or two of the latter can be found on Scratchpad; examples from
the book itself are on the Runaway Spoon site at


http://www.interlog.com/~dal/rasp/


maintained by Damian Lopes at Prose and Contexts.


        Johanna Drucker is curating. I don't know which other poets'work will
be included. The opening reception is September 26, 1998, from 6:30 to 8:00 PM.

May I revise a hasty and careless remark from my last post? I had
asked: "Can we use this occasion to make a contact with a few
[Sudanese poets] and start some kind of dialogue on these "political"
issues and on issues of poetry, issues which finally, I think, are
one and the same?"

I could have better said "...issues which are never simply
separate and are often quite one and the same."

As in, for example, the Lycee question: "How have we come to know so
much about the French poets and their forms and so little about the
Sudanese?"

Someone one on the list suggested finding poets in Sudan with whom to conduct
a dialogue. I've done some preliminary basic research for anyone interested.
The best start seems to be
http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/5379/litframe.html, which includes a list
of Sudanese poets. I don't know if these are established figures or poetasters
who just want to get on the net. This site is actually part of
http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/5379/index.html. A progressive Sudanese
web journal is at http://members.aol.com/NewSudan/ourpoems.html. Another poet
has a page at www.ulbobo.co/umoja/98/index.html.

Want to address Listafarians on this topic of the military. They work for

I'm writing an article on 'the right to a bad language' - trying to
connect this to various linguistic so-called disabilities (clinical &
metaphorical) such as stammering, dyslexia, non-native speaking etc -
used as poetic devices, used in poetics. I haven't found many very
interseting texts that wd be relevant to this issue, Jakobson has been
useful, so has Bernstein, Basil and Charles, and Deleuze has useful
insights on stammering. But I haven't seen any texts that address the use
of a bad language & that problematize the question, i.e. what IS a bad
language? & how language may be misused in poetry. A lot of texts indeed
talk about this indirectly but does anyone know of texts that from any
angle address it directly?

This may be slightly out of your scope or off topic, but you might want to
look at some discussions of black English vernacular speech: from Ralph
Ellison's idea of the vernacular as symbolic action to HL Gates's The
Signifying Monkey to others such as Houston Baker, & Nate Mackey - who
discusses stuttering in relation to both Creeley & Monk in *Discrepant
Engagement*.  I think this is an interesting site for discussions of "bad
language."   -m.

Well, the list represents a partial rainbow of opinion, & this discussion
could go on forever, so I will try to be brief & address this question re:
life in general & poetry in particular.
As to the 1st I don't see the point in demonizing the US military, though
undoubtedly there are pressures from that direction to use the forces
trained & assembled. (As there are sometimes NOT to use them.)  Where was
the outcry on this international list at the innocent deaths at the embassy
sites.  The fact is a real threat exists from enemies in Iraq, Libya, Sudan
& Afghanistan which attacks without warning, against both government &
civilian targets.  How would you deal with it in their shoes?  Of course,
if you want to consider the whole government apparatus simply an instrument
of evil & oppression, you can be happy with the cartoons that generates.

This is not to say I support the pre-emptive strikes.  So to answer your
question I would say we all as citizens need to focus on the
moral and legal standards and restraints that should apply to
nation states with respect to the use of force, and to look for ways
to apply them on a national & internat'l level.  This is a challenge
to act that applies to everyone, not only in response to the current
crisis, but in general, and perhaps especially in the US, since as the
"dominant power" maintaining the "pax" through global policy actions
in relations with practically every country, the US behavior is the
environment. The government that applies cold war logic of pre-emptive
force at the end of the 20th century, and by announcing a "war" on
terrorism immediately raises the status of terrorists to that of soldiers,
seems blind.  But the issue is not so simple and "pre-emptiveness" does
not apply as a description of US actions alone.  How DO you respond to
governments or organizations claiming the right to use nerve gas & other
chemical agents to kill thousands of people?  Nations have a right to
defend themselves.  The issue is the dangers to all of us posed by
US exceptionalism - the assertion of dominance using short-term
pragmatic logic. War logic. Not to mention the wisdom of acting with
arrogance in a region already steeped in many levels of anti-Americanism.
The issue of state violence - actual & potential - is international in
scope.

On the poetry level: beyond saying that poetry too tries to assert itself
as a mode of awakened interpretation and reflection on present realities,
and that it might provide one means to oppose war in general - I don't know
what else to add on that.  Except that while you get friendly with Sudanese
poets you might want to look into the nature & history of THAT government
as well.  Nevertheless, in the US, it seems the main focus of somebody
troubled by the pre-emptive strikes should be to counter the enormous
pressure of received opinion, spin, P.R., and so on.  Polls say most
Americans support the attacks.  But there are many Americans who would
know & care more & differently if the forum for such public debate on
these issues was created. How would poets help bring that about?
I think a forum on peacemaking is needed in this world, not just a
forum for polarized antagonisms. - Henry Gould

Hi, David.

I always thought the nature of the servant-master relationship was mutual
captivity.  (See P.G. Wodehouse.)

But yes, this is an anguishing situation, and that it seems to have been
publicly dropped (NPR had a piece on a recording of tree frogs today) is
incomprehensible.

Hello, Jaques:

The impulse to polarize is academic, and by that I mean merely academic. My
first response to your post would be a question: what do you gain by
distinguishing between poets you imagine attend to one poet, versus poets you
imagine attend to another?

It's odd to think that everyone's options might be limited to, or limited by,
choosing a precursor poet, or one area of one's precursor's material, & writing
out of that space, the late twentieth century filled with Pierre Menards
churning out various Quixotes, poetry reduced to juried dog show, poets as
purebreds, poems spermal in function. Are you a terrier, a Doberman or a golden
retriever? Silliman has a line somewhere in the Alphabet about the Actualists,
& their purported failure to "give birth" ? i.e., to inspire future legions of
poets, as though this were why, after all, we were writing, some sublimated
desire to procreate. It's not why I write. I'd be surprised, even slightly
horrified to discover it was why the poets & writers that mean anything to me
wrote. To colonize the future?

You grant the Talisman anthology an authority I find myself unable to do ? it
not seeming, to me, comprehensive. It's ultimately a magazine with an ISBN
number. The poets of "my generation" (gag me, please) whose work means the most
to me, well, a few are included, but most not. Of only one of them not included
could you make the mistake of imagining their dutiful, monogamous attendance
to, say, O'Hara: Ange Mlinko ? though, knowing something of her reading habits,
I'd say there's been equal attendance to Bernadette Mayer and, believe it or
not, Gerald Burns. But, many many others, too. And, believe me, Jaques, if this
were all her work had to offer, I wouldn't bother reading it. What about Eric
Malone? How does his series of books from early 97 (Magic Marker Poems; A
Backwards Book; etc.) fit in to a schema that pitches Ashbery against O'Hara
against (all of?) Langpo? Is Brenda Iijima's anachronistically titled Person(a)
an O'Hara because it's personal or an Ashbery because it's "intellectual" or mo
Langpo cuz the poems, despite their emotional weight, seem (looked at purely
formally) driven by a deep immersion in the words as they surface into the
poem? (Forgive the dopey metaphor.) Wendy Kramer's collages include both words
and pictures and when she reads them in public she "reads" the pictures, too ?
how does this figure into a polarized (tripartized? bleah, bleah, bleah,
ptoooiee!) schema? Is she a concrete poet, or the opposite of a concrete poet?
Does it matter? How account for Rachel Levitsky's poems of desire, wanderlust,
anti-stasis ? yeah, sure, she's done "read-thru"s of Ashbery (a poem written
while reading Ashbery's work), and that's sure to influence her, even
elsewhere, but ? really? En todos? Joel Kuzsai's Oz poems ? quickly now, whose
ghost wrote 'em: O'Hara's or Ashbery's? I don't know quite how to account,
using any schema, for Don David's (not to be confused with Dan Davidson)
bizarre sex poems ? do you? Jeff Conant's writing, a good portion of what I've
seen anyway, seems to come out of a profound dismay with his country/culture of
origin. I mean, his distaste for it is palpable, his work sometimes burns with
a kind of intensity, a particular kind I don't see much in O'Hara, Ashbery or
any Language Writer I remember reading. George Albon's very formalized work
equally attends to a kind of despair with the culture, and though I know
Ashbery was a big hero of his, very little of his writing resembles Ashbery's.
Is Bob Harrison's tendency toward abstraction Ashberyian or is the emotional
space the writing comes out of O'Haraesque? Into what hole should we peg Sheila
E. Murphy? Laurie Price? Nada Gordon? Wherefrom arrives Christian Haye's
ultimate dissatisfaction with poetry's inability to seep outward, into the
world, in a way he'd prior imagined it might? And so on, blah blah blah.

But, to respond within the terms (& names) of your post: Davis, Luoma, Brown &
Burger are hardly writing "less acceptable" work than Anderson, Stroffolino or
Schultz. Luoma reads (his prose, at least) more like Hemingway, Brautigan or
Carver (Lished Carver?) than O'Hara, to me. I can imagine no writing more
acceptable by mainstream standards. Brown's writing is equally pared down,
simple, lyrical, evocative. I see much more of an attendance to Niedecker or
Dickinson than O'Hara. To the extent she is "writing out of" any of these poets
(& I would never assume this was why she writes), the impulse seems not at all
at significant odds with the mainstream. I can imagine her reading on MTV to a
very appreciative audience. & I don't think, having posed for Glamour ("Poetry
is Hot!"), she'd consider that an insult. Anyway, it's not meant as one. Davis
is the only one you mention who, okay, does seem, at least through the window
of Talisman, influenced by O'Hara, even by "Second Avenue" O'Hara (as though
there might be two, or three, or four O'Hara's, polarized against themselves).
But take a look at his new "train" poem. O'Hara never wrote that flatly. Or, if
& when he did, he was probably making a point about flatness moreso than
writing out of that situation.

Influence is unavoidable. But does that mean that E, F, G and H have been
influenced by A, B, C and D, respectively? And, in the terms of your post,
TOTALLY? Stroffolino has been influenced by O'Hara as much as Ashbery, by
Shakespeare as much as O'Hara, by Corso as much as Shakespeare, by Riding as
much as Corso, by Baraka as much as Riding, etc. ? & I think he'd be
disappointed, as would anyone, to see his writing read solely through Ashbery;
or, more to the point, through an academic filter pitching Ashbery against
O'Hara. This is someone who, when I ask advice ("Hey, should I try calling
Carolina again? Maybe she's just too shy to call me back!") recites passages
from Ovid, Shakespeare or Dylan. (His three most-quoted, at least in advice to
his roommate. Well, okay, last night it was the Stylistics.) For Chris as for
myself as for anyone I'd ever bother to continue reading, the poets we read,
love, attend to, including ourselves, exist for us outside of mere
art-historical time.

Yours,

Gary

Henry,

What do you mean by "demonizing" in terms of the US military? "Demonizing"
is the paving machine towards a justified attack. Saddam Hussein, Khodafi,
Khomeni, Arafat (in the past), Noriega (after the US military dropped him
from the payroll): these are people who have been demonized through the
sources from which we all get our information about the world.  I don=92t
resist their demonizations (or, refute the crimes they=92ve committed); but=
 I
struggle against the omission of their counterparts from the demon list.
This would include heads of state on friendly terms with the US: Latin
American dictators, Suharto (altho when a change was called for, his crimes
suddenly became interesting to the US press), and so on=85 the list is long.=
=20

How did the demons in the first list come to power? Were they once allies to
the US, or were/are their enemies? Or, to come to the point: are the "real
threats that exist from enemies in Iraq, Libya, Sudan & Afghanistan," which
you cite, created in a vacuum? You ask "How DO you respond to governments or
organizations claiming the right to use nerve gas & other chemical agents to
kill thousands of people?" What=92s the difference between killing them with
gas and agents, and killing them without gas and agents?  What it amounts to
is that the US claims to set policy in regions far and wide outside the US.
And the US claims the right to kill those who oppose those policies (e.g.
The Gulf War).=20

I hate terrorists. All terrorists. But because terrorist acts were committed
against "my country," I do not wish to sanction my country to commit
terrorist acts in retaliation. After all, what did we do in Afghanistan and
Sudan but "attack without warning?" That the US has claimed war on an
individual man and his unhappy band of armed men makes little difference. We
got no thank-yous from either country. Like the "war" on drugs, we can now
go after (if not bomb) any "network" of thugs if evidence of their links to
terrorism is compelling enough. What I hate most is the hypocrisy and lies
that flow out of Washington.=20

If you mean by "demonizing" of the US military, a cry of outrage against the
pre-emptive strikes (or similar actions) then I strongly disagree with you.
The military, the Pentagon, indeed the entire government, may be made up of
ordinary people with ordinary concerns, but once an order is given, a course
of action decided upon (whether it=92s barring medicine from entering=
 post-war
Iraq or firing missiles against a terrorist "network") then none of that
means much of anything.=20

What is a terrorist? Someone who creates terror=97violence against people,
civilians and military. Who do Afghanistans and Sudanese consider to be
terrorists? Who do Palestinians consider to be terrorists?=20

What if a terrorist "network" were discovered in Germany or Poland or Japan
or India and there was "compelling" evidence that this group had attacked an
American embassy? How quick would the US be to bomb them with missiles? Or
would we find another way? One might say the governments there may be
friendly to a US investigation and hunt for perpetrators, but what real or
significant recourse does either Sudan or Afghanistan have against the
missile attacks? Time and again, the US proves to the world it will not
tolerate X or Y by attacking countries that cannot really fight back=97look=
 at
Panama. How many people read in the papers about the residential
neighborhoods that were decimated? We killed thousands of people, and lost
23 American personnel. Before Iraq we were all told that Saddam was a
general on par with Hannibal and his army were seasoned veterans fighting
the holy war, and omigod lookout. How many US military personnel were killed
in that war? 147. How many Iraqi dead? Thousands? Hundreds of thousands?
Actually the number continues to rise.

You cite the need for nations to adhere to "moral and legal standards and
restraints" when it comes to violence. I don=92t disagree with you. There=
 are
in fact many organizations whose purpose is exactly this. But who has ever
heard of them or their efforts? And what organization is going to have the
power to enforce it against a military strength like the US, especially
when, as Jesse Helms points out, "America=92s differences end at the water=
=92s
edge."=20

Look how the UN inspires conspiracy-plots among assorted American
right-wingers. "Her wants to grab Chicago=85 Him big bureaucracy running our
fillingstations." (Same idea, different context.) So even to express outrage
at US military action is indeed a big step=85 to do so in this country makes
one so far "left" and so far out of the mainstream that anything you say is
quite implausible; not to be taken seriously. You should see the looks (or
non-looks) that groups who convene to protest such actions as the recent
"pre-emptive" strikes get at the Park Street subway stop in downtown Boston.
It=92s like running for president if you=92re not a) Democrat or Republican=
 or
b) a millionaire: you=92re a nut.=20

As for poetry:=20

"All I have is a voice
To undo the folded lie,
The romantic lie in the brain
Of the sensual man-in-the-street=20
And the lie of Authority
Whose buildings grope the sky:=20
There is no such thing as the State=20
And no one exists alone;
Hunger allows no choice
To the citizen or the police;
We must love one another or die."

--Auden, from "September 1, 1939"=20

I think the originator of this phrase, (Mark Weiss) meant that **many
people in general** including Sears managers in some cases, do have rich
inner lives.  He was using the phrase to refer to the people wounded and
killed in the two African anti-U.S. attacks.

Those attacks didn't take place at major universities, or whatever.

And i second Mark W. on this: i've known a few janitors and factory
workers with rich inner lives (just horribly depauperate checking
accounts!)

The original (rather jaunty) post wasn't as elitist in its assumptions
about richness and innerness as your approach quoted below, Jonathan.

I would argue that if you think they're working for us, you are dwelling
happily in Cloud-kuuukuuuLand.

They work for a series of layers of political hacks, who are drawn from
and who serve (exclusively) the owners of capital.

Now it's possible to change this, but it is veeeery slow.  But you wanna
change the military adventures, (while in the meantime it's a good thing
to organize against 'em directly) you gotta ultimately change who has
power.

You start by deepsixing the one-party system, and its pseudo-party with
two right wings, the Republicrats.

And yes there are ways to do this; but this ain't a socialist-strategy
listserv, so 'nuff said.

Dan, I respect your position & am very close to it.  It is good to be
reminded about Panama & other shameful military actions.  Where I
disagree is the argument that the US govt-military is a monolithic
& constant force for evil in the world & that forums for opposition
to state violence in general are ineffectual & meaningless & therefore
all we can do is crank up the left-hysteria rhetoric which really does
"demonize" the US & the US military.  This to me is unrealistic & even
unfair in a world-system that also includes Russia, China, Sudan,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Libya... various countries I
would hesitate to characterize as innocent victims or harmless
nonviolent governments.  As I tried to suggest, the challenge should
be to get at the roots of international justice & "peace law"
rather than jack up the rhetoric.  Righteous indignation and
blind self-righteousness - patriotism & jingoism... protest may
be a moral imperative, but I was responding to D. Bromige's
open question about HOW to proceed.  No more talk from me.

Ah, that great, long letter from Dan Bouchard, to whom I take my hat
off on this issue. Henry, just a quick point: Your caution that the
nature of the Sudanese government be checked into before anyone
enters (naively, I guess) into contact with Sudanese poets is
uncharacteristically silly on your part. Who ever said anything
about Sudan's government as noble entity? And why do you seem to
assume that Sudanese poets would not be among the first to educate us
on the repressive aspects of their government? Hoo boy, Henry!

Item 1: There is a letter in today's NY T'imes that asks a
wonderfully simple question: The writer points out that the U.S.
govt. has been harboring terrorists from various countries for years,
allowing them to operate with de facto impunity from U.S. soil (the
most obvious example being Cuban "freedom fighters" who have blown-up
civilian airliners in mid-flight, carried out germ-warfare attacks on
Cuban agriculture, bombed buildings in Havana, and so on. Given the
righteous U.S argument about pre-emptive self-defense, is not the
Cuban government now more than justified to retaliate against Little
Havana targets in Miami? Hmmm...

Item 2: There is mounting evidence (see also today's NY Times) that
this "bin Laden VX factory" was nothing more than an unguarded
pharmaceutical factory producing commercial drugs.

And let's check-out the Sudan poetry web-sites put up by Ramez Ejaz
Qureshi. Perhaps a statement opposing the missle strike signed
jointly by American and Sudanese poets? Anyone think this might be a
good idea if it's feasible?

* The latest British company to hire a poet-in-residence is the
London Zoo.  According to director-general Richard Burge, the
poet's jobs will include writing guides in rhyme for visitors and
"help[ing] to interpret the lives of the animals."  News of the Weird
reported earlier this year that the large department store Marks &

with woman as traditionally viewed in public discorse, as a sexual object

Oh, OK Henry. I'll be sure to inform myself that Sudan is a
repressive police state WHILE I try to dialogue with some poets
there. That way I won't become confused and misled. And I'll be sure
to be wearing my desert turban WHILE I do this, because this will

Can't speak for Henry, but speaking for myself --- maybe because it could
get them killed? Or at least jailed & tortured?

Any notion that people necessarily can speak freely is more than a little
naive.  I remember driving through then-East Berlin in a car with windows
closed with a then-East German colleague who would not talk about anything
remotely political, so fearful was he of the government.  Bad as EG was
back then (and it was pretty terrible) it was not as bad as many places
today.

I tried one of the URLs, which said the page didn't exist. I think a
joint statement would be a good idea - especially in light of the new
information re: the chemical weapons factory. Anyway, you might want to
check the URLs and repost? Perhaps there were errors?

Two other points - where there is of course a category "Sudanese poets"
who would or could make such a joint statement - and I worry always about
naivete; when I reread Kristeva On Chinese Women, for example... But too
often we're manipulated by events here as well - in both the Gulf War, and
now this, the control of information has reached unprecedented heights -
we literally do not know who is acting in our name, and what they are
doing. So a statement or at least the gesture of moving towards a state-
ment, is at least a statement itself, that we can speak - that the fact
that we don't know all the facts is itself problematic.

Certainly true, Judy. I am thinking, actually, that there may be
poets and intellectuals from the Sudan living abroad or in forcible
exile, and that these may be the most likely to have access to the
WWW. But I am not certain about this.

Still, the wonderful NY Times article I mentioned yesterday on the
Islamic scholar from Khartoum did seem to point to a willingness by
at least some intellectuals inside Sudan to speak out in opposition
to their govt's policies. In fact, if I can borrow your phrase,
history shows that it is more than a little naive to think that
repression leads to intimidated silence across the board.

Dear me Mark, you have only to read my post to become aware that I know
what the current situation is, i.e., one that renders the statement "they
work for us" on the face of it absurd. But I saw value in asserting the
truth : we pay them; they serve us. This truth is honored, like they say,
in the breach not the observance, but it had better remain the truth, for
else the lies we live among will take its place.

I find your sketch for changing the present and for releasing us from
Babylonian captivity, well, sketchy. What might be a first step? Could you
admit it if you thought that there could be none?    David

        I am a Brainwashed Sudanese Poet.
        I have been taught my country
        can be right or wrong,
        I have learned give liberty lip-service
        or I could be killed.

In my youth I praised the beauty to the skies
which then seemed safe enough. This was
politically incorrect some decades later.
In the finest academies our taxes could bear
I had my brains washed.  As economy downturned
they had to make do with the laundromat.

                I make new start over here.
                English is most difficult language.
                For politicians. Its plethora
                of synonyms means the hypocrite
                will always be disclosed
                many thanks to his word-choice.

  I regret to have lost friends in latest
  international incident. Death seems so final
  under present conditions of science.
  Short-sighted of me. They had been
  very much so until final seconds. Alive, I mean.

            Thanks to brainwashing
            the first person is used
            or misused very much
            when I write. This is because

            hmm, well . . . I do not want
            lumping together is category
            provided. Mud hut cell
            "room for one more" like hell.

Soon if spared to I shall do parody
of Brainwashed Yankee Poet in broken
Sudanese, with grammar-flaws for joke.
I shall begin, then I shall go on
otherwise to stop and alter course
prove me unmanly. But at the bottom
all poets are sibling rivals, common
under the dirt. And next to them,
all people living in the world I imagine.

             Brainwashed Limey Poet Kipling
             used term "fuzzy-wuzzy"
             while wogs begin at Calais.
             I have given away all my money.
             My cogitations turn uncontinuously.
             I like Brainwashed Gallic Poet
             Rimbaud who say "My Romantic Brethren"
             then lose his inventory to his exploitees.
             With my looks I could have been one of these.

Show me a poet who is not brainwashed
and in return I show you a tabula rasa.
I love the house I was born in
as I love the desert rats who brought me up.
I am American too for my deep love of liberty
brands and stamps me one. My feel of justice
tortures my transatlantic soul excuse the term.

               Hardly more than a child myself
               I watched the children play to see
               justice is born in the brainwashed bone.
               I fell asleep. In the dream I am
               able to meet Evil. He look just
               terrible, like me or you
               in a rage. Otherwise I sit at coffeeshop
               and watch veils. Scribble, scribble.
               Not much good can come of that,
               my illiterate companions show their teeth.
               Some are all I have, except Wednesdays.

Power, billions of money, slaves. These count.
I was glad when the Crude missiles missed me.
Brainwashed Sudanese Poets don't grow on trees.
We are the consolation of our race
which is after all the human. But
it is intended for disconsolation
as Power's ultimate insult
to look at it and nowhere else.
Kill the motherfuckahs or it's your ass.
An American wrote on one of our walls.
Give me some money so I forget to say more.
In America there are blades of grass.

Actually, i've said much of it here before--and thus my feeling that it
could be inappropriate, as it is a matter of socialist strategy, not
poetics.

Basically, we have to build the left through both electoral and other
forms.  The best approach in recent years is a form of mild social
democracy, which (in my experience) is often quite effective in reaching a
wide range of working people, and connecting up and giving impetus to
things they already feel about the existing political fiasco.  This form
of mild social democracy is embodied currently in the Labor Party, the New
Party, and in a coalition of Green, socialist and labor parties called the
Independent Progressive Politics Network.  I work with all these projects
as much as i can.

The idea is to reach the huge majority of adults who don't vote (which has
been growing since 1945) because they know the Republicrat machine is
agin 'em, and not for 'em.

There needs to be greater unity.  In fact most of the formations i've
mentioned should work on merger, but won't be doing so in the next couple
of years, fer sure.

See, there are plenty of "first steps."  Why, the longest journey begins
with one, i'm told....

in solidarity if not in step,
mark

Well, there is the &nbsp; code (IIRC) which will put a space in the text.
Of course, since you can't be certain of which font the browser is using,
you can't be certain that the text will line up properly.

Another possibility is putting the text in <pre> tags. That will make the
text appear in a monospaced font, which might be kind of ugly, but you can
maintain exactly the indentations you want and have them be the same on all
browsers.

The first solution is better if you need the text to be indented regularly
(every indented line can have 5 &nbsp; in front of it); the second is
better for more complicated sets of indentations.

Gary Sullivan, in his response to an earlier post of mine, makes many
intelligent observations, some critical, about my reading of the recent N(A)P
anthology.  He writes:  "The impulse to polarize is academic, and by that I
mean merely academic. My first response to your post would be a question: what
do you gain by distinguishing between poets you imagine attend to one poet,
versus poets you imagine attend to another?"  I think the polarity I described
in my post was already initially complicated by the fact that I identified its
2 elements in examples taken solely from work of Ashbery's cited in the _New
Criterion_ review -- the inference can then easily be drawn that if the
O'Haraesque surreal exists in Ashbery, it may certainly be present in, say,
Stroffolino's poetry also.  However, not only do I not mean, as Gary says I
do, to "pitch Ashbery against O'Hara" but in fact think  it would be a mistake
to position  either/or both of them "against . . . Langpo."   _The Tennis
Court Oath_, after all, is for Langpo, if it can be said to have one -- its
most precursive text.  (In fact Shoptaw, in his Ashbery book, shows how, in
O'Hara's brief poem series, _Little Poems for the Admirers of Ashbery's
"Europe'_, Ashbery's influence leads O'Hara to write, stylistically, quite
persuasive Language poetry.)  In any case, it wasn't from an "academic"
perspective that I framed my remarks but, instead, as a poet -- that is, I am
interested to know how it might be "possible" to write poems informed by
Langpo when, in its aftermath, the very question of writing poetry at all has
been problematized -- inasmuch, as Langpo --to recapitulate remarks I made
earlier -- effectively challenges the very category "literature."   Still,
instead of seeing generational influence from the entirely negative
perspective that Gary's post seems to suggest, I prefer to regard influence in
a *collaborative* sense, NOT "Pierre Menards churning out various Quixotes,
poetry reduced to juried dog show, poets as purebreds, poems spermal in
function" [terrific & horrifying image Gary!], but -- oppositely -- as an
undoing of social & psychic double binds, one that makes us aware of the
process of writing itself & its context while at the same time expropriating
myths of origin & authenticity.  The crucial question for me then is not, "is
it original?" but "is it interesting?" (a question which would subsume others
as well such as: is it reactionary? illegitimate? incredible?).  In the N(A)P
it struck me that many of the poets represented there had attempted to clear a
space for their writing by *collaborating* with either Ashbery's more
meditiative poetry or with the O'Hara of "2nd Ave," or   "Biotherm."  While I
didn't at all mean to rule out other influences, or a confluence of these
influences, these 2 seemed, to me, to be dominant.  In fact I think I prefered
the O'Haraesque precisely for the reason that it seems more capacious, more
susceptible to "contamination" from other poetics.  (Of course this polarity
does not really begin to account for the variousness of the present scene --
for instance I found the poems chosen for _Moving Borders_ less assimilable to
a heurmeneutic &, partly for this reason, more successful.) As for the
"authority" of the N(A)P, it seems, I agree, conceived of very much like a
magazine, but the "semiotics" of the anthology form -- no matter how
strenuously the traditionalist understanding of the anthology is depreciated
by the editors -- make it appear inevitably to reach for a greater "weight" --
not to mention the practical consequences of its wider distribution.

Look, if we have to have this discussion on the list let's just avoid spin.
Today's Times article about the chemical trace found at the Sudanese
factory says that it's unlikely, but remotely possible, that the compound
in question could have commercial uses, although none of the sources quoted
knows of any current such uses. The Islamic scholar, who sounds like a very
nice man, thinks that the US, rather than treating the Sudan as a pariah
state, should reward it by acknowledging its very few anti-terrorist
gestures, among them the ouster of bin Laden so that he could do business
elsewhere. He also suggests that rather than send missiles the US should
stage an Entebbe-style military raid on Afghanistan to kidnap bin Laden.
I'm not sure that either action would win us a lot of friends. Let's
remember, on the subject of US reward for good behavior, that Sudan is not
too highly regarded in sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps because it has been
slaughtering hundreds of thousands of its non-muslim, non-arab sub-Saharan
citizens for years. Sudan itself is perhaps the worst artifact of bad
colonial map-drawing--there are almost no cultural affinities and no
traditional ties uniting its two parts. And on the matter of kidnapping, if
Afghanistan considers the missiles a violation of sovereignty it's not hard
to predict what they'd say about a military force on their soil.

If we're going to cite the Times, by the way, it reports that in an
apparent attempt to nudge policy a bit out of its current groove the
Justice Dept. has indicted a bunch of well-placed Cuban exiles for plotting
to assassinate Castro. Maybe the monolith is developing a few facets.

Why, given the current paucity of information, do we as citizens have to
decide the issue faster than a speeding sound-bite? Why, more to the point,
absent sufficient knowledge, do we have to arrive at an opinion by the
application of formulaic political theory? Especially in this crowd, which
tends to be hostile to formulas in most other areas?

By the way, the one suggested Sudan poet site that I was able to reach is a
list of authors with descriptions of their careers and some blurbs, but no
texts. Of the only three in English, one writer is English born, bred,
credentialed and resident, of a Sudanese father and an English mother. He
does apparently write about Sudanese politics. Another is sub-Saharan. The
third I believe lives in exile. All are primarily novelists, although one
is said to write poetry as well.

If indentation and placement are crucial (which theey are) you could
also look at some of the things vispoets have done, e.g., make the poem
an image and treat it as such.

the <blockquote> tag will indent a section of text,
but long lines or narrow windows or large fonts on
the client browser will wreck th linebreaks...
<pre> is preferable, as far as i'm concerned, both
to maintain linebreaks and inter-word spacing--
& if you add font face tags you can override the
ugly monospaced fonts that're the default fr most
browsers...

beautiful post gary
you should do an anthology
or a mag with an isbn see if i care
but my guess would be that phil whalen has a profounder influence on this
generation whether they read ashberry more or not, ashberry/ohara dichotomy
is like downtown and uptown, very new york, very provincial or parochial,
narrow world view like new yorkers seeing thru those little slots between
the scrapers thinking the sky is thirty yards wide and half
filled by the goodyear blimp, bill bissett has had a profounder influence
that john ashberry, bp nichol
ashberry is cool but if anybody is trying to write like him..., i'd say the
real dichotomy is david antin and jerry rothenberg these are men who keep
making a difference, james koller, john cage, james schuyler, lenore kandel
and joanne kyger  the east bay south bay dichotomy they've made more of a
difference than ashberry ever will, roberts creeley and duncan there's a
dichotomy, New yorkers need to try the second note on the pennywhistle,
Michael McClure and Diane DiPrima, the coyote/wolf dichotomy when you get
right down to it Stephen Rodefer and Heathcote Williams have had more
influence on this generation than Ashberry, Ashberry/ OHara a difference,
it is to laugh, the New Yuck School eclipses the sun.

        Well spoken-out, Billy, Phil Whalen has been a wide, wide
influence, he proposed a poetry in which ANYTHING can enter, although not
everything could exit, like "I want this and I want that," but never mind,
he was the big W Coast organist to keep Olson in perspective, there's a
pairing for you, a polar pairing, Olson/Whalen, although not quite as
amazing as your Rodefer/Heathcote Williams. Might be healthy to try to come
up with some equally asymmerical couplings.

When is there going to be a Philip Whalen Conference/Celebration as there
was for Robin Blaser back in '95 when the world and we were young?  Robin
himself suggested just such an event.

I hope everyone on this List owns a copy of _On Bear's Head_ . They must
have printed plenty because they were remaindered everywhere.
Influence--funny word, as Dorn remarks. Upon whom? Upon the succeeding gen
of poets, of a certain bent, absolutely; not so much upon the
scholar-critics who canonize, though, as Ashbery or O'H. Under that kind of
focus, Whalen turns elusive.

Is there any place in Ash or O'H where the author confides the tonal
equivalent of "I must stop masturbating so often" ? If not, be worth asking
why . Uncool? Whalen is also pretty spacey. Thats definitely uncool in NYC,
no? Noone wants to be the airhead....well, gotta go. Have a nice day.
David.

I've been following the Sudanese situation fairly closely for about five years
because of a book I'm publishing shortly, and I was very glad to see Mark
Weiss mention how the country was saddled with a disastrous colonial boundary.

There is no excuse for the million + deaths that have occurred in the civil
war together with the recent neglected famine (when thousands of lives could
have been saved if there had been a more accommodating attitude towards aid in
Khartoum.  A truce was granted only when the roads were likely to be
impassable for the military)  But Mark rightly points to the huge problem
established after General Gordon's crazy heroics in the 1880s, memorably made
more crazy by Charlton Heston with Laurence Olivier playing the Mahdi.  You
have Islam in the north, now heavily influenced by El Tourabi and the
Brotherhood movement, and Christian, animist, and various left-wing groups in
the south.  Sudan was a country hotched up as a result of fallout from the
Egyptian situation of that time.  Then you add the modern ingredients:

Everyone says these days that the retreat into Islamic integrationism in the
Arab world has been partly a response to Western capitalistic imperialism --
excellent op ed by Graham E. Fuller, former vice-chair of the National
Intelligence Council at the CIA in Los Angeles Times a day back on addressing
Muslims' real problems.  However, the article strangely made no mention of the
uninvolved Africans killed in Kenya, which is the unfortunately usual
blindness.  Once you have a fundamentalist demand in Khartoum that state and
religion be combined and that Sharia law should rule the system, there can be
no breakaway from this -- by strict belief, a jihad immediately threatens any
major attempt at this.

A theoretical answer would be for southern Sudan to secede, the ancient
colonial arrogance at map-drawing to be rectified and the borders to be
rationalised in some way.  Unfortunately, the northern lands are comparatively
poor while minerals and oil have been discovered in the south.  Politically,
secession is impossible.  Religiously, unity is an absolute requirement.
Under other circumstances, one might regret the interference of Christianity
which has been helping to divide a state already divided against itself; but
the integrationist attitude towards women, etc., makes an Islamic state of
this kind hard for any Westerner to contemplate comfortably.

This is a tremendous mess.  The missiles have flown into Sudan from another
world of politics. And they have complicated the future in some way as yet
unguessable.  I don't have much to say about them that has not already been
said.

But I'd much appreciate it if Mark Weiss could post the website where he found
those Sudanese writers.  I've never heard the names of any that have stayed
inside their own country (there must be some in exile, but I lack
information).  I find it hard to believe that any Islamic culture won't have
its crop of poets, even conformist ones.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I have become interested recently in theories of aesthetics which
emphasize the renunciation of "pleasure." So far, I have seen this theme
in Kant, Adorno,Ortega, Bourdieu (who offers a critique of this tendency),
and a few others. If anyone can steer me to other classic instances of
this phenomenon (or to discussions of it) I would appreciate it.
Basically, the problem is the following:  why do so many theories of
aesthetic "pleasure" emphasize askesis, or the renunciation of aesthetic
pleasure itself?

By the way, Fray Luis de Leon was not a medieval poet, Henry. I don't know
that he wrote a sonnet a day--his complete poetry is a fairly thin volume.
One of the heresies of which he was accused was the suggestion that it was
possible to improve upon the Latin translation of the bible (the vulgate).

Deleuze's _Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty_ as well as Sacher-Mosoch
proper may be helpful. Like with his critique of Kant, here Deleuze is
trying to locate that nexus of the 'aesthetic' 'pleasure' and
'renunciation' viz. 'itself'.

You are correct that GIF-ing would be the "best" representation of the

and make them load faster...getting exact name and availability of the

You might want to look at a book by Robin Kirkpatrick titled
Dante's Paradiso and the limitations of modern criticism : a study of style
   and poetic theory
(Cambridge UP, 1978)
- he or she argues that Dante was interested in & practiced a kind of
stylistic renunciation.  It's been a while since I read it - might be
related to Donald Davie's arguments in his book Purity of diction in
English verse.

Dear Dodie & others,

The gif file idea is often the most attractive but, as Dodie mentions, less
than idea for people with lower end computing power. (The poem, in this form,
also looses its status as "text" ruling out the possibilities of text-based
search tools which becomes more of a shortcoming as the size of your site
grows.)

This matter of 'do we make the poetry text or an image' really has some
implications ie, I worry about taking from our works their status as text.
It's
like poetry becomes idealized or removed from circulation in certain senses.

I'd vote for the <pre> tag idea. Also, lowering the basefont size by one
within
the <pre> tags will help people who have pre-4.0 browsers and large font
settings to still see the <pre> text within a one screen width.

Dodie:

The usual approach to Web pages where you want complete control over the
appearance of the text is to use PDF.  You really don't want to use GIF for
this.  The PDF approach is a bother to some people, because you have to
download the Acrobat player.  My suggestion would be to make it author's
choice:  either HTML alone, both HTML and PDF (choice available via links),
or PDF only.  This is the closest you will come to pleasing everybody.

To implement this you will need the full version of Acrobat on the machine
on which you develop the Web site.  You import the text into a word
processor or desktop publishing program and then print to PDF.  It creates a
PDF file with the same appearance as the printed version.  Unlike GIF, in a
PDF file text is still searchable, and it should load faster once the user
has the player.  It acts a lot more like text than a GIF will.

Yes, there's a New York writer who took on Whalen as an influence: Ted
Berrigan. Joel Lewis can tell the story better than I; On Bear's Head was
insanely expensive when it came out? Didn't the poets picket Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich to get them to bring the price down? It wasn't
first-printing-Ulysses expensive (didn't they charge what was at the time a
working stiff's monthly ((annual?)) wage?), but out of line.

Anyway, David, what's all this conjecture about what would be cool in New
York? I don't understand.

I hate PDF.

It is a very nice option, allowing documents to be seen exactly as the
designer formats them, but it requires a relatively powerful computer. My
home computer, one of the last of the non-Power Macintoshes, struggles with
PDF files. It takes forever for Acrobat to load, forever for the files to
be displayed on the computer, and once they're displayed they're annoying
to navigate and read.

It would be worthwhile to have the option of PDF, but you'd still want an
HTML foundation, especially if you're trying to be friendly to people who
don't have the fastest and best computers in the world. Certainly if I went
to a site and was required to look at everything through PDF, I wouldn't
bother reading it -- and there are many people using computers worse than
mine.

Jacques, first let me apologize for dropping, twice, the "c" from your name.
Duh. [Smacks now-reddened forehead with palm.] Anyway,
influence-as-collaboration is a beautiful thought, and I don't think you,
personally, are an academic. But, I do think that the impulse to parse into
art-historical slots is, essentially, an academic impulse, whether held &
attended to by poet or professor. So, I couldn't stress enough how little, at
least for me, "in [Langpo's] aftermath, the very question of writing poetry at
all has been problematized" matters. It's not for me a thought really worthy of
my anxious energy. I argue with Fatimah about this a lot. She genuinely
believes that, in the wake of conceptual art, painting is dead. "Whatever" is
finally all I can, finally, offer her. If I were a filmmaker, the fact of Paul
Sharrits or Michael Snow wouldn't keep me from shooting, say, five minutes of
dogs barking from behind fences, straining at leashes, crapping on the street,
& so on, however much this gesture might seem closer to Marie Menken's "Go, Go,
Go," or whatever, than to Wavelength. I would, to cop Jordan's groovy
street-lingo, "go, girl." You betcha.

Ultimately, Rachel Loden's poem about "geeky Philip" emerging from the shower
made more of a lasting impression on me, as an instance of poetic expression &
intelligence than, say, Perelman's book on the "problem" of "genius." Brilliant
academics MANUFACTURE problems; less brilliant ones adhere to previously
manufactured problems. Poets ENCOUNTER them, while writing, while considering
writing; brilliant poets work through them rather than find themselves
debilitated by them. So, my question, now, Jacques, would be, is your perceived
position vis-a-vis the wake of language writing a problem you genuinely
encountered? While writing? As a consequence of writing poetry? Or was it
something you received, pitched by others as a problem? Because I don't want to
deny the possibility that this is genuinely of import to you. It's just that I
can't imagine why it would be, nor how it emerged, for you, from the actual act
or process of writing. Maybe what I would ask of you is a statement or
description, sans academic jargon & ideology such as "hermeneutic, semiotics,
precursive, contamination, problematized," of that instance when you, Jacques
Debrot, realized, for yourself, palpably insistent, that "the very question of
writing poetry has been problematized."

I wanna respond to Billy, Jordon and David, & will later today. (David, you
reminded me of Whalen's admission of beating off into a cantaloupe, I can't
remember the name of the poem, it's in Like I Say.)

In the meantime, Jacques, thank you for your reply, and really-really, I'm
interested in your response to the question I raised above, would be grateful
to have it.

Such much,

Gary

Why does it have to be black & white, academics & poets?  seems like parsing
& polarizing & categorizing is the inevitable danger or down side of making
fine distinctions.  There's also a kind of poetry in academic detective
work.  I'm just glad somebody's actually trying to read something closely
& hearing things in it.  You're right, Gary, to be wary of this sort of
brand-naming on automatic pilot for the sake of an orderly hackademic
slummation.  But it doesn't have to be that way.  what the diff between
polarizing along Ashbery/O'Hara grid & along academic/poet grid?
(is this me talking?) (I like all the posts on this thread myself)

Jordan & Listmates : Jordan handily brings up the Berrigan-Whalen
connection. and I thank him for his correction : me writing NYC when I only
meant O'Hara & Ashbery--sorry. As to _On Bear's Head_ being expensive, my
copy was priced at $3.95 in 1969, for a book of 400 pp. Compare this with
$1.45 for _Meditations in an Emergency_ (the 1967 reprint; 52 pp); $2.50
for _The Maximus Poems_ (1960, 160 pp); $2.45 for the Scribner's _The Gold
Diggers_ (1965, 158 pp); $1.95 for _Testimony_ (1965, 115 pp); $3.95 for _A
Day Book_ (1972, unpaginated, my guess is 150 pp), and it doesnt strike me
as at all outrageous. I think the _length_ of it was some cause for comment
(as for the somewhat "high-end" price). Most surprising to us out west was
that this publisher should take an interest in Whalen's work.

 I was an Acting Instructor that year, so had a tiny cushion a number of
fellow-poets lacked; I suppose I found $3.95 affordable. Then again, Robert
Duncan, who had all manner of books sent him gratis, may have given me an
extra copy.  But perhaps protests _were_ staged, and the price reduced on
their account?  David

a misuse of language in poetry is it possible
do you mean the chinese in the cantos
do you mean ackers logorhea
the roaring in mcclure?
the marx in zukofsky?
the whistling in blaser?
the dialect in Berryman?
the soundings in Olson?
misuse is a misuse in your query
and "bad", is that way cool language?
in which case baaad might convey your meaning better
or is bad=naughty like Frost was, not using all the commas he was supposed

Or is bad merely stinkeroo in which case almost all how to write pieces

If i'm not mistaken, Don Allen was working for Harcourt, Brace briefly and

Jordan & others, many of the question marks in my original post were glitches;
apparently whenever I type ellipses, they're translated, by the Buffalo server
or whatever as question marks. It's a bummer because I love ellipses. Anyway,
as Henry reminds me, by pitching poetic impulse against academic impulse, I'm
doing, essentially, what I accused Jacques of doing, so I'm going to respond to
Jacques' point that there seems to be an Ashberyian drift and an O'Hara drift
by saying, simply, I don't see it, or feel it, as palpably as he does. I've
already said why I do or don't (mostly don't) see O'Hara as primary influence
of the poets he'd mentioned. I mean, so, I disagree with you, I don't think
Jacques' point is, on looking into the work myself, accurate. But, you seem to
agree with him. So, that would be interesting: could you, and Jacques, you too,
do close readings of some of the work by poets Jacques mentioned and help me
better understand how this conclusion has been arrived at?

I can't speak for Chris, certainly not with respect to whatever authority he
might grant a project in which his participation was significant. I sense, and
tell me if I'm wrong, anxiety or disappointment that I simply find myself
unable to grant this volume any more weight, as barometer of contemporary
poetry, than the latest, well, Talisman. I attend to, find relevance in, & do
love, what genuinely compels me; not to any & all things apparently compelling
to the culture, or subculture of literary/arts administrative coteries. As we
all, I think, do, if to greater or lesser degree. & if the world is truly full
of amputees, one wants to know who dropped the bombs, who laid the mines.
[Sidenote: Coffee House Press published a book called Atomic Ghost a couple
years back, a book of (mostly nuclear) weapon protest poems. One of the
granting authorities was Honeywell. I'll bet Daniel Buchard could tell you what
they manufacture.]

David, the copy you have of On Bear's Head is a paperback. It was the price of
the hardback that was picketed. Or, so I read in one of Rexroth's essays. I
don't remember offhand what the price was. But, Billy & David, yeah, Whalen, &
duh, Whalen/Berrigan, which I won't go off on here, having posted several
months ago en length on what I felt Berrigan had found of use there.
(Continuous present being one thing, which Whalen discovered in Stein.) But,
this idea of Whalen allowing more in, well that might be why I return to him
more than any other more-or-less contemporary American poet. What I don't find
elsewhere, I'll find there. Or, maybe, being from the west coast, it's in part
a question of matched sensibilities. I don't know. I just think he's great, &
it doesn't matter to me whatsoever if university professors think so or not.
Nor that he's absent (speaking of anthologies) from the latest UC Berkeley that
Rothenberg & Joris put together. (Many wonderful W poets are missing: Whalen,
Welch, Wieners, Wheelwright, though the latter may be too early for that
volume.) W is for "Whatever."

Billy, do you really live on Song Street in Nowhere, Canada? If so, dang man,
that's like, Groove Factor 10. I would, though, never do an anthology. I don't
like how they're read, how they're used. They promote laziness, complacency and
grant authority vis-a-vis taste & relevance to agencies with mere capital &
literary/academic reputation behind them. Every poet & reader should discover
for him/herself what's of genuine relevance to their own lives & art. Is this
attitude, to the extent it might draw someone "away from the numbers," what
Jordan means by amputee? If so, I'd rather lose my limbs than my soul. I don't
think, however, that it ever really need come down to that.

Ciao for niao,

Gary

Really, Mark, the spin here is coming from you. The article said much
more: It quoted American experts in chemical warfare and analysis as
saying that the VX precursor chemical Empta (supposedly the smoking
gun that showed up in a "soil sample") was very similar in structure
to "fonofos," an agricultural insecticide, and that these could be
easily confused, particularly in the highly possible scenario of the
"sample's" corruption through improper storage and handling. The
article also goes on to quote an official with the Organization for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague, who said that
research suggests that Empta "could be the byproduct of the breakdown
of other pesticides." And the article concludes with the following
paragraph: "Thomas Carnaffin, a British engineer who worked as a
technical manager during the factory's construction from 1992 to
1996, said he never saw any evidence of Empta or other materials
involved in the production of VX. "I suppose I went into every corner
of the plant,' he said in a telephone interview from his phone in
England. 'It was never a plant of high security. You could walk
around wherever you liked, and no one tried to stop you.'"

Today's lead editorial in the NYT calls on the Clinton administration
to stop being so mysterious about the whole thing. The piece refers
to a rather compelling fact that has been little discussed in the
mainstream media: That the government of Sudan has asked for a United
Nations team of chemical experts to come in, pick through the plant
with a fine-toothed comb, and take all the soil samples they deem
necessary. The United States has refused to cooperate and is blocking
any investigation.

Time will tell, I suppose. But then again, time may not tell, and it
may be that this, like the truth about so many other crimes
committed by our government, will be washed down the drainhole of
history.

Gary --

I'd like to take you up on your challenge to isolate drift -- I'm not sure
close reading will demonstrate it -- what's the story of Ashbery being told
his poems don't make sense, so he says show me where, then he explains all
the references .... somebody said the imperative all americans feel is: not
to be a sucker ... Barnum? or some other epistemologist. But there I go,
buying into that sucker/huckster dichotomy.

I was thinking about the Balkans and Sierra Leone in particular (and Carolyn
Forche's poem was part of the thinking) when I used the word 'amputee.'

I agree with your last paragraph. As to my statement about spin, I stand by
it. Read the whole article. Also note--the story and editorial conclusions
haven't made, as far as I remember, the Washington Post or the LA Times. My
guess is that they're not yet sure it's a story. Important to remember the
NY Times' consistent anti-Clinton stand. But, as you say, time, and more
knowledge, will tell. I, for one, can be patient for a couple of weeks.

Masha Zavialov sent this message me to me a week ago, but I have been away
and can only pass it on now. You may recall that she posted the
information on the immediately forthcoming Russian Poetry festival in St.
Petersburg (Sept. 25-27). (Naturally, one has to wonder how she and other
Russians are faring under the economic chaos of this week, which must be a
terrible one for them.)

Dear Charles
My email was not working for several days - my provider was doing all kinds of
nasty things with my address and now I have a different one:
zavialov@zavialov.spb.ru
I'm afraid that the notice on the festival on the Poetics List has an old
version. Is it possible to change it?
Sorry to give you so much trouble
Best wishes
Masha

College of Neglected Science:  2nd annual RIBOT conference

Paul Vangelisti asked me to post this information about the Ribot (pronounced
ree-boe) conference to celebrate the sixth issue.  I also want to say that
last year's conference on Catalina was a lot of fun.  A lot of wonderful (and
diverse) poets showed up like Norma Cole, Leslie Scalapino, Nathaniel Tarn,
Martha Ronk, Mark Salerno, Todd Barron, Douglas Messerli.  Despite what people
say about the L.A. scene, there are a lot of sharp people in town, more now
than ever, and a lot of momentum building up through this second conference.
I look forward to seeing a large horde of west coast youngsters like myself.
I hear Garrett Caples (showed up last year) and Jeff Clark may attend.  (By
the way, Jeff Clark is definitely not working for the FBI...more likely is
wanted by them) Hopefully we can get Jacques Debrot back out from the Boston
area again this year.  What about you cats in Atlanta?  I hear airlines fares
are reasonable right now.  With Otis College sponsoring the conference this
year, a lot more visual artist are likely to show up.  I hear there'll be some
free booze.

One thing I'm noticing is missing from the following info that Paul sent me is
that there are hotel rooms available for a group rate of $65 a night, free
airport shuttle.

Actually, I have a hardback of On Bear's Head (not handy) and I seem to
remember that the price was $17.95 at a time when most hardcovers were
about a third of that, which would be comparable to a volume of poetry now
going for $60 or so today. I also bought a copy at a Chicago Public
Library sale last week for the tragically low price of 50 cents.

Gary, this is fun.  The question you ask concerning the relevance of critical
discussion to the actual practice/activity of writing poems is a very
important one & I hope that other people will take it up as well -- I just
don't have the time this p.m. to address it with the attention & frankness
that I think  necessary -- but I'm anxious to, as soon as I can break away
from other work.  For now, though, since you brought it up, why don't *you*,
if you like, do a close reading uncovering the Dylan Thomas, Ovid, &
Shakespeare lurking in Stroffolino's poetry & explain to me how these
influences -- the ones you cite in your initial post -- are more (or just as)
urgent & prevelant in S's poetry than Ashbery's.  Can you do it with a
straight face?

Well, I think I can, and will definitely try. I don't have e-mail at home, but
will respond on Monday. But, Jacques, forgive me, I probably wasn't clear: by
"Dylan" I meant Bob Dylan, not Dylan Thomas. Yes, this is fun. But then, my
alternative, here, is (gag me) "work." Which is thankfully over. & this being
Friday night, I'm off to go get twisted.

Soon-soon,

Gary

This question of influence is pretty tricky because it sometimes happens on
so intimate a level that it's unlikely to be noticed by anyone but the
poet. In my own case, for instance (and I cite myself only because I have
more specialized knowledge), I have been very influenced in my sense of the
language's music by, among others, Ben Jonson and Armand Schwerner. Neither
would recognize their voices in my work.

Dear Maria
 I'm sorry you are not coming but I hope that there will be another chance
for you to come. To tell the truth it's not the best time to come as
we are now on the verge of economic collapse. The rouble is falling
drastically and prices are skyrocketing. It's not bad though for
dollar-holders.
 I can't cash my grant that I got from Soros Foundation in August
 for the research in African American and Russian women's literature.
 All bank accounts are almost frozen.
Enclosed please find some additional information on our festival. I
wonder if it's possible to put it on the Poetics list.

  File begins:

Here is some new information for the festival:
The name of the festival is "Genius Loci". The main idea of the festival
is to overcome the split between regional trends and schools (Moscow and
St.Petersburg schools as the main and maybe only ones extant now) in Russian
poetry. This split is not informational but aesthetic. So we strive to
 reestablish poetic continuity, to rehabilitate St. Petersburg poetry in
the eyes of the Moscow public and to shatter the conservatism of the
Petersburg public In other words - to demythologize the images of both.
Our party will include all the active poets of St. Petersburg of various
"denominations": traditionally Peterburgian poets Krivulin and Stratanovsky,
 poets associated with postmodernism A. Dragomoshchenko, Skidan, Golynko,
a poet of "traditional avanguard" Gornon, an old member of Soyuz Pisatelei
but still a very good poet and a young man Nikolai Kononov, a poet of
hermetism Mikhail Eremin, a syllabist Larissa Berezovchuk,  an OBERIUt
Kucheriavkin, and Sergei Zavialov.
You see that "classical" Peterburg poetry with its monotonous rhyming
doesn't dominate the scene.
Moscow people: conceptualists Prigov and Rubinstein, lianozovets Sapgir,
a poet writing in free verse Akhmetyev, performance people Bonifatsii and
Avaliani, young poets Vodennikov, Skorodumova and Zondberg, and also
three well-known guys Aizenberg, Gandlevsky and Aristov.
Of three days in each city there will be two days of readings and one day
(the last one) of discussions and round tables where you are very welcome
to participate
The venue in St.Petersburg is Pushkin's memorial apartment on Moika,12.
End file.
I got an answer from Armand. But I don't have Solomon's address. If you have
it please send it to me. I mean email addr.
Hope to hear from you, Masha

Dear Mr. David:

It is to our delightful attention that the poetry of Sudan is now
discussed in the poetry of America with such suddenness. Thank you
for being a section of this and for making a vision of a poet of
Sudan. In ways I believe you do not suspect, you have entered the
Arab nation's literature. It is my principle, nevertheless, that you
must be delighted by this.

Please excuse my English, but I am writing to invite you, as a
poet first of Canada and now, secondarily, of America, to what I now
wish to present. I am speaking concerning a conference
(International) devotional to translation in all the sense of this
word. We are interested, with specificness, in the doubled (tripled!)
voices passed through many mediators of history and cultural
ignorance. Irony, as I feel you must conceptualize, is big here.
Irony, in its bigness, becomes something other. It is like, for an
example, you, a Sudanese poet speaking through an English tongue of
brokenness. Or it is like many, many things: For an example, if I may
twice say so: It is like two boys kissing in the shadows of a
pharmaceutical plant. (They are like black and deep wells. Their
lives inside are very, very rich.) The sun will come up over this
dusty land and an ancient hatredness shall fill them.

I do not know if I put myself well. So may I directly ask. Will you
come to Khartoum? Please close your heavy eyes and dream of my
branching hand opened out to you.

We passion to invite another poet of America, Mr. Kent, who also is
credenced in your two countries, and perhaps others, to be a racist.
(In his reply to our Central Council, he spoke: "I am honestly not
sure.") Still we are opened, and we have most little, but our flowing
tents which appear (to all purposes and meanings) to be sailboats in
the desert, are yours. Our young are fresh and eager, and they shall
press into your soft mouth goat cheese with a hurt and surprised look
in their eyes. Also, dark-skinned soldiers with golden and musical
watches adorn every minareted corner. Yes, you will find Khartoum
strange and hospitality-filled, except, as you realize, inside
certain surprising circumstances. But lightning on a human is more
likely, so really not to worry.

Ethnography, of course, is also interesting to every one of us and to
all peoples. Our flowing tents, if I may say it repeatedly (for I, in
an addition, am a poet), appear to be sailboats in the desert. Thus,
after the morning session, we will convene in Building 242 for tea,
the prayers of all religions, and the making of bombs. No one is to
be insulted, not even if they do not know how. Then we will
reconvene, as I have said, and talk concerning Ethnography, including
the customs of Christian animists to the south, the poignancy of
American magazines like _Look_and _Cross Cultural Poetics_, and the
rituals of Buffalo List of Poets.

Well, I am sorry. The situation is very complicated. But here, as the
saying goes, we are. Here also, please, is a poem by a youth named
Leonel Rugama whom we have invited too, except sadly he was beheaded
long ago, at 20 years, by Green Beret students in the country of
Nicaragua:

The Earth Is A Satellite Of The Moon

Apollo 2 cost more than Apollo 1
Apollo 1 cost plenty.

Apollo 3 cost more than Apollo 2
Apollo 2 cost more than Apollo 1
Apollo 1 cost plenty.

Apollo 4 cost more than Apollo 3
Apollo 3 cost more than Apollo 2
Apollo 2 cost more than Apollo 1
Apollo 1 cost plenty.

Apollo 8 cost a whole shit-load of money, but no one minded
because the astronauts were Protestant
they read the Bible from the moon
astounding and delighting every Christian
and on their return Pope Paul VI gave them his blessing.

Apollo 9 cost more than all of these put together
including Apollo 1 which cost plenty.

The great-grandparents of the people of Acahualinca were less
           hungry than the grandparents.
The great-grandparents died of hunger.
The grandparents of the people of Acahualinca were less
           hungry than the parents.
The grandparents died of hunger.
The parents of the people of Acahualinca were less
           hungry than the children of the people there.
The parents died of hunger.
The people of Acahualinca are less hungry than the children
           of the people there.
The children of the people of Acahualinca, because of hunger,
           are not born
they hunger to be born, even to just die of hunger.
Blessed are the poor for they shall inherit the moon.
--------------
Well, in realness, I do not know why I give this poem, except that I
know you very much like poems. Don't you agree it was translated,
without doubtfulness, by someone most self-congratulatory, so angry
at his own country, yet blind as Oedipus to the terrorisms of
non-white peoples? (Forgive me. I am smoking opium from Afghanistan.
It betters my English, which you can tell is getting better as
this letter, like a martyr, spills.)

Of course, Mr. David, the trip (including camels) is long, like
torture, apparently, in its likeness, and you shall be compelled to
gift-forth your own plane-fare. In these days, that can be a
dangerous incident. I understand, of course. But we sure hope you
will say yes. Will you say yes? The people of Sudan await you.
Headphones are to be distributed. You are forever one of us.

Sincerely, (although it is not my true name)

Osama Hussein

If Gary is going out,  having published Chris's work for awhile now
including _Oops_ I'll give it a try if no one will hold me accountable
source for source. Though I am a bit elliptical, if something isn't
clear let me know. I'll take the first stanza for two hundred from
"Christmas Card from a landlord" that appears in _Light as a Fetter_ & I
first published in Pavement Saw.


In giddy moods a peach doesn't have to become

Be torn down by plopping another building, ready for

Comes around green again like fool's gold...

Dear Charles
You are right, this country is about to collapse economically. The rouble
has fallen 30% but still foreign currency is nowhere to be got even at a
higher price. I can't cash the check I got as a grant from the Soros
Foundation for the research in Afr. American women's writing.
 In a bank (the main state-owned one) they told me they could
cash it in two months but they didn't advise me to trust them my money.
I guess I'll have to go to Finland to cash it.
The perparation for the festival is going on in spite of all economic
and social upheavals.
Here is some more on the festival. I've sent the same file to Maria Damon.
   Best wishes, Masha





Here is some new information for the festival:
The name of the festival is "Genius Loci". The main idea of the festival
is to overcome the split between regional trends and schools (Moscow and
St.Petersburg schools as the main and maybe only ones extant now) in Russian
poetry. This split is not informational but aesthetic. So we strive to
 reestablish poetic continuity, to rehabilitate St. Petersburg poetry in
the eyes of the Moscow public and to shatter the conservatism of the
Petersburg public In other words - to demythologize the images of both.
Our party will include all the active poets of St. Petersburg of various
"denominations": traditionally Peterburgian poets Krivulin and Stratanovsky,
 poets associated with postmodernism A. Dragomoshchenko, Skidan, Golynko,
a poet of "traditional avanguard" Gornon, an old member of Soyuz Pisatelei
but still a very good poet and a young man Nikolai Kononov, a poet of
hermetism Mikhail Eremin, a syllabist Larissa Berezovchuk,  an OBERIUt
Kucheriavkin, and Sergei Zavialov.
You see that "classical" Peterburg poetry with its monotonous rhyming
doesn't dominate the scene.
Moscow people: conceptualists Prigov and Rubinstein, lianozovets Sapgir,
a poet writing in free verse Akhmetyev, performance people Bonifatsii and
Avaliani, young poets Vodennikov, Skorodumova and Zondberg, and also
three well-known guys Aizenberg, Gandlevsky and Aristov.
Of three days in each city there will be two days of readings and one day
(the last one) of discussions and round tables where you are very welcome
to participate.

the story that whalen told about the origins of On Bears Head was that the
late novelist Don carpenter was signed to harcourt and suggested thatthe
press publish whalen, ron lowensohn, james koller and lew welch. All, but
the Welch book was published (welch did put together a selection that was
done by Don Allen)..if i recall these books were published under a
coyote/harcourt imprint, obviously thiings were loser in the late 60's, as
this is similiarto tom clark gettingharper & row to publish coolidge,
saroyan & (i think) dick gallup and lewis macadams.

apparently lewis warsh and bill berkson were among the picketers at the
harcout offices (the hd was 17.95) amzingly the pb was in print until the
early 80's and then you could get a copy for a buck.

berrigan was not the only whalen booster. warsh wrote an essay on OBH.
waldman interviewed him and he taught at naropa in the early years.
coolidge as well was a big booster.

it would be great if a collected where issued-- maybe too much for a small
press to handle

Wouldn't anything psychoanalytical on sublimation, whereby a certain quality
of pleasure is renounced for another, be helpful? Also Marxism; you mention
Adorno, but Benjamin on distraction, Lukacs on the utility of realism, or
Brecht's aesthetic distancing as a shift of quality of pleasure for political
purposes might be worth thinking about.

     A poem's status as 'text' is an intriguing concept when 'text' is
"actual words of an author as opposed to notes" (_Websters') or "the
principal matter on a printed page" (Webster's again) and this 'text' is
posted for people to 'read' through a wide range of browsers.  Is it
'printed as text" when posted or when read?  I think there is more to
this question than just a virtual conumdrum.

My experience in working with poetry as image is that rather than taking
from my work I am adding to it through the drawing mode. [I hope this is
shared by readers].  the verbal and visual come from differnt places in
my body and meet (hopefully) out there someplace (playspace, meditation
site, etc.).  Hard to keep from getting carried away here, but recent
mentions of Whalen on the list here is possibly serendipitous?

Oh, an addendum. I think Benjamin's conception of "sobriety" in his essay, "On
the Concept of Criticism in Early German Romanticism" could be helpful. Also,
in the Kantian vein, Schiller's ofen overlooked essay on the sublime might
interest you.

Dear Friends:

At the risk of preaching to the choir, I'd like to second a statement
made by my colleague, Standard Schaefer, in his announcement of the
Ribot Conference, to wit:

P.Standard Schaefer wrote:
>
> Despite what people
> say about the L.A. scene, there are a lot of sharp people in town, more now
> than ever, and a lot of momentum building up through this second conference.

It amazes me that, among seemingly "sharp" people in other parts of the
world, Los Angeles as a cultural and arts center is still held in low
esteem, if not in contempt. For example, when I was in New York last
spring, to read at St. Mark's and the Zinc Bar, and to see friends and
fellow poets, I was often met with the question: "Is there any poetry
scene in L.A.?" This question was sometimes accompanied by derisive
jokes about Los Angeles cultural life, or lack thereof, jokes that dated
back to the pre-ANNIE HALL movies of Woody Allen. I was disappointed, to
say the least. It seems like the height of provincialism to have no
interest in or understanding of places outside one's own, and I had
expected a little better of New York.

The fact is that Los Angeles has a pretty dynamic and varied poetry
scene, one that remains open to new things and to experiment on all
levels. The upside of the famous "slam" against L.A., that it is too
spread out, is that there's plenty of room--intellectual and
psychological, as well as geographical--for everyone and anyone to do as
they please. Furthermore, Standard's point is not just that there is
activity here, but that there is quality as well. One need look no
further than Standard's own RHIZOME magazine, which I think in terms of
its quality stands up against anything of its kind published anywhere
else in the U.S. And RHIZOME represents but a small segment of the kinds
of things being produced in Los Angeles. Paul Vangelisti's RIBOT, and
the conferences that are growing out of it, are also sources of quality
material and gathering energy. And it hardly needs to be stated that
Douglas Messerli's Sun & Moon Press is arguably the premier small press
in North America--and, folks, its offices are down on the famous and
beautiful Wilshire Boulevard!

While I dislike being in the position of having to defend Los Angeles,
or of sounding booster-ish, I must say it really doesn't reflect well on
us as poets and artists if we continue to fall back on received opinions
(not to say cliches) and fail to allow our curiosity to lead us to
investigate what is really what. Even if we are *only* talking about Los
Angeles.

Good wishes & Join Us for the Ribot Conference,

Mark Salerno

P.S. I'm a New Yorker born and raised, living in Los Angeles for a
decade and a half, so I'm not exactly unsympathetic to both sides of the
issue.

I enjoyed Jacques D's post on Ashbery, despite finding myself in the "wrong"
camp of Ashbery camp followers.  What struck me, however, was that the terms
by which the _New Criterion_ decided what JA was acceptable and what not were
simply reversed, so that what the NC didn't like acquired value and what they
approved of seemed troublesome to JD.  Surely there are a myriad--a plethora,
even--of positions somewhere else on this right to left (or
meditative/Romantic to O'Hara) spectrum.  To categorize JA as an either-or
seems to me, in any case, to go against the terms that JA sets up (though I
admire the way Debrot worked this particular kind of argument).  What strikes
me as most troublesome about Ashbery is not that there is more than one of
him--hence many possible variations on his themes by younger poets, but that
it's impossible on some level to make the choice.  His consistency is his
inconsistency.  It's something that makes it difficult to write about his
work, seems to me.
That said, I think there remains a lot of work to do within the larger
influence that Ashbery is, and one of these tasks is to anchor his marvelous
process of process in the actual, political, multicultural world.  One can
make the argument that he already does this (as Stephen Paul Martin did in a
book I edited), but I think one can expand upon this strain (and perhaps it
_is_ a strain) in JA's work.  That is what I see myself trying to do, whether
or not the _Talisman_ bears witness to it.
And that said, I'd happily pay my money again for _Wakefulness_, if only to
read the lines in the first poem about "A kindly gnome / of fear [that]
perched on my dashboard once."  I knew that gnome, I was friends with that
gnome, and Dan Quayle, you have no gnome.

all the best, Susan Schultz

     It's great to see Leonel Rugama's name and work in print anywhere.
     Surrounded in a home by the army of Somoza, Rugama, a young poet and
     Sandinista, was called on to surrender. His comrades dead beside him
     and the house in flames, Rugama yelled back, "Ask your mother to

My question is what does "metonymic" mean here?  I'm baffled or am I
just in an end of summer heatwave funk/

Dear List-lings:

I was in Asheville (NC) a couple of months ago, and stumbled across
a couple of excellent used/rare bookstores.  Among other things, I
picked up two Jargon books by Thomas Meyer:  THE BANG BOOK (Jargon
69, 1071 - A tale of the Old West), and SAPPHO'S RAFT (Jargon 99,
1982).  As expected, these are gorgeous books.  Can anyone help me
out:  who is/was Thomas Meyer?

And, on Jargon books, another request for help (back-channel, I
suppose):  can anyone help me locate (for purchase) an affordable
copy of Larry Eigner's ON MY EYES (Jargon 36, 1960)?

I've seen bits and pieces of this book--there is a good selection in
Larry's SELECTED POEMS--and I'm becoming convinced that this book is
a neglected masterpiece.  I've located one copy for sale, but at $250
it's way out of my league.  Any help finding an affordable copy would
be appreciated.

have you called Woodland Patterns in Milwaukee?  They are amazing for
having stocked a tremendous amount of small press when it came out & a
lot still remains in stock, not having sold for all these years, & the
prices are often the original.  for instance, Ive been able to pick up
bob cobbing writer forum books for a couple dollars.  worth a try, dont
have their phone in front of me but could dig it up if need be.

Hank: Tom Meyer is one of the best-hidden secrets of US poetry. I met him i=
n
the late sixties when we were undergraduates at Bard College, & Tom very
much enthralled with Robert Kelly ('s work). I, young rimbaldian  european
always down at Adolf's bar trying to dis-adjust my d=E9r=E8glement of all the
senses, was amazed at Tom's absolute seriousness as a poet even then: he
would write solidly a number of hours a day,  working on a long, long work
(never published as such, though a few excerpts did appear in mags) called,
if memory serves, _A Typographical(?) Typography in Progress_. Meeting Basi=
l
Bunting soon after the dogdays of the Bardo Thodol, got him to trim the wor=
k
to a perfect lyric: his ear is one of the very best I have encountered. His
choice to publish (nearly exclusively) with Jargon Press (he & Jonathan
Williams have been companions for many years)  has meant a number of lovely=
,
and lovingly produced but rather well-hidden books over the last 25 years =8B
besides those you mention, try to get ahold of _Staves Calends Legends_ and
_The Umbrellas of Aesculapius_, both also from Jargon. Also, from St Lazair=
e
Press, _Tom Writes This For Robert To Read_  (I still have a few copies of
that, shld you/anyone be interested.) Last time I talked to him he was
working on an opera libretto. Meyer is a tremendous poet whose work deserve=
s
to be much, much better known =8B though maybe Tom himself  would prefer his
readers to discover his work the way you just did =8B=A0& wld excoriate this my

My feelings are that in the near future (if not already) it doesn't matter
if poetics exist here or there - due to the magnificant power of the
computer.  The internet has pretty much destroyed geography boundries - for
those who have it of course.  Perhaps it is a matter of time (perhaps
seconds) where all cities can be hooked up.

I don't think it will be a matter of major or 'minor' cities.  I think the
difference will be deleted.  Although I don't understand what it means to
(for a city) 'be held in contempt.'

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

        Dear me Mr.Kent, how can I thank you for your inviting letter.
Inasmuch as it was a response to my dramatic catalog, "Brainwashed Sudanese
Poet," let me move rapidly to make you sure it was really not much about my
ignorance of my home land nearly so much as it was about bad writing. The
eponymous person was born of that phrase, nothing more or less than what
the Dr.Griemass has called an _actant_ , for the phrase that it was born of
was driving the camels of my mind from the tents of my soul, if I may to
place it in your language. Only to sit, take up dried-dung stick, indite,
relieved.

Some lesser-sized hope beat in my br, er, breasts, that the easy ironies of
those wielding it shall lessen their accessibilities. Are you Mr.Kent
author of poem concluding the poor live on the moon as of the Double
Flowering poet with the name difficult to us of my country? I am holding
converse with your sister-in-law at the local well and it is of our
children we speak, and our writings. How sad if our children are being
exploded or even inured with Crude missiles! Then is one likely to come off
it tone-wise, and injure our art with longings. My indignation has rocks in
its mouth to please an old Greek. I am being compared to a Brit if you
please. Are you terrorista ?

But to me it is seeming badwriting has some approach hopefulness to
surviving language through cliche war for the words sentenced to death. It
is like the straw camel that hides the active participant. Are you able to
think like I or do we have to kill one another, and all the shades of gray
from cat to camel in between, there, there is our topos. I am soon to learn
the employment of exclamation marks, those punctiliousnesses that resemble
falling bombs, and might well be appended to the exclaims of those agonized
thereof. Secondarily, as you write, byproducts of badwriting entail minute
examinations of how one is spelling his writing, so as better to make
certain all mistakes are intentional in the eye of the reader (his other
eye lost for the underdeclared war).

Because all this is exemplary, Mr. Kent (may I be calling you Clark?), we
would like you to be head of conference on badwriting to be held at an
authentic address, For-a-Song Sheet, Nowhere, Before Christ, The World, The
Universe. Little pains will be lost to render you hospitable in our
entertainments. I do not myself look forward to the time when I master
better the English tongue and write like everybody else. But it must come
to all us, in our obscureness. Again, I am of no nation except it be
textual. I am like the poor living on the moon, full of moonshine. America,
however, is full of blades of glass. Davood.

i am catching up on back messages but, i would suggest walter Ong.

right now i am trying to messure the distance between ong's theories of
"primary oral culture" and j. rothenburg's work in "technicians of the
sacred"

this may be a little front channel for you all but advice and suggestions
always welcome through the back


ps. i'm sure there are spelling errors all the way through.

Hank,

Tom Meyer is the significant other in Jonathon Williams life, having been
such since 27 September 1968 (happy 30th, guys!) as well as a fine lyric
poet in his own right. That date is established by the footnote to the
"Classified Advertisement" at the end of _The Loco Logodaedalist in Situ_
(Cape Goliard/Grossman).

Tom was a student of Robert Kelly's at Bard when I first met him, which was
maybe two years before that. One of his early writing projects (long since
abandoned) was called a _Technographic Typography_ an endless poem that was
several hundred pages by the time Tom was 20 or thereabouts. It was an
attempt to include everything and the idea behind has stuck in _my_ head
ever since. A Fragment of Graph 42 appeared in the fourth issue of Tottel's,
July 1971. (There were other Kelly students,John Gorham and David Kelly, in
those early issues, in addition to Robert himself and several compadres like
Irby, Marlatt and Rothenberg, tho the first "single person" issue, #3, was
for Rae Armantrout, and the first person in the first issue was David
Bromige--as you can see my editorial instincts have been somewhat constant
over the years.)

Tom's published several books over the years, but living away from the major
cities has I think made him far less well known than he deserves to be.

Thanks to Ron, Keith, Pierre, and Bill for the generous, helpful
information on Tom Meyer.  Yet another in the too long list of
excellent neglected poets of our time....  In that vein, my personal
hobbyhorse these days is Ted Enslin--I think Ted has as fine an ear,
as interesting a musicality as anyone writing today.  Mark Nowak has
edited Ted's Selected Poems (which Burt Hatlen swears the National
Poetry Foundation will publish this Fall).  Those on the West Coast
will have a chance to hear Ted read this October.  I don't know
precise dates and details of his West Coast reading tour.  Perhaps
Dodie may know?  Not to be be missed.

As for those hard to find Jargon books, I still have no (affordable)
leads on Larry Eigner's ON MY EYES.  As you scour used bookstores,
please keep me in mind & backchannel if you stumble across a copy.
Thanks.

He is a mystery novelist who writes, to my mind, like a cross between

Subject:      mapping the Ashbery influence
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        I've been following the exchange between Jacques and Gary (and now
Susan) with a lot of interest. While I agree that it's not so easy to
separate what constitutes an 'academic' from a 'poetic' move (much less a
'critical' from a 'poetic' one) I think I see in Gary's post a much more
serious undercurrent than simply the idea that to categorize is to
academize, and I'm glad he's taken it on.

        The point I'd like to suggest is that while categorization of some
kind is going on in any kind of critical distinction (and that most of us
are making such distinctions all the time), the issue has to do not only
with questioning how the categories are constructed, but also with the
implications
they have for the issue of resources in the publishing world, who gets
them and why. So the problem is not simply categorization, but the places
and ways in which these categorizations get taken to be AUTHORITATIVE
categorizations, and by who, and what happens when they get taken as
authoritative. One of Gary's concerns, re the Talisman anthology for
instance, is that the anthology, because it calls itself an anthology and
because of the WAY that it calls itself an anthology, will be seen as an
authoritative decision of whose work is worthy of further attention, when
of course it represents nothing more (and nothing less!) than the
decisions that Lisa, Leonard, and Chris made together or
semi-together about the poets whose work they wanted to feature.

        I don't mind Jacques' characterizations very much (even though I
don't entirely buy them) simply because he, and the context, make it
perfectly clear that his argument is simply his attempt at categorizing a
context, no more or less than that, although I suppose I'd find it
troubling if I thought that Jacques was unconsciously accepting some sort
of external opinion as authoritative, which I don't really think he IS
doing. We'd have to discuss next, I suppose, the extent to which a New
York Times article is taken (and by who) to be authoritative, and the
extent to which an anthology is taken (and by who) to be authoritative. I
agree absolutely with Gary that the Talisman anthology should have no more
authority, say, than any other issue of the Talisman magazine--although I
bet the anthology gets stocked in more stores simply and only because it
labels itself an anthology. And I don't doubt for a second that Ed
Foster, who puts a tremendous amount of labor into Talisman, knew that
calling it an anthology might help it sell more copies, because he's
obviously got to sell some of these books somehow if he's going to stay
in business. And I for one WANT him to stay in business. But then I'd want
to go even further and say that the Poems from the Millenium anthology, or
the Norton anthologies, are themselves no more authoritative than
than the Talisman anthology, while at the same time I KNOW they are taken
as such in most academic and publishing contexts. Given the current state
of the publishing industry (and the extent to which the American
population takes the pronouncements of business AS authority), the
question becomes not how to avoid authority and its potential misuse
(which we're not going to be able to) but how to DEAL with it.

        The problem then is one of authority as it is reflected by the
process of categorization. Being in the Norton
anthology probably means very little relative to the quality of one's work
(and "quality" itself will obviously fall apart on ideological grounds),
but if you're alive, you can be certain that being in Norton means
potentiallly a lot in terms of resources for your work, chances for
exposure, who will publish you, etc. Do such things matter to the creation
of poetry? Whether or not they seriously impact one's ability to write
(and some would insist they do and others insist they don't) they
CERTAINLY impact how influence is perceived. And they certainly influence
HOW one is influenced, since you can't be influenced by what you don't
know exists.

        So, is John Ashbery "influential" because many younger writers
have been influenced by him? Have they been influenced by him because it's
easier to find out about him than, say, Tom Raworth, whose work has
greatly influenced me (as has the work of many other writers)? Do they
simply APPEAR to be influenced by Ashbery because other equally strong
influences are harder to locate in
people's writing? While all of the above seem possible for differing
writers, the question I'd still want to ask is to what extent does the
power of publishing itself help CREATE the Ashbery dynamic. Or put it this
way: as poets we may have a great deal of power to choose our influences,
but one of those influences is going to be the power of publishing
resources to enable the idea of central influences. And this problem
requires us to examine very closely how the publishing industry does
enable this idea of central influences, and how we can either choose to
accept or resist the dynamics that it puts in play.

        The recent 100 best books list, for instance, was a business SCAM;
but even as such, it's reached vastly more people, sadly, than anything
Gary or Jacques have said.

THE STORY OF THE HOLOGIES

Once upon a pond there was a little family of frogs called the Hologies.
There was Aunt Hology and Uncle Hology and lots of lil Hologies called
Diurnal Kid Hologies.  They were a big happy bunch of yappers indeed,
until one day Aunt Hology said to Uncle Hology: "Why Unkie, is
there anyone outside the pond that even knows we exist?  Huh?"
Uncle Hology scratched his left apology & said: "Why Auntie, I just
don't know!  Let's build a big pond-pole & look way out yonder & see
if anybody sees or knows us!"

So Aunt Hology & Uncle Hology & all the Diurnal Kid Hologies began
to gather suet & phone books at the center of the pond.  They were
a darn clever bunch of Hologies indeed!  They piled up the phone books
& held them together with suet, wouldn't you know!  Until they made
a pond pole that almost reached up to a low-flying stealth crow named
Biff (more about him in another book, kids!).  Auntie Hology said to
Unkie Hology: "Gee, Unkie, that's a tall pole!  Are you going to climb
that yourself?"  Unkie scratched his right apology & said, "Why no - I'm
too big & heavy!  I'll send up little Nippy Hology, our favorite kid!"
So good little Nippy started to climb.  He climbed & climbed and climbed
and climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed and so on and climbed and
climbed and climbed and climbed some more and climbed and climbed, to
the very top of that pond pole, until Aunt Hology & Uncle Hology couldn't
even see him anymore!  Unk Hology shouted up - "Nippy!  Can you see anything?"
No reply.  "Nippy, you up there?"  No reply.  Uncle & Auntie Hology were
beginning to get concerned about little Nippy when suddenly who did they
see but Biff the stealth crow, holding Nippy by his shirt collar in his
big black beak & flapping off toward the southwest!

Thanks to Mark Wallace for a very incisive and rich set of reflections,
spinning off the Ashbery etc thread....

I would like to carry further some of his thoughts on publishing and the
institutional context of poetry.

First, i've just finished reading Poet Be Like God...I believe that
Ellingham and Killian deserve a big-time ovation for a brilliant book, a
book that is *useful* and informative, as well as thoughtful about a lot
of the issues brought up by Jack Spicer's work and career.  (Fun to read,
too)

It is some of those issues, that i think link up with point Mark W. has
just been making.

One of the most striking things about Spicer's life and career, which i
think will in many ways grow in importance in time to come (as will the
influence and ubiquity of his work) is his insistence on poetry and poetix
as being constituted by the shared projects of a community.  In a way, he
almost completely dissolved for his own world the distinction between "the
audience" and "the poets", replacing it with a more demanding and fierce
idea, of a community to which people had a commitment.  Thus his
(seemingly bizarre) insistence that magazines and publishing projects with
which he was associated, and his own published works, not be distributed
outside the Bay Area.  This gets into many other odd directions, such as
his angry belief that Duncan had "sold out" for money, because of having
national acclaim of a sort and nationally-distributed books. (i found this
part especially bemusing, as one can just imagine what "big bucks" RD was
getting from his New Directions sales in the first few years of the '60s!)

The point is, that there are ways of thinking about the ongoing activities
of poetry, which confront the extremely corrupt nexus of
publishing-academe-middlebrow PR that seems so hopeless and destructive to
me. I don't advocate folks refusing to publish or distribute outside their
own city; but i take Spicer's deliberately "quixotic" approach as a kind
of challenge and inspiration.  Many of the most vital ongoing approaches
to poetry distribution/reception/support right now, have some of the same
insistence on the guerilla dimensions of liliputian resistence/lilliputian
creativity.  Small xeroxial mags and similar "fugitive" forms; a strong
emphasis in some cities on local exchange of work and readings and
discussion meetings; the highly creative and beautiful work the small
presses have been doing.  There are even several quasi-magazines,
distributed only to their contributors, which are a sort of
workshop/collective space, for poets who share similar interests and
directions.  This latter phenomenon seems to be consciously based on the
Spicer circle's Open Space project.

I believe that even the emergence of a really fine poet *who has no body
or legal biographical existence* (Araki Yasusada) is in part one form of
resistence to contemporary publishing/careerism patterns.  In this
respect, Yasusada's ghostly career shares certain dynamix with the
striking emergence (in the last 15 years) of *collaboration* as a major
mode of poetic activity in the U.S.  This also is a way in which the work
is given its own right to live, within a self-evolving community; like
Yasusada, creating and publishing collaborative work turns the attention
away from a fetishized Poet as celebrity/personality; and like Spicer's
mad imaginings, it foregrounds poetic community within an ideal of
fiercely-committed collective practice.

Love that Pepsi cap game!

But Mark, do you really only write for the community of poets? Even if that
would work with Tim Davis's rewrite of Stein ("I write for myself and
strangeness" -- or maybe Tim stole someone else's rewrite?), wouldn't you
want to get out some time? Talk to other people, have other people listen to
you?

I don't think democracy is especially well-served by communities breaking
down into hermetic units, actually. You need news, from here and abroad (and
I'm not _only_ speaking about genetics).

If you take a look at the influence Duncan, Spicer and others have had,
you'll see the fallacy of your way of putting it...

To challenge through alternative structure *need not* be "breaking down
into hermetic units"....

My apologies for the "strangeness" of my reply to Mark -- aside to Todd, the
Self is very important for accountability and apology, no? --

it is an unsettled issue, what genetics would have to do with poetry --

in the context of Duncan's and Spicer's ideas of community it must have
sounded like a threateningly heterosexist remark --

it's just that "unacceptable" O'Hara in me (winking so hard I look weird),
making me think that a community is always involved with the communities
around it whether or not it makes any sense or does anybody any good -- but
then my name ain't Francis --

And given everything, why not say everything, include everything? There is no

Following recent posts by Mark, Mark, Gary, Jordan, et al...

Can a poet control who is reading him or her and how? It seems to me that
the issue of the poet constructing a career or anti-career in a
self-conscious way becomes important because it gives the illusion that
the poet is in control of a process of reception that is actually
uncontrollable. There is the "coterie" poet, given a positive meaning in
Spicer.  There is the O'Hara model of casual indifference (or pretence
of).  Then there is Berrigan's approach, seen in the poem "Something
amazing just happened,"  in which he recounts a dream:  "Mr. Berrigan, he
says, & without waiting for an answer goes on, / I'm happy to be able to
inform you that your request for a Guggenheim Foundation Grant / Has been
favorably received by the committee, & approved.  When would you like to
leave?"

I don't mean to stigmatize or ridicule any of these approaches to
"career," (or negation thereof) just to suggest that they are all
responses to the same impossible situation. Celan suggested the poem was a
"message in a bottle."

Making poetry is always an address to an audience, a conversation - at the
same time it is a process of the individual separating out from group
ways of responding & cliches - at the same time it is a response to the
models & heroes of tradition.  So it is action at a distance in the quantum
sense as well as a present, contemporary predicament.  This DOES seem
like an impossible, contradictory situation, until you remember that
the reason people start making art in the 1st place is that it seems
a process of tapping into a living energy - a vitality that makes the
distinctions of past & present, near & distant, seem less absolute.
There is this uncanny aspect of revitalizing dead voices & past or
distant traditions - the model is resurrection - everything brought
into the present in some way - the present of the poem...

so tendencies leaning toward pure careerism or pure technique or
pure antiquarianism seem more like weaknesses than strengths in the
long run -

Celan's "message in a bottle" aphorism came from Mandelstam, most
probably (see M's essay "On the Interlocutor"). Celan also has this
curious approach (in his hard-to-follow prose) to the poet as
anti- or post-artist - this may relate to the "vatic / craftsperson"
continuum; we look to poetry not only for poetry-in-itself but for
the poet who absorbs all existence - cosmic, historical, moral -
& turns it into poetry - this again is that uncanny aspect, of art
transcending itself (via experience & humility) - & it doesn't have
to be a grandiose thing - but integral to the poem's stance & voice(s) -

Seattle Police responded yesterday in the early morning hours to a
complaint that a man was attempting to use a rubber hose to siphon and
steal
gasoline from an RV parked downtown.  Police arrived on the scene to
find
the man curled up on the ground vomiting profusely.   Evidently there
were several
tank outlets on the RV and the man had inadvertantly hooked his siphon
hose up to the sewage tank of the RV.   The owner, who was asleep inside
at
the time and woken up by the ruckus, refused to press any charges
stating
that it was absolutely the best laugh he had ever had in his life.

In regard to the often cloying obligato about "web communities,"
e-communities etc etc, the AP proffers teh following:

"The more hours people spend on the Internet, the more depressed, stressed
and lonely they feel, according to a groundbreaking study that surprised
its authors.

Internet use had the same effect even for people who spent most of their
time in such social activiites as chat rooms or exchanging e-mail, said
the study headed by Robert Kraut, a social psychology professor at
Carnegie Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh.

Sociable users end up feeling just as isolated as users who spent more
time crawling the Web for information, Kraut said Sunday.

One reason for the negative effect might have been that using the Internet
left less time for the deeper relationships of friends and family, Kraut
suggested.

'People are substituting weaker social ties for stronger ones,' he said.
'They're substituting conversations on narrower topics with strangers for
conversations with people who are connected to their life.'

It was the first study to examine the emotional impact of people's
Internet use over time, Kraut said.

The findings contradicted the researchers' expectations."

As a veteran reader of social science research I'm always a little
sceptical, and only a reading of the protocols for the study would answer
my specific concerns. A favorite of mine was a study that purported to find
that epileptics are stranger than other people even between seizures. The
researcher suggested in his conclusion that there might be undetected
brain-wave abnormalities present. Of course, despite the well-known side
effects of most anti-spasmodics he didn't differentiate in his tiny sample
between those on medication and those not. Nor did he take into account the
impact of the stress caused by the expectation of seizures or the prejudice
against people who sometimes demonstrate showy symptoms in public.
Then there's the one I'm sure everyone on the list remembers that purported
to demonstrate that if you went to the writing program at Iowa you were in
danger of becoming manic-depressive, or the recent one that claimed that
younger siblings are more likely to be revolutionaries than the eldest child.
Here, it would be nice to know how depression was diagnosed, how the
control group was constituted, and if, perhaps, more depressed people with
fewer social ties were more likely to resort to the internet. In other
words, did the internet make them depressed or did depression make them log
on? Kind of like asking if coughing causes TB or the other way around. But
Professor Kraut probably got tenure for this one.

This takes us back to location:  the internet as location rather than
activity/passivity. Where are we when we are here? I think Alan Sondheim's work
is situated somewhat in this "site." It's a pretty new "place" and that may be
what makes his work difficult to many of us?

Nothing wrong with depression, either,

The influence of Western Idealism on aesthetics is a big part of the
problem. As a theory of pure mind, Idealism renounces the body as a corrupt
and vulgar source of information/truth. Hence, the renouncing of pleasure
as part of the aesthetic. Kantian aesthetics do not renounce pleasure,
though. In the Analytic of the Beautiful that's all Kant talks about.

Metonymic, as Lacan used it in relation to desire, could mean 'serial'.
Lacan proposed that desire proliferated in "metonymic chains", series of
objects related contiguously rather than essentially.

Dear Mr. Davood:

Please excuse me for writing wrongly your name. Perhaps I could
repent it was my spell-check. But sadly, thus, it is my dwelling in
circles beneath your demonstrations of methods. Oh, do not think it
is easy to say this, nor is it to shovel toward the upward, I think.
No, sirree. Indignation has rocks in its mouth to please a Greek.
Here in Sudan, children suck on them. Please excuse my bad writing.

In any cases, of course the truly poor live on the moon, Mr. Davood.
Do you doubt it? They build their writing huts, especially and
charmingly, in craters dug by exploded children. I know, of
course, that some of the poor live also in Sebastopolo, but these
would be, of the foreground, poor people of working kind, not like
many other people living in Sebastopolo, some of which, my own blood
tells me (my brother, that is), have on villa walls pretty
blades of glass. "Well, ha, ha, privilege is the hothouse for irony,"
murmur Saudi caddies, their hair piled high like dark embassies.
Consequently, thank God for this and for all of the things in the
kingdom. Otherwise, where in the desert is laughter?(!)

(Immediately I wish to plainly say: Please do not think me
double-faced, for I cannot utter a lie: I, most like you, yet like
many, have inherited a fortune from a chemical future. And perhaps,
yes, a forked tongue is like a forking path. No difference what you
take, you come sighing to one place. I'll bet not, but here I must
say, OK, anyway, my logic has an apparition of breaking down.)

Therefore, if I may interrupt my caravan of thinking with the
allusions as they exist to ask the following: Please say best wishes
to my sister-in-law at the health-spa. Thank you.

Also, because my passion-point is translation (please remember this),
here is a poem for machista men (erotic) by a man named Roque Dalton
of the country of El Salvador. He was not killed by students of Green
Beret, but by fellow-believers, at 40 years, in one Byzantium
power struggle inside the terrorist circle:

Toward A Better Love

No one disputes that sex
is a condition in the world of the couple:
from there, tenderness and its wild branches.

No one disputes that sex
is a domestic condition:
from there, kids,
nights in common
and days divided
(he looking for bread in the street,
in offices or factories;
she in the rear-guard of domestic functions,
in the strategy and tactic of the kitchen
that allows survival in a common struggle
at least to the end of the month).

No one disputes that sex
is an economic condition:
it's enough to mention prostitution,
fashion,
the sections in the dailies that are only for her
or only for him.

Where the hassles begin
is when a woman says
sex is a political condition.

Because when a woman says
sex is a political condition
she can begin to stop being a woman in herself
in order to become a woman for herself, establishing the woman in
woman
from the basis of her humanity
and not of her sex,
knowing that the magic deodorant with a hint of lemon
and soap that voluptuously caresses her skin
are made by the same corporation that makes napalm
knowing the labors of the home themselves
are labors of a social class to which that home belongs,
that the difference between the sexes
burns much better in the loving depth of night
when al those secrets that kept us
masked and alien are revealed.

------------------
Needlessly to say to you, this poem would be totally banned by the
Taliban. So no, no, we do not have to kill each other. But probably,
as humans, we desire to. And our wandering letters, a thousand nights
from now and one, shall be wondered about by initiates in the poesies
of terrorism. If you will not doubt this, neither will I. In a
direction of English speaking, therefore, why don't we just kill each
other, baby? Like Arab-dubbed Wheel of Fortune, it shall be
hand-clapping time.

Still, without a chuckle, we should be friends, and you may be right:
It is always one danger in this that bad writing, like a name, will
hide behind itself. Perhaps I do this and perhaps not. Or perhaps
sometimes I do this and sometimes not. Or perhaps I always do this
and wish it were not. Or perhaps I usually never do this and wish it
were so. Oh, wrap your night-sheathed arms around this paunchy belly,
Mr. Davood, and ride with me. We may die of thirst, but together we
must mark all the mirages as one, and thus on. Am I speaking in any
sense to you?

And if you wish to call me in my ear Mr. Kent, very well then, you
may call me Mr. Kent. But only for the clicking sound that you love.

For now we are inside a certain thing. A camel has been kicked. Will
you come to Khartoum?
