Hi Patrick,

Great post.  You write: "Frankly stated, uninformed or poorly informed
people invented these promises you name out of thin air without heed to the
medium and its ontogeny."

I think there were some better informed people out there, notably George
Landow, but that being informed didn't necessarily help.  In any case, I
thought I'd paste in below the footnote from my essay of footnotes, "Stops
and Rebels: a critique of hypertext" which is at ubu.com but which nobody
ever read (which was sort of the point -- too many links!) [it could just be
stinky, of course] which deals with Landow.  For some reason the spacing
between some of the words got deleted when it went live, but it's readable
(some spelling errors).  It's a big stream of nay-saying, doesn't suggest
positive qualities, but this was 1995 and at that time I hadn't even seen
the internet (though I had been programming computers).  I'd write more
about your own post but I'm at work, hence the pre-chewed slab.

George P. Landow, in his book Hypertext (Maryland: Johns Hopkins University
Press, 1992),describes, in a thorough and "theoretical" though mostly
uncritical fashion, the role thatinterlinked texts in computers can play,
and are playing, in ways that have changed the generalunderstanding of the
autonomy of texts and the closed linearity of the narrative universe,
alongwith the role that the visual image adopt presented with text.  He
links these various newconcepts to much theory by such writers as Derrida
and Bakhtin, thus demonstrating thatcomputers have fulfilled many
"prophecies" by theorists, offering, thus, the hard evidence of theefficacy
of the ideas themselves.  His book, much of which is based on his own actual
experiencewith hypertext, is interesting but highly problematic, and finally
adds up, in my opinion, to manynon-conclusions, Landow having built them
upon some poor rationalization.  While I can't, here,reiterate all of the
arguments in his book, a few are worth investigating.  Landow's conception
ofhypertext, for example, seems to equate the mere juxtaposition of two
texts as an act ofcollaboration between the respective authors, something
which he feels can only occur in"cyberspace" and not in, say, the
well-stocked library of an academician or bibliophile.  Hewrites: "By
emphasizingthe presence of other texts and their cooperative interaction,
networkedhypertext makes all additions to a system simultaneously a matter
of versioning and of theassembly-line model.  Once ensconced within a
network of electronic links, a document nolonger exists by itself.  It
always exists in relation to other documents in a way that a book orprinted
document never does and never can.  From this crucial shift in the way texts
exist inrelation to others derive two principles that, in turn, produce this
fourth form of collaboration:first, any document placed on any networked
system that supports electronically linked materialspotentially exists in
collaboration with any and all other documents on that system; second,
anydocument electronically linked to any other document collaborates with
it." (p.88, italics mine) One is unclear, reading this, of the exact
difference between, say, copying several paragraphsfrom a book in a library
and taking them home, and cut-and-pasting them from an intermediasystem; he
assumes a metaphysic that grants some sort of ubiquity to a computerized
text that hedoesn't believe occurs with books, and that texts, once they
have entered cyberspace, partake ofthis ubiquity, so that once they meet in
an interlinked situation, they have already "scoped eachother out" and need
no further introduction.  It is worth noting that he switches from terms
like"emphasize" (comparative) and "potentially" to terms that suggest total
(superlative) andinevitable transformations of understanding.  With such
logic, a visit to the zoo, with itsjuxtapositions that cannot and never can
occur in "nature," permenantly, completely, andinevitably impresses upon the
mind the interconnectivity (and chaos) of all animal and vegatablelife,
which is usually not the case - one discovers, rather, the sad logic of
cages and feedingschedules, not to mention budgets and the fickleness of
idle curiousity.  Landow also ignores, orfails to bemoan, the
decontextualization that occurs when an excerpt is ripped from its
originalbinding, as if reading were merely (as many academicians believe)
the accumulation of catchphrases and marketable concepts, without the
totality of a unifying, signature scheme to resistsuch poor digestion.
There may be relevance in Landow's arguments in terms of the use ofvisual
images, but photography and film, and before that printing, were the real
revolutionaryforces in the use of images to support texts (though I do,
myself, plan on using images,photographic and kinetic, in computerized
poems, and possibly on the Internet).  The field, orlocus, of intermedia, as
Landow notes here but often forgets, is only one of potential; it is not
aplace where connections are automatically made (such automation requires
biases, anyway, andis not worth lauding), and will not make individuals any
better at synthesizinginformation anddrawing conclusions.  In fact, it may
make them worse, since information is invariably leveledwhen appropriated
for the computer, such that a video description of a waterfall, or a walk
downJohn Rechy's Broadway, or the sound of William Carlos Williams' voice,
are put on an equalplain, with an equal degree of accessibility (to two
senses, with a limited range of height andvolume) and vulnerability (the
same that any textual sign can suffer, that of disbelief), such
thataccidents of persception will occur less frequently than "in the field."
In this way, users ofhypertext interlinks may come to not know their own
ignorance - the age-old problem of bookworms. There is also the assumption
that anyone, of any type of psychology and background, canunderstand and
appreciate this information, as if the addition of sound and color - but
with thenotable absence of a director/ editor, an organizing sensibility -
will make the Korean War, or acholera plague, a more "lived" and
academically useful category of information.  This sort ofleveling could
not, for example, lead to a multi-dimensional poetics of understanding like
that ofBlake's (to use an odd, but "charged," example), for it
short-circuits, in obvious ways, the sort ofcorporeal, visceral
understanding necessary for the prophetic works and the fluid
psychologicaldynamics inscribed in them.  Consequently, hypertext only
serves to reinscribe (Lockean)binaries - or a primary binary - that Landow
professes to have been dissolved, for the experienceof this information is
always along the same axis of I/computer (however fluid this one
exchangeis), never exploding into "sensurround" atomization that involves
different trajectories ofperceptions (smells, touch, etc.), time, narrative
contexts, and psychology (sexuality, forinstance, which is reduced to a
voyeurism).  In the same way, "collaboration" must be defined intwo
different ways, perhaps by the use of two words, rather than by stretching a
single definitionto include both the "potential" that is involved in the
mere juxtaposition of texts, and the actualday-to-day work in which
directors and scientists in a laboratory engage to reach very specificends -
the same problem, as noted earlier on anthrolopolgy, of the "soiled hands."
Though thisis a cursory treatment of the contexts of Hypertext, I think it
points to the main conceptual flaw,which is the failure to define the new
metaphysics in a way that theorists have not already donefor
non-computerized texts, and to demonstrate how the physical presence of the
technology andits operations (beyond the obvious arguments for speed of
access).produce manifest alterationsin the nature of human understanding
that make it markedly different from that reliant on booklibraries.

T.S. Eliot, in "The Function of Criticism," describes the misgivings that
one might have tohypertext as a tool for collecting information (it doesn't,
indeed, produce information - there isno field work in hypertext that is not
already-covered ground), and its need for sensibility:"Comparison and
analysis need only the cadavers on the table; but interpretation is
alwaysproducing parts of the body from its pockets, and fixing them in
place.  And any book, any essay,any note in Notes and Queries, which
produces a fact even of the lowest order about a work ofart is a better
piece of work than nine-tenths of the most pretentious critical journalism,
injournals or books.  We assume, of course, that we are masters and not
servants of facts, and thatwe know that the discovery of Shakespeare's
laundry bills would not be of much use to us; but wemust always reserve
final judgment as to the futility of such research which has discovered
them,in the possibility that some genius will appear who will know of a use
to which to put them. Scholarship, even in its humblest forms, has its
rights; we assume that we know how to use it,and how to neglect it.  Of
course the multiplication of critical books and essays may create, andI have
seen it create, a vicious taste for reading about works of art instead of
reading the worksthemselves, it may supply opinion instead of educating
taste." (Selected Prose [New York:Harcourt Brace Jovanich, 1975] pp. 75-76)
Hypertext puts the laundry bill up front with theinformation on demographics
and the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and is not very useful tosomeone who wants
to meet with a stable, interesting intellect in an informed - but
notinformationally saturated - discussion of Shakespeare; in this way, it is
useful for one who has ataste for organizing stray facts, but not for one
interested in discourse about those facts, which isunfortunate when the
facts themselves cease to be provocative, and when they lose the sheen
ofbeing secret, a unique possession.  Finally, hypertext may have a negative
effect on prose styleitself, which, when its good, is usually polyphonous
and resonant, always pointing to anunderstanding that outside itself.  A
centripetal prose style is fine when the tensions that existbetween the
outward motion of the information is held in a dramatic, tenuous check by
the drawtoward a "conclusion".  However, the model of the "wheel of
information" that Landow drawsfor hypertext does not quite embody this, but
is, rather, a simple creation of minor lineations thatrevolve around an axis
that, itself, offers no synthesis, since that axis that is the site of the
originof the several lineations is the work of literature itself, the
as-yet-undisclosed "orphic" utterance.It would be as if In Memoriam were
required to explain the information that hypertext hadassembled around it,
when the exact opposite was intended.  (Landow's book, which he sayswould
have been more suitable for hypertext, is itself highly repetitive, having
reached most ofits conclusions in the first twenty or so pages.  One grows
suspicious that his failure to delvedeeper into his topic, rather than the
skating through citations, each of which is treated ratheruncritically, were
not the result of some misgivings he himself felt.)

This sounds really great, incredible, amazing.  I saw the link and tried to
go there.  But the link requires a password.  Why give us a link to a site
that requires a user name & password account that we do not have?  Without a
password, we are shut out like Manx.  Can we get in?

WE MUST SUCCEED!
THE BLACK RADICAL CONGRESS CAMPAIGN

The drama of the November 7th elections further revealed the
extent of Black exclusion from U.S. society at the turn of
the century. Local officials, poll managers and attendants,
police and the Supreme Court all played an active role in
stripping Black people of the right to vote. This latest
outrage is but part of a broader, on-going attack on
the gains of previous progressive, labor and radical
movements, and an assault on our communities.

The parallels between the end of the 20th Century and the
end of the 19th Century are striking. Following the Civil
War, Black people led a Reconstruction in which they
asserted their rights to full citizenship. White elites
responded by reasserting ("redeeming") white supremacist
rule. If the Civil Rights Movement represented a "Second
Reconstruction," then the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years
definitely have constituted a "Second Redemption." The
Bush Part II years promise no less. If we assess the 2000
elections against issues of healthcare, stable employment
and livable wages, welfare "reform," education, and the
criminal justice system, it is evident that in the post-
Civil Rights era Black people are being forced back into
the shadows of U.S. political, social and economic life.


THE SECOND REDEMPTION:
AN EROSION OF CIVIL AND SOCIAL RIGHTS

In essence, Blacks are struggling, as we have in the past,
to maintain and improve basic civil and social rights - the
right to health care and shelter, the right to vote, the
right to public education, the right to work for decent
pay and job security. The privatization of public space,
amenities and entitlements is segregating Black people from
these rights and quality of life conditions. Predominantly,
white communities are privatizing common space by "gating"
public roads in an attempt to prevent Black and brown people
from entering their cities and neighborhoods. Racial profiling
by police and private security is used to target Black mall
shoppers, drivers, and pedestrians who may venture into public
spaces where they are not wanted. In Chicago, Detroit, New
York, St. Louis and elsewhere, affordable public housing is
being destroyed - disproportionately displacing Black low-
income families to make space for businesses and private
dwellings for middle-income and upper income whites.

Black families experience isolation and the loss of civil
and social rights in other forms. Fifty percent of Black
children in the U.S. live in poverty. Yet, TANF policies are
removing low-income parents and their children from public
assistance - leaving them vulnerable to unemployment and
private sector wages insufficient to meet shelter, clothing,
food and healthcare needs. The public foster care system
too is removing itself from the care of its wards, one-
half of whom are Black. Increasingly, private agencies are
monitoring these children, and their well-being is subject
not only to the profit margins of private enterprise but
also corruption.


INCARCERATION

As more Black people are pushed from welfare rolls and Black
people find it increasingly difficult to find living wage
employment, they are disproportionately finding themselves
incarcerated in a private, for- profit prison industrial
complex. Corporations contract with local, state, and
federal governments to build and operate facilities
and to provide food, clothing, and other services to an
institutionalized population whose increasing numbers only
serve to fuel private profits. What are the statistics?
Approximately 50 percent of prison inmates are Black and
almost 1 in 3 Black men aged 20-29 is under some type of
correctional control - incarceration, probation, or parole.
Moreover, Black men have a 29 percent chance of serving
time in prison at some point in their lives. Black women
fare little better. They are the fastest growing prison
population and over one-half of them are incarcerated
for nonviolent offenses. Overall, juvenile offenders are
increasingly being treated as adults. Thus, they are subject
to harsher punishments. Racial disparities persist here as
well. Sixty-seven percent of juvenile defendants prosecuted
as adults are Black. And, while Black youth are less likely
than their white counterparts to use drugs, 75 percent of
juvenile defendants charged with a drug offense in an adult
court are Black. Relative to men, incarcerated women and
children are more likely to experience violence and sexual
abuse behind prison walls. Once released, many ex-offenders
experience further loss of civil rights and isolation -
they are often disenfranchised and lose the right to fully
participate in the political process. Additionally, they are
often unable to gain suitable employment, housing, or higher
education.


EDUCATION

While more and more tax dollars are spent on the
incarceration of Black people, predominantly Black public
schools are often unable to meet the academic needs of
student bodies. They are disproportionately located in
poor and low-income communities. They struggle annually
to provide up-to-date books, computers and science
laboratories. Relative to middle-income white school
districts, those of color are more likely to hire low-paid
uncertified teachers for the classroom. They are less able
to offer college preparatory courses and other services that
would enhance children's access to higher education. The
right to quality public education is further threatened by
charter schools and voucher system efforts that will only
serve to further strip tax dollars from public schools
already in economic dire straits. The majority of children
of color will not benefit from either charter or private
school voucher systems. Nor will they benefit from continued
use of curriculums and teaching methods that do not address
their unique experiences.


POLICE STATE

The erosion of civil and social rights are reinforced by
state repression and police violence in the form of racial
profiling, police brutality and murder, and the public
assault on workers rights' to maintain and improve job pay,
benefits, and security. Likewise, the killing of Amadou
Diallo illustrates not only racial profiling but also the
lengths the state is willing to go to maintain control over
Black people. Further, workers have been struggling against
massive layoffs, a decline in real wages, corporate
downsizing, and attacks on unions.


THE TASKS AHEAD

The Black Radical Congress' newly launched national campaign
("Education Not Incarceration! Fight the Police State!")
is well timed and clearly challenges this trend towards
privatization, state violence and repression, and the loss
of civil and social rights. The campaign has five related
Parts. Part I is a petition to make police brutality and
misconduct a federal crime. We are aiming to gather 100,000
signatures for this petition. Part II of the campaign involves
supporting defense work on behalf of the "Charleston Five,"
five South Carolina longshore workers facing imprisonment
for their role in a planned picket against a union-busting
shipping line. The criminal charges they face stem from a
police-instigated confrontation with workers. Part III of
the BRC's national campaign centers around a boycott of the
multinational Sodexho Marriott Services, a major investor
in private, for-profit prisons in the United States. Part
IV of the campaign is our opposition to the privatization
of public education, in the form of vouchers and similar
methods of corporate control. Finally, Part V of this
campaign aims to generate attention (and remedies) to the
ways in which Black women fall prey to state violence -
for instance, the lack of alternative sentencing for women
convicted of drug offenses; the anti-family policies of
prison facilities; and sexual abuse by guards.


A PLAN OF ACTION

Common to all of these components is a recognition that
police violence and repression, and mounting incarceration
rates, are the lynchpin of racial exclusion, gender
oppression, and the declining economic conditions of working
people. Although the various aspects of the campaign fit
together, our campaign is potentially unwieldy for a young
coalition with limited resources. Though each element of
the campaign is equally important we cannot feasibly work
on Parts I through V at the same time. Our Plan of Action
then, is to begin with Parts I and II, "The Petition" and
the "Charleston Five," both of which emphasize our direct
challenge to state repression and the steady erosion of
our civil and social rights. One of the indicators of our
success will be the extent to which we fortify our existing
Local Organizing Committees and build new ones, and cement
relationships with other coalitions. We ask other organizations
to join us in this struggle. As the landscape grows bleaker, it
is at least clear that "Education Not Incarceration! Fight the
Police State!" is a campaign we do not have the luxury of
forfeiting.

I was just informed that Bill Truesdale died last night or
early this morning. He was the founder and, for many
years, the publisher of New Rivers Press, which began
back in the late 60s on a press in the basement of Bill's
home in Nyack, New York. The press's later wanderings
took it to New York City and then on to Minneapolis/
St. Paul.

In its early years New Rivers published poetry collections
by Charles Baxter, Charles Simic, John Knoepfle, Margaret
Randall, Roger Mitchell and others, including myself.

Bill Truesdale was himself a poet.

        Astronaut

        after the operation
        ashes   a full moon
        a light wintery and blurred
        evidence of some natural disaster

        after the operation
        he dreamed of walking
        like a moon
        in the dust of dead planets
        though he cared nothing
        for gravity
        or distinction

        after the operation
        he was lying in a cloud

        when the others came into the room
        he could still see
        how they shaped themselves
        around a name
        and certain mechanical expressions
        the word 'shadows'
        stuck in his mind
        like a feather

        after the operation
        he thought of ears
        and words walking into them
        trying and trying
        to find a connection
        was it honey or balm
        they would offer
        at the heart of the maze?
        but long   long before
        they fell down exhausted
        and dried into nothing
        like the eye of a lizard

        after the operation
        he went gladly into exile from himself
        and I could control him
        without difficulty
        even to Jupiter and beyond

Susan (and List people).  I dont know many of the writers on Tinfish, but I
am aware of Michelle Leggott's work. If people can also get a copy of her
book DIA (or any other eg AS FAR AS I CAN SEE) they will see that she is one
of the most extraordinarily talented poets I have read. I dont say that
because she is a fellow New Zealander or because  I know her particularly
well ( tho she was briefly one of my lecturers in 1992) but because (altho I
was a bit indifferent to or a bit "puzzled" by her work at first)  I took
"the devil's advocate" after she had given a reading about 1994 from DIA
with a guy (who had heard that reading) and  who felt DIA was "too
intellectual" etc which was a bit ironic because this fellow ws always
quoting from Yeats (and if Yeats isnt intellectual then I'm a blue Bavarian
bo-weevil)..Anycase I spent several weeks studying DIA, following references
etc and was very excited by the combination of imagination and craft. I have
no connection to, ie I am quite disinterested in this. It is simply that
Leggott is quite brilliant: more than that. More than that.  Regards all,
Richard Taylor.

Vol. 7, No. 1539 - The American Reporter - March 1, 2001


 ...AS ANOTHER ASKS HIGH COURT FOR JUSTICE FOR WRITERS
by Joyce Marcel
American Reporter Correspondent
Dummerston, Vt.

DUMMERSTON, Vt. -- Dear Ken Burns, Doris Kearns Goodwin, and other big-name,
beloved and well-paid members of the liberal history Establishment:
Please -- and I say this in the spirit of friendly bipartisanship so
prevalent everywhere -- go to hell. Love, Joyce.

Oral arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court case The New York Times et. al.
(Time Magazine, the Lexis/Nexis database, and a microfilm company) v.
Jonathan Tasini are set for March 28, and the lines are being drawn.

On one side are freelance writers like myself, as well as historians of the
caliber of Jacques Barzan and respected non-fiction writers such as Tracy
Kidder, James Glieck, and Nicholas Lemann.

On the other side, for reasons that can only be considered obtuse, stand
Burns, Goodwin and a few Pulitzer Prize winners.

The struggle goes back to 1995, when the media entered the Internet age.

In accordance with U.S. copyright law, when newspapers and magazine buy a
freelancer's work, they are buying only the first North American serial
rights -- in other words, the one-time-only print rights. Then the rights
revert to us, the creators, to be resold or reshaped.

Once the Internet entered the picture, however, the words "print rights"
became an obstacle.

The New York Times led the way in designing a freelance contract that took
away all a creator's rights -- Web rights, print rights, plus rights to
media that didn't even exist yet ("media throughout the universe" became a
popular contractual phrase) -- and offered no money in return.

It was as if you had asked a plumber to come to your home and fix a leaky
faucet, then required him to install a shower for no extra charge if he
wanted to keep your business.

I was on the sticking end of one of those contracts when I was a music
critic for the Springfield (MA) Union-News and Sunday Republican. I asked to
be paid for the additional rights. The paper refused. I left, because I do
not believe that schoolyard bullies should be encouraged.

Fighting back, Tasini, the president of the National Writers Union (of which
I am a member), took the Times to court. He lost the first round, but won on
appeal. Now the case is in the hands of the Supremes.

In the meantime, I began freelancing for The Boston Globe, which is owned by
The New York Times. Soon another contract came down the pike.

The Globe wanted to put my stories on line, both the ones I would write and
all the ones I had already written. They also wanted the power to revise,
add to, and create new work out of my work. However, in an end-run around
Tasini, they offered to share -- not money, of course, but my copyright.
With me. Who already owns it.

Then I learned that the Globe has been selling individual pieces of mine
on-line, without my permission, my knowledge, or any legal right, for years.
That accounted for the retroactive clause in the contract.

If I signed, I would be validating their theft of my work. Again, I could
not. My income took a nose-dive.

Although many Globe freelancers signed the contract in order to support
their families, some of us organized and took the paper to court.

One of the saddest days of my life came when Suffolk Superior Court Judge
Ralph Gants heard the Globe's motion to dismiss our suit.

"We are bargaining from a position of superior strength, and it is within
our ability to ask for more rights," the Globe's lawyer said. "(The
freelancers) have the right to find other publishers."

Like it or lump it, he was saying; it was that cold.

Because I treasure newspapers and believe in their mission to "comfort the
afflicted and afflict the comfortable," I was shocked to see such an unjust
power grab coming from an institution for which I had so much respect.

In the end, Gants ruled in our favor.

He said, "... this Court finds that ... the modification of a contract may
be in bad faith when it is procured through an ultimatum in which a company
threatens an independent contractor, even an independent contractor who is
terminable at will, with termination."

The case proceeds; we are now in the discovery phase.

In the meantime, a federal Court of Appeals heard the Napster case, which is
remarkably similar to ours, and ruled in favor of intellectual property
rights on the Internet.

When Napster lost, the Times editorial page on Feb. 14 called the decision a
major victory "for all creators of original material," and said that the
Internet should not become "a duty-free zone where people can plunder the
intellectual property of others without paying for it."

Tasini immediately responded with an article entitled, "The Hypocrisy of The
New York Times" (http://www.nwu.org/tvt/schypoc.htm).

Arguments both for and against the freelancers have now been filed with the
Supreme Court. (See them at http://www.nwu.org/tvt/sc.htm).

The Times argues that if it loses, it will be forced to delete freelancers'
work before it puts its paper online, thus defacing the historical record.

Burns, Goodwin, Pulitzer prize winner David McCullough, David Kennedy and
others, in a friend-of-the-court brief, are buying into this specious
argument, this threat. They are caving in to the bully.

They choose to believe that the Times will delete Op-Ed pieces, letters,
features, etc.

And that will threaten, they say, "the completeness and integrity of the
nation's electronic archives."

They are not arguing that the Times would never do such a thing. Or that it
should pay freelancers for the work it is merrily stealing. Or that it can
well afford to pay. They do not question the immorality of the Times'
actions.

I imagine that people like Burns and the Goodwins have lawyers, agents,
editors and publishers ready to strike down in a New York minute anyone who
threatens to make money off their copyrighted work.

So why are they so freely asking freelancers like myself to give up our
rights?

On our side, the historians and writers argue: "It is extremely important
for authors to control the use and deposition of their works and for them to
share in the economic benefits derived from the use of their works."

They also argue for the original Copyright Act's "careful balance between
encouraging the dissemination of knowledge and granting the market
incentives needed to maintain a healthy store of knowledge."

Even the Copyright Office agrees with us.

Marybeth Peters, the Register of Copyrights, entered a statement into the
Congressional Record that said, in part, "The freelance authors assert that
they have a legal right to be paid for their work. I agree... . And I reject
the publishers' protests that recognizing the authors' rights would mean
that publishers would have to remove the affected articles from their
databases.

"The issue in Tasini should not be whether the publishers should be enjoined
from maintaining their databases of articles intact, but whether authors are
entitled to compensation for downstream uses of their works."

Many publications are beginning to recognize the truth of this statement and
work with their freelancers. Brill's Content, Harpers, the Atlantic Monthly,
and even the Wall Street Journal now pay for extra rights.

And the NWU has created a clearing house to serve as a negotiator for all
freelancers, so the newspapers and magazines are not faced with the
frightening and time-consuming prospect of dealing with each freelancer on
an individual basis.

It is always possible that Burns and Goodwins, et alii do not understand the
real issues here. Have our major intellectuals allowed themselves to be
duped by the newspaper of record?

I do not know. But in the famous words of Samuel Johnson, "No man but a
blockhead ever wrote, except for money."

So shame on you, Burns and Goodwin, et al. Freelance writers have a moral
and legal right to profit from their work, and I can only hope the Supreme
Court sees the justice of this cause.

however evangelical many of the early claims for electronic this & that may
appear a decade hence, i wouldn't exactly call them "naive"... there was a
conscious attempt at the very least to worry conundrums---of media, genre,
form, authorship, audience---that, judging by the several posts i've just
read hereabouts, are still very much with us (which isn't to say that
anyone hereabouts is "naive," either, but---)...

for me a primary problem with a lot of the early theorizing is that it came
out of a specifically literary-academic, and frequently narrative,
perspective (jim rosenberg an exception here), which saw (and in some sense
stills sees) its lineage (if you will) primarily in terms of computational
histories (ted nelson's work in particular)... which is fine as far as it
goes---and sure, nelson was the first, far as we know, to use the term
"hypertext"...

but whereas for example brazilian artist eduardo kac (now with the school
of the art institute of chicago) was doing some amazing (and amazingly
conceptual) electronic media-based art a decade ago, you're unlikely to
find any mention made of him... or of our very own miekal and, or alan
sondheim, or...

but really now:  ~hyper/text/theory~ (ed. by george landow, and the
collection to which barrett perhaps makes reference) is not really naive,
is it?... let's look a little deeper into some of the difficulties
addressed therein... e.g., martin rosenberg's reading of hypertext in light
of contemporary physics and chaos theory, and stuart moulthrop's response
to the problem rosenberg poses (which raises the question of the temporal
vs. the spatial etc.)...

on a more anecdotal (and self-aggrandizing!) note:  i was involved in a lot
of the discussion re hypertext and the coming web, c. 91/92/93, on the old
technoculture list (run by stuart moulthrop while at georgia tech, and with
many of the principals (?---ok?) subbed to same), and there was plenty---as
in PLENTY---of talk of the internet in terms of its pre-internet history...
sure, i would answer mea culpa mself to the charge of occasional
evangelical exhortation (though my early, largely positive (electronic)
review of jay david bolter's ~writing space~ took up this question of form
rather directly, arguing that bolter's treatise might have done better to
break from sentence/para format)...

anyway... for me, the most urgent questions re the arrival of the digital
continue to be less about form per se (which is an issue, sure, in so many
ways) and more about the potential for
collaboration/distribution/interaction among otherwise disconnected
communities (term used advisedly), organizations, alliances, what have you,
and how formal attributes might be moored to such, uhm, tentative
moorings...

best,

joe

Hey,

I have a track on this cool new 3-CD project by Elliott Sharp just released
by the Electronic Music Foundation with a beautiful package designed by
Janene Higgins.  Check it out:

State of the Union 2.001

This amazing 3-CD set of contemporary sound and text-based electric and
electronic music may be just what you need to live a full life. Composer /
performer Elliott Sharp has set aside his saxophone and put his guitar on
the shelf for just long enough to collect one-minute music and sound works
by 171 leading lights of the international avant-garde, both famous and
unknown, that represent a vast array of approaches, attitudes, aesthetics,
ethnicities, musical styles, and social persuasions. He describes the
collection as "concrete, abstract, enraged, objective, caustic, soulful,
sardonic, provocative -- all unfiltered, all clear." It's more than that.
It's totally enjoyable. Unmissable. A bandwagon you should get on without
missing a beat.

Artists include:  Fred Frith, Murat Nehmet-Nejat, Tracie Morris, Queen
Esther, Harry Smith, Ikue Mori, Jacob Burckhardt, Jenn Reeves, Lo

Taliban Begins Smashing All Afghan Statues

By Sayed Salahuddin

KABUL (Reuters) - The radical ruling Taliban movement began smashing all
statues from Afghanistan's rich cultural past on Thursday, defying
international appeals to save the ancient artifacts.

Taliban Information and Culture Minister Mullah Qudratullah Jamal said
centers where the campaign had been unleashed included Bamiyan province --
site of two soaring statues of the Buddha hewn from a solid cliff that are
the most famous relics of Afghanistan's history.

``All statues will be destroyed,'' he told reporters in the capital Kabul.
``Whatever means of destruction are needed to demolish the statues will be
used.

``The work began early during the day. All of the statues are to be smashed.
This also covers the idols in Bamiyan,'' he said.

The Taliban rejected a last-minute U.N. appeal when its Foreign Minister
Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil told an envoy on Thursday the movement would complete
the destruction of the statues it regards as un-Islamic.

``The abandoned relics are not our pride,'' the official Bakhtar news agency
quoted Muttawakil as telling U.N. special envoy for Afghanistan Francesc
Vendrell, who arrived in Kabul with an appeal from U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.

``Destroying them would not mean that the freedom of the minorities would
cease,'' Muttawakil said.

The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press news service later quoted Jamal as
saying statues had been destroyed at museums in Kabul, the southern city of
Ghazni, the western city of Herat and at Farm Hadda near the main eastern
town of Jalalabad.

Russia, Germany, India and Pakistan condemned the destruction and appealed
to the Taliban to think again.

Buddhist countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka have also expressed alarm at
the Taliban's focus on eradicating reminders of the centuries before Islam
when Afghanistan was a center of Buddhist learning and pilgrimage.

Egyptian Muslim intellectual Fahmi Howeidy said the Taliban edict ran
contrary to Islam.

``Islam respects other cultures even if they include rituals that are
against Islamic law,'' Howeidy told Reuters in Cairo.

International alarm was first sparked on Monday, when Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammad Omar ordered the smashing of all statues, including the two famous
Buddhas that soar 38 meters (125 feet) and 53 meters (174 feet) above
Bamiyan.

The United Nations cultural agency UNESCO appealed directly to the Taliban
on Wednesday to reverse its decision and also urged Muslim nations around
the world to halt the destruction.

Muslim Pakistan, one of Taliban's very few foreign supporters, joined the
international chorus on Thursday.

``Pakistan attaches great importance to and supports the preservation of the
world's historical, cultural and religious heritage,'' the foreign ministry
said.

With the campaign already underway, Foreign Secretary Inamul Haque told
reporters: ``We hope the Afghanistan government would give serious
consideration to this international appeal, including that by UNESCO and
others, and that they will not demolish the cultural heritage of
Afghanistan.''

U.N. Appeal To Protect Relics

India said it would try to stop the destruction.

``The government of India will raise this issue at every international forum
including the United Nations. We will make all attempts to stop the
demolition of Lord Buddha's statue,'' parliamentary affairs minister Pramod
Mahajan told parliament.

Russia denounced the Taliban step as vandalism.

``This intention (to destroy the statues) can only be classed as an assault
on cultural and historical treasures, not only of the Afghan people but of
world civilization,'' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on
Thursday.

``The Taliban's vandalism against material objects of the rich spiritual
heritage of the ancient Afghan world shows their clear enmity to common
human values,'' it added.

Germany condemned the Taliban action.

``Germany is appalled by the willful destruction of cultural artifacts in
Afghanistan. The damage to culturally unique Buddha statues by the Taliban
cannot be justified,'' the foreign ministry said in a statement issued in
Berlin.

The European Union said it was shocked.

``The EU strongly urges the Taliban leadership not to implement this deeply
tragic decision which will deprive the people of Afghanistan of its rich
cultural heritage,'' the EU said in a statement issued by Sweden, which
holds the rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc.

A fundamentalist movement that regards all human likenesses of divinity to
be un-Islamic, the Taliban has steadily conquered most of Afghanistan in
recent years, and now controls its cities and highways.

The destruction of artifacts has inflicted new damage to the Taliban's
already poor ties with most countries.

Heavily criticized for its restrictions on women and for its public
executions, the Taliban is recognized by only three states: Pakistan, the
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

Afghanistan has suffered destruction at the hands of many conquerors in the
past. Most recently it suffered a Soviet invasion in 1979, an anti-communist
insurgency backed by the West in the 1980s and a civil war in the 1990s.

but this is still not an *innovation* but an *enhancement*, albeit a very
beneficial one that allows for certain emergent possibilities.

Personalization is precisely one of the bases for the critique inherent in
proximate and is something i want to share with other people.  I think
personalization is a very negative part of the internet.  i think
"personalization" is one of the DARKEST aspect of the internet for a number
of reasons.  it distances and abstracts human relations.  we already have
enough problems when we have one guy representing 300 million people.
"personalization" is a way of automating that type of distal cold
insensitive and inhumane relationship.  one guy sits alone in an office and
concocts rules for how each individual is to be spoken to?  it is also
*deceptive*, in that people like amazon.com will call it personalization,
but then give you a book suggestion, call it personalized, when in fact it
has nothing to do with your tastes and it was put there just so amazon could
unload their overstock.  that is, personalization is a way of abstracting
distancing and manipulating human relations for individual or concentrated
gain.  it reinforces the master class and builds a wider gap between master
and serf.  and it is all based on surveillance.

to me this is just a different instantiation of personalization, and in this
form, people are sucked into making closer and closer relations with
machines, automated systems, and get farther and farther away from the
flesh, from interacting with people.  this helps the internet in all its
panoptic glory complete its functioning as a device of division and
conquest.

i think the promise is very limited.  and it requires more and more
dependence on controlled commodities like electricity cable and phone.
you've got to own this device for $1000 and that device for $2000 and then
pay $50 a month to use it plus another $50 a month just to turn it on.  it's
all part of a capital frenzy.  i'm about to spend some time in a hut in
mexico without running water or electricity or phone, and one point in the
planning i found myself trying to imagine how i could get an internet
connection in such conditions.  this is the addicted mind speaking.
naturally i had to beat that down and choose not to bring the laptop.

i do like autechre.

the only potentialities of the internet are of automation of a distributed
indifferent and wholly silicon panoptic control system.  a nice side effect
of that panoptic capability is, since it needs text to distribute
information (re: propaganda) quickly, it has allowed for alternative forms
of information to creep in.    but the problems with text on the internet,
as far as its role in a panoptic structure, rest not with the internet but
with the technology of text itself and what a person plans to do with it.
some people plan to control others in a number of ways with text, and only
rarely does text become open and freeing, liberating, moving towards and
emotive flavor as opposed to a meaning-directed means of communication.
it's either "hear my story" or "imagine or feel these words and what you
create as a result."  i've always been more interested in and moved by what
creative writing and music does to my mind as opposed to what such pieces
actually mean or set out to accomplish.

I think the only potentiality of the internet that could be exploited &
expanded ultimately is that of text and image.  at its inception, the
internet was a text and, later, image delivery device. both text and image
usually function to either represent/induce or generate.  by generate i mean
that text and image aim to create something in the audience, but what is
created need not correspond in any specific way to what the original.
delivering ambiguous emotive text is a way to create this generative type of
relationship between author and audience, and it also serves to downplay the
importance of the author to a huge extent.   so for poetry to express the
potentiality of the internet, it would need to aim to either induce
something specific meaning to its audience (just as an ad would instruct a
viewer to purchase something) or it would need to expand this possibility of
generative relationships between an audience in his or her world (since the
author begins to fade).  in my strong opinion if poetry were to express the
potentiality of the internet in a positive way (not destructive) it would
aim to expand the potential of text (or text and image, since text is an
image of sorts) to generate things in its audience without regard to the
correspondence of text or image to their resulting thoughts.  efforts to use
poetry to induce or enforce seem to be only marginally poetic but would also
express the potentiality of the internet.

anyway, such efforts can be done completely independent of technology though
the internet makes it easier to do such things.  whether flash or html or
dhtml, etc., will not mean much for poetry, and poetry in the internet age,
in the long run.

one of the marvelous results of the nature of the internet to move people to
the post-authorial is the notion of copyleft.  it still assumes authors and
owners but desanctifies them while tacitly encouraging them to share such
material, based on a notion that many things are shared to begin with, that
authorship is some sort of a myth anyway.

Rev Dest I presume.  A strange message. That "sacred" should be "dirty" is
your little dig at (at some persons  who dont like the word sacred!). Then
you claim that it is the task of the poet to register events. Well if that
was so, then poets mught be better as journalists or even scientists. What
events? What and or whose reality? How not - somehow - to inevitably
distort, or if not distort, to intervene between any message sent and the
recipient? f course one shouldnt be  (in certain senses of the word)
"manipulative" but in many other ways its essential (I feel) for a writer to
be just that. If we are not manipulating language into new forms and ideas,
then what are we, if we are poets, doing? Somehow you seem to feel that
every word is always unambiguous. What of contexts and connotations?  Why
your term "slimy"? What precision? Prove to me how we can give an exact
measure of, say, the area of a circle, given that pi is a transcendental
number (has no precise numerical value - proved by J. von Neumann). Thus
probability and context is important.
  But you then make some big jumps to "saving the species" which is a pretty
futile thing to concern anyone. I dont know who or what is going to "save
the species" .. What species?  We're simply animals with larger brains
(relative to body weight). Sure we may have a soul and all that kinda stuff
but how does that all connect up?  If a poet is (he/she is surely by
definition) a maker then why does that necessarily imply that one should
transform oneself to an artist? Define artist. I consider a poet to be an
artist already.
  You "surprised yourself". No wonder. This "coordinology" sounds like a
shovel load of turnips.  As if we didnt have sufficient obfuscation...ok
perhaps if we are talking of a "writerly" text etc but not much use here.
  Be more interesting to hear some considered views of the meeting, which
hasnt been reported very well.  Doent mean it wasnt good. But your "point"
seems meaningless to me. But maybe I'm misreading. Regards, Richard.

Dodie Bellamy & Michelle Tea


Annoyingly, these two San Francisco novelists of overlapping generations
have formed a mutual admiration society in
recent months. Dodie Bellamy, the influential fiction writer and essayist,
is one of the important voices of our moment. At
its best, her writing embodies syntax with a devastating confessional
eros, a writing haunting as Messiaen, steamy as Macy
Gray. Simultaneously it collapses the boundaries between the marketing
tools we ordinarily think of as novel, poem, theory,
elegy, punchline, criticism, and allegory. Since she left the directorate
of Small Press Traffic two years ago she has been
teaching, writing journalism and working on a new novel, The Fourth Form,
a "multi-dimensional romance." Dodie
Bellamy is the author of Feminine Hijinx (Hanuman, 1990), Real: The
Letters of Mina Harker and Sam D'Allesandro
(Talisman House, 1995) and The Letters of Mina Harker (Hard Press, 1998),
as well as three chapbooks. She teaches
creative writing at Mills College and at San Francisco State.


Michelle Tea is the brilliant young author of two recent novels, The
Passionate Mistakes and Intricate Corruption of
One Girl in America (Semiotext(e) Native Agents Series, 1998) and Valencia
(Seal Press, 2001), which have catapulted
her amidst a sea of controversy to the front of the pack. One of only a
handful of great novels actually written in San
Francisco, Valencia is an impossibly romantic, angry, poetic, tender and
dazed epic of the dyke underground of our city's
Valencia Street--a crazy urban bohemia which seemed to flourish and
dissipate right before our eyes at the same
post-industrial moment. Some find Tea's psychotropic maximalism taxing and
artless, but the smart ones bow down, as one
might to a radical blend of Kathy Acker, Eileen Myles, and Carson
McCullers. She is a founding member of Sister Spit,
the women's travelling art/spoken word/music collective.

To Alan etal. I sent this to a friend who has a political site (I'll give
the link another time its called "3rd eye") which is concerned in NZ with
local active politics and issues of injustice, justice, workers struggles
etc. The editors are also interested in lit. developments etc.
  Its interesting, because I have a friend who thinks that racialism will
gradually fade away as people of different ethnicity etc "get used to each
other". I think this is naive. I know that racialism is "under the surface
here in NZ" (if not open while not particularly "institutionalised- altho I
could be wrong even on that) Also Australia hasnt got a good record still in
regard to its "keep Australlia white" policy, or its treatment of the
indigenous peoles. I am also encountering people here (NZ) who are paranoid
about whom they term "the Asians".  Chinese, Thai,  etc are hated by large
numbers of (a certain kind of) New Zealanders who one could say are
"losers".They probably blame whatever they've "lost" on everything but the
cause - themselves.But racialism is world wide and its interesting more
discussion of its intersection with poetics has not been (prior to this by
Alan, sent on) much. Maybe we are over preoccupied with being published or
with the technology of the net? Maybe we are ignoring other writers from
other cultures. I know that I myself have only more recently become more
interested in Maoritanga...the extraordinary richness of that culture in
Aotearoa (NZ) and also the Pacific Art. Perhaps I've been purblind to such
an "intersection"... Reminds me that Olson was deeply interested in the
indigenous and other arts....Pollock in the American Indian...at least these
guys were interested...how has Western poetics reacted to and or learnt from
African,Oceanic,Hispanic and other arts? Is ashberic or language poetry too
"selfish", too Eurocentric? My own? Or can it open a "link" etc? And so on.
This might be an oblique comment on Barrett Watten's "demon of analogy":
here I was able to pass this on very easily at a distance of some, what,
15000 miles? One value of the internet at least perhaps? Regards all,
Richard.

Sorry about the password requirement. When I originally went to the site, I

This sounds really great, incredible, amazing.  I saw the link and tried to
go there.  But the link requires a password.  Why give us a link to a site
that requires a user name & password account that we do not have?  Without a
password, we are shut out like Manx.  Can we get in?

I completely agree with your disgust for "personalization" as it stands
today. The average Web user has no idea the multitude of ways in which
their personal and private information is exploited for business profit
and I don't have much faith in our legislature to correct the situation
(though COPPA and HIPPA regulations seem to actually be trying for their
smaller groups: children and health info). Of course, going to Amazon
and not thinking they are just trying to sell you more stuff would be
extremely naive.

And I agree that there isn't anything personal about "personalization."
It's much more akin to racial profiling, and you are very right to call
those aspects out onto the carpet. As far as it being a particularly
dark aspect of the net... well that is only as long as people remain
naive about it. In commerce, it uses the same concepts companies use in
choosing what shows they'll buy commercials on, or product placement or
any of that jazz. All significantly dark, yes, but not new.

That said, I do think there are a number of ways in which dynamic
publishing driven through a rules-based system (a more technical
description of "personalization"?) can be used artistically. Especially
when the "drivers" for that system are tied to things not inherent in
the system's user, like the time of day, current online traffic, choices
other people are making on the site; as well as information about the
individual user: their IP address, location, time of day in their
geographic location, as well as their clickstream habits.

For instance, someone had brought up a desire to control the rhythm
musicality of a text based on "linking time," and this is something that
could be more easily controlled through a browser and connection speed
detect (or overtly through asking the user, of course).

That kind of control doesn't interest me so much, but it is an
interesting case. I see these dynamic posibilities more interesting in
removing levels of control over the text and exponentially growing
possible user-text relationships and meanings. To me it seems to me just
a really complex version of something like Queneau's 100,000,000,000,000
Poems (did I get the right number of zeroes). Or like a book that is
able to continuously reshuffle the pages with or without the readers
knowledge. I just think there are many things to do/be done through this
approach and it is refreshing for me as so much hasn't been done with it
yet.

From another standpoint, the technology seems to present an opportunity
to foreground/critique the way in which all texts employ the "insidious"
version of personalization you speek of. The way all text (but
especially those with commercial purposes) are constructed to play on
our individual hopes or weaknesses, use tailored rhetorics to limit and
guide our responses, and are delivered through controlled channels of
distribution to reach best potential target audiences. Again, not a new
project, but another way to approach it?

perhaps for clarification's sake:  i might mention that the old
technoculture list ultimately foundered (as in, melted down) on what
amounted to gender issues (i would say), and on a critique of what seemed
to some (of us) a white male, treasure island approach to the internet...
though of course, as in the flamewar that impacted *this* list, it's fair
to observe that everyone probably ended up feeling bad for everyone else...

and it was the absence of sufficient scrutiny---not to form, again,
but---to issues of gender/race/class and so forth that, as i see it,
comprised the prevailing blindness many of "us" operated under at the time
(could this be called naivete?  perhaps)... which isn't to say, again, that
various ethnic groups, so defined (i am thinking here of the relatively
early development of native web, of art mcgee's, well, heroic work toward
establishing an african-american presence on the internet, etc.) weren't
present from the get-go (arpanet included, gay activists included, etc.)...
there's been a lot of subsequent work in these areas since...

but no history, at least none that i'm aware of, that really captures in
depth the last two decades of digital development in the public domain,
esp. with due regard for more activist contributions... any of you folks
aware of such an item?...

best,

Susan Maxwell is attempting to figure out how to be a writer and
dancer at the same time and is open to suggestions. She has worked
with many talented Bay Area choreographers performing in boats, on
swinging poles and on stages in San Francisco, San Diego and New
York. She has also directed her own dance theatre work as a resident
at the Jon Sims Center for the Performing Arts.  Her writing has
appeared or will appear in Chain, ZYZYYVA, San Jose Manual of Style,
Fence and Born Magazine.  It explores the kinetics of words on the
page.  She is currently the Iowa Arts Fellow at the snow-laden Iowa
Writer's Workshop.

Warren Liu was born in Buffalo, New York.  He studied English at UC
Berkeley and received an M.F.A. from the Iowa Writer's Workshop.
Currently he is working towards a doctoral degree at UC Berkeley
focusing on contemporary Asian-American experimental poets.  His own
poetry resists full disclosures and unidirectional readings, forming
a highly compacted whorl of instances. We hear that his new work is
prose.

The Stork Club is in downtown Oakland, 2330 Telegraph Ave between
23rd and 24th St.
By BART: get off at 19th St, walk one block west to Telegraph, then up
about 5 blocks, just past 23rd.  The Stork Club has a large and vivid sign.

how would that work, do you think, in the context of something like
amazon.com's new honor system where writers can take contributions for work
they put on the web?  say, for example, you were to write an article for the
NYTimes and also post it on your homepage.

Writers Forum, run by Bob Cobbing, is about to publish its 1000th
publication. N.B. It already has published more than 1000, but this is the
official 1000th publication...

The idea was to produce a pretty big anthology, called ON WORD, edited by
Bob Cobbing and Lawrence Upton, but the money to make it possible was not
forthcoming.

Therefore, it is to be published as a part-work with parts coming out every
few months. This is far from ideal, but it *is financially possible and we
hope that many will support it with standing orders so that it brings the
press a regular income.

(All such matters to New River Project, 89a Petherton Rd, London N5 2QT
please, with s.a.e.; though, when I get price information from Bob, I'll
post it here)

ON WORD Part One has an editors' preface; an introduction by Adrian Clarke;
an introduction by Lawrence Upton; and contributions - poetry and
statements - by Adrian Clarke, Karen Mac Cormack, Maggie O'Sullivan and
Lawrence Upton.

Subsequent parts will feature statements and poetry.

ON WORD part one will be published next Saturday, 10th March 2001, with a
reading by Adrian Clarke, Lawrence Upton and (to be confirmed) Maggie
O'Sullivan at 3.30 pm at Betsey Trotwood, Farringdon Road, London E C 1.
(The reading will be part of the ongoing workshop series and there will be
workshop activity on that day as well - the exact order of things is up to
Mr Cobbing as always)

this has nothing to do with anything - but i thot
it may be amusing for one or two

a few years back i worked on a cycle of pomes
whose mode of construction consisted entirely of
cut-ups from other sources - rearranged from 2
and 3 word fragments - one the the "words" was
MEHMEDINOVIC - i never knew who or what that was
until now - and given the finished product it
seems strangely apropos as in the pome
MEHMEDINOVIC is a kind of apopolyctic figure

i've been keeping my eye out for years for the
name to see who it was - and now i know

if anyone cares to recommend any of his work to
me, i'd be most interested in giving it a look

i've been looking for resources on the net and at
the local library on the "pantoum" form but
information seems scarce - aside from
explanations and one or two samples

are there any pantoum anthologies? i've been
looking for translations of Malaysian pantoums,
and my searches have come up blank

i've been obsessed with the form lately - writing
2 or 3 a week - some of them even readable - i
chalk it up to the Muse Pantoumia - a lovely
women who is known to repeat herself

odd that no one has a website devoted to them -
perhaps i ought to correct that, i doubt
www.pantoum.com has been registered yet, tho who
knows?

Subject:      Demon of Analogy
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding:  7bit

The context of my question--on the early, even premature, analogizing of
hypertext with most variants of poststructuralist decentering of
authorship, narrativity, and content--was a preliminary presentation I gave
at Wayne State last Thursday on the relation between radical forms that
preceded the internet and what has come since. The posts I received from
many--particularly Carolyn Guertin offline and Patrick Herron both on and
off--were enormously helpful in beginning to construct a bibliography of
sites and to organize the information (in ways that, importantly, are
suggested by the nature of the information). I'm continuing to work on that
bibliography (which is not complete enough to show yet, but I hope will
eventually be), and so continue to seek links.

I'll paste the schedule of our discussion group to a separate post, and
anyone in the Detroit area would be certainly welcome to attend. So far,
we've heard from Ron Day about utopian models for information organization
that conceptually resemble the internet but date from the first half of the
twentieth century, a movement called "Documentation" in France that dates
from the postwar period, and the relevance of the Autonomist movement,
particularly Toni Negri, to a Marxist critique of the information
technology. That possibility was more fully developed in a talk by Nick
Dyer-Witheford, from Windsor, Ontario, who gave a critical reading of that
movement and showed how terms like "general intelligence" from Negri and
"species being" in Marx can be useful in figuring out what kinds of
oppositional politics the internet affords (and he focused on three areas:
electronic media as sites of political action (WTO analogy); the
decommodification of information (Napster analogy); and a more general
possibility of "self-making" through the intersubjectivity (species-being
analogy). Each of these were framed as responses to the occultation of
value in what I think of as a kind of romantic Marxism (predicated on a
return to wholeness, agency, and a positive relation to nature), but one
that ought to be acceptable to poets, certainly--at least those who read
the romantic movement as crucial to the episteme in which our oftentimes
very decentered and unauthorial work proceeds.

Opening some questions this way leads immediately to: what kind of agency
can we imagine through the new technology, if not one predicated on a kind
of prelapsarian analogy (as a counter to valorizing Napster, I would
question whether, in encouraging widespread "piracy" of copyrighted
materials, it leads to anything but unfettered consumerism and an illusion
of access rather than a critical distance from the nature of commodified
culture itself). So the question of analogy would have immediate political
consequences, though that is not where we started out with the relation of
"theory" to the new technology. Charles Stivale, who writes on Deleuze and
Guattari, gave a short talk on kinds of posts in MOO spaces and the
relation between posts that adhered to the "theme" of the site (such as the
poetics listserv) and posts that digress. I'm sure you are all familiar
with that tension. But the dyad transparency (to the "theme" of the
site)/opacity (digressing in posts that disrupt the "theme") leads
immediately to all kinds of parallels in the poetry world. I am thinking
particularly of the tension between thematization and digression in the
performance work of Steve Benson, its relation between constructing a work
and playfully undoing it at the same time) as anticipating this dynamic.
(And here I'd like to encourage another look at Steve's work, from *Blue
Books* on, for its simultaneity of construction and dismantling.)

My presentation involved the information I received from a number of
sources in the time period previous to the talk, and my organization of
that information. Hence, multiauthorship was at the center of what I was
thinking about. I wanted to look at work from the earlier period of
Language writing such as Steve Benson's improvised work, as above, that
might predict some of the possibilities valorized by Landow et al. prior to
the technology itself. They are abundantly there. The illustrations to my
piece on Legend, since they appear in the online version of the article,
were easily accessible, and I clicked on those. I also wanted to point out
the relation of language-centered magazines from the 70s--really, the whole
history of the little magazine--as the direct precursor of the zine format,
and hence a crucial form of multiauthorship. I had about 85 links that I
wanted to survey and organize, and they fell into the following categories:

Sites: Individuals
Links: Individuals (including home pages that function as "works")
Sites: Multi-authors
Projects: Multi-authors (like the "International Dictionary of Neologisms")
Links: Multi-authors (ubuweb, etc.)
Zines
Essays

The interesting aspect of this for me was that it was often hard to decide
which category would be best for a given url. But all of these, except
instances of the first and last, are entirely multi-authorial. With sites,
there are indeed sites that can be seen as "autonomous works"--along the
lines of a poem in the old sense--and could be described as such. And a few
of the essays were monological. However, most of the essays were
hyperlinked, making them akin, really, to many of the link or project
sites. The form of the essay, then, seems to be changing from being
centrally addressed to the coherence of an argument (Emerson) to be
valorized for the number and richness of links (though I haven't seen it
yet, I imagine Brian's essay to be of this nature). This is something I'd
like to further explore, then--the nature of the internet essay. What are
some outstanding or definitive instances of the genre, assuming that it is
starting to turn into one?

The second point of focus was the status of the analogy. I find deeply
problematic the claim that "link" itself--the act of linking, text to
footnote, site to site, etc.--constitutes the formal foundation of the
internet. In other words, mere rhizomic structure is not enough. Not as
structure, but for the way that there is an inference that content and link
are identical, that content is delivered *as* the link. Linking is content.
So a slogan like "where do you want to go today" implies that the place you
get to is the link that got you there. Instantly. This is the demon of
analogy. It leads, in a very provocative argument by Corrine Calice in our
discussion group, to the possibility of "magic thinking" in web
environments. To posit a thing is to have it, etc. A link to content as
content.

So what is "beyond analogy"? Looking at web poetry, first of all one finds
a baseline position that is defined, initially, by the hyperlink. This
becomes more complicated--in work by mez and Talan Memmott as standout
instances--in relations between different levels of signification, such as
word and image, that simply can't be linked by analogy. Word and image are
dissimilar in important ways. So a preliminary conclusions is that much of
what is going on at the interface between word and image escapes the demon
of analogy, even as it might be seduced by it.

The final horizon, for me, however is when the disanalogy is pushed to the
limit of critical reflection. I see this in Giselle Beiguelman's site "The
Book After the Book," and think the point of a lot of the complexity out
there is precisely to avoid resting in analogy. Patrick Herron's project
does this as well. And that's where I'd like to leave the discussion for
now, inviting response.

Thanks, Barrett

could not Dubya be the figure-head author of this
poem? what about the speech writer - after all -
the speech-writer came up with the original words
- if you can call them original, or even words
(if by words we mean carried-units-of-meaning
[and this is why i am a poet for the same reason
i take the bus and will never be a mechanic])

another wrinkle in pomo notions of authorship and
authority when every word penned by our political
leaders is written by committee and run past
market focus groups - i work in market research -
and let me tell you if you do not already know -
never ever EVER trust a poll - if you knew what
people were like when you lied to them and told
them it would only take 5 minutes and a half-hour
later you were still asking inane questions that
seem just like the ones you just asked 10 minutes
ago you would know - POLLS ARE A LIE! (and this
is one of the tools our government uses to check
our pulse) [as a sidenote - having nothing to do
with the discussion at hand - there was actually
a poll that asked people if they thought that
Cheeze Wiz was "outgoing"! consider it a credit
to human intelligence that the statisticians take
these things seriously while the people on the
other end of the line answering the questions
usually laugh and ask who writes this stupidity]

could Dubya be a Whitmanesque being - containing
not only America, but the speechwriters notions
of America as well?

I love the opening line "I" - who is the
political "I"? does Dubya truly believe the past
is over - or does he merely wish it so because he
is following a president who for whatever faults
had 2 successful terms in office (the country
didn't blow up, what more can you ask for?)-
didn't the Red Guard believe the past was over,
too? don't most despots?

not only is he Democratic - he is green as well -
he wants us to co-exist with the fish - which is
true, humans and fish have one thing in common -
both are becoming increasingly inedible from all
the crap we are putting in the oceans and air and
soil

"How many hands have I shaked?"

Truly, by using inanely bad grammar Dubya becomes
ONE OF US - Misunderestimate! egads - someone
call the offices of the OED - we have spotted a
new word and it's a doozie!

Of course I am a foreigner - a Canadian - tho i
think it can be agreed by all that Canadians are
Honourary (or Honorary) Americans - as is the
rest of the world (come to think of it, most
Americans are honourary Americans too)so my take
on this doesn't really matter - we have problems
of our own (Quebec, hospital closings, Mounties
who decide not to pursue investigations against
our Right Honourable Jean Poutine [a loonie to
the first yank on the List who can name the
Canadian PM off the top of their head] and
Chancellor Mike Harris)

i'd like to see someone make a poem from the
campaign promises of the two opposing parties -
would anyone be able to tell who wrote what? i
doubt it

my most traumatic memory as a child was when i
was in a baseball game in kindergarten - i was at
the plate and *thwap!' my young arm sent that
ball flying and i ran those bases like Roberto
Allomar - too bad the kid on first base just kind
of stood there like an idiot and didn't run - so
the homerun didn't count - and i was the last one
picked ever after for any baseball teams

sometimes - i think that it was a lil' Georgie
Dubya standing there - maybe that's the Major
League at the last line of the poem?

it's a working theory anyway

I think we all agree,

This is still a dangerous world.
It's a world of madmen

They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg

=== David Hess has Frienemies ===
A review of recent books by K. Silem Mohammad and Nada Gordon

(excerpt) "I ask again: Is the poetry strong or weak enough to let us know
what kind of world we inhabit - assuming, as I do, that the poet can still
speak from, or rather to, a position of universality, at least within his
or her culture? Or is the work formally cunning enough to achieve autonomy
in order to escape 'representing' the world as it exists, and so, through
its profound armor/artifice, speak to our world and its historical
moment?"


=== Linh Dinh reports from Saigon ===
Regarding translator Cu An Hung

(excerpt) "Hung has a deep appreciation for American literature. American
culture, good and bad, invaded South Vietnam during the war. Along with
The
Carpenters and Elizabeth Taylor, Vietnamese were also exposed to Allen
Ginsberg and James Dean. Hung would make the round of the used bookstores
to buy American books. "GI's threw these books away," he said, "or maybe
their housekeepers stole them. There was a lot of junk but there were also
many good books."  Hung marveled at the fact that an ordinary American
soldier would read, for example, Donald Allen's _The New American
Poetry_."


=== Dale Smith reads Las Vegas ===

A republished reading report, circa winter 1996

(excerpt) "We had been invited to read poetry in the Jewel Box Room of the
Las Vegas Public Library. Katie moved to Vegas from SF in January to learn
poker from her brother. She established a reading series to help pass the
time outside casinos. Anselm politely dealt with his lack of sleep, while
Hoa and I whined for coffee. We finally had some half an hour before the
reading in a strange, timeless funk, where I couldn't distinguish one hour
from the next. There was no day or night, only inside or outside, so
there,
through big Starbucks windows, streamed the desert's winter light. We were
outside and it was weird."


=== Considering Robert Duncan's Take on Wagadu ===

by Dale Smith

(excerpt) "The alienating ironies of our monotheistic Empire, a global
regime of Moolah, forms in Wagadu's shadow, and since at least 1945 has
been the dominate understanding of the "communal consciousness." Some
digging is required to retrieve the great city, and an extension of the
affections after Pound's own great failure is required of poets now.
America as an African, Asian, Indigenous, European promise is a garden and
a wasteland, a refuge and a killing ground. It extends by each successive
generation a failure, a promise, a refuse dump. Americans live in exile,
Wagadu only an idea here. Poets like plants grow by virtue of their
roots."

I'm not sure how you deduce that a number has "no precise numerical value"
from the fact that it is transcendental. That pi is transcendental merely
means that it cannot be the solution to any polynomial equation in one
variable having integral coefficients.

By the phrase "no precise numerical value" do you mean to suggest a random
component?

The idea that in a random sequence every digit should appear equally often
over a large enough sample was used to refute one calculation of pi to a
very large number of significant figures. Interesting to model a sequence,
any digit of which can be exactly calculated, as random.

I'd be interested in knowing what you intend by the above phrase.

Having just received a message about the virus [worm] Pretty Park
that warns "it will erase your whole 'C' drive," I thought it might
be useful to remind all Listafarians that extensive catalogs of known
viri and worms are available online, and that it's a good idea to
check any virus warnings sent to you by email against the contents
of those catalogs Before sending them on to friends + strangers.
My favorite resource is the Symantec AntiVirus Research Center
[i.e., SARC] Online Encyclopedia at

     <http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/vinfodb.html>

In this case, one finds that, while PrettyPark.Worm does indeed
exist - and is indeed quite common - that, being a worm, it does
very little damage to host computers and is easy to be rid of.
That said, still I can't urge all of you enough to use virus
protection software - and trust me, rubber gloves ain't the ticket -
on any computer that is used to access the internet.

Over World Protests, Taliban Are Destroying Ancient Buddhas

     _________________________________________________________________

     N EW DELHI, March 3 The Great Buddhas of Bamiyan priceless
     artifacts that 800 years ago survived the wrathful cannon fire of
     Genghis Khan are being steadfastly destroyed bit by bit with
     hammers, spades and explosives, Afghanistan's Taliban militia
     stated officially today for the first time.

     "The head and legs of the Buddha statues in Bamiyan were destroyed
     yesterday," Mawlawi Qudratullah Jamal, the Taliban's minister of
     information and culture, told reporters in Kabul, Afghanistan's
     capital. "Our soldiers are working hard to demolish the remaining
     parts. They will come down soon." He said he anticipated no
     difficulties: "It is easier to destroy than to build."

     Last Monday, Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader,
     issued a surprise edict that ordered the destruction of all
     statues. "These idols have been gods of the infidels," declared the
     mullah, a one-eyed recluse who is better known in Afghanistan as
     Amir-ul Momineen, the commander of the faithful.

     The Taliban, who practice a stern interpretation of Islam, have
     controlled most of the nation since 1996 and hold about 90 percent
     now. They have become notorious for many of their dictums, among
     them the head-to-toe sheathing of women, the refusal to provide
     education for girls, and the imprisonment of men who trim their
     beards.

     But until this week, statuary had been spared.

     "It is not a big issue," Mr. Jamal said today of the ban. "The
     statues are objects only made of mud or stone." But most of the
     world has reacted otherwise.

     Afghanistan has been a crossroads of Europe, India and China. Great
     conquerors have come through its mountains, as have traders, ideas
     and religions. Islam supplanted Buddhism more than 1,000 years ago.

     While most of Afghanistan's art treasures have been looted over the
     years, many objects of value remain. Certainly, no one has been
     able to carry off the towering Buddhas of the city of Bamiyan,
     which is about 90 miles west of Kabul. The mammoth figures are hewn
     from sandstone and embedded in a cliff.

     One is 175 feet high, the other 120 feet. Both are at least 1,500
     years old, and are considered among the greatest pieces of early
     Buddhist art.

     After Mullah Omar's announcement, people from all over the world
     have been arguing for the statuary's reprieve. Preservationists
     have voiced outrage, museums have made offers. Buddhists have
     pleaded for religious tolerance.

     Muslims have argued that the Taliban are mistaken in their narrow
     interpretations of the Koran.

     Today, Mr. Jamal, the information minister, effectively told the
     world to mind its own business. However much the uproar, the
     "implementation of the decree will not be delayed," he said.
     Besides, the world "knows that they cannot have a say in this"
     because other nations are "not kind" to Afghanistan.

     Indeed, only three countries Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United
     Arab Emirates recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government.

     But even these three have been disapproving this past week.
     Pakistan has protested the decree. Unesco's Arab group, which
     includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has described
     the demolition plans as "savage."

     A special representative of Unesco, Pierre Lafrance, met with the
     Taliban's ambassador in Pakistan today and was quoted as saying
     afterwards he saw "a glimmer of hope." He hopes to go to
     Afghanistan on Sunday.

     Accompanying the world's outrage is its puzzlement.

     The Taliban crave recognition. But instead of acknowledgment from
     the United Nations, the Taliban have received sanctions, in part as
     punishment for hospitality given to the alleged terrorist Osama bin
     Laden.

     In recent weeks, however, the Taliban had taken a remarkable step
     to get out of the dog house. Mullah Omar banned the growing of
     poppies, used in making heroin. Afghanistan is the largest poppy
     producer and the Taliban's tax on it is a major source of income.

     Though the commander of the faithful had issued similar decrees
     before, this one seemed accompanied by the Taliban's enforcement.
     Drug control officers for the United Nations have reported that the
     poppy yield has been virtually eliminated.

     The sacrifice of the poppy crop was no small thing. The timing
     could not have been worse for Afghan farmers, many of whom have
     already left their land because of a catastrophic three-year
     drought. More than 700,000 Afghans have left their home since the
     fall, according to aid groups. Nearly a million people are at risk
     of starvation, according to the United Nations.

     Afghanistan badly needs help, and the Taliban have been making
     appeals. However, the destruction of irreplaceable religious relics
     would hardly seem to enhance sympathy.

     "What kind of people would destroy the heritage of mankind?" asked
     Rakhaldas Sengupta, 75, a retired archaeologist in New Delhi.

     In 1969, he became head of an Indo- Afghan team to restore the
     Great Buddhas of Bamiyan. They were crumbling from age. And, over
     the centuries, they had taken substantial abuse. The Mongol
     conqueror Genghis Khan ordered a cannon attack.

     "One of the Buddhas suffered a broken right leg below the knee and
     took a shot to the left leg up to the thigh," Mr. Sengupta said.

     In the 17th century, the Moghul emperor Aurangzeb ordered an attack
     on the Buddhas. "Parts of the wooden frame were burned, and there
     was damage to the upper part of the face and the lower lip and the
     hands," Mr. Sengupta said.

     In 1998, according to Ahmed Rashid, an author and an expert on the
     Taliban, just after occupying Bamiyan, they blew the face off the
     smaller Buddha with dynamite and fired rockets into its groin.

     "The Buddhas have lived through great damage and still survived,"
     said Mr. Sengupta. "Some things can be restored. But if they are
     brought down in chunks and then ground into bits, what will be
     there left to do?"

I just found out I will get to spend the weekend of March 16-19 in San
Francisco, one of my very favorite cities.  But I haven't been there in a
few years, and the times I was there I wasn't really in the poetry world,
so I'd love any advice on book stores (I know about City Lights and Green
Apple and all the amazing ones in Berkeley, but others that are
must-gos?), poetry readings, or any tips at all about visiting.  I've
heard that the dot coms have really changed the feel of the city -- I hope
that isn't too true.

Backchanneling me would be great.

Thanks!
Arielle

I never returned to

I went through a door in the East River,
the stairs led me up into the air,
and I disappeared

And someone

my needlework.

Widening of Old-Time Campfire Audience
Means Cowboy Poets Must Clean Up Acts

March 5, 2001



By JIM CARLTON
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

ELKO, Nev. -- Waddie Mitchell is a rough-hewn wrangler, but when he recites
his cowboy poetry, he has to make sure not to offend anyone. He found that
out from the cat lovers.

Some time back at a cowboy-poetry gathering, he was reciting a typically
rowdy cowboy poem titled "Cat'astrophy," a little yarn about a cowboy who
straps dynamite to a pesky cat. "I was left with no recourse, I would use
deadly force, That kitty cat just had to die," the poem goes. The cat
ditches the explosives in the cowboy's cabin, blowing it to smithereens as
the cat scampers safely away.

Cat lovers in the audience were horrified. "They came up to me and said,
'How dare you?' " recalls the 50-year-old Mr. Mitchell, wearing his big
sombrero and twisting his handlebar mustache. "So I quit reciting it."

The modern-day cowpoke poet may look and sound a lot like his storied
19th-century forebears, but as his words now reach a mainstream audience,
he's running smack into the middle of 21st-century sensitivities. So while
cowboy poetry is more popular now -- there are more than 200 cowboy-poetry
festivals each year -- the old outhouse humor and ribaldry are out.

"Cowboys like us are chauvinist pigs," says Baxter Black, known to millions
for his cowboy recitations on National Public Radio. And, he says, some
traditional cowpoke humor doesn't go over very well with today's audiences.
So, as he plans his presentations, Mr. Black divides his audience into
"generic" and "cowy." "There are a lot of things that are too cowy to run on
National Public Radio, like talking about cow poop too much," Mr. Black
says. "For example, I can have someone slip in poop, but not have someone
slapped in the face with it."

Riling the Vegetarians

Mr. Black recalls being invited to recite for a group of vegetarians
concerned about animal rights. He tried to poke a little good-natured fun at
the crowd. "I started talking about a guy eating his salad and noticing the
tomatoes wincing in fear," Mr. Black recalls. "One lady got up and left."

During the great cattle drives of the late 19th century, cowboys picked up
the habit of writing light verse to recite around the campfire. Often the
poetry passed down over the years had racy themes. A recent compilation of
ribald cowboy poems and songs going back to the 1800s is titled "The
Whorehouse Bells Were Ringing."

In 1985, Messrs. Black and Mitchell performed in the first so-called Cowboy
Poetry Gathering, recently held for the 17th straight year in this
high-desert outpost between Reno and Salt Lake City. At first, organizers
were more worried about whether anybody would show up than about whether
anyone would take offense. The 1,000 who turned out in '85 were mostly
fellow cattlemen who could relate to frequent scatological and off-color
references. The coarseness of old cowboy poetry wasn't entirely gratuitous:
It came from real life as a cowboy. "You're standing there minding your own
business," says the 56-year-old Mr. Black, a former livestock veterinarian
from Arizona, "and the next thing you know the cow is peeing on you and the
horse is biting your butt."

The arcane art form gained a world-wide following after Messrs. Black,
Mitchell and others were featured on the "Tonight Show" and began reciting
at venues like New York's Lincoln Center and even at the Super Bowl pregame
banquet in 1996. There, Mr. Mitchell recited a poem written for the occasion
called "The Game" ("They're gargantuan-looking monsters in their helmets and
their pads, Like the gene pools went awry between their mothers and their
dads").

Cowboy-poetry festivals sprang up all across the land, and eventually the
top poets were commanding headliners' fees of as much as $8,000, with their
books selling in the hundreds of thousands. Mr. Mitchell regularly performs
at conventions of FBI personnel. About two dozen cowboy poets have gained
large enough followings to give up real cowboy work. Hundreds of others
aspire to poetic greatness.

"People from all walks of life like it because cowboy poetry is a romantic
dream of a simpler time," says Michael Marks, a coordinator for the Cowboy
Poetry and Music Festival in Santa Clarita, Calif.

A wider audience means more folks to offend. Rodeo cowboy Paul Zarzyski
recalls getting complaints from attendees at one performance of his poem
"April Showers," an account of how a show horse soaked its audience. "To be
honest with you, I think you're going to offend someone no matter what you
do," says the 49-year-old Mr. Zarzyski, who lives in Great Falls, Mont.

Cowpunchers have other reasons to clean up their acts if they hope to
perform at poetry confabs. In designating Elko's annual event the National
Cowboy Poetry Gathering last year, for instance, the U.S. Senate noted in
its resolution that the forum helps bridge the gap between city and country
people "in a humane and nonpolitical manner."

Anticipating that controversy might short-circuit their popularity, cowboy
poets, along with the singers who perform at these gatherings, held a
meeting soon after the first Elko festival to discuss the possibility of
sanitizing their stuff. "I said, 'Wait a minute, if we do that, there won't
be any color. It'll be just gray.' " recalls cowboy poet Wally McRae, a
rancher from Forsyth, Mont., who attended the meeting.

Officials of the Western Folklife Center, which puts on the Elko poetry
festival, opted to let judgment and peer pressure be the entertainers'
guide. The outhouse jokes from some of the early gatherings had faded anyway
because audiences and fellow poets had quit laughing. "People just got tired
of it," says Debbie Fant, program coordinator for the Elko gathering. On the
other hand, Mr. McRae says he has been vilified by fellow cowboys for his
outspokenness in behalf of the environment. With ranching and other resource
industries under assault by environmentalists all across the West, Mr.
McRae's recent ditty attacking coal and uranium mines was greeted with grim
silence by many cowboys in the audience. It starts off as a square-dance
call, with Mr. McRae speaking so fast that the clapping, foot-stomping
audience can't follow the lyrics at first: "Hmm, hmm uranium, Oh hear them
Geigers rattle, This Beats the hell any old day, Them days with Longhorn
cattle."

"But when they figure it out, they get quiet real quick," says the
64-year-old Mr. McRae, decked out in his red boots and black cowboy hat.

Mr. McRae doesn't shy away from trouble. His recent recitation of a poem
called "A Woman's Place" drew hisses and boos from women in the audience.
The lines included this: "A woman's place is in the home, That has always
made sense, They're just not built for riding broncs, and fixing a
barbed-wire fence." He says the sexism was actually a ploy to build tension
in the audience, as the poem goes on to say that a woman can perform cowboy
chores just as well as a man can.

Indeed, the few women on the poetry circuit say they mostly are supported by
the men and even find the genre liberating in contrast to other parts of the
entertainment business. Cowgirl singer Joni Harms, for instance, says she
left the Nashville music scene about five years ago because on the poetry
tour she can express herself without what she calls a stifling marketing
machine. "All the artistic part of Nashville is gone now," says Ms. Harms, a
rancher from Canby, Ore.

And some cowboy poets still allow a hint of the old lack of sensitivity. As
the Elko jamboree got under way amid snow flurries in late January, Mr.
Mitchell, an Elko resident and longtime cowboy here, peered out at the crowd
of about 200. Seeing many friends in attendance at the G Three Bar Theater,
he hooked thumbs in his jeans and launched into a poem that might have
ruffled feathers elsewhere:

"As I awoke this morning,
A new day had just been dawned.
A robin perched upon my sill,
To signal the coming dawn.
His songs were gay and cheerful,
And he broke the morning's lull.
Then I slammed the window shut,
And smashed his little skull."

Here are some URLs for things that I've found interesting and highly unusual
over the past few months.  The first is from William Poundstone, who, like
Finlay, has taken a deep interest in the neo-classical emblem as a way of
extending "concrete" or visual poetries bounderies beyond some sort of
one-liner.  He is, to me, very interesting because he has none of the
trappings of the "postmodern", and yet has a very contemporary, not to
mention strange, sensibility:

At ubu (these are not the "emblems"):
http://www.ubu.com/feature/contemp/feature_poundstone.html

His own site:
http://www.williampoundstone.net/

And for something completely different, here is a the rapidly getting very
famous "All Your Base Belong To Us," which is not in itself really "poetry"
but is, in fact, collaborative and text-based, and the sensibility is very
youthful -- aggressive, anarchic, expansive (whatever you might mean by
"youthful") -- not to mention techno-savvy.  When you get to this site,
click "Video 1" in the left frame, then choose which server you want to use:

http://www.planetstarseige.com/allyourbase/

Here's a very funny, and quite sophisticated in terms of timing (as Brendan
wrote earlier, timing/time is one of the things you can control quite well
with Flash), one that is also a quick download.  This may actually be from
Korea!  (It's in English, don't worry.)

http://www.yhchang.com/struggle.html

This one's not exactly a classic, but it's a fairly accurate translation of
classic "concrete" (specifically South American) aesthetics into Flash
animation.  Much more successful than, say, August de Campos's attempts to
translate his print work into Flash. It's not quite working correctly now on
my Mac -- I'll have to write to Kenny G about it -- but here's the URL:

http://www.ubu.com/feature/contemp/feature_strano.html

I don't know if you've all seen "Basho's Frogger," but it's a very very deep
philosophical metaphor based on the video game, and I think a bpNichol
translation of Basho.  It was programmed in Java by Neil Hennessey, who does
a lot of work with linguistics and a sort of "artificial life" for word
creation (some principle called a "Markov" generator).  Again, perhaps not
"poetry," but a highly conceptual art form using language, though I'm not
sure if the implications of his work (or of "Closed") are fully realized in
the Jabber piece, but it's useful for text generation.

http://www.ubu.com/feature/contemp/feature_hennessy.html

Here are two I've posted before which don't use language but use "signs" in
a syntatactical way -- classic sites:

http://www.thesquarerootof-1.com/
http://www.turux.org

Here's an oldie that I still think quite interesting if not as fresh as it
once seemed, from Juliet Ann Martin (other stuff at her site also worth
looking into):

http://www.julietmartin.com/oooxxxooo/Answer.html

And I'm sure you've checked out Kenny Goldsmith's Fidget.  This one is
beautiful to have running in the background, perhaps on a large screen on
one of your dining room walls (for those of you with dining rooms).  I get
antsy watching it for too long behind my desk (the book form is a great
read), but it's technically quite marvellous:

http://www.chbooks.com/online/fidget/applet.html


***

By the way, does anyone have a really good collection of Matthew
Kirschenbaum URLs?  I used to be able to find his essays, but they've either
been taken down or I'm just going a little wonkers.  He's written some of
the best stuff on net poetry, I feel, though I'm no authority.

easily preventable disease, and almost twice that many women will die or
suffer serious disability in pregnancy or childbirth for lack of simple
remedies and care.
UNICEF estimates that to overcome such tragedies, and to ensure basic social
services, would require a quarter of the annual military spending of the
'developing countries,' about 10 percent of U.S. military spending. It is
against
the background of such realities as these that any serious discussion of
human freedom should proceed."

deciphering works, and more on what sorts of communities works encourage."
Starting with early American writers such as Hutchinson, Dickinson, and
Douglass and continuing into the present via Stein, Hejinian, Andrews,  Hak
Kyung Cha, and Mullen, Spahr outlines a continuum of "textual liberation,"
which includes "identificatory moments" as well as the "non-identificatory:
moments when one realizes the limits of one's knowledge; moments of partial
or qualified identification; moments when one realizes and respects
unlikeness; moments when one connects with other readers (instead of

Here's the opening page --

Brian Kim Stefans: Veronica Forrest-Thomson and High Artifice

One of the misfortunes of the lack of attention being paid to English=20
poetry of this century is the obscurity of Veronica Forrest-Thomson, a poet=
=20
who died in 1975 at the age of 27. Forrest-Thomson is the author of Poetic=
=20
Artifice, a book that outlined a theory of poetry from a critical=20
perspective =97 i.e. a tool to determine the success or failure of a poem=20
rather then merely a vocabulary for describing the phenomenon of a "poem" =
=97=20
but one which, rather than confirming or resisting a "tradition,"=20
concentrated on those elements of the poem that resist quick interpretation=
=20
or, in her terms, "naturalization" by the reader or critic.

Though Poetic Artifice adheres to the conventions of a text that can be=20
re-used by members of the academy, there are moments when Forrest-Thomson's=
=20
skill as an experimental poet, along with her occasional wit, lift the=20
writing and theory itself beyond the level of disinterested speculation,=20
engaging the reader =97 should the reader be a poet =97 in what is serious=
=20
shop-talk.

Written in the early seventies, at a time when the avant-garde poetry scene=
=20
in England was still on the defensive against the Movement writers and was,=
=20
it appears, lacking unity, the book has an wide range of characters;=20
Shakespeare, Swinburne, Pound, Eliot, William Empson, Sylvia Plath, Ted=20
Hughes, Philip Larkin, John Ashbery, J.H. Prynne, and the critic/poet=20
Stephen Bann (representing the "concrete" poets), among others, come under=
=20
consideration. This is a mix that one would not find in any American book=20
of theory by a poet, probably because the United States has not had a=20
mainstream poet who has dominated the scene in the way that Ted Hughes or=20
Philip Larkin, at that time, did. When there was one, like Robert Lowell,=20
experimental poets either ignored him or ridiculed the premises of his or=20
her work with little specific analysis of their poems, as if they weren't=20
poems at all.

Forrest-Thomson doesn't demonstrate this partisanship which often turns=20
thoughtful considerations of poetry into declarations of independence;=20
consequently, her theory is given cogency by a very apparent love of=20
"traditional" poetry and her own positioning of herself as critic and=20
latecomer, despite the urgencies she felt as a poet.

Hello all --

I'm trying to track down a copy of Michael Palmer's "Blake's Newton,"
published by Black Sparrow in 1972. There seem to be a few pricey limited
edition (signed/numbered/etc.) copies available online, but I'm wondering if
anyone out there happens to know of a more reasonably priced reading copy of
the paperbound edition?

Thanks in advance.

You might try searching an academic library's online
'card catalogue' &, if you find a copy, request it
through interlibrary loan at your local (or college)

Here, now, is an interesting proposition. It's obvious there are conventions
to the Poetry Reading, perhaps - through the grammar-school educations of
such
as Yeats - going back as far as nineteenth [and thence to 17th] century
English
elocutionary discipline; Or, since no one actually reads like Yeats - except
Pound, though I've always meant to learn the trick, myself - at least back
to
the New American Poetry. Of course, we have less wine and dope now-a-days,
but
it's not for a lack of industry, I'm sure. But what are the conventions?

Well, a few of the basics would be:

1. Single reader or multiple readers once sequentially, in which case
roughly
junior to senior poet. Those of us 'Buffalonians' who read in Cuba last
January
were surprised to find this wasn't the case with the Cuban poets: rather,
they
read in two rounds. The first was generally of short, energetic poems; the
second
generally longer poems or a single long poem. It was an interesting
structure and,
it seemed, much more dialogic - not least because no one of the poets
missed out
of sheer nervousness all the others' reading.

2. Poetry readings ought to take place in a locale dedicated to some other
use: e.g.,
a gallery, bar, artist's studio, or apartment. Poetry reading = like
infestation by
ants an invasive invention. I recall once, in my bourgeois girlhood,
watching ants
enter the house by crawling along an electric cable joined to the lights in
our back
yard. I suppose we're much like that, except that we pay for our drinks.
Most of us do.

3. Begin with announcements and introduction. It will be tiresome if it is
too long,
but discourteous to the reader if too short. List publications etcetera or
give momentary
notice to What Is At Work in the reader's poems. Don't quote, or quote
heavily. Make an
introduction composed entirely of quotations from the reader's work. The
Anti-introduction
is as tedious as the real thing. Readers, say "Thank you for that [lovely]
introduction."

4. Cash bar.

5. Typically, poems are read in the high style or in 'no particular style'
- that's
what I suspect it would be called, if one were to name it. 'High' being not
Audenesque
but an emotive style with uplifted tone at the end of each line - like a
question? Please
stay behind the podium, or stand tensed but unmoving as you read. Give
anecdotes between
poems to amuse and clarify. For this style, let there be periodic 'OH's
from the audience,
responses whose actual stimulus at times will remain unclear. 'No
particular style' then
would be without affect, but not in so skilled a manner as Ashbery. Here,
there should
be some movement of the body, perhaps a nervous - or rhythmic? - back and
forth motion;
alternately, hands should hang limply at your sides. Don't look to the
audience, they
can't help you. Stay calm. Do not try to communicate with them. For this
style, let
there be periodic chuckles from the audience, responses whose actual
stimulus at
times will remain unclear.

6. Head back to the bar or go straight to the restroom in the 10-minute
break between
readers. You have 25 minutes. Find out where everyone is going afterward.
If you are
from out of town, survey the crowd to see who you want to talk with at the
next bar;
alternately, cruise. No, I don't mean "leave."

7. The first reader has the advantage of a fresh audience and will "get it
over with."
Read for no more than 25 minutes. If you have forgotten your watch, ask
periodically
"How am I doing on time?" The second reader takes her chances: a relaxed
audience, or
just bored from that first guy?

Healy etal. I'm not a mathematician and was quoting from memory from a book
about mathematics. If you are a mathematician you know that e, ln of 1 etc
are transcendental mumbers which means simply that they, well, to repeat:
"have no precise numerical value". Every man woman etc and their dog knows
that pi 3.1415927.... continues in the decimal part forever so it CANT have
a precise value. Were that not so, it doesnt alter the fact that it is
impossible to make exact measurements of anything: I know that from my
Telecommunications/Electronics background. Of course, in measurement, for
most purposes, we can get a good useable value eg for temperature and so on.
If one was taking observations of star positions (this example comes from J
Bronowski's "The Ascent of Man" error creeps in).  But refer to Bronowski's
book. I'm not saying that pi is a random number...of course it can be
calculated if you spend the rest of eternity in that fascinating occupation!
Obviously for practical reasons it cant ever be computed. And who would want
to. Its like old Richard Dawkins hinting that scientists can find
"everything out" (well he implies that in "Unweaving the Rainbow". If they
could then the world would be quite a dull place. Also the knowee of
everything would be rather at a loss as to what to do with all that
knowledge! In fact its impossible for anything at all to ever know
everything. God (Himself/herself/iteself?) would have to know that he knew
that he knew how he got to know what he knew even if he could
remember....but then it (the state of omniscience) would like " knowing
evrything is the same as knowing nothing".(And vica versa).
 I'm NOT a card-carrying postmodernist or whatever so you can forget about
doing a "Higher..Superstition" al la Gross and Levitt on me. As to
"intruding" on science: scientists and mathematicians are always imposing on
philosophy, religion and all the other humanities. I'm not anti-science but
I'm not overawed by mathematicians or scientists' ability to solve all the
problems of the world (let alone the universe as some of their subset
claim).
  If you are intersested in my "claims" etc I'd be interested in your
detailed explanation  or "claims" on or of  Blake's works (and their
"precise?" "meaning") and his influence via Huxley and the pop group The
Doors of trends in modernist and postmodernist cultures. Thus also the "flow
on effect" into (via Romanticism and by implication Classicism) the Beat
writers, the old and new NY Schools (with reference to Valery, Reverdy etc
as well as surealism via Raymond Rousell on Ashbery and Frank O'Hara, the
Ern Malley affair in Australia, Witter Bynner, the Black Mountain School and
Bukowski versus Zukofsy ( and (with some reference to Lorine Niedecker's
poem "Darwin")) Elizabeth Bishop, M Moore, Stein etal and the impact all or
some of this has had on the language poetry movement and the current
reaction to the same and  there Marxist, Derridean , Jakobsonian, and
Barthesian influence perhaps opposing (or non opposing) it to Wittgenstein,
Bertrand Russell, Whitehead, the Logical Positivists; and some "slant" from
the works of Williams Carlos Williams, Creeley, Jack Spicer, Ginzberg, Ezra
Pound and more latterly Sillliman, Bernstein, (and other writers in "In The
American Tree") Tom Raworth (possibly versus Geoffrey Hill and to a lesser
extent such "modernists" as Philip Larkin)..you could make reference to
Adorno, Benjamin and even the Australian theorist John Docker....)
       By the way: how can a polynomial equation have a "precise" solution
if what one is trying to find is, by definition, (a) "variable"? Impossible.

no, unfortunately, but i'd be interested in reading and or contributing to
such a monster as you describe.  there are bits and pieces here and there
but they generally come from one perspective or another.  to publishers or
epublishers out there - now would be a good time to untertake such a project
before some of these things stop their activities.

Richard is quite right in pointing to the presence of this sort of racism in
Australia as well as New Zealand, and in locating it in those sections of
society, urban and rural, who are 'the losers' - to use his term. But he
then makes a huge and unwarranted leap in laying the responsibility for this
with people who live in poverty not because of their own failure but because
of forces beyond their control - anyone could compile the appropriate list
here. The point seems so obvious to be hardly worth making - workers are not
unemployed because they are no good, farmers are not going broke because
they are inadequate, country towns all over Australia are not experiencing
recession because they're inhabited by people who have brought a loss of
services on themselves.

I don't support, in any form, the racism many in these groups are now having
recourse to but this reaction on the part of groups who feel betrayed by
politicians and business shouldn't blind us to some real grievances.

best,

Hello Barrett, UBPOers,

Barrett's posts are preceded with one '>'.

>The context of my question--on the early, even premature, analogizing of
hypertext with most variants of poststructuralist decentering of authorship,
narrativity, and content--was a preliminary presentation I gave at Wayne
State last Thursday on the relation between radical forms that preceded the
internet and what has come since. The posts I received from
many--particularly Carolyn Guertin offline and Patrick Herron both on and
off--were enormously helpful in beginning to construct a bibliography of
sites and to organize the information (in ways that, importantly, are
suggested by the nature of the information). I'm continuing to work on that
bibliography (which is not complete enough to show yet, but I hope will
eventually be), and so continue to seek links.


I wish to add debris as an excellent & exemplary link.
http://www.debris.org.uk/  this site i think exemplifies some tangential
aspects of what i have attempted to describe, and builds upon it.  simple
design.  issues of the disappearing self.  reduced/eliminated interactivity.
other aspects of text.



>Opening some questions this way leads immediately to: what kind of agency
can we imagine through the new technology, if not one predicated on a kind
of prelapsarian analogy (as a counter to valorizing Napster, I would
question whether, in encouraging widespread "piracy" of copyrighted
materials, it leads to anything but unfettered consumerism and an illusion
of access rather than a critical distance from the nature of commodified
culture itself).

Napster is doing anything but advocating piracy in the legal sense.  The
legal battle is about how to redefine piracy to include the person who
records for personal use.  Personal users are just fine when it comes to VCR
releases.  But when it comes to mp3, law makers and the big dollars are
saying no way, unless we can make money off of it and make a piece.
Napster is primarily a marketing barb, a hook to get people to purchase new
music.  Sales in the music industry have responded explosively.  It does,
though, lead to a form of unfettered consumerism, albeit one on the borders
of art and money.  it does also, as you crucially point out, THE ILLUSION OF
ACCESS.  Exactly.  What it does is help potentiate the aesthetic of the
personalized world of the internet to create a personalized and isolated
customized little room for each individual on the internet.  A corporate
divide-the-consumer-and-conquer strategy.  As you say, this is driven by the
illusion of access into something bigger, into being hip because you use
napster, etc.  Napster might be getting the headlines, but I think the
issues become more interesting when talking about free music files in the
open source community (gnutella).


>So the question of analogy would have immediate political consequences,
though that is not where we started out with the relation of "theory" to the
new technology. Charles Stivale, who writes on Deleuze and Guattari, gave a
short talk on kinds of posts in MOO spaces and the relation between posts
that adhered to the "theme" of the site (such as the poetics listserv) and
posts that digress. I'm sure you are all familiar with that tension. But the
dyad transparency (to the "theme" of the site)/opacity (digressing in posts
that disrupt the "theme") leads immediately to all kinds of parallels in the
poetry world. I am thinking particularly of the tension between
thematization and digression in the performance work of Steve Benson, its
relation between constructing a work and playfully undoing it at the same
time) as anticipating this dynamic. (And here I'd like to encourage another
look at Steve's work, from *Blue Books* on, for its simultaneity of
construction and dismantling.)

I think the simultaneity of construction and dismantlement is exactly what I
have aimed to do, to use and dismantle text, to use and dismantle
advertising language and insincere confrontationalism, to use and dismantle
the internet-user relationship, which is always being blindly pushed in
rather simple ways.  there's sincere language with noise, and language in
the noise.  and the user must be there, but s/he is also pushed away as much
as s/he is pulled in.  I'd like to see benson's work.  sounds interesting.

>The form of the essay, then, seems to be changing from being centrally
addressed to the coherence of an argument (Emerson) to be valorized for the
number and richness of links (though I haven't seen it yet, I imagine
Brian's essay to be of this nature). This is something I'd like to further
explore, then--the nature of the internet essay. What are some outstanding
or definitive instances of the genre, assuming that it is starting to turn
into one?

I think it is palimpsest, part surrealisme, using as many connexions as
possible to justify and legitimize one's own work, giving a work many
different flavors, even if there ends up not being much of a dish.  I find
this effort now to be humorous and insecure; this POV is part of a current
transition for me.  I find this style of essay you describe results in part
from the naiveté about the potentiality of the internet that I think has
been ignored for some time.  Some people think that just because a
technology is there (re: the hyperlink) it should be beaten to death or even
provide the very basis for a new form of literature.  "Some good points/some
bad points."  Some may find the good points more than the bad about making
the hyperlink the pivot for a literary revolution, and here I am trying to
counterbalance that weight by saying that such efforts are thin, naive, and
uninteresting.  And I'm not really touching the sociopolitical implications.
Yes, that little mouse click gesture and its confinement have implications,
ramifications.

I think such a type of essay as you describe may have emerged in part
because design is central to the internet and has made design an important
part of so much of creative action.  One must sort of know all of his/her
pieces s/he is about to put out on the web in order to do something that
will not annoy the crud out of people or sent them away from the site. So
essays, it seems, suddenly are being designed, strategized, laid out,
sometimes as well as web sites.  The linear argument in such essays is often
presupposed by the author to be an emergent property of the designed
sequence of text.  This does make for a more rhetorically-dependent essay,
and the rational and the logical can suffer.  A well-done essay of this
palimpsest manner rests upon the reader's intuition, the reader's actual
mindfulness and 'heartfulness,' so-to-speak, while constructing a linear
logical argument.  Such an essay must use the emotive powers of the richness
of reference (without regard to links) and de-emphasize the precision of the
analogy.

>The second point of focus was the status of the analogy. I find deeply
problematic the claim that "link" itself--the act of linking, text to
footnote, site to site, etc.--constitutes the formal foundation of the
internet.

I think it is a sideshow in some respects.  And I will explain how it does
function....

>In other words, mere rhizomic structure is not enough. Not as structure,
but for the way that there is an inference that content and link are
identical, that content is delivered *as* the link. Linking is content. So a
slogan like "where do you want to go today" implies that the place you get
to is the link that got you there. Instantly. This is the demon of analogy.
It leads, in a very provocative argument by Corrine Calice in our discussion
group, to the possibility of "magic thinking" in web environments. To posit
a thing is to have it, etc. A link to content as content.

But isn't "magic thinking" just another expression of neofascist thought
dressed in hipster techno clothing?  Those clothes ARE expensive.

>So what is "beyond analogy"? Looking at web poetry, first of all one finds
a baseline position that is defined, initially, by the hyperlink. This
becomes more complicated--in work by mez and Talan Memmott as standout
instances--in relations between different levels of signification, such as
word and image, that simply can't be linked by analogy. Word and image are
dissimilar in important ways. So a preliminary conclusions is that much of
what is going on at the interface between word and image escapes the demon
of analogy, even as it might be seduced by it.

>The final horizon, for me, however is when the disanalogy is pushed to the
limit of critical reflection. I see this in Giselle Beiguelman's site "The
Book After the Book," and think the point of a lot of the complexity out
there is precisely to avoid resting in analogy. Patrick Herron's project
does this as well. And that's where I'd like to leave the discussion for
now, inviting response.

To avoid resting in analogy.  Hmmm.  It was not my terminology, but it
expresses some of my own points quite succinctly.  Here's how I would
explain the aims of proximate with respect to text, internet, and poetry, in
your terms of analogy.

Analogy cannot be made intertextually.  It is made instead between text and
a person.  In a flash.  Pow, like magic.  Perhaps that's what people are
experiencing accidentally through using lots of hypertext.  But with
hypertext, resolution is impossible, and so all people see is the text-text
relationships THAT ARE NOT REALLY THERE.  It's all in the eye of the reader,
or, rather, it's in the tripartite (1. user 2. text/technology 3. user/text
connection) relation of text and person.  When exploring this we must
consider all three "parts".

Text has always been removed from the user.  It is a technology, a disjoint
(re: displacement) attempt at representing interpersonal speech
communication.  It also gives language users a storage device.  Stone is the
first hard drive.    (Poetry is the precursor to this static storage device,
and this could become an interesting and essential part of this analysis).
Because of this disjoint nature, because of this divide, this inherent loss
of connexion, the user is always required to invent the meaning of the text.
That moment of invention is an act of creation.  Now, it's not just
out-of-the-blue creation.  I'm not saying anything as odd as that.  The
moments of creation that happen in a user's head are limited because they
are parameterized.  They are parameterized in the text, and they are
parameterized by what the user has been instructed to expect from those
moments of creation.  As an example, imagine a text discussion of penguins.
Now, what do people mean by penguins?  Well, a reader may have gone into the
reading with previous instructions about "penguin."  Antarctic black and
white aquatic birds might be one of those parameters to "penguin".  Another
might be LINUX, the famous operating system, with its logo based upon the
aquatic bird.  Or we might be talking about Batman's nemesis.  And so on.
Now, that term is parameterized in the text containing it as well.  We might
see the words "Joker" and "Batmobile."  The word "penguin" has been
parameterized to Batman's nemesis, and this is what a reader would normally
call meaning.  It's really just a term that has expectations set about its
use, and those expectations help the reader towards the confines of the
term.

this is akin to how the brain works though semantic storage and efficient
connexion associations.  Not that we need science to justify this argument,
but science does provide another heuristic metaphor that supports what I am
saying.

This parameterization of meaning in the moment of the reader's invention of
the meaning is what I call the control of language.  For now let's avoid the
pejorative sense of "control."  The parameters act as a sort of fence that
close in on that reader's moment of creation; they give that creation a
predictable shape.  That control of language, that parameterization, is
transitively the control of language readers.  The text can act to control
people.   Depending on how the piece is authored (number of possibilities &
ambiguities set up as intratextual cues for the meanings of terms) that text
can strongly confine and dictate the meanings of the terms created by the
reader.  That is, they can push the reader and hir creations into a
well-defined space.  such writing when taken to this controlled extreme is
usually described as precise, clear, deliberate, etc.    Other writing can
pit parameter against parameter both intratextually and in the memories and
expectations of the readers, allowing or forcing the reader to invent the
meaning of such language in a completely unbridled way.  Such writing often
gets termed obscure, surreal, ambiguous, codified, or meaningless.

Let's think of this in terms of the internet and hyperlinks. A hyperlink,
the specific form of internet interactivity, is exactly a mode of
parameterization.  Quite literally.  Hypertext linking is a mode of
predefining and reducing the number of possibilities for meaning in a
reader's mind.  Such an effort, though they may help to guide users to make
certain points, deliver instruction or knowledge, etc., controls the set of
creative cognitive possibilities.  It also leaves the moment of creation in
many cases (think of interactive poetries where a click "generates" or
selects a preformed new phrase from a database of collected phrases, albeit
by chance) almost completely to machines.  The spirit is pushed out of the
user and its ghost appears in the machine.

What does this have to do with poetry?  Poetry has rather consistently
sought to find new reader inventions by both using language that is highly
unparameterized (e.g., inventing new metaphors) and also by using forms that
move people's thoughts away from the pre-established parameters either in
the text or in the reader's memory.  We know now that stutterers are
encouraged to sing if they have trouble saying something; they are
encouraged to move the locus of their linguistic activity in the brain away
from the predefined and predictably stutterful to a place where there are
non-stuttering associations, like areas in the brain for singing.  Likewise,
poetry came traditionally in the form of lyric first as a mnemonic device,
and then when certain forms of musicality weren't necessary for storage
anymore, poets try to do other unpredictable things.  They try new
techniques to keep moving the meaning of the words to another place other
than the place where the meanings are prefabricated, dictated.  Moving words
out of their fences.  Poetry, therefore, has functioned and continues to
function as a language of free subjective creativity and psychic freedom.

To sum:

Text is understood in a complex where the user interacts with the text and
invents a meaning.  what meanings are created are boundless but are bounded
by previous expectation and intratextual cues.  Hyperlinks are a form of a
parameter, a form of a limit of the reader's creative moment, and
transitively a tool of language control.  Control of language necessarily
implies control of language users.  Poetry often works as an opposing force
to the standard parameters, opening up the reader's ability to more freely
select meanings of terms and ideas, spawning previously unimagined
associations and moving the reader toward uses of text other than as a
device for control.

John etal. I enjoyed that article by Brian Stefans. I picked up "Poetic
Artifice" frm a friends s/h bokshop: I was fascinated by the mix of writers
referred to...Prynne, Pound, Ashbery. Her poems here quoted seem "better"
than what I looked at in "A Various Art" which is  a good book. Probably
with her death the world lost a major writer. Thanks for this link. Richard.

Jacket 14


List members might like to look at this recent posting to Jacket # 14, at

http://www.jacket.zip.com.au/jacket14/stefans-forrest-thomson.html

Here's the opening page --

Brian Kim Stefans: Veronica Forrest-Thomson and High Artifice

One of the misfortunes of the lack of attention being paid to English
poetry of this century is the obscurity of Veronica Forrest-Thomson, a poet
who died in 1975 at the age of 27. Forrest-Thomson is the author of Poetic
Artifice, a book that outlined a theory of poetry from a critical
perspective - i.e. a tool to determine the success or failure of a poem
rather then merely a vocabulary for describing the phenomenon of a "poem" -
but one which, rather than confirming or resisting a "tradition,"
concentrated on those elements of the poem that resist quick interpretation
or, in her terms, "naturalization" by the reader or critic.

Though Poetic Artifice adheres to the conventions of a text that can be
re-used by members of the academy, there are moments when Forrest-Thomson's
skill as an experimental poet, along with her occasional wit, lift the
writing and theory itself beyond the level of disinterested speculation,
engaging the reader - should the reader be a poet - in what is serious
shop-talk.

Written in the early seventies, at a time when the avant-garde poetry scene
in England was still on the defensive against the Movement writers and was,
it appears, lacking unity, the book has an wide range of characters;
Shakespeare, Swinburne, Pound, Eliot, William Empson, Sylvia Plath, Ted
Hughes, Philip Larkin, John Ashbery, J.H. Prynne, and the critic/poet
Stephen Bann (representing the "concrete" poets), among others, come under
consideration. This is a mix that one would not find in any American book
of theory by a poet, probably because the United States has not had a
mainstream poet who has dominated the scene in the way that Ted Hughes or
Philip Larkin, at that time, did. When there was one, like Robert Lowell,
experimental poets either ignored him or ridiculed the premises of his or
her work with little specific analysis of their poems, as if they weren't
poems at all.

Forrest-Thomson doesn't demonstrate this partisanship which often turns
thoughtful considerations of poetry into declarations of independence;
consequently, her theory is given cogency by a very apparent love of
"traditional" poetry and her own positioning of herself as critic and
latecomer, despite the urgencies she felt as a poet.

Hello all,

I'm in the process of my creative thesis which is a collection of persona
poems preceded by an introduction regarding the persona poem as a
particularly useful form in contemporary american poetry.

While I've had some success in collecting information about and samples of
these types of works, I feel that there has to be much more out there that
I've not yet found.

Any suggestions you could give as to authors, anthologies or research about
this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Denise

Kirschenbaum keeps a really extensive list of his publications and
projects on his CV at his website.  Currently he is at the University
of Kentucky; his page address is http://www.rch.uky.edu/~mgk/.
I agree, his work is very eye-opening, and open-eyed.

of course: george hartley, linda reinfeld, etc. but i see those as more
thematic studies. the historical accounts ("here's what happened, how it
happened, the key moments") have been primarily by participants so far
(perelman's book, silliman's essays). so i guess vickery's book does both
in thematizing gender issues but also going back into the historical
record to account for what was going down when...

Dear Folks,

I was not able to attend the Joe Brainard event at the UC Berkeley
Museum on Sunday 3/4 -- I am generally kept at home due to family
health problems.  Could someone write a report on the event -- Steve
Dickison, perhaps?  I'm sure others would be curious too.  Brainard's
art and his "I Remember" are very movingly silly and delightful,
always favorites, and a great crowd of Tulsa and St. Mark's laureates
was scheduled to attend.  I'm particularly curious about Dick Gallup
-- he seems to have resurfaced after many years, and I would like to
know how he is and what his work is like.

Thanks,

funder. Her poetry and essays on poetry's connection to politics, gender,
and history have appeared in many magazines and anthologies. She is a
theorist and the author of the famous essay, "Notes for an Oppositional
Poetics," which first appeared in the anthology The Politics of Poetic Form
(ed. Charles Bernstein, 1990). Anne Waldman describes Chris Tysh's book
Continuity Girl as "Bold, erudite, witty, feminist and elegantly elegiac."
Ms. Tysh, born and educated in Paris, teaches creative writing and women's
studies at Wayne State University. Her books include Secrets of Elegance,
Porne, Coat of Arms, In the Name, and Continuity Girl. Car Men, a play in d

Friday, March 9th at 7 pm
"READ MY (S)LIPS): WRITING FROM THE PLACE OF THE OTHER," A WRITING WORKSHOP
TAUGHT BY CHRIS TYSH
(See bio for March 7th reading.) What happens when a poet writes in a
language that is not her own? What does she lose by abandoning her mother
tongue? What torques does she force onto English? Chris Tysh's talk will
explore the poetic economies of writing from a place of alterity and
difference. This workshop has been made possible by a generous grant from
the Jerome Foundation. Admission to the workshop is $7, $4 for students and
seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members.

Monday, March 12th at 8 pm

Christopher Stackhouse is a poet, performer and visual artist. He performs
in the Live Session art / music happenings at CBGB's 313 Gallery and has
been a fellow of the Cave Canem writers workshop. His visual art,
represented by the Atmosphere Gallery in Chelsea, is text-based in its
conception, resulting in work that, in the artist's own words, is "an
attempt to make intellectual art that is not at first intellectual but
visceral, maverick, and simultaneously universal." Stephanie Williams is a
professional book publicist in New Orleans, Louisiana. Her work was featured
in the inaugural issue of Mungo vs. Ranger.

Wednesday, March 14th at 8 pm
JACKSON MAC LOW AND ANNE TARDOS

Jackson Mac Low is the author of twenty-eight books and has been published
in ninety anthologies. His most recent publication is 20 Forties (Zasterle
Press, 1999), which was selected from 154 Forties, 154 forty-line poems that
are in need of a publisher. "Jackson Mac Low's marvels of verbal invention
provoke nonstop streams of readerly imagination,"  writes Charles Bernstein.
Poet and visual artist Anne Tardos is the author of the multilingual
performance work Among Men, which was produced by German Radio, WDR, in
Cologne. Her books of polylingual poems and graphics include Cat Licked the
Garlic, Maygshem Fish, and Uxudo (1999), which integrates poems written in
four languages, along with invented words and digitally modified frames of a

Apologies for cross posting.

Daylight Saving Sex by  Randolph Healy, 14cm x 10.5cm, 16pp, is now
available from Wild Honey Press, 16a Ballyman Road, Bray, County Wicklow,
Ireland  (or from Peter Riley)       for USD 5 / STG 3.50

I started thinking about gardening and what a problem slugs and snails are.
A friend of mine keeps ducks in order to suppress them (the slugs and snails
not the ducks.) One species being hermaphrodite the other stridently
dimorphic, I began to think about polarities, the real and the artificial,
the moment and the aeon, the individual and the national and how they
constantly collide, often violently. The end result, a single poem, turned
out darker than I'd anticipated. But there you are.

Review copies are available.

To Mr Healy etal. It turns out that you are right re the definition of a
transcendental number...the word I needed was "irrational" (which means that
it cant be expressed as a fraction of two - integers?) - anyway, the point
is that the sequence (after the decimal point), is, as far as we can
conceive, infinite. My reference to probability was a "jump" to other ideas.
  Of course its not a random, and in a sense, as it can be, eventually,
computed...but the problem starts there: it never has and never will be: so
for every circle there are an infinite values of circle areas. But you dont
need pi for that. But pi is not like certain other constants such as
absolute zero which can be (well, I'm even dubious of this) extrapolated to
about -273 degrtees celsius or some number like that.(I'm not one of your
"numerologists" all tho I admit that numbers etc are another thing that
intrigue me). Precise, even in mathematics,engineering and science, is never
absolutely precise. How do I measure voltage? With a meter with infinite
input impedance? And what about your caesium clock...so precise ..I forget
the accuracy but it loses time, sure, over a very long time, but it does.
And where, at any point in time is any particular electron? Are there any
points in time? What is energy? How can time be created? How long is an
elephant's tail? Which wins, an immovable force or an irresistable object?
Am I a part of the set that contains myself etc etc. How did they figure pi
out in the first place? By mathamagic? Mathematics and science, as far as
"knowing" the universe ultimately, is pretty useless. So, for that matter,
probably, is religion and philosophy. Nor do I have much faith in
coordinology or Derrida etal. If we "worked it all out" what a dull place
the world would be. The scientists and boffins would be out of a job! They
might have do some real work! Heavens forbid! O me miserum! Maybe such
matters are best left to poets. Richard Taylor..

Women's Experimental Fiction: Thinking Gender in/as/through Language
Modern Language Association, New Orleans=20
December 27-30, 2001
I'm seeking paper proposals that explore the relationship between =
innovations in form and language in women's experimental fiction as a =
thinking about, or a critique of, gender.


In Subversive Intent, Susan Suleiman writes, "The avant-garde woman =
writer is doubly intolerable.because her writing escapes not one but two =
sets of expectations/ categorizations; it corresponds neither to the =
"usual revolutionary point of view" nor to the "woman's point of view." =
In her essay, "Illiterations," Christine Brooke-Rose remarks: "It seems =
to me that the combination of woman + artist + experimental means so =
much hard work and heartbreak and isolation that there must be little =
time or energy for crying out loud." This panel will investigate the =
relationship between innovations in form, language, and genre as a =
thinking about, or a critique of, gender. We will also consider how such =
poetics set women writers outside "logocentric" and "feminist" =
discourses alike. Paper topics might explore connections between gender =
and genre, marginalized aesthetics & authors, narrative as performance, =
poetics of difference/critiques of poetics of difference, the resistance =
to difficulty, and/or what terms like "innovative," "experimental," and =
"avant-garde" mean for women writers.=20

Barret etal. I see the whole thing as analogous to thinking itself: to the
mind or the brain if they are the same. There is a kind of "magic" about
thinking. how did we "think of" that word? If we plan a poem or whatever:
what precedes that which precedes....So there is the linear logical, lateral
logical, intuition, "leaps of cognition" , or "seeing" or seeing into things
etc.Like writing something original or creative, or setting out on a voyage:
one never knows, and its probably undesirable to know, exactly where if
anywhere one is going to go. Being on this Poetics list is like being inside
a poem and being thought. I become an idea, whoops, where am I? oh, I'm at
Patrick's site, now I'm reading a newspaper in Mongolia, but I think I'll go
off and write something on paper...hullo, I'm back, or is it me: who are
these people, what are these messages? Now I've made a cyber "friend" : is
he or she a friend? This screen before me is (usually) very silent: it seems
to be suspended in space or time, like a cliche. Ah! I'll go to this
link...what are these words whirling around....?
   It's like a tour that goes from a large frenetically busy city to a
beautifully quiet place. You can "go" nearly anywhere. Or you can do
nothing: refuse to press any keys or click the mouse. You can like it or
lump it. Some days you'll hate the impersonality of it: other days you'll
love it. You miss the direct contact...but then, maybe that's comforting
(stifling?): but at least your crossing vast or small distances and people
aren't prejudiced by what you look like etc But of course the old
hierarchies reassert...but it doesnt matter, its fun.We'll get back to the
theory, but for now lets coast a bit and keep an eye out for snakes or
tarantulas, or a sighting of a beautiful bird or animal. We can be cyber
Rimbauds... An interesting discussion this will be about your demon!

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

                     [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books.txt ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

        Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

New Inventions II


Introducing Thai artist TOP CHANGTRAKUL


8 March - 7 April at Lance Fung Gallery, 537 Broadway

Reception for the artist: Thursday, 8 March, 6 - 8 PM


Duchampian puns made of street find and garage sale items by Thai
artist, Top Changtrakul, are included in his first solo exhibition at
Lance Fung Gallery.

Chosen from among his class at San Francisco Art Institute, Top dazzled
his

visiting professor, Lance Fung, with a sardonic blend of Eastern and

Western cultures in fantasy fetish works parading as an archive of
"lost"

inventions.


New Inventions II displays a series of performances, videos, and
objects,

through which the public explores the world's desire for control.
=46lirts

with wishfulness, destiny, one's inner most desire, past lives,
happiness

and attainment are frustrated by Top's logic of serendipity and fate.
Irene

Violet Small says, "Issues of longing, uncertainty and access form a
major

theme of the show, and Changtrakul is most poignant in the inventions
which

sharply juxtapose a sense of scientific objectiveness with the elusive
and

seductive realm of the unknown."


A search to discover the unknown is staged as an inventor's Bangkok
studio

and in actions documented throughout Bangkok. At great expense, the
entire

site of Top's "inventor's studio;" drawings, gadgets, and lights have
been

excised and shipped from Bangkok and obsessively recreated for public

display at Lance Fung Gallery. The entire gallery space is transformed
into

an enlarged Thai outhouse in which we find televised solicitations,

testimonials, instructions, actions and many inventions with all their

successes and failings.


New Inventions II helps us to return to a timeless and playful

consciousness where past, present and future are as confused as fact,

fiction and faketion. So sit back, relax and watch as Top Changtrakul,
the

inventor of our inventor, delights us with his re-invention of
invention

itself coming up next at Lance Fung Gallery.

From

http://forum.swarthmore.edu/dr.math/faq/faq.prob.intro.html

"Irrational numbers are numbers that can be written as decimals but not as
fractions.

An irrational number is any real number that is not rational. By real number we
mean, loosely, a number that we can conceive of in this world, one with no
square roots of negative numbers (such a number is called complex.)

A real number is a number that is somewhere on a number line, so any number on a
number line that isn't a rational number is irrational. The square root of 2 is
an irrational number because it can't be written as a ratio of two integers.

Other irrational numbers include the square root of 3, the square root of 5, pi,
e, and the Golden Ratio. (For more information about pi and e, see Pi =
3.14159... and E = 2.71828..., also from the Dr. Math FAQ.)

Pi is an irrational number because it cannot be expressed as a ratio (fraction)
of two integers: it has no exact decimal equivalent, although 3.1415926 is good
enough for many applications. The square root of 2 is another irrational number
that cannot be written as a fraction.

In mathematics, a name can be used with a very precise meaning that may have
little to do with the meaning of the English word. ("Irrational" numbers are NOT
numbers that can't argue logically!)"

I agree with the rest, mostly. Measuring is just a tool - and one of the many
elements of "good science" - and nothing to get hung about. I think that Maths,
science and philosophy do a reasonable job in "knowing" the universe - after
all, they've been fairly sucessful (in comparison with other attempts) in
answering the questions we've decided to ask thus far. As you point out, there
are unanswered questions - but these questions are very large and the day is
young.

The search for ever greater accuracy may be the search for a chimera but it's a
useful one, I think. Some of the results have been spectacular.

What was the original question?

#  is that the sequence (after the decimal point), is, as far as we can
#  conceive, infinite. My reference to probability was a "jump" to other ideas.
#    Of course its not a random, and in a sense, as it can be, eventually,
#  computed...but the problem starts there: it never has and never will be: so
#  for every circle there are an infinite values of circle areas. But you dont
#  need pi for that. But pi is not like certain other constants such as
#  absolute zero which can be (well, I'm even dubious of this) extrapolated to
#  about -273 degrtees celsius or some number like that.(I'm not one of your
#  "numerologists" all tho I admit that numbers etc are another thing that
#  intrigue me). Precise, even in mathematics,engineering and science, is never
#  absolutely precise. How do I measure voltage? With a meter with infinite
#  input impedance? And what about your caesium clock...so precise ..I forget
#  the accuracy but it loses time, sure, over a very long time, but it does.
#  And where, at any point in time is any particular electron? Are there any
#  points in time? What is energy? How can time be created? How long is an
#  elephant's tail? Which wins, an immovable force or an irresistable object?
#  Am I a part of the set that contains myself etc etc. How did they figure pi
#  out in the first place? By mathamagic? Mathematics and science, as far as
#  "knowing" the universe ultimately, is pretty useless. So, for that matter,
#  probably, is religion and philosophy. Nor do I have much faith in
#  coordinology or Derrida etal. If we "worked it all out" what a dull place
#  the world would be. The scientists and boffins would be out of a job! They

Some of you may have already seen this, but here's your chance to put a poet
on a US postal stamp.

 Go to:

 http://www.poets.org/npm/nominations/Vote.cfm

 to cast your vote (and nominate any poets you feel have been left  out) for
poets to be on a 2002 stamp. [I added Charles Olson and Joe Ceravolo.]

Williams, HD, O'Hara and Stein are in the top 10. Niedecker and Spicer are
only a couple of votes from it. I'm the lone vote for Oppen thus far.

 There are certain rules (have to be dead at least 10 years, can't  have
previously had a stamp...), and you can only vote once per poet, but you can
still vote many times.

hi!
i'm not quite sure what you're ultimately getting at, richard, unless it's simply that
poets are poets for non-precision (or rather precision of non-measurement (*love* :
"knowing everything is the same as knowing nothing" as you say, lol) or is that my
interpretation/skew). but i like the discussion. immediately to mind comes heisenberg's
principle & i think you might also consider the Compensator - entanglement. i'd love to
hear where you throw that in here. it could be something to do with this 'coordinology'
mentioned in revdest's post! smiling, would really like that string followed (though of
course         unmeasured    ).

fun,
hassen

Hi Richard,

I'd be pretty much with most of what you're saying. I was just clarifying
the definition of transcendental number, nothing more. I wholeheartedly
agree that science or maths can ever give a complete understanding of the
world and very much enjoy their inconsistencies and inadequacies. It
humanises them as disciplines.

However a couple of small points, again not intended as an attack or a
defense of anything in particular.

Numbers can be defined independently of their decimal expansions, therefore
the idea that a number has an infinite expansion does not mean that they are
not precise. A trivial example would be a third. Neither is a number
identical to a measurement. Similarly, a polynomial _can_ have an exact
solution. This in no way contradicts the idea of a variable. Perhaps you are
confusing values a function may take as opposed to its roots.

However, this is all nitpicking, and I'd be the first to agree that it is of
no consequence.
Finally, pi doesn't necessarily _have_ to be defined as a ratio of lengths.
(Though those lengths can be defined in terms of line integrals rather than
physical measurements.) It has quite an active life as the period of various
functions, in the solution of all sorts of polynomials and power series and
in probability.

Many areas of mathematics are exact. Some are not. Some are riddled with
contradictions which may never be resolved. The application of mathematics
involves extraordinary leaps of faith and is never absolutely precise.

Finally, the definition of what is random is, imo, far from stable and
intersects in interesting way with irrational and transcendental numbers.

best

Randolph Healy

The Brainard tribute was a delight.  Anne Waldman opened with a spirited
reading of material by both Brainard & herself, accompanied by slides.  Bill
Berkson went next, reading some of Brainard's journal entries from the
Bolinas years--slides here as well.  Dick Gallup read some cut-ups of his
from the 60's that were interesting, but not quite optimum for public
reading.  He seemed a little shy.   Barbara Guest read from _Moscow
Mansions_.  Ron Padgett read and showed slides of an unpublished 1966
Christmas letter/comic from Brainard to him and Pat Padgett: "The Incomplete
Biography of Ron Padgett."  This included a hilarious fictionalization of
Padgett's birth in a Tulsa hospital in which his mother intervenes
heroically to prove the doctors wrong who inform her that her child is dead.
  Finally, Kenward Elmslie gave a spectacular reading from _The Champ_,
flicking through slides of Brainard's artwork at lightning speed.  There was
an intermission during which a tape of _I Remember_ played, along with a
short film which I unfortunately missed, and then the six poets sat in a
panel and fielded first the curator's then the audience's questions about
Brainard.  When asked about the collaboration process between himself,
Brainard, and Berrigan on "Bean Spasms," Padgett reassured everyone first of
all that "there was no sex involved."

The exhibit itself (which continues through May 27th) is nicely
representative, ranging from his early collages to some lovely floral
paintings to assorted comics (including the wonderful "People of the World
Relax" from _C Comix_ No. 2).  And of course several "Nancy" pieces.  There
were two slightly mildewed copies of Brainard's and Elmslie's _Baby Book_
for sale in the gift shop for $10, and I'm kicking myself for not buying
one.

Ditto. My family did not escape the US two generations back just to
remain honorary USAmericans. As refugees they were welcomed here, and

Geraldine. I cant see where I made that "huge leap". I wasnt connecting up
the racialist issue with economics etc although they are obviously somehow
connected I was pointing out that it is a world wide issue and that it was
interesting that a friend I have, who has recently returned from living for
some years in London, feels that issues of racialism, feminism, homophobia
are all pretty passe. He and I disagree, but he feels that racialism and all
the other "isms" have now become issues for various Govt Depts or pressure
groups who are actually creating an industry out of their supposed
grievances. I and he differ strongly on this.(But he may have a point or
two..)
  I dont know who's responsible for workers or anyone being unemployed etc
I suppose its partly in the hands of the individual and I've no doubt there
are other forces at work. What do you or others think? Is (or are) racialism
(or any of the other issues simply going to correct themselves as people
become better informed without the need for any positive moves or "political
correctness"? Does any of it matter? Are homosexuals and people of various
races better off because they get special grants etc? My friend feels that
"homophobia" is now not of any use as a word.  He feels everything will
right itself and that Capitalism, as long as we vote for (Labour in NZ) and
I suppose Democrat in the US etc that everything will work out well, or as
well as can be expected. He doesnt think that there is any major problems of
racialism in the US since 1970 or so and the Civil Rights and the Kennedys
"corrected" the racialism. That's HIS view, not mine. I differ, and I've no
doubt that if he was black or one of the "oppressed" groups he'd have a
different view. But he feels that everything is kapai (good) and there are
thus "no worries".  (Also he opposes Maori "radicalism" or activism here.)
  Is he right? Does any of it matter? Bit I dont see where my "huge leap"
comes in. I also commented on the way the internet was useful in conveying
info (as Allan Sondheim provided) around. People can decide for themselves.
I know about NZ but cant comment too deeply about the US or Australia.
  The Asian immigration into NZ has been used by politicians to scare
paranoid people that somehow NZ is being taken over. But it's just a variant
of Hitler's tactics re the Jews. Get a minority, hammer them, and you can
get people behind you as the majority are either stupid or ignorant and so
you can send them to war which is good for business. Something like that! Or
you jack up a war in Yugoslavia or Iraq or somewhere obscure so you keep
people thinking that armies etc are actually "useful things". Yes? No?
  Anyway your letter is a bit obscure: are you saying that Aussie farmers
are going broke because there are so many Asians in Australia they cant
cope? Or what? Australia seems to be in pretty good shape to me. My brother
reports that Townsville is very wet, and my daughters are having a great
time in Melbourne and my ex RAF uncle in Brisbane has a large family
including many grand children who havent rushed out of Australia within the
last forty years or so. Of course the working class are getting hammered,
but then if they all think like my mate (called The Ant) then undoubtedly
they'll be losing out thru sheer apathy and maybe stupidity. But then I've
never been to Australia myself...you might be able to enlighten everyone as
to what exactly it is you are talking about. Regards, Richard Taylor.

Robert Peters immediately comes to mind.  His best collection is In Shaker
Light, but see also his Kane, Blood Countess, etc.  I might also add my own
"Mr. 6"--a version of which is in The Asylum Annual for 1994.  Jesse Glass

Richard Taylor asks:

>       By the way: how can a polynomial equation have a "precise" solution
>if what one is trying to find is, by definition, (a) "variable"? Impossible.

n + 0 = 1  is a polynomial equation; so is n = 0, for that matter.  'n'
represents the variable in this equation.  The (unique, as it happens)
solution to this equation is 1; that is, when the value of n = 1, the
equation is true.  That's what it means to be a solution to an equation.
Precise enough, or were you kidding?

Teachers and Writers Collaborative's book on Forms, edited by Ron Padgett,
includes the pantoum and its definition.  I've been teaching
pantoums to high-school students (I travel around NY, teaching K-
college-adult) and tried it with high-school students; they love it.
So I tried it with my Winter Literary Workshops for Kids (ages 6-
10).  They're all addicted now, as am I.  I too would like to know of
any sites, etc.

                     *

Jane Wodening writes of her life: "When I was eleven, I gave up the human
race and took up with dogs.  This was on the occasion of the family's move
to the Colorado Rockies from a suburb of Chicago.  It was good running with
dogs.  Human language was difficult to decipher.  People never did mean what
they said and I didn't know how to reply to them....  Bored in school, I
still made good grades.  In college, I tried zoology and then engineering
math but in my sophomore year when my brother wanted a ride to New York, I
jumped at the chance to get out of academia.  In the midst of the startling
confusion of my first visit to New York, I learned what art was- opera,
classical music, great masterpieces of painting or sculpture.  I had always
read a lot, but Lawrence and Steinbeck began my grown-up reading.  Two years
later, I married an artist and we were together for thirty years.  He
introduced me to the avant-garde in every field of the arts.  I met people
whose talk or music or visual art could fly like a flock of birds around my
head.  And I could understand it, as I understood the dogs.  However, my own
speech and writing, although it uses complexities and nuances, stays fairly
straight and simple.  When the kids were grown and gone and the divorce
happened, I traveled the country in a little car....  Then I spent ten years
living in a tiny cabin at ten thousand feet elevation....  My central
obsession of that decade was writing my first major book, The Tablets.  I
also got my short stories organized into seven volumes and found small
publishers to publish them.  I did readings of my stories around the
country.  But mostly, I was there, on the mountainside, chopping wood,
watching the wildlife, getting personally involved with some of them."

Jim Cohn is the author of four books of poetry: Prairie Falcon, Grasslands,
The Dance of Yellow Lightning over the Ridge, and the soon to be published
Quien Sabe Mountain.  He has released several spoken word recordings
including The Road (featuring Steve Kimmock of Phil Lesh & Friends),
Unspoken Words (featuring the last studio recording made by Allen Ginsberg,
"Lay Down Yr Mountain," written in 1976 while on tour with Bob Dylan & the
Rolling Thunder Review) and a jazz poetry record put out last year titled
Antenna.  He has also written two books of critically useful Disability
Studies prose: Sign Mind: Studies in American Sign Language Poetics, and a
just completed work, The Golden Body: Perilous Journeys to the Essence of
Disability.  Jim has traveled, read, and published widely.  He is editor of
Napalm Health Spa, coordinator of the American Poet Greats lecture series,
and director of the online Museum of American Poetics.

Laura Feldman grew up in Merrick, NY. She received her BA in English
Literature from the University of Michigan and her MFA from the Naropa
Institute in Boulder, CO.  She has her MSW from Smith College and lives in
New York City.  Freezing Persons, her first novel, has recently been

UNESCO International Petition to Safeguard Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage

We, the undersigned, plead for an immediate end to the Taliban edict to
demolish Afghanistanâ€™s cultural heritage. We further urge the Taliban
spiritual leader Mullah Mohammed Omar to enter into dialogue with the
international community â€“including the Arab and Islamic governments that
overwhelmingly have condemned these actions â€“ in order to explore
proposals
to safeguard this irreplaceable cultural heritage from further, senseless
destruction.

The edict of the 26th of February 2001 to destroy pre-Islamic and Buddhist
objectsâ€”including the worldâ€™s largest standing Buddha statues at
Bamiyanâ€”runs counter to all the basic principles of respect, tolerance and
the wisdom upon which Islam is based, and is a breach of the Taliban pledge
made in 1999. We plead with Taliban authorities to stop this irreversible
assault on two millennia of Afghanistanâ€™s artistic and cultural
achievements, treasured not only as the spiritual birthright of Buddhists
everywhere but also as a universal cultural heritage for people of all
faiths and nationalities.

-Please sign and also forward this e-mail to friends, family, news groups,
mailing lists etc.

-To avoid adding ">>>" onto the chain, please preferably cut & paste the
entire petition and list of names into a new message prior to re-sending.

Palestinian uprising reverberates in song across Middle East
Jerusalem |Reuters | 10 November 2000


Arab singers are serenading the Palestinian Intifada uprising with songs of
heroism that are sweeping the Middle East. Their videos broadcast on Arab
satellite television channels depict the Palestinians battling heavily-armed
Israeli soldiers with stones and bullets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
heroes.

Many of the songs are about Mohammed Al Durra, a 12-year-old boy shot dead
in his father's arms early in the uprising as they tried to shelter from a
Gaza gun battle. Durra, whose death the Israeli army said it may have
caused, has become a symbol of the "Al Aqsa Intifada", or uprising, named
for the Jerusalem mosque. Many of the singers of the new songs are
Egyptians, although they hail also from Lebanon, Tunisia and the Gulf
states. Their songs play on car radios, at open markets and at shops and
cafes along the streets where the fighting takes place. Egypt's Hani Shaker,
one of the Arab world's most popular entertainers, dedicated his latest song
"At the Door of Jerusalem" to al-Durra:

It was the voice of right
Embodied in a child's cry
In the bosom of death.
A father's sigh in a last look
And a last sound.

The songs aim largely at a youthful audience. … In another song Lebanese pop
singer Walid Tawfiq urges Arab nations to win back Palestine, lauding
historical heroes like Saladin who ousted the Crusaders from the Holy Land
in the 12th century. "(Al-Durra's) blood flies in the air calling...Saladin.
/ Calling on Arabs to help Palestine. / They (Jews) killed us in Deir
Yassin...and Qana," Tawfiq's latest song goes, referring to Israeli
massacres of Arabs in Palestine and Lebanon in 1948 and 1996. Palestinian
poet Samih Al Qassim attributes the popularity of the songs in the Arab
world to a feeling of solidarity with Palestinians under occupation, and the
disappointment of the Arab masses in their own undemocratic regimes. "It is
an Arab national conscience explosion from the (Indian) Ocean to the Gulf
because of the accumulation of Israeli oppression and suppression on the
Arab nation since the beginnings of the 20th century," Qassim told Reuters.
The songs have become more widely popular than the nationalist melodies of
the first 1987-94 Intifada, thanks to an increasing number of Arab satellite
channels reporting round-the-clock news on the clashes.

A theme of many songs is a longing for Arab East Jerusalem, home to Al Aqsa
on the site Jews revere as the biblical Temple Mount. The Intifada erupted
after a visit to the site by leading Israeli hawk Ariel Sharon on September
28. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and
annexed it in a move not internationally recognised, but Palestinians want
East Jerusalem for the capital of a future state. "For the sake of God, life
is cheap. / Either Jerusalem is returned or we die," goes Shaker's song.


(As published on *Gulf News*, an English language newspaper published in the
United Arab Emirates. New music videos are still being produced and shown on
satelite television throughout the Middle East. Some are sung by child
singers. Most are highly produced with current Intifada footage woven
throughout. Some contain footage of the last two Arab-Israeli wars of Arab
soldiers in "heroic" charges. Some contain footage of dead Arab civilians in
village streets, I am assuming, from the 1948 war. One music video I saw
contained a dramatization of a sinister looking Israeli soldier aiming for a
child, shooting him, then thowing back his head in laughter.  -Nick)

Poets issue a call for peace
Muscat, Oman |By Arif Ali | 21 January 2001


Leading poets of India and Pakistan have called for peace between the two
neighbouring countries and underscored the importance of fighting the common
enemy of poverty and illiteracy. The call was made in the form of powerful
and sonorous Urdu verses recited by the poets at a well-attended 'mushaira'
held in honour of Jagannath Azad, the Indian octogenarian known for his
works on Allama Mohammad Iqbal, Pakistan's national poet.

The 'mushaira' could not have been timed better considering the conducive
political climate created of late by the two governments to resume a
dialogue and bury a bitter past in the larger interests of the peoples of
the two countries. The poets also highlighted the menace of corruption
afflicting the two nations. The presence of the ambassadors of both India
and Pakistan added to the importance of the event organised by Prof. Humayun
Zafar Zaidi and Mustajab Ahmed.

The first session of the mushaira was devoted to tributes paid to Azad, the
son of the Urdu poet, Tirlok Chand. Karam Elahi, Pakistan's ambassador, said
Urdu would be poorer without poets like Azad who has spent his life
projecting the immortal works of Iqbal. Similar sentiments were expressed by
Satnamjit Singh, India's ambassador.

The team of Pakistan poets was led by Ahmed Faraz, one of the best known
lyricists of his time. He was joined by Qasim Peerzada, Parto Rohilla and
Farrukh Zahra Geelani. The Indian team, led by Shahryar, included Saleem
Kausar, Manzar Bhopali, Rais Ansari, Agha Shorish and Saghar Khayyami.

_Tinfish, c'est moi!_, so please send journal correspondence to the new =

April, when I may well be on strike...).

_Tinfish_ 10 is now in and it's a beaut.  Please send your checks for =
$13 to my new address and you'll get one by return mail.  That will help =
mightily with journal expenses--if not moving ones.

THE ROADS AROUND JENKINS
by Theodore Enslin
(Dec. 2000)
Paper, 34 pp, $10
isbn 1-889960-04-7

"Theodore Enslin's 'Roads' are haunted by a memory decades old but still
transmitting messages into the present, received in musical pulsations. The
foretelling in Enslin's fine new poem is both balm & wound of an imminent
loss." - Peter O'Leary, LVNG Magazine
==================
STUDIES     [cuts   shots   takes]
by Kenneth Irby
(Mar. 2001)
Paper, 52 pp, $12
isbn 1-889960-05-5

Beginning at the center, Kenneth Irby digs into his Kansas heartland with
force of the perceptual imagination. His 'Studies' make images of life, and
bring delight through the affectionate wandering of his attention. Reading
topologies and what lies beneath them, Irby is a finder and weaver of the
real into the imagined. These 37 poems [from a notebook sequence written
between Aug. - Dec. 1999] run jazz-like word trails through an open field,
bopping in range of the real; at each turn something new, a surprise. The
mind and heart meet head-on.

If we compare the modes of existence of poetry, the listening
experience, the reading experience and the webbing experience, common
factors can be identified.

Firstly a commitment, prior to engagement with the text, to be
receptive to a collaborative experience with the poem in its mode of
existence.
Secondly the creation of a space for the poem to exist, a
reading-space, or listening-space, or cyber-space.
Thirdly the suspension of time as a duration, making available all
time ever experienced, a reading-time, listening-time and cyber-time.

But,the establishing of the preconditions for poetry by the end-user
does not always guarantee a text will be poetry.

Now let us consider the metaphorical spaces of the existence of
poetry and experience of it by the reader, listener and wwweber.
                All of these spaces are mnemonic spaces, involving
the memory in some way.

Initially there must be a subconscious memory of the look of words,
which makes reading possible, and the sound of words, which make
listening and identification possible, which is a part of a
Mnemonic-Processing space, recalling memory of previous experience to
process new stimuli, interpret language, to give meaning to what is
read or heard.
The Argument space, where the memory is progressively scanned for
comparison, refuting or supporting the arguments being made.
The Mnemonic-Imagining space where things are visualised; landscapes
and scenes rendered, characters enlivened, stories acted out and
senses heightened.
A               Mnemonic-Reflective space or that feeling of going
back in time to remember and relive a specific event in the past.
But language functions in this way too. So what distinguishes poetry
from language?

This brings us to consider the poetic moment.

A competent poet can facilitate the creation of the preconditions to
the poetic moment, through craft the mnemonic spaces can be conjured.
The poetic moment springs from the metaphorical spaces and is the
portal to the poem. The poetry enthusiast searches through words to
find that 'poetic moment' as Gaston Bauchelard talks about in the
Poetry of Space.
That is, the moment that the end-user become one with the poem, the
moment which preceeds thought, a reverberation of the soul/psyche,
like a door opening to let you in, the portal to
timelessness(suspension of realtime or time as duration) where all
time is contracted into the present moment.

Whether scanning words on pages in a book or scanning voices at a
sounding or navigating 3d spaces on a computer, the end-user is
looking for that poetic moment. Like drugs and sex, words can suspend
time and create a space for poetry.

i am not a programmer of computer languages, but acknowledge that
there is poetry in code and  i can understand the arguments for
internet poetry being a poetry of code put forward by poets like
cramer.
but cyberspace is large, infinite, there is room for non-programmers
and programmers alike, high-enders and low-enders.
i am a drag and drop poet, and i figure that software gives me the
power to create in this medium and still make a uniquely
computer-dependent poetry, even if it is not always internet
dependent.

the earliest experiments were cliche representations of single words,
verbs, in 3d, words did what they said they were going to do.

i then began to incorporate verbs into nouns, by animating nouns,
making them act out motions, incorporating the verb in the noun.
i was making a poetry of nouns only, textscapes; scenes, using only nouns.

adjectives were not needed either. colour, shape, thickness, font
face, speed of motion, depth of field, could all be carried by nouns.

but was i exlporing new literary devices in this new medium?

or was it merely that i was creating a poetry without grammatical structure?

the nouns in 3d space were doing the work of phrases or sentences,
they make statements.
in poetry on the page and in performance, whilst the definite and
indefinite article, conjunctions, prepositions, other joining words,
and parts of written language can be dispensed with, and have been
dispensed with over the last 30 years, a poetry of nouns alone is
difficult outside of cyberspace.

the scripting of poems containing words that are not usually
thematically linked created a parataxis of words.
the paratactic device of placing separate stand alone phrases in one
poetry line, can be found in many poetries.
the paratactic device is best exemplified in l=a=n=g=u=a=g=e poetry
of the eighties and nineties, and fore-shadowed in surreal poetry
early last century, and evident in medieval english poetry, and
present in much contemporary printed and performance poetry that
today would be considered main stream.
since words are doing the work of phrases or groupings of verbs,
adjectives and nouns, then in placing words in paratactic opposition
in 3d, it makes sense that it is possible to create poetry in 3d
space which allows interpretation in the association of seemingly
unrelated statements.


also the morphing capabilities of 3d software allowed me to change
letters of words over time, the visual word with its associations to
another word paratactically opposed to it.
words are made up of composite parts, syllables, and letters of the alphabet.
in my experimentation these composite parts wanted to be statements
of their own.
in the poem marriage the i begins to shrink within the other letters
even though the word  is dominant as a whole, the i begins to wriggle
uncomfortably within the marriage, it separates from the word
marriage even before it has broken away from it. new words form from
syllables of the old; mirage; rage; age; and new paratactic
confrontations not present in the original word. in the second half
of the poem words are split up as in marriage separation.
here is a new sort of syllable and letter parataxis made possible in
this medium.
if you are familiar with the work of mez net_wurker or mary ann
breeze, then you will be able to see another kind of syllable and
letter parataxis.


so i believe i am making a new kind of poetry.

mez's parenthetic(is this a word?) splitting of words, changes the
way you first read the word when you rescan it and make a new
combination of syllables within the one word.

it's a parataxis of letters and syllables.

"If something is boring after two minutes, try it for four. If still boring,
then eight. Then sixteen. Then thirty-two. Eventually one discovers that it
is not boring at all."
-- John Cage

housepress is pleased to announce the release of
DAY by Kenneth Goldsmith.

DAY questions the mundane, "nutritionless writing" and found text.

"Innovative poetry seems to be a perfect place to place a valueless
practice; as a gift economy, it is one of the last places in late
hyper-capitalism that allows non-function as an attribute. Both
theoretically and politically, the field remains wide open."
 --  Kenneth Goldsmith

    published in a numbered edition of 50 numbered copies, DAY  is printed
on  southworth 25% white cotton bond folded & handbound in a modified
japanese style. every copy of DAY, has a copy of CIGNA tipped in, a further
exploration of found and appropriated text, also by Kenneth Goldsmith.

http://www.chbooks.com/online/fidget/index.html) and _No.111
2.7.93-10.20.96_ (figures, 1997, online at:
http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/goldsmith/111/ ). his work can be found

Florida Postcard

A strip of marsh,
A few bare trees,
And white flames dancing,
on Spanish roofs.

"But what's in it for me," yawned Mr. Chang, langloriciously.

Merengue bands or solitude;
Pretty brunettes, whom I suspect, shower nude;
Shall I scrape a poem from the sidewalk for you, Mr. Chang?

"No. Not unless it's Po Chu-i.
And he resides in clouds, not poetry."

But tonight, I have only Wallace Stevens,
And white Flamenco flames, dancing
On Spanish roofs;

NEW YORK POSTCARD #1

NEW YORK POSTCARD #1

"And death shall have no dominion...",

Still, it took him by surprise;
A charcoal hanging at the White Horse Tavern,
Froze the look, in his startled, harrowing eyes;
Even Dylan Thomas was taken by surprise;

Poet, write of love and life,
Give us sunsets and cats' tails,
And ignore the Reaper while you can,
At least, that's my opinion;

For his best poet was born in Wales,
And now death shall be his dominion.

There's a puddle, take care!
It's filled with desire.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

i've always considered the canadian vehemence
against being considered or compared to americans
just a touch too hysterical to be mere patriotism
- perhaps it is an "anxiety of influence" that we
so desperately define ourselves as "not american"
- as tho watching american television, wearing
american clothing, reading american books,
listening to american music and largely living
(with slightly more left-wing leanings tho that
too is changing) the american dream - while
dinner table conversations revolve around largely
american topics - does not make us - not
americans - but honourary americans

given the high amount of illegal immigration,
voter apathy and corporate "outsourcing" to 3rd
World nations - i'd also say a large number of
americans are "honourary americans" as well - in
the political/economical sense - perhaps they are
the truest americans - not that one would know
this watching television, movies or reading the
paper

i am always amazed that a Canadian will never
tell a travel story about going to Europe w/o
mentioning how they will usually display their
canadian flags - mentioning how foreigners always
respect Canadians more than "rude" Americans -
it's almost a projection of anti-Americanism
placed on the Europeans - its easier to say
"Europeans don't like americans" than "I don't
like americans" or "(Nice) Canadians don't like
americans"

perhaps its being such a young nation - or
Trudeau's "mouse and elephant" analogy - that we
haven't fully developed our own sense of
self-hood utterly separate from american -
whether reacting to or against - i think this is
a project that will take generations - probably
hundreds of years - before it sees fruition

i for one am not uncomfortable with being so
culturally influenced by america - given its many
achievements - my poetic "influences" - perhaps
affinities is a better word - are in the main -
american - i have yet to see a Canadian Whitman,
or Dickinson - perhaps such a thing is impossible
in a country so young - but i do dream of such a
thing - which is not to say we have not had our
luminaries - Atwood, Purdy, Dewdney, perhaps even
Leonard Cohen

i've no desire to live in america - why should i?
but to deny to overwhelming influence that
america has had on the entire world is foolish -
when most countries in the world *seem* to be
working towards an american model

we can quibble over the differences of course -
we are "multicultural" not "a melting pot" - we
have "peace-keepers" not "soldiers" - a
"parliament" not a "congress"- we have "beer" not
"watered down monkey urine" - but i suspect the
differences are more skin deep than most
canadians care to admit

that's the working notion anyway

Kominos. This is interesting. You may well be making a new kind of poetry.
I'd have to see some of it on whatever site or sites but yet (and/or until
then) I'm not convinced that this cant be also done with a pencil and pieces
of paper.
 My feeling is that changes due to technology do occur. It would be easy to
find thousands of examples and much of the innovation that has taken place
in the last two centuries is either partly caused by or utilises and is
influenced by technological advances (or the negative effects of certain
technical novelties and developments).  But I think the effects of
technology and what technology is have to be considered. Remember that even
Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman were using new technology. In fact Emily
Dickinson used (quite logically) an innovation (that had been made probably
some hundreds of years previous to her own birth: the ink, the pen, paper).
All of them were technological advances. In fact she was one of the greatest
innovators but eschewed the use of the typwritter to "pen" her very strange
and sometimes shockingly obscure or beautiful poems.I dont know if Mallarme
or Whitman used the typewriter... I'm not being facetious: I think that in
some way Dickinson (probably in many ways), was aware of scientific and
technical advances...although it may not have figured as large as it may
have to someone who was less reclusive. Who knows.
  I think the internet and poetry on sites etc is fantastic: the old cliche
about the "global vilage" is coming true...somewhat.  I have only quite
recently aquired a PC and the newness of "cyberspace" is great, and the
opportunities it generates for communication etc  But as Patrick is hinting,
or as I read him so far, it still bypasses the "essentials". Or it can.
Visual art and poetry become conflated: so that  indeed the process becomes
more obvious: there's another lunge or leap toward (hopefully) more
"reality" paradoxically through the constant real-time transformation and
re-conformation of words...as long as the content is there: the deep thing
still there. No reason why they shouldnt...any more than the typewriter
destroyed "the soul" of poetry nor can the computer. It can and will
enhance...but dont get too fixated on cyber, at least I feel...and what can
an ingenious individual do with an ingenious pen?
  Apart from that direction, I think that the positive things about the
cyberworld etc is the communication offered world wide. Thus the sharing of
info. Thus one doesnt go off erroneously thinking one has invented something
(which has already been postulated so you can forget that). NB its also
exclusive somewhat (if I was a good "budgeter" I would sell my computer and
forgo paying Xtra (my Int. Provider )etc but "(humans) doesnt (dont) live by
bread alone"). But I think as costs come down on the net and techno etc then
more people throughout the world will gain acess to knowledge they'd never
want to know about otherwise. So its clearly very meaningful to a lot of
people throughout the world (potentially)that people such as yourself
experiment and provide interesting, challenging, and hopefully humanly
beneficial culture, poetry, art and so on. Also that they can contribute,
regardless of their "status" or ethnicity or age or sex or state of health
or (hoefully) the political climate (even if its a very negative situation
they are in). Doesnt obviate the pen and paper though. And we are always
left with challenging questions. Lets use this technology with some humility
("that's ripe coming from him!"!) and hopefully wisely. Regards, Richard
Taylor. PS I feel all gooey and righteous now!

Franklin.  I've done Maths up to say ...well problems in calculus analysing
wave forms and also some stats etc for telecommunications purposes but I got
absolutely lost on a paper called "Linear Algebra" which completely baffled
me, but I passed the exam (just), then I hurriedly abandoned any attempt to
understand mathematics (or "pure mathematics"). But yes, that was a little
"witticism" of mine. I was debating with a friend as to the value of science
and he's read the book in which a bogus philosophic "postmodernist" paper
was presented and he's read all about that and hence he feels that Science
is all and so on and I value science (properly used and in the right hands
etc) but I was a bit "paranoid" when someone queried my email to (the Rev
Dent was it?). I thought they were mathematicians (turns out at least one
was a poet in Ireland!) thinking that I was a Derridean or whatever so I
reacted rather excesively...my negative example for preciseness (or
ambiguity)etc in language being a bit unfortunate. I presume that you ARE a
mathematician (or thus trained)and I'll take your word for it re
polynomials. Some fascinating language resonances can be stolen by poets
from scientific and technical fields. Do Scientists poeticise their
wonderfully Gradgrindean world groaning with endless facts and trivia such
as Fermat's last thoerem.? Mind you, I "waste" a lot of time playing over
grandmaster chess games or playing on ICC. My brother was always good at
solving mathematical puzzles and it used to infuriate me how quickly he
picked up card games etc (and this may have contributed to the "nuerosis" I
have in that respect if I have one), but, despite his BSc he's now a
relatively happy person whose main hobby is tramping etc.
  But I thought that my question was rather clever: but then I'm no great
logician.
Interesting how two (unrelated?) fields can intersect a bit. Maybe Lewis
Carol would have found it all very amusing? Maybe not...oh well....Regards,
Richard. PS. Could it not be allowed me that I could postulate a variable
variable?

Listees,

are any of you planning to demonstrate at the trade meetings being held
april 20-21 in quebec city? I know that some US activists have been turned
away at the border already but as the public learns more about how these
secret talks affect their lives, the turning of Canada into a police state
will not be tolerated.

It didn't start in Seattle and it won't end in Quebec City.

for more info please contact me.

thanks,

NAFTA + WTO =3D FTAA - What is the "FTAA"?=20
from http://www.tradewatch.org=20

The Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) is the formal name given to an e=
xpansion of NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) that would incl=
ude nearly all of the countries in the western hemisphere. This massive NAF=
TA expansion is currently being negotiated in secret by trade ministers fro=
m a total of 34 nations in North, Central and South America and the Caribbe=
an. The goal of the FTAA is to impose the failed NAFTA model of increased p=
rivatization and deregulation hemisphere-wide. Imposition of these rules wo=
uld empower corporations to constrain governments from setting standards fo=
r public health and safety, to safeguard their workers, and to ensure corpo=
rations do not pollute the communities in which they operate. Effectively, =
these rules would handcuff governments=82 public interest policymaking and =
enhance corporate control at the expense of citizens throughout the America=
s. FTAA would deepen the negative effects of NAFTA we've seen in Canada, Me=
xico and the U.S. !
over the past seven years and expand NAFTA's damage to the other 31 countri=
es involved. The FTAA would intensify NAFTA's "race to the bottom": under F=
TAA, exploited workers in Mexico could be leveraged against even more despe=
rate workers in Haiti, Guatemala or Brazil by companies seeking tariff-free=
 access back into U.S. markets. A quick look at NAFTA's legacy reveals disa=
strous consequences: An estimated 395,000 U.S. jobs have been lost since NA=
FTA as companies relocated to Mexico to take advantage of the weaker labor =
standards. These workers usually find jobs with less security and wages tha=
t are about 77% of what they originally had.

The U.S. trade surplus with Mexico has become a deficit for the first time.=
 Despite promises of increased economic development throughout Mexico, only=
 the border region has seen intensified industrial activity. Yet even this =
small "gain" has not brought prosperity. Over one million more Mexicans wor=
k for less than the minimum wage of $3.40 per day today than before NAFTA, =
and during the NAFTA period, eight million Mexicans have fallen from the mi=
ddle class into poverty.=20

In addition, the increase of border industry has created worsening environm=
ental and public health threats in the area. Every day, 44 tons of hazardou=
s waste are disposed of improperly. In this time, birth defects have increa=
sed dramatically. In the first year of NAFTA in one Texas border county, 15=
 babies were born without brains -- an unprecedented 36% increase from the =
year before! Along the border, the occurrence of some diseases, including h=
epatitis, is two or three times the national average, due to lack of sewage=
 treatment and safe drinking water. Although it=82s hard to imagine that an=
yone would push for more of a failed model like this, what little we do kno=
w about FTAA is that is likely to look quite a bit like NAFTA. In fact, som=
e FTAA texts are reported to be literally based on NAFTA, with additional c=
ountries added in. We know what results to expect!=20

Who is involved in the FTAA negotiations, and how did it get started?=20

High on their NAFTA victory, U.S. officials organized a Summit of the Ameri=
cas in Miami in December 1994. Trade ministers from every country in the we=
stern hemisphere (except for Cuba) agreed to launch negotiations to establi=
sh a hemispheric free trade deal. After the "Miami Summit," however, little=
 more was done on FTAA until the "Santiago Summit" in Chile in April 1998. =
However, at this second summit the 34 nations set up a Trade Negotiations C=
ommittee (TNC), consisting of vice ministers of trade from every country an=
d headed by Dr. Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini of Argentina. Negotiators als=
o agreed on a structure of nine working groups to deal with the major areas=
 they agreed to cover under FTAA: agriculture, services, investment, disput=
e settlement, intellectual property rights, subsidies and anti-dumping, com=
petition policy, government procurement and market access. You would never =
know it from news reports, but since late 1999, the working groups have bee=
n meeting every !
few months to lay out their countries=82 positions on these issues and try =
to develop treaty language.=20

As with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI), many Members of Con=
gress have no idea this is even going on. Congress has set no goals for the=
 U.S.=82s participation in these talks and has not delegated to the Executi=
ve branch its Constitutional role of setting the terms of international com=
merce. However, a variety of corporate committees do advise the U.S. negoti=
ators; under the trade advisory committee system, over 500 corporate repres=
entatives have security clearance and access to FTAA NAFTA expansion docume=
nts. Organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS), Inter=
-American Development Bank (IDB), and the UN Economic Commission for Latin =
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), collectively known as the "Tripartite Co=
mmittee," also provide direction. Early on, non-governmental civil society =
organizations (NGOs) demanded working groups on democratic governance, labo=
r and human rights, consumer safety and the environment. These were rejecte=
d, and instead a C!
ommittee of Government Representatives on Civil Society was established to =
represent the views of civil society to the TNC. Yet this committee is litt=
le more than a mail in-box. It has no mechanism to incorporate civil societ=
y concerns and suggestions into the actual negotiations, so these are mainl=
y ignored.=20

The U.S. is represented by the U.S. Trade Representative=82s office (USTR),=
 headed by Charlene Barshefsky as of November 2000. The lead USTR negotiato=
r on FTAA is Peter Allgeier.=20

What will FTAA's practical effects be?=20

Because negotiations are occurring in secret and no texts have been made pu=
blicly available, we cannot know the details of the draft text. However, ou=
r conversations with the USTR have given us some clues about what to expect=
 once a final agreement is unveiled -- in other words, once it's too late t=
o change it!=20

Essential Social Services Endangered

The FTAA will contain a series of commitments to "liberalize" services, whi=
ch is much like the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) within th=
e WTO. "Services" is a broad category that includes education, health care,=
 environmental services (which can include access to water!), energy, posta=
l services and anything else we pay for that isn=82t a physical object. Pos=
sible effects of the FTAA services agreement include:=20

Removal of national licensing standards for medical, legal and other key pr=
ofessionals, allowing doctors licensed in one country to practice in any co=
untry, even if their level of training or technological sophistication is d=
ifferent;

privatization of public schools and prisons in the U.S., opening the door t=
o greater corporate control, corruption and the temptation to cut critical =
corners (such as medical care for inmates or upkeep of safe school faciliti=
es) in the interests of improving profit margins;=20

and privatization of postal services transferring U.S. Postal Service funct=
ions to a few delivery companies like FedEx, which could then send postal r=
ates through the roof.=20

Investment and a Backdoor MAI

FTAA NAFTA expansion provides a potential "back door" for the Multilateral =
Agreement on Investment (MAI), through negotiations focused on investments =
and in the financial services sector. We didn't call the MAI "NAFTA on ster=
oids" for nothing! The MAI is based on NAFTA and direct NAFTA expansion is =
just another way to impose these rules. Like in NAFTA's Chapter 11, the UST=
R says that FTAA will include "investor-to-state" suits. These allow corpor=
ations to sue governments directly for the removal of standards or laws des=
igned to protect public health and safety, which may cost the corporations =
a little more in operating costs. In other words, the FTAA would provide a =
hemispheric "regulatory takings" clause that explicitly values corporate pr=
ofits over human costs. NAFTA cases that set a likely precedent for FTAA ac=
tions under this provision include:=20

The Canadian funeral home chain Loewen Group used NAFTA investor protection=
s to sue the U.S. government for $750 million in cash damages after a Missi=
ssippi court found Loewen guilty of malicious and fraudulent practices that=
 unfairly targeted a local small business. (NAFTA permits companies to sue =
governments over rulings or regulations that may potentially limit their pr=
ofits.) Loewen argues that the very existence of the state court system vio=
lates its NAFTA rights.=20

The U.S.-based Ethyl Corporation forced Canada to pay $13 million in damage=
s and drop its ban on the dangerous gasoline additive MMT, a known toxin th=
at attacks the human nervous system. Other regulations protecting public he=
alth and the environment remain open for attack under NAFTA and FTAA. In a =
similar case, U.S.-based Metalclad Corp. sued a Mexican state to allow a to=
xic waste disposal site, claiming that the environmental zoning law forbidd=
ing the dump constituted an effective seizure of the company=82s property -=
 a seizure that, under the property rights extended by NAFTA (and to be per=
petuated in FTAA), requires that the offending government compensate the co=
mpany.=20

Food, Agriculture & GMOs

The U.S. is trying to force all countries to accept biotechnology and genet=
ically modified (GM) foods in which unregulated U.S.-based corporations hav=
e taken a lead. Yet food security organizations all over the world agree th=
at these technologies will increase hunger in poor nations. Being forced to=
 buy expensive patented seeds every season, rather than saving and planting=
 their own, will force traditional subsistence farmers in the developing wo=
rld into dependency on transnational corporations and closer to the brink o=
f starvation. If the U.S. position wins out, FTAA will promote the interest=
s of biotech and agribusiness giants like Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Car=
gill and Monsanto over the interests of hungry people in developing nations=
=2E=20

Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)

The U.S. is trying to expand NAFTA's corporate protectionism rules on paten=
ts to the whole hemisphere. These rules give a company with a patent in one=
 country the monopoly marketing rights to the item throughout the region. T=
hese rules are enforced with cash fines and criminal penalties, making thes=
e rules even harsher than the WTO IPR rules. These rules have been used as =
justification for pharmaceutical companies to quash compulsory licensing me=
chanisms to allow competitor companies to manufacture a drug in exchange fo=
r a fee for "renting" the patent.

This monopoly control allows pharmaceutical corporations to keep drug price=
s high and block production of generic versions of life-saving drugs, which=
 spells disaster for the ill and impoverished, especially in developing nat=
ions. These rules also allow companies to "bioprospect" and lock down paten=
ts for traditional medicines that are considered "traditional knowledge," e=
ffectively robbing indigenous people of their cultural heritage to fatten c=
orporate wallets.=20

What is the current status of the FTAA negotiations?=20

All the negotiating groups have held meetings at two to three month interva=
ls throughout 2000. Negotiators have laid out the positions of their govern=
ments on the nine core issues. As of fall 2000, they are in the process of =
consolidating proposed text to find points of agreement among the governmen=
ts. A complete "bracketed" (draft) text will be ready in December 2000. Vic=
e ministerial level meetings on FTAA NAFTA expansion will begin in early 20=
01. The next ministerial-level Summit of the Americas is planned for Quebec=
 City, Canada on April 18-22, 2001, at which negotiators will start buildin=
g a whole text. The agreement is to be complete and implemented in 2005.=20

'oh yes to write so childlike,' said jennifer


oh yes to write so childlike, said jennifer, it is to do something with
sound and language, is it not. oh yes it is. it is to make simple what
would be abstract, to make material what would be sound, to make sound
what would be talking of talking of unknown things. all to have one word
like a language point or protolanguage, one thing shuffled against one
thing, sound like golden voice. how to make skin show through very thin
cloth and how to make sun double and there are ten suns. how to make ten
lights. how to make ten sounds and there are ten sounds. how to make pipes
of proper length and pitch of pipe. how to make scent. how to make touch
and odor. how to make smell. how to make heat and how to call heat away
from thin cloth and skin. how to know the metals. how to know wood. how to
know boys and girls and how to look at all men and women. i do love to
write like this so. it is a way and a means. it is a process and it is
never a goal. it is never a present and it is never a thing. it is never a
constitution. it is never an apparatus or an institution. it is never a
style. it is so just like this, word follows word, space just like i would
leave, said jennifer, between this telling and another. i will write this,
said jennifer, and i will write another.

it is so very important, said lovely jennifer, that you do understand this
like a dream when you are thinking so very much about important things for
you, and you are making these important things. that you see soft slippers
of shadows everywhere from ten suns.

we are not a child, we are jennifer and nikuko, we are nikuko and alan, we
are very careful with our child ways and lovely talking.

we talk about the most important things, said jennifer.

we are students in lovely school, she said.

I thought what I said was pretty clear, not to mention obvious.
You said that most of those currently supporting racist policies were
"losers" - not a term I'm comfortable with but, taking the meaning if not
the slur, this is a fairly accurate generalisation. The leap you made was to
claim that the responsibility for loss (of employment, services etc) lay
with these so-called losers. And that's what I objected to. You came across
like those people who speak dismissively of "dole bludgers", the implication
being that anyone who is unemployed is so by choice. I'd like to see the
evidence.

I don't know how you got this out of my post - I can't even begin to engage
with it. At no point did I even hint at such an analysis which is plainly
absurd, although this doesn't prevent an over-hyped section of the
Australian population from believing that slamming Asians and Aborigines is
the way to go. An emotional response rather than a coherent critique.

Richard Tyler also said -
Australia seems to be in pretty good shape to me.  Of course the working

Australia is on the verge of a recession and I doubt that all the working
class think like your friend Ant.

A Note on This List

This is an announcement list for events and phenomena related to Fence, a
literary journal published in New York and distributed nationally. If
you're not familiar with Fence, please visit our website at
http://www.fencemag.com. This list is used about 8 times a year to announce
our new issues (April and November) and various readings and benefits held
mostly but not exclusively in New York. In fall of 2001 Fence will be
making its way out to the west coast for a brief reading tour to celebrate
its fall issue and the publication of Zirconia, by Chelsey Minnis.

If you'd like to be removed from this list, please reply with "remove" in
the subject heading. If you are receiving multiples of this message but
would like to stay on, please reply with "multiple" in the subject heading
and I'll do my best to whittle it down to one. This list has been culled
over several years from many sources, including other lists forwarded to me
by other literary people/institutions. The list has recently been updated,
and so if you find yourself on it again after previously having been taken
off, I am doubly or triply apologetic.

Ah, but it's worse than that.  Godel proved in 1931 that in any
system which resembles the way we do mathematics enough to have
recognizable (to us) proofs and basic arithmetic necessarily has
statements which can neither be proven no disproven.  Such statements
are called undecidable.  Of course what is undecidable in one system
is a theorem in another --- take the statement as an axiom, e.g.

I've been gone and maybe someone's already said this, but in case
they haven't...

(P.S.  Nearly all my mathematical work is connected in some way to
undecidability.  Most mathematicians, on the other hand, have no
truck with it, avoid it whenever posible.)

I just voted for a bunch of poets (Loy, Ceravolo, Kaufman, Stein,
etc.), and was gratified (not to mention surprised) to see that the
vote I cast for Ted Berrigan pushed him into the Top Ten category,
just easing past Blake. Whoa. That is so Instant Gratification I just
can't stand it!

I also cast a vote for O'Hara, hoping to help him leap over William
Carlos Williams (O'Hara I think is like two or three behind the Dr.).
I have nothing against WCW. I just like the horse race aspect of this.
(Like seeing Ad Reinhardt's comics in action & applied to poets.)

I'm the only vote so far for Lew Welch. Ron?

The Poetry Center & American Poetry Archives
presents

An afternoon reading with
BENJAMIN FRIEDLANDER & HORACE COLEMAN

Thursday afternoon March 15
4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

BENJAMIN FRIEDLANDER's new book of poetry, A Knot Is Not A Tangle
(Krupskaya Books, 2000), presents "all the great heresies. . . : poignant
rhymes, literate feints and graceless parries, the bogus and the beautiful,
elliptical, epochal, and incidental" (Brian Kim Stefans).  Over the course
of numerous brief books and the co-editing of several magazines over the
past two decades, Mr. Friedlander has developed a restless,
ultra-skeptical, and incessantly trying poesis--up against the ends of "the
poem" per se and "a sordid world / of fallen nets / and hammered / cask
replies."  His scholarly work resulted recently in the beautifully edited
Collected Prose of Charles Olson (U California), with Donald Allen.  Along
with Steve Evans, he co-edits the journal Sagetrieb.  A collection of
essays is currently in preparation, as well as a study of Emily Dickinson
and the Civil War.  Ben Friedlander lives in Old Town, Maine, and teaches
at the University of Maine, Orono.  This is his first local reading since
leaving the Bay Area in 1992.

HORACE COLEMAN's In The Grass (Viet Nam Generation/Burning Cities Press,
1995) is one of the great candid works of imaginative response to the state
of affairs in post-Vietnam War USA.  The late Gwendolyn Brooks once wrote
of his poetry that it is "sharp and uncompromising--but invincibly warm."
(Mr. Coleman's eulogy for Ms. Brooks appeared recently in the online
magazine The Black World Today, www.tbwt.com).  His poetry composes a new
Songs of Experience for a mostly unspoken-for generation.  In addition to
being a former university professor, Horace Coleman has been a writer in
the schools and a technical writer.  His poetry is included in numerous
anthologies focused on the Vietnam War and aftermath.  Originally from
Ohio, he lives in southern California and is a Viet Nam veteran, "class of
'67."

I believe that in the world out there Anne Carson is considered
somewhat daring and avant-garde.

However you choose to categorize her or define the notion of
avant-garde, she's far from the usual dreck, a remarkable and very
personal kind of intelligence, sharply focused.  I recall her being
discussed with some admiration on this list a few years ago.

And her scholarly work really is extraordinary, brilliant and always
a bit (sometimes much more than a bit) slanted from the norm.  Some
of her "translations" from ancient Greek are very strange and
wonderful.

There are lots of ways to write well.  It isn't her fault that she
wins prizes (she got a Lannan a couple or three years ago, maybe
there's more).

i find the notion of "escaping" the US a little
odd - do they shoot people at the borders there?
to leave i mean - not to enter?

an interesting pic crossed my way in my email
awhile back - it showed George Dubyah and a man
standing beside him - the caption beneath listed
him as "unidentified" - after listing the names
of several world leaders

it was (of course) our Right Honourable Prime
Minister Jean Cretien

perhaps we are less "honorary" than "forgotten"?
-i like John Ralston Saul's metaphor of "siamese
twins" - it's perhaps even more accurate

and - for the record - i have no intentions of
now or ever becoming an American - i have to
admit - the notion scares me a little

Dear list,

In response to Michael's nuanced letter regarding Canadian-ness (or
un-American-ness), I submit my URL, which contains several essays on
Canadian music (not poetry, but poetics in a certain sense), mostly
dealing with composers born after 1950 (with a few exceptions). I hope
this can provide further food-for-thought while I hatch out a more
detailed response to some of Michael's points :

http://pages.infinit.net/kore/couroux.html

under "writings"

sone in French, some in English, many still to be posted

also, more to the poetics list point, there is a short story called
"hothouse" in PDF format, which I am currently making a radio-play out
of. comments always appreciated.

Best to all,

Marc Couroux

I gather FOREWORD has such a bizarre list because they request
(electronic?) galleys be sent three months prior to publication?  If this
is the case, I would 1) urge all those publishing to send FOREWORD
electronic galleys, since obviously only Story Line is doing so, 2) rather
than proceeding by nomination alone for our list prize, perhaps it would be
more fair to automatically nominate all full-length books published in 2000
which have been promo-ed here, and then allow nominations to widen the
pool.

It's _The Making of a Poem : a Norton Anthology of Poetic Forms_  edited by
Mark Strand and Eavan Boland. Came out last year. It's actually not too
bad. Though not much of a Strand fan, I found myself enjoying his
introduction more than I'd expected to.

Hi everyone, just an addendum regarding the Lambda literary awards,
about which Ron Silliman posted here last month, citing them as an
example of how "short lists look like when people care enough to do
them right."

I was very happy when the organizers called and asked me to be a
judge for the novel category (novels written by men), because so many
wonderful novels happened to have been issued in 2000, and then they
told me the finalists had already been chosen, and surprise!  None of
the books I had in mind appeared on the list!  Indeed the five
nominees are all to one degree or another exercises in the same
tedious realism that have dominated this award from the beginning!
Apparently a team of 'experts' goes in and weeds out all the
experimental and otherwise interesting work from the list before the
judges get to vote.  I would happily have given the prize to either
Stephen Beachy ("Distortion"), Dennis Cooper ("Period"), or Lawrence
Braithwaite ("Ratz are Nice")--I CAN'T REMEMBER IF I CAN USE THE WORD
"EITHER" WHEN TALKING ABOUT THREE THINGS!!!  Anyway all 3 books are
ENDURING MASTERPIECES compared to the books that were actually
nominated!!!  and then there was a whole bunch of novels on a
slightly lower tier of accomplishment (than my big 3, including very
fine books by Brad Gooch, Brian Pera, C. Bard Cole, Brian Bouldrey
etc etc.  But instead I'm stuck with some REAL SNORERS.  Funny though
that the corresponding women's category is largely or entirely of
experimental work, though here again they left out the novel of the
year (Eileen Myles' "Cool for You.")  Why is this?  --

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994.
A `round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery by Brad
Brace. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
stellar, trajective alignment past the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative
metaphors for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of events...

A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual
impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless
present of the Net.

An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and
re-sequenced over time... ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The
12hr dialtone...

                  [ see  ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous,
reckless... >> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous,
provocative, poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic,
pathological... >> Evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
entertaining, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring...

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest
on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs  has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years`
worth of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the
ongoing publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each
12-hour posting is like the turning of a page; providing ample time
for reflection, interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other
transcultural projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established at

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some
opportunities still exist for financially assisting the publication of
editions of large (36x48") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet
quadtones bound as an oversize book. Other supporters receive rare
copies of the first three web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

Judy Roitman reminds us that "Men in the Off Hours," by Anne
Carson (Alfred A. Knopf) . . .  is considered somewhat daring and
avant-garde (by those out there). And perhaps lumping her in with the
"same ol' same ol'" is some the list being somewhat unduly fickle.

Point taken. But I think what the "same ol' same ol'" tag really was
meant for was the "authority" represented by the publishers, not just
for the work itself. I saw Carson read a year or so ago and I thought she
was quite wonderful.

The mainstream verse culture has always taken one or two interesting
writers into the fold. They even give some of them the pulitzer. After
certain publishing houses validate them.

I'm sure none of this is true, of course. If Knopf called me this
afternoon and said please give us some poems, I can't say as I'd refuse.
Damn phone keeps not ringing though.

PS. I hope she wins.

And so say I. Anne Carson's "Eros the Bittersweet" (Princeton) is one of my
favorite essays.

Also, as I understand Godel (mostly via Hofstadter), you can create a
meta-system to decide the undecidable statements, but then you have a new
system subject to Godel's theorem in which all systems have undecidable
statements. And then there are meta-meta-systems which...

Judy, do I have this right?

Michael,

There are a couple of particularly fine, haunting pantoums by Armand
Schwerner in his collection Sounds of the River Naranjana (published by
Station Hill Press). I can't lay my hands on my copy at the moment to
give you the titles, but they shouldn't be difficult to find among the
shorter poems in that volume. (I suspect they're also in the recently
published Selected Shorter Poems that Armand assembled before he died,
thought I haven't seen it--perhaps someone else on the list can say. But
you can be fairly certain that they're not in Strand's anthology!)

66 East 4th Street, New York (near 2nd and 3rd Avenue)

March 24th (Saturday) - 8:00 - Admission $7 / $5 members.
Information - 212-673-0090



A series of video tapes concerned with ballet and sexuality; with the
Parables of Nikuko and dance; with frenzy and stasis. The work was
uniquely created for projection and cdrom. We explore the imaginary
through the procuring and erasure of sign systems. We will show tapes,
and present a dance/performance event: BAAL.

The tapes include Seals (body demarcation); Baal (sexuality and ballet);
Nn (the distance of the body); Car (running against the machine); Bal
(movement fury); Ennui (clash); and other pieces including the Parables.

Foofwa d'Imobilite is a New York-based multi-media dancer/choreographer;
Azure Carter does performance and soundwork; Alan Sondheim is known for
his multi-media work online and off. All three have an interest in taking
language and genre to the limit.


(Inexpensive cdroms will be available at the screening.)

the point that this analysis misses is that
governments have never been anything more than the
general councils of the ruling class. they exist as a
means for the ruling class to impliment its desires,
and judge the mood of its waged and unwaged slaves
(i.e. the working class).

"democracy" is the illusion of mediation between the
classes which tricks us into participating in our own
enslavement.

this notion that governments exist to somehow protect
us is naive at best.

the globalization we are now experiencing in general,
and the ftaa specifically, is just the realization of
the internationalization of the ruling class and thier
markets forms and the end of imperialism (which
effectively ended with the bretton woods accords and
the onset of the cold war, and completely ended with
the end of the cold war). they have to open up trade
barriers (i.e. those "reforms" they have given us over
the years to keep us from overthrowing them). they
have to create global standards. etc.

we are not going to stop globalization by regressing
to nationalism (in a right-wing or left-wing version),
since this is merely an attempt to go backwards in
time, which even if possible, would just eventually
take us back to where we are now; nor can we reform it
away. i don't doubt that before too long they will
capitulate to the least radical demands in an attempt
to take the wind out of the anti-globalization
movement, and then continue with their plans when no
one's looking (as they have always done... i mean:
ever wonder why the "punishments" given by governments
to corporations are negligible?)... but this will take
place within the context of globalization. there will
still be an enslaved working class, sections of which
will still be starving and homeless. the planet will
continue to be destroyed. because this is what
capitalism is. the only option is to destroy it, "root
and branch".

Subject:      Gallery Report:  Will Alexander at Beyond Baroque
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Last night Will Alexander opened his first show, in the tiny upstairs
gallery at Beyond Baroque where he occasionally teaches his free
vertiginous collaborative ars poetica, which is unsurprisingly currently
based on readings in the letters of surrealist painters Miro, de
Chirico, et.al.  The pictures are a "tip of the iceberg" selection of 15
years' work.  Alexander currently works mostly in dry media since he has
no studio space.

If you are familiar with the physical objects of his books STRATOSPHERIC
CANTICLES, ABOVE THE HUMAN NERVE DOMAIN, and TOWARDS THE PRIMEVAL
LIGHTNING FIELD, you have seen "Ligurian Angel" reproduced on a red
ground rather than as a small pencil drawing on white paper, "The
Stratospheric Canticles" in blue on purple rather than as an ink sketch,
and already sold for a mere $150 framed (these are not prints), and a
two-color version of the cartographic "Towards the Primexal Lightning
Field".

As with his poetry, so Alexander's sketches and large oil pastels are
very much his own: mandalic, biomorphic, alternately figural and
abstract.  Alexander gave a brief reading, selecting his
painting-related works, which compare the graphite of regular pencils
mentioned below to mirror, and elucidate his inner vision as nerve cell
and x-ray and aura.  Of course, the price list alone is quite an item,
as it contains Alexander's statement:

"Line for me, is an organic movement by which the composition vibrates.
It is the molten which empowers the image, which magnetizes the force in
the eye of the viewer.  In my compositions line has always implied
colour, the graphite has always been pregnant with pigment.  Each line
implies a cerulean, a magenta.  In this way, line and colour become
fused, simultaneous, inevitable, in conveying the oneiric flame of the
"interior model"."

as well as the price list, which lists out the titles.  Unsold in
approximate order of composition:

Post-Tellurian Hypnotic, Indian Solar Magnetics, Personage Clothed in
Italian Penumbra, The Dawn Goddess, Incendiary Spirals, The Eye as
Blacked Syllabus, The Dawn God, The Alpestrine Vapours, Rubescent
Maritime Goddess, Ligurian Angel, The Transpicious Vase, The Varicolored
Table, and Subconscious Siluriain Being

The pastels are vividly lineated on a green field, and most are matted
with red.  Some of the older sketches are not on acid-free paper, and
while the rhythms of the small pen sketch "Incendiary Spirals" (the
title of the show given in the Beyond Baroque calendar) recalls Matisse,
the paper has been folded.  Alexander continues to work the border
between outsider and high art.  His initial impetus towards visual art
was seeing Lorca's sketches, while the work itself is Blakean.  There
are many spiral and wheel forms, many eye and feather forms.  The
paradox of non-linear lineated writing presists in this
literature-informed visual work.

Beyond Baroque, through May.

His "lecture" Thursday night, surrounded by as many of his pictures as
he could cram into the tiny white room, is expected to be pretty
special.

Catherine Daly

Clouds & Green Police

by Robert Gregory

Robert Gregory is the author of two books of poems, Interferences (San
Francisco: Poltroon Press, 1987) and Boy Picked Up By The Wind (Emporia,
KS: Bluestem, 1992). Poems recent or forthcoming in Terra Incognita,
Hanging Loose, Many Mountains Moving, Poetry Motel, and Willow Springs.
Has also published essays and short fiction.

Here is the first poem from Clouds & Green Police:

Two Sisters Who Had Wandered

two sisters who had wandered
met in a field by the riverside
the elder spoke and said
September, they say
continues very close
houses, neighbors, babies, they say,
will go to ashes in the burning world someday

I tasted sweetness, the other said, yesterday
the day before it rained so much, there was general disorder
the spirit in the house made shaking, noise, and clamor
Elias Miller of our town had a horse killed by lightning
I was detained at Mother's by the rain

what else did she see?
the dance of the blessed
skeletons and lutes
burning spirits, a scorpion, a bird-man

what else did she tell about?
invisible spirits, a dog-face
a surplus maidenhood, a stranger

what else?
that there is music in the motions of heaven, they say
that even all this is nothing they say
to what will turn and drift upward, as light as a girl
inside the burning eye of grace

What else? There are twenty-three more poems in Robert Gregory's
collection. Read them and spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Looking for studiomate:

The space is a work-only studio share in Williamsburg and is located on
Macarin Park. Great view overlooks the park (soccer games in summer!) and
Manhattan skyline. The light is south-west. Also, a fantastic roof.

550 sq. feet for $340 per month, which also covers heat and electricity.

Your studio mate, Richard O'Russa, is mainly painting small oils and
gouaches, which take up one of two walls (you would have the other). He's
there mainly on weekends and weeknights. Since there are a ton of artist
studios in this building, people are asked to be generally quiet and
chemical odor-free (no kilns, welding or spray-painting projects).

It's a newly built space and in great shape.

If you're interested, call Rich at home (212) 358-8548 or at work (212)
334-6585.

Thanks!
Marcella

Subject:      'oh yes to write so childlike', said jennifer
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

thank you alan sondheim and jennifer!



it reminds me of something from 'Gitanjali (song offerings)' by
Rabindranath Tagore (Macmillan, London 1913), section 60:


'...On the seashore of endless worlds children meet. The infinite sky
is motionless overhead and the restelss water is boisterous. On the
seashore of endless worlds the children meet with shouts and dances.

    'They build their houses with sand and they play with empty
shells. With withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly
float them on the vast deep. Children have their play on the seashore
of worlds.

    'They know not how to swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl
fishers dive for pearls, merchants sail in their ships, while
children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They seek not for
hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.'

W B Yeats quoted some of this in the introduction - after writing:

'We write long books where no page perhaps has any quality to make
writing a pleasure, being confident in some general design, just as
we fight and make money and fill our heads with politics - all dull
things in the doing - while Mr Tagore ... has been content to
discover the soul and surrender himself to its spontaneity ... '

...I know very well that such words and thoughts can nowadays be
analysed into perceived bias or into nothingness ... but ... but ...
oh yes ... oh yes ... 'you can lose weight by devouring this book'
says the advertisement that appears alongside as I type...



Is it possible that by now the softness of English poetry of the time
of Yeats and of Tagore can be re-admitted into serious poetic
discussion - thanks to such resonances as these, and softly and
soundly and losing some distinctions, and children also?

But in any case I like what you wrote...

(I've not read the previous discussion - I hope it does not
invalidate these remarks.)

Small Press Traffic
presents

a Crosstown Traffic event:
Sunday, March 25th at 2pm
Timken Lecture Hall
CCAC San Francisco campus
1111 8th Street, San Francisco

Sang Singing Sung Trio
Kattt Sammon (voice)
Ron Heglin (voice)
Bob Marsh (voice)

"The Sang Singing Sung Trio has no stock phrases, no correct responses, nor
any route that should be followed, because we feel all that is sang, singing
and sung has been done. In our work together, we have found that by not
restricting our voice to any one particular style we open up entire worlds
of sound and texture possibilities.

The work of the Sang Singing Sung Trio is dedicated to using the full
spectrum of the voice as an instrument itself. For this performance, we will
perform written compositions, as well as spontaneous collaborative
compositions that will incorporate singing, screaming, chanting, words,
gibberish, sighing, yawning, crying, sneezing, coughing, whispering,
breathing, laughing, popping, gasping and whatever sound our voices are
capable of making for the sake of the composition."
------------------

Kattt Sammon (mezzo-soprano) started out in Dallas radio. She has studied
singing voice with Laurie Amat, Indian vocal music with Sri Karanumayee, as
well as voice, movement and acting with Lissa Tyler Renaud.  Movement
studies have included the work of Moshe Feldenkrais, Rudolph Laban, Andre
Bernard and Bonnie Bainridge Cohen.  She has performed at the Creative Music
Series' at Beanbenders, Luggage Store Gallery, Starry Plough, as well as
23ten Sound Gallery, Moving Targets, New Langton, 21Grand, 848 Space, and
The Lab. She has performed with such Bay Area Improvisers Aaron Bennett,
Adam Lane, Marianne McDonald, Tim Perkis, Tom Nunn and others. Ms. Sammon
has also appeared in performance art pieces with Margaret Tedesco, Gerhard
Staebler and Kunsu Shim.


Ron Heglin is a trombonist and vocalist doing both compositional and
improvisational music. He has studied at the Center for World Music, Ali
Akbar Khan College and Indian Vocal Music with Pandit Pran Nath. Mr Heglin
has performed in ensemble and solo through out Europe and the United States.


Bob Marsh is a composer and performs regularly on violin, cello, piano,
vibraphone, flute, and uses extended vocal techniques. Mr. Marsh is the
founder of the Quintessentials, the Emergency String Quartet and the
Emergency Piano Quintet. He has performed with Jim Baker, Gene Coleman,
Ernesto Diaz-Infante, Carol Genetti, Adam Lane, Aaron Bennett, Fred
Lonberg-Holm, Toshi Makihara, Tatsuya Nakatani, Bob Faslech, Bhob Rainey,
Ken Vandermark, Sue Wolf, and many others. He has also performed and
recorded extensively with saxophonist Jack Wright.

Dear J,

I not nothing of the people on the LA Times award and I am sure that they
aren't members as I have never seen their names before. And no I don't have
me head under a rock! I am sure that they are fine people and fine poets ...
so, I say we eat them !

With only 1,768 votes cast as of a minute ago, there's a real chance for the
666 people on this list to make an impact here.

( http://www.poets.org/npm/nominations/Vote.cfm )

I was surprised that no one had even nominated Ashbery until I got there,
but then "National Poetry Month" is shutting out T.S. Eliot 10-0 as a
favorite writer among the people who have voted so far...

Ah, but it's worse than that.  Godel proved in 1931 that in any
system which resembles the way we do mathematics enough to have
recognizable (to us) proofs and basic arithmetic necessarily has
statements which can neither be proven no disproven.  Such statements
are called undecidable.  Of course what is undecidable in one system
is a theorem in another --- take the statement as an axiom, e.g.

I've been gone and maybe someone's already said this, but in case
they haven't...

(P.S.  Nearly all my mathematical work is connected in some way to
undecidability.  Most mathematicians, on the other hand, have no
truck with it, avoid it whenever posible.)

Geraldine. Nothing is obvious. But when I used the term losers I was
emphasising something. There are a lot of Kiwis who are (well they're just
that). (The problem I think is partly the medium of the email: communication
is less effective in some cases because I (and others) cant show facial
expressions or give tone of voice and so on).A lot of people, myself
included, choose not to work: but that's different from losers...its
probably not a good term, but I wanted to add emphasis. Sure, there are some
people who need social assistance in every country (therre are a lot of
people who are "hurting", I know that...but the "losers" I mean are people
who imagine that because of some external thing they've "lost out".Bitter
people who keep looking at the car beside them or are envious of eg people
in "flash" houses. Instead of setting goals (if they want such things) or
studying, they "whinge" a lot and often they are racists. Ultimately they
are people who lack self approbation and self reliance: they are losers in
the sense that they cant see that to "win" one doesnt need masses of
material things. A person on the dole or a billionaire can be equally happy
(or unhappy): the winners as I define them are those who are happy most of
the time. They bear no rancour to others who may be either millionairs or
better looking than them or can run faster or whatever. So I think you
misunderstood what I was saying.
  I'm not advocating a right wing approach. My email originally had as its
main point a question to the effect: will racialism and all the othe "isms"
gradually wither away as the standard of living gradually and happily
increases for people all over the world? My friend believes that as
racialism doesnt manifest itself anywhere to any critical extent  we now
have very few concerns. He dislikes the excessive "political correctness"
that (he feels) prevails...often to the advantage (he feels) of minority
groups, many of whom get Govt assistance and are promoted to make things
look good...he feels that this has gone too far. He is NOT me: these are,
loosely, his views. I maintain that racialism etc (is) are still there and
that people need to understand the reality of the world situation at least.
  Idont want to quibble over whether I am sounding like (whatever) I wanted
to ask the group what they thought. Also, how do these things interact with
literature etc? Does anyone care? I mean Rita Dove and Maya Angelou seem to
have it pretty good. The talk back host (sorry blank) who is black is a
millionaire. Toni Morrison will be earning far in excess of my income and so
on. (these are the sort of arguments my friend might propose.) Black people
dont get lynched (to the extent that they did in the sixties or earlier) and
racialism is "dying out" as people "naturally" and peacefully become
enlightened beecause they are better educated etc Of course (as my mate
says) there's some racialism  in Europe but its confined mainly to East
Germany and Yugoslavia (I pointerd out that in THAT country people seemed
rather fond of slaughtering each other for "ethnic" reasons) he feels was
rather backward and isolated and cant be taken as an example. He voted for
the NZ Labour Party and the British (when he was there) and feels that (as
long as "globalisation" -which he is very worried about for some reason - is
kept in check) everything is bobsydai.....so those are (maybe a bit crudely
represented by me but fundamentally true) the views of my liberal working
class friend. He also doesnt agree with my contention that the working class
(especially tradsmen (he'd hate tradespeople) are the most violently and
viciously right wing in many cases (about 80% from my life and work
experience having worked mainly in labouring and factory jobs in my life and
living in a working class area of Aucland and so on)...which we found in
1981 here when rugby players tried to kill anti-apartheid protestors
(against the Springbok Rugby tour). He feels that that has changed and that
racialism isnt a problem, and will "wither away" as long as we dont get too
"postmodernist" as he puts it (he feels "postmodernism" is a plot against
science etc)
   Why is Australia on the verge of a recession? There have been recessions,
depressions,uptions throughout my 53 years on this planet and none of them
have mattered tuppence...most people get by. Aussie are great fighters for
C's sake! Nothing to worry about there. Brilliant cricket team...I'm a great
fan of Shane Warn: marvellous spin bowler...Come on... a pessimistic Aussie?
No such thing!
   Anyway, what do you think of some of those things? (Now that you know I'm
not a rabid "anti-dolebludgerite?"). Hope all is well. Regards, Richard.

In a recent post, Michael Amberwind said:

"i've always considered the canadian vehemence against being considered or
compared to americans just a touch too hysterical to be mere patriotism - "

Maybe the fact that ninety per cent of Candians live within one hundred
miles of the most powerful civilisation in the history of the world has
some thing to do with it -- gigawatts of radio and televison blaring over
the border, unstoppable.

We Australians sometimes bemoan the fact that we're twelve thousand miles
from anywhere, but that does have its advantages.

anti-codework


hide the uninteresting code; textured meta-levels are icons of the future,
greater and lesser worlds: build worlds, worldings: hide the code which
only obscures semantic flows. think of this _text_ as a _world_ speaking
and spoken-for; ignore the letters and their mappings: focus on the
presence of a white dress and sullen face before you on the path; ignore
the syntactics leading to the scene of the lurid blood-red room; focus on
tumescent bodies everywhere for the taking. code articulates the falsity
of cartesian-aristotelian truths, truth-tables; it constructs, emerges,
from proprietary etiquette, summarized knowledge and knowledge-owners,
programmers and heroic hackers. focus on the faces, mouths open, pouting
lips, as your sullen face turns slowly, as you descend the path; imagine
the path; descend into the room below. {focus on blurred truths, blurred
faces; focus on truth's absence; on the scents and odors; focus on the
smells.}

what is the author saying?

why does she hate codework so?

Yes, I can too understand those arguments.  I also, for better or for worse,
happen to be a programmer.  Instructions to a machine can be pretty, in a
sense, but they are nothing like poetry.  If anything, poetry that is
written like code appears to me to be poetry "trapped" in a machine.  As if
machine-nature is somehow antithetical to poetry.

http://proximate.org/01d3c0d3.htm

http://proximate.org/subterra.htm

surrealism was different than hypertextpo.  in surrealism, the parataxis of
the language placed demands upon the viewer to create and invent.  placing
that interaction into a mouse click removes the imagination and places it in
the novelty of clicking and spawning.  if you and mez and many others (alan
sondheim, steven duffy) are extending the parataxis, well, that's nothing
new, but it is a progression of the old.

but yes.  but it's also the den of surveillance and behavior-prediction
matrices and other highly advanced people-control technologies that are
dependent upon this realm of apparent infinite freedom.

Is it computer-dependent or internet-dependent?  The basis for my position
was that it is NOT.  The cut-up was in existence long before computers.  The
computer perhaps enhances our ability to do that, but there is little that's
poetic about the ability to do that.  I am also a sort of cut and paste
poet.  I also write in other ways, but cut-up writing helped me learn how to
write.    even when i do cut-ups i edit heavily.  i have "my" hands all over
it.  when we leave machines to decide and interfere with our imaginations,
we start moving away from the language.  we give poetry to the machines.
and if we give poetry to the machines of this supposed loving grace, why not
our leadership, our friendship, to it as well?  Hypertext confines this
space to automatic and confined creation.  it is still poetry, but it still
in theory as closed as any piece by muriel rukeyser or robert frost.  the
difference is that the automatic enforcement is still heavily parameterized.
your cutting up, and mez's are similar to mine, although with different
affect.  if we make the users click to use their imaginations, though, their
imaginations will shrink, just as the Big Machine wants them to do.  all I'm
really criticizing here is the hypertext material.  not parataxis.  process
poetry does rest in a gray area for me, so I will leave it alone for now.

looming above so much of i say is the Turing test.  i don't quite know how
to respond to that except to say that text itself is sort of devoid of
humanness, a sort of technology.

perhaps the best use of the internet in terms of poetry is recording.  who
knows.

i like parataxis but just as it opens up meaning it could also begin to
cordon off meaning when left solely to the cycles of a CPU and the limited
click interface of an otherwise passive viewer.  parataxis for parataxis'
sake is not always interesting to me.  i think there has to be a human
spirit involved in a meaningful way.  whatever that means, right?  i see
something human in mez's writing.  it's a language that bleeds and i like
that too.

3d poetry just seems to be some sort of technologically-driven overt
synthesis, a sort of opportunism into the next niche.  Where's the spirit in
parataxis?  Having said that, I do not think parataxis specifically makes
for any sort of lack of poetry.  it surely can be poetry.  i won't argue
with that.   but i do not see anything interesting in having words represent
other words.  there's too much difficulty in translation.  there are already
enough problems with translation as it is.  now, if words are gestic in the
sense that they interact with the reader to provoke some sort of emotional
condition regardless of image, that's interesting to me.

for me there has to be some sort of tension between the parameterization of
meaning to exactness and the lack of any parameters at all.  poems to either
extreme do not interest me.  poems that synthesize both are not naturally
interesting to me either, but they have a better chance in "my" book.

i am familiar with mez pan.  I do think this is another legitimate and
poetic investigation.  but it's not specific to internet nor is it
exclusively the domain of poetry, nor is it made possible only by computers.
For this I refer to the art of opening credits in film.  that sort of
material did not require computer technology and does exactly what you
describe above.  i don't know if it is poetry or verse but it is art.

>
> so i believe i am making a new kind of poetry.

yes you are.  i believe I am moving along an old sort of poetry.  it's a
matter of perspective, of course.  we are doing different things that seem
not to conflict with each other.  but in a sense neither of us are doing
anything that was not possible without computers in the ultimate sense, and
neither of us is doing something that did not arise out of the heap of the
endless yesterday.  even 3d poetry is possible.  you could do it in bronze
for example.

but formal aspects alone do not a poetry make, right?  the content, what is
being said, is just as important if not more important to poetry than form.
i think the reality of prose poetry underscores what I am saying.  but i
think even the form of your efforts do subvert forced parameters and open
language.

one thing that i do avoid saying here is that I do believe in "the voice,"
but in the classical sense.  That is why I am so interested in
post-authorship, because when I write it seems never to be me that's
writing, whether it's literally true (in the process of cut-ups, the phrases
are co-opted) or somewhat true (my hands just start writing, and there's
this uncontrollable urge coming from out of nowhere, writing that is not
limited to "me" and my personal experiences.  usually when I read it for the
first time, I've never actually read or heard that poem before, even though
my hands composed it.  it is a very weird yet revelatory experience, at
least in terms of identity.

one thing i will persist in asking:  what aspects of your and mez's writing
make it poetic other than form?  I am not offering a criticism; I am asking
a question in all sincerity, since I do not know your writing well enough to
answer that question.

Thanks for your thoughtful and provocative reply.

I've often found the Lambda listings for Science Fiction/Mystery/Horror (did
they always lump all the "genre writing" into one category?) far more
interesting than the mainstream fiction category. Wonder why that is?

Hi everyone, just an addendum regarding the Lambda literary awards,
about which Ron Silliman posted here last month, citing them as an
example of how "short lists look like when people care enough to do
them right."

I was very happy when the organizers called and asked me to be a
judge for the novel category (novels written by men), because so many
wonderful novels happened to have been issued in 2000, and then they
told me the finalists had already been chosen, and surprise!  None of
the books I had in mind appeared on the list!  Indeed the five
nominees are all to one degree or another exercises in the same
tedious realism that have dominated this award from the beginning!
Apparently a team of 'experts' goes in and weeds out all the
experimental and otherwise interesting work from the list before the
judges get to vote.  I would happily have given the prize to either
Stephen Beachy ("Distortion"), Dennis Cooper ("Period"), or Lawrence
Braithwaite ("Ratz are Nice")--I CAN'T REMEMBER IF I CAN USE THE WORD
"EITHER" WHEN TALKING ABOUT THREE THINGS!!!  Anyway all 3 books are
ENDURING MASTERPIECES compared to the books that were actually
nominated!!!  and then there was a whole bunch of novels on a
slightly lower tier of accomplishment (than my big 3, including very
fine books by Brad Gooch, Brian Pera, C. Bard Cole, Brian Bouldrey
etc etc.  But instead I'm stuck with some REAL SNORERS.  Funny though
that the corresponding women's category is largely or entirely of
experimental work, though here again they left out the novel of the
year (Eileen Myles' "Cool for You.")  Why is this?  --

Mobilization for global justice


The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives is about to launch a new,
detailed briefing paper on the Free Trade Area of the Americas, called
"Inside the Fortress: What's going on at the FTAA negotiations", by Marc
Lee, an Economist in the BC office of the CCPA.


This paper looks at the structure and process of the FTAA negotiations to
date, and the strategic dynamics of the hemisphere (in particular, Latin
America). Then the paper looks at the specific issues on the table in the
negotiations, and what they imply for Canadians and others in the
Americas.


Below is the summary of the briefing paper. It is aimed at helping NGOs
and activists understand the dynamics and issues at stake in the FTAA
negotiations, and the connections to trade agreements like the NAFTA and
the WTO. While the FTAA represents an ambitious new attempt by trade
ideologues to push the envelope of trade and investment liberalization in
the Americas, the good news is that there are many cracks in the armour
of the FTAA. The process surrounding it, and the political will of the
nations involved, are not nearly as fortified as the walls of Quebec
City.


The briefing paper will be officially launched on March 29. Copies can be
ordered from the CCPA national office (613-563-1341, or can be downloaded
from the CCPA web site (http://www.policyalternatives.ca). The CCPA web
site also features a trade and investment briefing paper series, with
downloadable papers on the WTO's GATS and TRIPs Agreements, the Agreement
on Internal Trade, and more.

<bold>

**********


Summary: Inside the Fortress


</bold>When leaders from 34 nations in the Americas (Cuba is not invited)
meet in Quebec City in April, it will be more of a photo-op than a
serious negotiation. But this<italic> Summit of the Americas</italic>
will provide a high level endorsement of the progress so far towards a
Free Trade Area of the Americas, and will provide a push towards
completing the deal.


The Summit will also be attended by thousands of protesters that oppose
this bold new attempt to push the envelope of trade liberalization.
Quebec will likely set a new high water mark for irony when, surrounded
by protestors, insulated by the fortified walls of the old town and
guarded by a massive police presence, leaders will make speeches about
the benefits of trade, and will reaffirm their commitment to democracy.


Quebec will actually be the third Summit of the Americas. The Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA) was launched at the first Summit in Miami, in
December 1994. But the process was delayed due to the "peso crisis" which
hit Mexico shortly after, and spilled over onto the rest of Latin America
during 1995. It was not until the dust settled that the FTAA negotiations
were officially launched at the second Summit of the Americas in
Santiago, Chile, in April 1998.


In the three years since Santiago, trade negotiators have been working
away in nine negotiating groups, overseen by a trade negotiations
committee (with the fitting acronym of TNC). The TNC has compiled a draft
text that will be given the green light in Quebec and that will form the
basis of the "hardball" negotiations that will attempt to pull together a
final deal by the end of 2004.


The FTAA process has been gaining momentum since the collapse of the
Seattle WTO Ministerial in December 1999, and the failure to launch a new
round of multilateral trade talks. The business community has been well
represented through the Hemispheric Business Forum, which meets to
develop recommendations for Trade Ministers. Canada, through the
ideological zeal of our trade negotiators, has been a lead country in
keeping the process moving forward.


<bold>The Strategic Context of the Americas


</bold>In Latin America, globalization is nothing new. For the past two
decades, many Latin American countries have been saddled with high levels
of foreign debt. In order to gain access to the financial and economic
system of the North, they have required the seal of approval of the
International Monetary Fund. As a condition of receiving this approval,
these countries have had to implement numerous economic reforms known as
Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs).


IMF policies have required that countries:


<fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85</fontfamily> Reduce the public sector
by cutting back on public services like health care and education,
privatizing state enterprises, and deregulating the economy;

<fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85</fontfamily> Reorient the domestic
economy towards export production; and,

<fontfamily><param>Symbol</param>=85</fontfamily> Maintain high interest
rates in order to control inflation and stimulate the confidence of
foreign investors.


As a result, almost anyone on the street can give you an earful about the
impact of the IMF. However, trade agreements have not been on the public
radar, something that Latin American activists are in the process of
changing. While the IMF has been the battering ram that has forcibly
liberalized Latin America, trade agreements like the WTO and proposed
FTAA serve to lock this economic model in place. Unfortunately, this
model is based more on faith than hard evidence.


The legacy of SAPs in Latin America is that, having geared their
economies to export, many countries have become dependent on the US
market. Some see enhanced access to the US as the main outcome of the
negotiations. The US knows this and will try to trade off market access
for concessions in intellectual property, investment and services.


In the FTAA negotiations, as well as at the WTO, Latin Americans have
been grappling with how to deal with US power. One response has been to
develop regional trade blocs. On one hand, this merely mimics the
globalization process on a smaller scale; on the other hand, it offers
the opportunity to strengthen economic capabilities through a larger
regional market, while enhancing bargaining power at the negotiating
table.


Perhaps the most dynamic regional bloc is Mercosur, the Common Market of
the Southern Cone, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay. Mercosur countries are less reliant on the US market, trading
more with Europe. Last Fall, Mercosur agreed to join with the Andean
Community (representing most of the remaining South American countries)
into a South American Free Trade Agreement by January 2002. While this
raises important issues, many activists in South America see greater
potential for building on regional agreements as an alternative project
to casting their lot with an FTAA dominated by the US.


While the US is the biggest power in the negotiations, completing an FTAA
deal depends a great deal on Brazil, the largest Latin American economy.
Brazil has a lot to lose in the negotiations and has been lukewarm to the
FTAA, instead favouring Mercosur as an alternative. Trade tensions
between Brazil and Canada include ongoing skirmishes of jet aircraft
subsidies, and more recently, accusations over mad cow disease in
Brazilian cattle. Brazil has also had major disagreements with the US
over intellectual property.


Other factors could affect the FTAA negotiations as well. The US "Plan
Colombia" has upset many people in Latin America, and could undermine
support for a deal. Political instability is also a factor in Bolivia,
Peru and Ecuador. And Venezuela, under President Hugo Chavez, has been a
thorn in the US side. Finally, trade tensions between Canada and the US
could heat up, with the end of the Softwood Lumber Agreement, and threats
from the US to impose punitive duties on Canadian lumber exports.



<bold>The FTAA Negotiations


</bold>The two most relevant agreements for understanding the FTAA
negotiations are the WTO and NAFTA. With few exceptions, the NAFTA goes
deeper in terms of liberalization than the WTO. Indeed, the NAFTA text
has been highly influential in entrenching similar language in the
Agreements of the World Trade Organization.


The WTO permits member countries to enter regional economic integration
agreements, provided that these regional pacts have "substantial sectoral
coverage" and liberalize further than the WTO agreements. What this means
for the FTAA is that it must be "WTO plus," i.e. the sections of the
agreement must at least meet the WTO benchmarks for liberalization. Like
the NAFTA, the FTAA may also cover areas not currently in (or not fully
covered by) the WTO, such as common rules on investment, government
procurement and competition policy.


>From the perspective of Canadian and US negotiators, a NAFTA-like
agreement is the objective for the FTAA. The US would like an agreement
that makes it the hub economy to everyone else's spokes. The US also
views the FTAA negotiations as part of a broader strategic context with
regard to influencing negotiations in other arenas that involve big
players such as the EU and Japan. The US can use positions agreed to in
the FTAA to leverage gains on a multilateral basis at the WTO. In this
way, bilateral, regional and global trade initiatives reinforce one
another.


The tenor of the FTAA negotiations may also be affected if a new round of
WTO negotiations is successfully launched, and if so, by how expansive
the round will be. The next WTO Ministerial is now scheduled for November
2001 in the desert kingdom of Qatar, far away from pesky protesters.


Currently, the FTAA negotiations are caught up in procedural issues. Some
countries, like the US and Chile, want to accelerate the timeline for
completion of the deal, but this is being resisted by many South American
and Caribbean countries. There are disputes over when the "real
negotiations" will start, with some countries favouring a start date as
late as June 2002. And negotiators are still coming to grips with issues
around how the negotiating process will be structured.


A potential deal-breaker is the ability of new US President Bush to get
Fast Track negotiating authority from Congress. Fast Track means that
deals negotiated by the president are subject to a straight yes or no
vote in Congress. Without Fast Track, domestic political considerations
would mean that Congress would pick apart a deal and demand additional
concessions before approval. Other countries would effectively need to
negotiate twice with the US, something no one is inclined to do.


Nonetheless, a draft "bracketed text" has been compiled (brackets
indicate areas of disagreement). This is a compilation of the many
different proposals that have been put forward to date. This text has not
been publicly released. Both Canada and the US have posted information
about their positions on the web, although their usefulness is
questionable. Despite taking a leadership role in the FTAA process,
Canada has not submitted official positions (or has not made them public)
on services, investment and dispute settlement-the most controversial
areas of the FTAA.


Perhaps the biggest danger in the FTAA is an expansion of the NAFTA
investor-state dispute settlement process, which enables foreign
corporations to directly sue national governments through a "kangaroo
court" that bypasses national judicial systems. Claims can be made for
any action by government that is deemed to "expropriate" the
corporation's current or future profits. Numerous cases to date under the
NAFTA have targetted Canadian laws and regulations in the public
interest. Trade Minister Pierre Pettigrew has repeatedly stated that he
will not sign onto a NAFTA-style investor-state mechanism, but his
careful choice of words suggests that he and Canada's trade bureaucrats
still support investor-state in principle.


The FTAA Services negotiations pose challenges to public services and
domestic regulation. The issues in this area parallel the WTO's GATS
negotiations, and will be influenced by the "progress" made there. The US
is pushing for a "top-down" formulation, meaning all sectors are covered
except for those explicitly negotiated off the table. Other countries are
resisting this approach, but it is possible that the FTAA services
chapter could go much deeper than the GATS.


There are other areas of importance to Canadians that have not been
addressed by Canadian negotiators. In Agriculture, the US is targetting
state trading enterprises, like the Canadian Wheat Board, and supply
management programs in dairy, eggs and poultry. Both are institutional
structures designed to ensure stable incomes for farmers. Yet, in spite
of the crisis on Canadian farms in recent years, Canada does not even
mention these in its public negotiating positions.


In the area of Competition Policy, the US is recommending rules that
attack the viability of Crown corporations. Again, Canada is silent on
this issue.


Also on the table are proposals to open up government procurement
practices across the hemisphere, new rules to strengthen intellectual
property protection, and a new forum for the settlement of trade
disputes.


At this point in time, it is impossible to know what the full
implications of a completed FTAA would be. But the broad range of issues
being discussed, and the failure of Canadian negotiators to look beyond
"export opportunities for Canadian companies," is definitely cause for
concern.


The bottom line is that the FTAA embodies the worst aspects of the WTO
and the NAFTA. It deepens a globalization process that is fundamentally
about enhancing the rights of corporations, while disarming governments
and citizens. The FTAA is anti-democratic, and should be rejected by the
people of the hemisphere.

Judy etal. My reply to the Rev(X?) started all this. But, as has been
pointed out, that pi is irrational etc doesnt precluding it having a value,
nor, maybe, is it in the realm of "undecidability". But it points (not so
much to mysterious "golden" numbers - which we all probably are more
fascinated by than "solutions" (with some exceptions if your solution earns
you a cheque say as a programmer or engineer): and like all the "great"
people I'm quite fascinated by numbers etc but I think I chose the wrong
example. One (or I myself) could stay inside being a "bush" philosopher and
simply comment on the mystery of consciousness, the difficulties
(impossibilities of "perfect" measurements (which indeed are not quite the
same as numbers)).
  You would now the parallels say with "higher" or "pure" (if there's such a
thing) mathematics and science and creative things such as poetry, art...Art
if you like. Not to become obsessed with numbers...like Zukofsky
etal...altho one can take "poetic licence " as a I did in this remembrance
of learning about pi. We had a marvellous teacher who got us to  cut a strip
thru a disc of card board and thus "discover " pi. (By placing it around the
circumference of the rejoined circular disc).Also she had an old kerosene
tin which she heated on a stove, put the lid on, and then poured cold water
on it -bang!! It crumpled. I was about 12 at a local school (Auckland,NZ)
and that was to me a marvellous demonstration of atmospheric pressure.
Here's my pi poem:...no, I have to go for a walk or a  run etc so I'll put
it in another email.....Maths...yes even looking at an engineering book or
advanced maths  and reading it is an experience...naturally, most of its
incomprehensible...like reading Chinese or Hungarian to me (infact just
about every language except English)...I had read about the Godel theorem
but its a bit out of my ken ...one "half-wishes" one (I) had the requisite
no. of brain cells to decipher some if not more than some of it.....ah,
well.... Cheers to you and others, Richard Taylor.

A WRITING WORKSHOP TAUGHT BY ALLISON ADELLE HEDGE COKE
(See bio for March 21st reading.) The theme of this workshop will be writing
from life with a focus on incorporating the beautiful and the horrendous,
and creating tensions by coupling the two within a fabric of work. The class
will include a writing assignment and discussion. This workshop has been
made possible by a generous grant from the Jerome Foundation.

ALLISON ADELLE HEDGE COKE AND ELINOR NAUEN
"These are songs of righteous anger and utter beauty," writes Joy Harjo of
Allison Adelle Hedge Coke's poems in Dog Road Woman. Ms. Hedge Coke has
co-edited two collections of Native American poetry and writing, Voices of
Thunder and It's Not Quiet Anymore. In Dog Road Woman, Ms. Hedge Coke's
debut collection of poems, she presents an autobiographical sketch of a
contemporary mixed-blood native life. Elinor Nauen's books of poetry include
American Guys (Hanging Loose, 1997) and CARS & Other Poems (Misty Terrace
Press). "Her work is boyish girlish. Though it's not trans-gender, it's
trans-William Carlos Williams. ... In American Guys, all parts of the reader
get satisfied, even ones she didn't know she had," writes Eileen Myles.

without arguing with your foregoing analysis, I'm left wondering:

1) how do you demarcate "it" -- where do you think it begins and, more
poignantly, ends?

2) what's your demolition plan?

Subject:      Acting Classes with Non-traditional Texts
Mime-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

Hello everybody...My name is Tony Torn and I am currently acting in Richard
Foreman's play NOW THAT COMMUNISM IS DEAD MY LIFE FEELS EMPTY at St. Mark's
Church's Ontological Hysteric Theater in NYC.  I am, for the first time,
starting an acting class. I am beginning with a five week workshop that
begins March 16th. My class runs friday from 12-3pm. My class is a
traditional scene study class for non-traditional texts. Also teaching
classes are Tom Pearl, whose vocal technique class precedes mine at 10am (I
highly recommend that you take his class in tandem with mine...there will be
a discount if you double up) and Michael McCartney, whose basic style class
(an excellent choice for people interested in a more physical approach) is
Sat from 12-3pm, also preceded by Tom at 10am.

This is a exciting experiment for me, and I would love to see friendly faces
in the classroom. Also, please spread the word for me, if anyone is looking
for a good, reasonably priced class. My five week workshop is priced at
$150, which breaks down to $10 an hour...a very good deal.

> Subject: Gallery Report:  Will Alexander at Beyond Baroque
>
> Last night Will Alexander opened his first show, in the tiny upstairs
> gallery at Beyond Baroque where he occasionally teaches his free
> vertiginous collaborative ars poetica, which is unsurprisingly currently
> based on readings in the letters of surrealist painters Miro, de
> Chirico, et.al.  The pictures are a "tip of the iceberg" selection of 15
> years' work.  Alexander currently works mostly in dry media since he has
> no studio space.
>
> If you are familiar with the physical objects of his books STRATOSPHERIC
> CANTICLES, ABOVE THE HUMAN NERVE DOMAIN, and TOWARDS THE PRIMEVAL
> LIGHTNING FIELD, you have seen "Ligurian Angel" reproduced on a red
> ground rather than as a small pencil drawing on white paper, "The
> Stratospheric Canticles" in blue on purple rather than as an ink sketch,
> and already sold for a mere $150 framed (these are not prints), and a
> two-color version of the cartographic "Towards the Primexal Lightning
> Field".
>
> As with his poetry, so Alexander's sketches and large oil pastels are
> very much his own: mandalic, biomorphic, alternately figural and
> abstract.  Alexander gave a brief reading, selecting his
> painting-related works, which compare the graphite of regular pencils
> mentioned below to mirror, and elucidate his inner vision as nerve cell
> and x-ray and aura.  Of course, the price list alone is quite an item,
> as it contains Alexander's statement:
>
> "Line for me, is an organic movement by which the composition vibrates.
> It is the molten which empowers the image, which magnetizes the force in
> the eye of the viewer.  In my compositions line has always implied
> colour, the graphite has always been pregnant with pigment.  Each line
> implies a cerulean, a magenta.  In this way, line and colour become
> fused, simultaneous, inevitable, in conveying the oneiric flame of the
> "interior model"."
>
> as well as the price list, which lists out the titles.  Unsold in
> approximate order of composition:
>
> Post-Tellurian Hypnotic, Indian Solar Magnetics, Personage Clothed in
> Italian Penumbra, The Dawn Goddess, Incendiary Spirals, The Eye as
> Blacked Syllabus, The Dawn God, The Alpestrine Vapours, Rubescent
> Maritime Goddess, Ligurian Angel, The Transpicious Vase, The Varicolored
> Table, and Subconscious Siluriain Being
>
> The pastels are vividly lineated on a green field, and most are matted
> with red.  Some of the older sketches are not on acid-free paper, and
> while the rhythms of the small pen sketch "Incendiary Spirals" (the
> title of the show given in the Beyond Baroque calendar) recalls Matisse,
> the paper has been folded.  Alexander continues to work the border
> between outsider and high art.  His initial impetus towards visual art
> was seeing Lorca's sketches, while the work itself is Blakean.  There
> are many spiral and wheel forms, many eye and feather forms.  The
> paradox of non-linear lineated writing presists in this
> literature-informed visual work.
>
> Beyond Baroque, through May.
>
> His "lecture" Thursday night, surrounded by as many of his pictures as
> he could cram into the tiny white room, is expected to be pretty
> special.

For St. Louisans among us...

*****

Please mark your calendars for this wonderful event!  and pass it on...

UNDERWOOD FOUR
a free day of poetry readings
celebrating the rich literary history
of St. Louis and its contemporary
poetry scene

saturday
march 24 2001
Soulard Coffee Garden
910 Geyer
4:00 - 10:00 pm

Underwood Four showcases twelve established area poets and six emerging
poets, allowing the audience an opportunity to hear fresh talent that may
not yet be recognized in national publications and journals while providing
a rich sampling of the work of more established poets who have been
cornerstones of both St. Louis and national poetry circles.

This year's readers have collectively written more than 15 poetry books and
have been featured in several prominent literary journals, including Paris
Review, River Styx, New England Review, Fence, Chelsea, and Denver
Quarterly.

Attendees are encouraged to bring a new book for donation to the "Drop
Everything and Read" program at Clark Elementary School on Union Blvd.,
which is working to increase the number of books available to children
through their school library.

This year's event features readings by

   Mary Jo Bang
   Ben Doyle
   Allison Funk
   Donald Finkel
   Jason Sommer
   Aaron Belz

and many others...

Just FYI, C-SPAN is doing a series of shows on "American Writers" and
the bizarre duo they've selected to represent the literary years
1945-1961 is, ta da, Jack Kerouac and Whittaker Chambers!?!

For those who don't know, Richard Nixon's career really started with
some microfilm hidden in a pumpkin on Chambers's Maryland farm. Yes,
it's true--you couldn't make this stuff up and you don't need to.
Chambers published a book called _Witness_, but as I understand it
that's the sum total of his writerly output.

What would Donald Allen have to say about all this?

John Gallaher wrote that we should come up with our
own book award, and I think this is a great idea.
There could be a nominations period, and then everyone
on the list could get one vote.  If everyone on the
list also agreed to donate a buck or two, we could
even give some cash.  And we could send out a release
about it to Poets & Writers and Rain Taxi and places
like that, just to get some added hoopla for the
writers.  If people are interested in doing such a
thing, I would be happy to 1) tally votes or 2) write
a press release.

I think the book award could be open to any book
published within the last year -- I'm sure with the
way that this list is skewed, most of the books would
be small press even if no official rule about such a
thing was given.

* Wednesday, April 11th: GEOFFREY YOUNG and MICHAEL GIZZI *

An art critic, publisher, poet, and curator, GEOFFREY YOUNG is the
author of, among other books, _Admiral Fever_, with drawings by
Philip Knoll, _Cerulean Embankments_ with drawings by Carroll Dunham,
and, with drawings by James Siena, _Pockets of Wheat_. Originally
from San Diego, Young currently lives in Great Barrington,
Massachusetts, where he is publisher of The Figures, a small press
that since its inception in 1975 has published more than 100 books of
poetry and art criticism (including the book _Rejection_ a
collaboration between Young and fellow reader Michael Gizzi).

    The new,
    being that which
    we will soon forget:

    "I'm speaking," she said,
    "I'm on fire. Nothing
    can stop the ocean
    when it's on fire."

    The new, being that
    which we will
    soon replace.

      -Geoffrey Young, "The New," from _Pockets of Wheat_. The Figures. 1998.


MICHAEL GIZZI's poems, according to Lisa Jarnot, are what happens
when you "cross James Joyce with Jack Nicholson in a high energy
construct machine." Among his numerous publications, spanning a
decades long career, are _Too Much Johnson_, No Both_,  _Just Like a
Real Italian Kid_, and the recent audio release (on compact disc)
_cured in the bebop morning_. He lives in Massachusetts.


        "...I feel
    every inversion to lay down my hay and
    submerge myself in some tidepool
    drawingroom before the glazier of
    autumn and the screwball at the cross-
    roads stir me out. Is it any wonder
    ivory hunters are music lovers or that
    black Irish are often black...?"

      _ Michael Gizzi, from _cured in the going bebop_. Utopia
Productions. 2000.

* Wednesday, April 18th: YUSEF  KOMUNYAKAA *

  Pulitzer prize winning poet YUSEF KOMUNYAKAA is the author of _Lost
in the Bonewheel Factory_, _Magic City_, Thieves of Paradise_, and
_Neon Vernacular: New and Selected Poems_. With Sascha Feinstein, he
edited _The Jazz Poetry Anthology_ and _The Second Set: The Jazz
Poetry Anthology, Volume 2_. A recipient of the Kingsley Tufts Award
and the William Faulkner Prize, Komunyakaa has recently recorded a
compact disc with jazz instrumentalist John Tchicai, _Love Notes from
the Madhouse_. He teaches Creative Writing at Princeton University.

   " Music is serious business in the African-
    American community because it is so intricately
    interwoven with our identity. Most of us don't
    have to strain to see those graceful, swaying
    shadows of contemporary America in cahoots
    with the night in Congo Square - committing an
    act of sabotage merely by dancing to keep the
    forbidden gods alive..."

      - from Robert Kelly, "Jazz and Poetry: A Conversation" (with
Yusef Komunyakaa and WIlliam Matthews. _Georgia Review_ 46:4 (Winter
1992)


   "the need gotta be basic
    animal need to see
    & know the terror
    we are made of honey
    cause if you wanna dance
    this boogie be ready
    to let the devil use your head
    for a drum"

      - from "Blue Light Lounge Sutra for the Performance Poets at
Harold Park Hotel" from _Neon Vernacular_ Wesleyan U. Press. 1993.

* Wednesday, April 25: HARRY MATHEWS *

An early member of the New York School of poets, writers, and
artists, HARRY MATHEWS founded, with John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch,  and
James Schuyler, the influential periodical _Locus Solus_ , and later
became a central member of the renowned experimental group Oulipo
(Ouvroir de Litterature Potentielle) that included, among others,
Italo Calvino, Raymond Queneau, and Georges Perec. Internationally
celebrated as a novelist, poet, translator, and experimentalist,
Mathews works include _Cigarettes: A Novel_, _Singular Pleasures_
(with illustrations by Francesco Clemente), _A Mid-Season Sky: Poems
1954-1991, and _Selected Declarations of Dependence_. He is visiting
San Diego from his home in Paris on a University of California
Regents Lectureship.


       "Why, is Pan in-flect? You ask. Once it was n't,
    then home the missions, be fore soldats and buyrs,
    monks mad for lingual avance. Yet, hlever, they
    forse not theyr linguage up on us, ownly show, the
    vantage of its struttures - of horse, we are
    peedisposed to these. They show howhow one
    word can to-be many, with a little twists, and
    we're reasn-like and order-most and the cort
    adops this eduhation..."

    "Throughout Mathews' work, his self-reflexivity
    is thoroughly grounded in macabre humor and
    encyclopedic speculations rendered all the more
    strange through his radically constrictive procedures.
    To read Harry Mathews' work [...] is to consider an
    astonishingly varied and rich collection of inquiries
    into the concept of authorship and the function of
    writing..."

      - Lytle Shaw, on Mathews's novel _The Journalist_, in _Idiom 2_

Some grossly over-rated wag, who was certainly no friend of mine, once
observed that "reviewing is not the expression of friendship, but an escape
into friendship."  Someone said, "the unfriendly writers are remote from us
because they KNOW so much more than we do."  Precisely, and they are that
which we do not know.  Let's keep it that way.  What happens when a new
work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to the
friends of all the works of art that preceded it.  The existing clique is
complete before the new poet arrives; the ideal order is modified by the
acceptance of a new friend within the clique.  The poet has, not an art to
express, but friendships to maintain, at least if publication is at all
desired.   John Wesley Harding was a friend to the poor, and you see where
that got him.

This is the theory of the objectionable relative, which I have neither time
nor inclination to explain or defend.

that a number of these messages, which materialized in our Inbox
some time during the last 20 hours, are actually from the 13th

especial attention to see that the event you've seen posted today,

Creative Writing, Drawing, Story Telling and Personal Memoir
Taught by writer Shelley Berc and multimedia artist Alejandro Fogel

We are all born creative, curious and imaginative but these qualities
sometimes fade with the passage of time. The Creativity Workshop's goal is
to help people get their imaginations back.
 Find your particular way of expression and break through the fears
associated with creation.
This internationally renowned intensive workshop brings together people of
all backgrounds, cultures, and interests to discover new and exciting tools
for generating creativity.

Award winning artists Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel bring their unique
vision to this workshop in which individuals can explore their own creative
potentials. This is a creative writing, drawing, and story telling workshop
that emphasizes the process of creative expression rather than
concentrating on finished products and seeks to erase the barriers between
art disciplines. The Workshop focuses on personal memories and how these
can be used in one's creative discoveries. Through a series of exercises
that stimulate the imagination, participants learn how to catch the moment
of inspiration and develop it, combat writer's block and stage fright, and
recapture the childhood joys of making new and wonderful visions out of the
most commonplace things. The Workshop concentrates on exploring various
tools of nurturing one's creativity such as visualization exercises, guided
automatic drawing and writing, map making, photography, miniature worlds,
and the use of 'show and tell' and puppets. We will use the local
environment and its culture and history to stimulate our writing, visual,
and story telling skills.

"The new millennium needs bold, creative men and women who can turn their
dreams into reality... Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel show how you can do
this through their challenging and inspiring creativity workshops...even a
simple first contact will prove what these two talented teachers can do for
your own gifts."
Dr. Kirpal Singh, Writer, Professor, Singapore Management University.

"The Creativity Workshop in Spoleto has been a very special experience for
me. It opened up new ways to look at my work and I found new friendships. I
spent 15 fantastic days in an incredible place. Shelley and Alejandro are
superb teachers!"
Vera Eisenberg, painter, Argentina

"The Workshop was such a powerful experience for me, something I never
expected nor would I ever be able to repeat it."
Rolfe Werner, Engineer. Canberra, Australia.

"I found the workshop extremely valuable in generating awareness of my
creativity and in stimulating ideas."
Jeanne Arthur, Executive Officer, ACT Board of Secondary School Studies.
Canberra, Australia.

"I feel as though I now have a focus, a method, a way of evolving my ideas
and that the means are just as important as the end. I have created
environments just to create in, and environments just to display the work
in. My vision of attending to each detail, sound, smell, texture,
substance... is starting to find a home. Thanks for opening my eyes to
these essential aspects of creating through your guidance and example."
Student. University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.

"This class was THE MOST enriching, enlightening, inspirational class I
have ever taken. The way I work and what I create will never be the same."
Student. University of Iowa, USA.

"Shelley and Alejandro's Creativity Workshop is amazing in that it breaks
down all your fears about thinking and writing. If it wasn't for them I
fear I never would have finished my master's thesis. I was blocked until I
took this course."
=46rancesca Salidu
PHD candidate in Shakespeare, University of Pisa. San Miniato, Italy.

"Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel taught their Creativity Workshop as
American Cultural Specialists under the United States Information Service
auspices. To say that they were extremely effective is a vast
understatement. I would unreservedly recommend their course. They have
abundant creativity, energy, and a wealth of skills."
Gloria Berbena, Asst. Cultural Attach=E9, US Information Service, US Embassy=
=2E
Rome, Italy.

"A special experience. Berc and Fogel opened us up to new and wonderful
ways of looking at our creativity."
Belkis Bottfeld, PHD, psychologist. Istanbul, Turkey.

"An unforgettable course!"
Gulnur Ayaz, MD. Istanbul, Turkey.

Under their guidance, participants explore their own creative processes
through different writing and drawing exercises. Berc and Fogel explain in
theory and demonstrate in practice the concepts of originality,
'appropriation', memory and imagination. They emphasize the intimate link
between personal and public spheres, individual and social practices,
history and myth, dream and reality. The focus of the workshop is on
process not product and to help participants find life-long tools of
creative expression.
Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have taught their Creativity Workshop
internationally. They have lectured on creativity and their own work at
universities and cultural centers throughout the world.
The Creativity Workshop is currently an intensive semester long course at
the International Writing Program of The University of Iowa.

Process not Product
The Creativity Workshop is for writers, painters, multimedia artists,
performers, teachers, business people and anyone interested in expanding
their creative potential. Shelley Berc and Alejandro Fogel have developed a
series of exercises focused on developing the creative process.
Participants explore different artistic materials and mediums in order to
discover their particular and individual ways of expression and to be able
to break through the fears that inhibit creativity.

Tools for a Lifetime
The exercises used in the Creativity Workshop are intended to become the
tools for a lifetime of creative expression. Participants are encouraged to
draw from all kinds of resources of creativity -such as the oral tradition,
dreams, childhood memories, sense perceptions and intuition.
Working both individually and in collaborative groups, participants explore
their imaginative potential through exercises in writing, drawing, collage,
map making, story telling and guided visualization.

The Teachers
Shelley Berc
is a writer and teacher. She is a professor of the International Writing
Program at the University of Iowa. Her novels, plays, and essays which
include 'The Shape of Wilderness', 'A Girl's Guide to the Divine Comedy'

Hopkins Press, Heinemann Books, Performing Arts Journal and Theatre
Communications Group Press. Her plays have been produced by theatres such
as the American Repertory Theatre, the Yale Rep, and the Edinburgh Festival.

is a visual artist and teacher working in painting, site installations,
video and digital art. He has exhibited his works in galleries and museums
in Argentina, Bulgaria, Cuba, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Netherlands,
Spain, United States and Germany. His installation 'Root to Route'

the USPS will not issue a stamp of a living person... or at least used

I wrote to them suggesting Larry Bird should be on the 33cent stamp and

Strangely enough-- it also links to my site, meaningless.com

I suppose if you link every word in an essay to its dot-com equivalent, and
the word "meaningless" is in the essay, that's going to happen.  You're
going to link to "meaningless.com".  It's practically inevitable.

I'm familiar with the work of both of these poets, and I must say that in my
humble view they cover very familiar ground.  Good poets both, but nothing
very innovative there.  So what's the reason for singling them out?  Best,

Yes, you are at least 12,000 miles away from the greatest landfill in the
world, the Lipari Landfill in beautiful Pitman, New Jersey, USA.  God bless
America.

I also found it rather hysterical in a different sense that Canadians make
sure they travel with Canadian flags on their backpacks.  Funny and sad.
When I was a student traveling in Europe I saw so many canadian flags on
backpacks, and each said they didn't  want to be confused for Americans.
But they were still typically wearing white tennis shoes and baseball caps.
I chalked it up as being a poorly developed and narrow display of prejudice,
especially with the white sneakers and caps and  that American LL Bean
duck-hunter & Nike World chic.  Most Europeans seemed to be annoyed by
americans on several levels: (1) 'we' wear white sneakers and baseball caps
(you will not catch me that way, no sir)  (2) we are typified as being
obnoxious, particularly the ones in white sneakers and baseball caps (3) we
are typified as politically ignorant, and naive about our role as global
hegemonists, particularly those of us in white sneakers aand baseball caps
(in Austria the youth would call Americans "Army" as a play on "Ami," their
shorthand for "American"), and (4) white Americans look, I was told, like
the produce of rejected ugly Europeans, like mongrels, or like jews.   Also
(5) only americans would go to a bar or cafe to read a book and (6)
Americans must be camels because they always have to have beverages with
them.  And despite those images, everywhere I went I heard the worst of
American pop music everywhere.

Of course, (4) ties in with some of Europe's ugly racist & nationalistic
history.  I remember being surprised at the level of anti-Semitism in
dialogue even in a city like Amsterdam.  It was awkward at the time to
explain to people I was hunting down my family's judaic roots when  I made
mention of such things and I heard apologetic questions about being a jew,
etc..  But then, a close friend of mine's grandfather was in the Dutch
Resistance, hid jews in his house, smuggled jews across borders during Nazi
occupation, etc, and my friend said his granddad was the biggest anti-Semite
he could ever imagine.   To experience such stereotypes, some amusing, some
disturbing, and then to see a Canadian in American-made cultural artifacts
with a Canadian flag on hir backpack walking by, was very odd.   I remember
being held as an exception in certain places, as I had neither white shoes
nor baseball caps.  I was asked at different times if I were British, Irish,
or Canadian.  Only if I was not with other Americans.  To be asked that,
from a European to an American, is supposedly a compliment.

I am convinced people are dumb all over.  Yes, the ambiguity is deliberate.
If people can read, they usually believe everything they read, whether
American, Canadian, Austrian, Malaysian, Russian, or Kenyan.

Dumb all over
yes we are
dumb all over
near and far
dumb all over
black and white
people we is not wrapped tight.

Small Press Traffic presents


Sarah Anne Cox & Stephen Ratcliffe


Friday, March 23, 2001 at 7:30 p.m.

We admire Sarah Anne Cox for her precision, her short lines which overflow
in the mind to create specific and timeless renderings of anarchy,
civility,
beauty, terror. She has immense senses of history and of humor. Her work
is grounded in her study of and play with ancient languages and texts. Her
poems
bind current political situations and popular culture to religious and
philosophical traditions in surprising and exciting ways. Cox is the
author of Home of
Grammar (Double Lucy, 1997) and definite articles (a+bend, 1999). Her
poetry and critical work has appeared in numerous journals, including
Arshile,
Five Fingers Review, How2, Scout, Syllogism, and Tripwire, and she is an
associate editor of Outlet. Cox rounds things out by singing with the band
heavenacid (http://www.heavenacid.com).


Stephen Ratcliffe has been working in poetry for thirty years and we have
a whole shelf of his distinguished books, including most recently Idea's
Mirror
(Potes & Poets Press, 1999) and Mallarme: poem in prose (Santa Barbara
Review, 1998). SOUND/system has been forthcoming from Sun & Moon
for--oh, for most of the 20th century. Another manuscript, Painting, was
chosen as a finalist in the 2000 National Poetry Series. Ratcliffe edits
Avenue B
Books and teaches at Mills College in Oakland. His new book, Listening to
Reading (SUNY Press, 2000) collects many of the sensitive essays on
post-modern poetry which have been fugitive for many years. Ratcliffe's
great strengths are a willingness to follow perception no matter where it
goes, a
steely stick-to-it-iveness that rivals Natty Bumppo's, and a deep genius
understanding of music and its character that robes his philosophic and
psychic
quests in starry mantles of delight.

I think that the way Richard is thinking about technology and innovation
here represents the way the conversation is often thought of.  The
conversation is thought of as "What can you do with the new technology that
you couldn't or could do before."  Alot of the debate around this (Demon
Analogy/AngelSoliloquey) thread (which has been really fascinating and
great all around, btw) seems to be about what can you do with the internet
that you can't do with pen and paper or a typewriter.  Richard has brought
in the idea (rightly (and I'm extrapolating a bit)) that we could go back
and say what can you do with pen and paper that you couldn't do with a
stick and slab of mud and knowledge of cuniform.  Thinking of the
discussion in that way is useful because there are things that we can do
with each of these mediums that is impossible with other mediums.

What I'd like to suggest, though, is that another angle/question/approach
to this question may be to look at new technological innovations and say
what ideas/words/images/concepts do these innovations make possible.
Instead of looking at what the innovations can literally do, look at what
kind of mental? social? (I'm not sure what the right word/s are) thoughts
these innovations give rise to.  For example, before the atom bomb was
created, humans had imagined a device/event/phenomenon that could destroy
large parts of the world and humanity.  It was called a variety of
different things and imagined in many different ways.  Once the atom bomb
was actually created, however, we had specific, practical language with
which to discuss not just the literal effects of the bomb but a whole range
of events in comparison to the bomb.  The internet may or may not offer
"actual" innovation and "true" "certifiable" differences from other
mediums, but think about the concepts/words/images/language that the
internet has introduced into the societies that it has touched.  To me,
that is the innovative power of new technology and discovery whatever it's
practical and literal use may be.  Inventions/discovery/change have
conceptual lives aside from their literal and practical lives.  Without the
invention of the lightbulb (and a few other things) we wouldn't have
lightbulbs going off over cartoon characters' heads everytime they had an
idea.

I hope this makes sense.  And, as I said, I've really enjoyed this
discussion and look forward to it continuing.  Thanks.

Ken

You might want to check out the collection of his pre- and post-crossover
fiction & journalism called _Ghosts on the Roof_ (1989). In particular his
story "Can You Make Out Their Voices?" (based on a 1931 agrarian uprising
in Arkansas) is a classic of American Communist fiction. Whittaker Chambers
is way more than a pumpkin joke LRSN

all,
 i know that this is going to more than needed. if you are really pissed
off about this then let me know. Dr. Leeson, I know that I owe you a
letter. Anyone else? I've become a bit of a media hose here.

look, if this is bad then please respect that i'm doing poetry here in

To All,

Recently published by Lynne Riener Publishers, Inc. is "The Desert
Shore" edited by Christopher Wise.  Primarily a collection of works on the
subjects of literature and literacy in Sahelian Africa, it does include a
truly inspired translation into English by Wise and Georg Guyelberger of
part of a Tuareg poetic epic by Hawad.  "Le coude grincant de
l'anarchie" becomes "Anarchy's Delirious Trek."  Edited with the
assistance of the American poet Bruce Beasley this poem is a fascinating
collision of the oral with the inscribed and definitely worth a look.

Hi. See my email to Franklin Bruno. As I said to him I thought this was an
attack a al eg the book "Intellectual Impotures" (Alan Sokal and Jean
Bricmont)....as a friend of mine and I have been arguing about ...well, what
he feels is the intrusion of "postmodernism" in science and the decline of
education (eg the aboandonment of "teaching grammar" per se and what he
terms rote learning...and the need for the European "canon" (a la Harold
Bloom)...ok its all a bit more complex than that. One of my arguments
"proved" that there had been no progress (ever, and there never would
be)...Jim the Ant (for it was none other than that very gentleman) blundered
by not counterattacking with "define progress" so I won that for now...but
he got a lot of points for his disquisition re Ireland (my defence of
bombing became a bit "over the top" and my logic got a bit shaky). Normally,
in the presence of say a Derridean (or some sort of New Agey anti-technology
(Greeny or someone) it would be incumbent on me to counter-punch on the wing
and come back with things like "What is water? An organic substance or
inorganic?" ..and so on.I would naturally invoke "commonsense" etc etc but
that wouldnt be very interesting
 Being (as I said ) not totally opposed to science but dolloping up great
dosages of enthusiatic scepticism....The amusing thing was that, because I
was in media of and with these vast (and immensely important for the welfare
of the "continuation of the species") discussions with The Ant I was a bit
"hyped up" and thought you were right wing scientists who were attacking me
for "stealing" and or misusing scientific and mathematical ideas (as in
"Intellectual Impotures") so it was...oh deary deary..such a muddle! Hence
my rather vociferous and "boots 'n all" sacrificial attack on your god
selves with my nonsensical literary project..Which huge diatribe having been
vomited forth from the guts of my rather ancient and heinous mentius corpus
I was much nonplussed and chagrined to discover that you and your friend had
published a poetical book and (were apparently ) "moonlighting" as
mathematicians. Not, I hasten to add, that that is not "cricket"...just that
one forgets there are anumber of people who are in both the "technical" and
the more "waffly" poeticy stuff. I do have some mathematical knowledge.
Mainly I_ used_ mathematics. Or the main application for me was
ubderstanding harmonics (in radio and microwave systems) dbm measurments,
voltage and current measurements, counting, ohms law. (In fact most of my
career in telecoms was spent digging holes to repair telphone cables or
installing telephones...pumping out manholes, crawling in rooves, and so
on..."hands on" stuff (even digging in cables by hand or pole holes)

But I wasnt postulating that pi wasnt precise...just that it showed (in one
way) how problematic it is to obtain absolutely acurate measurements. But I
should maybe have quoted Jacob Bronowski who has a marvellous chapter on
these matters (including reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle)
in fact, in the chapter on that (and in the televisions series) Bronowski
begins the relevant chapter: (Knowledge or Certainty)with:  "One aim of the
physical sciences has been to give an exact picture of the material world.
One acheivement of physics in the twentieth century is to prove that that
aim is unnaattainable." But I think this is worth quoting (as a "devil's
advocate" I must, I must):

 "It is said that science will dehumanise people and turn them into numbers.
That is is false, tragically false. Look for yourself  [as a  Polish Jew, he
is standing in a field where the death camp Auscwitz stood, picking up the
mud and human ash and letting it fall through his fingers] This is the
concentration camp and crematorium at Auschwitz. This is where people were
turned into numbers. Into this pond were flushed  the ashes of some four
million people. And that was not done by gas. It was done by arrogance.It
was done by dogma. It was done by ignorance. When people believe that they
have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how we behave.
This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods.
 "Science is a very human form of knowledge. We are always at the brink of
the known, we always feel foreward for what is to be hoped.Every judgementg
in science stands on the edge of error, and is personal.Science is a tribute
to what we can know  although we are fallible...
 "I owe it as a scientist to my friend Leo Szilard, I owe it as a human
being to the many members of my family who died at Auschwitz, to stand here
by the pond as a survivor and a witness. We have to cure ourselves of the
the itch for absolute  knowledge and power. We have to close the distance
betweent he push-button order and the human act. We have to touch people."

 But Bronowski (obviously) altho he talks of these things doesnt advocate
"no science or poetry after Auschwitz.  Both (and many other aspects of
human knowledge) are essential for our culture. Godels theorems and
Heisenergs's Theorem dont obviate the search for knowledge any more than
Barthes theories mean we should all abandon being authors. That is
ridiculous.It is very human to be proud of being the creator of something
unique: not arrogance, justifiable pride. We have a deep instinctual need to
cooperate, to interact, but we are also unique: each in our own way.
Bronowski argues for tolerance.

By the way...it apparently wasnt von Nuemann but he comes into a poem which
I'll send later which I wrote (based on my remebrance of learning about the
number PI )....

I should have sent this before. Warm regards, Richard.

Stephen Helmling has just come our with an interesting book on the
over-reaching dialectics and weird writing style of Fredric Jameson's new
sentences called "The Success and Failure of Fredric Jameson: Writing, The
Sublime, and the Dialectic of Critique (SUNY Press, 2001).  The books
appears in a SUNY Series on the Sublime I am general editor of it, so I
am predisposed to like its deep engagement with critical writing and the
will to leftest critical theory in an age of neo liberal oblivion.

I know there are many on this list who hate critical theory or the
academics who make it, build careers upon it and so on.  But if you do
like critical theory in the Adorno/Benjamin/Brecht and Sartre/Barthes
lineages (plural), then you would enjoy this book.  It is critical writing
at its devious and poetic best, like that of Joe Amato!

to me it seems like "it" (capitalism) is a set of
social relations containing, but not limited to:
exchange, institutionalized hierarchy, alienation,
etc. these are, of course, the hallmarks of all class
soceties, but have become "more so" under capitalism.

> 2) what's your demolition plan?

a complex question. the answering of, methinks, must
be understood as resolving no set / fixed "plans" as
such, in favor of understanding what capitalism is and
working within a contradictory framework.

i've been working with some people to come up with
what we think are the solutions (or at least the
beingings of the solutions). i'll post the url for it
in the next few days.

but in short form: elimination of these social
relations in our everyday lives, which inevitably ends
up as us eliminating them from society as a whole.
which brings us into direct conflict with the ruling
class. and so, as unpopular as it may be: class
struggle. but understanding class struggle as being
more than going on strike in the workplace, but
including the whole range of society (which i
understand, in the phraseology of the italian
autonomist marxists, as a "social factory")... since
the working class is certainly much more than people
who work in facotories, but includes unwaged (such as
homemakers, students, the unemployed, etc.) workers as
well as white and blue collar waged workers; and the
terrain of the working class (and our domination)
includes our communities as a whole, and not just the
workplace.

and: the nature of class struggle needs to assume
modes that are contradictory to capitalism. that is:
non-hierarchical, anti-exchange (mutual aid fors of
solidarity instead, when possible), multi-nodal (as
opposed to single-nodal) centralization,
pro-creativity and constructive difference, etc.

ALLISON ADELLE HEDGE COKE AND ELINOR NAUEN
"These are songs of righteous anger and utter beauty," writes Joy Harjo of
Allison Adelle Hedge Coke's work. In Dog Road Woman, Ms. Hedge Coke's debut
collection of poems, she presents an autobiographical sketch of a
contemporary mixed-blood native life. Elinor Nauen's books of poetry include
American Guys (Hanging Loose, 1997) and CARS & Other Poems (Misty Terrace
Press). "Her work is boyish girlish. Though it's not trans-gender, it's
trans-William Carlos Williams. ... In American Guys, all parts of the reader
get satisfied, even ones she didn't know she had," writes Eileen Myles.

Monday, March 26th at 8 pm
RICK SNYDER AND JERROLD SHIROMA
Rick Snyder is the editor of Cello Entry magazine. His poems have appeared
or are forthcoming in Aufgabe, Open City, Readme, Skanky Possum,
TheEastVillage and other journals. He is the author of two chapbooks,
Blueprint and Double Ear (both from 811 Books). Jerrold Shiroma is the
editor & publisher of Duration Press, which publishes a chapbook series
dedicated to contemporary poetry in translation. His own chapbooks are 2
poems (a+bend press, 2000) and untitled object (Potes & Poets, 2000).

Wednesday, March 28th at 8 pm
WILLIAM CORBETT AND SIRI HUSTVEDT
William Corbett's many books of poetry and prose include Philip Guston's
Late Work: A Memoir; Furthering My Education; and New and Selected Poems
(Zoland Books, 1999). Robert Creeley writes of William Corbett, "The skills
of this poet are so quietly and firmly established in his work that one is
apt to forget about them in either reading or hearing-which is, of course,
their mastery." Mr. Corbett is also an editor of the magazine Pressed Wafer.
Siri Hustvedt is the author of a book of poems, Reading to You, two novels,
The Blindfold (1992) and The Enchantment of Lily Dahl (1996), as well as a
book of essays, Yonder. Her work has been translated into fifteen languages.

touche - often we call "The United States of
America" "America" - you rarely hear americans
use the term "North America" - canadians, often
so
- i am reminded of Allen Ginsberg's "America"

i've often considered Canada and Australia as
very similar countries - both dealing with
post-colonial realities - "wilderness"
stereotypes (just as a sidenote - Crocodile
Dundee 3 is coming soon to a theater near you - i
smell an Oscar) and abhorrent records as it comes
to its treatments of natives

interesting that the two most influential media
thinkers - Marshall McLuhan and Moses Znaimer (if
not a thinker - then perhaps a pro(f)phe(i)t)
are Canadian - as well as the Canadian content
rules that have perhaps acted as a hedge -
somewhat

so - the big question - what does this all have
to do with poetry, anyway?

In a recent post, Michael Amberwind said:

"i've always considered the canadian vehemence
against being considered or
compared to americans just a touch too hysterical
to be mere patriotism - "

Maybe the fact that ninety per cent of Candians
live within one hundred
miles of the most powerful civilisation in the
history of the world has
some thing to do with it -- gigawatts of radio
and televison blaring over
the border, unstoppable.

We Australians sometimes bemoan the fact that
we're twelve thousand miles
from anywhere, but that does have its advantages.

if there is a theme it is the way language
redeems solicitude in the face of
its attendant and necessary dissolution
which is already the dissolution

of the pronoun its hideous linkages
and the repetition which aspires to music
which changes the brain
its very structure that is to say

across the Copernican revolution
things before things in the mind and
without but if there is a theme

it is already after the fact and redeemed
against the hell of persistence, the conjunction
and accumulation which is otherwise

history and world. well, language gets me
up in the morning because beauty redeems
shit in something else like neon

which always appears to float and which
disperses or repudiates solicitude in
immense social project, waves without end.

A friend of mine is looking for a space in NYC to be able to locate a
baby-grand piano.
If anybody, preferably in Manhattan or Brooklyn, has any extra space
and would be willing to let somebody store (and occasionally come and play)
a piano there, could you please backchannel me---
Of course, we'd let you play the piano too, maybe offer some money
or at least lessons....

Thanks, Chris Stroffolino

It is with great sadness and utter shock that I pass on this note just in=
 from Gary Sullivan. I am sending out as a separate post a letter from his=
 sister to our list, which Gary also forwarded to me.

I corresponded by email with Ramez and had some lively discussions with him=
 at readings, as well as avidly reading his reviews and essays. (A quick=
 search on Google.com came up with a number of his pieces.)

This is the place to quote a poem, to console or maybe add some perspective.=

Subject: Ramez Qureshi, 1972-2001

Hello everyone,

I have some very sad news to report. Ramez Qureshi, who many of you will=
 know from this list as well as from his critical writing and poetry on=
 various online & in print magazines, passed away last Saturday night,=
 apparently by his own hand, although the details at this time are still not=
 entirely clear. He was 28.

I first "met" Ramez online, in response to a call in 1999 I put on the list=
 for the first issue of Readme. He wrote asking if I'd be interested in a=
 review of J.H. Prynne's Poems. I was thrilled that someone wanted to write=
 about Prynne, and was curious about who Ramez was: Who would brave a review=
 of Prynne's Poems? So, I begged him to send it, which he did. It was a=
 brilliant review, obviously the product of careful reading and a real love=
 of the work. I was amazed that I was going to get to publish it. Ramez=
 continued to send me reviews, essays and poetry (he wrote on Armand=
 Schwerner, Stuart Merrill, Mark Rothko), and I began to see his work=
 popping up in some of my favorite online and in print journals: How2,=
 Lagniappe, Jacket, Rain Taxi, Riding the Meridian, Cauldron & Net, Lynx:=
 Poetry from Bath, where he wrote about Barbara Guest, Johanna Drucker, John=
 Cage, Tom Raworth, Nick Piombino, Michel Foucault ... as well as, less=
 frequently, publishing his own poetry. It was clear that he lived for=
 poetry -- for writing in general -- was a voracious, careful, loving and=
 diverse reader, and though he kept most of it to himself, a prolific and=
 engaging poet. (His uncle Rafique Kathwari, a poet himself, said that=
 despite the fact that he and Ramez talked often about poetry and writing,=
 Ramez never showed him any of his poetry.)

In a post of his from November of 1999, Ramez said: "Marjorie Perloff was=
 wrong. I 'need' poetry." I don't think I've personally met anyone for whom=
 this was more true.

I didn't know at first that Ramez lived in the New York area ... not until I=
 got an email message from him asking for directions to a reading. I was=
 shocked to find out that he'd never been to the Poetry Project before,=
 especially when he told me that he had spent most of his life in=
 Westchester County, just north of the city. Soon, Ramez began coming to=
 more events, and on occasion Nada & I would get a call from him, and we'd=
 either hang out before and or after this or that event. When we heard that=
 certain poets would be reading soon, we began to assume that Ramez would be=
 calling, or that we might see him at the reading.

Once, Nada and I had dinner with Ramez and his sister Sofie, who was about=
 to move from New York City to San Francisco to study environmental science.=
 I think at that time, Ramez had gotten into Otis College of Art and Design=
 in Los Angeles, and was very excited by the prospect of getting to study=
 with Douglas Messerli and (I think) Leslie Scalapino. But, days before he=
 was set to move, he decided against it. I later asked him why, but he said=
 that he had just decided to stay in New York and study computer=
 programming. I was taken aback by this, and began to slowly realize that=
 leaving and being away from home must have meant much more for him than=
 most. I knew that Ramez had suffered from chronic depression, and once when=
 he was supposed to meet up with me & Nada to see Clark Coolidge & Michael =
 Gizzi read he didn't show up, and called later from a hospital, saying that=
 he had "gotten sick." But I didn't know the whole story until talking with=
 Sofie and Ramez's friends & other family after the prayers and burial this=
 Tuesday. I'm beginning to realize now just how much poetry meant to Ramez,=
 and how much his fairly recent entry into the world of letters, his=
 acceptance by the various magazines that he read and returned to, meant to=
 him. I realized that it meant a lot to his friends and family, too.

Sofie has asked me to forward a letter she has written to the everyone here=
 about just that. She's also asking for help in locating all of Ramez's work=
 in publication. If you published anything of Ramez Qureshi's, or if you=
 corresponded with him, please get in touch with her.

Ramez was not only one of the most brilliant people I've ever met (I felt=
 like the laziest reader in the world hanging out with him, he could quote=
 from so much), he  was also the sweetest. He will be greatly missed.

Dear Poetics Listserve,

You don't know me but I know you. About three years ago you became a vital=
 part of my brother's life. Since then Ramez not only read and contributed=
 to the listserve but through it was exposed to a whole new social world of=
 (un)like minded artists, both online and in New York City. He began going=
 to more readings, meeting other poets and getting his work exposed. In his=
 excitement, he would forward me your poetry and other postings, especially=
 those of Alan Sondheim, which, quite frankly, I didn't 'understand.'=
 However what my family and I did understand is that the listserve brought=
 meaning and community into Ramez's life. Struggling with 'mental illness'=
 (diagnosed as bipolar) for the past eight years, Ramez led a more solitary=
 life than most. There aren't many spaces in society for people surviving=
 with 'mental illness,' which in turn fostered my  brother's alienation. And=
 so these days while most folks seem to want to escape from community, my=
 brother needed this space to escape to community. And although we could=
 never keep the pace of his passions, the listserve and its repercussions=
 gave us a way to share in his life, which in the internality of his=
 hallucinations, depressions, manias, paranoia and brilliance was often=
 elusive.

Inevitably conversations with my brother would turn to politics, me being=
 the supposed 'concrete  activist' and him the 'academic leftist.' In these=
 conversations he used to question the role of poetry. Not knowing too much=
 about poetry(ies), I would say things like "The role of poetry is to utter=
 the un-utterable; to open up spaces of consciousness and resistance; to=
 language oppressions; to re-language histories and spaces of resistance; to=
 shift contexts; to create community; to rethink grammars of action. And of=
 course to inspire." Perhaps. But in his death  I realized the obvious; my=
 brother's passion for poetry: reading, writing, theorizing, discovering and=
 most importantly relating with others who shared these passions, in=
 whatever virtual manner, kept him alive for the past eight years. Quite=
 literally and with no exaggeration.

So I want to thank you for creating community and keeping poetry and my=
 brother, Ramez, alive.

With tremendous gratitude,

Sofia M. Qureshi

p.s. I am in the process of collecting his online and print work (poetry and=
 reviews) and would appreciate any leads. Please write to me at:=

Hello Everyone,

I have some very sad news to report. Ramez Qureshi, who many of you
will know from this list as well as from his critical writing and
poetry on various online & in print magazines, passed away last
Saturday night, apparently by his own hand, although the details at
this time are still not entirely clear. He was 28.

I first "met" Ramez online, in response to a call in 1999 I put on the
list for the first issue of Readme. He wrote asking if I'd be
interested in a review of J.H. Prynne's Poems. I was thrilled that
someone wanted to write about Prynne, and was curious about who Ramez
was: Who would brave a review of Prynne's Poems? So, I begged him to
send it, which he did. It was a brilliant review, obviously the
product of careful reading and a real love of the work. I was amazed
that I was going to get to publish it. Ramez continued to send me
reviews, essays and poetry (he wrote on Armand Schwerner, Stuart
Merrill, Mark Rothko), and I began to see his work popping up in some
of my favorite online and in print journals: How2, Lagniappe, Jacket,
Rain Taxi, Riding the Meridian, Cauldron & Net, Lynx: Poetry from
Bath, where he wrote about Barbara Guest, Johanna Drucker, John Cage,
Tom Raworth, Nick Piombino, Michel Foucault ... as well as, less
frequently, publishing his own poetry. It was clear that he lived for
poetry -- for writing in general -- was a voracious, careful, loving
and diverse reader, and though he kept most of it to himself, a
prolific and engaging poet. (His uncle Rafique Kathwari, a poet
himself, said that despite the fact that he and Ramez talked often
about poetry and writing, Ramez never showed him any of his poetry.)

In a post of his from November of 1999, Ramez said: "Marjorie Perloff
was wrong. I 'need' poetry." I don't think I've personally met anyone
for whom this was more true.

I didn't know at first that Ramez lived in the New York area ... not
until I got an email message from him asking for directions to a
reading. I was shocked to find out that he'd never been to the Poetry
Project before, especially when he told me that he had spent most of
his life in Westchester County, just north of the city. Soon, Ramez
began coming to more events, and on occasion Nada & I would get a call
from him, and we'd either hang out before and or after this or  that
event. When we heard that certain poets would be reading soon, we
began to assume that Ramez would be calling, or that we might see him
at the reading.

Once, Nada and I had dinner with Ramez and his sister Sofie, who was
about to move from New York City to San Francisco to study
environmental science. I think at that time, Ramez had gotten into
Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, and was very excited by
the prospect of getting to study with Douglas Messerli and (I think)
Leslie Scalapino. But, days before he was set to move, he decided
against it. I later asked him why, but he said that he had just
decided to stay in New York and study computer programming. I was
taken aback by this, and began to slowly realize that leaving and
being away from home must have meant much more for him than most. I
knew that Ramez had suffered from chronic depression, and once when he
was supposed to meet up with me & Nada to see Clark Coolidge & Michael
Gizzi read he didn't show up, and called later from a hospital, saying
that he had "gotten sick." But I didn't know the whole story until
talking with Sofie and Ramez's friends & other family after the
prayers and burial this Tuesday. I'm beginning to realize now just how
much poetry meant to Ramez, and how much his fairly recent entry into
the world of letters, his acceptance by the various magazines that he
read and returned to, meant to him. I realized that it meant a lot to
his friends and family, too.

Sofie has asked me to forward a letter she has written to the everyone
here about just that. She's also asking for help in locating all of
Ramez's work in publication. If you published anything of Ramez
Qureshi's, or if you corresponded with him, please get in touch with
her.

Ramez was not only one of the most brilliant people I've ever met (I
felt like the laziest reader in the world hanging out with him, he
could quote from so much), he  was also the sweetest. He will be
greatly missed.

All of the single letters were reserved from the initial pool of domain names.
Second level domains and even third level under the letters are not for sale,
either (I was trying to buy "e" but thought I would settle for "i").  They
claimed (three years ago already?) that while they had initially intended to
release the letters, they could no longer think of an equitable way to put them
up for sale or hold a lottery.

I know there is a recording (LP) of Reynolds' Emperor of Ice Cream, as I
played it on my college radio show ages ago. I don't remember who recorded
it, but you might find useful info at http://www.rogerreynolds.com/

Is it just me, or does all this concern about awards seem really bogus =
and offensive?  Putting books in competition with each other helps no =
one except those interested in maintaining old hierarchies or =
establishing new ones.  And the same goes for all that stamp nonsense.

Just want to say that I will miss hearing from Loopy, the Jubeem from Outer
Space.  What a brilliant individual and what a painful loss.  Being young
and bipolar can be a beautiful thing, but it has its horrors as well.  O
that is the understatement of a divided life!  I did not know him well, but
I knew him a little, and feel a loss all the same.  As I am sure we all do.

Ramez is at peace.  For those of who are fortunate enough to count
yourselves among his friends and family, I offer you my deepest heartfelt
condolences.   Your peace will be much harder to find than his, but you will
surely find it.


From a living bipolar to one who has passed:

under oxygen cloak this bud must burn to bloom
the fire, this suffering, such smoke does consume
tropic bend of a vine, a youth's short sweet time
goodbye loopy thank you kindly for such divine

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

A little promotional posting here--I hadn't seen the book mentioned yet on
the list.  Keith Tuma's _Anthology of Twentieth-Century British and Irish
Poetry_ from Oxford UP is finally out; it is obtainable from bookstores or
Amazon.com.  The matter-of-fact title disguises the book's originality &
importance: it's a scrupulous rethinking of the last century's poetry,
ignoring the received histories of British & Irish poetry in order to
document, alongside "mainstream" poetries, a large & mostly little
celebrated range of modernist poetries.  It stretches from Thomas Hardy & GM
Hopkins to Caroline Bergvall & Helen Macdonald; you'll find unexpected
juxtapositions like Bob Cobbing (b.1920) next to Philip Larkin (1922-1985)
and Keith Douglas (1920-1944), or Tom Raworth (b.1938) near Seamus Heaney
(b.1939), or Maggie O'Sullivan (b.1951) and John Wilkinson (b.1953) next to
Paul Muldoon (b.1951).  It's a genuinely pluralist book, though the kinds of
modernist poetry that interest this list's members get an especially large
helping. -- The other distinctive feature of the book is the presence of
detailed annotations; they are written by myself, with the assistance of
many generous scholars &, in the case of the living, the poets themselves.
Doing them was a pretty rewarding & invaluable experience--one memory
particularly emblazoned on my brain is a 3-hour transatlantic phonecall from
Barry MacSweeney to unpick the draft notes I'd sent him, a year before he
died....rest in peace, Barry.

Anyway, even hardened scholars in the field will find the book packs a lot
of surprises; & the general reader will discover a whole field of poetry
often little-read in North America.  If you thought you had a handle on this
century's poetry in English Keith's book will prove an invigorating
corrective. -- The book's blurb, cover & table of contents may be found at
www.oup-usa.com -- type "Keith Tuma" in the search engine & it'll pop up.

OK: ad break over. -- all best --N

I've found Bookfinder to be quite useful:

www.bookfinder.com

Their search engine goes through a wide variety of databases (ABE, Alibris,
Justbooks, Powell's, Antiqbook, the big ones)  and the people I've dealt
with through them have been reliable and accommodating.

I may have missed an earlier part of this conversation, and my question may
not be quit appropos to this list, but, seeing everyone else included here,
why not ginsberg (i'm pretty sure he hasn't had a stamp already.)?
kerouac's here but not ginsberg.

The Crayfish

Ponge, Lautreamont, Micheaux, among others. The crayfish is an extraordin-
ary creature, numerous appendages and legs moving in a flawless subsump-
tion architecture, surely guided by a hierarchy of goals and motivations.
Thus the lesser aid the greater; the lower, the higher; the followers, the
avant-garde. What goes before all, those enormous claws raised on occasion
with the intent warning or other display, at times flailing half-heartedly
in the water, a form of seduction, a lure. It eats peas. It crawls in the
middle of the night to the top of the rock to wave those claws. It preys
to gods as numerous as its feet. Its body flutters constantly - then
stills - then sways to inner music. It is bright read. A small sharkfish
has become friends, or at least entered into an agreement; both inhabit,
at times simultaneously, the same overturned cup, without danger. So far,
there are no broken bones or carapaces. The crayfish is an uncanny animal.
It is imaginary. It resides on the edges of others' dreams. This enables
its survival. One can assume, as I do, that it is constantly underfoot. It
is fashioned from the chthonic. It is the opposite of the abject; it
preens. It is often irritable and I desire, more than anything else, to
give it pleasure. In such a fashion it will exist quietly, no longer an
emanant of nightmares, a harbinger of deja-vu, ill-will, remonstrance. It
is clear that I will exit before it will, that my carapace, of my making,
is fit for rendering, but not for inhabitation. The crayfish by proxy is
the most intense creature in this world, unknowingly gathering the thought
and desires of everything around it. It rests on the tips of its feet, and
proceeds through the murk on errands of enunciation, announced only by
environment, not by presence. In its inability to speak, lies, for us, a
refusal of the deepest sort. We read upon the carapace such delicacy in so
many limbs and extensions. It watches out of desire and fear; prey
emerges, emergent.

Orpheus. I'm trying. I agree with you...there arent enough discussions.
People are scared to appear naive or make an "incorrect" statement so they
all hide behind announcements and cryptic comments. An example is Ron
Silliman who is obsessed with who won what award. Who cares? Lets get on
with the dialogue and some poems. Alan Sondheim puts on a lot of stuff.
Patrick Herron is always interesting...but it seems there are too many
announcements (or too many by proportion). Sure, they are neccessary.
Another thing is that the same old names keep cropping up. I'm a good
reader, and would enjoy say three months in the U.S. If someone could
finance it: I could do a poetical reading tour of that fascinating country.
The object being my own happiness. I wont be known except as the New Zealand
Poet etc and I wont have won this or that award or be in any academic
situation. I do have a book...but the main thing will be my surprise value.
People will come along and..well my readings will be "conceptual"...while
I'm away boozing or swimming or whatever people may come to hear what (their
interpretaion entirely) could have been my poetry. The tour would be
immensely to my advantage as I would be paid (in addition to expenses)
US250,000 for each non appearance....
   Any way, silly buggers aside, its now your move.After all, you: have
lyre, will sing, no?  Send! Dispute! Controverse!    Richard.

as there has been so much warmth in the making of labour's history it is
strange that there has been so little in the writing of it. As a rule, it
has been written by dry-as-dust economists who treat it as if it were the
record of the advance of an economic doctrine. As well write the history of
the religious movement as if it were the record of the advance of
theological doctrine. Labour doctrines have never advanced except as they
have been lived and loved by individuals.

Time Mechanix 11: PAUL CELAN
presented by Rob Manery
Tuesday April 3, 8pm
at Robson Central (750 Burrard)
Vancouver BC
FREE

PAUL CELAN (1920-1970) has been called one of the most influential European
poets of the twentieth century. He was born in Bukovina in a Jewish
community where he learned Hebrew, German, and Romanian. After the Second
World War (in which both his parents died in death camps), Celan settled in
Paris where he lived until his death in 1970. In 1952 his book, Mohn und
Ged=E4chtnis, was published in West Germany to immediate acclaim. His other
books include Von Schwelle zu Schwelle (1955), Sprachgitter (1959), Die
Niemandsrose (1963), Atemwende (1967), Fadensonne (1968); and three
post-humous volumes: Lichtzwang(1970), Schneepart (1971), and Zeitgeh=F6ft
(1976).  He was also a translator of Rimbaud, Valery, Appolinaire, Michaux,
Char, Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, Blok and Mandelstam
among others.

ROB MANERY, with Louis Cabri, is the publisher of hole books.

David, thanks, I'll look for that. Chambers is a figure of fun for
people like me precisely *because* he is much more than a pumpkin joke.
Chambers, of course, fingered Alger Hiss and opened the door for Joseph
McCarthy and his list of 205 "card-carrying members of the Communist
Party." Whether he was a fan of McCarthy's or not, he had everything to
do with creating the atmosphere that made McCarthy possible. As a direct
result, my father lost his job in the first integrated radio station in
Washington D.C. (which went off the air) and never worked in radio
again. While my father sold lawn chairs, Whittaker Chambers was making
30K a year (back when that meant something!) as senior editor at Henry
Luce's Time and later William F. Buckley's National Review. So you'll
forgive me if I laugh when Ronald Reagan awards Chambers a posthumous
Medal of Freedom and designates the Chambers pumpkin patch a national
historic landmark. I really can't help it.

There have been too many useless deaths, too many people I've been close
to or engaged with - Michael Current, Michael Spirito, Alexander Chislen-
ko, Ramez - who I didn't know well, but always admired. We would talk at
various readings, and the talk was good. I felt close to him and distanced
at the same time. There have been too many deaths, too many subtle
absences online and off. And too many useless deaths; I still think of
Kathy Acker: how unbearably frail we are, especially in these dark times.

In a recent post, Michael Amberwind said:

"i've always considered the canadian vehemence
against being considered or
compared to americans just a touch too hysterical
to be mere patriotism - "

I've got to say I'm with Michael on this one.  As a Manitoban
transplanted to the States, I hear the Great White Vehemence every time
I go back to the old country.

I remember, too, my Social Studies teacher in (Canadian) high school
saying that "patriotism is what we have, and jingoism is what they
have."  At first I thought the was being clever and ironic  -- that he
was saying that whoever "we" are, our biases are okay, but whoever
"they" are, their biases are ignorant and vicious.   Talked to him
later, found out I was way off base.  "We" are the Canucks, "they" are
the Yankee imperialist running dogs.

As John Tranter points out, this sort of resentment/insecurity is
understandable, given the geo-politics  of it all.  But there are plenty
of things we can understand without being proud of them.

Michael asks what all this has to do with poetry.  Well: browse around
any book of poems by, say, Robert Kroetsh or Margaret Atwood.  National
identity anxiety informs the work, at the thematic level but also, I
think, in terms of form.  (I babbled on about this at Assembling
Alternatives in New Hampshire a few years ago...)

****** Friends:  I'm sending out notice for this special event--two nights
this week--to benefit San Francisco Cinematheque.  Trinh T. Minh-ha last
Spring read from her written work in an event co-sponsored by The Poetry
Center and SF Cinematheque.  Here's a rare opportunity to view her new film
here in town, and to benefit this truly unique arts organization.  ******

 March 23rd and 24th at 8 pm:
 San Francisco Cinematheque Presents:
 The U.S. Premiere of Trinh T. Minh-ha's

    The Fourth Dimension

Co-Presented with the Consulate General of Japan in San Francisco

Trinh T. Minh-ha In Person

  "Surface is surface, and yet boundless is the depth of the surface that
neither conceals nor reveals." This line from Trinh Minh-ha's new lyrical
digital essay could easily speak to the work itself, for it is through its
exploration of the visual and aural surfaces of 'rituals' of daily life and
art in Japan that The Fourth Dimension (produced by Jean-Paul Bourdier)
engages us with its myriad reflections on the "craft of framing time."
Composed with striking visual compositions and juxtapositions and a
stunning soundtrack (music by The Construction of Ruins with Greg Goodman
and Shoko Hikage), Trinh Minh-ha's first digital work expands on some of
the formal and philosophical concerns of her earlier films and focuses on
"time as explored and experienced in video imaging." Public festivals,
religious rites, theatrical performances are surfaces to be explored, but
so are the small gestures and ordinary acts of living, of moving through
space, of resting in time. As we watch and listen to this provocative and
meditative piece, we, too, become "attentive to the infraordinary. An
intrusion of eternity."

 Tickets for this event are still available!
 Tickets are $15, $10 discount, to benefit Cinematheque.

 This program takes place at the San Francisco Art Institute, located at
800 Chestnut Street, corner of Jones, two blocks up the hill from Columbus
Street.

When Chambers was back at Columbia in the early 20s, along with Meyer
Schapiro, Louis Zukofsky, Clifton Fadiman, Lionel Trilling and other folks who
later became famous, he was considered the most talented writer of the lot,
both in poetry & prose.  *Witness*--aside from its status as bible to the
anti-communist hard right--is a beautifully-written book, probably one of the
great American autobiographies.  Sam Tanenhaus's recent biography of Chambers
is extremely smart & compulsively readable, and demonstrates just what a
weird, divided character Chambers was.

I guess we haven't seen these in a while. Keep in mind that
the usual caveat applies: the listserv program skews the
tally by attributing to the U.S. any address that lacks
a country code. I've tried, but can't seem to unselect
"imperialism" in the preferences file.

I've been browsing around in Tuma's anthology, and want to second Nate
Dorward's endorsement of the book.  It is as original and important as
Nate says it is.

It is also sure to be savaged by British reviewers, though: the "only
Americans like this sort of experimental poetry" card is certainly going
to be played.  Look for thinly veiled ad-hominum attacks on Tuma the
Marauding Yank in a TLS near you!

The book will be reviewed by Catherine Kasper in Samizdat #8 this
summer.

I actually tried to nominate Ginsberg (as well as Corso and Gwendolyn
Brooks), but the nomination was not approved. Apparently, a poet needs
to be dead 10 years before s/he can be on a stamp!

It's a year within a few hours since Alaric Sumner died.

The pages about him at http://www.crosswinds.net/~subvoicivepoetry/ are
about to be updated with a detailed bibliography and information on
posthumous publications, information on the availability of wordsworth
magazine and publications, and on his own publications. The updating should
be done by Easter

In the meantime feel free to enquire by emailing me b-c and I will do my
best to answer and as quickly as possible

LETTERS FOR DEAR AUGUSTINE, one of the projects he was working on at the
time of his death, will be in print for the first time soon

Apologies for cross-posting or unwanted receipt of this notice which is
being sent out generally. There is an email list for those who want specific
information about Alaric's work. B-c if you want to be added

Just because Ron Silliman passes on announcements
of poetry contest winners does not make him obsessed
with them--even though he usually says something
sardonic about them.  I for one find the announcements
interesting, albeit just about always annoying.  The
contests themselves are stupid but important because
they reflect who gets published, and where; and whose
poetry gets discussed, and where.  Both of those things
ought to be of concern to any non-solipsistic poet.
To anyone interested in poetry, in fact.

Same with the practice of publishing some poets and
not publishing others.  (Moral: competition is
inevitable, so try to make it more effective
and intelligent rather than condemn it.)

The Aviatrix Reading Series is now accepting submissions from writers who
would like to appear as featured readers in our monthly Brooklyn reading.  We
are an intimate, listening space.  No one will be ordering lattes, shooting
pool, or chatting up the bar tender while you read.  While we are, for the
most part, focused on the words on the page rather than on performance, we
have had wonderful experiences with performance poets, slammers, and
musicians.  We are open to most anything.  Please send three poems, or one
short story to Jodylbk@aol.com with the subject line "Aviatrix."  We look
forward to hearing from you, and reading your work.

Good question Ken!

I think that Canada and Australia have things in common, but our climates
and terrain are different, our ethnic mixes are different, our cultures are
different.

And the US has its own 'post-colonial realities', I suspect. We are speaking
English for a reason.

XEROLAGE 30 is now available from Xexoxial Editions,
10375 Cty Hway A, LaFarge WI 54639 for $4.50.
Check with Miekal And to find out postage, if
any: dtv@mwt.net.  It has 26 visual poems by me
plus a bio and author's commentary.  XEROLAGE has
been going since 1985, thanks to editors Miekal
And and Lyx Ish.  Each issue is devoted to
one poet's, or poetry-team's, Xerox-related
ouevre.  I have always considered it, and SCORE
and KALDRON, the most important visual poetry
publications in the US over the past ten or twenty
years.  I'm really pleased to be in it--and also, for
the first time, to have a *selected visual poetry of*
in print.

The three previous issues of XEROLAGE were
devoted to Jean-Francois Robic, Carlyle Baker
and Carla Bertola--they're available, too.  Not
sure whether they're new or not.  I just got my
copies of them, so they're new to me.
Terrific stuff for those into this kind
of material.

Headington Hill off Headington Road, Oxford:
Joan Retallack from the U.S., Jacques Darras from France, and Anthony
Joseph from the U.K. will be reading/performing their work, followed by the
debut of American poet Carla Harryman's new theatre piece _Performing
Objects Stationed / In / Platform on the Suburban World_. Tickets are 6

Well, it's pretty much degenerated into a farce at this point -- Langston
Hughes leads all other poets by a margin of greater than 3 to 1. How much of
this is because Rod McKuen is still alive and therefore not eligible we'll
never know.

some parmenides


some boys come out of the right side of the womb and some girls out of the
left. their limbs wander. somewhere the mind's in the mix. whatever
thinks, is the mix. whatever the mix is, it thinks. some boys and some
girls are rooted in water. whatever the earth is, moonlight looks to sun.
there's a problem if the seeds don't mix. then the mind's not there, seeds
clash, everything doubles. when they double there are some boys and some
girls. then when they mix, they think of fighting. their limbs wander and
they come out [looking at] the moon. then they are the moon. then they
look to sun. then they go back in.

the moon doesn't belong here. take away the light. the moon is foreign. i
can't see myself in the moon. look at it there. it's somewhere else. it's
uncomfortable here. it doesn't mix.

thinking is mixing. mixing is being and from being come all things. they
remain there because of the mixing. there are no things without being.
things, welcome being! being, the mother of all things. things, behold
being! [your things] are being things.

turning back when things are and are not, mix left and right. there are no
things and no turning back. there are no things that are not and are, mix
right and left. in the center there is no center.

if it is coming together, it is serrated edges. if it is scattering, it is
loosening. if it is gathering, it is fleeing. if it is fleeing, it is
mixing. if it is gripping it is holding, if it is holding it is releasing.
if it is carrying it is moving, if it is carrying, it is speaking.

what is not, is not for you to know. what is not, within the mix, is for
you to know in the mix. what is not, is an empty path. to mix the path, to
find out from the mirror what is to know. what is to know is not to be
known, is useless to be known, is not knowing. knowing is knowing what is
not, knowing is that empty paths are most traveled.

when you ride the chariot, the axles heat, the axles turn red-hot, they
are heated by the sun within them, the day before them, the night behind.
when the axles turn red-hot, the doors open on their copper jambs, the
hinges are well-turned, the doors turn on their hinges, the grooves in the
road are set, the chariot wheels forward within them, the chariot moves
ahead, i am greeted by night and day, moon and sun, sea and ocean, earth
and island. for what one is within the other, the other is within the one.

there are some boys and some girls on the left and right of the chariot.
where the chariot wanders, within the body the womb also wanders. there
are some boys and some girls on the right and left of the axle. do not
feed them, they are turning the axle. they move the chariot forward. the
chariot creaks forward, the axles turn, red-hot, do not touch the axle.
the chariot shudders and moves by grooves set in the road of stone by
generations. it moves between the lintels of the doors, between the posts
of the doors. it moves slightly to the left and slightly to the right. it
moves between the doors and enters.

[everything is called 'night and day,' everything is filled with 'night
and day,' night is thinking, day has its share of emptiness, everything is
called 'everything.']

Dear Friends, Family & Supporters.

Tomorrow, Friday, March 23rd Indian groups will hold a press
conference/demonstration at The State Capitol Complex In Charleston, WV.

It will begin at 11:30 am.

The purpose will be to expose Walmart's deceitful actions in attempting
to
obtain a sacred burial site near Morgantown, WV to build yet another
SuperCenter. There is already a Walmart in Morgantown.
In their greediness they want to cripple the economic structure of the
area
and make the community dependent on them as they have elsewhere.

We will demand that State Officials deny Walmart the needed State
Highway
access to the burial site  which they need to proceed.
We will insist  The WV Attorney General investigate why state laws
which prohibit the looting of graves sites are not being enforced at
this
site.

The people of West Virginia and the Indigenous of this land need your
help.
Please help us by attending the demonstration in Charleston. If you
cannot
attend please deluge The State Government of West Virginia  with phone
calls
and emails and demand Walmart be stopped from defiling yet another
burial
site.

Here here! Its ridiculous if they're all serious. They have to be clowning
around. If so, ok, but if they are serious about who wins what award or
whether Jack John or Jill are on a stamp then may the Force preserve us!

i really do not know - i have not spoken to each
and every Native American - tho i am just
starting to read "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee"
and if the last two thirds are anything like the
first - i suspect they feel in psychological
terms could be called "pretty damned pissed"

just as every time a Taker culture comes in
contact w/ a Leaver culture (to use Daniel
Quinn's terms) - someone gets rich and someone
gets fucked

Tribal life - for all of its "flaws" (ie - ways i
might look at and say "I would not want to live
like that") - actually does WORK - they are
stable survival strategies

i question whether our - by that i mean Leaver,
or non-tribal strategies, not just western
culture - is going to last another hundred years
- the conceivable span of the rest of my life

so what does this mean for poetry?

good question...

if poets are "cultural antennae" - and i have
reservations about the notion - then what is the
responsibility of the poet to speak the truth -
and maintain the art - that notion much dreaded
by some - in our sideways driven, postmodern
irony-of the-hip world - "vision"? (all old
questions, i know, but old questions are the best
ones)

can i really read Whitman the same again - with
what can often be seen as a wholesale acceptance
of manifest destiny? and how much of what has
followed Whitman has been the "Whitman project"?

a great deal - i would say - clearly the value i
derive from Whitman is not that of political
philosopher

i'm not a historian - or philosopher or
anthropologist or sociologist - having long ago
realised i could be mediocre in those fields or
an adequate poet - and i think over much is made
(and over much is made of over much being made
of) of historical and cultural influences

and yet... and yet...

PIERRE JORIS AND NICOLE PEYRAFITTE:

Multi-Literary Event at the Flying Saucer Cafe!


Alan, Nada, and Azure are pleased to announce another event in a new
reading/video/film/performance series in Brooklyn at The Flying Saucer
Cafe at 494 Atlantic Avenue, between Third Avenue and Nevins, Brooklyn

Tuesday, April 3, 8:00 p.m.:


********PIERRE JORIS and NICOLE PEYRAFITTE***********

READING AND PERFORMANCE


PIERRE JORIS left Luxembourg at eighteen & has since lived in the US,
Great Britain, North Africa & France. In 1992 he returned to the Mid-
Hudson valley & teaches poetry & theory at SUNY-Albany. He has published
numerous books of poetry, as well as several anthologies (most recently
_Poems for the Millennium, vol 1 & 2: A University of California Book of
Modern & Postmodern Poetry, with Jerome Rothenberg.) His translations
include books by Paul Celan, Maurice Blanchot, Edmond Jabes, Habib
Tengour, Tchicaya U'Tamsi, Kurt Schwitters and many others. Rothenberg &
Joris are presently translating the writings of Pablo Picasso for Exact
Change in Boston. In 1999 Joris published the manifessay _Towards a
Nomadic Poetics_ (Spanner Editions, Hereford), and _h.j.r._ (poems,
EarthWind Press, Ann Arbor.) In 2000 sun&moon brought out his translation
of Paul Celan's _Threadsuns_, while Wesleyan University Press published
his _Poasis: Selected Poems 1986-1999_ in March of this year.

The current issue of Samizdat (#7) is a special issue on Joris' & Jerome
Rothenberg's work.

              Born (1960) & raised in Luchon, French Pyrenees,
     NICOLE PEYRAFITTE left her hometown in 1981 where she was a cook.
      Lived in Toulouse & Paris where she modeled, cooked, worked for
                       theater and local television.
                   Arrived in the United States in 1987.
   First she settled in Southern California and moved to Albany New York
                         in 1992 where she still is.
          Like the willful child in Marguerite Duras' Les Enfants,
    she resisted going to school, "because they were trying to teach her
                       things that she didn't know."
     Each step of her work attempts to fulfill her compulsion to learn
                       through a process of immersion
         to generate paintings/drawings/ collages/writing/computer
                   animation/voice works & performances.

For more info, check out: http://nicolepeyrafitte.com


How to get there: Take the 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or D or Q to the Atlantic
Subway stop and walk underground to the Pacific Street exit (at the N or R
or M Pacific Street Stop) or take the B or N or R or M - in any case, go
out the Pacific Street Exit (right exit), take a right - at the end of the
block you will be on Atlantic Ave. Take a left on Atlantic, and about two
and a half blocks down, between Third and Nevins, you will find the Flying
Saucer Cafe.

Geraldo, Eat Your Avant-Pop Heart Out  By Mark
Leyner

HOBOKEN, N.J. -- JENNY JONES: Boy, we have a show
for you today! Recently, the University of
Virginia philosopher Richard Rorty made the
stunning declaration that nobody has "the
foggiest idea" what postmodernism means. "It
would be nice to get rid of it," he said. "It
isn't exactly an idea; it's a word that pretends
to stand for an idea."

This shocking admission that there is no such
thing as postmodernism has produced a firestorm
of protest around the country. Thousands of
authors, critics and graduate students who'd
considered themselves postmodernists are outraged
at the betrayal.

Today we have with us a writer -- a recovering
postmodernist -- who believes that his literary
career and personal  life have been irreparably
damaged by the theory, and who feels defrauded by
the academics who promulgated it.  He wishes to
remain anonymous, so we'll call him "Alex."

Alex, as an adolescent, before you began
experimenting with postmodernism, you considered
yourself -- what?

Close shot of ALEX.

     An electronic blob obscures his face. Words
appear at bottom of screen: "Says he was
traumatized bypostmodernism and blames
academics."

     ALEX (his voice electronically altered): A
high modernist. Y'know, Pound, Eliot, Georges
Braque, Wallace Stevens, Arnold Schoenberg, Mies
van der Rohe. I had all of Schoenberg's 78's.

     JENNY JONES: And then you started reading
people like Jean-Francois Lyotard and Jean
Baudrillard -- how  did that change your feelings
about your modernist heroes?

     ALEX: I suddenly felt that they were, like,
stifling and canonical.

     JENNY JONES: Stifling and canonical? That is
so sad, such a waste. How old were you when you
first read  Fredric Jameson?

     ALEX: Nine, I think.

     The AUDIENCE gasps.

     JENNY JONES: We have some pictures of young
Alex....

     We see snapshots of 14-year-old ALEX reading
Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's
"Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia." The
AUDIENCE oohs and ahs.

     ALEX: We used to go to a friend's house
after school -- y'know, his parents were never
home -- and we'd read, like, Paul Virilio and
Julia Kristeva.

     JENNY JONES: So you're only 14, and you're
already skeptical toward the "grand narratives"
of modernity,  you're questioning any belief
system that claims universality or transcendence.
Why?

     ALEX: I guess -- to be cool.

     JENNY JONES: So, peer pressure?
     ALEX: I guess.

     JENNY JONES: And do you remember how you
felt the very first time you entertained the
notion that you and  your universe are
constituted by language -- that reality is a
cultural construct, a "text" whose meaning is
determined by infinite associations with other
"texts"?

     ALEX: Uh, it felt, like, good. I wanted to
do it again.

     The AUDIENCE groans.

     JENNY JONES: You were arrested at about this
time?

     ALEX: For spray-painting "The Hermeneutics
of Indeterminacy" on an overpass.

     JENNY JONES: You're the child of a mixed
marriage -- is that right?

     ALEX: My father was a de Stijl
Wittgensteinian and my mom was a
neo-pre-Raphaelite.

     JENNY JONES: Do you think that growing up in
a mixed marriage made you more vulnerable to the
siren song of postmodernism?

     ALEX: Absolutely. It's hard when you're a
little kid not to be able to just come right out
and say (sniffles),  y'know, I'm an Imagist or
I'm a phenomenologist or I'm a post-painterly
abstractionist. It's really hard - especially
around the holidays. (He cries.)

     JENNY JONES: I hear you. Was your wife a
postmodernist?

     ALEX: Yes. She was raised avant-pop, which
is a fundamentalist offshoot of postmodernism.

     JENNY JONES: How did she react to Rorty's
admission that postmodernism was essentially a
hoax?

     ALEX: She was devastated. I mean, she's got
all the John Zorn albums and the entire
Semiotext(e) series. She was crushed.

     We see ALEX'S WIFE in the audience, weeping
softly, her hands covering her face.

     JENNY JONES: And you were raising your
daughter as a postmodernist?

     ALEX: Of course. That's what makes this
particularly tragic. I mean, how do you explain
to a 5-year old that  self-consciously recycling
cultural detritus is suddenly no longer a valid
art form when, for her entire life, she's been
taught that it is?

     JENNY JONES: Tell us how you think
postmodernism affected your career as a novelist.

     ALEX: I disavowed writing that contained
real ideas or any real passion. My work became
disjunctive, facetious and nihilistic. It was all
blank parody, irony enveloped in more irony.  It
merely recapitulated the pernicious banality of
television and advertising. I found myself
indiscriminately  incorporating any and all kinds
of pop kitsch and shlock. (He begins to weep
again.)

     JENNY JONES: And this spilled over into your
personal life?

     ALEX: It was impossible for me to experience
life with any emotional intensity. I couldn't
control the irony  anymore. I perceived my own
feelings as if they were in quotes.

     I italicized everything and everyone. It
became impossible for me to appraise the quality
of anything. To me  everything was equivalent --
the Brandenburg Concertos and the Lysol jingle
had the same value. ... (He breaks  down,
sobbing.)

 JENNY JONES: Now, you're involved in a lawsuit,
aren't you?

     ALEX: Yes. I'm suing the Modern Language
Association.

     JENNY JONES: How confident are you about
winning?

     ALEX: We need to prove that, while they were
actively propounding it, academics knew all along
that
     postmodernism was a specious theory.

     If we can unearth some intradepartmental
memos -- y'know, a paper trail -- any
corroboration that they knew  postmodernism was
worthless cant at the same time they were
teaching it, then I think we have an excellent
shot at establishing liability.

     JENNY JONES wades into audience and proffers
microphone to a woman.

     WOMAN (with lateral head-bobbing): It's
ironic that Barry Scheck is representing the
M.L.A. in this litigation   because Scheck is the
postmodern attorney par excellence. This is the
guy who's made a career of volatilizing  truth in
the simulacrum of exculpation!

     VOICE FROM AUDIENCE: You go, girl!

     WOMAN: Scheck is the guy who came up with
the quintessentially postmodern re-bleed defense
for O.J., which   claims that O.J. merely
vigorously shook Ron and Nicole, thereby
re-aggravating pre existing knife wounds. I'd
just like to say to any client of Barry Scheck --
lose that zero and get a hero!

     The AUDIENCE cheers wildly.

     WOMAN: Uh, I forgot my question.

     Dissolve to message on screen: If you
believe that mathematician Andrew Wiles' proof of
Fermat's last theorem  has caused you or a member
of your family to dress too provocatively, call
(800) 555-9455.

     Dissolve back to studio.In the audience,
JENNY JONES extends the microphone to a man in
his mid 30's with a  scruffy beard and a bandana
around his head.

     MAN WITH BANDANA: I'd like to say that this
"Alex" is the single worst example of pointless
irony in American literature, and this whole
heartfelt renunciation of postmodernism is a ploy
-- it's just more irony.

     The AUDIENCE whistles and hoots.

     ALEX: You think this is a ploy?! (He tears
futilely at the electronic blob.) This is my
face!

     The AUDIENCE recoils in horror.

     ALEX: This is what can happen to people who
naively embrace postmodernism, to people who
believe that the  individual -- the autonomous,
individualist subject -- is dead. They become a
palimpsest of media pastiche - a  mask of
metastatic irony.

     JENNY JONES (biting lip and shaking her
head): That is so sad. Alex -- final words?

     ALEX: I'd just like to say that
self-consciousness and irony seem like fun at
first, but they can destroy your life. I  know.
You gotta be earnest, be real. Real feelings are
important. Objective reality does exist.

AUDIENCE  members whoop, stomp and pump fists in
the air.

     JENNY JONES: I'd like to thank Alex for
having the courage to come on today and share his
experience with us.  Join us for tomorrow's show,
"The End of Manichean, Bipolar Geopolitics Turned
My Boyfriend Into an Insatiable Sex Freak (and I
Love It!)."

my cyberpoems,
http://www.gu.edu.au/school/art/text/speciss/issue2/kom/komintro.html

and many others writing poetry in this new medium,

all clash words, syllables and letters within a word to make space
for the interpretive input of the end-user.

i am unaware of this in non-web literature of the past.
perhaps i am wrong.

ee cummings often broke up words over lines in a poem to achieve a
similar result.

i think olson was doing something similar in his projective verse but
using expression to clash syllables within a word?

but, and please correct me if i am wrong, the langpo poetry of the
1980s, generally,  clashed statements with statements within lines of
poetry.


i am basing my paper for e-Poetry 2001 on this theory of letter and
syllable parataxis.
so if someone has already written something along these lines already,
or if anyone can help, me i'd be grateful.

SEMINAR DESCRIPTIONS
(CHECK WEBSITE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION)

Pamela Caughie  (Loyola U. Chicago)  PASSING IN/AS/FOR MODERNISM  This
seminar will employ the concept of passing to represent the negotiations
of identity boundaries and forms of cross-cultural identification in
modernist cultural productions.

Patrick Collier (Ball State U.)  MODERNIST COLLISIONS WITH THE POPULAR
This seminar will examine the relationship between modernism and
popularculture,
with particular emphasis on 1) how modernists view both
popularculture and the concept of popularity and 2) how commentators in
"popular" media (newspapers, radio, etc.) view modernism.

John Xiros Cooper (U. of Vancouver)  MODERNISM AND MASS MEDIA  How do we
rewrite the history of modernism today to account for its extraordinary
conquest of the everyday in  the age of  turbo-capitalism? What does this
desegregation of bohemia do to our concepts of modernism's "cultural
elitism," to notions of the avant-garde, and to the inscription of
aesthetic value in modernist works as a resistance to the blight of
commerce?

Jean Gallagher (Polytechnic U.)  LITERARY MODERNISM AND VISUAL CULTURE
How have modernist writers and texts responded to changes and developments
in the visual culture and technologies of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries? Emerging models of subjectivity within modernist visual culture
and effect on production and reception of literary texts.  Models of
text/image interaction.

Nancy Gish (U. of Southern Maine)  CANONS AND CONTEXTS:  MODERNITY AND
NATIONALITY IN BRITAIN   This seminar will examine how different Modernist
"canons" shaped the work of later poets in different ways.  Our emphasis
will be on the continuing importance and effect of work by Eliot, Yeats,
and MacDiarmid, but other "canonical" poets and later writers from regions
of Britain can also be included.

Jon Hegglund (Central Connecticut State)  MODERNISM AND GEOGRAPHY  This
seminar invites papers that consider  the relationship between modernist
aesthetics and geographical knowlege. The "time-space" compression described
by David Harvey and others coincides with the end of an "heroic" period of
geography characterized by imperial cultures of exploration and discovery.
The seminar will consider questions related to this epistemic shift in the
experience and representation of space.

Lynne Huffer (Rice)  GAY PARIS  This seminar will explore the historical,
political, and theoretical importance of queer cultural production in
Paris during the modernist period.

Cyraina Johnson-Rouillier (Notre Dame)  GEOGRAPHIES, MODERNITIES, AND THE
QUESTION OF RACE  What is the significance of the changing geography of
modernism, and how does it affect our understanding of the relation between
modernity and race?  The tension between modernism and modernity in multiple
cultural contexts.

Walter Kalaidjian  (Emory)  TRAUMA AND ADDRESS IN MODERN POETRY   Modern
literature as an important site for discerning trauma and its meanings as
they are inscribed in textual practice.  Because less attention has been
given to traces of trauma in verse than in fiction, film, and the
performing arts, this seminar will investigate the ways in which trauma
registers address in modern poetry of the 20th century.

Linda A. Kinnahan (Duquesne U.) and Maeera Shreiber (Utah)  THE STATUS OF
GENDER IN MODERNIST STUDIES   This seminar proposes- a decade after the
landmark anthology *The Gender of Modernism*--to focus upon the status of
gender as a critical category within modernist studies across the disciplines.

Kurt Koenisberger (Case Western) and William Kupinse (Tulsa) GLOBALIZATION
AND THE CLIMATE OF MODERNISM  This seminar will investigate the emergence and
dissemination of modernism within the context of globalization.

Dejan Kuzmanovic (Wisconsin)  MODERNISM AND MASCULINITY  In what sense
could modernism, or certain manifestations of it, be described as
masculine?  Is it possible -- and in what sense -- to talk about modernist
masculinity or masculinities?

Holly Laird (Tulsa)   COLLABORATION/COLLABORATIONISM/CO-AUTHORSHIP AND
MODERNITY This seminar will investigate varied manifestations of both
collaborative and collaborationist texts from the 1880s to the present.

Nana Last (Rice)  FROM TRANSPARENCY TO OCCLUSION:  MAPPING MODERNISM'S
SURFACES  This seminar proposes the terms "transparency" and "occlusion"
as a way of understanding the construction of meaning in either specific
works or methodologies in architecture, the arts and humanities in the
twentieth century.

James Lastra and Scarlett Higgins (U. of Chicago)  CITATIONALITY AND COLLAGE
IN POETIC, MUSICAL, AND VISUAL CULTURE   Collage, montage, assemblage,
pastiche, and documentary forms have been a key formal aspect of modernist
aesthetic production since the first stirrings of the avant-garde.  This
seminar will explore the potential and persistence of these techniques
across media, with an emphasis on their use in late modernity.

Doug Mao (Harvard)  MODERNISM AND THE UTOPIAN  A seminar on how modernists
imagined -- or resisted imagining--healthier environments, juster orders,
perfected societies, brave new worlds.

Joseph McLaughlin (Ohio U.)   SITES OF MODERNISM    Specific physical
locations of modernism as represented in literature, visual arts,
geography, architecture, urban planning, ethnography, travel literature
and other discourses.

Mark Morrisson (Penn State)  NEW APPROACHES TO LITTLE MAGAZINES  This
seminar will encourage participants to approach little magazines not
simply as venues for now-neglected writers, artists, musicians, but
rather as a window on the culture of modernity.

Peter Naccarato (Marymount Manhattan)  MODERNIST BOUNDARIES AND BOUNDARY
CROSSINGS The need to confront, question, and move beyond boundaries (norms and
traditions, disciplines and genres, cultural and historical identities) as
a central modernist concern.

Charles W. Pollard (Calvin College)  CONTEMPORARY REVISIONS OF MODERNISM
Questioning the narrative that contemporary writing must "oppose"
modernism.  How have contemporary artists renewed and revised the texts,
principles, strategies, forms or techniques of modernism? Focus on
instances of specific contemporary artists engaging with
modernist precursors.

Marilyn Reizbaum (Bowdoin)  THE DEGENERATION OF MODERNISM This seminar
will explore theories of degeneration (e.g., Nordau, Ellis, Lombroso) and
their legacy for modernisms and modernity.

John Paul Riquelme  (Boston U.)  POSTCOLONIALITIES OF LITERARY MODERNISMS
This seminar will revolve around theoretically informed readings of
literature of the long twentieth century (Wilde forward) that bring
together, under the conceptual umbrella of postcoloniality, modernist and
postmodernist writers from various locales and ethnic groups whose texts
reflect the dislocations of modernity, including Irish, American Southern,
post-war African-American, and Caribbean writers among others.

Patricia Juliana Smith (Hofstra)  MODERNISM, LESBIAN DISCOURSE, AND THE
PROBLEMS OF NATIONAL IDENTITY  The Modernist period saw a specifically
lesbian or "Sapphist" sensibility manifested in literature and related
arts.  This phenomenon occurs almost simultaneously with the advent of a
particularly virulent form of nationalism and racism in the Western world.
This seminar will examine the various ways in which lesbian literature, art,
and culture were affected, even shaped, by the politics of national and/or
racial identity during this period.

Luca Somigli (U. of Toronto) MODERNISM AND TECHNOLOGY   The relationship
between technology and cultural production in modernism:  the role of
technology in transforming the process of cultural production; new forms
of aesthetics fostered by or theorized in relation to technological
innovations; the representation of technology in modernist literature.

Barrett Watten (Wayne State U.)  AVANT-GARDES AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY
This seminar will seek to obtain an overview of the ways avant-gardes in
literature and art have been accounted for historically, how they have
incorporated historical materials and motivations, and the relation
between these two forms of historicity.

Philip Weinstein (Swarthmore) and Ian Baucom (Duke)  BENJAMIN:
MEMORY,EXPERIENCE, AND THE  DESIGNS OF MODERNISM  This seminar will
explore Benjamin's reframings or recastings of "modernism," as well as
investigate the inter-articulation of certain key figures of his thought
with some of the central concerns of modernist aesthetics and practice.
Open to specialists and non-specialists.

Steven Yao (Ohio State U.)  OTHER MODE-RNISMS   Alternative modes of
modernist cultural production e.g., manifesto, educational handbook).The
significance of  alternative avenues of cultural production and the impact
their technological or practical dimensions might have for the
consistencies and fractures of Modernism as a critical and historical
category.

I just wanted to say that I met Ramez after a short correspondendence with
him (regarding a short review or two he sent to Rhizome).  He was indeed a
very smart and rigorous thinker with a boisterous laugh.

He did indeed come out west to LA to see the Otis Writing Program, I was
struck by his utter devotion to all things literary, to Adorno particularly,
and his eagerness to discuss poetics/politics.  I'm very sad to hear of his
passing.  He did not enroll, however, and I recall him briefly saying that
he had some psychiatric concerns to address.  I only with that I'd put
myself out more to get to know him better.

It is with great sadness and utter shock that I pass on this note just in
from Gary Sullivan. I am sending out as a separate post a letter from his
sister to our list, which Gary also forwarded to me.

I corresponded by email with Ramez and had some lively discussions with him
at readings, as well as avidly reading his reviews and essays. (A quick
search on Google.com came up with a number of his pieces.)

This is the place to quote a poem, to console or maybe add some perspective.

Maybe later.

Subject: Ramez Qureshi, 1972-2001

Hello everyone,

I have some very sad news to report. Ramez Qureshi, who many of you will
know from this list as well as from his critical writing and poetry on
various online & in print magazines, passed away last Saturday night,
apparently by his own hand, although the details at this time are still not
entirely clear. He was 28.

I first "met" Ramez online, in response to a call in 1999 I put on the list
for the first issue of Readme. He wrote asking if I'd be interested in a
review of J.H. Prynne's Poems. I was thrilled that someone wanted to write
about Prynne, and was curious about who Ramez was: Who would brave a review
of Prynne's Poems? So, I begged him to send it, which he did. It was a
brilliant review, obviously the product of careful reading and a real love
of the work. I was amazed that I was going to get to publish it. Ramez
continued to send me reviews, essays and poetry (he wrote on Armand
Schwerner, Stuart Merrill, Mark Rothko), and I began to see his work popping
up in some of my favorite online and in print journals: How2, Lagniappe,
Jacket, Rain Taxi, Riding the Meridian, Cauldron & Net, Lynx: Poetry from
Bath, where he wrote about Barbara Guest, Johanna Drucker, John Cage, Tom
Raworth, Nick Piombino, Michel Foucault ... as well as, less frequently,
publishing his own poetry. It was clear that he lived for poetry -- for
writing in general -- was a voracious, careful, loving and diverse reader,
and though he kept most of it to himself, a prolific and engaging poet. (His
uncle Rafique Kathwari, a poet himself, said that despite the fact that he
and Ramez talked often about poetry and writing, Ramez never showed him any
of his poetry.)

In a post of his from November of 1999, Ramez said: "Marjorie Perloff was
wrong. I 'need' poetry." I don't think I've personally met anyone for whom
this was more true.

I didn't know at first that Ramez lived in the New York area ... not until I
got an email message from him asking for directions to a reading. I was
shocked to find out that he'd never been to the Poetry Project before,
especially when he told me that he had spent most of his life in Westchester
County, just north of the city. Soon, Ramez began coming to more events, and
on occasion Nada & I would get a call from him, and we'd either hang out
before and or after this or that event. When we heard that certain poets
would be reading soon, we began to assume that Ramez would be calling, or
that we might see him at the reading.

Once, Nada and I had dinner with Ramez and his sister Sofie, who was about
to move from New York City to San Francisco to study environmental science.
I think at that time, Ramez had gotten into Otis College of Art and Design
in Los Angeles, and was very excited by the prospect of getting to study
with Douglas Messerli and (I think) Leslie Scalapino. But, days before he
was set to move, he decided against it. I later asked him why, but he said
that he had just decided to stay in New York and study computer programming.
I was taken aback by this, and began to slowly realize that leaving and
being away from home must have meant much more for him than most. I knew
that Ramez had suffered from chronic depression, and once when he was
supposed to meet up with me & Nada to see Clark Coolidge & Michael  Gizzi
read he didn't show up, and called later from a hospital, saying that he had
"gotten sick." But I didn't know the whole story until talking with Sofie
and Ramez's friends & other family after the prayers and burial this
Tuesday. I'm beginning to realize now just how much poetry meant to Ramez,
and how much his fairly recent entry into the world of letters, his
acceptance by the various magazines that he read and returned to, meant to
him. I realized that it meant a lot to his friends and family, too.

Sofie has asked me to forward a letter she has written to the everyone here
about just that. She's also asking for help in locating all of Ramez's work
in publication. If you published anything of Ramez Qureshi's, or if you
corresponded with him, please get in touch with her.

Ramez was not only one of the most brilliant people I've ever met (I felt
like the laziest reader in the world hanging out with him, he could quote
from so much), he  was also the sweetest. He will be greatly missed.

How many people have I gotten to know on this list, then
met in person years later in Orono, Louisville, Chicago, or DC?  How many
of us were waiting to meet Ramez and now never will?  Fuck.

Searching around on the net this morning for Ramez's works, I came across
a picture of him (smiling, beautiful) alongside his review of Hejinian's
_Happily_.  It's at

Bob:

Aren't poetry contests also important because they get books published?  I
mean, if for no other reason than that an unpublished poet can have access
to a serious publisher that they otherwise wouldn't?  Is the poet to be
condemned for sustaining poetic heirarchies or are publishers simply using a
marketing gimmick, one they obviously feel is helpful?  I really can't say
that contests are stupid.  They are sadly almost necessary.  How many
younger poets get published without either winning a contest or some form of
nepotism?   You seem to think that competition is being generated from
within poetic communities (publishing communities?), but isn't it simply
endemic to the entire culture?  Furthermore, how many people really think
contest winners are really better than contest finalists?  It seems like
we're also cynical now about such things that we just assume that the winner
is either well-connected or lucky (in that their aesthetic lines up with the
judges).

Are there any judges out there who would like to shed light on what they
think the contests actually achieve?

At another time, I'd be happy to discuss some of the points you raised, I
suspect we're largely in agreement - right now, I'm so busy with work (no
time even for poetry, let alone list discussions) that I'll have to pass.
Sorry, but your post deserves the sort of thoughtful response that I can't
manage at the moment - if you've ever tried to get a class of 13 yr old
drama students ready for a performance with limited time and lessons lost
because of cross-country runs etc., you'll know how I feel.

all the best

FOR GENERAL RELEASE

POLI-POETRY 2001 in MAASTRICHT.

For three days in May 2001 (11th to 13th) the city of Maastricht in the

the century, produced by Mhr. Paul Coenjaarts of the "Intro / In Situ"
Foundation, an organisation with many years of experience in the staging of
Audio- and New Music events.

I've been calling this kind of thing "infraverbal
poetry" for quite a while.  The portmanteau words of
Lewis Carroll probably started it for moderns in
English.  The first great user of such words in English
for aesthetic purposes was Joyce.  Aram Saroyan in
the seventies was an important infraverbal poet.
Many visual poets also do such poems, such as
Jonathan Brannen, Karl Kempton, Geof Huth, Richard
Kostelanetz, LeRoy Gorman, Michael Basinski, Me . . .
Miekal was doing such words long before he did
it online.

I have an article on it under the heading "Infraverbal
Poetry" in Kostelanetz's recent A Dictionary of
the Avant-Gardes.  Also an article at light and dust

(http://www.thing.net/~grist/l&d/grumman/egrumn.htm)

that, among other things, discusses a few infraverbal poems.

In lieu of a more formal pitch (which may come later):

POG, Tucson's poetry group, needs to raise around $ 800 in the next couple
of months to balance our annual programming budget.

we hope you'll consider helping out in one or more of the following ways:

1. buying either or both of our anthologies, POG ONE and POG TWO ($5 a copy)
2. buying a POG t-shirt, w snazzy logo ($15 each)
3. making a donation to POG
4. attending our benefit dinner (fancy sit-down or pretty fancy quasi
potluck, still to be determined; stay tuned!)

Everyone receiving this mailing presumably knows about POG; but if you'd
like more information please just email me and I'll provide some (mission
statement, programming history, plans for 2001-2002 program, etc).

POG is a 501c3 non-profit corporation and all contributions are fully tax
deductible to the extent allowed by law.  We'll be happy to provide written
documentation concerning your contribution, upon request.

snailmail address for contributions, or for further information if you
prefer snailmail to email:

POG
7931 East Presidio Road
Tucson, AZ  85750

many thanks for your help,

Is tthis reward truly meaningful to those who post on this thread? I see no
reason to disparage either the quality or the social importance of Langston
Hughes's contributions to literature and poetry.

THE PEOPLE'S POETRY GATHERING THIS WEEK!!!!!
Fri. Mar 30-Sun, April 1
For tickets and info call 212-529-1955
or visit http://www.peoplespoetry.org
Sponsored by City Lore and Poets House

Sunday's NYTimes features THE SAGA OF SABA KIDANE: A Poet, Barred at Gates,
with photos, poems and a deep analysis of the absurdity of US Immigration
Policy in forbidding this brilliant young Eritrean poet from coming to the
US. Catch THE POETRY OF RESISTANCE (Friday, 3/30, 9pm, Great Hall --
following Stanley Kunitz). Join Eritrean Poet laureate Reesom Haille, Dub
poets Linton Kwesi Johnson and Jean Binta Breeze, and others to hear poetry
fight back, and to witness a video tribute to Saba Kidane! Sign a petition
for her at http://www.asmarino.com

MANIFESTOS ON PARADE! Join Mary Ann Caws and Charles Bernstein and a host of
others at the Great Hall of Cooper Union on Sunday, April 1, 4PM, to
celebrate Caws' new anthology. It's Historic!

JERRY ROTHENBERG TURNS 70! six months early! still, what would NatPoMo be w/o
a gala birthday dance party? Join in the Action Poetry Event at the Kitchen,
512 W. 19, 9-mid, Sat, Mar 31, $10.

WALDMAN VS. CRUZ IN THE CENTER RING!
Anne Waldman, the Fast-Speaking Woman, takes on Victor Hernandez Cruz, the
only Puerto Rican poet-in-exile in Morocco!  A rematch of the World
Heavyweight Poetry Championship called by many the Greatest--Ever!  Cruz
tosses down the gauntlet: It's gonna be on the canvas on the ropes and like
wrestling out on the floor. The last time there was a full moon--la femme
used it to convince the judges, but this ain't no Taos, this is the big
Mango. Chop it up, Anne!

LATE-NITE WE DO THE WILD THING:
Gathering clock does not stop. Midnight Friday at the Culture Project (home
of Oyl!), Elena Alexander's Polymorphously/PerVerse II reprises the hugely
successful erotic (x-rated!) reading of the last Gathering .... Midnight
Saturday, the historic Marble Cemetery (2nd Ave between 2nd and 3rd) is the
site of Poe in the Graveyard with read-alongs of The Raven, Rev. Billy's
sermon, and Thomas Lynch joining the undertaking.... Sunday at 8 is Patti
Smith & Band -- buy tickets now!...

First, the doing: Hear the freshest voices straight from the CAVE CANEM
workshops in the African-American Poetry Showcase on Friday at 2 at Hewitt.
Then the theory: Cave Canem also presents a panel on the Black Postmodern
Avant Garde on Sunday at 1.

Carol Conroy's MEMORY CIRCLE is open to new members--learn a poem (not your
own) by heart, then let your heart speak.  That's 2PM Sunday at Poets House.

OYL! has kicked up quite a stir. We saw Denise Duhamel and Maureen Seatons
text faced-out at the just-opened (and must-see!) Poetry Publication Showcase
at Poets House--gorgeous! Emily Rems production of the true tale of Popeye's
gal starts in the comic strip but quickly gets sexually progressive with some
utterly unexpected personality twists. The play opens with the Gathering on
Friday March 30th at the Culture Project's Bleecker Theatre, NYC's premier
space in the support of spoken word.  For more info, call the OYL Hotline at
(914) 582-8417.

here in the city, there are more bricks than humans, cast-off and rusted
iron hanging from roofs and lintels. any falling object certainly would
kill the delicate inside-out flesh walking beneath them. everyone tends
the crayfish, hiding out until the middle of the night, emerging slowly
with clumsy and close-to-weightless carapace, bottom-crawling. the
shakuhachi is kept in a closed and plastic world, an evaporation-dish
nearby. the fish are fed thrice daily; the cat, twice. the plants are
watered twice or thrice weekly, the large opuntia cleaned monthly, the
guitars reglued twice yearly, the piccolo oiled thrice yearly, shakuhachi
oiled every third month. the piccolo is swabbed after every use, the
shakuhachi as well. the computer is cleaned thrice weekly, the books
weekly, the television set twice weekly. teeth are brushed thrice daily;
the body showers daily. the fish fry are fed twice daily; the stairs are
swept twice yearly. i take pills twice daily, the computer is defragged
monthly, disks cleaned up twice monthly. portable batteries are recharged
twice a month, the pocket computer is recharged daily, the laptop is
recharged twice monthly. the aquarium is cleaned every six weeks, my hair
is cut once every two months, my nails are trimmed twice monthly, my
guitar tuned twice monthly, email answered five times daily, cache emptied
once daily, software upgraded once monthly, teeth examined twice yearly,
body examined twice yearly, blood taken three times yearly, computers
upgraded every two years, aquarium filter changed every two months, floor
vacuumed every three weeks, facial hair shaved daily, pubic hair cut
yearly, dishes washed every two days, refrigerator de-iced twice yearly,
curating events once monthly, napping twice daily, making love four or
five times weekly, sleeping once daily, eating twice daily, reading five
times daily, talking ten times daily, writing four times daily, taping,
practicing music; it's a miracle bricks and iron take so long in downward
plunge.

I certainly won't think it's a farce if Hughes wins. I think his Montage of
a Dream Deferred is a pretty amazing work. But I also thought he had been
on an earlier stamp.

And if you cant find a book I may be able to help as I buy and sell second
hand books and remember that I can offer books generally at a better price
than in the US because of the exchange rate. Or I can tell you where to
look. Addall. Search on a good search engine and add it to your favourites
and Abebooks or Bibliofind are all on Addall. But if you dont know the
second hand book trade you may not be able to see the wood for the trees.
But that's the best way. I have a lot of books but the postage from here is
fairly high. But I still think I can get most books over to the US quite
quickly for reasonable rates. I'll discount for list people anyway and so
on. You can bargain with me. On my book stall in Auckland the peole who are
nice to me etc get good discounts! The grumpy old people I sometimes put the
prices up. Most young people are pretty good to deal with and of a cetain
age or type seem to have more money than the old "grumpies" -  but I
generalising. Eg. I'm selling a copy (it was mine until I got another one)
of "In The American Tree" by Silliman and Andrews and at a nominal NZ$15.00
that's about  US$6.20 but I'd "let it go" for US$4.50 as its "ungluing" but
is complete. So the postage (could be more than the book unfortunately) is
about US$8.00 which is US$12.50. Make that US$10.80. The book's probably
worth that. In a bettter state I'd want about US$17.00. Remember though that
all the info is in there.  In other cases the postage is proportionately
less than the book price. Just depends if you can get it more readily. I've
had to buy a few books from the US and the postage + exchange rate kills it
or makes it expensive. But I'm more frequently faeling in fairly rare books.
Hard to get poetry books that I dont want to keep! Richard Taylor.

Your right. I was just thinking about the way some people think "technology"
is a 20th century thing. The innovations come with and despite and because
of technological changes which also affect all the other "ogicals" and
"iticals". The innovations yet to be seen and in process will be marvellous
but the fundamental human dilemmas will never change: love, death,
suffering, joy... the whole big range of human experience. Computers etc are
tools only. But your take is interesting. Regards,Richard.

I've just noticed this. I red Patrick's poems a bit mystified. Ramez was the
same age as my own son.  Its a fuck off when its someone so young. As a
parent I know how his parents will be. It is terrible. Nothing else I can
say. Never met him. Feel as if I knew him. Richard.

It is with great sadness and utter shock that I pass on this note just in
from Gary Sullivan. I am sending out as a separate post a letter from his
sister to our list, which Gary also forwarded to me.

I corresponded by email with Ramez and had some lively discussions with him
at readings, as well as avidly reading his reviews and essays. (A quick
search on Google.com came up with a number of his pieces.)

This is the place to quote a poem, to console or maybe add some perspective.

Maybe later.

Subject: Ramez Qureshi, 1972-2001

Hello everyone,

I have some very sad news to report. Ramez Qureshi, who many of you will
know from this list as well as from his critical writing and poetry on
various online & in print magazines, passed away last Saturday night,
apparently by his own hand, although the details at this time are still not
entirely clear. He was 28.

I first "met" Ramez online, in response to a call in 1999 I put on the list
for the first issue of Readme. He wrote asking if I'd be interested in a
review of J.H. Prynne's Poems. I was thrilled that someone wanted to write
about Prynne, and was curious about who Ramez was: Who would brave a review
of Prynne's Poems? So, I begged him to send it, which he did. It was a
brilliant review, obviously the product of careful reading and a real love
of the work. I was amazed that I was going to get to publish it. Ramez
continued to send me reviews, essays and poetry (he wrote on Armand
Schwerner, Stuart Merrill, Mark Rothko), and I began to see his work popping
up in some of my favorite online and in print journals: How2, Lagniappe,
Jacket, Rain Taxi, Riding the Meridian, Cauldron & Net, Lynx: Poetry from
Bath, where he wrote about Barbara Guest, Johanna Drucker, John Cage, Tom
Raworth, Nick Piombino, Michel Foucault ... as well as, less frequently,
publishing his own poetry. It was clear that he lived for poetry -- for
writing in general -- was a voracious, careful, loving and diverse reader,
and though he kept most of it to himself, a prolific and engaging poet. (His
uncle Rafique Kathwari, a poet himself, said that despite the fact that he
and Ramez talked often about poetry and writing, Ramez never showed him any
of his poetry.)

In a post of his from November of 1999, Ramez said: "Marjorie Perloff was
wrong. I 'need' poetry." I don't think I've personally met anyone for whom
this was more true.

I didn't know at first that Ramez lived in the New York area ... not until I
got an email message from him asking for directions to a reading. I was
shocked to find out that he'd never been to the Poetry Project before,
especially when he told me that he had spent most of his life in Westchester
County, just north of the city. Soon, Ramez began coming to more events, and
on occasion Nada & I would get a call from him, and we'd either hang out
before and or after this or that event. When we heard that certain poets
would be reading soon, we began to assume that Ramez would be calling, or
that we might see him at the reading.

Once, Nada and I had dinner with Ramez and his sister Sofie, who was about
to move from New York City to San Francisco to study environmental science.
I think at that time, Ramez had gotten into Otis College of Art and Design
in Los Angeles, and was very excited by the prospect of getting to study
with Douglas Messerli and (I think) Leslie Scalapino. But, days before he
was set to move, he decided against it. I later asked him why, but he said
that he had just decided to stay in New York and study computer programming.
I was taken aback by this, and began to slowly realize that leaving and
being away from home must have meant much more for him than most. I knew
that Ramez had suffered from chronic depression, and once when he was
supposed to meet up with me & Nada to see Clark Coolidge & Michael  Gizzi
read he didn't show up, and called later from a hospital, saying that he had
"gotten sick." But I didn't know the whole story until talking with Sofie
and Ramez's friends & other family after the prayers and burial this
Tuesday. I'm beginning to realize now just how much poetry meant to Ramez,
and how much his fairly recent entry into the world of letters, his
acceptance by the various magazines that he read and returned to, meant to
him. I realized that it meant a lot to his friends and family, too.

Sofie has asked me to forward a letter she has written to the everyone here
about just that. She's also asking for help in locating all of Ramez's work
in publication. If you published anything of Ramez Qureshi's, or if you
corresponded with him, please get in touch with her.

Ramez was not only one of the most brilliant people I've ever met (I felt
like the laziest reader in the world hanging out with him, he could quote
from so much), he  was also the sweetest. He will be greatly missed.

i agree that the hundreds of first-book and other poetry prizes give young
poets (like me) more chances to be published than without them. but i don't
see why the system had to exist as a series of contests, with all the
problems (well rehearsed) associated with them--corruptible judges, etc., to
say nothing of the silliness of the notion of a "prize-winning " poet.  i
believe carnegie-mellon press simply charges a fee for reading manuscripts,
and has an in-house panel that picks their books for the year. not that this
is the only or ideal way to run a press, but because no one single person is
responsible for selecting a book, it seems more likely poetry will win out
over connections. and the fee means the press gets revenue to print the
series. there must be other alternatives to the prize system.

Unpublished poets win contests?  If yes, I would
still maintain that contests are generally stupid
because all they really do is cheat the public by
labeling some poet an editor or editorial board
has decided to publish instead of others a contest
winner.  And serious publishers (i.e., visible
publishers) use almost nothing but certified
poets and critics to judge their contests (when
the contests aren't fixed, however unconsciously),
so you get almost no winners but certified poets
and imitators of certified poets.

> Is the poet to be condemned for sustaining
> poetic heirarchies

Not condemned, but pronounced dumb to be wasting his
time entering contests, especially the ones he has
to pay to enter!  Unless he's an imitator of certified
poets.

> or are publishers simply using a
> marketing gimmick, one they obviously feel is helpful?

As I said, it's a lie and it doesn't work.  Instead of
a publisher getting a hundred submissions and choosing
one to publish, say, he gets a hundred ENTRIES, and
chooses one to publish that he calls a prize-winner.
And half the poetry books published are prize-winners,
so why should any half-intelligent reader get excited
about one such book?  I used to boast that none of
the poets I published was a prize winner but recently
I published Ivan Arguelles.  I can still brag that none
of the 150 or so books I've published has won a prize.

Not many, I'm sure.  But I suspect the same number
would be published if there were no contests as
are now published with them.

> You seem to think that competition is being generated from

Yes, to the entire culture and to the entire species.
I don't want to abolish it, I want to make it intelligent.

> Furthermore, how many people really think
> contest winners are really better than contest finalists?

And how many people really think contest winners are
better than contest losers?  As one whose poetry
got a score of 17 out of a possible 40, where a 28 was
needed to advance in a Florida State poetry contest,
I am understandably of the view that contest losers
are superior to contest winners--or, more accurately, that
while most contest losers are probably even more inept
than most contest winners, more superior poets will
be found among contest losers than among contest winners,
and that the best poets will never win any contests until
they've forced their way into prominence through other means.

Yes.

A few have said a little at this discussion group
but I frankly can't remember what they said.

Assuming this report is legitimate (that Langston Hughes is indeed
"leading"),--- well, then, that's good news!

It suggests that African Americans are organizing to promote their
constituency's image in the stamp vote.  It's a helpful reminder that "taste" is
a consequence of group formation.

Poetry is not about a picture of a poet's face.

If Langston Hughes were to enjoy a return into notoriety, it might promote a
bracing influence toward the short, short poem, a tradition way on the decline.

The composer Ricky Ian Gordon did some pleasant musical settings of Langston
Hughes (as have several composers).  Major opera divas have recorded them, and
recently some dramatist was brought in to write theatrical bridges linking the
poems of the song cycle, a story play trussed up to segue between the
poem-songs.

Think of Hughes as a sort of Black, failed Aram Saroyan.  The tragedy of his
career was that his historical period didn't permit him to use fewer words.

He believed that the alphabet was too long, and that Qs should be replaced with
Ks, soft Cs with hard Cs, and Hs with apostrophes.  He said that semi-colons
should be used only when two lines of type are printed too closely and overlap,
squishing a period directly on top of a comma.

Web sauntering and chocolate milking! Dangerous. But this I found amusing.
One could imagine some witty skits using the terminology of certain
individuals or groups. But I must admit to a penchant for italiscising.I
dont know if this put me off postmodernism or chocolate milk. Chocolate milk
is fairly identifiable but the trouble with postmodernism is whose using the
term There seem to be a near infinite number of postmodernisms and other
isms. Richard.

    What Komninos is remarking on--that cyberspace has opened up parataxis
among letters, syllables--has existed as long as there have been letters,
syllables--sometimes it is that things may go unnoticed until placed in a
different context, in this case medium of presentation.
    A new medium may make one aware of things which had been camouflaged, as
it were, by habit--habits of taking for granted the "old" media--its
presentations--to such an extent--that placed in a different or "new"
context--that which was there all along--is suddenly dis/uncovered--

    "The shock of the new"--or--"the shock of recognition"? Often it is that
one has been unaware of the camouflage of habit--at other times, it is the
experience of the uncanny--that which is at once strange yet familiar.  One
is suddenly aware of having seen things for a long time, without noticing
them, as it were.

    An excellent and most illuminating text in this regard is Gertrude
Stein's "Composition as Explanation."  In this piece, Stein walking down Pari
s streets late in the First World War with Picasso, sees for the first time
the newly camouflaged tanks then making quite an impression, with their
abstract painted planes of subtly varying colors designed to bewilder the
eye--and Picasso remarked:  "We (Cubist painters) have already done that."

    The point being--the effect may not be noticed until the medium, the
technology, provides a different context, in which camouflage is revealed . .
.

    In the study of petroglyphs, many objects and markings are found--of
which it is difficult to distinguish which are intentional, (human made
intentionality--animals and birds, insects among others to be sure have there
own various intentionalities in making markings) and which simply made by
functions of nature--chemical decomposition among rocks--or way a stick had
been blown and embedded in mud and solidified with time into a seeming
"mark", "notation"--the question thus arising:--did humans imitate these
markings in constructing slowly a form of notation?  or does one recognize
the interest of these natural markings--because they resemble those one knows
from human notations in use?

    The same question with Komninos' remarks, his theory, re cyberspace and
parataxis among syllables and letters--is it that cyberspace is really making
something new in writing, or simply presenting in a different context that
which is already in use--and providing rather a different form of reading, in
which that which was camouflaged by habit, "overlooked"-- is more readily
apparent?

    "It is not the elements which are new, but the order of their
arrangement"--Pascal

An afternoon reading with
MILTON MURAYAMA

Thursday afternoon March 29
4:30 pm, free
@ The Poetry Center, SFSU

MILTON MURAYAMA is the celebrated author of a remarkable tetralogy of
novels centered on the Oyama family saga and plantation life among the
Japanese in Hawaii.  All I Asking For Is My Body, his moving debut novel,
originally appeared in 1975, and has since become an underground classic,
hailed as the "only comprehensive literary treatment of the Hawaii
plantation experience, an experience which either directly or indirectly
affects a very large segment of Hawaii's population" (Arnold Hiura, The
Hawaii Herald).  The novel later won an American Book Award and was picked
up by the University of Hawaii Press, which has kept it in print since.
That book was followed by Five Years on a Rock (1994) and Plantation Boy
(1998), all from the University of Hawaii Press.  The fourth and final
novel of the tetralogy, A Good Life, is in progress.  Born on Maui in 1923,
Mr. Murayama grew up in a sugar plantation company town of several hundred
workers and their families that no longer exists.  During World War II he
served as a language interpreter in India and Taiwan, and later received an
MA in Chinese and Japanese from Columbia University.   He lives in San
=46rancisco.

WILLIAM CORBETT AND SIRI HUSTVEDT
William Corbett's many books of poetry and prose include Philip Guston's
Late Work: A Memoir; Furthering My Education; and New and Selected Poems
(Zoland Books, 1999). Robert Creeley writes of William Corbett, "The skills
of this poet are so quietly and firmly established in his work that one is
apt to forget about them in either reading or hearing-which is, of course,
their mastery." Mr. Corbett is also an editor of the magazine Pressed Wafer.
Siri Hustvedt is the author of a book of poems, Reading to You; two novels,
The Blindfold (1992) and The Enchantment of Lily Dahl (1996); as well as a
book of essays, Yonder. Her work has been translated into fifteen languages.

PATRICIA SPEARS JONES AND MAGGIE NELSON
Patricia Spears Jones is the author of the book of poems The Weather That
Kills (Coffee House Press, 1995). The poems in The Weather That Kills,
frequently inspired by the artistry of great blues and jazz musicians, are
clear-sighted, generous, and compassionate. "She is a wise, sophisticated,
and tough poet who writes with a marvelous combination of street-smart
eloquence and earthy passion," writes Jessica Hagedorn. Maggie Nelson is the
author of a book of poems entitled Shiner, forthcoming from Hanging Loose
Press this spring, and The Scratch-Scratch Diaries, featured in
AGNI/Graywolf Press' Take Three: 3, New Poets Series. Robert Creeley writes,
"I love the way all [Maggie Nelson] says keeps moving, insistent, often
abrasive, like they say, and always specific. Can it get any better? I don't
think so."


Friday, April 6th at 10:30 PM
A CELEBRATION OF KENNETH REXROTH'S SWORDS THAT SHALL NOT STRIKE: POEMS OF
PROTEST AND REBELLION
Readers include Grace Paley, Eliot Weinberger, Eileen Myles, Ishle Park,
Robert Nichols, and the book's editor, Geoffrey Gardner. A founder of the
San Francisco literary renaissance of the late 1950s, Kenneth Rexroth
(1905-1982) was integral to the emergence of the Beat poets. He was a
confirmed anarchist for most of his life, first socialist, then a
syndicalist. At this reading, poets will read selections from Swords That
Shall Not Strike and then follow with their own work, with the aim of
illustrating Mr. Rexroth's claim that "the poet, by the very nature of
his/her art, has been an enemy of society."


*  *  *


Unless otherwise noted, admission to all events is $7, $4 for students and
seniors, and $3 for Poetry Project members. Schedule is subject to change.
The Poetry Project, located in St. Mark's Church at the corner of 2nd Avenue
and 10th Street in Manhattan, is wheelchair accessible with assistance and
advance notice. Please call (212) 674-0910 for more information or visit our

An artistic project by Felix S. Huber and Florian Wustin in cooperation
with Udo Noll within the framework of the 'Art and Wind Energy on the
occasion of the World Exhibition' project, Hannover/Germany.

'skytalk' transforms the wind turbine generator Garbsen-Schloss Ricklingen
into an informative and narrative platform accessible to everyone - by day
and by night, throughout the year. Via skytalk.org and the local terminal
in the Garbsen-Nord motorway service station, personal messages, all types
of information and anecdotes, complete sentences and individual words can
be input and transmitted in real time to the newscaster displays on top of
the wind turbine generator.

The text input is structured in such a way that it is possible to hold a
dialogue with other visitors to the chat channel at skytalk.org. If there
is no chat partner available worldwide, then information on wind energy,
renewable energy forms and ecological topics are called up automatically.
In addition, the 'weird-words' programme is active, which can create
surprisingly new connections between sense and non-sense from literary
texts and the stored input messages and transmit these to the newscaster
displays.

I reply:

Though, of course (thinking back on the history of American
publishing) I agree with this statement (mostly), I can't quite
get past the slight aroma of hypocrisy in your use of the word
"superior" here. There's always a "choice" between competing
"entrants," and there will always be a "chosen" (and a "not
chosen"). As your use of the word "superior" illustrates.

So I don't really see what all the fuss is about. Or, rather, I do,
but not on my better days.

i think that my experience has been that 'cyberspace' made me aware of the
potential and started me looking at what had already been done in the last
century.

i think my experience is a fairly common one. the new medium didn't lead to
discovery but rather to discovery or awakening to potentials.  subtle but

Hughes is being endorsed on the website by the Academy.  This more than
likely explains his prominence in the stamp stakes.

Interesting though to learn of his dissatisfactions with the alphabet.

Illinois & Georgia do this as well, and with web-publicly available guidelines
(which, unless CMU has put them up recently... they don't have).  I associate it
with the trend of journals to charge reading fees or to work only by solicitation
and THEIR contests.

> the fee means the press gets revenue to print the

I think of it as an ad hoc, anonymous collective.  A collective of poets assembles
via mail, with a contribution.  The "leader" anoints the "golden child".  Members
not selected receive a book.

Another problem has been recognized by a number of prizes recently:  the judge and
the series editor (or group of slush readers) often prefer different books.  So
now the prizes have two winners, one blurbed by the judge, chosen from a pool of
finalist ms. and receiving a prize and the "prize winner status", and another
published by the press, ostensibly chosen from the entire pool by those who have
read the entire pool, perhaps with a nominal advance, perhaps not.

It gets confusing because the academic hiring and tenuring system gets mixed in,
and because so many of these are university presses.  This may be why, for
example, it seems ok to pay $10-25 to get the poet version of an audition, which
would be either illegal or inadvisable to any actors or musicians.

It seems now that we've spread this rotten practice to playwrights, and are about
to, with the Zoo Press/Parnassus Prize, to criticism.

yes, cyberspace is making something new - codepoetry, performative work,
work which moves on the page, work which reconfigures the page
dynamically, work which shuts down the machine, work which randomizes text
beyond the reader's control, work which could not have been produced
without programming, code, catalysts, protocols, routers, servers -
ergodic work, in Aarspeth's language, literally performative language or
neutrally performative language (i.e. use of ".echo"), etc. etc. certainly
not to be sought in parataxis or other tropes, but in a direction which
would be impossible without networking, computation, etc. - think also of
WAP mobile-phone work, simultaneous mudding or moing work, collaborative
work involving dynamic elements and dynamic collaborations - the list goes
on and on.

In addition to trashing Hughes, Leonard, which I disagree with completely,
let's remember that Rod McKuen used to hang with the Berkeley Renaissance
poets in the late '40s and early '50s (including Spicer and Duncan). He
might not have been a great poet, but it doesn't mean that he wasn't serious
about it. If you get a sense of a scene that included McKuen, Spicer and
Spicer's old guest on his folk music program on KPFA, Harry Smith, you get a
sense of the feel of the time....

[Trashing poets is just generally not wise behavior. Yeah, I don't like Paul
McCartney's verse -- it seems weaker than Jewel's. Or Henry Rollins. So
what? You can make a good case for the influence of William Carlos Williams
on the work of L. Ron Hubbard, and isn't that Stephen King of all people
quoting Ed Dorn??]

I'm still more amazed at the number of votes that cummings has gotten, given
just how virulent his antisemitism was.

Award Overturned in Abortion Doctor 'Wanted Posters'
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

SAN FRANCISCO, March 28 =8B A federal appeals court threw out a record $109
million verdict against abortion opponents today, ruling that a Web site an=
d
wanted posters that branded abortion doctors "baby butchers" and criminals
were protected by the First Amendment.

A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit here unanimously said the abortion opponents could be held liable
only if the material authorized or directly threatened violence.

The panel ruled two years after a Portland, Ore., jury ordered 12 abortion
opponents to pay damages to Planned Parenthood and four doctors, who had
sued under federal racketeering law and another law against inciting
violence against doctors who perform abortions. The case was seen as a test
of a recent Supreme Court ruling that a threat must be explicit and likely
to cause "imminent lawless action."

"If defendants threatened to commit violent acts, by working alone or with
others," then their works could properly support the verdict, Judge Alex
Kozinski wrote for the appeals court. But if their works "merely encouraged
unrelated terrorists," he said, "then their words are protected by the Firs=
t
Amendment."

Planned Parenthood and the doctors were portrayed in the Old West-style
wanted posters as "baby butchers," and a Web site called the "Nuremberg
Files" listed the names and addresses of abortion providers and declared
them guilty of crimes against humanity.

The abortion opponents said their posters and Web site were protected under
the First Amendment because they were merely a list of doctors and clinics,
not a threat.

Judge Robert Jones of Federal District Court instructed the jury to conside=

the history of violence in the anti-abortion movement, including the
killings of three doctors after their names appeared on the lists.

One was Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was killed by a sniper in 1998.

Doctors who were on the list testified that they lived in constant fear.

The defendants maintained they were political protesters collecting data on
doctors in hopes of one day putting them on trial like Nazi war criminals
were at Nuremberg.

Among the defendants was Michael Bray of Bowie, Md., who went to prison fro=

1985 to 1989 for his role in arson attacks and bombings of seven clinics.

thank you bob


do you think the 'dynamic' devices of poetry on the web, ie
animation software, morphing,  fast hyperlinking, etc, have aided the
proliferation of 'infraverbal' poetry?

i know visual poetry and/or concrete poetry implied motion of words,
but now that we can make words, letters,.syllables, statements  move
about, isn't it developing into a form of its own?

the nonlinear narrative was present before the web but the making
of this kind of writing on-line has seen it develop into a form,
hypertext, which in turn has asked us to look for this kind of thing
in the more traditional literatures.

cheers

Dear All,

I am currently completing a literary biography of Robert Duncan (to be
published by University of California Press) and I need to enlist the
assistance of a couple student interns.

I can't provide financial compensation right now, but I can provide the
following:  free copies of my poetry books, research credit in the
biography, and miscellaneous other poet-like advice, recommendations, etc.

The work includes fact-checking, interview transcribing, and general library
research.

I can be reached at jarnot@pipeline.com or 718-388-4938.

Best,
Lisa Jarnot

I agree, Ron.  But sometimes the bastards are quite talented (Eliot, Pound,
Hemiingway, the Italian Futurists -- and let's not forget that champion of
the downtrodden, Charles Dickens).  Strange that I read and often enjoy these
texts, yet I wouldn't let any one of these authors in my home.  Best, Bill

If any of you listees are in the Santa Cruz area and interested in
(cultural)  poetics and literature, you might be interested in taking part
in this forthcoming event on Sat April 21 organized around the westcoast
extensions of
boundary 2 journal.  All are welcome, breakfast and lunch are provided for
participants and attendees, there is a spectacular view of the Pacific and
maybe the future too.  Rob Wilson (relocated at UC Santa Cruz after 24

WORLDING:  WORLD LITERATURE, FIELD IMAGINARIES, FUTURE PRACTICES
April 21, 2001
College Eight 240, UC Santa Cruz
9:00-6:00

This one-day conference features work in progress by  scholars associated
with the journal boundary 2,  and by local scholars with kindred projects.
Talks will be fifteen minutes each, with ample time for discussion. Lunch
and dinner will be served for presenters and attendees.

boundary 2, an international journal of literature and culture, throughout
the 1990s if not earlier in its push to articulate a critical vision of
postmodernity and globalization, has played a vital role inside the US
humanities in shifting the tired field imaginaries of areas, nations, and
disciplines.  American Studies, Pacific Studies, China Studies, Japan
Studies, Asia Studies, Asia Pacific Studies,  Latin American Studies:  All
have seen their frameworks, power domains, and  terms challenged by
special issues and collective practices of  boundary 2.

The trans-disciplinary pedagogy of World Literature and Cultural Studies
at the University of California at Santa Cruz has worked, in related ways,
to envision exactly what such a global/local, transnational, and
borderlands project could be. Globalization and the vision of the globe do
not belong to any neo-liberal or end of history triumphalism; The world of
world literature is "worlded" from disparate and multiple angles of
vision, frameworks, and practices  as yet emerging.

We gather here to interrogate and push forward the frames of pedagogy and
research,  via this open public dialogue of "work in progress." We welcome
you at  the boundary of transnational field imaginaries and future
practices,  where you cannot just come as you have been or are.

-Rob Wilson Literature at U.C. Santa Cruz, and Advisory Editor of boundary
2.

I doubt that my use of the word "superior"
is hypocritical as I don't think I've ever
claimed not to be an elitist.  The reason I
find poetry contests stupid is that they generally
fail to uncover superior poets by (1) my
standards OR (2) later generations'.

My prescription for doing this would be to
work out a way to make the poetry of all schools
and criticism/discussion of it easy to find,
which the Internet should one day do.
Then aesthcipients can go around judges,
publishers, book-reviewers and all the other
middlemen to what they like.  Equal opportunity
at an audience is what I believe in.

The new issue of VeRT just announced here on Thurs was delayed for more than=
=20
a week due to several thinly veiled threats of lawsuits.  What began=20
initially as a violent reaction against a series of epistolary poems, "Dear=20
Jacques:  Lacan, Miller, Debrot," written by myself in collaboration with=20
Kent Johnson has now devolved into an equally reactionary attempt to coverup=
=20
the poems' ugly reception on the British Poets Listserv where the letters=20
originally appeared.  The final version of the Lacan, however, is now ready=20
for viewing, and includes a link to the Listserv archives so that objective=20
readers can make up their own minds. I am sending below the brief=20
introduction that Andrew Felsinger and Samantha Giles, editors of VeRT, have=
=20
written to the Lacan materials. I think you will have to agree=20
that the manner in which these two young editors have handled this rather=20
complex and thorny affair is quite impressive. And since the publication=20
pertains, in many ways, to the dynamics of listserv politics, I thought=20
Poetics members would wish to see their introductory comments. To view the=20
whole issue #3 (and it is a great issue with loads of good stuff), go to =20
http://www.litvert.com/

While the correspondence between Lacan and Debrot, as it unfolded, caused a=20
few-hundred post angst-meltdown at Brit-Po (indignant charges of pornography=
=20
were frequent), I think you will see that the total
package-- the letters, the two brief contributions by Slavoj Zizek, the=20
fauxed Brit-po postings, and the discussion's actual, empirical record on=20
which the eroticized versions are based-- is provocative and fun and, above=20
all, poetic (though the poesis may not be everyone's cup of tea, to say the=20
least).

thank you, and here is the intro by Andrew and Samantha.

Jacques

----------

Dear Reader(s):

-VeRT has always strived for a quiet uninvolved editorial presence, choosing=
=20
to allow what's published to stand on its own. This was comfortable; indeed,=
=20
we felt it ideal.

However, events of late have compromised this quiet unassuming vision. We=20
have been drawn into somewhat of a maelstrom, regarding the epistolary=20
exchanges: Dear Lacan, which were first posted on the British-Poets=20
ListServe earlier this year. The posts were considered by many on the=20
British-Poets ListServ to be lacking, both in substance and style. A debate=20
ensued on Listserve regarding the work and its creators: Kent Johnson and=20
Jacques Debrot.

We chose, being privy to the posts of this debate, to publish them en masse.=
=20
In so doing, we felt we were acknowledging the fact that they represented a=20
legitimate response to work of such controversial nature. However, we also=20
recognized that they were evocative of what we in the experimental poetry=20
community confront often: a conservative misunderstanding of work that=20
attempts to not only push the proverbial envelope, but to transgress it.

We also believed that the poets quoted therein would stand behind their=20
remarks in total. We were, unfortunately, na=EFve in this assumption. After=20
the publication of these posts, we received a litany of angry demands for=20
retractions and apologies. To some extent these demands were not without=20
merit. The posts had, indeed, been edited-- though not materially changed.=20
Upon learning of this fact, we chose to remove the link to these posts, and=20
assess the situation.

Certainly we at -VeRT don't want to take ourselves too seriously. In some=20
sense, such seriousness hinders what we see as our project. Despite this,=20
this controversy has forced us to make real, serious editorial decisions. We=
=20
choose the following course of action and are publishing:

1. The Lacan Posts: Dear Jacques et al as originally published.
2. A URL link to the full text of the British ListServe response to the=20
Lacan text.
3. At her request, an edited and complete post from one of the participants=20
of the British ListServ, Allison Croggon
4. An edited, adulterated and poetic response to these posts written by one=20
of the Lacan contributors, Jacques Debrot, along with an Introduction by=20
Slavoj Zizek.
5. Lastly, a thoughtful, unedited response to this whole mess, provided by=20
Steve Duffy, also a participant on the British ListServ.

So there it is. We hope that in the end these choices reflect the certain=20
quietude that we have wanted to maintain, but also beg the question: Whose=20
work is it anyway?

Respectfully,
Your Loving Editors

A collection of Tamura Ryuichi's poetry has been
published in English translation by CCC Books.

Information is available at the web site:

http://www.home.earthlink.net/~cccbooks/tamura/

Tamura died in 1998, and with his death, his publisher
announced, Japan's post war poetry has come to and
end.

The above collection of his poetry in translation
includes 149 poems, numerous photographs, as well as
copies of original manuscripts.

I would appreciate very greatly if you could add this
listing to your site.

Thank you,


Sam Grolmes

Perhaps you have free tuition reimbursement, or know someone who would
want to sign up for my workshop.   Perhaps you want to participate in an
online poetry workshop yourself.

You would go to http://www.uclaextension.org, and then, frankly, the
fastest way is to quick search by registration number, K6658U, on the
lower right hand portion of the screen.  Alternately, you can go to
http://www.onlinelearning.net, click course catalog, and search for
"poetry workshop".  When I went through to see the easiest way to get to
the course description and enroll, I found that neither UCLA Extension
nor onlinelearning.net had linked directly to the course.

It will be a 10 week workshop, online.  I will provide links and
readings in realism, from Nelson Algren through Lyn Hejinian, but this
is really a poetry workshop, not a literature class or a practicum.

Participants are -- sweeping generalization -- adults with a BA in
English.

Thanks,
Catherine Daly

Two self-serving annoucements:

1)  May I please direct your attention to the new issue of Rain Taxi,
available in independent bookstores nationwide and online at raintaxi.com
(but the new issue isn't online yet as of this writing)?  It includes an
interview I did with the wonderful poets Michael Burkard and Diane Wald
and my review of Chris Tysh's Continuity Girl, but also reviews of Lisa
Jarnot's new book, Lyn Heijinian's new book, a great comic by Gary
Sullivan, a piece by David Foster Wallace on the Prose Poem anthology
that made me really mad and other stuff of interest to listees.

2)  I just found out I will be reading for the launch party of the new
issue of Lit, the journal of the New School's MFA program, on Friday, May
4, at the New School's Wollman Hall on the 5th floor at 7 PM.  I will be
reading with Wayne Koestenbaum and Therese Svoboda.  There will be a dj.
This is my first (invited) reading in NYC, and I'm pretty damn excited to
be reading with such hot shots.  I hope all of you NYC people I never get
to see can come!

Best,
Arielle

My opinion of McKuen went way up when I heard some of his funny beatnik
recordings---for instance I didn't know that Richard Hell's "Blank Generation"
stole the melody from a McKuen thing called "I Belong To The Beat Generation,"
and my respect for Terry jacks went up when I realized he was the
songwriter/guitarist for The Poppy Family....

I was in Portland, walking over golf courses on acid, resenting T. S.
Eliot.
     from _Eleanor Ramsey, The Queen of Cups_

Elizabeth Treadwell lives in Berkeley, California, where she edits and
publishes the literary journal _Outlet_ and the Double Lucy chapbook
series.  She is also the Director of Small Press Traffic in San Francisco.
She is the author of a novel, _Eleanor Ramsey: The Queen of Cups_, and a
collection of prose/poetry, _Populace_, as well as five chapbooks,
including the recent _Eve Doe: Prior to Landscape_.  Her most recent work,
_Acts_, was a finalist in the National Poetry Series and for the Alberta
Prize in 2000.  Currently she is completing a new collection of poems
entitled _Gardenia_.  Susan Smith Nash writes that "with voices of joy,
triumph, camaraderie, and anarchy, Elizabeth Treadwell's utopian democracy
opens up a new door into the overlooked corners of our world--a world in
which women have dignity, humor, and aplomb, and where the disenfranchised
have intelligence and spunk.  Her use of language is nothing short of
heart-stopping ..."

A Portrait of Daniel:
I think of a river
running through you.
It flows from your head
to your upper
thighs and groin.  The
river surrounds your
head but you are not
drowning.  Inside you
there are rocks, and
the water crashes
against them.
     from _Georgette's Revenge_

For more than 12 years, Christy Sheffield Sanford has fused the genres of
poetry, fiction, and biography.  Her pioneering and extraordinary Web work
has earned her numerous honors and awards, including The Well's prize for
the Best Hyperlinked Work on the Web for "NoPink," and an Alden B. Dow
Creativity Centre Fellowship.  She was also the first trAce Virtual
Writer-in-Residence.  Her many works on the internet include _RED MONA_,
_Georgette's Revenge_, and _The H's: The Spasm of a Requiem_.  Among her
seven books are _Library of Congress_, _Sur Les Pointes_, _Bride Thrashing
Through History_, and _Only the Nude Can Redeem the Landscape_.  According
to Frederick Barthelme of _The Atlantic Online_, she is one of the few
poet-artists who is "working at the edges and genuinely changing the
definition of literary art."

he said that an M could be used in its place, and the readers could flip the book upside

You dont know what I'm getting at! I dont know myself. But there is this:
there are still a huge number of people out there who think that a poem
should "tell a story" so to speak. They want everything vividly clear so
(I'm thinking of a poet I know) that they can write about "pain" or an
infinite number of "deep" subjects. Nothing perhaps wrong so far. But in the
person's case it turns out of be a long moan about (their) life. A litany
that is
selfish (in the worst sense - instead of being self reliant or self -centred
in a healthy positive sense). I'm not thus jumping to critique the
"confessional" poets, they did some great stuff, but a kind of writing that
is for me tediously linear. The kind of stuff that is referrred to as New
Yorker poetry (altho that maybe unfair on those published there). Auden in
his later poetry veered toward the sort of thing and the language poets and
poets like Alan Sondheim or even some of the better "mainstream" poets are
all condemned. With people who want this kind of "logical" poetry Eliot and
Pound or any one after Alexander Pope are dangerous radicals or they are
playing a trick. Stewart and McCauley (of Australia) were of that kind. They
were "hoist with their own petard" when  they tried to attack "modernism" by
inventing Ern Malley. What's the book? I have it here..."The Ern Malley
Affair" I think it is...the major literary hoax of the 20th but (they made
up the Ern Malley poems in an afternoon from army manuals, scraps of Eliot,
and various other things from their imagination or memory or old magazines
and references) They invented Ern Malley...but the
poems submitted may have been the best things either of them ever wrote!!
Probably
because they wernt thinking too hard about what they were going to write
next. Having fun, clowning around, and out to fool a lit mag of the time
"The Angry Penguins" (it was about 1943) they were thus operating in the
mode of "negative capability" or whatever process you want to call it. They
didnt totally fool Max Harris, the editor, who "smelt a rat" but published
the poems that seemed to come from his sister who had discovered them after
her brother's death. I've got the book now and its by  Michael Heyward.
Fascinating. So, somwhat by default, they wrote the most interesting poetry
(given the circumstances) possibly Australia has ever produced. Not the
best,of course,  but the most interesting...and fragments of it are
brilliant. Another comical (nearly tragic) aspect is that after Harris had
published the poems he became acceleratingly frantic searching for hard
evidence of the author. McCauley and Stewart had anticipated postmodernism!
  What is alarming is the venom of Stewart and McCauley. they HATED
modernism. They hated Eliot and Herbert Read. They were very right wing.
They wanted traditional poetry in a "poetic" mode. They wanted clarity and
linearity and logic and "beauty" etc They didn't want modernism or any
innovation. They didnt want "confusion".
  They wernt really poets: they were dullards..albeit very sharp dullards...
  There are editors and writers in great abundance who still think like
that.
   But, that digression aside, and immersed in my "ambiguous undulations" I
shall leave off before I confuse myself and others further. Before I begin
talking about "the fifth curve"....ah, the fifth curve...Regards, Richard.

But Bill, of course you wouldnt, their all dead! Maybe Cummings got lots of
votes because most people are thick and think a bit like Jason in "The Sound
and the Fury" or they like soppy pretty pretty crap like McKuen pumps out.
Lets face it musicians usually have atrocious taste when it comes to poetry.
Most pop songs are crap including the Beatles. Its sad but there's a lot of
weak lit around. But most people are as my father used to say "morons". Who
put the mock in democracy? Nihil bastardum carborundum, Richard.

Embarrassment of Survival: Selected Poems, 1970-1999 by Paul Vangelisti
edited and introduced by Standard Schaefer

Following in the international avant-garde traditions that have most
influenced him, this noted translator, editor and journalist has
published some 20 books of poetry. Remarkable and often relentless
formal experiments on the long poem, much of this work has been
incompatible with the constraints of mainstream poetry publishing. As a
result, these book length poems have intimidated or been rendered
invisible to the American audience. Their influence on Californian
writing, on the West Coast avant-garde and poetry in Los Angeles, in
particular, has been prevalent since the 1970s.
 In this edition, the vast array of sustained formal experiments and
comic delirium have been arranged to reveal the singularity of
Vangelisti's particular inquiries into dislocation, exile, corruption
and the illusions of the inner life. Using such forms as the
novel-in-verse, collage, visual poetry, and Oulipean alphabet poems,
among several others, Vangelisti's books represent one of the most
rigorous inquiries by an American into the essential poetic question: Is
poetry nothing more than the language of failure? Always sensitive to
struggle and loss, his response echoes that of all people for whom there
has been nothing to lose but life itself. Arranged chronologically,
this selection marks the progression of his humorous and acute
investigation into what can be done.
  Publication date: April 1, 2001. Marsilio/Agincourt. 312 pages,
$14.95.

I utterly agree with Ron's defense of Mister McKuen. What's wrong with
beachcombing and fireside swoons? Pleasures subtle, real and merciful. Plus,
he manages the sort of omniscient voice-over pageantry that can make
something like "The Love Movement" or "The Black Hawk, a Gothic Musical"
work. Since the English stole Scott Engel from us and made him a Walker, Rod
is the closest thing we have to a Jacques Brel. After a few spins of his
records, the corn pops and suddenly your behind the music. That's the
sweetest sort of conversion one can make!

And Smith, Spicer and McKuen...can you think of a sexier cabal?

But, to rehearse an old debate, I really can't stand for this McCartney
slapping. He was clearly the most tuneful Beatle, zany or no. "Maybe I 'm
Amazed" is a heartbreaker, and "Jet" is at least as delirious as any
Elmsliean banana peel shuffle. But I may be alone in this, and I thought the
only lonely place was on the moon...

Best all,
Andrew

::: COME AS YOU ARE (WITH SOMETHING A LITTLE EXTRA) :::

The Segue Foundation and Double Happiness present on Saturday, April 7th at
4 pm a poetry reading by Bruce Andrews and Jacques Debrot.

BRUCE ANDREWS, one of the founding editors of the journal L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
from which Language poetry got its name and long one of New York's prime
avant-goers, is the author of several landmark books including Given Em
Enough Rope [1987], I Don't Have Any Paper So Shut Up (Or, Social
Romanticism) [1992] and Paradise & Method: Poetics and Praxis [1996], a
collection of essays.

JACQUES DEBROT is the author of Confuzion Comix (Second Story Books), and is
the editor of the zine 9 to 0. Known as one of the more challenging
from-the-hip literary provocateurs, he has published poems in Combo, an
infamous hologram interview with John Ashbery on Readme
(www.jps.net/nada/issuefour.htm), and a suite of visual "illiteracy" poems
in honor of Poetry Fool's Month at www.arras.net.

::: PLUS :::

This poetry reading will double as a book party event for the publication of
Andrews' LIP SERVICE, just out from Coach House Press.  Copies of the volume
will be on sale at a generous "budget surplus saving" discount at the
reading.

The Adman say:
LIP SERVICE, the long-awaited long poem sequel to SHUT UP, reminds us to
"accept no discourse except love's."

Bruce Andrews on LIP SERVICE:
"LIP SERVICE is my recasting of Dante's PARADISO. Its 'christmases of the
heart in syllables' take Dante's thematic cues & path through ten concentric
planetary bodies to rechoreograph several years' worth of poetic raw
material of mine Ñ on love, erotic intimacy, gender socialization & the
body. Dante's topics & tercets & punctuation gives its 100 parts their
internal shape, with a drastic constructivism of syntax, with detonations &
fluidities magnetizing its word-to-word attractions or pushes & pulls as
'valedictory honeymoon burns in the pagination.'" The book is 380 pages,
gorgeous, and my major work from the last decade.

:::

Double Happiness is located at 173 Mott Street, just south of Broome; it is
down some stairs, and doesn't have a storefront.  The readings are held
during DH's happy hour -- two fer one drinks, enuf to make me and my "autre"
happy.

Right on, Ron.  Hughes doesn't deserve the trashing and; while I'm no fan of
McKuen or King, McCartney's sugar makes me tweak and twitch without Lennon's
salt, Jewel...looks great, and I can't understand why such a highly
successful businessman as Mr. Rollins could still be so damn angry about
everything, I'm always suspicious when these most obvious of goats get
scaped.

I greatly prefer the company of the Good Doctor, the Gunslinger and the
Alchemist, as well as Spicer and Duncan, to that bunch but, honestly, I only
know McKuen as a punch line and wonder how his work stands up to that of his
mockers.

Since I've already revealed my questionable taste by suggesting a beer
flavored stamp with the mug of Bukowski, think I'll take this opportunity to
redeem myself: Zukofsky, anyone?  Berryman?  Has Stein been stamped?

I'm sorry but I must disallow McKuen and or the Beatles or anyone named
Smith from this discussion. Or any one else of a "popular" ilk. Or I'll fire
them and all you lot out of my canon. Yours,Richard von Harold

    haven't really been following this--who is counting the votes? and
putting on this competition?--

    has anyone thought of Kenneth Patchen, d.a. levy, Lorine Niedecker, Lord
Buckley, Robert Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson, Tupac Shakur, George Oppen,
Lew Welch, Slim Gaillard, Stephen Jonas--
    Larry Eigner I hope, for sure--

    Rod McKuen bashing seems kind  of sad--an easy target--
    (last I heard of him years ago--was on the road looking for his father--)

    Bashing--when John Lennon was in his brandy swilling club hopping NYC
days when life with Yoko was tenuous--he was at a club at same time as Jerry
Lee Lewis--
    Lennon boozily approached The Killer, knelt at his feet--and bent over to
kiss his foot--
    Jerry Lee kicked him in the face.
    After all, the first record sent to the moon in a time capsule was by
Jerry Lee--"Great Balls of Fire"--

Contributions Needed:

To publish Collected Works by Ed Cox, late Washington D.C. area
poet/editor/teacher. The volume will collect Ed's previous books, Waking
and Blocks, a s.s., plus his unpublished mss. Part Of. Every $25 donation
reserves a copy of the book for the contributor. Make checks out to
Richard Peabody, 3819 No. 13th St., Arlington, VA 22201. Or e-mail
hedgehog2@erols.com for more information.

Please Spread the Word. I'm helping Ed's sister Laura, and her husband
Bob, put this project together. There will be a publication launch where
friends will get to read their fave Ed Cox poem or tell a pithy anecdote
or whatever.  We hope to have the book out by the Fall of 2001.

That's the gist. Just trying to make it happen.

greetings from miyazaki,

I didn't know about the site, so just checked it out. Went straight
to the Langston Hughes page, to see how it was handled. Wow - What a
gold mine! Thanks for the pointer.

I used his anthology for a semester and provided links on my online
syllabus to the companion site.  For students using the anthology,
I've found that the author pages provide extra "umph" and commentary
that isn't allowed in the anthology proper; motivated students used
the site to hone their introductory research efforts.  The site is
less effective as a stand-alone resource, but i don't think it really
claims to be one.  Nelson mentions in his introduction that he didn't
have room in his anthology to treat the American song tradition; I
think he misses an opportunity to treat it on the companion site.
But in general the anthology and site work well together.

Is this a joke?  (And no, I don't mean the part about your correspondence
with Jacques Lacan).

Although, as one of the contributors to -VeRT #3, I have no problem with
anyone doing what they can to call attention to it, when I go to the site I
find neither the introduction Jacques quotes nor the link to the Britpo
archives.

Just wondering,

"Meditations on Jenny kissed"


Jenny kissed me,
only once,
he said to me,
Now she's gone.

How do I go on?
Every day I wait
remembering that once
my Jenny kissed me
and as she was leaving said,
now I'm going, now I'm gone.

Only once and never more
timidly my Jenny kissed me
touched my lips before goodbye.
Every day I wait and wonder

If life and
love has not missed me
only to pass on, pass on.
Valentines are sent to others
everyone but me.

Yet I never miss the heart card,
oh no, Jenny kissed me
untied my heart and set it free.

Thank you for bringing this poem to my inbox. I saw the hawks circling so I
felt informed ... MY GOD this is a fine poem. The tenderness, immediacy, the
lack of irony. A beautiful expression. Its not as hip as I desire but a
beautify vocal expression and we should listen, maybe not follow, but
listen.

As I recall, Charles Plymell published a review--early 70s?--in which he
quite earnestly compared McKuen with a handful of then-popular
mainstream poets, and found McKuen more interesting (or less heinous)
than the rest. I'll confess that it didn't move me to become a reader of
R.M., but it certainly was a refreshing dose of antidoxy (scoliodoxy?).

The poem/song may be pretty, it would make a good song, with the right
music: but as poetry this doesnt put McKuen anywhere. He's simply like
millions of other rather weak sentimental poets (or are they frauds?) who
write basically because their formula works. They are "straight from the
heart poets". Unfortunately, the heart, (compared to the mind/brain...altho
admittedly associated with that) is infinitely LESS interesting and LESS
complex than the mind/brain. Creeley's poems have a very subtly wrought
cadence and timing as well as an informed intelligence. He makes leaps of
thought that McKuen simply doesnt make. I'd have to say that he's simply not
challenging enough for me: unkindly I could say I feel that he writes crap.
Compared to the Langpos (with all the flak they've been receiving.... of
course they should be critiqued)..but they are infinitely more interesting
than Rod McKuen. He's a kind of Mills and Boon of poetry. Poetry IS a high
art and people on the list should ignore trivia. Or at least understand how
McKuen "fits in". Its not enough to say he associated with Spicer. A lot of
major poets associate withh "lesser" poets.
 It might be felt that I'm "elitist". O.k. I can see how popular culture
fits in but ..I think that McKuen wouldnt think of himself as a poet of the
power say of Walace Stevens, Ashbery or any of the "names". His work is
valid and excellent for what he is doing and its good that some people
(obviously a lot) love it. And good on him for his success. But we as ...
how should I say..more literate or informed writers and readers should be
pushing (well not me  for the stamp as I'm not American) but certainly
pushing for what we all more or less concur are "major" writers. I know that
that can lead to the great canon Debate.
  As far as that goes I can be quite a cunning little relatavist: I dispute
a set canon but somewhow feel we need to at least teach some (perhaps an
arbitrary selection ) of core "Great Books", but we'd need to be open to the
idea that it IS difficult (in the wider debate to exclude McKuens etc)..and
I know how problematic that is. But for now, I think we have to be honest
and apply a bit of literary or poetic nouse and either "trash" McKuen (but
not the person) or explain our difficulties with him. McKuen is a
singer/somgwriter type and vast numbers of their ilk miss the boat for me as
far as being exciting or interesting or even "beautiful" or just wonderful
poets. He's an "ooh" and an "ahh!!" and an "oh how loveley lovley goo goo
poet"  I'm afraid. Has his place, but...well.. that's my position. America
(and indeed the whole world) has produced thousands of extremely interesting
and significant poets. But the US is still the "fount" of major innovation:
sure the centre is shifting but it will always compete .. but you dont need
Rod McKuens. Bukowski and Zukofsky (obviously very different but both
brilliant in their own ways) but save me from McKuen!! Richard Taylor.

Hi, I'm teaching an online poetry workshop this summer through Syracuse
University and want to order an anthology for the students to use.  I'd
like to support a small press, and I'm also looking for an anthology with
a wide variety of contemporary work and styles that would not be
intimidating for beginning poets.  I have a number of anthologies at
home, of course, but I'm wondering if there are any suggestions from
people who've successfully used anthologies in such classes in the past?

Backchannel would be great.

Thanks,
Arielle

Papa,
Don't bother. E-mail petitions are useless. To find someone who explains it better than me, go to http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/petition/brazil.htm.

It's not true anyway, just so you know...
