Should've picked up on this before (has someone already mentioned it?), but
there were two interesting papers on JR at the recent New Hampshire
conference, (where she also read, wonderfully) -- Burton Hatlen 'Joan
Retallack, a philosopher among the poets, a poet among the philosophers'
and Alan Devenish, 'Living with the mess: Joan Retallack's "poethical
wager"'. Perhaps these are already mounted at the EPC? Or will be published
in the proceedings? (Check with Loss Glazier or Romana Huk.)

Subject:      Kellogg's Mantle

The quick help on La Curandera made me feel it was perhaps time to respond
to David Kellogg's oft-repeated plaint that his fireplace lacks an adjust-
able shelf. He borrows words from Thomas Kinsella to say it: There is no
mantle/and it does not descend.    David, if you see it as a long bosuns
chair, the construction is pretty straightforward. Take a 2x8 or 2x10,
drill two holes at each end, run lines crossing diagonally under the plank,
& tie them together a couple of feet above it (though eye-splices give a
more elegant appearance). Attach a single-sheave block to the ceiling, clip
(or tie with a bowline) a halyard to the shelf lines, haul it up to what-
ever height you like, and tie it off to a cleat on the wall next to the
fireplace. If you don't like the halyard crossing the space behind the
mantle, you'll need a second block to act as a fairlead--then you can run
the halyard along the ceiling to wherever you like--even right to your
armchair, if you bolt a cleat to the side. You can adjust it rise-descend
without even getting up. But remember, some people don't even have
fireplaces.  best, Sylvester

        And here I've thought all along that it was Mickey's Mantle that
does not descend now that Mickey Mantle has ascended to the Hall of Fame
in the Sky.
        As Casey Stengel was wont to say:  "You could look it UP."

now, this is an area in which i've experienced some confusion of late, don't ask
me why it seems to have come up fairly frequently in the last several months:
isn't the fireplace thing spelled "mantel," whereas the garment thing is spelled
"mantle"?

The poetry slam is actually named in memory of a grand slam that Marc
Smith saw Ernie Banks hit.  Even so,
there seem to be
some pretty obvious connections that one could draw between the two.

Aren't those predictable 'failures of communication' actually the sites of
artistic negotiation? Isn't it pleasant to sit here watching the clouds go
by while monopoly capitalism extinguishes itself through a bland
hierarchical arson? While Bob Dylan sings? While another one steps up to

The garment thing is, to my knowledge, always "mantle", but the fireplace
thing can be either "mantel" or "mantle."

Pierre asks the exact date of composition of Charles Olson's PLAN FOR A
CURRICULUM OF THE SOUL. I checked with Ralph Maud, who came up with a
letter from Olson to George Butterick, dated 26 February 1968, re/ the
publication of the "Plan" in THE MAGAZINE OF FURTHER STUDIES. Olson
writes:

"Just for the accuracy, please change word "drugs" in first line of "Plan
for a Curriculum of the Soul" to "the mushroom. . . ."

The "Plan" was published in THE MAGAZINE OF FURTHER STUDIES, No. 5, July
1968. Ralph reckons that Olson wrote it expressly for the magazine early
in 1968, probably February.  The letter can be found in the Don Allen
file at the Archive for New Poetry, UC San Diego.

Cheers,

Subject: Immigration Update

USSA
Immigration Update
October 1, 1996

The immigration bill (H.R. 2202) that passed the House last week was most
recently attached to the FY97 CR/Omnibus bill.  The CR was passed
yesterday by the Senate and signed last night by President Clinton.
While some of the most reprehensible provisions of the immigration
legislation were removed prior to Senate and Administration approval, the
bill remains a mean-spirited document which penalizes undocumented
persons and makes it more difficult for legal immigrants and U.S.
citizens to reunite with their families.

Provisions which were removed prior to passage:
% Deeming a sponsor's income as available to a legal immigrant student
who applied for federal financial aid
% Gallegly Amendment, which would have denied public education to
undocumented children
% Deportation of immigrants who received public benefits for 12 months
(including students who received grant aid)
% Denial of certain public benefits to legal immigrants (although most
legal immigrants remain ineligible for many public assistance programs
under the welfare legislation signed into law by Clinton in August)
% Denial to legal immigrants of access to treatment for HIV

Provisions which remain in the bill:
% Establishment of pilot program for collecting information about
non-immigrant students to ensure that such student do not overstay their
visas.  The program would require entering foreign students to pay a fee
of up to $100 to support the program
% Requirement that sponsors of immigrant relatives earn at least 125% of
the poverty level
% One year time limit for applying for political asylum
% Denial of certain due process measures to persons who arrive without
documents, including political asylees
% Establishment of employee verification program (with a 27% possibility
of error!) in five states with high populations of undocumented persons
so that employers can check legal status of prospective employees
% Increased burden of proof for prospective employees claiming hiring
discrimination based on immigration status.  Such persons will need to
show an "intent" to discriminate, a nearly impossible standard
% Increased border control, including 1000 new agents by 2001 and $12
million for a new border fence and other measures

Students should register their complaints about the immigration
legislation with both their Representatives and Senators as well as with
the Administration and should indicate that part of the student agenda
for the upcoming year will be to work to reform this oppressive and
discriminatory bill.

Topic No. 2

Yesterday, both Congress and the President approved a 1997 Pentagon
budget of $244 billion, $9.4 billion more than the military wanted,
while claiming to be concerned about "balancing the budget!"

We invite you to join an e-mail discussion for campus activists
interesting in challenging this hypocracy, and the military/prison
priorities of our society in general. The list is called called
CAN-PEACE (Campus Activists' Network, Peace Activism) and already
there are about 150 subscribers.

In 1996-7 CAN-PEACE will provide communication for campus activists
participating in a national campaign and speaking tour to question
the justification for federal priorities in which 52 cents of every
tax dollar is used by the military.

To expose the underlying ideology behind this madness, we are calling
this campaign "Challenge the Lie$.  We also offer resources to help
make this campaign a participatory activity, open to anyone concerned
about our society and willing to challenge the climate of fear and
cynicism that enables military and prison contractors to continue
robbing us blind.  Several national groups, listed below, have agreed
to provide information and support.

This discussion is cosponsored by national Peace Action and its
new Student Peace Action Network, and facilitated by Brad Van
Guilder of Stockton State College (fac193@pollux.stockton.edu).

LIE #2:

"The U.S. Constitution prevents us from spending our tax dollars on social
programs."


WHAT'S THE TRUTH?

Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution reads: " The Congress shall have
power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the
debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United
States"

The Constitution does not prevent investments in our social welfare.

What prevents these investments is a Congress controlled by the weapons
industry!

Yeah? Well, the umpires sure shafted the Texas pitchers in the second game.
AND Raines was not safe at first! I will never forgive. Never.

        Thanks again to Gabrielle Welford for the posts concerning the
Immigration Laws.

        Actually the privileged cultural moment wasn't Dylan quote--but
if you scroll down past that, is a post re conference to be held on
Chance in Las Vegas (where else?) featuring Baudrillard, Diane di Prima,
Tom Watson, et al.
        Too bad Pascal the Wagerer can't be there!

orion was looking good at a mad alex reading last week.  walked around
talking about stephen paul miller and presence.  was stephen paul miller
really his own presence?  or was his presence just a bourgeois rhetorical
tactic to gain attention? sorry i'm paraphrasing.

Bill

ps, how do you verify an orion sighting that is written down? please instruct
me how to read.

billi remember you saying orion saying something more like is stephen paul
miller an ironic stance adopted as a parody by a more intelligent being, or
is stephen paul miller merely the victim of his own bourgeous rhetorical
stance? (another paraphrase but gives the idea i came away with.)

to answer the question of how you spot orion words---he puts copies of
his poems on mail boxes & lamp posts in the east village--Jordan collects
them--I think hw should publish them--urge him to type a few for our
edification--i think orion is brillian--but he smells bad.

i may have missed the start of this thread: are you referring to Orion
Feig?

BTW, just now heard from stephen-paul miller in Krakow, who is
settling in there for a while on a fullbright. if you or someone
wants his email address, let me know.
he says he'd love to write something for some publication about
the polish scene and poetry etc.

Subject:      Re: orion

None other than Orion Feig, who is currently describing Steven Spielberg
and Hal Sirowitz in the magic-marker notes he tapes to street signs and
phone booths in the East Village. These notes seem very much the product of
a schizophrenic imagination (a lot of parsing out the meaning of words by
means of folk etymology, a lot of free-floating and then very pointed
hostility). As I say, his latest motif is 'the nasal crutch', the meaning
of which I prefer not to know. Joel Lewis knows more about Orion than I do,
probably many of you know Orion. He spends most of his time in Tompkins
Square Park. I don't know where he sleeps. I'm told he goes south for the
winter. Kenny Goldsmith has some of Orion's writings up on his website.
Kenny?

Subject:      Geneva Sound Poetry Events

I'm sorry I'm so late with this, but here's a brief summary of the "festival de
la Batie" sound poetry events I said I'd post, which were held in Geneva,
Switzerland on September 13th, 14th and 15th.

It was a very enjoyable festival.  There was a nice mix of work, performed text,
recording-enhanced material, theatrical/linguistic and looser happening-style
performance.  The entire "festival de la Batie" was very well organized and
publicized, with posters, catalogs, all over Geneva and also in neighboring
France.

Roger Lewinter held a conference/reading on Mallarme on the 13th.  I heard part
of it in rehearsal, but missed the performance, so I can't say much more.  I
heard, though, that Mallarme devotees enjoyed it.

The performances of September 14th were quite memorable.  The highlight, I
thought, was Bernard Heidsieck who gave what was probably the most complete
literary performance I've ever seen.  As Mark McMorris said, it's surprising
Heidsieck isn't better known in the U.S.  He has an elegance and presence in
performance that's quite rare.

Amanda Stewart performed some very nice pieces, technically accomplished and
varied in an almost classic sound poetry style, with a lot of phonemic emphasis
and speed.  Some of her pieces had a more textual base and displayed a more
writerly character, which made for an interesting contrast.

Guenther Ruch and Juergen Olbrich performed an action based piece with
interaction via phone and fax.  They placed phone calls to designated
participants, which were broadcast to the audience, received faxes throughout
the performance, and performed a variety of sound actions involving velcro, the
hammering of spaghetti, the destruction of a cuckoo clock, etc.  Their piece had
some very curious and successful moments.

The performances of the 15th were also quite varied.  The evening started off
with Christian Uetz.  He performed most of his pieces in High German, with
sections in Swiss German dialect, a few pieces in French and then also a few in
German, French and English, all it seemed from memory.  His work was very
athletic with a lot of twist and speed.  It seemed to work especially well in
German.

Mark McMorris and I performed second.  Our piece "Accompong" combined elements
of the languages of the Jamaican Maroons, along with the use of various large
three-dimensional letter-rubrics that had been constructed out of steel and
wood.  The performance joined action to voice to rubric: interacting with the
letters, rocking them, carrying them, hitting them, and so on, while speaking,
reading, or shouting.  Mark's performance of the Nyankopong section of the
piece, which Mark performed while balancing a 90 pound steel "M", his head in
the "V" of the "M" on a waist-high wooden "H", was mysterious and beautiful.

Julie Patton's performance was very well received.  A lot of people enjoyed her
blusey, jazzy rhythms and it was a pleasant reminder to have music so strongly
allied with speech rhythms.  The pieces that emphasized her voice were very
nice, especially the passages which had speech moving in and out of song.

Bob Cobbing and Hugh Metcalfe rounded out the evening with a sound performance
extravaganza.  They were wonderfully wild, brilliant, awful, funny, wise,
stupid, scary, and best of all comfortable and at ease.  Bob Cobbing's singing
is a wonder.  It's difficult to know exactly where it comes from, but then it's
there, and it's wonderful; no words, just grumbly sounds, with drums, bells and
other instrumentation mixed in.  Hugh Metcafle's musical improvisations were
perfect accompaniment.

There is a remarkable co-written novel on line by Margueritte and Orion.
Each swaps turns at writing and Orion's style is particularly astounding:

http://www.thecurrent.com/newworld/harvey.htm


Don't Call Me Harvey
by Margueritte and Orion


This is the true story of Orion, a poet in his forties experiencing a full
blown schizophrenic illness while living outdoors in the famous Tompkins
Square Park of New York City, and Margueritte, a poet in her fifties who is
a psychiatric
nurse. The title, DON'T CALL ME HARVEY is from a joke of theirs that
developed from one of Orion's delusions, that Margueritte was really Lee
Harvey Oswald.

Subject:      The New Norton

I don't know if this is an old thread (haven't had much time for
lurking/reading lately), but has anyone had a look at the new (4th
edition) Norton Anthology of Poetry?  It's just about to hit the
bookstores.

I got a glimpse at it last night.  Pre-20th century looks like a big
improvement; 20th century very discouraging.  Stein (from "Stanzas in
Meditation") and Riding are now included, but the post-1950 selection is
pretty horrific.  A couple of Michael Palmer poems, but no Susan Howe, Lyn
Hejinian, Charles Bernstein, etc., etc.  Maybe the thinking was that Paul
Hoover's Pomo. Norton had covered such "minority" interests, but please,
Brad Leithauser?!

And my particular pet peeve: STILL NO OPPEN.

i always hate these "drivel by my standards!" kinds of messages about poems
that are, by general measures of these things, good quality.  it has such
a sour, preening tone...

the heaney is, as any heaney poem is, at the very least a solid poem.  i
don't happen to think it is his best, and i can think, easily, of poems by
him i like better ("Mid-Term Break" springs immediately to mind).  the poem
by Wislawa Szymborska was, i thought, wonderful -- a sort of quick,

I think they're both bad poems by any standard but
the most academic notions of poetry. Further the poems
reproduced by Szymborska in the NY TIMES and LA Times
were equally, to my thinking, mediocre.

Subject:      Heidsieck before Heaney

Multiple comments here:

Ward,

Okay, I'll bite (munch):
"The highlight, I thought, was Bernard Heidsieck who gave what was
probably the most complete literary performance I've ever seen.  As
Mark McMorris said, it's surprising Heidsieck isn't better known in the
U.S.  He has an elegance and presence in performance that's quite
rare."

I agree with you that he should be much more well known, but I'd love
to know what about his performance made it "the most complete
literary...." Don't just tease us. We want the facts, the details, the
nuances.

Regarding Szymborska and Heaney:
I've seen some of her poems in translations that made me think that
there might be something there, as well as ones that look like the
worst of Anne Sexton (which is sort of how I took the one posted here).
I think it's difficult to make the kind of sweeping "drivel" judgment
across languages unless one has a lot of evidence. After all, there are
dozens of dreadful Lorca translations and mushy translations of
Baudelaire abound. I try to imagine how hard it must be translate
certain American and Canadian poets (Rae Armantrout's poems, for
example, are so taught and yet fully coded in a particular idiom that
one would have to either jettison a world of nuance [precisely what
gives her poems their remarkable depth] or else puff them out the way
popped corn kernals are, which might end up looking like some of
Szymborska's poems.

Heaney on the other hand might be an argument for recognition of
different modes of English as different languages, but... reading works
like the one below (and I've found this sort of stuff in every piece of
his I've ever read), I cannot imagine the self respecting poet who
would not simply cringe at that "cuckoo your name" line, which happens
to be the hinge of this whole hoary construction. Beyond that, he's
simply putting the pathetic back into its fallacy, no?

The idea that this is "solid" is like suggesting that a redwood burl
coffee table is great sculpture (or "solid" sculpture). It's perhaps
tighter than some of the conservative bad poems (as distinct from the
conservative good ones, which frankly there are plenty of) out there,
but it definitely depends on thinking that that old conceit is reason
enough to write a poem and that the word "mossy" is in itself a
sufficient revelation to ground its clanging sense of closure. What
makes this "award winning" is a study in the social pathology of
reading in our time, rather than a study in literature, no?

Subject:      Messerli returing to Szymbroska

Dear Ron,

You're quite right about the comments you made about=20
translation. It is hard to truly evaluate a poet on the
basis of translation, although I do think--particularly
with a good translation (which this may not be)--one can
get a fair sense of the work, and in some (few) cases it can
actually make the work seem MORE interesting. Perhaps the=20
excellence of Swedish translation of Szymborska's work=20
accounts for the award--although the Nobel committee has
certainly made some atrocious choices in literature
over the last decade.

I was, of course, being intentionally provocative yesterday,
for several reasons. At times there seems to be a kind of
unstated notion on the list, a kind
a passive notion that all poetry is the same, and=20
no distinctions need be made, that we should never talk
about the "quality" of a poem.

More importantly: although I can enjoy a good dildo as much
as the next man and woman, it does seem that it would be fun,
occasionally, to turn our attention back to poetry and=20
the discussion of it.

I think "Hitler's First Photograph" is particularly bad,
however. I interprete the poem as a mildly ironic construction
with two possible ideas behind it:

1. That all children (and human beings) have the potential for
great evil, and

2. Given the "cutsey" childlike attentions of the adults, that=20
whatever happened to the young Hitler boy, the culture helped=20
to instill.

Both of these ideas are a bit facetious: Certainly we may all have
the potential for great evil, but fortunately there are not that
many Hitlers. And although the culture may have instilled many of
ideas that led to Hitler's actions, it was not committing the vast
atrocities without him.

But what I object to even more than the thematics is the METHOD of=20
the poem. It relies simply on the one word--Hitler. Without that,=20
the entire work would collapse. If you said the Strauss baby, for=20
example, the poem would be truly trite. But Szymborska relies solely=20
on the recognition by her readers that this is not just ANY child, but=20
the monster himself.=20

In short she has created a little construct that relies entirely upon
the reader's agreement before he has even uttered the first word of=20
the poem. There is no discovery of anything in this poem; it is all=20
pre-determined before we have even begun. We will react as we do=20
because the poem hits at the point where the reflex is inevitable.

For me poetry (writing in general) is always a discovery, an uncover-
ing, if you will, of questions more than answers, particularly=20
since it engages the very medium through which we recieve and=20
comprehend the world. There is no room for reflex actions or pre-
conceived constructs in order for the poem to truly exciting.

Storytelling it is--as Henry Gould has responded. But I go with Pound
every time: "Flaubert and De Maupassant lifted prose to the rank of a
finer art, and one has no patience with contemporary poets who escape=20
from all the difficulties of the infinitely difficult art of good=20
prose by pouring themselves into loose verses." At another point,=20
Pound makes clear that he dismisses poets who are merely telling=20
stories by chopping up their lines into verse. For me storytelling=20
(which I love) and poetry are quite different arts.

This is only one poem, however, and I make no claims to know=20
Szymborska's oeuvre. But certainly none of the poems I read=20
(admittedly only seven short poems!) could compare with the poetry=20
of Lorine Niedecker (another so-called "homey" poet) or William=20
Carlos Williams, or George Oppen, or Louis Zukofsky, of Ezra Pound,=20
or Paul Celan, or Benjamin P=E9ret, or Marina Tsvetayeva, or=20
Tchicaya U Tam'si....the list could go on for a long while:=20
all poets who never received the Nobel Prize.

Thanks, Ron, for your good responses.

Well, I personally like the fact that the poem rises or falls on "Hitler"
- that the word disorients the whole. The other point here is the rela-
tion of the Poetics list to traditional and other poetics/ries - Why
_this_ poem up for critique and not one of the less traditional - which
have been far more numerous? Is interpenetrated abstraction harder to
judge? Are we too polite?

There was a billowing and uncomfortable softness to the Szymbroska poem,
even in translation, that reminded me of Dali's Hitler comments, equally
uncomfortable; I'm not at all that willing to dispose so succinctly. As
far as facetiousness, it was a poem, not a thesis, but it does open itself
to thesis/plural, just as any poem does, even bad ones.

Alan,

I guess it depends upon how you define words like "traditional." For
me, the tradition of 20th Century poetry has been one of innovation
and experimentation. The "billowing and uncomfortable" softness which
you describe is characteristic of a great many poems (of any generation)
which are often described as more "traditional" or as (and I think this
is a misnomer, even though I have used it myself) "academic." I just
think they're weaker poems, outside of the great tradition of 20th
century writing.

As for delimiting the critique, I'd have no limits. I just felt the need
to react to the high praise poured upon poets who have won the Nobel Prize.

Enough said from me. But I hope others will go on.

By "billowing and uncomfortable" softness, I was referring to the contents
of the poem, not the style (which I agree with you about of course) - I
just wanted to clarify this. It reminded me in a weird way of Sartre's
Childhood of a Leader.

Subject:      Re: Heidsieck

Ron,

I suppose what I was thinking of with Heidsieck was a perception of fullness and
dimension in his performance that I rarely experience at typical readings of
fiction or poetry.  I think this probably has something to do with a slightly
different understanding of the formal possibilities of reading.  In Heidsieck's
case I think this comes from experimentation outside of the normal channels of
writing, with tape recorders, multi-track recording, etc., that  stress
different units of sense, rhythm and sound.  This allows him, I think, to
conceptualize and perform a reading with a wider range of expressive solutions.
He started one piece, for example, in a gravely whisper and went through a very
varied range of articulation in speed, volume and tone that I think would have
been very difficult to conceptualize without a considerable background in sound
or music.

I think this applies to someone like Robert Ashley too, although certainly in
Ashley's work music is a much more important element.  But again a sense of
sound and performance that is developed outside of textual practice becomes
available to reading, and is reclaimed in some ways as another dimension of the
text.

It's tricky because it gets back to a notion of what the material was in the
first place and how it was formalized.  With Heidsieck you get the sense that
what's performed could function autonomously as a text.  There is a sense of
solidity and craft that almost offers the performance as a bonus or surplus, but
then it's the strength of the performance that convinces you of this fact, so
it's difficult to say finally what enforces the criteria.

I think this sort of thing is somewhat rare in sound poetry.  The more
conceptual approach taken by Gerhard Ruehm, for example, or the more phonemical
and sound oriented work of Henri Chopin, tend to bypass textual paradigms, and
in many other cases where literary forms are foregrounded there is often some
incommensurability that goes along with it.  The text was mediocre, but the
performance of it was good, etc.  With Heidsieck it was all there.

Right, and isn't that kind of the point?  How many Nobel winners got legs?
In 100 years who'll read stuff that just confirms that the cliches of folks
in 1996?  And if its marginally clever, wow, the reader gets to feel smart
too.

We have a guy in town here who wrote a whole chapbook on Mengele -- Mrs.
Mengele worried about her husband's health, that kind of thing.  So
embarrassing!  And they asked him to read at the Jewish Center!  And people

But Doug, what if your idea of the "idea" behind the poem is off the mark?
What if the un-Poundian "looseness" of the [unjudgeably translated] verse
is an effect of concision - i.e., say Szymborska was less concerned with
rhythm and mellifluousness than with brevity and impact?  Setting aside the
question of whether we can so neatly dissect the idea/poem - what if
her "idea" is simply to present the shock of 20th century horror and disaster
buried, encapsulated in the single image of Hitler/child?  i.e. concision -
one of the few (admittedly ambiguous) ways poetry has of speaking the
unspeakable.  - Henry Gould

Hey Judy, maybe you should nominate that poet for the Nobel.  His work
seems to mean a lot to the people around your part of the country.  And
heck, maybe when he's translated into Polish, or the other European languages,
all the dumb slobs over there who want to feel smart will get a kick out
of it too.  Gee, aren't prizes dumb?  - Henry Gould

Both Szymborska's and Heaney's works are examples of the kind of poetry
favored by the Nobel Prize Committee (not to mention the U.S."mainstream"
press and large tracts of academia).

It's the SLOW and UNDEMANDING kind.

Poetry that moves at speeds even a little higher than the average firing of
neurons in a Committee member's brain, or (and perhaps, hence) requires
her/him to read it more than twice, is automatically eliminated. The rest is
"cultural" "politics" and has never been anything else.

It is, of course, unfortunate that the public at large, presented with poorly
translated snippets such as those printed in the U.S. press (of Szymborska's
work), has once again received its annual confirmation of the utter
triviality and irrelevance of poetry.  "If THIS is the BEST...".

NB: It is also not surprising that three recent Nobel laureate poets (the
late Josef Brodsky, Derek Walcott, and Seamus Heaney) have just appeared as
co-authors of a festschrift to, you guessed it, the pretty darn slow and
undemanding Robert Frost.

Subject:      nobel prize

Hey wait a minute, the Nobel prize in literature is political (in the New
York Times front page sense) rather than literary, even if sometimes
writers of genuine literary value win.  The Szymborska prize is related
to bringing Poland into Europe, along with promises of NATO enlargement
and eventual EU membership.  The last two "Polish" Nobel Laureates (I.B.
Singer and Czeslaw Miloscz) were American citizens; Singer didn't even
write in Polish.  She is representative of Polish intellectuals who did
not go into exile and maintained integrity despite Communism etc etc.
She gets the prize instead of the somewhat better known Zbignew Herbert
because (I'm guessing) of a) her gender and b) Herbert's international
reputation presupposes a greater degree of compromise with the
authorities.  I don't know the Polish language but I am sure that, within
its parameters, she is a fine a poet.  The way the prize seems to work is
that a country or region is deemed due for the prize, and then the issue
is, which of that locations leading writers is most appropriate -- thus,
Oe Kenzaburo over Inoue Yasasushi or Endo Shusaku.  I don't know
what other Irish writer besides Heaney there was to chose from,
but clearly the Northern Ireland peace process is responsible for
his award.  Meanwhile, Pearl Buck remains the only Chinese writer to have
won, French writers seem scandalously underrepresented, etc.

Who is poetry for?

This is the basis of the entire thread. Frost, like it or not (and I'm not
fond of him), has a wide-spread audience, much larger than most of the
people, if not all of us, writing on Poetics. So we decry demographics,
yes? We retain a certain purity against slow and undemanding work?

No, Daniel, that is not a natural reaction. That is a conditioned response.
It is something they pick up from their racist families and friends, etc.

resend to old thread

     I'm sure there are several on the list more conversant with the
poetic and language implications of the following.  For me it also has
some interesting psychological and neuropsycholical implications:


"that spell of the "sheer sound of words" which bursts out in the
expressive, sorcerous, and mythopoetic tasks of language, and to the
utmost extent in poetry...endowing the distinctive features
themselves with the power of _immediate_ signification.....in
rereading the poem 'Das grosse Lalula' of Christian Morgenstern in
his book of _Galgenlieder_ introduced by Zarathrustra's saying - 'a
true man conceals in himself a child who wants to play' - one is
struck by lines...with glossolalic _ntr_, ...[and] counting-out
rhymes....it was precisely the counters of children's games which
inspired the versicle '_Vanja-banja_' ...by the Russian avant-garde
poet Elena Guro (1877-1913)." (234)

"the drive for autonomization through the use of the sound shape with
no evident meaning attached...[as in] glossalalia....[and a] magical
formula chanted for protection.... Such usage is correlated with the
magical function of language.  It is seen as a way for the human and
the divine, the human and the superhuman, to communicate.   Obvious
resemblences to avant-garde poetry...; to children's counting-out
rhymes...; to the verbal play which children seem to delight in...;
and to magical phraseolical expressions.
     All of these uses show the so-to-speak 'spell' of the speech
sounds...the drive for autonomization and _immediacy_ of the
distinctive features is associated with the mythical, the poetic, the
magical, and the playful use of language." (270)

Pearl Buck is Chinese? Nevah heard of it. Actually Chinese writers have
been crying all the time that us chinks have never gotten anything from
them Nordics. But the committee blamed on the translation. I blame the
translation too, but for a different reason (see my essay "The
Translator's Invisible hand: The Problems in the Introduction of
Contemporary Chinese Poetry" in _River City_ Winter 1996 issue).

I'm really sick of my countrymen wanting the prize so bad. I like what
Pierre Joris (hi, P, your recent visit at Buffalo was wonderful!) and
Anselm Hollo said about this prize-winning event. Nobel Prize is not
always the right place to look for interesting works. I won't be surprized
at all if Bei Dao gets it in the near future, but the fact is Bei Dao's
poetry is no longer interesting to many people. Go and read it if you
don't believe me. The time when the Nobel Committee can no loger blame on
the translation, when the translation of Bei Dao's poetry become smooth
and transparent enough to cater to the committee member's taste (a
tendency I bashed in my essay), Bei Dao will get it. But it will only give
me more reasons to ignore whatever comes out of that royal academy.

The exchange on 4 Oct was fascinating because I rreally felt something

with Messerli on how all those ommissions 'prove' the problems of the
Nobel,or perhaps any prize.
But maybe it's the 'play' of language in someone like Armantrout that can't
be translated, while the 'thematic' of the Hitler poem is all too obvious.
I could read it with s light smile & say, yeah, while with her stuff I'm
always, delightedly, at sea, I admit. The shoe never does drop, so I keep
coming back to watch the performance again.

Subject:      Re: Szymborska/Heaney/Nobels

i think, as alan says, the question does turn on what poetry is for, who
it's for, etc...

clearly, whether we find it merely interesting or useful or trivializing or
politically motivated or commercial, poetry has its uses... now if you come
at it in literary terms, and you're careful to define what those terms are,
you can probably argue for the aesthetic value of just about anything...
and poetry as a contested site then turns on the specifically literary
value one finds in it...

which is not to say that it isn't somehow political at the same time (as
are all consequent judgments)...

but if you come at it in political terms, it may be that lamentably
simplistic poetry (from somebody's literary angle, i mean) does enormous
political or cultural work...

so it does seem---what i'm trying to say, sorry for not saying it
sooner---that in passing judgment, we ought at least to be willing to
clarify our presuppositions... this list has a good number of folks subbed
who subscribe as well to an interest in and positive appraisal of langpo
(right?), hence it's somewhat less than surprising to find criticism here
of nobel laureate work... i would like to think we might at times be just
as critical of langpo work (have we been?---which we? which work?)... and i
would like to think, in any case, we would try to serve up our judgments
with due regard for other aesthetics & politics and such like... which is
to say, make legible what it is we come to poetry for...

perhaps the problem, specifically, is that there's more than two aesthetics
around these parts...?...

Dear Henry,

My only response is that there are certainly much
better ways to present "horror and disaster." Indeed,
I didn't feel any "horror or disaster" from
her poem--she persumed it, but her poem certainly
didn't present me with any. That's my point. It's
all preconceived. No horror. No disaster in this
cutesy-pie poem.

Having just published a book on the "horrors" of Nazism
and World War II (part of a larger exploration of
evil in the 20th century) I'm most interested in methods
of presenting or--as I would prefer--discovering and
questioning the horrors of our past--and potential future.

Didn't see them in Szymbroska at all.

About that Norton. Havng tried to teach from it, in a regularized course on
British & American poetry post-WW2, so not looking for anything too far
out, I still couldnt believe how bad the choices were for 'their' poets
(bad on Lowell for example in some ways, very poor on Hughes), but also how
absolutely awful the choices were for, say, Olson, in terms of what an
anthology might be assumed to do, & then never no never after all these
years, a sign of even a small serial poem from Spicer. I gave up. This
doesnt sound much better (& up here, the cost!) I'd agree about the Oppen
too. Let alone the recent writers -- feh!

Hey you all:  Here's an update from the Ear Inn:

Saturday October 5th was the first reading of the series, featuring
Brooklyn poet Prageeta Sharma and Providence poet Mark McMorris.  It was a
rocking day-- Prageeta opening with new work (recently rejected by the
Paris Review) which was very cool.  Mark read some new and some old
favorite poems which were "exposed, meandering, supine" and great.  Mark
has a brand new beautiful chapbook from Burning Deck (Mothwings) and his
book The Black Reeds is coming out from University of Georgia Press in
February.

The audience included fashionable luminous luminaries Jackson MacLow, Stacy
Doris, Judith Goldman, baseball great Bill Luoma, Douglas Rothschild (of
the New York Rothschilds), Chris Stroffolino, new new yorkers Anselm
Berrigan  and Lee Ann Brown, Drew Gardner, Joe and Leo Elliot, Segueway
baron Dan Machlin, West Coast poet Robert V. Hale, Iowa poet Katy Lederer,
Samuel Truitt, Sean Killian, Julie Patton, a table of unidentified poetry
lovers and/or government agents, and a bunch of people watching baseball at
the bar.

The Ear in is at 326 Spring Street, readings start at 2:30, $3
contribution.

Don't miss out on the fun/never a dull moment/sometimes a free beer-- if
you happen to be in new york next saturday October 12 you can come to see
Cliff "secret bard of the lower east side" Fyman and Lee Ann "crush groove"
Brown.  Cliff's been working on a new series of Mayer-esque experiments and
Lee Ann will be reading from new and forthcoming work-- keep an eye out for
her book Polyverse, soon to arrive from sun and moon.

Subject:      Re: Szymborska/Heaney/Nobels

While I agree with Simon & Jordan that the Nobel is political-- it seems to
me that this merely increases the need to raise aesthetic questions with
regard to those anointed. Is the Nobel in Literature anything more than bad
poets used for propaganda purposes?  Occasionally it may be, though I have no
examples at hand. This is not to say that the propoganda aims may not on
occasion have some efficacy-- however it is one more example of the degree to
which individuals are subject to state authority. That this is _so_ obvious
is exactly why it needs to be pointed out.

_The Best American Poetry 1996_ edited by Adrienne Rich, was recently
published. The introduction contains an epigram and two or three citations
from Charles Bernstein's _A Poetics_. The book itself, which, admittedly, I
have not examined carefully, seems to contain very little that would fall
under the rubric "innovative writing." Past editions of this "Best" have
included a number of such writers. So, discursive statements about the
usefulness of an aesthetics of multiplicity are ok, but the actual practice
of such. . . ? I'll look at the book a bit more, hopefully it's more
interesting than it appears.

I must leeeeap in here.  Please say more.  This is an idea that intrigues
me so much I want to fashion it into some kind of dissertation--having
sprung into it via Finnegans Wake rather than Heaney.  And as a political
reclaiming move, like Tom Leonard foregrounding the local English over
mainstream (or BBC as he says), as Susan Schultz says of Lois Ann Yamanaka
here.  And the local Englishes--as I well know from having lived in
Ireland and Hawai'i--rooted in the grammar and much of the vocabulary of
the language(s) that was there before.  gab.

Does the current bankruptcy of Duty and Truth leave
poetry as play as the lone pillar?

From the apparently infamous Steele book:

"Kant's _Critique_ 'Poetry...expands the mind by giving
freedom to the imagination...free, spontaneous, and
independent of determination by nature..as a sort of
schema for, the supersensible.  It plays with
semblance, which it produces at will, but not as an
instrument of deception; for its avowed purpose is
merely one of play.'
     "Poetry lacks direct relevance to the world of
empirical fact and ethics...it is merely
'play'...spontaneous...'self-active' Power of
Imagination'"

Poe - "Poetry of words.._The Rhythmical Creation of
Beauty_.  Its sole arbiter is Taste.  With the
Intellect or with the Conscience, it has only
collateral relations.  Unless incidentally, it has no
concern whatever either with Duty or Truth."

This is NOT Kevin, this is Dodie.

I don't think anyone said S's poems were drivel because they weren't
language poetry.  They were declared drivel from the perspective of the
type of poetry they were attempting to be (with reservations given due to
the vagaries of translation).  Pushing this into a langpo versus the rest
of poetry is irritating to me.

As far as political poetry goes, San Francisco is reeking with bad
political poetry.  Nobody's giving any of it a Nobel Prize.

From the perspective of someone trying against all odds to curate an
"experimental" reading series (many of my readers would never want to be
called langpos) I'm very appreciative of any space that provides a welcome
environment to share and discuss the avante-garde.  Even though I've been
critical of the theory "boys" in the past I actually miss them on this
listserv.  Most of the world is against experimental writing.  It's too bad
this space has been co-opted by so many who share that againstness.

Hi everyone, this is Kevin Killian.

If any of you are going to be in the Bay Area on Wednesday (October 9) (and
I know many of you will be), then please come to my play, "Wet Paint,"
which Small Press Traffic is presenting in collaboration with the San
=46rancisco Art Institute, in conjunction with the "Beat Culture and the New
America" show which has just opened here in S.F.

It's on Wednesday, October 9, 7:30 p.m. at the San Francisco Art Institute
Lecture Hall (800 Chestnut Street at Jones Street, SF)=8Ba block up from
Columbus.  And cheap!  It is only $6 to get in=8Bfour dollars if you are a
student or a member of Small Press Traffic.  And if you attend the Art
Institute you get in free.

One woman . . . Jay DeFeo . . . walking a perilous tightrope between
obscurity and fame in the late 1950s. The brilliant romantic artist,
taunted by sister Kay de Feo, a mind so vicious she sneaks in night after
night to dash more paint on Jay=B9s finished production. Jay, woman, rebel,
artist, haunted by a shoplifting arrest in her past, and puzzled by how
dark her apartment seems to be getting. And the men in her life, the _cute
guys_ who made North Beach a bongodelia of high art and Beat esteem--Bruce
Conner, Wallace Berman, Michael McClure, Wally Hedrick, Kenneth Anger. And
the visitors from Mexico, who dared Jay De Feo to her masterpiece por
chevre--Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera! Her shady psychiatrist, pressuring
her to abandon feminist art work and return to Hallmark sell-out. The
Hollywood starlet who came to the Fillmore to study up for an important
role--Tuesday Weld. And Janis Joplin, the woman who worshipped Jay and
inspired =B3The Rose.=B2

"They invented a new kind of art . . . and a new kind of SEX to go with
it!"  Starring D-L Alvarez, David Buuck, Ethel Chase, Norma Cole, Margaret
Crane, Kate Delos, Kathi Georges, Phoebe Gloeckner, Craig Goodman, Jonathan
Hammer, Clifford Hengst, Scott Hewicker, Caitlin Mitchell-Dayton, Karla
Milosevich, Rex Ray, Michelle Rollman, Leslie Scalapino, Wayne Smith and
Alicia Wing.

Actually, the play will have no reference to the artist (and former
iconoclast) Bruce Conner, whose attorneys wrote to me very sternly shortly
after the publicity began to unfold about my play.  They claimed they had
an advance copy of my play (wrong!  I just finished it yesterday!) and that
under no circumstance was I to use his a) name b) image or c) likeness in
what he calls a "frivolous exploitation" of his work.  I wanted to hire a
lawyer of my own, to accuse him of prior restraint, etc., --but decided not
to, it's supposed to be fun.  So come on down and help me pay tribute to a
great artist, Jay DeFeo, and the California funk assemblage movement in
general.  Thanks for your bandwidth everyone.

There are also some members of the gliterati on both sides of the Atlantic
(but not, as far as I know, on the "far" side of the Pacific) who think
that Jung Chang (author _Ugly Ducklings_) is a "Chinese writer".

"Chinese" ?

"writer" ?????? !!!!!!

... It's just that this is precisely the sort of problem that those of us
trying to get Chinese writers *read* 'over here' have to deal with. The
general reader *does* think that Pearl Buck, Han Suyin, Jung Chang etc. are
Chinese writing.

The Many Press (London) has just set up a web site at:

        http://www.demon.co.uk/eastfield/many/

Please visit it when you can. The site is based on the 1995 annotated
catalogue which covered 20 years of the press's output. It's a long and
interesting list and it continues to grow.

"The Press when founded was part of the poetic revival of the late Sixties
and early Seventies; there was a feeling, quite widely shared, that much of
what was most interesting was likely to be found outside the productions of
the mainstream publishers. Changes in the technology of typesetting and
printing also had much to do with it. During the Seventies I printed a
number of publications at the Printshop of the Poetry Society. Financially
the Press has always been a non-profit-making venture, though the
limitations of my time and energy, rather than financial considerations, are
what have mainly restricted the Press' output."

- from the introduction to the catalogue by the editor, John Welch

NEW PUBLICATIONS

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peaceworks by Andrew Shelley.
Poems. 24pp. 1996. GB Pounds: 3.00. 0 907326 34 X

Andrew Shelley was born in Huddersfield in 1962. He was educated at the
University of Cambridge and at Oxford where he held a fellowship and wrote a
doctoral dissertation on Samuel Beckett. He has also held scholarships at
the universities of Athens, Crete and Istanbul. His articles and literary
journalism have appeared in a wide range of publications including Essays in
Criticism and The Sunday Times and his poetry in various little magazines
and anthologies. He is currently preparing a collection of poems and a prose
work. He lives in Oxford.

Shelley's is an intellectual yet sensuous poetry in which the insisted-upon
details of individual experience are held in often rebarbative contact with
the increasingly embattled categories of mind that support shared life,
common society. Despite this, by virtue of a reasoned intuition that attends
as much to the particular contingencies of life - at home in work and love -
as to their wider determinations, there occur moments of great lyrical
intensity in which thinking and feeling combine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Onion House by Kate Bass.
Poems. 16pp. 1996. GB Pounds: 2.50. 0 907326 35 8

Kate Bass was born in East Finchley in North London in 1962. Poems of hers
have appeared in magazines; this is her first collection to be published.
After graduating in Chemistry from Edinburgh University in the early
eighties she worked for the Patent Agency in London. In 1989 Kate Bass moved
to Cambridge; since 1993 she has been studying Illustration at Anglia
Polytechnic University.

Kate Bass' poems combine directness with a strong sense of mystery. There is
great accomplishment in the apparently calm and ordered balance of her
narratives; but always underlying them a haunting sense of otherness. It is
writing which can, for instance, introduce the myth of Persephone in a
manner which is all the more effective for seeming quite natural and
unforced.

The Onion House features a cover illustration by Kate Bass.

Subject:      SOME OTHER KIND OF MISSION

Anselm sugggests that the Nobel prize committee wants work that won't
cause short circuits in their brains (or rapid sub-cranial movements of
any kind). Big surprise. My own favorite would have been Bao Dei, who
has written some poems that read well in English. And it would have
been nice to have had a laureate younger than I. It may be that his
work has "smoothened" out to reach that take-it-slow crowd. Remember,
that if they gave it for music, Tom Jones would've had a Nobel years
ago.

Still, I think there's always the question (often a political one) of
how a given writer's work fits into her/his society, as such. Brodsky
has a very different meaning in Russia (where he represented a total
refusal to "play along") than in the US (where he became another Cold
War icon) and I've often wondered *which* Brodsky won the prize.

If there were justice in this world, we'd be hearing the names Creeley
and Ginsberg on the short list for such awards, not to mention Rakoski,
Guest, Ortiz, Grahn....

On the other hand, if you want to give your brains and heart a real
workout, there's another great new book out -- SOME OTHER KIND OF
MISSION by Lisa Jarnot, from Burning Deck ($11, wherever good books are
sold...which means SPD, Woodland Pattern & through Rod at Bridge
Street). It'll remind you why you read poetry in the first place.

I'm sorry to grind another minor issue to small powder - but are you saying
there's no irony in the poem?  That it's a Norman Rockwell cutesy-pie
image of Hitler as child?  No, you're not going that far.  You're saying
she "presumed" the history.  Well, I'm saying that was her point: to
hide it all in full view.  To maintain silence & show Hitler as a child:
a shocking thing to do in a poem.  You found it distasteful; but however
one finds the poem, the reader IS confronted with the history that followed,
by means of the concise bizarre fusion of Hitler/child.  - Henry Gould

"natural in that what they (probably most) are exposed to up to the point of

I was not saying that bigotry and racism are natural. Perhaps "inevitable"
would have been a better word to describe the reactions of students (the
students of Dodie and Maria; reactions that students of mine have also had)
when presented with ideas and material that radically challenges notions of the
world that they may have been brought up with.

I will strive to be more careful with my choice of words.

No, Daniel, that is not a natural reaction. That is a conditioned response.
It is something they pick up from their racist families and friends, etc.
Nature never was guilty of that kind of prejudice.

well dodie you got a point...

but i got a point too!...

the point is simply this:  i haven't heard anybody around here, who's
stayed around here for any length of time, dismiss a langpoem (and please
permit me this  shorthand)---or for that matter much of what you're calling
"experimental" work, which i like to think i'm committed to mself---with a
tag as summary as douglas's "drivel"...

if this *has* happened, please refresh my memory...

in any case, and being only a bit of a gadfly, i think it's only fair to
observe that it FEELS easier around here to tag a nobel laureate's work so
than to so tag a poem by, say, zukofski...

now i far prefer, mself, zuk to szymborska... but that's not the point, or
at least, not my point... and i agree with rod, insofar that there would
seem to be a mainstream against which many different alternative poetries
are inevitably 'measured' and dismissed... still, i was pressing a bit to
ask whether, in fact, there is some inertia around here when it comes to
self-critique, by which i mean critique of more experimental forms... and
the only way i know to handle this w/o presumption is to propose judgments
along with a sense of where one is coming from...

but mebbe that's just the point---mebbe there's already the assumption of
some shared assumptions that not everybody around here shares...

best,

First of all, I don't think that tolerance for other schools has ever lead
to good poetry or art--or has ever been a requirement for poets or artists.
Poets should have the right to draw from whatever feeds them and to
dismiss the rest.

And you and others are right that drivel is a really ugly, dismissive word.
I never would have used it--it does reverb with bigotry.

I don't think that people who are into expermental writing (langpo being
just one vein of that) do have these uniformly shared assumptions.  When
this list was smaller there was lots of fighting going on among the
members.  I think people are very aware of the lack of shared asssumptions
on this list.  I think that's why many people I'd like to be hearing from
are no longer posting.  There has to be a certain common ground for things
to be worth discussing.

Yes, Dan, please do that.

Dan's posting reminded me that I never responded to any of the responses to
my original post.  First of all, thanks for all the support and good
suggestions I received on this list and back channel.

By way of follow-up, the two ringleaders of the racist responses dropped my
class.  The remaining nine students are sweet as can be.  I enjoy all of
them.  Their written responses to Giscombe were not racist.  One guy,
without ever referring to the Giscombe essay, wrote this gruesome little
story about capturing mice in traps.  I liked it a lot.  I encourage them
to give "creative" responses to the readings, not essays.

When we had our follow-up discussion, neither of the ringleaders was there
and the rest of the class apologized to me for not being more vocal in
combatting them.  One woman who hadn't read the essay when the blow-up
happened said she went home and read it and was very confused about what
the problem was for the other students.

I think that the extreme negative reaction to the essay went beyond
racism--I think that many of the students found the Giscombe essay more
formally challenging than I had anticipated--to me it was pretty
straightforward.  I think its unconventional formal elements were
threatening to some and they didn't have the vocabulary to address that
(beyond "This guy can't write!") and so they attacked something they knew
how to talk about.

and I would direct him to the also imitable Alfred Corn who on the CAP-L

langpoem bad.'

What would make a Seamus Heaney poem good? Or for that matter a poem by any
of the other 'squish-poets' -- Kinnell Hughes Rich etc -- or the
'pinot-grigio' poets or the coff coff -- go ahead Rod investigate the Best

but don't think of it as a book of poems, think of it as a game of
concentration. When you find an unusual word, try and remember where else
in the book you saw THE SAME WORD. When you find a person writing under
unusual circumstances, find someone else writing under THE SAME
CIRCUMSTANCES. When you notice a profoundly corny figure -- aerial view of
town at night -- find another poem with THE EXACT SAME FIGURE.

Do not assume that great poems will simply come along. Ridicule anyone who
tells you what you have to do or what you cannot do in a poem.

Joe -- why don't _you_ tell us what a bad language poem is.

geez, jordan, alfred corn?...

ok:  am trying to get other poetic pov's into this discussion, much in line
with dodie's observation that there are those on this list who no longer
post (and i feel this latter of late too)... and i've (or had anyway) a
hunch that one reason could be possibly b/c they don't want to be accused
of liking drivel... but perhaps this is too too harsh a way of putting
things, at least insofar as douglas m. is concerned... i understand that he
was himself being provocative... but perhaps in being provocative he
touched a nerve that needed touching... in any case, i can imagine a public
context (not this one) where i might have mself made an observation similar
to douglas's... but my point, again, is why was it made here?...

so, what makes a bad langpoem bad?...

er, no---what makes a langpoem bad?... or what do i expect of such poetry
(assuming we could have a "such") that, lacking, i tend to see as bad?...
pretty much (isn't this a surprise?) what i would say makes most poetry
bad---lack of engagement, of follow-through with the aesthetic... not
wringing out of the words so many of their possibilities (and i mean
thematic as well), or not creating a formal context through which such
wringing might take place...

which is probably an argument for complexity of sorts...

Okay Jrdn, here's something from left field.  There are the usual qualities
that are called for in your basic good poem: the ones you mentioned, plus
music, sense of the language (meaning & sound), originality, sense of past
writings, sense of future writings.  Let's continue with baseball metaphor
& consider realm of poetry a playing field, where sometimes there are levels
of standards, not set in stone, but people have a sense of them.  Then there
are some of real originality who sort of make the game their own.  They can do
all the basics - but they personalize everything, take it to a new level of
freedom & depth.

Some qualities these originals rely on, I believe, that you don't hear much
about nowdays, are: anonymity, modesty, renunciation. Tools by which poetry
enters other dimensions of the human conversation.  Opposite side from
mannerism, poem as autotelic object, etc.  The danger here, is kind of
debased "civic" poetry, poetry used for some manipulative purpose; but the
real originals tend to avoid this or transcend this category.  This is the
feeling of Russian poetry & culture that I harp on now & then & that real exper
ts in it (which I'm not) will probably deny: but it's a kind of modesty
& solemnity which you just don't hear in American poetry nowdays, that I'm
aware of.  A solemnity coming from a sense of commitment to a larger
conversation, & a free place within it for poetry. Probably has its down side
too (the hokum of the Serious).
Think of Anonymous as the perennial benchmark for quality.
Just rambling here.   - Henry G

Addendum to previous:  maybe part of sense that Russian poetry is part of
a larger conversation is due to the fact that Russians not only like
to sit around drinking and talking - it's kind of an integral everyday
ritual & part of their life (or used to be).  The bigger conversation
was happening right in your own crowded apartment. - HG

Try Eavan Boland's _Object Lessons_ for "other" Irish.


Let me second that recommendation. Boland's memoir (published by
Norton last year) is a brilliant critique of an entire  tradition, in this case,
 Irish and Anglo-Irish poetry, which carefully exposes the male
domination of the forms, down to the expectations of the poetic voice,
the poetic subjects, and the poet himself in his public and private
persona, in the pub, in the classroom, in the bedroom. she candidly
recounts her own instinctive acknowledgment that this was the case,
her early careerist attempt to  orient herself as a "male" poet and, only
after having met with some unsatisfying success and then experiencing
motherhood, did she find an alternative voice, for herself at least, and
perhaps for others... her book also broadens, or perhaps it is deepens,
the interesting site of struggle that language is in Ireland, which I have
always taken as a coherent example of how cultural, political and in
boland's case sexual issues are fought out at the level of language.
Also, the book is beautifully written.

Yes, poets and everyone else for that matter is free to draw whatever aesthetic
and political lines they want as far as their own tastes and poetics are
concerned.  However, it seems gratuitous to slam Frost-- who never won a Nobel,
who is not exactly a live wire these days, and who was once marginally
innovative even if we now assume his poetic to be a dead end.

As for the ad hominem remarks on the slow-wittedness of readers who prefer
Heaney et al and/or who actively dismiss other traditions, I am reminded of the
Speed & Performance threads of a couple months back.  What kinds of mental and
physical operations does experimental poetry require/enact/enforce, and is it
possible to produce inductive arguments about their political and psychological
differences from the Nobel stuff, on the basis of their respective rates of
consumption?  Answering these questions seems a more interesting response to
the perennial retrospection and repetition compulsion of these
award-givers/receivers.  I am not persuaded that Creeley or Snyder say, are
running at a different speeds from other poets like Merwin or Simic who are not
affiliated with avant-garde social networks.  However, Zukofsky or Olson, say,
are demanding different responses than Walcott and Heaney, but settling for or
even reinforcing an implicit binarism is not going to crack the institutional
prejudice against the global energies of experimentalism.

ok, i'll bite.
I wonder if the call for folks to identify "good" language poems might be
met with an embarassment of silences; or perhaps a few nominations,
in jordanspeak, of "non-bad langpoems."

i could say, show me a good hannah weiner poem and I'll show you a
bad language poem, but i haven't read all of hannah. do i need to?

or p inman, who once read a paper at st mark's that was brilliant. still, i
haven't read all of P; do i need to?

for a good language poem: mac low's light poems, all of them. and
anything in jackson's  From Pearl harbord Day to FDR's birthday, from
Sun & Moon.

and Bruce Andrew's Wobbling, or Give em Enough Rope, Fiona
Templeton's London.

what makes for a poem i want to read over and over? an order of
sounds I delight in hearing or having my tongue perform that themselves
suggest or imply worlds of possible meaning that destabilize the one I
left before entering the poem and that manage to permanently alter the
world of meaning i return to. that's all. This has happened to me with
writers as diverse as Gertrude Stein and Paul Muldoon, and never
Heaney. Or Olson. Or Charles Bernstein. Allan Davies yes. And wild
Steve McCaffery. But never Neidecker. Someone stop me,  I will stop,

I think there's plenty of support for experimental poetry on this list,
enough that I don't see why we couldn't critique some of it without
much risk of losing our "common ground."  If anything, i wld probably want
even more "difference."  If "experimental" folks (and i count myself one,
for lack of a better term) are reluctant to post, even
here, because of the perception of such difference, that doesn't seem to
me to speak well of the vigor of the discourse.

And besides, as any one
here knows, it doesn't take that many voices to make a strong thread
anyway, so if there's something to say that isn't getting said why not
just take a shot?  steve

 There is also a Samoan student at M.A. level, who can and
does write a more standard English, but in middle of that will devote
several sentences to a kind of apologetic tone about discussing high

distrustful of and defensive towards pakeha culture.  But she doesn't
write an altogether different English from what is usually thought of
as "standard" in the academy.

This is nothing new to many on the List I suppose. But it has become

Nobel Prize = best poetry money can buy.

The whole idea of the Nobel & its ilk raises the old Ciceronian "Who
benefits?" Not poetry, I think. Rather the bourgeois institutions that seek
to quell the anxiety they experience vis-a-vis "art" and so create wprizes
and whatnot to that end. The Nobel has always seemed to me a ratification of
the status quo. Writing that "agitates the sleep of mankind" seldom is
recognized by the Committee (though Beckett would certainly seem to prove
the exception).  James Agee once spoke of "the emasculation of acceptance"
when talking about the relationship between art and its intended audience.
That's a pretty loaded phrase, to be sure; divisive and more than a bit
juvenile, but if the shoe fits...

At all events, no writer should be looking for rewards from captains of
industry. How the Nobel gratifies bestower and  recipient, but esp. the
former, tells us more about the current relationship between art, commerce
and culture, then about putative "artistic merit." It seems to me that once
you establish the idea of a prize, you've already compromised something
essential in the creative process.

Hi Libbie --

The "academy of the future is/ Opening its doors" is from the poem "Last

Subject:      yet more Nobel

Of course, prizes are the devil's blessing, but I am unsure whether the
"status quo" argument is accurate.  Beckett is indeed a major exception,
but then again, who would deny his importance?  What about Claude Simone
and Octavio Paz?  These recent winners are not exactly "status quo" and
have direct ties to avant-gardism.  Going a little further back, what about
Neruda and Montale?  Sure they're safe enough now, but that wasn't always
the case.  I know that quibbling about a roster is not really getting to
the heart of the poetic issues necessarily raised by this year's selection,
but I thought maybe the ambiguous examples I have cited would complicate
the tendency to think of the prize as only going to the Pearl Bucks of the
world.

Michael Coffey,
In naming Inman & Weiner as the langpos you're not enticed by I'm tempted to
say oh, so you really don't like language poetry. To say a few words not so
much in defense but in response-- both of these poets seem to me to write on
their own terms, there is a very strong sense of the immediacy & integrity in
the writing. Ok, what immediacy, what integrity?

Inman's immediacy is that the weight of each letter, each word, each phrase,
each paragraph is the same, & they are all weighed very carefully. The writer
has attended to them neither more nor less than they demand. Peter often
mentions Beckett (a fine synonym for integrity), & one senses in his work
that Beckettian understanding that there is really nothing to be gotten from
the writing other than the experience of it, the doing of it. So, to be
gotten from the reading of it is a very particular kind of intelligence, I
can't help but think of deKooning but without the heroic junk.

Hannah's a dialogic hurricane. Hurricane's have something like 200,000 times
the power of an atomic bomb. One feels that the intensity of engagement with
language that _she_ feels in the writing is something like that. If you don't
like hurricanes, don't go there.
I'm fascinated by them. Or if you don't like that overblown analogy simply
say that it's a multiple dialogism -- there's _a_ conversation going on in
her work, but it's not locatable, it never stays in one place long enough, &
yet it's _information_. & I think often she's very funny. Try _The Fast_,
though _Little Books/Indians_ is possibly my favorite.

Not liking Olson or Bernstein or Niedekker's a conudrum I shan't engage at
the moment. But o I plea that the great infinity might bestow upon you the
treasures & fruits & vegetables of their wondrous labour

I'm emerging from a long period of lurkerdom to announce a new journal:

        CURRENT - journal of the mind & senses

        http://www.comm-unity.co.nz/~current/

It includes work by listmembers Charles Alexander, Tom Beard, John
Geraets, Tony Green and ShaunAnne Tangey. Other contributors with whom
you may be familiar include Ebon Fisher, David Howard, Kapka Kassabova,
Sugu Pillay and Mark Williams.

The contents will be updated as new work comes to hand, and an
announcement on the print version will be made shortly.

CURRENT aims to be a multi-disciplinary, multi-media journal, and
includes poetry, audio, theory, fiction, interviews and visual art. Also
of note is "Complete with Instructions", possibly the first use of Java
to present and animated poem.

I look forward to your feedback.


        Tom Beard.

Something compels me to buy the BAP books every year and for the past few
I've found little to reward the reflex... the Rich edition, while I'm not
crazy about it, is the first one in a while that hasn't left me mostly
regretting another year of the habit.  As for the relationship between her
intro and the book itself I'd say her appropriation of the Bernstein quotes
hold up for the purpose of her essay at least --i.e. really only one instance
 where she takes anything that C.B. has to say towards "innovation" in
writing, and there she's citing only a few of her choices (& they're actually
ones I agree with, a really good Giscombe poem for one).
    Now for the rest of the book  & the ensuing practice, -- or two
practices, I guess, one is Rich's selection & she's pretty honest about her
priorities, admitting to pushing aside the designations of "best" ...
 anyway, when it comes to the poets themselves and _their_ practice of an
aesthetic multiplicity I got the vague feeling that they blew it somehow,
 usually in the form of too much "post-practice": something like 50 pages of
contributor's notes filled w/ anecdotes and/or explanations for things that
not particularly evident in the poems themselves (esp. disheartening when
they were "formal choices") --in short, a lot of "aesthetic" that didn't seem
to make it into the poems.  Overall I guess I consider the collection as a
document of Rich's encouragement and read the poems together w/ her intro as
an assessment of so much more that needs to be done towards a poetics of
innovation and difference... it's not an easy choice but I guess I'd rather
see some of the poems fall visibly short of the editor's expressed standards,
as opposed to the limits of a safer consistency that I've seen in BAP before.

I think Pindar, for one, would disagree.  Isn't there a love/hate atmosphere
for everyone, winners/losers & bystanders, involved with prizes?  But the
world would be a drabber place without races, competitions, prizes,
recognitions.  A "simpler" place, in a negative sense. I don't think the
Nobel committee, or anyone else, considers the Nobel the ultimate arbiter
of value.  The arbiter, in literature, is the reader, the audience.  I
for one was moved when Naguib Mahfouz won the Nobel, & it's sad if
it's considered another example of Western imperialism. - Henry Gould

Dora Marsden was the editor of the Freewoman which became the New
Freewoman and then The Egoist around 1914. At that time she asked
Harriet Weaver to take over editorial responsibilities while Marsden
pursued her interest as a philosophical writer (while writing for the
magazine that went on to hire Pound as literary editor and to publish
work by Joyce, Eliot, HD, Aldington, Fletcher, de Gourmont, etc.).
Marsden's books include The Definition of the Godhead, The Mystery of
Time, and The Philosophy of Time.

If you can, you should check out the original issues of the magazines.
They're fascinating. Pound, Joyce, and HD alongside articles on
vegetarianism and free love and Marsden's long philosophical essays on
time and the godhead.

yes of course Mrs. Buck was born (nee Seidenstricker, I think) somewhere
in West Virginia and only went to the orient as a small child (not sure
of exact date -- her parents were missionaries).

The nobel prize line is a misremembered quote from John Yau.

however, her translation of the Shui Hu Chuan, which she called "All Men
are Brothers," (its otherwise translated as "The Water Margin" or
"Outlaws of the Marsh") is well worth anybody's reading.  It is a
slightly odd sounding English she used, probably affected by her
translation method (supposedly, because she was fluent and illiterate in
Chinese, she had a collaborator read the book aloud to her and she
translated from that) but it gives more of the flavor and feel of
that kind of Chinese literature than anything else I know.  Rexroth was a
fan of her translation, so is Alice Notley.

The part of the baseball metaphor that comes to my mind is the team
thing. After all the razzle dazzle aesthetics (which start to sound
remarkable like something cribbed from John Crowe Ransome or Allen
Tate), everybody just wants their team to win. The problem is the umps
are all recruited from the other team(s).

Wow, that's the most scandalous, avant-grade thing ever posted here!

Have people on the list heard that Bob Dylan sold the rights to "The
Times They Are a Changin'" to the Bank of Montreal for use in their
new advertising campaign? Maybe that was part of the deal of that got
him shortlisted for the Nobel.

This is just not the kind of world in which Bob Creeley can ever get
the Nobel prize. Maybe we should make up our own prize and award it to
him.

Yeah, but they agreed to change the lyrics to: "The Monies they are

Subject:      WCW vs. The Sonnet

Libby Rifkin et al, It's not quite in the words you quoted, but the line
of WCW's I like re sonnets is in his Author's Introduction (1944) to the
Collected Later Poems: "To me all sonnets say the same thing of no import-
ance." He goes on to clarify, "There is no poetry of distinction without
formal Invention...." Which may be what we're really griping about vis a vis
the poem on baby Shickelgruber. On that thread, though, I don't trust The
New York Times to choose a poet's best work--there's a politics of that
level of selection also. I'm suspending judgment until I read more work.

Subject:      nobels, the Good, here we go...

(1) re the nobels:  any way we might speculate as to how the literature
awards do/do not align with more empirical fields?... sure, we all know
that lit. tends to be, on the surface of it, a more subjective category...
or does it?... i mean, is there a common denominator at work in the nobels,
one that presumably seeks out, say, the Good... regardless how political
all the awards may be de facto, what i'm asking about here is whether and
how a meta-category (say, the Good) is distributed across the award
spectrum...

(2) this relates to jordan's question to me (loaded as hell!---but thanx
jord, we need to be provoked so) about what makes for a bad langpoem (and
will *somebody* please forgive me this shorthand)... i teach tech. writing,
and as i just posted a list member backchannel, i tend to focus these days
in my classes, as a sort of historical backdrop, on the distinction between
good tech. writing that's designed (literally) for beneficial ends and good
tech. writing that's not... that is, the latter writing might be
proficient, expeditious, and so forth, but may be used in the service of
BAD ethics, morals, politics... so mebbe, in fact, it's BAD (and there are
surely places and people who would say so---which raises the issue of good
and bad as these relate to culture and community)... in particular, my
classes examine the national socialist rhetoric of wwii (we build on a
remarkable essay that appeared some time ago in _college english_ (march
1992), steven katz's "the ethics of expediency:  classical rhetoric,
technology, and the holocaust")...   in short:  if i can take my tech.
writers, and tech. writing in general, to task for not owning up to its
complicity in a rhetorical bracketing of ethics-morals-politics (have a
look at the stc ethical code) while promoting some technical-technologized
"good," why then i suppose, i should hold poetry so accountable... and
certainly with an understanding that poetry (whatever it is) doesn't work
the same way, hence that poetic 'accountability' is not going to work the
same way... and  with the recognition that some poetries seem to be more
easily held accountable (why is this?), which is not to say that they're
less demanding necessarily...

i'm posing questions here for which i have no easy answers... but of course
the question of the good is not simply formal---and in any case, formal
issues, as many would argue, do in fact lend themselves to matters of
social un/desirability, esp. when viewed against various norms...

Hi Libbie --

Though I can't find WCW's original statement on the sonnet, your question
gives me an opportunity to bring up WCW's later comment on the form, which
everyone seems to have forgotten, and which significantly modifies his
earlier opinion. This is from a letter to James Laughlin dated Jan. 23,
1938. The comment follows WCW's expression of admiration for the sonnets of
Merrill  Moore:

"The sonnet, I see now, is not a form at all but a state of mind. It is the
extremely familiar dialogue upon which much writing is founded: a statement
then a rejoinder of a sort, perhaps a reply, perhaps a variant of the
original -- but a comeback of one sort or another...I never had the
intelligence to realize that it wasn't the sonnet that was at fault but the
bad artists who wrote in the form that were the calamity. The imagination
rescues us all but how difficult to realize the simplest formulations until
someone, some ONE, liberates us. Now sonnets can be written again."

This is from pages 25-26 of the _Selected Letters_ of WCW to Laughlin,
published by Norton in 1989.

Take care,

Subject:      what's a good poem

OK, I've been a lurker for a while.

On dismissal:  I'm quite suspicious of it, particularly when it involves
intergenerational activity. It is not necessary to dismiss poets you don't
find useful.  Just ignore them.

Underlying the whole Nobel thread is the frustration of experimental poets at
not having access to the insitutions with tremendous culural capital.  We want
wider distribution and exposure. Mainstream newspapers and intellectual
publications ignore us in favor of the Heaneys et al of this world.  We want
some of that largesse for ourselves. We want experimentalism to be more
central to cultural life.

What would that mean, socio/politically/economically, to have experimentalism
at the core?  Perhaps a look at the visual art world through much of the 20th
century would give an answer.  `Tain't a pretty sight.  Any other ideas?

So why do we rail?  (And I rail as much as anyone.  Yesterday at lunch I
explained why the mainstream Erdrich was inferior to the nonmainstream Young
Bear, and not a few weeks earlier I had denounced Heaney to the same
colleague.) If major cultural capital brings with it the grotesque wheeling
and dealing and imaging-making that we see in the artworld, who needs it?
Visual artists that I know are all appalled by their position relative to the
image-makers.

Would experimental poetry, if given major support, be different?  Probably.
Innovation in visual arts is tightly tied to marketing and niche-making.
There is not enough of a market in poetry to sell mainstream stuff, let alone
experimental.  Perhaps experimental could get more capital without changing.
Dunno.

Maybe this is why I don't post a lot:  I dunno.

As far as what I like in a poem, language or otherwise:  Challenge. I want it
to stretch my mind.  Sometimes this is historical:  why did someone write this
in 1432?  Sometimes it is based on figurative language:  where do the
metaphors lead me?  Sometimes it's the sound of the piece:  can I give words
to such a feeling?  how is such a sensation created?  Sometimes it is based on
a weird pull, a sense that the poem is uttering a significance for my life
that I cannot articulate. Sometimes I know the poet and wonder why he or she
would write this from what I know of the givens of biography.

I want poetry that provides me an opportunity for mental calisthenics.

I propose a new prize.  The POETICS LIST MENTAL CALISTHENICS POET OF THE YEAR.

Dig it.

I don't know much about Marsden, but Mariani's bio of WCW mentions a
long piece of hers called "Lingual Psychology" that was serialized in
The Egoist.  WCW critiqued the piece in a long letter to the mag that
was printed over two successive issues.  All this around 1917.

You raise a good point, Gary. Mebbe I shld have sd "tends to ratify." All
the examples you mention are "exceptions" and one could add more. (I think).
But for every Paz or Montale there seem to be ten Jaroslav Sieferts (the WS
of his day?). Taking it farther back, why give the prize to Kipling  and not
to Conrad? What about Joyce, Woolf, Pound, WCW? Why has a US poet never won?
We could beat this thing to death and maybe we have. At bottom I suppose it
all comes down to the fact that hierarchies (of whatever kind)  always breed
resentment. On the other hand, I like Henry's notion that's it all just part
of the circus...

Of course, prizes are the devil's blessing, but I am unsure whether the
"status quo" argument is accurate.  Beckett is indeed a major exception,
but then again, who would deny his importance?  What about Claude Simone
and Octavio Paz?  These recent winners are not exactly "status quo" and
have direct ties to avant-gardism.  Going a little further back, what about
Neruda and Montale?  Sure they're safe enough now, but that wasn't always
the case.  I know that quibbling about a roster is not really getting to
the heart of the poetic issues necessarily raised by this year's selection,
but I thought maybe the ambiguous examples I have cited would complicate
the tendency to think of the prize as only going to the Pearl Bucks of the
world.

Sound and meaning? I'm not sure that's sufficiently complex. Frinstance
what about syntax, which is a simultaneous structuring of sound and meaning
that isn't particularly affected by word choice or intended meaning? I'm
also worried that putting 'sound and meaning' up front that way will lead
to the [what's the right word here? privileging? valorization?
winning-of-awards? ratification! that's it, dirty ratification] of one
particular kind of sound, as the perennial victory of the absurd
squish-writers has shown. I'd hate it if everybody tried to write like
Clark Coolidge --- wait maybe they did and it was the 80s -- even though to
my ear parts of _Solution Passage_ sound as good as anything else.

My understanding of anonymity in Russian poetry is that one had to be
anonymous because one had to be anonymous. I would hate to feel that
necessity, and I would hate to emulate the behavior of people who felt that
necessity. To have a name is not so bad. Each one works out where they are
on the axis of comfortable / cautious. The trend always seems to tip back
towards cautious during even the most predictable election year -- fast

I think the National Poetry Foundation did just that for Robert Duncan in
1984/5 after so little attention had been paid to Duncan's "Ground Work I".
I think the cash award came from donations from poet/critic signers of the
certificate.

I think this was discussed in the Duncan Sagetrieb issue. I don't have it
at hand so I may have misremembered some details.

I agree, though, that prizes as an ongoing annual "event" are a cheap way
to deal with culture. Or Culture.

I'll agree with you there.  Sounds like a textbook: "Sound & Meaning:
Poetry for Hungry 9th Grade Ears".  & I liked Jefferson's post too.
He mentioned something about how the sound creates a new or hard-to-grasp
feeling, that said it better.  But if you want complexity I think the
sound & meaning have to work together with the syntax, maybe not in
lockstep, but... it IS affected by vocabulary & meaning.  Ashbery & his
disciples like to disconnect them, create fake rhetorics... I used to
like it but now find it sort of boring.

I'm thinking of it more in terms of the various literary effects of
anonymity.  I think French poets get at it pretty well.  Villon,
Corbiere, even Laforgue - they achieve this kind of "Everyman" quality -
the poem stands on the exact borderline between folksong and art song -
the writer gets lost in Anonymous.  Or there's a fusion of the individual
and Anonymous.  This works on a lot of levels.  Not to advertise too much
but I wrote an essay that gets into this called "School of Anonymous"
in the latest Nedge. I wouldn't call it caution - to write like Anonymous
is not something for the cautious.  More like a kind of negative capability.

If the opposite of anonymity is identity (the textual kind if anyone wants
to know) then we valorize both anonymity and identity when we experience
them as oppositional and liberating.  So particular writing procedures are
probably context dependent in this sense.  Syntax is as always a
particularly generative area to investigate because more obviously than
the easily metaphorized squishyness of sound (and what could be squishier
than meaning) syntax is a braid or torque or juxtaposition that involves
self and other in an active deployment: syntax is social.

(including but not limited to distortions) of syntax are social too.
No one kind of syntactical procedure should be assigned the same social
valence always and everywhere but trends are audible and worth differing
over as we invent and reinvent.

I do not mean trends as in trendy but rather well if Shlovsky says thus
and such about parataxis and Bernstein agrees that describes a trend as
opposed to a closed system.  Shared but not universal facts.

Joseph --
you're right that squishiness is context-dependent -- I'm thinking mainly
of the squish-poets' tendency to make lugubrious every process they
encounter, as if everything were a fen. That's probably incorrect grammar,
but if syntax is social, is bad grammar the residuum of individuality that
we have to preserve?

I know what I meant by a distortion of syntax but looking back over what I
wrote a few minutes ago I wish I could retract that phrase: I don't mean
to imply a norm from which distortions etc. but I do think that ordinary
language in the sense of ordinary language philosophy allows for the
establishing of language games which recognize distortions.  The same
could be said for realism (I mean realism the way Silliman, Watten,
Hejinian do and the way that tradition can be said to start in Whitman,
Dickinson, and Thoreau).  Realism as a constructivist narrativity grounded
in fact.  Syntax one of the motions.

To get back to anonymity: there's a perfect example of what I was talking
about with regard to the French, in Dan Bouchard's new magazine, MASS AVE.
It's called "Matrix Blues", by Giovanni Singleton.  It's not a
narrativity memo from a de-centered slave-subject of the po-squish
zitgeist.  It's all Anonymous & all Giovanni Singleton, simultaneously.

call for papers

The Department of Literatures in English at Rutgers University, New
Brunswick announces

Poetry and the Public Sphere:  a conference on contemporary poetry,
April 24-27, 1997

Scheduled to partcipate:  Adrienne Rich, Robert Hass, Sonia Sanchez,
Miguel Algarin, Poets from the Nuyorican Poets' Cafe, Charles
Bernstein, Tricia Rose, Charles Altieri, Maria Damon, Alicia Ostriker,
Cheryl Clarke, Michael McKeon, Elin Diamond, Abena Busia, and many others.

This interdisciplinary conference is open to the public and aims to
provide new understandings of poetry's participation in the public
sphere.   The last two decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest
in public poetry--readings, festivals, performances, films, television
series, and poetry slams.  In examining the way poetry affects and is affected
by social context, we will consider a range of contemporary poetries in their
public settings, including performance-oriented, community-based, socially
engaged, and formally experimental work.  Questions of audience and
aesthetics will be central to our discussion of poetry's active role in
building, defining, questioning, and motivating social and political
communities.  The conference will feature poetry readings and
performances, keynote lectures, and panel presentations by a wide
range of poets, scholars, and activists.

We welcome submissions from anyone with an interest in poetry.  We
are currently accepting:

Detailed two-page proposals for 15-minute papers, not limited to
the topics below.  (Feel free to suggest panel topics; however, we are
not accepting group panel proposals at this time.)

Detailed proposals for roundtable discussions (no more than four
people), to consist of five-minute remarks and a moderated discussion.
You may provide participant names or make suggestions.  Please
provide names and brief profiles of chair and 3-4 panelists, plus a two-page
proposal describing the topic, approach, and intended contribution of
each discussant.

  poetry and social movements
  poetics of performance poetry
  politics of form
  poetry and public sphere theory
  poetry as witness
  poetry and community activism
  African American poetry
  poetry slams
  ethnography and poetry
  poetry and popular culture
  global poetry
  Latino/a poetry

I simply want to thank everyone for all those wonderful and really
encouraging get-well messages and sympathy -- it's amazing, such messages
really do help. And I am clearly, now, on the road to full recovery -- minor
surgery turned into major life-threatening systemic infection, but massive
i.v antibiotics for a week stemmed the tide. So I feel like a rather
exhausted but successful Canute, and am slowly catching up on all my
delinquencies.
And again I send my heartfelt thanks to you all.

Among others, Marsden published Williams, who in The Egoist for August 1917
published "The Great Sex Spiral: A Criticism of Miss Marsden's 'Lingual
Psychology.'" This and related matters are thoroughly discussed in Bruce
Clarke's really excellent book  _Dora_Marsden_and_Early_Modernism_:_Gender,

Peter,

It's good to know that you will be with us for a few more decades.
We're counting on it.

I do hope that the meaning of Life (& Time) is not the same as the
meaning of Sports Illustrated.

Or even of M/E/A/N/I/N/G


All best,

Jeff,

In this world there are those of us who think that the experience of
reading should be like weightlifting, an exercise that can be felt as
such and which leaves us all the stronger for it. And then there are
those (in the majority) who think it should be like watching
television, transparent and "painless." Frost was for the latter, and
that is why he was a "bad person."

funny, i never thought of weightlifting as an analogue for the reading
experience. wonder why not.  and then some of us think that the experience of
reading should be like having a conversation with a smart and or trusted friend
or stranger: challenging, revealing, transformative.  or maybe weightlifting w/
the friend as weight.  now there's a promising potential for revelation,
transformation, challenge.

Subject:      The Book, Spiritual Instrument / The Word Made Flesh

Granary Books announces two new publications:

1)-THE BOOK, SPIRITUAL INSTRUMENT edited by Jerome Rothenberg & David Guss.

The Book, Spiritual Instrument addresses the "ethnopoetics of the book."
Originally published as New Wilderness Letter #11 in 1982 and now long
out-of-print, this newly designed edition contains all of the original
material along with a new preface by Jerome Rothenberg.

Contents include: "Le Livre, Instrument Spirituel" by  St=E9phane Mallarm=E9=
,
translated and visually interpreted by Michael Gibbs; "The Book and the
Desert/[Wilderness]" an interview with Edmond Jab=E8s, translated by Jack
Hirschman; "The Book as an Instrument of Performance" Becky Cohen's
fold-out section of photographs of poets reading from their work; Alison
Knowles & George Quasha on The Book of Bean; "A Book" by Dick Higgins;
selections from the Popul Vuh with translation and commentary by Dennis
Tedlock; plus works by Karl Young, David Meltzer, Tina Oldknow, J. Stephen
Lansing, Eduardo Calder=F3n, David Guss, Jed Rasula, Paul Eluard, Gershom
Scholem and Herbert Blau.

The Book, Spiritual Instrument is a welcome and important contribution to
discussions of poetics, book art and performance.

"Prefaced by Mallarm=E9's famous dictum that 'everything in the world exists
in order to end up as a book,' this spirited collection demonstrates the
reverse as well: everything in the book exists in order to end up in the
world. . . In a series of exemplary essays on, and demonstrations of, what
might be called the ethnopoetics of the book, books from a wide range of
cultural traditions are portrayed as radical extenders of form rather than
neutral vessels of content. The result is a vision of  books as
laboratories for the invention and performance of perceptual systems: new
worlds carved out of the wilderness of human thought and language."
-Charles Bernstein, Poet, Editor and David Gray Professor of Poetry and
Poetics, SUNY-Buffalo.

Designed by Diane Bertotlo. Paperback, smythe sewn, 160 pages, illustrated
throughout with black & white photographs. ISBN 1-887123-08-3
Price: $21.95 plus $6.00 shipping (domestic) / NY residents add appropriate
sales tax

2)-THE WORD MADE FLESH by Johanna Drucker

Calling attention to the visual materiality of the text, this book attempts
to halt linear reading, trapping the eye in a field of letters which make a
complex object on the page. The writing refers continually to the visceral
character of language, literalizing metaphors of tongue,breath, and flesh.
The work both embodies and discusses language as a physical form, one whose
properties cannot be ignored by arriving at a disembodied content.

"Unlike the avant-garde artist's book of the early century, Drucker's
doesn't boast a single illustration, a single pictorial equivalent to the
text. Rather, it is the alphabet itself that is made flesh, the letter
being seen in all its visual potential, as if to say that, desensitized as
we are by the endless billboard discourse around us, we have almost
forgotten the astonishing power of the alphabet to create human meanings."

Subject:      "Death in a Landslide" in New York this week (fwd)

Anyone in the city seen this?  gab.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
I thought I would pass on this message from Jay Martel, one of
the writers of TV Nation and most recently, the writer of the play
"Death in a Landslide" which is in New York this week.

Dear Friends,

 I need your help in getting the word out as soon as possible
about "Death in a Landslide," a new comedy. The show opened
last weekend to fantastic response but the odds are that the play
has two more weeks of life and then goes away forever. Given
these dire circumstances, I want the largest number of people
to see it as possible. Even if you're not in the New York area or
are unable to make the show OR have already seen it, I would
greatly appreciate your help in forwarding the following couple
paragraphs to five e-mail buddies who might be able to come:

"Death in a Landlside" is a play about what happens when Death
comes for Cuff Riley, the slickest political operator in Washington.
In a bargain that's part "Faust," part "Frankenstein," Death spares
Cuff in exchange for Death getting a shot at the presidency.  In
other words, Cuff Riley goes where Lee Atwater would have--if he
could have. By far the strangest independent presidential candidate
since Ross Perot, Death hits the campaign trail with a pro-gun,
pro-capital punishment, pro-death-pro-life platform that charms
conservatives, splinters liberals, and gives a whole new meaning
to the concept of "scare tactics."  Using campaign slogans like
"Death: For a Change" and  "Give us Liberty AND give us Death,
" Cuff Riley uses every trick in his bag to elect a Force of Nature
president and, of course, gets more than he bargained for.

The show stars Chuck Montgomery (Hal Hartley's "Amateur")
and Joseph McKenna (Terry Gilliam's "Twelve Monkeys"), was
directed by Kirk Jackson (Cucaracha's "Viva Las Vegas"), written
by Jay Martel, and co-produced by Michael Moore and Kathleen
Glynn ("T.V. Nation," "Roger and Me").

"Death in a Landslide" runs for only two more weeks,  beginning
at 8:00 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday, from now until October
 20th at the Grove Street Playhouse (39 Grove Street in the Village,
west of Bleecker and Seventh Ave.). Tickets are $12. For more
information and reservations call 726-8142.

Thanks, Jay

Taking your lead to look beyond the Nobel Prize for Literature, let's look
at prizes within the arts in general, rather than to the Nobels in general.
(I don't see The Good in revisiting territory previously covered in the
lengthy discussions of the Sokol essay in Social Text, but maybe that's
just me.)

Looking at any award system, I think you'll find the common denominator is
not The Good, but rather The Opinion, a very different philosophical
category. Especially when The Opinion comes from a committee. In this case,
The Opinion of what's good usually has to do with the social dynamics of
who's on the panel, who selected them, etc.

There are very few selection committees for prizes, grants, fellowships,
etc. with a mandate to value innovation in the arts across the board. Cf.
Appendix 7 of Jed Rasula's American Wax Museum for some poetically relevant
details. It's not much better in other genres, in some it may be worse.

Subject:      Re: nobels, the Good, here we go...

Abstracting the argument away from good and bad innovative poems to Good
and Bad innovative poems doesn't address the same problem. Especially in
the context of an article on expedience, rhetoric, accountability, &
complicity with the Holocaust and concept-matrices like
"ethics-morals-politics".

I think many (though not all) on the list would agree that there can be bad
innovative poems that are not Evil. However, I expect few list members will
be willing to go on record with their specific choices for this category. &
that's the real problem with looking for a definition of a "bad innovative
poem" on this list. Most people who have the chops to make the distinctions
feel uncomfortable doing so in such a public forum. The field is too small
for that kind of public in-fighting. & this list is even smaller, though
more public.

Perhaps when a "mainstream" writer or critic says something like "but you
experimental writers just support each others work, making little critical
distinction among writers at the same career levels" or some such, the best
response is to say "yes, it looks VERY familiar, doesn't it?"

Herb -- interesting that THIS paragraph would appear shortly after a cogent
paragraph by you about Good v. Opinion, a case long since settled out of
Court.

I would like to go record as saying most poems are both bad and Evil,
with the caveat that the remainders are unlikely to be both good and
Good--just at a lower cost and found in a bin at your local bookstore.

In-Reply-To:  <199610090405.AAA28199@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu>

Re the erudite eds at American Book Review:

I don't know what's happening to the OCR software in
Normal, Illinois, but my short-short review of Darius James's
_That's Blaxploitation!_ got obscured by a stonehenge
of em-dashes, double parentheses, bulgingly balanced sentences
and improvisatory spellings. Though ABR's proofreaders are
usually fastidious, I somehow got translated into what can only
be described as Prig Latin: I read like some harumphing disembrained
polyglot in a tome by Oliver Sachs! Indeterminists, take note: a
good time can be read by (A=E5hhhll<)>. To all others,
I say: Buy Darius James's book and the rest will make sense.

BTW: In the same issue of ABR, there is another review
that I must recommend: "Legend and Language," Marjorie Perloff's
illuminating look at the neglected (but resurrected) Mina Loy.
And guest-editor Larry McCaffery is his usual selfless self,
breathlessly promoting neglected writers like an Ezra Pound
on meth. (McCaffery's an angel; I just wish there were more
like him.)

Anyhow, back to work on an album with the Scottish band, Truth.
I just laid out my own book, _Distorture_, for Black Ice Books,
due in March, 1997: a labor for the anal, it's true, but I'm
thrilled that the publishers gave me that kind of artistic control.
Respect for authorial aesthetics? Nothing normal about that.

All the best,

Subject:      Re: nobels, the Good, here we go...

herb, all points well-taken... still, i'll press a bit and say that i think
the question of good/Good bad/Bad is worth continued navigation in these
parts (and i know neither of us means The Good), albeit i admit to being
somewhat at a loss as to how to proceed... and in part for the reasons you
mention about the nature of this public forum...

really, i hate to keep coming back to this issue, but if in fact it's the
forum itself that's preventing such dialogue, why then there's the need to
reflect on same... what is it about that complex [wink] of
ethico-moral-political that's untouchable around here?...

i might make the argument (as i have on occasion) that certain attitudes
about poetry or poetics are irresponsible when it comes to their
institutional embodiment... now as a teacher, the institutional is
relatively easy for me to access (in such terms, i mean)... but even poets
and writers with no professional obligations or commitments to teaching
must readily acknowledge that what they advocate as poets and writers have
institutional effects that are more and less desirable... i regret, for
example, those three nobel laureate poets (i think it was walcott, paz, and
milosz) who together proclaimed their opposition to electronic media, an
attitude that i find not only lamentable and compromising to more
innovative work, but in fact aiding and abetting print hegemonies from
which all three of these gents' work *might* be said to profit directly...

of course emedia is my hobbyhorse... and of course this question of the
Good i raise is specifically one having to do with inter-poetic, if not
inter-media, struggle (sorta)... but if you find yourself linking your
effort as a poet or scholar or teacher with broader social concerns, why
then the Good will of necessity be ramified across many other domains...

anyway, i'd like to hear more...

best,

Sorry, I don't have the essay and I don't have a note of the name of
the writer, and I would be extremely reluctant to post it anyway, as
initially a private communication and in confidence.

If the student had been someone
on this list and willing or able to discuss the essay herself in her
own terms, ,on equal terms, maybe then.

I think it would be difficult or obnoxious to expose the writer
herself to view, as an object of linguistic curiosity. The questions
 raised by non-standard writings in supposedly standardised and
standardising environments is the issue that I'm concerned with and
my reason for citing the essay in the first place.

Subject:      Re: Englishes/Latins

Yes, Michael Boughn, I cd elaborate a little.
But I am in a state of some confusion over what is happening.

I've just come from a
small group tutorial "on" Watteau. The little group of three older
women arrive together (Anglo-Scottish, Irish) one young Chinese
woman, who cannot be persuaded to say anything, one
exceedingly shy young man and one tall blond young woman,
Anglo-Scottish, whatever, and for the first time this whole semester
which is now finishing, four young women, Polynesian and quite
various in appearance.

 The assumptions of a teacher of European art history as to
the audience's assumptions and what it takes for granted culturally
are no longer operative in this situation. Chinoiserie is something to
 pause over --, so is the appearance of persons of colour in paintings
 by Watteau or Rubens, though that has not been an issue yet --  but
 the styles of dress and makeup of Watteau's imaginary figures of courting
 couples is emphatic about the whiteness of the skin of the young women's
 bosoms.

 How does that sound and look to the Polynesian women?

As for their writing, what is expected of them? What do they expect of
 themselves? I am looking for possibilities of encouraging them to ask their own
questions about the artworks they are looking at and in the language
they have available to them. Is this naive of me, is this altogether
going in the wrong direction? Should I be encouraging them to appear
the same as all the other students, as if cultural difference did
not enter into the equation? Consequently "grading papers" becomes a
more complicated task than usual, when it is clear that cultural
differences are making themselves felt in the language.

I have met this before with one or two students in a class, but now
about a third of my second year class is not European in its cultural
expectations and I feel the need to adjust what I do, but I am unsure
how to do it.

I have a strong suspicion that it requires the university as a whole, or
 at least the humanities teachers to take action as a group, and that anything
I do to encourage non-standard writing may get the students concerned into
 deep trouble with other teachers.

Subject:      weightlifting

Ron (and all):

Reading should be like weightlifting because it makes you a stronger
person??!??!

So a complex text = Popeye's spinach, lo how the muscle bulges.  Ketjak as
Charles Atlas course.

Ugh.

I wouldn't say I'm one of that select group of people who believes so, no.
But I recently read a book about the emotional lives of animals and learned
the word "funktionslust" -- the enjoyment of one's capabilities, i.e. the
pleasure a cat takes in climbing trees or a monkey in swinging from branch
to branch.  Maybe I like to read tough things because I can, and that
pleasure is its own reward, not the great macho overweaning ectomorphic
forehead brain muscle that will develop because I made the exertion. And if
it does, I'll just have to wear a scarf or something.

Although I do like spinach, I don't eat it primarily because it's good for me.

And speaking of lust -- I know the battery fell out of the dildo thread
long ago, but I found this bit in Philip Whalen's On Bear's Head last
night. NB this is not a hoax, look it up for yourselves, p. 376:

Not sure what thread I'm getting into here, but as someone who has always
had some trouble understanding why heaney was taken so seriously, who found
his work unatisfying on various levels although I understood somewhat why
he was taken up as he was, I do want to pass on a small story that partly
ties in to Tony Green's talk about various 'englishes.' A colleague in
Post-Colonial studies also plays in a small group that does mostly Irish
(Celtic) folk music around Edmonton in various bars where the irish in town
gather. Heaney's brother lives here so he visits upon occasion. The last
time he was here, the announcer told the audience he was in the place &
everyone gave him a standing ovation, after he was introduced as a poet who
spoke for them all. So: Eavan Boland probably has many valid points against
such rhetoric as his, but.... Further unto this, my friend said that the
Irish woman in the group, who is not an "English" type, bu which he meant
she did not study literature, was trying to explain to him the various
'codes' operative whenever a catholic & protestant met, finally threw up
her hands & said, "I cant explain, but listen," picked a copy of heaney's
poems out of her backpack, & read him a poem in which heaney explored
exactly that problem. His point, as he knows I'm not a fan, was that for
his community, heaney does have something important to say. I cannot
disagree, even if I still find most of the poetry only 'interesting,' not
exciting to me.
The first of these could justbe a reaction to 'fame,' but the second
suggests that in fact heaney does speak to & for a particular community.

This ongoing discussion has been fun to follow.

Meanwhile, I too welcome Peter back, even though he was gone before I
joined. It's been a long time since we talked Peter, but I'm glad we still
might be able to the next time I'm in Vancouver...

All the best

Subject:      watteau

Tony,

One of the things that you all could consider in Watteau's paintings is the
role of costumes, ceremony, and interaction rituals.  To use a crit theory buzz
word, his painting are very much about the "performative" aspects of
self-presentation.  Trying as a group to derive a rhetoric and vocabulary of
gestures and signs in his paintings seems like a useful exercise, as long as
you don't have a predetermined list that you are trying to get the group to
guess.   How are emotional states, for example, alluded to or signified by the
surface features of the human figures and their settings/backgrounds?  How
outlandish are they from your perspectives?  Is racial whiteness a staged
property/a stage prop in his work?  It seems that the familiar conflation of
make-up (for clowns and women, say) and oil paint for pictures is also at play
here.   How could non-European readers of Watteau's paitings (or even the
something like the photos of Cindy Sherman) relate to or criticize the cultural
work of masking and unmasking?

As for writing, it seems to me that you might need to determine if you and the
rest of the group accept any analogies between the kind of dynamic social
self-presentation in the images and self-presentation in writing framed by
institutional settings.

of em-dashes, double parentheses, bulgingly balanced sentences
and improvisatory spellings. Though ABR's proofreaders are
usually fastidious, I somehow got translated into what can only
be described as Prig Latin: I read like some harumphing disembrained
polyglot in a tome by Oliver Sachs! Indeterminists, take note: a
good time can be read by (A=E5hhhll<)>. To all others,
I say: Buy Darius James's book and the rest will make sense.

BTW: In the same issue of ABR, there is another review
that I must recommend: "Legend and Language," Marjorie Perloff's
illuminating look at the neglected (but resurrected) Mina Loy.
And guest-editor Larry McCaffery is his usual selfless self,
breathlessly promoting neglected writers like an Ezra Pound
on meth. (McCaffery's an angel; I just wish there were more
like him.)

Anyhow, back to work on an album with the Scottish band, Truth.
I just laid out my own book, _Distorture_, for Black Ice Books,
due in March, 1997: a labor for the anal, it's true, but I'm
thrilled that the publishers gave me that kind of artistic control.
Respect for authorial aesthetics? Nothing normal about that.

All the best,

Rob Hardin

Doug,

curious to know which she chose.)

ACCESS TO MATERIALS

This update contains summary information about EMF's website and tells you
how you can receive detailed information by email if you prefer.

We are sending this update to you either because you're already on our list
or because we believe you'll be interested in this information. These
updates will be sent approximately every month. If you would rather not
receive future updates, simply let us know.

If this has been forwarded to you by someone else and you would like to
receive these notices directly, just send an email message to list@emf.org
and say something like "Put me on your list" and we'll put you on our list.

Contents:

1. CDeMUSIC is growing fast
2. The rest of the website
3. Looking for classroom materials?
4. Receiving information by email
5. Partner and sponsor news
6. A few editorial words about our email communications
7. Last call for Charter Subscribers

============================
1. CDeMUSIC is growing fast

CDeMUSIC is fast becoming a worldwide comprehensive and coherent source for
compact discs of non-commercial, experimental, and electronic music. Our
web site lists CDs by composer's name as well as in curated catalogs and
selected organization and company catalogs.

We're now in process of creating a composer's page for every composer, with
links from an alphabetical list. These pages will eventually include all
materials related to that composer's available work. We're starting with
Charter Subscribers and important pioneers in the field (often the same
people). To get an idea of where this is going, click on David Tudor or
Alvin Lucier at

     http://www.emf.org/cde_gencat.html

The curated catalogs currently are 'Pioneers of Electronic Music', 'John
Cage and the New York School', 'A Few Stitches from The Knitting Factory',
'Microtonality', and 'Words and Music'. And several additional catalogs are
in progress. The selected company and organization catalogs currently
include the EMF label, the CDCM computer music series, Wergo's Computer
Music Currents series, the INA/GRM label (Groupe de Recherches Musicales),
North/South Recordings, SEAMUS, and Stockhausen Verlag. This list also will
grow dramatically during the next month. The catalogs can be browsed at

     http://www.emf.org/cde_catalogs.html





Further, a group of 'spotlight' CDs, which will change every ten days or
so, will focus on particular composers and catalogs. The current spotlight
is on the pioneers and includes 'The Historical CD of Digital Sound
Synthesis', Laurie Spiegel's 'Unseen Worlds', and David Tudor's 'Neural
Networks'. Take a look at

     http://www.emf.org/cde_frontdoor.html

We project growth not only in numbers of CDs, but also in the scope of the
collection. In the next month or so, expect to see increasing numbers of
CDs of improvised music and the acoustic avant garde.

============================
2.  The rest of the website

The EMF Worldwide Calendar is updated on a weekly basis and now includes
special features and notices (from IRCAM, CNMAT, The British Harry Partch
Society, to name a few) as well as events listings. Have a look at

     http://www.emf.org/cal_frontdoor.html

Note the pictorial features on David Tudor's and Sophia Ogielska's
'Toneburst' at Wesleyan University, 'Lucier @ 65' (concert coming up in New
York), the 1996 ICMC in Hong Kong in August, and Tod Machover's 'Brain
Opera' as seen in New York in July.

Current offerings in The EMF Store include Iannis Xenakis' 'Formalized
Music', Reynold Weidenaar's 'Magic Music From the Telharmonium', Trevor
Wishart's 'Audible Design', and Luigi Russolo's 'The Art of Noises'. Take a
look at

     http://www.emf.org/store_frontdoor.html

We're also offering 'M', Intelligent Music's interactive composing program,
written by David Zicarelli in 1986. This is a historically important
program that everyone should experience. It takes an hour or two to learn
and it contains a wealth of musical wisdom. The main screen is shown at

     http://www.emf.org/store_m.html

If you're interested in the web, keep checking 'Sites, Sights, and Sounds'
for continuing updates on exceptionally interesting places to visit, a list
of internet electronic music resources, and an electronic music internet
directory which is fast becoming comprehensive.

============================
3. Looking for classroom materials?

Note that there exists a videotape called 'Mastering the Theremin' in which
Lydia Kavina, virtuoso and Leon Theremin's cousin, shows how the theremin
is played. Read the description at

     http://www.emf.org/store_videotheremin.html

and you'll note that the format of the videotape is a series of lessons
moderated by Robert Moog.

This is not, however, only for those who want to learn how to play the
theremin. This is for any and all teachers lecturing in electronic music.
It shows students how this remarkable instrument is played. And btw, don't
forget to listen to the classic compact disc of Clara Rockmore playing the
theremin in concert. It leads the listing in the pioneers catalog at

     http://www.emf.org/cdcat_pioneers.html

============================
4.  Receiving information by email

If you don't have easy access to the web and you'd like to receive any
catalogs, product notices, or other information as email, just send an
email message to EMF@emf.org and tell us what you'd like. We'll do our best
to comply.

============================
5. Partner and sponsor news

Robert Moog, who normally presides at Big Briar, Inc. where he designs
theremins according to Leon Theremin's principles, will be speaking at the
Theremin Center in Moscow on October 14 and 15, and then making
presentations on October 17, 18 and 19 at Musikmassen,
an electronic music festival in Goteborg, Sweden.

Carla Scaletti and Kurt Hebel, inventors of the Kyma System at Symbolic
Sound, will be demonstrating the latest Kyma upgrades in booth 1406 at the
AES show, November 8-11, in Los Angeles.

============================
6. A few editorial words about our email communications

Issues regarding the emailing of this information have occasionally been
raised. And since we agree with those who hold that crowding cyberspace
with ugly commerce is undesirable behavior, we'd like to clarify our
position.

EMF's mission is the dissemination of information and materials about the
history and current practice of electronic music. Dissemination of
information means giving away information. Dissemination of materials means
selling materials. We do both. Our sales, however, are of noncommercial
items not easily found elsewhere. Our sales are not to be confused with a
large-scale commercially motivated operation and our email notices should
not be comfused with a commercial junk-mail infringement of Internet
ethics.

We enlarge our email list partly by requests directly from individuals who
want to receive it, partly by recommendations from others. So if you're
surprised to receive this mailing, well, check it out and simply decide if
you'd like to continue to receive mailings. If not, just let us know.

============================
7. Last call for Charter Subscribers

A Charter Subscriber is someone who has chipped in during our first two
years of existence to help us establish our operations. In exchange for
their support, we offer lifelong professional and consumer benefits,
including preferential access to all of our programs. Note our
distinguished list of current Charter Subscribers at

     http://www.emf.org/emf_csubs.html

Note also that our startup period will end this month. If you're interested
in becoming a Charter Subscriber, please act fast. If you're interested in
knowing more, look at

     http://www.emf.org/emf_invitation.html

or ask us about it by email.

jordan, dodie, i don't know what i want from this list.  perhaps part of the
dull problem is that we have high expectations.  & also it's as difficult to
say anything interesting about poetry as it is to write a good poem.  also we
are afraid of saying anything interesting because so many people are
listening so we take the form of poetics to be marketing press release.  &
it's not just here.  i've been thinking that all poetics is just marketing.
 it's not necessarily wrong or possible to escape from this, but it's often
dull if not acknowledged & tweeked.  i thought kevin's invite to his play was
fabulous.  i guess i like the announcements the best because they're not
subtle.

also evident of high expectations are what we call the back channel.  i've
never liked the meaning commonly associated with this phrase because i think
this is the back channel here.  i mean what we call the back channel is the
real channel.

I've written a few heavy words in my time.  The heaviest so far is the word
"FOLKS" which was made out of bricks as part of a piece for the Convergence II
festival in Providence, RI in 1989.  It weighed 5 tons.  After the festival
someone in the parks department made a patio out of it.

I usually write words in the 100 to 200 pound range.  They're far more
commonplace, but they're easier to lift.

Hello list

Two fast notes in total haste (my whole life is total haste these days!) to say
---THANK YOU for resurrecting Ron Johnson; been meaning to send fan mail
myself and thought, for a minute there, I'd lost my chance.

ARK and Living Batch books (including his Southwest Cooking book) are
distributed through Univ. of New Mexico Press-- I think it was Charles
Alexander who sent this post via the list to me, when I was trying to get a
hold of ARK.  Any good local bookstore, in other words, shld be able to get
it for you.  Heck I even shamed the local B&N into carrying it & placing a
copy in the window.  Backchannel me for good sources of o.p. Johnson stuff.

As for Marsden, I'm surprised no one's trotted out my favorite anecdote
about her--
how she waited all night on the roof of Parliament, for the right moment to
call down through the circular opening in the dome and heckle (I think)
Winston Churchill about suffrage:  "What about the women, Mr. Churchill?"
They were all over her like the bomb squad on luggage.

It's in the biography.

ciao-- Marisa

Bouchard 8, Mills 9 at Poetry City

Time: B (27 mins), M (40 mins)
Attendance: 20

Opening day at Poetry City, the Mayor threw out the first ball, "MASS AVE"
editor Bouchard was in good form, loose, built up with six shorter pieces
to his longer work "August." Early line drives--"Make way for the
language," "If you'd like to make a speech, press pound now," "for lack of
what is Pound there," "ampersand ampersand ampersand." A rally in the third
as Bouchard riffed on the last line of the Maximus Poems, "My wife my car
my color my credit rating..." Titles of poems: "A Pavement Ontology,"
"Hesiod's Notebook," "Ben's Release," "Purple Finch," and "Washington
Square." Bouchard was wearing tan bucks, a green-brown sweater, blue jeans
and a watch. His poems are political, because as he put it, he could avoid
political concerns as much as he could avoid the fact that it's snowing.
Shaking off a cold and the ride in from Boston, Bouchard read eight poems
coolly.

David Mills, a teacher in the T&W program, read nine poems, drawing
significant guffaws from the mostly Subpoetics crowd with lines like "I'm
gonna call Dick Gregory," "Our stepfather who art in Macon County," and
"One must be at least an octoroon on this ride." In a zipped-up fleece
jacket, black jeans, black shoes, Mills, whose subject matter ranged from
the topical (Clarence Thomas, oral sex, cross-country car trips) to the
almost purely rhythmic, Mills was a captivating eccentric stage presence.
Titles included: "North Rim," "Great Adventure," "Back Space Talking," and
"Strangers in Paradise."

A brief post-game wrap-up at Poetry City was followed by a brisk walk to
the Cedar in the cold. Too crowded. Half the audience of the reading went
to the Old Town, where if you want to get what they do, get the hamburger.
The shepherd's pie isn't bad but...

(In attendance at the reading: Bill Luoma, Douglas Rothschild, Tim Davis,
Judith Goldman, Steven Hall, Marcella Durand, Anna Van Lenten, Tim Griffin,
Anselm Berrigan, and others.)

Sorry, I dont, but I will ask my friend if he recalls the title of the poem
& get back to you. He was telling me this partly because he knew I wasnt a
big fan of Heaney's. As a theoretical type, deeply into post-colonial work,
he considers another Nobel winner the 'best' (? wrong work: he means, I
think, most interesting in terms of what he does) poet in english today:
Derek Walcott. I had read only a few Walcott poems & not thought much one
way or another, but a reading of the _Collected Poems_ did lead me to
somewhat reise my opinion. There is much there, albeit within a tradition I
am not all that interested in, that is fascinating. Sorry for getting off
topic from your request. I will ask.

Chicago Review (Vol. 42, no 1) did just do an issue dedicated to
Johnson.  There is an interesting interview with Johnson by Peter O'Leary
(who some of you may have met at Orono -- I did), an introduction to ARK
by Devin Johnston, enthusiastic remarks on the work by Thom Gunn and
Robert Creeley, two sections of ARK, and a prose piece ("Hurrah for
Euphony") by Johnson.

Patrick:

I hope my missive didn't seem dismissive: ABR is great,
and I wouldn't want to put it down in any way. I have only
known the staff at ABR to be fastidious, and my James piece
was really a kind of prolonged blurb for his work, which I
feel is frequently overlooked. Had my piece been longer or
more serious, I might have been genuinely upset; still, it
is never a good idea to sound like a hydropcephaloid in an
academic publication.

Sorry to hear about Romayne Rubinas's departure. I'm certain
that Paula will do fine once she settles in (if she hasn't
already).

Still,  really didn't mean to complain about
ABR. I only wanted people to understand that I'm not
a careless or illiterate writer, which is what I appear
to be in my swift, pithed, and formerly pithy piece.

(Also: I'm never faxing *anything* to *any* publication ever again.)

All the best,

Subject:      How To Not Read

Robert Potts's review of Iain Sinclair's CONDUCTORS OF CHAOS (Picador)
appeared in the Times Literary Supplement of 20 September 1996.  I just got
around to reading the review--which bears the lurid title "The blood-soaked
perimeter"--this morning.

The single non-ideological claim that I can reconstruct from the full-page,
four-column review is this: "There is a book."

This afternoon, when I should have been doing any number of other things, I
found myself thinking of Potts's review.  It struck me that such a pure
example of xenophobic reading doesn't come along everyday, and so I set
about writing through the review, trying not to overlook any of its moves.

Since the review was in a manifest state of non-relation to anything like
the objective fact of CONDUCTORS OF CHAOS I decided to go along with Potts
(and Husserl) and just bracket the "thing-itself" entirely.  That is,
rather than address the numerous distortions at the level of empirical
fact, I thought I would concentrate on what this person took to be "the
case."  To better watch the way his claims (implicit and explicit) worked,
I tried to substitute abstract terms for as many of the particular elements
as I could.  (In cases where I couldn't bring myself to "abstract" I left
the term in between brackets.)

The review is broken into two parts, each of which begins with an oversized
drop-cap.  There are eleven paragraphs in all, to which the numbered
sections of my comments correspond.


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


HOW NOT TO READ

There is a book.


I.

1.  There is a book.  But the book does not know (or will not say) what
kind of book it really is.  The reviewer is in a position to clarify the
matter.  The book is an anthology.

There is a group.  But the group does not know (or will not say) that it is
a group.  The reviewer, though not a member of any group himself, can tell
a group when he sees one.

The group has brought upon itself its own marginality.  The reviewer likes
to say this while engaged in the application of all the techniques of
marginalization known to him.

The editor's project in this book is not original.  Having suppressed what
is novel about the editor's project in an earlier sentence, the reviewer
can now charge him with lack of originality.  It does not help that the
reviewer can think of one other project that also did not deny the
existence of experimental writing.

The group is fearful, idiosyncratic, and sectarian.  The reviewer is
fearless, normal, disinterested.  The group is shy, insular, distrustful.
The reviewer is gregarious, open, without worry because without sin.  The
group has for a long time been complacent and self-absorbed.  The
reviewer's ethnographic gaze provides "a fresh and foreign" look at the
group's essential truth.

2.  The writers whom the editor has brought together in his book know that
one another exist.  The reviewer takes exception to such effrontery.
Certain specific writers go so far as to respect other specific writers.
The review knows this to be communism.  Though united in their
anti-capitalist practice of respect for one another and for writing, these
writers apparently find it unnecessary to think that they are all writing
the same thing.  The reviewer is familiar with what passes for intelligence
at [Cambridge].

3.  The group that does not know itself to be a group is the [X] School.
The reviewer will maintain this fact in the face of all evidence,
subjective and objective.

There is a writer in the book who is forthright.  The reviewer pauses to
commend this virtue otherwise so little in evidence in the present volume.
This forthright writer once attempted to address the fact that writing he
recognizes as having value has existed for quite a while and in many
places.  The reviewer regrets that this writer chose the insular venue of a
little magazine in order to make his remarks; still, the reviewer likes a
writer who will name names and spell out the complex internal workings of
this arcane and hostile group whose conspiratorial reach cannot be
overstated.

The group has pursued its agenda with grim determination in [X] and in [Y].
The reviewer takes this opportunity to warn members of the bourgeoisie in
each of these high-risk areas to take measures against the theft of their
speaking voices.

4.  Some of the writers in the book have a critique of speech-based
poetics.  Some/others also seem to have read [Rimbaud].

The highly organized ring of voice-thieves, numbering more than thirty,
have undertaken voluntarily and arbitrarily an agenda of "willed
incoherence," but some (well over half) will their incoherence to a greater
degree than do others (the other half).  The reviewer makes an important
distinction here between the otherwise delightful practice of ripping out
the vocal chords of bourgeois poets and the same practice taken to "hideous
extremes."

Some of the writers in the book have found it possible to read other poems
composed in the twentieth-century.  The reviewer takes this opportunity to
remind his readers of such oddities and atrocities as "open field" and
"(post)modern" poetics and, that most recent aberration,
["L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E"] poetry.

Some of the writers in the book can give reflexive accounts of their aims.
Some also are accustomed to reading the reflexive accounts given by others.
The reviewer is living proof that pausing to reflect before writing can
introduce serious obstacles to facile expression.  Some of the writers in
the book do not imagine their readership to be incapable of complex
thought-processes.  The reviewer cannot understand how these writers mean
to have literary or political success if they are not willing to accept
such basic assumptions as the essential ignorance and laziness of readers
and citizens.

A specific writer in the book has so extended his capacity for reflexivity
that he actually has a critical relationship to an intellectual position he
nonetheless respects.  The reviewer firmly believes that a strict
separation should always be maintained between what one likes and
understands and what one despises and is paid to review in the TLS.

Even this specific writer seems to consider the majority of readers to be
human and to be familiar with the phonemic distinction between "th" and
"dr," as in the words "think" and "drink."  The reviewer avails himself of
the opportunity to call his reader a horse while vouching for the clear
water in his trough.

The specific writer is an intellectual; not surprisingly, then, he remains
committed to certain of the preconditions for reasonable discourse.  The
reviewer praises the writer for not breaking entirely with form, syntax,
and logic.

5.  The specific writer has been preceded in his poetic and intellectual
practice; indeed, one poet and intellectual in particular has shouldered a
great deal of the burden of generating and sustaining interest in the
practices this writer values.  The reviewer wishes that the younger of the
writers could be more discerning with respect to the selection of his
predecessors.

This predecessor makes more than ornamental attempts at transforming the
processes of "meaning."  The reviewer disallows the validity of any
meanings that aren't "clear" upon first reading; he does not mind that no
text valued by his culture meets this criterion.

This predecessor does not rigidly separate cognition from emotion, thinking
perhaps that the expansion of one cannot but expand the other.  The
reviewer expects to be compensated in pleasure for every meaning he passes
up; no arrests to date.

The predecessor has a body of work of tremendous breadth, complexity, and
internal differentiation.  The reviewer extracts the essence of his project
from four cited lines.  Suspicion is once again the posture recommended to
all good people who find themselves in the vicinity of [X].

The same four lines which synopsize a writer's life-work and recommend its
wholesale dismissal can, conveniently, also synopsize and facilitate the
dismissal of the nearly five hundred pages of writing in the book under
review.

6.  Knowing all linguistic acts that don't resolve to clear meaning
instantly upon encounter to be "gobbledygook," the reviewer introduces an
important distinction between strategic "gobbledygook" and that inferior
brand of "gobbledygook" which has devolved into mere "charmless mannerism."

Some of the writers in the book bring the visual dimension of their text to
the foreground; some/others also have grounds for considering the
restriction of meaning to "intention" an intellectual anachronism that did
not survive serious examination in any of the disciplines of the human
sciences that devoted a moment's thought to it.  They might point to
philosophy, linguistics, literary and cultural studies, history, sociology
in making their case.

The reviewer concedes that some private meaning may incidentally attach to
typographical irregularities perpetrated by a given author, but cannot be
brought to consider that a reader could ascertain the nature of this
entirely hermetic experience from the evidence provided by the text.

Some of the writing in the book values surprise, the unexpected, the
spontaneous.  The reviewer is certain that just outside the gates of
narrative regularity awaits total anarchy.

Some of the writers in this volume have detected what seems to them a
worrisome and cloying uniformity in the kinds of messages produced within
the circuits of the dominant, capital-intensive media; some/others think
that poetry needn't reproduce the  structure and content of these messages.
The reviewer reminds his reader once again that these are the sort of
people who forced one to learn a pronunciation of the word "hegemonic."
His verdict upon them is subtly rendered: at least they are not as troubled
as they might be by the "eerie homogeneity of their strings of apparently
meaningless phrases."


II.

7.  The editor in introducing the work he has assembled in this book has
not adopted a tone of smug indifference toward that work.  The reviewer's
own style suggests to no one, surely, the adjectives "rabid and polemical."
The editor passionately argues his poetic position.  The reviewer
considers only dispassionate utterances that presuppose his own assumptions
to be "clear."  The editor's poetics are not merely wrong (a substantive
evaluation) but they even fail on procedural grounds--they are "disguised."

The editor in introducing the work he has assembled in this book has taken
the trouble to foresee, and respond to, a frequent objection made to much
writing of value; namely, that it is (too) difficult.  The reviewer notes
in his opponent's language (and when wasn't the editor of this volume
considered an opponent by this reviewer?) an allusion to a predecessor, but
really lights up when he thinks of another (more recent) predecessor's
retort to that (less recent) predecessor.

The reviewer's preferred predecessor describes the writer/reader
relationship on a contractual mode in which the reader contracts with the
writer for a specified amount of meaningful experience, to be paid for in
cash and ingested at the reader's convenience, satisfaction guaranteed.
The preferred predecessor abases himself before the image of an harried
reader tight on time and money.  The writer should do nothing unduly
troublesome to such a reader.  The editor, his book, and the writers whose
work is collected in that book, all want to do troubling things to such
readers.

8.  The reviewer feels just as though he has been appointed to adjudicate
the contract dispute between the book and its possible readers (it is a
class-action suit).  Noted on the readers' behalf are numerous injurious
failures to deliver: there are no theses or critiques, no musical pleasures
(due in part to the existence of a bad foreign predecessor who encouraged
writers to abjure music), nor even fragments of music.

Because no rational alternative to the contract that binds seller to buyer
can be imagined by the reviewer, and because certain of the writers in the
book under review do not write in a manner conformable to the contract
theory of language, a "religious covenant" must be in place.  Here the
reviewer relies on the old saw, when you try to be secular, it is because
you are a Marxist; when you try to be Marxist, it's clearly because you are
a cult-member.

9.  In a book nearly five hundred pages long there are likely to be
techniques, and even whole pieces, that someone out of sympathy with the
project in general can like.  The reviewer writes one sentence about each
of the seven writers who appear to him as having, however inexplicably,
broken free of the cultish, conspiratorial, gobbledygook-centered,
communist-plot-hatching, Cambridge set.

Exceptional writer 1 floods the reader, speckles the noise, and is grimly
amusing.

Exceptional writer 2 wrestles with and somehow overcomes her platitudinous
subject matter.


10.  Exceptional writer 3 isn't part of the group anyway, as shown by the
beauty and self-confidence of his poem imitative of a foreign predecessor
of uncertain long-term value.

Exceptional writer 4 contributes an essay and an elegy; the former is
careful, the latter quietly subtle.

Exceptional writer 5 receives two sentences.  He is said to be careful in
how he confuses things and also hilarious and disturbing.

Exceptional writer 6 overcomes a tendency to obliqueness to present a
"hospital-centered narrative."

Exceptional writer 7 also receives two sentences.  He too shows signs of
obliqueness, but he is charming and innocent in addition.  Indeed, this
writer conflates musicality with mellifluity in a way that excites the
reviewer.  He is called a "Holy Fool" but the reviewer means it as a
compliment.

11.  The review of the book that won't say what kind of book it is,
collecting work by a group of writers who won't say they are a group,
edited by a person who doesn't know what he means to do, and who only
writes poetics in disguise, must end sometime (sigh).

What better way to close, thinks the reviewer, than with another allusion
to the cultural authority of my preferred predecessor.  Poetry is a wide
and varied territory, says the predecessor; we understand him to mean that
there are many contracts to sign.  Taking sides is no way to understand
poetry, says the predecessor; we understand his advice to us very well:
Quiet subsumption under a false universal is preferable to stubborn
endurance in illegitimate particularity.  These guiding words of the
preferred predecessor are especially stirring in the wake of the reviewer's
systematic violation of every norm appealed to therein.  It is refreshing
to find practice once again so far out ahead of abstraction and theory.


The writers in the book under review have decided to test the validity of
their writing against criteria other than those of the market.  The
reviewer sees this as elective auto-marginalization.  The writers in the
book under review have contested the assumption that writing which submits
to market-criteria is the only writing there is.  The reviewer sees this as
sour grapes.

The appearance of objectivity requires concessions such as: No work is all
bad.  The reviewer candidly admires some of the results yielded by "open
forms, surrealism, ellipsis."  That out of the way, the temporarily
postponed judgment arrives with undiminished zeal: No work is all bad, but
this work is as near as one gets.  What is good about the writing of sullen
elective auto-marginalizing types is not specific to them.  It is good also
in good, accessible, mainstream writing.  What is good about the good
writing in this bad book may lift some of these writers out of the
captivity of the bad group responsible for the bad book.  The bad writers
will sink back into the shadowlands of narcissism, self-congratulation, and
delusory elitism, where they will try to suppress their brief encounted
with "fresh and foreign critical interrogation."

The reviewer will appear again in the pages of the TLS.

what's the conference?  there're a coupla weekly papers, the Twin Cities Reader
and the City Pages, that have extensive listings of events, etc.  they're free
at most coffee shops, etc.  also, call the Loft (the largest writing institution
in the cities) for their events.  the loft is pretty conservative in its scope
tho.  also call bryant-lake bowl (a groovy bowling alley, cafe, and
"alternative" performance space), and the walker art center, which sometimes
hosts fun stuff.  some listers past and present from the tcs are: me, mark
nowak, jeff hansen, gary sullivan, marta deike, kurt anderson, jonathan brannen
(actually i morris mn), bob gale (another person to call about events, as he
edits SHOUT!, a free monthly for spoken word arts), some lurkers i do and don't
know about. that's about it for first thing in the morning; i'll give it a bit
more concerted thot in the next week or so.  maybe we cd have a coffee hr
somewhre and meet u.

Subject:      Creeley at 70 in Buffalo

                        CREELEY AT 70 IN BUFFALO

        DATELINE BUFFALO. The 70th birthday celebration in honor of Robert
Creeley moves along with extraordinary momentum. First night: Eileen Myles,
introduced by Creeley, read to a packed crowd in the large Halwall's
performance space, with its stage bordered on three sides by the audience.
Her figure animated against the somewhat large stage, reading and letting
each page of text drift to the floor after reading it. Voice, presence,
narrative rang solidly to a thoroughly enthusiastic crowd. Second day: the
formal opening of  activities by William Greiner, UB president and Creeley
colleague who first met Creeley long-distance while Creeley was in Finland.
Then, Gil Sorrentino, fondly introduced by Joseph Conte, reading in the
Katherine Cornell Theatre, a good-sized semi-formal spaceship architecture
palace space on the edge of Buffalo's tundra-tinged north campus. Sorrentino
read prose from a new piece (I think forthcoming in _Conjunctions_). A
richly written piece, supercharged with irony, purposely laden with the
banalities of the wife-swapping personalities it characterized and the
revolting misogyny and sexual beasty balls of its less-than-likable
narrator. Above this content, the precision of Sorrentino's prose glimmered
like a city skyline. Amiri Baraka, originally scheduled to read with
Sorrentino, was unable to appear. Creeley therefore gave a preview
mini-reading, talking briefly and reading the full text of his _Dogs of
Auckland_ (approximate title) chapbook forthcoming from Meow Press. A
gorgeous piece of work. This reading was followed by a reception in the
poetry collection and its great assembly of rare, beautiful, and ephemeral
Creeley materials and also a retrospective (mostly small press) of poetry
chez Buffalo for the past 50 years. A delirious spread of rare and
richly-diverse print artifacts that gave a varied sense of the "scene" as
passing in and out and back into the "city of no illusions". Back at
Katherine Cornell, next up was the Creeley-Dine event, the room full to the
rafters. (So packed the fire marshall was threatening to turn back
poetry-goers if they could not prove they had a seat.) Creeley introduced at
length and eloquently by Susan Howe. Then an extraordinary reading by
Creeley. First an explanation of the 1-2-3 method then a 1-2-3 section from
_Mabel: A Story_ a prose work dating an early Creeley-Dine collaboration.
This was a long piece, at times dropping into choppy Burroughsesque rhythms,
other times richly wry and funny, and other times simply sailing along
tellingly. A rare treat to witness the performance of this important earlier
prose piece. This reading was followed by "Histoire de Florida" a later,
powerful, long, languid, pulling out like the tide and the backdrop of
all-that-has-happened, rhythmic, emotional, and meditative masterwork. Then
Dine was introduced excellently by Charles Bernstein followed by the
Creeley-Dine conversation. Truly extraordinary, to hear these two men talk
about a range of subjects near and dear to both art and writing, "tools" of
any trade, age and its perspectives, perseverance and its perspectives, the
necessities of incessant travel and, well, all in all, what it means to hang
in there. This was a primo opportunity to hear both the writer and the
artist talk. Creeley and Dine were terrific. It was a particularly wonderful
opportunity to hear from Dine, an artist who gets to Buffalo all too rarely,
and to hear him speak so openly, honestly, his talk as rich as writing
itself, there in the open space where things are stilled for some hours we
can all hold for the true celebration of artistic life they are. Hey, this
*is* what it means to hang in there.
        STILL TO COME: Ashbery reading this afternoon then tonight Hallwalls Jazz
concert with Steve Kuhn and Carol Fredette.
        ONLINE: check out http://writing.upenn.edu/epc/authors/creeley/70th where
you can also see the Dine painting for this event and other stuff.

Maria, thanks for asking about my play, "Wet Paint," which indeed did get
finished, still wet, and presented on Wednesday.  All the actors=8Ba motley
crew of the Bay Area's best painters, filmmakers, poets, videographers,
drag performers, art writers, and novelists=8Bshowed up, which was such a
help, and so difficult corralling 19 divas all in one room at one time.
And some of them are the kind who, presented with a script, will whip out
rulers to determine how many inches they have (of dialogue, of course).
But they were all there and all fantastic.

I could try to reconstruct the audience a la Jordan Davis, but I was too
nervous really to note more than a few of the hundreds of people who were
there.  I remember however Fanny Howe coming up to me after the show was
over and saying that it reminded her of growing up in Cambridge when her
mother, Mary Manning Howe, was in charge of the Poets Theater there
(mid-fifties?), and nothing could have pleased me more.

Also spotted: the writers Rebecca Solnit, Tina Rotenberg, Jocelyn
Saidenberg, Matthew Stadler, Renee Gladman, Michael Price, Avery Burns,
Leslie Davis, Pamela Lu, Barbara Guest, Susan Gevirtz, Laura Moriarty,
Brian Strang, Aaron Shurin, Charlie Smith, Rena Rosenwasser, Duncan
McNaughton, Bill Berkson, Larry Kearney, Jay Schwartz, Lauren Gudath,
George Albon (replete with new, utterly delicious new boyfriend), and the
artists Brett Reichman, Fran Herndon, Chris Komater, Peter Mitchell-Dayton,
Vincent Fecteau, Jennifer Locke, Nao Bustamente....

And many more both on this list and not.  Tosh Berman, you will be glad I
know to hear that each of *your* appearances was greated with a tremendous
round of applause.  You were played by a Cabbage Patch doll that Dodie
bought at our local Thrift Town--actually, a Cabbage Patch knockoff, and
carted around in a simply, 1959 style brown paper bag.  At one point in the
action of the play, you wander away and get sucked into the vast 2000 pound
"Rose" painting of Jay DeFeo, but happily rescued by your good father.
More later.  Thanks=8BKevin K.

My thanks too to Steve Evans.

Along with the practice of "summing up" complicated bodies of work with a
sentence or 4-line quotation, the TLS reviewer (who is Robert Potts?)
manages also to bracket the construction of tradition in the Sinclair
anthology.  A few of the demonized poets showcase their forebears: David
Jones, J.F.Hendry, W.S.Graham, Nicholas Moore...So I guess what is being
bracketted here is British modernism.  As ever, "traditionalists" like the
TLS reviewer prove to have the most advanced amnesia.

It's Kevin Killian--again.  As far as Ronald Johnson goes, Dodie tells me
that he's reading at New College in November (if she remembers correctly)
so bring your copies of ARK for him to sign.  Has anybody seen the new
"Ronald Johnson" by Dirk Stratton--it's one of those little books from
Boise State University (Western Writers Series #122).  The drawing of RJ on
the cover makes him look just like poetics list member Ed Foster; however
there's no picture of author "Dirk Stratton."  Does anyone know him, or do
I just remember that name from "Bonanza"?  (Or, possibly, some old Fred
Halsted film from the seventies?)

Stratton says (page 52), "Maybe Johnson is a writer of the American West,
but we are simply unable to recognize exactly why."  So it's interesting.
E-mail for Western Writers Series is at wws@quartz.idbsu.edu.

Thanks everybody.

Subject:      Steve Carll reading

Hi, it's Kevin Killian.  Thanks, Steve, for announcing your reading over
the internet.  I'm back and I'm glad I went.  As usual the reading started
over 2 hours late, but "on time" for other readings that I've attended
there at 530 Page Street.  Everyone was in a party mood and that's exactly
what they got.  First Edmund Berrigan read--a selection of poems from all
different manuscripts, leading up to the new work, a series of prose poems
in which he has finally escaped from the autobiographical this and that
allusion trap of his previous oeuvre.  Well done, Edmund.  Then I saw some
big strong men moving around an elaborate stereo system and realized we
were in for a multi-media presentation by Steve Carll.  He put on a record
and announced that since he wrote to music, it seemed possible to try to
reproduce those conditions while reading.  I think the record was by Alice
Coltrane and Pharaoh Sanders.  Over this melange of sound Steve read
excerpts from his two new books, "Sincerity Loops" and "trace a moment's
closure for clues," for about twenty five minutes, then the music stopped
and he read some short funny essays on "Drugs"  Caffeine, television,
ecstasy, morphine, crack and alcohol are some I remember.  Everyone was in
stitches or if not stitches in knits and purls.  Long live the salon, where
there's an intimacy that sometimes more suited towards sharing new work
than in the big spaces in town here.  Now how can I get funding for having
people over at my apartment?  Does funding = theater?

Thanks, Steve Evans. I've taken the liberty of snail-mailing a copy of your

                        CREELEY AT 70 IN BUFFALO

        DAY 3. Back in the Katherine Cornell theatre, Susan Schultz could have had
no more style, zest, and presence than in her introduction of John Ashbery
in which she first met a man who called himself Ashbery (Bernstein) and in
which she recounted her pilgrimage to the Ashbery family apple farm not far
from the site of the present event. Ashbery=92s reading was first-rate.
Ashbery, a poet who will soon be the same age as the man who this gathering
celebrated, performed fully in command of his craft, reading from his latest
book as well as from new poems. Ashbery=92s reading was followed by a
reception across the hall where poetrygoers were able to congregate and
compare notes at the penultimate chime of this poetry celebration=92s
verse-bent clock.
        What could top things so far? The finale of course! The night of day three,
Hallwall=92s Jazz concert with Steve Kuhn and Carol Fredette. Perhaps the=
 most
decked out I=92ve seen Hallwall=92s with not only great book tables (thanks=
 to
Talking Leaves) but also, inside, two food tables, one with the cheeses,
meats, breads, and grapes, and the other buckling under the weight of the
two enormous cakes (one chocolate, one yellow) specially lettered for such a
day. Inside, Kuhn and Fredette got going. Standards sprinkled among
renditions of takes from the Steve Swallow release _Home_ (ECM Records 1160)
on which Sheila Jordan did the vocals. The piano=92s tones, registers,=
 chordal
thunderwalls in boots soled with celestial dust =97 while Fredette=92s scats
were nourished by dizzying drops into the deep, mellow, honey-coated lower
register of her extraordinary voice. Many numbers to stun the crowd ("She
Was Young" and "Ice Cream" among the memorable takes) and many numbers
lifted like toasts to the music ship=92s first mate seated with a grin and
pensive attentiveness front row center. One of the outstanding moments was
Kuhn=92s solo improvisation dedicated to Creeley. No piano has ever been
explored, imploded, stretched into silver multi-vocaled strands, rode into a
thundered, multi-leveled, multi-chromatic union with the absolute
possibilities of sound.
        As the program was originally envisioned, Mercury Rev would=92ve been next=
 on
stage. They had canceled so, really, it would=92ve been over now. But seated
behind me in the second row, humming audibly to some of the standards was
the man who would do the finale for this 70th, Amiri Baraka, introduced with
incredible acumen by Bill Fischer.
        Baraka could=92ve no less stormed the stage than if he had been=
 backed
by the John Coltrane quartet itself. Baraka=92s small build gives one no
preparation for the immense vision, rhythm, voicing, and cadences that will
emerge from the flaming words of his performance. Invoking as central to the
_Yugen_ of Baraka=92s earlier years, "the big three" of the magazine,=
 Ginsberg
(is that right?), big Charlie Olson, and Bob Creeley. (Sorrentino, by the
way, also appeared in _Yugen_.) Baraka paid homage to Creeley then performed
from _Transbluecency_ and his more recent _Funk Lore_ (Los Angeles: Littoral
Books, 1996). Baraka=92s humming, chanting, and vocal renditions of the
standards-a la-Baraka were in perfect accord with the chords still
lingering, clinging to the packed, overflowing theatre. No printed text can
do this! People filling all seats, people on all sides, standing, squatting,
spilling out into the Hallwall=92s hallway. Blues, transblues,=
 transvoicings,
the unbelievable coup d=92=E9tats of Baraka=92s "lowcoups" (African American
version of that knock-out blast commonly associated with the haiku), and his
closing triumph (slaves, dig, we were once slaves). Indeed, it was about
people, what we are, the rhythms that vibrate through one and the same.
Amiri brought it home. And home we were =97 at least so is Buffalo in many
senses. Oh, for a home like this. Happy birthday celebration, Robert=
 Creeley!

Joe -

I'm sorry it's taken a couple of days to get back to this.  'cause no one
else picked up on this thread, I probably should have just back channelled
this.  But I took the morally indefensible position of sending it to the
entire list instead.

I understand the desire for a more clearly sited ethos in the work.  I'm
just not sure I see it growing out of some official selection of this
week's poem of the year, or defining a bad innovative poetry, the
discussions which you jumped off from.

Despite the mottled (at best) political history of experimental verse in
this century, it is difficult to imagine any innovative writing now that
comes from a conservative mindset.  Although I don't see Language poetry as
the only viable contemporary innovation, I may have been blinded to other
possibilities by the blitz of adamant progressive left positions taken in
many (especially early) critical and poetic works from the Language end of
things.

Perhaps I just don't know about the redlining bank loan officers, killers,
and right-wing militia members who are currently writing innovative
non-mainstream verse.  Looking at moral issues much finer than these gets
into a morass that often just seems like gossip to me.  Let those writers
who are without sin ...

I can think of a couple of things that do go in a direction that may be
useful to you.  In Bob Perelman's two recent books of essays, especially,
but not only, the sections about Pound and Andrews, touch on the
responsibility of the writer, and the reader, to address moral and
political issues.

And I recently read a short piece somewhere (& I'll probably be embarassed,
if not ethically compromised, when I finally remember where) that made a
case for the anthology "Poems for the Millenium" as a stronger collection
of ethical/politically engaged work than some of the current collections of
"poetry of witness."

Subject:      San Francisco library scandals

As some on this list already know, the San Francisco library--especially
its new high-tech main library--has been having a rough time of it.

The New Main Library buiding is a kind of suburban postmodern joke--
plenty of light wells and no room for books or reading. The City
Librarian is in love with obsolete computers and his corporate pals
who are intent on privatizing library services on a fee-per-use
basis. The system is short-staffed--it takes a book between one and
three months to make it back to the shelf after it's been returned
to the library. The City Librarian is responsible for dumping
many thousands of books without following proper weeding procedures.
And on and on. All this in the effort to make the San Francisco
public library a "21st-century library."

Though some of the scandals are indeed local and have to do with
particular corrupt and incompetent people, the example of what's
happened to the San Francisco Public Library has bearing on the
transformation of libraries around the world. To my mind, it's an
object lesson of what can go wrong when a mania for technology
combines with the limited morality of corporate sharks
to turn a public space into an "information node" and "profit
center." The result is an antilibrary: enemy of books and readers.

Details are available in Nicholson Baker's fine article in this
week's New Yorker, "The Author vs. the Library." The current Ampersand
has articles by historian Gray Brechin, poet and librarian Steve
LaVoie, and bookbinder Dominic Riley. I have a letter in the current
San Francisco Weekly. And I've attached a summary of a recent CNN
spot on the subject.

CNN Abstract of SFPL Piece as posted on WWW (Web has pics)

Title: San Francisco library accused of pitching thousands of books
Date of Post: October 13, 1996 Web posted at: 8:15 a.m. Broadcast: Story
aired October 12, 1996 at 2:20 p.m.(PST) (Also on FOX TV) WEB address:

San Francisco Library Accused of Pitching Thousands of Books

SAN FRANCISCO (CNN) -- A group of book lovers in San Francisco is fuming
over the opening of a new library, claiming that thousands of books were
dumped to accommodate the spanking clean building. "I think the library,
in essence, has become a showcase for high technology at great expense
to book collections and print collections," historian Walter Biller
said.

Biller has a computer list which he claims identifies thousands of
books, many irreplaceable, that were discarded when the San Francisco
Public Library moved into its new location, heralded as the coming of a
new age for libraries. "I believe 19,000 of them were last copies," he
said.

A recent New Yorker article called it "The Great Book Purge" and said
more than 100,000 books were hauled to the dump. Librarian Marcia
Schneider admits an error occurred "for a brief period of time," and
library officials say they don't know for sure how many books were
tossed out, but estimate it to be around 20,000. But Schneider points
out that some 430,000 new books were added to the library's collection
when it moved.

"It has 9.1 miles of more shelf space than the old library. It has
proportionately more shelf space than the old library," Schneider said,
adding that it's a debate about the future of libraries.

"In many ways, it's a debate about technology versus the old-fashioned
version of the library." Critics say computers belong in the library but
so do the print treasures of the past. "Where are the books?" Biller
asks. "There are atriums. There are spaces in the floor that go up five
stories and there is nowhere for books?"

Interesting Baraka notes. I have been lucky enough to hear him in each
decade in different places, and I appreciate what you say about amazing
power he knows to speak. I remember once in the late, I think 80s, he is at
the Sunsplash in Victoria, and there are a bunch of youngsters (this is
outdoors of course) who have come to hear Taj Mahal, but then this other
Black man, a little guy in glasses, makes his first noise in the mike, and
those youngsters, been sprawled about, they SIT UP fast, and lissen!

But also remember in the Olson days, Amiri saying he was never going back
to Buffalo, and I imagine he uttered a number of nevers in his day.

Thanks again for the desc.

Am real happy to announce the publication of my new book, Molecular Jam,
from Jazz Police Books (wordcraft@oregontrail.net.)
the book is available from SPD, Permeable Press & Chris Drumm Books.
on the back cover, Ivan Arguelles says
"Like the best of his contemporaries, Jake Berry or Will Alexander, Raphael
takes his language into the swiftly developing chasms of new sci-tech
terminology, while still maintaining his balance of humor. Clearly, in
reading his text, we are part the end of the 20th century"
I'll be reading from the book 11/13 at Powells Books on SE Hawthorne here in
Portland OR.

>                        CREELEY AT 70 IN BUFFALO
>
>        DATELINE BUFFALO. The 70th birthday celebration in honor of Robert
>Creeley moves along with extraordinary momentum. First night: Eileen Myles,
>introduced by Creeley, read to a packed crowd in the large Halwall's
>performance space, with its stage bordered on three sides by the audience.
>Her figure animated against the somewhat large stage, reading and letting
>each page of text drift to the floor after reading it. Voice, presence,
>narrative rang solidly to a thoroughly enthusiastic crowd. Second day: the
>formal opening of  activities by William Greiner, UB president and Creeley
>colleague who first met Creeley long-distance while Creeley was in Finland.
>Then, Gil Sorrentino, fondly introduced by Joseph Conte, reading in the
>Katherine Cornell Theatre, a good-sized semi-formal spaceship architecture
>palace space on the edge of Buffalo's tundra-tinged north campus. Sorrentino
>read prose from a new piece (I think forthcoming in _Conjunctions_). A
>richly written piece, supercharged with irony, purposely laden with the
>banalities of the wife-swapping personalities it characterized and the
>revolting misogyny and sexual beasty balls of its less-than-likable
>narrator. Above this content, the precision of Sorrentino's prose glimmered
>like a city skyline. Amiri Baraka, originally scheduled to read with
>Sorrentino, was unable to appear. Creeley therefore gave a preview
>mini-reading, talking briefly and reading the full text of his _Dogs of
>Auckland_ (approximate title) chapbook forthcoming from Meow Press. A
>gorgeous piece of work. This reading was followed by a reception in the
>poetry collection and its great assembly of rare, beautiful, and ephemeral
>Creeley materials and also a retrospective (mostly small press) of poetry
>chez Buffalo for the past 50 years. A delirious spread of rare and
>richly-diverse print artifacts that gave a varied sense of the "scene" as
>passing in and out and back into the "city of no illusions". Back at
>Katherine Cornell, next up was the Creeley-Dine event, the room full to the
>rafters. (So packed the fire marshall was threatening to turn back
>poetry-goers if they could not prove they had a seat.) Creeley introduced at
>length and eloquently by Susan Howe. Then an extraordinary reading by
>Creeley. First an explanation of the 1-2-3 method then a 1-2-3 section from
>_Mabel: A Story_ a prose work dating an early Creeley-Dine collaboration.
>This was a long piece, at times dropping into choppy Burroughsesque rhythms,
>other times richly wry and funny, and other times simply sailing along
>tellingly. A rare treat to witness the performance of this important earlier
>prose piece. This reading was followed by "Histoire de Florida" a later,
>powerful, long, languid, pulling out like the tide and the backdrop of
>all-that-has-happened, rhythmic, emotional, and meditative masterwork. Then
>Dine was introduced excellently by Charles Bernstein followed by the
>Creeley-Dine conversation. Truly extraordinary, to hear these two men talk
>about a range of subjects near and dear to both art and writing, "tools" of
>any trade, age and its perspectives, perseverance and its perspectives, the
>necessities of incessant travel and, well, all in all, what it means to hang
>in there. This was a primo opportunity to hear both the writer and the
>artist talk. Creeley and Dine were terrific. It was a particularly wonderful
>opportunity to hear from Dine, an artist who gets to Buffalo all too rarely,
>and to hear him speak so openly, honestly, his talk as rich as writing
>itself, there in the open space where things are stilled for some hours we

anybody catch frank lentricchia's remarkable renunciation of lit. theory &
criticism ("last will & testament of an ex-literary critic") in the
september/october _lingua franca_?... in his about-face, lentricchia pretty
much pooh-poohs any writing or insights or theories 'about' literature,
having presumably (if this isn't simply a sokal-style prank, i mean, and i
don't think it is) found the pleasure of the text per se in reading books
aloud (as a platonic 'rhapsode,' no shit) in his undergrad. (as opposed to
his grad.) classrooms... evidently, he's now taken to writing fiction
himself...

of course this'll likely be served up by conservatives as a primo example
of an ideologically-based critic who now confesses to having been led
astray...

really love to hear what anybody & everybody else thinks...

The Thirty Pound Sacks

After a heavy rain the river crested. Parcels of low-lying fields
slipped along the banks, opening the earth to free shallow-graved
corpses and send them into the brown water with enough dead breath
to find buoyancy inches beneath the surface. We saw the dark
masses passing as if evicted from heaven and attempted
to spill their hopelessness into the ocean. Children pitched stones
and shouted the name of an unpopular child's grandmother.
Later fisherman dragged grappling hooks across the bottom, retrieved
corpses and limbs, wrapped them in thirty pound sacks and sold
them to men sent by their wives to wait on the docks. Other men
brought home sacks of sticks and fish heads soaked in salt water.

yup, i sure did.  read it and was nauseated by it.  reminded me of certain
folks i know who went through mid-life religious conversions.  i, too,
thought at first that i might be reading farce, but no such luck.  what's
weird about lentricchia's stance, however, is that i don't know a single
literary critic who *doesn't* read for the sheer pleasure of it.  we might
all talk theory, but most of us got into theory because we love the Word,
and we'd surely like our students to share that love.  (that's why we assign
them books we liked ourselves, isn't it?) so his argument is basically,
well... straw. i mean, who's his opposition?  lit critters who don't like
literature?  find me one.

>of course this'll likely be served up by conservatives as a primo example
>of an ideologically-based critic who now confesses to having been led
>astray...

it seemed clear enough to me that the article was *written* for this
purpose.  (rather than because lentricchia suddenly felt compelled to
confess his change of heart.)  has he joined the national association of
scholars?  does he want to Take Back the MLA from the hordes of
queer-commie-theorists? what's *he* got to be bitter about?  interesting
that it was in the same issue as a pretty favorable article on far-right
colleges.  what might be _lingua franca's_ agenda?  (un unreliable rag, at
best.)

middle-aged tenured white men turning to the Right and embracing all that is
Good and Traditional don't surprise me at all.  for them, it's a comfortable
place to sit; maybe more comfortable than hanging out with the
queer-commie-theorists who are bound to ask embarrassing questions and make
unflattering comparisons.  me, i'm impressed with the middle-aged tenured
white guys (and i know quite a few) who *refuse* to mainstream even though
they'd personally benefit by it.

re The Conductors of Chaos Anthology: Salt 10 (May 1997 - Salt 9, November
1996 is due out shortly) will carry not only a comprehensive review of this
book, but new poems from a number of the poets featured. Salt 9 includes an
"oddity" that may be of appeal to those interested in the work of J.H.
Prynne - a French translation of "Day Light Songs" ("Chansons =E0 la
Journee-Lumi=E8re") by the late Bernard Dubourg. Folio (Salt), the
co-publishers of Salt, are publishing Prynne's "Collected Poems" in 1997.
Salt 9 also includes three new Ashbery poems.

I think Steve Evans should be strongly encouraged to send his recent piece
to the New York Times Literary Supplement. Whether they will publish it or
not, I'd be interested in hearing how they respond. What do you think,
Steve?

In-Reply-To:  Message of Sun, 13 Oct 1996 17:54:59 -0400 from
              <bernstei@ACSU.BUFFALO.EDU>

Curious that the _TLS_ even bothered to assign a review for _Conductors of
Chaos_.  Messerli, Hoover, Weinberger, etc.--were they reviewed in the _NY
Times Book Review_ or _The New York Review of Books_?

Curious too that the book that props up Robert Potts' critique of the anthology
(Donald Davie's _Purity of Diction in English Verse_) was published in 1952.
Having read him now,I'd say that Potts is not altogether obtuse but merely
unsympathetic and predictable:  yet another voice of the Movement.  Nodding in
the direction of one or two poets who challenge that frame (Douglas Oliver,
Barry MacSweeney, etc.) sustains it by making it appear flexible.  As a study
in the tactics of a "mainstream," it might be contrasted with the silence of
literary journalists in the US.

Potts is so intent on blasting Prynne and "Cambridge" that he obliterates
real differences among the poets in the anthology, so that we hear nothing,
for instance, of the fact that the anthology includes a poet born in 1918
(Nicholas Moore) and another born in 1964 (Drew Milne).  Part of the work of
the anthology involves uncovering some of that which the Movement helped bury,
but this cannot be mentioned apparently so that the Movement remains timeless
and "English."

More to say but not today--except that the anthology, as CB suggests, is well
worth checking out.

Keith: the NYTBR has an odd "policy" according to which it does not
review "anthologies." There is of course no explanation why this policy
was set up when god or the editor of the NYTBR hovered over chaos &
decided reviewing the world. -- Pierre

Bravo, Keith Tuma.  When Messerli, Hoover, and Weinberger appeared, there
were no major mainstream American reviews though the TLS did give the
Hoover anthology (and perhaps the others in different issues?) a short but
sympathetic review.  As for the NYT, they were reviewing Amy Hempel's
salute to dogs  (or was it poems by dogs) anthology around that time. Life
is strangely and predictably unfair, no?

Bravo qalso to the Creeley thread, esp. Ron Silliman's recent posting and
to all the Nobel bashers!

Lisa Robertson

at the New College Theater
777 Valencia Street, SF
$5

Erin Mour=E9 is one of Canada=B9s greatest poets. Her restless poetic presen=
ce
on the Canadian scene has been praised, questioned, rewarded, scorned,
embraced, doubted since the late 70s. Originally from Calgary , she now
lives in Montreal and, having been recently "downsized", now works as a
freelance editor and translator. In her writing, "the body, women's bodies
in particular, and language intersect to dislocate expectation and reinvent
the world." She has published seven books of poetry including _Furious_
(which won the Governor General's Award=8Bthe Pulitzer Prize of Canada,
except more so). Her poetry has been collected in _The Green Word: Selected
Poems 1973-1992_ (Oxford University Press). Her most recent books are
_Sheepish Beauty, Civilian Love_ (Vehicule, Montreal, 1992) and _Search
Procedures_ (Anansi, Toronto, 1996).

Lisa Robertson is a member of the Kootenay School of Writing, a group of
energetic young poets who collectively changed the face of Western Canadian
writing beginning in the 1980s. She co-edits the poetry journal _Raddle
Moon_ with Susan Clark in Vancouver. Her new manuscript, _Debbie: an epic_,
on which she has been working for many years, promises to be a Molotov
cocktail of Edith Sitwell=B9s _War Trilogy_ and Stanley Donen=B9s _Funny Fac=
e_.
=B3Think pink!=B2 In her spare time, she tells her American fans, Lisa visit=
s
scrap yards and trains large dogs. Her books and chapbooks include _The
Apothecary_ and _XEclogue_ (Tsunami Editions), _Barscheit Horse_ (with
Catriona Strang and Christine Stewart) (The Berkeley Horse), and the brand
new _The Descent: a light comedy in three parts_ (Meow Press).

Subject:      student sincerity

This is Dodie--

Still teaching--or as Lacan put it, playing "subject supposed to know."
(Forgive me if I've screwed up the reference.)  Anyway, I'm still stumped
when somebody brings in something that is totally wrong-headed, how to
steer them gently into a more useful direction.  The following poem was
posted to the beat generation listserv, and it seemed to me to be a perfect
example of bad student poetry.  When I look at it my mind goes blank--as
far as anything useful to say.  One simply couldn't grunt out, "Don't do
this anymore."  If this were handed in to any of you--what would you say
about it--as a way to begin a dialogue?

Thanks.

That's a song lyric, not a poem.
It's by the 10,000 Maniacs.
The music's no good either.

Bad student poetry it may be (personally I never liked this song), but she -
Natalie Merchant - and they - 10,000 Maniacs - have made a fortune from it.

This is Dodie--

Still teaching--or as Lacan put it, playing "subject supposed to know."
(Forgive me if I've screwed up the reference.)  Anyway, I'm still stumped
when somebody brings in something that is totally wrong-headed, how to
steer them gently into a more useful direction.  The following poem was
posted to the beat generation listserv, and it seemed to me to be a perfect
example of bad student poetry.  When I look at it my mind goes blank--as
far as anything useful to say.  One simply couldn't grunt out, "Don't do
this anymore."  If this were handed in to any of you--what would you say
about it--as a way to begin a dialogue?

Thanks.

actually dodie there're many ways to approach this.  as one who teaches how
tto  read more than how to write my remarks may be off the mark for your
purposes, but here goes.  the obvious one is to play the song to them and
ask how the effect is similar or different when the experience is not one
of reading but an aural one. it is as fatuous a song as it is a text?
then, the issue of fatuousness itself.  one of the charms of the song, it
seems, is that it to some extent engages kerouac's charms and
embarrassments --his fatuousness, in fact.  one could juxtapose a passage
of kerouac with this song lyric and compare/contrast.  the song's
clumsinesses can be looked at not as errors but as part of the genre in
which the lyricist is working.  K's work is both oddly compelling but also
mortifyingly self-indulgent, sweet but often misguided and evocative of
what mary pratt calls "strategies of innocence" (cf. "little boy lost
etc")as the subject-in-power naturalizes his descriptions of his chosen
exotic locale through seeming objectivity that is, nonetheless, nuanced
with affirmations (the naturalist, for example, describes the flora and
fauna of the "unspoiled" i.e. not-yet-Europeanized territory in ways that
obviously value its unspoiledness, disavowing his/her complicity with more
openly predatory invaders).  so, jack both celebrates primitivism and
aspires to transcend it; his sympathetic renderings nonetheless place him
in a clearly superior position to those he describes. (you speak with the
voice of the little people, o saint jack, so you Represent and subsume
them).  you can use the song to analyze the kerouac cult, to discuss
women's interesting investment in kerouac. this song and songwriter are no
favorites of mine, but if a student brought it in to class with an
obviously worshipful intent, these are some of the tactics i might use.
let me know what happens. xo, md

America uber alles, nicht wahr?  Sorry if I sounded snide, Dodie. I found
Maria's remarks very insightful, esp. the idea of juxtaposing Kerouac's text
with the song's. But if it happened in my class, and I must add that I don't
teach yet, but will soon, I think I wld. lead the discussion into an
exploration of fetishes and sentimentality, albeit gently. JK and the Beats
are invoked in this song for their nostalgic value. It all smacks of scars
that never felt the wound. That wld be the place to begin: get the writer to
explain/justify his/her intentions and attendant emotional associations.
Albeit gently. In a way this song is rather sophisticated as a document of
inauthentic public longing, more for what it deliberately leaves out then
what it includes. It succeeds in reducing the Beats to icons in a teenager's
bedroom on a par with stuffed animals and Metallica posters.

i like this too --jk is so nostalgic himself for small town america and
innocence ("sad" and "strange" are his favorite words it seems) --it seems like
a great way to lead into a discussion of longing --there's also something about
the familiarity with which the song treats beat icons, "hey billy" etc that
speaks of the wannabe-ness of both Beats and postbeat yearners...see susan
stewart's wonderful book On Longing, which by the way is also a great text to
teach along w/ elizabeth bishop and travel literature in general, or have i
already said this here before? xo,md

stuffed animals and Metallica posters are pretty strong icons; also, are
you assuming with "scars that never felt the wound" that there aren't
similar pressures today? My daughter has identified with Jane's Addiction,
Courtney Love, Nirvana, Black Crows, etc. (as have I for that matter);
these are _current_ issues, not necessarily nostalgia, although they're

What you say is certainly true, Alan, but I don't see any "current" problems
finding overt expression in this particular song, the dominant tone of which
is wistful, not angst-ridden. The appropriation of the Beats as
icons/fetishes does, however,  express some degree of anxiety about a
generation's longing for direction.  (And yes, I suppose a stuffed animal is
as powerful an icon as a crucifix).

Dear Friend:

It is time again to support women who need your help to survive with
dignity and pride.  Your thoughtful contributions are essential for Manavi
to continue our work of assisting women who are experiencing violence in
their lives.  We request that you keep Manavi in mind again when you make

We cannot even hope to accomplish our work without your support.  Your
contributions to Manavi will help us provide counseling, small loans, legal
support and other assistance to women of South Asian descent in need.  We
ask you to specify Manavi (P.O. Box 614, Bloomfield, NJ 07003; Phone (908)

True--there is something thrilling and beautiful even in identifying fully
with a cultural icon--it kind of fibrillates aspects of one's subconscious.
But there are honest ways of expressing this and there are ways that come
across, as Pat puts it, inauthentic.  I think that the difficulty with the
"Hey Jack Kerouac" is that, besides its minefield of cliches, it involves
an unexamined ownership of experience that doesn't belong to the writer--in
a way that doesn't take it in any new directions.  On the beatlist,
constantly Kerouac is referred to as "Jack."  As if merely reading "On the
Road" made you one of the heightened brotherhood, in someway made you Jack.
This is sounding  a lot like communion.

While I tend to agree with you (and I don't like Hey Jack Kerouac as a
poem), I'm loathe to define "honest" and "authentic/inauthentic" etc. -
especially given an incredibly fragmented culture. And music _means_ to a
lot of people way beyond the lyrics - look at Robert Walser's analysis of
heavy metal. Personally, I prefer 10000m to Madonna, etc. But the point is
that expressivity in music culture goes way beyond the ostensible lyric
content of the songs, and I'm not sure that "authenticity" has had any
real coin since Heidegger and/or Sartre...

For me, a problem on this list, repeatedly, is that of _audience._ Who are
we critiquing and in what context? Similar issues came up with the Nobel
Prize poem. I don't think we're careful enough in listening, and
especially in listening to alterity.

Thanks for bringing some philosophy into this, you know, making it a

Well, rather than bringing philosophy into it, let's continue in our usual
fashion of disparaging popular poets and poems, pop music, and anything
else that doesn't meet our unstated standards. Because after all, we know
better. We're experimental.

I agree - no philosophy - just pure opinion. I LOVE IT

Illegal Park

                                                                for Chris &
Juliana



The description of this is an event at Writer's House that took
place October 7-8 1996 on the campus of the University of
Pennsylvania at Philadelphia.  Shawn had announced the
safeness of an academic lot behind Writer's House but also
cautioned that minnesota plates had proven to be dangerous.
I wondered how plates from california would fare.
You're right to think they didn't fare well.  My car got towed,
the remnants of a hurricane were around, Willmington
is whence we came and these are the nodes.




After Marlene is fed toast on 5th street, Juliana & I
get in the car to drive to Philadelphia.  Juliana points
between the seats and asks if I keep my bird there.
No, I keep it over here I say and reach and pull the crow
feathers out of the vent.  Chris is taking the train.




We go thru the Holland Tunnel and hit the turnpike.
We talk about references.  I'm embarrassed not
to have any good ones.  We pass Cherry Hill
which has a big bed bath & beyond.  Juliana
thinks we should have been getting off the njTp
but I say there are To 95 signs around.  When it's
10 miles to the Delaware bridge I ask Juliana if
she feels like we've gone too far.  Yes.  At the end
of the njTp I ask the toll taker what the best way
to phili is.  He stands six five, wears cop ray bans
and looks like uncle fester.  30 miles back was
the best way he says.  We go over the bridge to
Willmington and pick up the 95 north.  Juliana
enjoys the factory on the right because it reminds
her of the owner who murdered his wrestler boyfriend.
Dupont is ISO 9002 certified.




We get closer to phili and I apologize for missing
the turn and say she will have to tell Douglass
of my round about route.  He will get mad.
When fire is coming out the tops of poles
a guy is walking on the expressway.
He looks like a lion.  Hey!  It's Chris!




It was another guy and not really Chris
because if this guy had continued walking
on the expressway he would have made it
to Writer's House before Chris.  Chris was
supposed to read with Juliana and I was
supposed to watch.  Now it's 10 minutes
after the reading is supposed to start and
I'm on my way to the room with Josh
to get something to read.  Josh asks me
questions on the walk back to Writer's House.
I take a look at the crowd and go out on the porch
to smoke hoping this will make the bus come.
It doesn't.




Josh gets up to start by introducing.
I sit on the floor in the back.  Bill bla bla
bla Silliman bla bla bla San Diego bla bla
bla Oakland bla bla bla Ben bla bla bla Brooklyn.
Juliana bla bla bla 8 bla bla bla Chain bla bla bla
Bard bla bla bla Buffalo bla bla bla Albany.
Chris walks in with head perspiration, sits down
on the floor next to me and everyone turns around
and looks.  Josh slides into a description of Chris.
Phili bla bla bla Temple bla bla bla Oops bla bla bla
Albany bla bla bla Jersey City.




I'm in my reading with a football poem
I wrote in a sports bar with my friend Jeff.
Half way thru the piece I say this is a visual poem
so why am I reading it.  Then I talk about Joe Elliot
and walk back to where Chris is sitting, flip open my bag,
and pull out Joe's illustrated Half Gross.  Then I perform
the trick that Dug taught me.  I hand one end of Half Gross
to Chris and walk back to the reading place while the book
folds out into a long long sheet.  We hold it up.
Bob wants me to read some.  Earlier me & Juliana
had liked some of the same lines and I look for
the poems with these and read them.

* Your ruler will turn your mind toward more than you think.

* The tree man turned indomitable and pale.

* You'll only unravel dreams with trust.

* The numb inhabit known concepts.

* You come to be a wed but are wed in place of Pluto.

* They will find the clothes you leave on the ground.
Absence is sacred.  An unnamed relationship. Hulls
persist on emptiness air overseas. The small still voice
inside you is a transistor radio.

* Halloween, the dark is alive. Your house is in order.
Your bed is made. Leave.

I end with Western Love at which Juliana felt like she was
laughing too much because no one else was.




I sit down on the floor next to Chris
and Juliana begins to read.  She reads
Jordan says and Lisa's doing and wonders
why new york writing is against a certain kind
of abstraction.  Chris passes me a note.  Juliana
reads the poem about working in the psychiatrist's office.
She loves saying the refrain and everyone waits
to see if it's going to be different and then we all
try to answer the questions that follow about
being mean.  Answer them quietly to ourselves
I mean.




Chris reads last.  He starts with cell #103 from Jennifer's
new Imagination Verses and raves about her efficacy.
Then he does the Chris Stroffolino thing and we're all amazed.
He ends with a line about the snake in which it's
embraced as a concept.  Often I am permitted
to return to Chris Stroffolino.




After the reading Juliana and Chris are complaining
about how it's hard to read after me because
my work is so ironic.  I get mad and say
it's not ironic and walk out on the porch and smoke.
Shawn sticks her head out and says ding ding ding
and we sit and eat a dinner that Henrietta cooked
in the kitchen.  It's a good dinner.




After dinner everyone talks and smokes on the porch.
Chris explains to Ahmed how Hegel used Kant
as a club to beat Kierkegaard.  Ahmed doesn't believe
in kinds.  Teresa is a technical writer.  Patrick used to live
in a barn.  Karen tells the story of the blubbering whore.
Teresa's boyfriend talks about reading at borders.
He has invited Phil Levine to town and uses Major Jackson
as a consultant.  Sherry knows what outsourcing means.
This one is for Ron.




Sherry needs to move her car so me & her &
Juliana go to find it.  We walk the campus and Juliana
is jealous that someone gets to teach here.
Sherry explains that she and her husband go out
in state college to watch the Bulls.  She discusses
the Dennis Rodman book and likes the beginning.
However, there are no good words to describe
this beginning where Dennis has lost his Piston
friends to trades after winning it all.  Dennis is sad
and wants to quit.  He has no community and
there is no space in the NBA for tattoos and colored hair.
Well.  You know the story.  He just does it.
I wonder to myself about the veracity of Sherry's opening
lines about Dennis--that there are no good words
to describe his predicament--and conclude that Sherry
is really talking about herself.  Sherry is Dennis Rodman.




Sherry's car appears and we note it and walk around the corner
into the white dog bar.  Juliana asks me what my problem is
because I'm saying drink then car and corner and bar
and making no sense.  Juliana buys the first round
and I realize I'm having a fit.  They want to see the visual poem
so I hand it to them and walk into the bar next door because
it has a cigarette machine.  When I get back Juliana says
I'm out of control.  She is referring to the visual poem I think.




I ask Juliana how big the Jordan piece is and
she says that's how big it is.  I say I laughed
during it in response to her I want to be funny.
I say her Testimony is terrifying.  I love that.
Why do you want to be funny?  It's a dumb question
because I want to be terrifying and I'm still mad
about the ironic comment and o irony is certainly
not terrifying I say.  Western Love is about passion
and passion is often not very funny and is only ironic
to Alanis Morissette.  Passion is also terrifying because
it's everything, all at once and forever.  Moreso I say
the humor is trick just as it's a trick that I appear calm
next to Douglass.  People are also tricked by the dedication
to Jennifer a female from Bill a male but if you ignore that
and look at the poems it's often hard to figure out what genders
are conversing.  Juliana says she's noticed and then lays out
her theory.  New American writers had this creepy male I
to female you.  She loves the language poets because
they attacked this problem and destroyed that I.
Now Lee Ann's crush is making things difficult
and Juliana's students are also confused about
their genders and this imparts a new energy to the work.




Juliana asks how is Jeff?  I say Jeff is good.
He my tokie furlong.  She says in Buffalo
he was always lying like if you asked him
about the fabric of his jacket he'd say
it was made out of vanilla brain coral.
I explain that Jeff is one of the few men
I love to hug and that he gives me rocks.
Juliana says at one point Jeff had slept
with all her Buffalo roommates.  I say
I thought Jeff had a passion for local girls
who danced the polka.  Sherry & Juliana
talk about the polka.  I smoke and laugh
to myself concerning what Jeff said
about Juliana.




Sherry orders another round and tells us
about fish ladders.  I hear wacker drive
and ways to order sequences and Sherry
wonders how we answer questions about
the mainstream.  We don't we say.  Instead
Juliana talks about teaching the Next Generation
where Dharmok and Gilhad are at Tenagra.
She wants to see the aphasia virus episode
because it is about the dissolution of community.
Tenagra on the other hand means union.




Sherry drives us back to the dorm and we go
thru security with the guest passes.
They say Guest of Al Filreis.  888-89-1035.
Ex:  0-6/30/97  ACAD.  PRG.  IN  RES.

of Pennsylvania and is not transferable.
It should be carried at all times and

for replacement of a lost card.  We go to sleep.




Writer's House opens at noon and people walk in
from the hurricane and meet.  Shawn takes our orders
for cheesesteaks.  Delivery will take too long.
She and Juliana go out into the hurricane for pick up.
Louis is reading Laura Riding essays and says
she was no angel.  Who was I wonder.  Louis then
wants to look at my hat.  I hand it to him and he looks
inside and says adam.  I ask Chris about his snake line
and he says remember the don't tread on me flag?
We had a flag with snake on it.




I think about my car and run into the hurricane
behind Writer's House to look for it.  I walk back
to Writer's House and kick a beam on the porch
and laugh.  The cheesesteaks arrive.  I tell about
the car.  Juliana laughs.  The cheesesteaks are good.




Shawn has figured out where the car is
and she and Juliana have gone to a cash machine
and hailed a cab.  Chris goes in the cab too and
it's a full cab with a carribean driver who smokes
Marlboro reds.

The Sunoco balls are numbered 550 & 536
and exist in a field of cultivation.  Juliana
pays $80 as I dig out my license.  UPENN
will reimburse her when she presents the receipt.




We get lost on the drive back to campus.
My passengers hold the softballs in the back
seat and comment.  Juliana notes that one says
Fitterman and one says Douglass.  She likes the one
named Douglass.  Shawn announces she played softball
in high school and at UPENN.  Fastpitch.  I say I find
that fastpitch softball is harder to play than hardball.
We learn Shawn used to pitch and struck out lots and hit
a few batters and that made people mad until she found
her love of poetry.




We're getting more & more lost in the hurricane
and find ourselves approaching the Walt Whitman bridge.
Chris says stop stop turn around turn around
we're going to end up in Willmington
we're going to end up in Willmington.
Chris there is nowhere to stop or turn around.
Beatific Chris is agitated so a service road appears.
A sign says To Refineries and I jerk the car to the right.
Fields of numbered tanks calm us down.  We drive under
the Walt Whitman and find another service road that leads back
to the 291 and our way.  Juliana says that's the most fun
she's had in a long time.  I thank Chris for his advice.




The car we leave in a meter and head back
inside Writer's House.  Soon there will be a talk
in the livingroom.  Gil will show and Bob and Teresa
and Louis and Dave.  Josh & Shawn are managing.
Gil sits down next to me so I try and flatter him.
Your burning deck book has a lot of passion for how
sparse it is.  I tell him yes he should take it as a
complement.  The tape recorder starts.




Gil talks about Beatitude and SF in the early 70s
and kush.  He started Paper Air to talk back
to those friends when he moved to Phili.
The editors in turn say things about their mags.
Juliana Chain, Bob Hills, Dave X-Connect, Teresa Painted Bride
and Louis Hole.  Bob asks Louis about Vancouver
and Louis talks about Ottawa.




Bob asks a two-part question of the three visitors
and suddenly it's an interview.  Are you a language poet
& do you have any hostility toward language poetry.
Juliana goes first.  It's her tradition and she has no
Oedipal problems.  Her eyes look like Cal Ripken's.
Chris goes next and says he was already an ashberian
street poet before he came to language poetry and
so had a certain amount of hostility toward it.
Chris is looking right at Gil.  Why are you looking at me Chris?
We laugh.  Then I say I can't be a language poet
because I wasn't there then.  I say language poets
were some my of teachers and I was receptive to the work
because I had no poetry background having just come
from the sciences.  It wasn't all fluffy and stuff I say.
I also say that I admire their community model but don't feel
any compulsion to replicate or riff their forms.  Then I describe
Juliana's theory as a way of talking about generational difference
and feel like I've stolen her theory.  She says ya, Lee Ann is doing it
and her Bard students are confused about their genders.
Bob says but Carla and Lyn have the sex piece.
Yes they do and it's hot I say and he says Carla's deSade
piece is too & I disagree thinking it's more of a mind fuck
than a fuck fuck but instead I say it doesn't turn me on.
Bob says Ron has sex in his work.  I think Bob is waiting
for me to address the puking blow job line and I bite.
It doesn't turn me on I say.  Somehow we've gotten off
Juliana's theory and on to straight sex.  She is the only one
in the interview to say fuck.




We eat at Chili's on the Writer's House budget.
There is talk of movie star names & middle names
& meanings of last names & street names.
The food arrives and Louis ends up with the best name.
After dinner we go out into the hurricane.
We are careful to keep our umbrellas pointed
to the sources of the shifting wind.  Vance meets us
on the way in and knows about the car.




Goodbye's are said to those at Writer's House.
Louis gives the best goodbye:  Dare I say Juliana,
I've never seen you laugh so much.  There, I said it.




Josh needs to clean up the room and Chris
is getting a ride back to new york in the car.
They want to come to the room now and I want
them to wait at Writer's House.  They win and
walk to the room.  Juliana & I take the car.
Juliana says Louis is great.  Ya I say.  I fell
in love with him.  I guess we're going to have
to make him tapes when he can no longer
walk into things.




I'm soaked.  I start undressing and look at Chris & Josh
and snit you want to watch me undress?  They leave the room.
I change and feel guilty for snitting and give Josh
some books and say come stay with me in New York.
Chris comes back in the room and comments
on my changed appearance.  We sit on the floor
and try to map a route out of Phili.  We take a long time
to decide on the route.  I want to go interstate
because of the hurricane but Chris is afraid
we'll end up in Willmington.  Juliana & I
look at each other and laugh.  Chris,
we came from Willmington.




Chris is very funny on the drive home.
He says in future interviews we should
answer questions in a smart alec way
like the Beatles.  Juliana says nobody's
going to ask us when we last cut our hair.
However when I think back to the interview
Juliana did give an answer like that.  Bob
asked her what it was like to be a writer
in New York.  Juliana said there's a lot
of nice people to talk to.  What??
In New York there's a lot of nice people
to talk to.




We drop Chris in Jersey City and head to Brooklyn.
Jennifer's new books are there and I rip open
the package and look at the cover of Imagination Verses.
How french I say and swoon when I read what
she signed inside:

           For Bill --
           There will always
           be room for you
           in my heart's stable!
           Thank you for being
           ever tender.

           love,
           Jennifer

Then I read With a Preface by the Author
and laugh and love her fanciful turns and
turn to the preface.  Even The Love Poem
Agitates The Beloved To Fall In Love
With The Poet.  It's a handsome collection.
Juliana likes it.

Okay. Scratch "authenticity." Try "earned appropriation" instead. But what
would constitute such? Good point re: context & audience, Alan. As
"documents of culture," everything considered such is fair game for analysis
 - pop songs as well as poetry. Still, I'm not sure we can hold a pop song
accountable in the same way we do a poem. Its aims are different. For
instance (a broad generalization here, for which I may be crucified): songs
tend to play down to an audience, poems tend to play up. On the other hand,
when I was going through my divorce ten years ago, no poem in the world
offered me as much comfort as maudlin country songs on a jukebox in a
rundown bar. This was after a number of beers, of course. (Of course).

Subject:      Kerouac,bpNichol & listening

        There is a good Kerouac song--"Kerouac" by Willie "Loco" Alexander
and the Boom Boom Band.  (That song and "MASS.AVE" were regional Boston
hits and remain Boston radio played classics to this day.  Wiile was in The
Lost in the Sixties and later in one of last incarnations of the Velvet
Underground before forming the Boom Boom Band.Willie has a cult following
in France--the journal Nineteen did a special on him and various
collections of his work have come out on the New Rose label.)
        Alan Sondheim had a good point re listening to popular music.
Kerouac's use of popular songs as well as jazz is well known.  (See the
"Tapes" sections of Visions of Cody for example.)
        bpNichol made great use of popular music.  Karl Young has noted
bp's interest in why people liked what they liked and bp's checking out
Guy Lombardo lps as an example.
        Paul Dutton, in "bpNichol and the Past-Present of a Future Music"
(Musicworks #44) writes:  "bpNichol's taste in music was eclectic, his
love of it abiding, his appetite for it inexhaustible, his knowledge of
it broad and deep.  He was familiar equally with jazz from its roots
through to its latest developments, with the range of pop musics from the
twenties to the eighties, with Broadway and film musicals, and with the
works of contemporary composers.  He was as eager to attend a performance
of a Stockhausen work as to go to an Ornette Coleman concert, a Tony
Bennet show, or a Rod Stewart rock-up".
        bpNichol frequently cites Coleman's Free Jazz lp as having
"cleansed my ears". A range and freedom in listening opens possibilities
in writing for the poet.
        Don Cherry, who plays on Free Jazz, used to enjoy reading aloud
the poems of "Leroi Jones" while simultaneoulsy putting on rural blues
lps, Dous'n'Gouni music from Mali, early Neil Young, the theme song from
"Viva Zapata" and Melanie's "Candles in the Rain".  On "Sonny's Time Now"
you can hear Sonny Murray, Albert Ayler and Don Cherry playing with
"Leroi Jones" reading/performing.
        CDs of Kerouac reading to jazz are readily available.
"Hey, Jack Kerouac" could be a vehicle to get people/students into
listening to music in relation to writing via sounds rather than
"meaning" of lyrics.  Writing in relation to notation--which could be way
to bring in area of visual poetry as well--relation of notation of
writing to visual presentation--Kerouac's "Bookmovie is the movie in words,
the visual American form" for example.
        Kerouac in "Esssentials of Spontaneous Prose": "sketching
language is undisturbed flow from the mind of personal secret idea-words,
blowing (as per jazz musician) on subject of image".
        bpNichol from Journeying and the Returns, quoted by Dutton:

        "I place myself there, with them, whoever they are, wherever they
are, who seek to reach themselves and the other thru the poem by as many
exits and entrances as are possible".

        Might be interesting to see/hear/read what exits and entrances
could be made of/with "hey, Jack Kerouac" by using methods of notation,
sketching and blowing Kerouac and bpNichol open as possibilities in writing.

Songs can be difficult as well in a variety of ways, and it's hard to tell
where pop ends and something else begins - think of Cabaret Voltaire in
the 70s and 80s, or SPK for example. I also think of the lyrics of, say,
Gang of Four, which, as I remember, were pretty sophisticated. In any
case, these musics aren't particularly easy - just as following a solo in
heavy metal - really following it - isn't easy either.

So it becomes a matter of odd definition - what constitutes a pop song as
such? And is there pop poetry? (Joyce Kilmer, Edgar Guest, etc.?)

From:         Ira Lightman <I.Lightman@UEA.AC.UK>
Subject:      Re: How To Not Read

As a British poet, I'm amazed that nobody has
raised a small hand of reservation about Steve
Evans' review of the TLS review of Conductors of
Chaos. I don't agree at all with Mark Wallace
that Steve Evans should consider more widely
circulating this review; it just about works
in the context of this group, where, much to
my own personal regret, we experimentalists
get more of our chests as outbursts, especially
versus the mainstream, than we do engage in real debate.

I found Keith Tuma's remarks at least a little bit
informed about Britain; but I disagree entirely
that the review had a strict Movement agenda; Robert
Potts' citing of Donald Davie does not automatically
make a Movement agenda; more likely, I think, a
Davie agenda, a canon drawn from Davie's enthusiasms
like Jack Clemo, MacDiarmid, Bunting, Feinstein,
Tomlinson and Sisson; none of these poets were part
of the movement, nor benefitted from them. Steve
Evans, if you're reading this, I recommend Davie's
Under Briggflatts A History of British Poetry 1960-88,
it's much more complex and critically well written
than Potts' piece (or your own, I might as well join
this stonefight from glasshouses) and justifies Potts'
enthusiasm for Davie.

I think Steve Evans piece, as Derrida said of Freud's
reading of the Emperor's New Clothes, existed before
the review and makes very little engagement with it.
By engagement I mean what I think Davie meant about
it being counter-productive to take sides; an act
of engagement involves concession, taking criticism,
not wholesale rebuffing plus character assassination.
I don't know Robert Potts, but I think Steve Evans
has misread his tone and attacked him unfairly.
People who live in glasshouses and throw stones
at others' critical prose are exemplified by remarks
like:

"a pure example of xenophobic reading"
How pure? Xenophobic? "Hating all"? When he makes
a point of applauding some?

My reading of the review is that Potts doesn't like
capitalism either, so agrees with the aims of
the anti-capitalists in the book but questions
whether they succeed (and further speculates how
such aims might). His use of Davie's remarks about
having some respect for the person who pays for
your book *can* be sidestepped, but not by branding
Potts and Davie as collaborators in capitalism.
First of all, where's the distinction in Steve
Evans' piece between multinational capitalism
and small business? Davie's father was a shop
keeper, running a small business. Many of the
poets I, and I suspect Steve Evans, like have
come to us via thrifty small businesses ie
small presses. If you believe writing should
be given away, not sold, which is what I often
do with my writing, as a kind of ambassadorship
or discipleship of not just me but poetics,
then that too is a complication to confront
Robert Potts with. But saying he is just
conforming to the market doesn't have proper
historical or theoretical resonance as a
critique. The market in this sense is, I
assume, meant to stand for lowest common
denominator spoon-feeding. Davie didn't
advocate that, as one of the best writers on
Pound and what we have to learn about prosody
and music from Pound (which, I think, Potts
is right to say many of the Chaos poets
ignore, and mostly through inability with
prosody and music, of the sort Davie tried
hard, in his poetry small business entrepreneurship,
to remedy.)
        It's true that Potts follows (and narrows
the McDiarmid and Pound loving poetry of ideas
loving) Davie in preferring lyric poetry of place:
the poet in a landscape responding in conventional
syntax. Still, Davie had a lot to say, that the
Chaos poets could learn, about how taking the lyric
stance one can then work on the music of the
writing; it's true that this sometimes leads to
critics saying no non-conventional syntax can
have music, but that's not what Davie says about
Pound.
        Does anarchy on the page create anarchy,
freedom create freedom? Potts seems to me to ask
if the Chaos poets manage what they think or want
to do. I think he fails, badly and reprehensibly,
to acknowledge Conductors of Chaos as an overview
of a culture that sometimes does work best when
talking to itself; he just quickly pricks its
pretensions to effectiveness as a revolution. That's
why he compares Davie's idea of a civil contract
with what he sees here as a religious cult. A lot
of his review hums with the resentment and the
snooty behaviour towards outsiders that jolly well
is prevalent in a lot of avant-garde poetry events
in Britain (Cris Cheek's music and poetry events
being a notable exception). He mentions the CCCP
in Cambridge. Well, it bloody well is unfriendly
to outsiders. He mentions Andrew Duncan's essay
from Angel Exhaust because it shows an insider making
the point that it's counter-productive and uncomfortable
if you are inside and don't like brotherhood attitudes.
The scene may very well by different in the US, and
if Steve Evans has experienced rudeness from critics
about a US scene less cult-ish than I share his rage
at their over-reaction. In the UK, however, it's not
entirely unjustified. It takes a long time to get used
to the work on the page, and the public readings you
can go to here don't help; indeed, I felt like a stupid
person sitting not completely enwrapped, and indeed
I feel *braved* the surface rudeness to get something
from the poetics here. There is a difference between
surface difficulty from a poet who is respectful and
loving, and a surface rudeness from a poet who's rude
and solitary and you only get anything from them in
spite of them.

Shouldn't we be aware of predecessors? Shouldn't Eliot
be named? I can think of many, not least the more
than occasionally ranty Andrew Duncan, who could
benefit from thinking: "am I too much like Pound?
How in a good way? How in a bad way?"

I won't go on, but I feel Steve Evans has caricatured
Robert Potts as a High Establishment figure, and
that he's got him wrong, and missed some of the
good points of the review: some warnings, now these
poets are in the public domain, about why readers
who basically vote with their attendance and hard-
earned money and precious time would say some of
these things if they were articulate. That would
start the debate, and, I agree with Steve Evans
that we could reason with their prejudices, slowly
win them over, as we could never Robert Potts. But
he is giving us some means to do this with his
criticisms and ducking the criticisms means ducking
an opportunity - not to conform, but to win over.

Just reading Lisa Jarnot's new Burning Deck Press book and advise all to

Somebody (Loss?) reviewing Baraka at the Creeley bash said something
about a Littoral Books publication by Baraka -- no Littoral books to be

about this book?  Address or email of littoral??  (Tattered Cover in
Denver, for all its other merits, has practically no small press poetry!)

"bad song lyric, not a poem" -- now that's a binary opposition I'd never

good to be back on the list -- though lurking had its solitary pleasures --

Thanks for nice full post, David.

People probably also know about a Ramblin' Jack Elliott song about Kerouac,
which makes some sense, and is nowhere near stupid appropriation, because
Jack and Jack were friends in the Village long ago.

Also regarding bpNichol and his wide taste in music. He had tapes of all
the Fred and Ginger movies.

You're quite right, Aldon. We should pay _no_ attention whatever to _context_.

A text is the same whether it's a song lyric given as an example of popular
treatments of the life of Kerouac on a listserv discussion of Beat Poetry,
or given as an example of bad poetry on a listserv discussion of Important
Poetry; or to take another example, could somebody please post the Potts
piece from the TLS that Steve Evans was responding to?

I thought there were some things in the piece (and not just mild praise of
Douglas Oliver) that made it pleasantly eccentric and not unilaterally
hostile. True, Potts seemed to be calling all of Prynne's work nonsense.
Isn't there some sense in which this kind of review can be taken as high
praise?

Or, what could one say about Prynne's (or Ashbery's) work to demonstrate
how it comes close to completing thoughts and clauses, and then to point
toward I don't know a historical basis for _sublimity_?

(Is this Potts the same person who wrote _Statutes of Liberty_, a to me
hostile-seeming account of the New York School by a British critic? If so,
then...)

 No, Geoff Ward wrote _Statutes of Liberty_.  I think he would be pretty

Thanks to Ira Lightman for opening up the thread on the _Conductors of
Chaos_ review.

A couple of thoughts:

yes, we certainly should be making better distinctions (and not just the
one between e-mail and published critical prose), and confusing
shopkeepers with multinational corporations is dangerous indeed, though of
course there is a name for this confusion: Thatcherism.  Aren't there, in
any case, good reasons for resisting the plain dealing/plain talking
analogy (to hark back to Keith Tuma's point about the 'Movement'--the only
mention of Prynne in Larkin's letters is when the former is unfavorably
compared to Patience Strong, a wrongly reviled poet [Larkin says--I'm
relying on memory] who at least knew that language was there to
communicate!).

Another question: is small press poetry publishing really the same as
running a shop to make a profit?  What sort of commodity is a poem?
(there is a wonderful meditation on this in B.Catling's piece "The
Stumbling Block" included in _Conductors of Chaos_).  And don't we also
have to come up with more nuanced categories than anti-capitalist vs.
collaborator with capitalism?

Over 100 artists, writers, intellectuals, poets, theatre persons and
gallery owners, among whom were notable artists Satish Gujral, Bhabesh
Sanyal, A. Ramachandran, Manjit Bawa, Arpita Singh, Manu Parekh, Vivan
Sundaram and Jatin Das; writers and critics Bhisham Sahni, Nirmal Verma,
Krishen Vallabh Vaid, Ashok Vajpayeee, Keshav Malik and Suneet Chopra;
gallery owners Rekha Puri, Renu Modi, and Arun Vadhera; poets Manglesh
Dabral and Pankaj Singh; and theatre persons N.K. Sharma, Ram Gopal Bajaj
and film critic Aruna Vasudev, gathered in the lawns of Rabindra Bhawan to
protest against the vandalism indulged in by the Bajrang Dal at Ahmedabad
that led to the destruction of a large number of irreplaceable works of
art by the eminent painter M. F. Husain.

Speaking on the occasion, there was unanimity among artists, writers and
specialists that those who had committed this act had no comprehension of
our temple iconography or cultural traditions. They further called on the
Government of india and the state governments of Maharashtra, Gujarat and
Madhya Pradesh, to ensure that those spreading communal propaganda against
the noted painter be brought to book and the vandals punished.

To register their protestt against this unprecedented savagery, they
called for an all India Protest Day on 18th October, to be observed with
the "Closure of all art galleries, schools and institutions" and have
called on artists all over the country to fax a drawing of Saraswati or an
image of protest with their statements in support of Husain to the SAHMAT
office in New Delhi as the art world denies the right of any single
institution or set of institutions to dictate what we should paint.

The images should be faxed by Thursday 12 noon at fax numbers 011-3355845
or 011-4622017.

I've always interpreted the song as poking some gentle fun at the Beat

indetectibility of e-mailed irony is here made doubly difficult by the
transcription of sung, voiced lyrics in transcription.  Yuck.  This is not
my favorite song on the album it comes from, but hey Jordan, what about "A

I can remember talking about Cave oh 18 months ago in a thread which again
(I think started with Dylan) & I am probably going to make the same point as
I did then.........But I 'discovered' poetry in books (you know real poetry
in small press books and magazines which are really hard to get if you are
16 and don't know about the 2 trendy inner city bookshops which stocked one
or two of these magazines in the late 70s) after listening critically to
rock song lyrics (you know punk had just happened -Radio Birdman/The
Saints). I know it is really easy to dismiss people like Dylan (early) and
so on - but I think there is probably more 'cross over' than some in the
academy would care to admit.

Ah yes, first message back on the list and I've managed to attract
sarcasm already --

I believe I did read and comprehend the context of the remark about a bad
song lyric vs. a poem -- but maybe I  missed something --

Why would anybody ever think that a text is always "the same"?  I neither
think such a thing, nor suggest such in my short remark -- What I was
wondering about was  -- what is the critical context in which song lyric
(bad or good) is opposed to "poem" (bad or good / example of something in
a class or free-floating in the air, whatever -- it was an opposition
that surprised me -- still does)  I neither failed to attend to the
context nor asked that anybody else do so -- Though I did assume an
audience that had read the exchange to which I alluded --I'll confess to
that --

Ira--

Surely you wouldn't disagree that _Purity of Diction in English Verse_ (1952)--
the Davie book cited by Potts--was crucial to the "Movement"?  Otherwise
there's just the journalism of Larkin, etc.  The fact that Davie attacked the
Movement a few years later, the fact that _Under Briggflatts_ is a very
different book (might as well plug my now-ancient review of it in Contemporary
Literature, written before I had read most of the poets in _C of C_)--all this
is beside the point.  Those folks you mention Davie as having supported
(Bunting, for instance, but very much Davie's Bunting) are nowhere mentioned in
Potts' review.  The blunt opposition Potts makes between "Davie's civic
contract" and a "more religious covenant with the faithful" seems to me to
1) erase Davie's work post-conversion and (more importantly) 2) make Iain
Sinclair's interests and framework representative of a very diverse group of
"avant-garde" poets.  Allen Fisher, for instance, was explicitly critical of
Sinclair in his review of _A Various Art_, which Davie also reviewed by the
way, taking the opportunity to say that he wished his former student Prynne
would say what he was up to and that, well, Douglas Oliver and a few others
in that earlier anthology were okay and the anthology should be applauded.

Besides, I never said that Potts' values were exactly those of the "Movement,"
but rather an extension of them, a frame expanding slightly in order to
contain some of that which challenges it so as not to break. Besides Oliver
it's Tony Lopez, Barry MacSweeney, Michael Haslam, Andrew Crozier, Lee Harwood,
and Denise Riley he singles out for praise.  I imagine that, with more time
than I have tonight, one could easily figure out why he has room for these
poets and not Brian Catling, cris cheek, Allen Fisher, Peter Riley, Prynne,
Bill Griffiths, Caroline Bergvall, Allen Fisher, Prynne, etc. These are the
poets, apparently, who "clearly have no ear at all."  These are the poets who
"will no doubt be satisfied that their work is simply too good for most
readers, and return to their worthy isolation."  Potts' equation of
marginalization with willful elitism--take that you snotty rats, back to your
holes--this is, for me, one of the most frustrating motifs in his review. On
the back of some reading in Andrew Duncan's prose he's also caricatured
"Cambridge," it seems to me, and falsely linked everybody in the book with
Prynne's procedures.  He's heard talk of what others have called "a convention
of critical silence" and imagines he's found a motive for it:  up to now these
poets have only wanted to talk with one another. Now he will stand in for the
public, offering a "fresh and foreign critical interrogation" to counter their
whispering, deciding who should be allowed to speak rather than whisper. It's
ironic that his critique of some of the work in _C of C_ is very much indebted
to the criticism of a poet whose work he has no use for--Drew Milne--and also,
more broadly (it seems to me) to Prynne and others associated with "Cambridge"
who in criticizing the propositions of langpo poetics have been insistent in
arguing that "the more common response" to "a disrupted and dehiscent
information vortex" is "simply to choose to read something else."

I said earlier that Potts is not "obtuse"--so I agree with you on that score.
And I'm no more a fan of the chest-thumping among the avant-garde than you are,
apparently:  it does seem to me that there's a reluctance among experimental
poets and their supporters to write critically about one another, perhaps
especially in the US.  And the so-called 'mainstream' is regularly caricatured,
as if Frank Bidart, Dana Gioia, and Sharon Olds were one and the same poet.
But when I notice the silence that is the US mainstream's critical approach to
nearly all alternative poetries, or when I read Robert Potts consigning 85%
of the poetry in _C of C_ to oblivion because of its purportedly "willed
incoherence" and its "hideous extremes" I think that I understand why the
rhetoric among some of those on this list sounds the way it does.  This is not
to explain or justify Steve Evans' remarks about "xenophobia" or "capitalism"--
Steve will surely speak for himself.

nothing to do with all genres being "equal," though even what that means
(equal to each other in what regard?) unclear -- but my original point
was simply that I had always thought that lyric was in fact a genre of
poetry, and that I hadn't thought to see them thus opposed to one another
on a "poetics" list -- Perhaps part of the problem here, my having been
absent so long from the discussions in question, is that my comment is
now read in the light of discussions I was not involved in???

no hierarchical comment intended with regard to other lists anywhere --

nor any argument for absolute relativism, the which I continue to find
untenable --

I was chilled when chilling wasn't cool --

The only composer I can remember being quite so blunt about, at least on
poetics-list (I'm much more opinionated in real life), is Stockhausen.
Though I can certainly imagine that I may not have referred to Mr Eno with
the same degree of respect he often receives.

Nick Cave, on the other hand, didn't he re-invent the Child ballads?

Subject:      Conductors of Chaos

The latest Poetry Review has a special number (amazingly enough) on
modernism, postmodernism etc called "Strange Attraction". First off
is a rev of C of C by Ian Samson who is positive about the
poetry but (rightly I think) very robust about the introduction. And
his remark that chaos can be judged on how good the conducting is
and shouldn't just rely on the consistency of chyme (a an
acidic stomach residue)seem s fair general comment( general is as
general does) as well as a momentary resourceful counter-rhetoric. See
also keith Jebb on innovatory magazines and Stephen Burt on
Langpo.Although designed to be accessible, none of this is throw-away
or crabby infighting. It's the sort of issue from PR that would have
been unimaginable until quite recently. There is even a poem from
Drew Milne.

Subject:      Hit Lyrics

Aldon -- I suppose to be etymological about it you're right, that 'lyric'
mode is a subset of 'poems.' However. I hear differences between N.
Merchant and T. Campion? Between R. Zimmerman and R. Grenier? Differences
which imply 'generic drift'? If of course a poem is words broken up into
lines then there is no difference -- no visible difference -- between a
'song lyric' and a 'poem'. But, to be less implicated in damaged forms of
categorization, the set of conventions for reading (hearing) a song lyric
is so distinct from those for hearing (reading) a poem -- things float
differently in those different media -- that to look at one as either
'equal to' or 'subordinate to' the other is I think in the same free range
where a poem can be thought of as not enough like a personal essay. Which
is not to say there is no profitable interplay between 'song lyric' and
'poem'. John Taggart's work comes to mind, as do David Shapiro's, Anselm
Berrigan's, and Chris Stroffolino's -- but those works seem to borrow from
musical strategies of sampling, dub, minimalism, extended remix -- to take
a salient moment from a 'song lyric', or rather an area of overlap between
'song lyric' and 'poem' -- and riff. Now Steve Carll's _Sincerity Loops_ is
a suite of poems founded on a different, textual principle -- reassembled
from song lyrics one word at a time.

        IT'S RAIN

        I hear rain-shines show when mind comes,
        if you hear, and the sun.
        If lemonade shines it, everything's weather's state, might slip.
        The same "they" that sip rain can run sun into you.
        Fine, show that the weather's me can hide their mind.
        If the sun starts, comes, and the dead,
        they can hear rain, they don't shine.
        Comes their rain, the shines of it to the you; when can I rain me?
        The fine shines show and I don't shine rain when you can.
        Well as rain when mind-shade heads just be.
        The I rain I; the me rains a you when you can.


                                                _for John Lennon_


I hope Steve doesn't mind my using him this way. And if I'm misreading his
project when I suggest that his discovery of subatomic particles of meaning
in 'song lyrics' is directly connected to his transformation of 'song
lyrics' into 'poems' then I hope Steve (or someone) will say so. [It's
possible that Steve thinks of this poem not as transformation or
translation but rather as cento. In which case, my bust.]

As for 'absolute relativism' being untenable, Aldon, I'm sure you're right,
but I'm not sure which absolute relativism you're saying I'm trying to
hold. Are you saying that I'm describing the genres of 'song lyric' and
'poetry' in a way that has overtones of 'separate but equal'? Or that to
describe the differences between 'song lyrics' and 'poems' is to engage in
a kind of literary cranium measurement? Or that line-broken texts which are
good are poems, and line-broken texts which are bad are songs? Why you
wanna treat me so bad when you know I love you?

Subject:      Keith Tuma and "chest thumping"

        While I can't claim to know in detail the problems of English
poetry that Keith Tuma and Ira Lightman are debating on this list, I do
greatly object to the characteriziation that Keith makes of "chest
thumping" among "experimental poets," as well as his just plain wrong
suggestion that experimental poets in the U.S. are not critical of each
other. I don't think I really need suggest what is wrong with reducing a
whole body of contemporary critical writing by experimental poets to some
sort of cliche about primitive macho posturing; nonetheless, Keith, if you
think recent critical work by writers like Ron Silliman, Leslie Scalapino,
Charles Bernstein, Nathaniel Tarn, Barrett Watten, Juliana Spahr, Lew
Daly, John Noto, Charles Borkhuis, Jefferson Hansen, myself and many
others can be reduced to some sort of
singular "thumping" about our shared value, then you haven't been reading
very closely.

        Let me, just in case this doesn't seem clear to you, suggest a
number of texts you might read that totally bely the suggestion that
"American"
"experimental poets" (whatever they are, exactly) are not critical of each
other, although it seems to me that you've been on this list long enough
perhaps to perceive that not everybody out here is in agreement. Please
read, for instance, the highly contentious discussion between Charles
Bernstein and Ron Silliman in Content's Dream; please read the collection
Juliana, Kristin Prevallet, Pam Rehm and I edited, A POETICS OF CRITICISM,
with particular attention to pieces (for this context) by Lew Daly,
Jefferson Hansen, and Susan Schultz; please read POETIC BRIEFS #19 with my
essay on postlanguage poetry and the various responses to it that appeared
in Poetics Briefs #20; please read Charles Borkhuis' essay in ONTHEBUS on
the relation between surrealism and language poetry; please read ALL the
introductions to the magazine Apex of the M; please recall, if you will,
the intense discussions on this poetics list between Ron Silliman, Steve
Evans, Juliana Spahr,
myself and others about the value of "postlanguage" poetry; please read
recent issues of TALISMAN with attention to the work of John Noto and
Leonard Schwarz as well as the recent highly contentious debate between
Marjorie Perloff and some others on "language poetry bashing," please read
the almost brand new work by Hank Lazer and Bruce Andrews now out from
Northwestern (is that right folks, please help here).

        While I'm tempted to have some sympathy for Ira Lightman's
position about Donald Davie (despite the fact that Davie's now infamous
article on Lorine Neidicker is about as close to macho "chest thumping"
as contemporary poetics criticism gets), Ira loses my sympathy entirely
when he starts characterizing the "experimental" poetry "scene" as the
SOURCE of the negative feelings and in-breeding that he suggests limit or
perhaps even destroy the potential significance of "experimental poetry."
I suppose I am sorry, Ira, if someone in that community was meaner to you
(and perhaps to others) than he should have been, but the stance of a sort
of wounded innocent that you take towards that hostility is really pretty
tough to swallow. Any idea WHY experimental poets in Britan might be
hostile,
Ira? Could it be that for 20-30 years writers like Tom Raworth, J.H.
Prynne and many others after and around them have consistently been
subject to the sort of willful misreading of their intentions that Potts
seems so clearly guilty of? What have they to expect from these people
but more mistreatment, further willful misunderstanding, and constant
attempts to deny them resources and public platforms?

        Your own call for censorship at the beginning of your post, Ira,
makes clear to me exactly where your own sympathies finally lie. Steve
Evans may be incorrect about certain details regarding the context of
Potts' review, and  for that he should certainly be challenged. But it's
blatantly apparent that Potts is equally incorrect about many details
also. And yet, Ira, you make your point of view quite clear; by all means,
let Potts speak in the Times, and defend Potts wherever possible, but no,
no, don't even suggest that Steve Evans should publish his response in the
same forum, because, after all, he doesn't really understand, and
therefore shouldn't be allowed broad public access at all.

just a quick note to say that i think ira's post, and jeremy's, and
keith's, and peter's and... are bringing out salient points re steve evan's
analysis/parody... i don't know mself enough about the british scene to say
anything pertinent, so i'm content to lurk and listen and learn...

one thing though:  perhaps steve can actually *use* the material being
presented here ex post facto?... i mean, if steve were to agree with ira,
in part, that certain of his assertions were tilted too contra (or too pro
experimental), why then no reason he couldn't revise his own writing (and
thinking), right?...

i guess i'm saying that what steve gave us wasn't a published document
(though i'd love to see it published side-by-side with potts' piece---or as
a rejoinder)... in essence, his gesture---of submitting to this forum
something for our consideration---was at the very least the result of some
careful thinking and writing... and perhaps we might approach his
contribution, whatever our reservations, as something that might profit
from our input?...

just a thought, albeit a bit pedantically put//

best,

There is cross over both poetry and writing to msuc, exp. punk and jazz, and
to some extent to the academy.  Burroughs and Tom Waits recent-ish
collaboration (Dark Rider) is only one example.  Waits is a good poet and I
myself like Nick Cave, though have not read his novel.  And Jeff and a guy
named Billy Joe Harris here have taught undergrad lit classes on
music/noise/jazz and its aesthetics and relation to writing (such as Baraka)
and reading.   Song lyrics, like (as) poems, can be good or bad writing, it
seems to me.  But, just as importantly, I think the music (underground,
punk, "alternative", jazz) itself--its noise, its fragmentation, its
rhythms, its dissonances--has had a great deal of impact on my own writing,
and I assume on others.  Look at Larry Ochs (Rova Sax) and Lyn Hejinian.  xs

Gee, thanks, Mark, for the bibliography.  Actually, I've read nearly all of the
essays you mention--from Ron and Leslie's exchange through Tarn's essay on
"new forms" up through the Apex manifestos and _A Poetics of Criticism_. I've
watched Bob P and Charles B and Barry W slug it out, etc.

It was not my point that the so-called "experimental" poetry scene is
monolithic, uncontested turf.  It's simply too small a pie for that ever to be
the case, though I think that one might very well identify moments of more or
less consensus.  The last few years have clearly seen less, as langpo no
longer requires the tactical solidarity necessary to secure an audience.  My
point is that, often, such critique operates with the working assumption that
it is not necessary even to engage the so-called "mainstream" except in the
most superficial, caricatured manner.  This is, in my view, a self-defeating
tactic (and I speak as a supporter of many of the poetries you mention). It
allows those folks to ignore you; it breeds silence and contempt; it makes
a wounded rhetoric of marginalization faintly comic.  If one wants to inhabit
the margins as a tactic or a matter of principle, that's one thing.  If one
one wants to complain about the "marginalization" of experimental writing and
not engage the so-called "mainstream" with some precision, contesting its
claims on public space and the "center," that's another.

The situation in the UK, as far as I understand it, is very different. Until
very recently, "experimental" poetry has not had there the academic base of
support related or (to some degree) similar poetries have managed to secure
(thanks to the labors of Marjorie P and others) in the US.  The best British
reader of Tom Raworth, for instance, is probably John Barrell, who I believe
works as an art historian.  And the "mainstream" there--for this reason as
well as many others--seems more static, less fluid, though what Peter Larkin
says about the _Poetry Review_ (a mainstream journal if ever there was one)
is encouraging.

I'll close with a quote from Ron Silliman:  "The term academic poetry inhibits
those who use it from developing a fully nuanced reading of the very writing
it seeks to identify.  How are we to distinguish a Bill Knott or a James Tate
from a Timothy Steele or a Frank Bidart?"

I'd wager that the very rhetoric of your post nearly makes my case.

I thought it was interesting that _Ark_, as published by Passages, now

culminating in a roof or dome --what he had already published as _RADI OS_ ,
the writing through by erasure of Paradise Lost .

        Thanks to Tom Mandel for his po/em/st.
        Tom Mandel writes: "easy to confuse/saying 'I want the edge'/with
what you may really mean: 'I want to be the center'"
        Pascal noted that God is a circle whose center is everywhere and
circumference nowhere.  He also noted that it is not the elements which
are new but the order of their arrangement. (If Pascal's God is a worn
out concept to readers, note that M. Pascal's probability theorems are
still in use today;  i.e. his work continues to be useful whether his God
is or is not.)
         Tom Mandel points towards a working
with elements rather than the imposition of categories.  Stuart Hall
writes of "articulation" as an arrangement of elements to produce
something "new" or what Pascal calls that which is "previously
unavailable to memory".  As an example Hall gives the British "articulated
lorry" in which a truck cab is joined to a truck bed or trailer useful
for moving things.
        Mandel writes:  "Energy spent on what to leave out/--and how and
why--/makes the space smaller./  /Energy expended on what to
include--and how and why/to include more--/makes the space larger."
        Like the Dadaists in painting, poetry,and performance William Carlos
Williams noted that anything
can be used to make a poem. Russolo in the Italian futurist manifesto on
Noise indicates that anything may be used to "amplify" and extend the
sounds available to music. (Opening up the making of 'new' instruments as
well as of "new" noises/sounds--Harry Partch a later example for
instance, as well as Cage and Tudor et al.) Filmmakers have long used
elements taken from
stock footage, stock sound recordings, "amateur" "home movies"and used
them with "directed" elements, sets, actors to open film spaces.  (think
of Kenneth Anger's use of popular songs, tv broadcast Hollywood movies
and so on in "Scorpio Rising" as one example among hundreds.) Sampling in
music and "referencing" in videos extend, expose and exploit
the possibilities and contradictions in the articulation of elements.
        In "How Are Verses Made" Mayakovsky notes that it is not
the evaluation of work from the standpoint of literary taste that is
useful, but the study of the productive process.
        "How are verses made?
        Work begins long before one receives or is aware of a social command.
        Preliminary work goes on incessantly . . .

        A poet regards every meeting, every signpost, every event in
whatever circumstance simply as material to be shaped into words".

        Distinctions and abstract categories--Mandel's "energy spent on what to
leave out/--and how and why"--impose traffic limits so to speak on where,
when, how fast or slow, how far or freighted Hall's "articulated lorry"
may go. To separate song lyrics from "the" lyric "makes the space
smaller" as Mandel writes.  It is not song lyric in opposition to "the"
lyric which is useful, but their apposition as elements and materials.

        In "bpNichol and the Past-Present of a Future Music"  Paul
Dutton opens by quoting from bpNichol's The Martyrology, Book 1":

        a future music moves now to be written

        w g r & t

        its form is not apparent

        it will be seen

        Later in the essay (in Musicworks #44) Dutton writes:

        "Throughout his oeuvre, pop-song lyrics recur and, judging from
Nichols' treatment of them in public readings, he intends the melody to
be heard, if only in the reader's head.  These pop-song quotes usually
occur as fragments arising in the associative flow of the poetry.  For
instance, in The Martyrology, Book 6, reflecting on the birth of his
daughter he writes 'when the selves merge / a new self emeges / we /
"three are not alone" ', in which passage the 'three are not alone' would
be sung to the appropriate portion of the melody of the Inkspots' 'My
Echo, My Shadow and Me".  Elsewhere in Book 6, he inserts original lyrics
of a C&W-style love-song to his wife, obligingly supplying notation of
the melody."

        The "articulation" of elements, rather than their control through
the imposing of categories derived from abstractions and taste, "makes
the space larger" as Mandel writes.
        Mandel also writes:  "the mind at once dictator of formal
synthesis/ and razor shaving subject where/ every location is also a margin".

        A circle with center everywhere and circumference nowhere articulated
in arrangments of elements opens possibilities, listenings, notations,
"lyrics"--
        bpNichol, quoted by Dutton:

        "I place myself there, with them, whoever they are, wherever they
are, who seek to reach themselves and the other thru the poem by as many
exits and entrances as are possible".

        Thanks to Tom Mandel for noting "as many exits and entrances as
are possible" " 'In Every Grain of Sand' "

Damn, I NEVER said you were committed to absolute relativism -- I said
that I was not -- as in, I don't go around suggesting that all genres are
equal (precisely because I don't know what that might mean and do not
believe it) --

my original point was simply that song lyrics are a kind of poetry --
whatever drift we may celebrate or condemn in whatever genre of verse we
speak of, I'd rather not get into the business of expelling genres from
the category of "poetry," particularly on the basis of my not much caring
for some instances of the genre --

I think Robert Bly's prose poems pretty much, as my students are fond of
saying, suck -- But I think I'd better have some other grounds than
quality before I declare that they are not poems --

"I started out on Nick Cave but soon hit the harder stuff."

"I started out on John Cage but soon hit the harder stuff."

Thanks to Ira. Gets me going.
I'm wanting to extend one particular section of
his post on conduits. Before that though I'm glad that
Conductors of Chaos is attracting so much contradictory
press. Almost every reviewer wants to salvage one
contributor or another from the consignment to oblivion.
Discussion is being generated. My problem with the
anthology is its white blanket, another chance to
build more awkward alliances gone blowing. Agenda's need
to be forged with such forefront, work needs to be
written to make such agendas possible. Readings /
Conferences / Festivals / audiences need to be
considered in such lights. Peritext yes and context
and pretext. Every aspect of production, positionality
and interaction. It's all editing or marketing or
curating. There is no purity and no escape. No pre-tense.

Then to Ira:

In England there are at least four 'brotherhood' poetry
hoods, that I can identify. These are broad 'hoods', each
employing a differing club ethos for bonding.

 One is the CCCP (Cambridge Conference of Contemporary
Poetry) scene  -  often featuring strong poets but with a
standoffish sociality. My sense is that with some of the
younger people there (such as Simon Perill) getting involved,
the stony edifice is cracking a little. Let it not be imputed
that there are no parties at CCCP  -  I too have been in
Prynne's study when he breaks open a case of wine and
plays Chinese music on the stereo. But that's an inside
track, many never get invited. (aren't most scenes like
this really?) Head over body.

Second there is the so-called London grouping (of which
I was, maybe am still considered, a part). The London
stance is/was certainly more critical in regard to the lyric
'I' than at CCCP  -  more Lang-po friendly, and readings
tended more towards the performative, even mixed media.
Sometimes, mea culpa, London readings could be punky
and bolshy and high energy engagements (not for eberyone).

Third there is Apples and Snakes and its affiliates. More
of a Slam crowd for Identity politics in rap and dub style
performance. I've read there and enjoyed it, but recognise
that there can be a tendency to consign those who don't like
their poetry up front and in yer face, with rockin rithums and rimes,
as hopeless high brow aesthetes.

Fourth, the cheese and wine with book signing hushed reverence,
in the presence of the poet, literary event, at which the
coseting with sentimental middle class romanticism (poems about
fine wines, net curtains and the latest translation of Virgil)
can be equally alienating.

Ira's point, made via Davie, about the interface with 'the public'
being a place of considerable responsibility and demanding awareness of
issues around access is worth noting.

How does this resonate with stateside audiences?

love and love

A book of this title and subtitle could easily have been
published at almost any date in the twentieth century. No
critical fashion would have excluded it, and in any earlier
generation, at least, it would have been relatively easy to
calculate its contents, or at least to delimit them once a
hint were given. This book is about Dante and Petrarch and
Jim Morrison and Eric Clapton: and they are only its
pretexts, for the range of its cultural contexts and its
concerns is far wider. It is in the end a book about
ourselves as readers.

Columbus departing Spain for his first great voyage at just
the moment that the last of the exiled Jews are departing
Spain from a neighboring harbor. The coincidence in time and
certain other traces not often heretofore insisted upon evoke
the possibility that Columbus himself, though not at that
moment strictly an exile from the place of his departure, was
equally an exile from his ancestry and religion -- Columbus
the Jew? The possibility cannot be simply scoffed away, and
it becomes the point of departure for meditations about the
link between the self in exile and the selves that preceded
it.

Menocal is on familiar territory, for her earlier work has
roamed neighboring waters, on the boundaries between Islamic
and Christian middle ages. Indeed her theme (see her earlier
<i>The Arabic Role in Medieval Literary History</i>) has been
that we too readily accept Islamic/Christian as a conceptual
dichotomy that implies and necessitates cultural boundaries.
But she is deft in deploying the poetry called
<i>muwashshahat</i> (mixing Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin in the
same songs) and the dazzling range of works of Ramon Llull to
bring alive the ambiguity and the richness of what was rather
on her presentation a meeting and mingling place than a
boundary.

The facts of the case, however, are pretext for the book's
central concern: how we talk about the facts of this, and
other, cases. "Philology" is the object under dissection, and
it is given pitiless and almost always fair-minded scrutiny.
The patron saints of the book (in a medieval kind of way:
they loom over it without necessarily either winning our
veneration or conferring their approval) are Auerbach, who
believed in Romance culture, and Curtius, who believed in
Latin culture. The one was an exile of extraordinary self-
possession, the other a slightly furtive non-exile. (The
self-consciousness of Auerbach's exile can best be seen, I
think, in that in his first years in Istanbul in the late
1930s, he and his wife -- whose status as a banker's daughter
presumably brought some protection -- left exile for summer
holidays in their old mountain haunts in Germany every year.
The innocence that could be displayed in the shadow of the
beast remains one of the most appallingly endearing things
about that time.)

The upshot of Menocal's explorations (by now Dante is the
text on the table) is a lucid exposition of the relativism of
our positivisms, the way in which our most fervently-espoused
practices of truth-finding have been their own best
commentary and worst enemy. Menocal clearly stands against
Grand Narratives and with the postmoderns.

At this point the book turns sharply in an unaccustomed
direction, and Eric Clapton appears. This is the early
Clapton, and his chief performance for our purposes is
<i>Layla</i>, recorded in 1972 under the <i>nom de bande</i>
Derek and the Dominos, with not only Clapton but also Duane
Allman lending memorable and crashingly vivid guitar
accompaniment. There is an eery appositeness to evoking this
text -- and text it is here. The name Layla (to veil a real-
life love, no less than "Lesbia" did for Catullus) comes from
medieval Persian legend, the name of the beloved of the lover
Majnun, driven as mad as Clapton -- in the last stanza of his
song -- fears being driven. Elsewhere on the same album a
short and hypnotically lyrical song "I am yours" offers the
clue to the connection in an album note that attributes the
song to Clapton and "Nizami" -- a medieval Persian poet. Some
will find the touch a little less light through these pages,
but Menocal is still resolute and firm of grip on her theme,
limning a lyric mode of exile and rejection which crosses
still the old east/west boundaries as she spins a web from
Persia to Miami.

>From there it is a short leap to Petrarch, the serious writer
who was also a balladeer, and back to Jim Morrison, buried in
Paris after a career as poet and troubadour -- of a sort.
Here again, summary does little favor to the discussion,
which is never quotidian and always enriched by a wider sense
of connections in many directions.

That sense of connectedness is Menocal's great strength and
it persists throughout what could otherwise have been a
disjointed and unconnected book. Her style is easy, personal,
and at the same time based on penetrating vision that the
reader is happy to share.

The weakness of the book is one that one little expects: its
traditionalism. Traditional practices to be sure are here in
abundance, always bracketed very decorously, but that is not
what I mean. Instead I point to a deeper implicit Romanticism
that remains strongly if silently on display in this book as
it does in much else of our critical literature today. The
last vestige of the Romantic passion lies in the assumption
that literature, the literary text and its connections to
other texts and even to real life, is the appropriate place
in which to ground a connected sense of human community. To
reduce Clapton and Morrison to the level of a Dante or a
Petrarch (for all that they enliven the pages of a scholarly
book, pressing them into the pages of a scholarly book leaves
much of them aside -- and to be sure, Menocal is strong on
emphasizing that Dante and Petrarch are similarly "reduced"
as we receive them) is a sign of how very important the
underlying exercise remains: to exalt "literature" by
bringing it under scholarly control. Literature, finally for
Menocal, is still worth talking about. That which is not
generally thought of as high literature -- like the
<i>muwashshahat</i> -- exists to be rescued, revived, and
revered.

Accordingly, the philological practices that she brackets so
meticulously will in the end suck her in with them. This book
does not self-consciously bracket itself, but the effect is
almost the same. It is, to be sure, the only scholarly book
that I have ever reviewed that led me to the record store to
weigh the versions and buy the album. I bought the original,
while retaining a decadent affection for the later
"unplugged" avatar of the same song by Clapton -- no longer
driving electric chords, but a meditative, almost melancholy,
acoustic rendition. In indulging that secret affection, I
fall away from the philological purity of this book. For it
was the textualization of the song in its 1972 version that
subjects the later version, in Menocal's words, to a
"purist's disdain". That tastefulness is at its heart
profoundly philological, and in the end that is the
revelation of this book: to be unphilological or
postphilological is still to be philological. To be
postmodern is not yet to be anything quite new or different.

Marisa,

I should have checked this first.  In "A Note on ARK" at the back of _ARK 50_
(Dutton, 1984), he writes:

     "The model in my head includes 3 books of 33 sections:  The Foundations,
The Spires, and The Outworks, then eventually that rewriting of _Paradise
Lost_ by excision (the first 4 sections published in 1977 as _RADI OS_) which
when complete will mark ARK 100 -- conceived as a kind of Dymaxion Dome over
the whole."

Last time I heard him read was late 80's or early 90's at an earlier
incarnation of Small Press Traffic. I don't believe it was recorded, but may
have been. He was reading from the then unpublished Arches to an audience of
maybe 10.  (They were being circulated then. Are these the mimeos you refer
to?)  I think that an earlier reading at Natoma Street, curated by Aaron
Shurin & David Levi Strauss, was recorded. Aaron, are you still here?  I seem
to remember him making remarks about the structure at both events, though
it's been a while now.

There is no mention of any additional sections in the back notes of the new
Living Batch edition, where he talks of the book being based on "trinities,"
so I guess he dropped the idea & the poem ends with ARK 99:  "countdown for
Lift Off."

(& yes, the publication history of this poem is a sad story, but one I don't
care to get into.)

Ron did read for our Works and Words series back in, oh, '82 or so, but
the recordings from that series, I think, are in some dispute - or were -
and though Levi may finally have secured them (which would be great) I'm
not sure that happened. BUT, luckily, ye old Poetry Center sponsored a
Johnson/Gunn reading in '90, and you can hear and see the ark-itecture
rise from numbers 21,22,23,34,52,57,71 and 83.

And I do mean rise!

Subject:      What experimental poets do to the mainstream

Keith Tuma:

        The problem that I still have with the position you're taking is
that, despite the apparent reasoned objectivity of your tone, you're still
engaging in the sort of wholesale, unaccurate generalizations about
"experimental poetry" that you claim that experimental poets do to the
mainstream. Yet shouldn't you be wary of making that generalization, and
isn't the apparent "objectivity" of your tone in fact enabling you to
cover up that you are engaging in such massive generalizations? I wish you
would, in fact, point out to me the articles in which experimental poets
are making the kinds of generalizations about mainstream poets that you
claim they are making--I'm frnkly not as sure you as you are that those
claims are being made.

        Thus, for all your claims to be "supporting" the sort of writing
that I and others are committed to writing, you seem in your recent posts
to admonish the avant garde to always be specific about the work of
mainstream writers, while engaging in generalizations about the nature of
what avant garde poets are doing. You insist that generalizations should
not be made about "them" while at the same time making generalizations
about those people you claim to be supporting. I'm sorry if this makes me
a little testy, but I can't help it--and while you may have a point in
taking me to task about the rhetorical nature of my response to you, isn't
it clear to you that your refernce to avant garde "chest thumping" is
highly rhetorical also, and perhaps even offensive? I greatly appreciate
your willingness to detail the issues of the British poetry context in
response to Steve Evans and Ira Lightman, and I wish, since you seem
well-informed about experimental practice in this country also, that you
would reconsider whether it's wise to make generalizations about the kind
of generlizations that experimental poets are making.

I have been, and remain, perfectly willing to discuss the sort of poetry I
write with more "mainstream" poets, and anybody else for that matter, and
I believe that in fact that is the case for almost all the "experimental"
poets I know. The question is whether "experimental" poets are even
allowed to engage in that sort of discussion in the first place. My
experience tells me NO; my work and the work of many others is regularly
condemned as unreadable, pointless word play. There is no free and open
ground of debate about the relation between experimental and mainstream
poetry in the U.S quite simply because those people who control the vast
majority of poetry resources are quite simply not going to let
experimental poets have more than even the smallest piece of those
resources, if that. Thus there is no ground of "open" discussion--the
ground begins with "objective" insults to experimental poetry, and then a
call for those "experimental" poets to justify themselves to those who are
insulting them. And it seems to me that despite your obviously worthwhile
intentions, you're conceding too much of that ground already, with your
suggestion that "experimental poets" must always explain themselves
rationally and calmly to those who have STOLEN what limited resources for
literature there are in this country. As far as I'm concerned, they should
be justifying that theft to me and to others, something that they probably
cannot do.

I'm very pleased that you have read the wide variety of poetics relevant
to this issue, and again, would just ask you to consider whether the
stereotypes about experimental poets that you seem to be putting forward
in recent posts are really the best way to achieve your own goals, which
I'm quite certain are worthwhile.

The modem I'm working on today does not allow me to correct writing errors
effectively; I hope you will excuse me for that.

Mark Wallace

Mark, I don't want to barge into or start another slanging match on these
issues, but I just can't agree with the picture you draw here.  First of
all, do "experimental" poets have to sign on to this embattled scenario?
Seems to me that "experiment" has been a pretty strong wave in US arts
since the Armory Show.  There are lots of magazines where experiments can
be published; quite a few universities where poets can get accredited
for their experiments; lots of places to read & conferences to attend;
book publishers; talk shows like the poetics list; etc.  Secondly,
if you're going to call yourself "experimental" you can't at the same
time claim all the good seats at the culture-vulture circus.  Maybe
the analogy to science is weak... but does a scientist demand the Nobel
while he or she is still doing the experiments?  It seems to me that
when you set up mainstream/experimental as an agonistic contest then
the "embattled" outfit is inevitable.  It does seem clear that in
the history of arts, the "new" does have to struggle against
established forms to win a place, people do get neglected.  Tell
me if I'm wrong though - I don't see the French painters, say the
Impressionists & those that followed, whining about their lack of
recognition & power.  They were too busy painting (& maybe striking
deals).  When they put on their independent shows, they shocked
people - but also began to win them over.  Rather than setting up
a global theory of experimental/political arts revolution, which
it seems to me is likely to lead to the paradoxical CORRUPTION
of artistic drives & motives, I would think it more important
to focus on making poetry that PLEASES oneself in the fullest
sense - & not worry about the consequences so much. Finally, in my
view, to set up some kind of simple distinction between experimental
& mainstream would have the sad effect of hobbling real experiment.
The impressionists knew & even admired the work of their academic forebears
pretty thoroughly.  - Henry Gould

Interestingly, Mark spent a fair amount of time decrying the faux objective
tone of defenses of the mainstream in response to Steve's piece & then lapsed
into just such generalizations when it came to the issue of resources. I
think the reason for this is that the generalizations become accurate when
issues of resources are raised. Mr Gould wrote:

There are lots of magazines because the people engaged in the writing are
willing to spend their time & money on them. Most of them do not receive
institutional support of any kind. This is true of many reading venues as
well. There are not a lot of universities that support the generalization
"experimental." I can think of 5, two of which, Naropa & New College, were
started by poets. It seems to me no one has refuted the basic gist of the
original post by Mr. Evans, & it would seem that the reason for this is that
he was, & is, in fact, correct.

I was under the impression that there had been quite a bit of such

After many years of attempting to ford the mainstream, I, like Rod,
started a publication to assist others whose backs were as wet as my own --

Then, what do you suppose happened?  My wife got a Ford fellowship!

Just read a book on postmodernism in which there is not only not a single
ref. to any poetry, but no discussion of any "experimental" -
"innovative" -- or even out of the ordinary in terms of the actual
writing writing -- Seems it's all a matter of thematics %^$*^%#*%^#$

Is Bob Dylan the only "popular" musician most people on this list won't
simply dismiss out of hand, the way I've seen done with Natalie Merchant,
Nick Cave, Oasis, etc.?  OK, Nick's schtick gets a bit melodramatic at
times, and he can be Gothic to the point of silliness, but he's certainly no
anathema to art or anything.  Check out "Weeping Song" from _The Good Son_.
It's simple and minimally-arranged, yet the spare keyboards and haunting
lyrics send real chills up my spine.  And while I haven't read _The Ass Saw
The Angel_ (or do I have the nouns back-asswards?  Anyway, that book he
wrote), I think it's kind of interesting that he was interested in writing
in a deliberately archaic diction.

If I'm not mistaken, "popular" music was originally defined as anything that
wasn't "classical" music.  Meaning that it would have been applied to folk,
jazz, blues, and show tunes (they didn't have rock back then, nor yet, I
don't think, rhythm to go with their blues).  There has historically been a
considerable amount of liberation to be found in making music which gets put
into this category as if it were an insult.

Subject:      song or poem?

I think maybe part of the confusion between Jordan and Aldon may hinge on
the use of the word "poem".  Jordan, it seemed to me, was saying that a set
of song lyrics do not equal a poem.  Aldon took that to mean Jordan was
asserting that song lyrics are not poetic, or not poetry.  Which of course
is a different animal altogether (well, not always, but often).  Lots of
things besides poems are poetic, some of the better song lyrics among them.
Now stop fighting, you boys.  Oh yeah, you already did.

This brings up an interesting point. Some of my friends have remarked
that the term "experimental" can not apply in the arts, or at least not
as a direct analogy to scientific experiment. In science, an experiment
is designed to test a hypothesis: can the same be said for experimental
art?

I tend to disagree with them, and at least in terms of my own
viewpoints, I'd say that the hypothesis that experimental writing sets
out to test is "that a piece of writing written in such-and-such a way
will be interesting to read". This may seem fairly vague: could any of
the other writers here suggest any hypotheses that their experiments
have tested?

Of course, an experiment can either verify or falsify such a hypothesis,
and my friends (coming from their own tastes etc) would suggest that
much experimental writing falsifies the above hypothesis. This comes
back to the point that others have made here about experimental writers
not being critical of one another's work. If this _is_ the case, can
such work be said to be experimental?


        Yours &c,

        Tom Beard.

Subject:      Re: What experimental poets do to the mainstream

I think Keith's point is: If you choose sides, there will be war. He
seems to me to be admonishing people to deal with the poetry itself,
and I agree. He continually says "the so-called 'mainstream'" and
"the so-called 'experimental'". The poetry itself, or the poets them-
selves... Consider the success of New Directions. At what point do
the writers JL publishes cease to be members of one group and join the
other? Never, of course. But ever since they went into the black, ever
since W.W. Norton began distributing them, they have enjoyed a wider
circulation. Now they have Susan Howe. Does that mean that she is now
a "mainstream" poet? I'm baffled, because Susan's most recent book would
quickly be classified as "experimental" by those who use such words.

I'm sure it all goes back to the anthology wars. Or perhaps it goes
back to the beginning of the worship of Dionysus in Delphi...

To me, a poem is good if I like it. Still, I must admit, there are
back-scratch groups out there. Oddly, if I don't like most of what I
see from a group, I am not inclined to read further, and vice-versa.
But really, so few poets are really known that there can't really be
said to be a mainstream. Just a lot of watering holes.

About "chest-thumping": Listen, I am proud of my work. Nobody pays me
for it. What is left for me to do but beat upon my own frail chest and
declare, "Like me or don't, but I'm damn good!" And it could be delusion
but what are you going to do? Spank me?

Subject:      Re: How To Not Read

I am happy to confirm the suggestion so tactfully advanced by Joe Amato in
a recent post, namely that I have been educated by the consequences of my
review review.  I feel especially indebted to Keith Tuma, whose knowledge
of the British scene gives other Americans a standard to aspire to, and to
the many participants in that scene (Chris Cheek, Peter Larkin, Ken
Edwards, and others) who troubled themselves to respond to my posting with
concrete information otherwise difficult to obtain here in the States.

To Ira Lightman, whose passionate dissenting reading of my piece I
admired--not least for the tremendous commitment to intellectual fair play
that so obviously animated it--I reserve the special form of gratitude
which takes the form of continuing a discussion across differences, not
without the hope that these might be clarified and/or tentatively resolved.

A word about the transposition of the terms of debate (what the
Althusserians used to call "the problematic") across national boundaries
may be in order here, particularly in light of Lightman's opening clause,
"as a British poet...."  It would be disingenuous to read too much into
this particular filling out of the "speaking as an X" form, which at the
outset simply means to mark the speaker's positionality and to lay the
groundwork for some of the claims that will follow.  But since many of
those claims do crucially involve national identity, and do so in such a
way as to equate that identity with privileged knowledge, I think it bears
some elaboration.

What I recognized in reading Robert Potts's review of _Conductors of Chaos_
was a phenomenon characteristic of the relation between the dominant and
the dominated in the field of poetic practice.  Compared to that, the fact
of its appearing in a specific journal (the TLS) placed within a given
national culture (England) struck me as secondary.  Even after taking into
account Maxine Chernoff's and Keith Tuma's important qualifications as to
the different fate avant-garde anthologies have met when facing the U.S.
literary establishment, I stand by the claim.

The failure on the part of Robert Potts to be attentive to the
specificities of the book under review, his indifference at the level of
fact and his aggression at the level of motivation, were what prompted my
response.  As an American reader of poetry--i.e. one whose map of world
poetry is inevitably subjected at a minimum to the complacencies, in the
worst case to the structural arrogance of that position--I think the
failure of Potts to communicate anything like an adequate relation to the
anthology disturbed me precisely because I (and not only I) need the
information.

By the way, Ira, the phrase "xenophobic" was meant to indicate how deeply
structured Potts review seemed to be by the fear of difference.  Having
read a little in the literature surrounding the Movement, I am not unaware
that the problem of "foreigness" in 20th-century English poetry bears
directly on the problem of American poetry and extends to the problem of an
avant-garde project that was historically constituted as international (or
as Raymond Williams prefers to say, "para-national") and which has proven
belligerent to (and not surprisingly is therefore feared by) provincial
nationalisms.  If I have not been misled in my reading around the Arts
Council's response to Mottram's editorship of the _Poetry Review_, this
problem has been reformulated again and again by the dominant agents and
institutions in English literary life, but the variations seem less
important than the anti-modernist refrain.

I am one of those who consider the historical achievements of the
avant-garde project to have normative force in at least three areas
pertinent to us today.  First, in the defense of the autonomy of
intellectual (including poetic) practice against all attempts to impose
external criteria of evaluation.  Second, in the refusal to permit national
identity to act as the horizon of intellectual (including poetic) practice.
And third, in the commitment to negate capitalism's negation of human
(including intellectual, including poetic) potential.  While the
avant-garde project cannot be said to have corresponded exlusively to such
aims (Marinetti?! Pound?!), what is valuable about it in my view are these
dimensions of autonomy, anti-nationalism, and anti-capitalism.

From such a standpoint, the fact that both Donald Davie and I had fathers
who fit the category "shopkeeper" is of less concern (though the typicality
amongst Movement poets of a trajectory from working-class families to
Oxford and Cambridge to positions of academic anti-intellectualism does
interest me) than the fact that we are once again talking of Davie when
thirty-odd less known, less recognized, but by no means certainly less
valuable writers have work before us.

There is more, of course, to say.  But then everyone is saying it....

about three years ago i saw a great short film, if i'm remembering right it
was entitled "primi too taa" by ed ackerman.  the film was based on some of
kurt schwitters's sound poetry.  i saw it on the big omnimax (r) screen in
chicago, reclined way back watching ten foot high letters dance around
while a voice behind us grunted and moaned, reading the type.  absolutely
incredible.

does anyone know if and where i might find this on vhs?  and if i got the
title and director right?

thanks,

Dear Steve: I am not interested in decrying those people you listed after
Bob Dylan. It is just that I have never heard of them. And how would I? I
dont watch teenagers' TV shows, or read their magazines, or listen to
commercial radio stations. And I dont have conversations with teenagers
about music. So I have not heard of these people; but whenever I have been
somewhere where I cannot get my ear away from someone's radio and they are
playing commercial radio, I have not heard anything that seemed like good
poetry to me. Having not heard of Kurt Cobain before he shot himself, and
having been told that he was a big deal, I listened to a few cuts on a
video channel on TV. I didnt hear anything that resembled either poetry
(say, Paul Blackburn) or music (say Dollar Brand).

>Nick Cave, Oasis, etc.?

No one dismissed Oasis "out of hand": I, a working session
musician who plays on pop albums (populist that!), gave specific
musical (not lyrical) reasons for disliking Oasis. It isn't a matter
of pop music being inferior to classical music, it's a matter of
Oasis in particular being a 90's Brit Alterna-Twee xerox of the Beatles--
full of vacant Sgt. Pepper mannerisms and chart-competent song structure
and, in my opinion, very little else.

However, since you mention it, let's talk about the lyrics: Oasis has
less lyrical content than virtually any other band I've heard in
years. Simply put, I feel their lyrics lack intelligent content,
originality in tone, and prosodic ingenuity in form. Which makes
them mediocre by any standard I choose to employ--pop or otherwise.

However, I disagree with the gentlemen who dismissed Kurt Cobain's
lyrics. His tone--self-mocking, hypersensitive, numb--is emotionally
complex, his lyrics reveal quirky reading habits (_Perfume_,
by Patrick Susskind, in which we find the misanthropic, odorless
murderer with whom Cobain was said to identify) and powers
of invention, and the prosody, which is important to me,
stays consistently witty and bleak ("a mosquito: my libido,"
in C's most famous song).

However, there is another issue here, which has nothing to do
with genre, and that is *overexposure*. I could die tomorrow without
ever hearing another news bit about Michael Jackson, and that isn't
because he sucks as a musician. It is because I've heard enough Michael
Jackson songs to last a lifetime, because his song form is usually
eighties-rigid and that doesn't interest me, because I'm so familiar with
his style that it can't teach me anything else, and because the guy
is hopelessly *overexposed*. The issue isn't snobbery, it is my thirst
for new work by equally deserving artists.

I can hear the cantatas and quartets of Hans Werner Henze hundreds of
times and still hear new levels in his work; he isn't overexposed;
and I don't completely understand his style. That is why I listen
to Henze and avoid Michael Jackson. If the reader infers snobbery simply
because I've *mentioned* a classical composer, then the active snobbery
(read: dismissiveness) is on the part of said reader and has nothing
to do with my comparison.

Even so, if someone here says, "Cobain; *yawn*; do we really have
to discuss him *again*?" I for one will probably read said statement
as a complaint about over-exposure. I won't presume it to be a
snobbish condemnation simply because it is against a pop musician
and appears in a poetics list.

(And yeah, Nick Cave can write great lyrics. But I notice that no one
is discussing his novel, _King Ink_!)

To those of us who shuttle between the worlds of classical and popular
music, academic writing and comic book scripting, poetry and industrial
penny dreadfuls, rhetoric that condemns eclecticism as snobbery is as
old as the high/low culture dichotomy it tries to assault. Boolean
logic is limiting, whether it is used to denouce a genre of music,
or to denounce en masse the critics of music in that genre. By all
means, ask for respect where respect is due. But don't simplify
the views of others in the name of respecting complexity.

I could rail at critics for not respecting the visual poetry
in Michael Soavi's _Cemetery Man_ (or _Morte Dellamorte_).
But what good would that do, and what would it add to anyone
else's experience of seeing the film? I'd rather say--to put it
simply--: "_Cemetery Man_ is brilliant and funny, and is infused
with a sexuality that manages to be violent, gory and passionate
without being misogynistic." (And if anyone is interested, I'll
go into greater detail.)

In other words: don't get sidetracked by categories. Just
quote the lyrics you like and show us why you like them.


All the best,

Rob Hardin

Hi, it's Kevin Killian.  Ronald Johnson's reading here in San Francisco was
cancelled due to illness.  En route to San Francisco from Kansas, RJ fell
ill, but they hope to reschedule the reading for the Spring.

OK, one reading I did go to on Wednesday was presented by the Poetry Center
at SF State.  I was so curious to see--for the first time--the Pulitzer
Prize winner, Jorie Graham.  To those of you on this list who are familiar
with Graham, why didn't anyone tell me!  I stuck my head in the door and
saw her, and then bought her book, and she looks like the picture on the
jacket, except incomparably more alive, glamorous, exotic!  In the photo
she looks like Gloria Steinem but in person, as one former student
whispered to me, she *is* "the white Diana Ross."

(The decadent Diana Ross of the "Muscles" period, tho I don't expect all of
you, and certainly not you, George Bowering, to take my allusion.)

I couldn't stay to hear "Jorie" read (tho' I did get her autograph), but
others on this list were there and can fill you in.

Bravo Rob!!!  I went to see this great movie on the urging of Juliana Spahr
and Charles Weigl.  After having gone to endless horror films the past 10
years I tend to sneer at comic horror films as being too self-conscious and
not--I don't know what to say, emotionally involving isn't what I mean
exactly--psychically engaging is more it.  Anyway, Cemetery Man, for me,
broke through that and was hilarious and "deep" at the same time.  As I was
telling my class the other day, you can make *anything* work if you go at
it the right way.  I was particularly impressed with its use of clich=E9s,
which were blatantly displayed as clich=E9s, but still somehow managed to be
moving.

And yes, visually, it was a joy.

Though I know one person at least who thought CM was a piece of fluff--I
immediately lost all respect for him.

The discussion of the avant-garde and its fleas ariseth one more time,
regular as rain, and I agree with Peter Landers that it's good to read
it here where there are so many intelligent points of view. Yes, the
avant-garde (as a tradition) uses the "mainstream" (which is neither
main nor a stream) as a convenient foil. The TLS piece seemed to have
other things in mind and falls into a long line of works that wishes it
could repress the new (whereas the new wishes it could "liberate" the
repressed).

At the most recent summit of the G7 nations in Lisbon, the
entertainment for the first night's formal banquet was the
oft-mentioned Bob Dylan. Hopefully, he sang "masters of war," but the
way he so often mumbles his performances who can say what might have
been heard? I think that bank in Montreal is more on target than we
would wish to admit. Like many here, I do take it as all but
self-evident that his skills as a lyricist have had a far greater
impact on us all than any number of talented (but less talented)
successors. Tho I had hopes for awhile for the high formalism of Public

Mark:

Briefly, as I've a mountain of papers to grade.  I know there's much down below
your remarks, and I've scanned it and perhaps will respond to some of it
tomorrow.

Re my "generalizations" about "experimental" poets.  There's a passage in a
letter I read once from Basil Bunting to Zukofsky.  In it, Bunting says to LZ
that it would be a good idea if he set about re-writing poems the two of them
agreed were bad, in order to show how he (LZ) might improve the project
seemingly underway in the bad poem and mangled.  I've always liked that idea,
though I realize it's tedious work (as did LZ, surely).  When I say that,
often, the so-called avant-garde (and to get into my reasons for that phrase
is more than I can handle tonight; it would involve a tour through Paul Mann's
_The Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde) doesn't engage the "mainstream" I mean
that there's very little reading of "mainstream" poets in the prose of
a-g poets. There is a lot of talk about things like "official verse culture,"
Charles' phrase, and often it is useful and always it is provocative and
sometimes it is entertaining.  There is no question that "experimentalists"
don't get the goodies to the extent that others do:  remember, I work in a
university, I know something about these things.  Thus it seems to me important
to try, again and again as things change, to paint the scene(s) in broad
strokes.  Polemic can be useful at the right time and the right place. It also
gathers an inertia and solidity that obstructs and obfuscates.  But that's not
my point.  My complaint about a-g prose (for which you now chastise me as
ceding too much ground) is that it too rarely moves through what is taken to
be a mainstream making fine distinctions and careful critique.  You ask me
to show you examples of the sort of "generalizations" you think I'm
attributing to the avant-garde.  But it's mostly an absence I'm talking about,
so I'll ask you to show me examples of a-g poets reading and criticizing (or
praising) particular "mainstream" poets.  Where are the readings of Frank
Bidart, a poet I admire, or Dave Smith, a poet I don't.  (Names selected
randomly from the shelf beside me).  Wouldn't it be more effective to engage
those poets in this way rather than always (or usually) pursuing the broader
maps--of the socio-economics of official verse culture, of the persistence of
a naive cult of authenticity, whatever--in terms either richly provocative or
powerfully analytical  or merely in weak echoes that assume everything is
settled?  I surely think so.  I'm talking about tactics.  Now, there are of
course exceptions.  My friend Marjorie P, for instance, often grounds her
celebration of experimental practices and her historical narratives
legitimating them in exactly the way I am suggesting, though, to my dismay,
Marjorie likes to pick on poor Phil Levine (and a few others)--easy targets.
Not much talk in her work about, say, Robert Hass.  Jed Rasula's recent book
is exemplary here as well, though I have problems with its tone in places (as
well as with some of its Baudrillardian moments). So, you see, I don't think
I'm ceding anything--or, rather, this tactic cedes little.  Even intelligent
critical advocates of other poetries--Charles Altieri, Robert von Hallberg,
John Koethe, Allen Grossman, others--are rarely engaged in a-g prose.  An
opportunity--to respond to Koethe's argument about "conventions" for instance--
is being bypassed.  Look at what Walter Benn Michaels said recently (in a
footnote inModernism/Modernity) about Marjorie P and Charles B.  A cheap shot
if ever there was one.  It would be hard to take these if we were persuasive;
clearly we're not.  One way we're not, it seems to me, is in sustaining
blunt binaries between "mainstream" and "avant-garde" practices (plural you
note).  But this takes me back to the avant-garde question I'm trying to avoid.

Now as for "chest-thumping" and rhetoric and such.  You can't imagine how
horrified I am to see that phrase and my name in subject headings!  You're
right that your rhetoric bothered me, and I take your new one and your words
concerning your old one as a friendly gesture:  thanks.  As for mine, I can
only say that I used the phrase--perhaps too casually, spontaneously--as a way
of expressing some solidarity with Ira, who had used the same or a related
phrase.  It was thus an echo, and one that meant to demonstrate that, though
I had contested some of Ira's points in his post about Potts, Davie, _C of C_
and etc., I also thought I understood where he was coming from in other ways.
You read the term as my accusing a-g prose writers of being "macho."  That
was not my intention in using the word, though I understand how you read it
the way you did and indeed it is true that I think the a-g sometimes gets
caught up in a miltaristic rhetoric (there's of course a long tradition). I
don't think we need any more generals waving the banners of emerging
or existing "movements."  Indeed, I think such rhetoric is, as I've said,
counter-productive in many ways.

Well this is longer than I'd hoped it would be.  I hope it explains things--
there are limits to this medium--and addresses the concerns of your post,
which I'm trying now to remember!

Subject:      all over the map

(The last few days, for some reason, I've been rising earlier than
usual. Hence a couple of posts.)

Teenagers? If you've got them you know they may actually have serious
interests.

Natalie Merchant doesn't appeal to them, however -- sorry, George.

Kurt Cobain was an incredible writer of the American pop song, really
exceptional. Every song has a hook at the melodic, rhythmic and verbal
whole. You have my personal guarantee, moreover, that you'll be hearing
his songs on elevators within a decade... no, within five years.
Remember that I said it. (And it is not a slam on KC)

Pop music = music that is not classical? Huh? Verdi the most popular
composer in the 19th century full stop. It really is possible to think
in a way that is not simply manipulation of the given terms with the
added spice of "where I stand" with respect to them (i.e. "I" "prefer"
"experimental" "poetry")

By all accounts, Robert Johnson loved to sing show tunes, could pick up
anything he heard almost instantly and entertained everybody with a
wide range of singing and playing. He's recorded doing blues only --
that's all he was allowed to represent as his range. (Tho listen to his
"Red Hots" [I prob. have the name of that tune wrong] for an indication
outside the box)

On experimental poetry vs. mainstream: these are names not descriptors.
Why do people volunteer to be lumped together, I always wonder?

Putting the other guy down is an exact equivalent to praising oneself.
Simply writing this on the wall above one's monitor will go a long way
to inducing a useful silence.

(There was, btw, a long thread on "experiment" in poetry vs. science on
this listserv as much as 2-3 years ago.)

Capitalism as denying human potential. Gee, that's not what Marx
thought. But it does feel good to say it. Esp. when there's no cost
attached.

I often think about a man named, I believe, David Brodsky, a jew I'm
sure (alas) who spent with the Mandelstams the last evening before
Osip's final arrest. Brodsky was a literary guy of some kind, a
translator I believe. He seemed reluctant to leave. In retrospect, his
job was to be there to make sure the object of attention would not skip
out.

I'm sure he had a melancholy kind of compromised mind, committed to
literature and with an overarching sense that "the revolution" simply
must have a true hold on the future, given all the good energy it
encapsulated, the social force it held. There were many like him I
think, certain of generalizations, able to overlook any particular,
with a moral equation handy when necessary to cover threadbare
quotidian betrayals of common sense and pals. Oh well.

Changing subjects: "Experimental" poetry and art are "mainstream" in
our culture -- this would seem to be obvious on the face of it,
certainly to anyone observing the career of say John Cage to pick only
one example. Funded, published, recorded, etc. and all by institutions
in the main stream of our culture and economy.

I read the other day that Madonna "considers herself an avantgarde
performance artist."

How likely would it be that she would "consider herself" a Jew in
Germany in 1938? A Panther in Chicago in 1968? Isn't it obvious to you
that a term like "experimental" is an honorific? Self-praise?

What about some NEW ideas. Maybe if we advertised this listserv outside
the academy?

Most of the s-c mainstream magazines started the same way.  I've been engaged
on my own path in writing for a few decades now & have also succeeded pretty
well in keeping my distance from the "institutional support" it seems the
real a-g experimenters crave.  What camp does that put me in?  Well, unlike
Madonna (maybe more like Mary Magdalen?) I don't care whether or not people
consider me an "experimental artist".  Bad taste, I know, to talk about
oneself.  Better to merge with the "normative" embattled proto-post-plus-
nec-ultra-futurists... - Henry Gould

Hypothesis: what corporations think of doing with art doesn't matter in
the slightest.  For one thing, corporations don't think.  Have fun down at
the bank lobby, Bob.

In a recent book called /'Scuse Me While I Kiss This Guy,/ compiled by
Gavin Harris (is that right?) of /Details/ magazine, it's revealed that
someone went around thinking "a mosquito: my libido" was "I'm a scarecrow
and a Beatle." I kind of like that variant reading.

Recommend this book for a silly jumpstart into disjunctive thinking on
those mornings when your brain just won't turn over--

speaking of which, i'm kind of surprised that there hasn't been, in the year and
a half i've been on the list, much discussion of rap and hiphop culture as a
vanguard development, or at the very least, a cultural expression w/ something
of relevance to poetixlisters.  what do you all think of artists like tracie
morris and other poets who take much of their inspiration from hip hop culture?

Hello,
I happened to be in a mailing to which you had sent an email reg the
"Doshi-Hussain Gufa". My response to that mail is attached below. If you

whoever forwarded the original email to you. This is not meant to be a

It is indeed heartening to see the citizens of India rise for freedom of
expression which is probably the most sacred of all rights democracy can
or should guarantee. But the groups heading the expression of such opinion,
are they really fighting for the preservation of the freedom of speech and
expression? I cannot but doubt it.
        I can clearly remember two different occasions when the freedom of
expression was curtailed by the Govt. of India. First was the "The Satanic
Verses"  by Salman Rushdie and the second Martin Scorsese's film called "The
Last Temptation of Christ". Both of these expressions by an artist were
banned by the Indian Govt. There were no protests whatsoever from any
corners. I cannot but notice the one commonality between the two instances
I've quoted. They were concerned with a non-Hindu religion. And in the
current instance whats the religion involved? Hinduism! Ah! What a coincidence!
        If you folks are really for freedom of expression start where all
this started. Make "The Satanic Verses" and Martin Scorsese's film available
to the Indian public before supporting M.F. Hussain's blasphemy of Hindu
Gods. A little adherence to chronology never hurt anyone!

NCADP CASE UPDATE & ACTION ALERT

TO:  CONCERNED ACTIVISTS
FR:  STEVE HAWKINS, DIRECTOR
RE:  AZI KAMBULE, S. AFRICAN YOUNGSTER FACING DEATH ROW IN MISSISSIPPI

PLEASE FORWARD TO ASSOCIATES & MEDIA CONTACTS
-----------------------------------------------------

        Efforts to save Azikiwe Kambule, a 10th-grader facing death row
in Mississippi as an accomplice to a murder he did not participate in,
have produced an important early victory!
        Fundraising activities have at last collected enough money for
Azi's family to retain a private attorney, a critical need against
Mississippi's well-funded prosecutors.  The arrival of new counsel means
Azi's case won't go to trial until January at the earliest.
        Meanwhile, the campaign to save Azi continues to gain momentum.
Students in Pretoria, where Azi's case is headline news, are holding a
bake sale to help in fundraising efforts.  Students at Oberlin College
are circulating petitions on Azi's behalf.  Columbia University students
are hosting a poetry benefit.  Over 500 letters, including appeals from
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other human rights leaders, have poured into
the office of Madison County District Attorney John Kitchens, demanding
that he drop his effort to have Azi put to death.
        Dennis Brutus, a South African poet and former exile noted for
years of work to win the release of apartheid's political prisoners, has
convened the Azikiwe Kambule Committee for Justice to help coordinate
activities on this important case.

ACTION ALERT

        Thanks to all who have already written letters and/or contributed
to the defense fund.  The AKCJ is calling on concerned people to take the
following steps next:
        *Encourage religious leaders to take a stand.  Madison County
District Attorney John Kitchens needs to understand that the path he is
taking is not only anti-human rights but immoral.  By the end of the
holiday season, the Reverends Robert and Carolyn Abrams plan to collect
at least 2000 letters from religious leaders of all faiths who oppose the
death penalty for children.  Address the letters as follows (model
letters are available from the NCADP's national office)
                Mr. John Kitchens
                Madison County District Attorney
                c/o Revs. Robert and Carolyn Abrams
                216 North Azalia Drive
                Wiggins, MS 39577

        *Arrange for Dennis Brutus to speak in your area.  The NCADP and
AKCJ are setting up a speaking tour for Mr. Brutus to raise public
awareness of the case.  Interested parties should contact the NCADP for
more information.
        *Pass around the "Stop Killing Kids" petition currently being
circulated by the AKCJ and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty and mail them to the NCADP by January 2, 1997.  Petitions will be
hand-delivered to Mississippi officials early in the new year.  Original
copies of the petitions are available from the NCADP's national office;
please e-mail us at ncadp1@nicom.com to receive a copy.  Alternatively,
activists can lay out and run off petitions using the attached text and
instructions.

PETITION

TEXT

Title:  "Mississippi Must Respect the Human Rights of _All_ Children"

Body:   Whereas several major international human rights treaties
ratified by the US -- including the International Convention on Civil and
Political Rights -- prohibit seeking the death penalty for crimes
individuals commit before the age of 18.

        Whereas the UN Convention on Rights of the Child, which the US
has signed, clearly states:  "Neither capital punishment nor life without
possibility of release shall be imposed for crimes committed by persons
below eighteen years of age."

        Whereas the US is the only Western country, and one of only five
nations in the world, still executing children.

        Whereas the State of Mississippi has a vested interest in moving
beyond its reputation for allowing its residents' human rights to be
trampled.

        Be it resolved that we the undersigned urge Mississippi Governor
Kirk Fordice, Attorney General Mike Moore and Madison County District
Attorney John Kitchens to respect international human rights law, and
cease their efforts to put Azikiwe Kambule, or any other child, on death
row or behind bars for the rest of their natural lives!

-------------------
INSTRUCTIONS:
        Have petitioners provide their signature and printed name, and if
willing, their address, phone number and e-mail as well.  Please attempt
to collect 250 signatures (1000 for students on large campuses).  Return
the petitions to the NCADP by January 2, 1997.

Subject:      Re: How To Not Read

Er hi, I'll just put my head above the parapet
again. Thanks, Steve, for seeing my good intentions;
I was only teasing you by nitpicking your style
because I thought you were hard on Mr Potts
who writes quite succinctly and readably; I
don't think that makes him right, I do think
he articulates some useful things to know
people are thinking; I don't think the TLS is
central command HQ; although it's read widely
because still on automatic subscription to
world libraries, I don't myself think it
influences people to buy or not buy books as
much as Poetry Review does - and as Peter
Larkin said, it reviews C of C better; and I also
think readers are used to its crankiness and its
wrongness (it is owned by Rupert Murdoch,
after all) and wouldn't go jump in a lake
if it told them to.
        As I hoped, I've been thoroughly
educated on how different the US is, and I
can much better see it all now. I tentatively
still quibble with the financial tack, but
only because no-one in Britain except Seamus
Heaney gets much money; patronage and more
review space yes, but this is leading to
cynicism towards hype, like everyone reviewing
and interviewing the same films and stars,
and actually something fresh comes well out
of that. Which is why C of C is actually
being bought, much more than A Various Art,
which would probably sell if re-issued in
a slightly expanded 2nd edition or some such.
People are bored with the blah blah mainstream.
It's also why reviewers are being more polite,
more articles on Heaney won't sell their
mags. Is there no potential of this
stateside?
        I guess I'm defending: writing style
as something one can work on in essays and
personal deportment style and gig style as
something one can work on in publicising
difficult poetry. Thus, listening
to what feedback we can get,
and knowing how to take it usefully.

But, Steve, I don't accept your defence:

"the phrase 'xenophobic' was meant to indicate
how deeply structured Potts review seemed to
be by the fear of difference"

Because almost none of the words and terms
you're using are precise enough.

1) Xenophobic means xenophobic, and a thesaurus will
yield "touchy", "reactionary" and "rattled",
so that one can still wound by calling someone
who is dangerously xenophobic "xenophobic".

2) "Deeply structured" seems to presume a lot
as does

3) "fear of difference", especially since
the latter can sound like you mean, Potts won't
buy his groceries from someone not British (I'll
leave your analysis of the deep structure of my
idiomatic expression "as a British poet" which
simply meant "as someone living in the country
and the idiom you have misread, so I forgive you")
or vote for his usual party if the candidate's
sexuality or race or gender isn't his own, or
goes out in gangs and physically hurts people.
I just think Potts is, and far too many of us
are, tuned into his own music and his own work
and is being too quickly nasty as a literary
reviewer. He doesn't hear it because it's not
the same. That's less fear of difference than
amour propre, which is highly highly highly
common.
        But all I wanted to do was make a stand
for a kind of essay style I like, and to see
if my post could get people to tell me about the
US more.

Best

Ira

P.S. Mark Wallace, I cannot even backchannel you
over your post. I know you've read my essay on
British poetry and magazines and Davie, in
Texture, because you've publically said so on
the list. The charge of wanting censorship has
actually made me really upset, as I consider
you a friend, an ally, and an interesting
head of steam (I mean that as an idiomatic
compliment with the exact meant resonance that
passion is great but must know itself to
keep its passion and evolve at the same time).
I'm considered by some in England as so
pro-Language Writing that I'm just being trendy
and outrageous and permissive for their own
sake. I'm published by Leave Books, and edit
a magazine promoting Juliana Spahr, Elizabeth
Burns, Lisa Samuels and some British younger
women whom I am the only British editor to seek,
encourage and publish. You really don't know
what you're talking about here, and have leapt
to a whopping conclusion. Cris and everyone
are teasing you harshly, and I say be sensitive,
we're not all bashing you. But your impetuousness
loses you this friend, barring an apology.

"... my focus is on the oddly neglected fact that New Criticism was in
effect a public relations firm that pioneered and then successfully
promulgated a certain brand of poetry" (_the american poetry wax museum_,
69)

now jed doesn't situate such effects within the history of public relations
per se, but instead correlates his observations about new criticism with
what he calls the "the age of sociology" (the stauber/rampton book gives a
brief overview of the history of pr, focusing on the field's founding
fathers, ivy lee and edward bernays)...

anyway, the stauber/rampton book *does* in fact provide an excellent (and
as i say, scary) account of the far-reaching effects of contemporary pr
maneuvering...

and i was thinking last night, while discussing the book in class, about
this discussion of experimental (term used advisedly, and i use it to
denote formal qualities) vs. mainstream (term used advisedly, and i use it
to denote economic realities), and wondering whether we haven't, all of us,
fallen somewhat into the trap of failing to distinguish twixt the pr
component of poetics, rather strictly speaking, and the various other
practices that constitute the writing and study of poetry?...

i mean, to use the term pr a bit less figuratively than does jed (who
writes "in effect"), there are very real public relations operations no
doubt being waged by very real firms ("literary" and otherwise) and
individuals ("literary" and otherwise), and it is in the best interests of
such firms and individuals to promote various aesthetics for various
reasons (no, not necessarily poetry per se, but at the very least poetries
that are probably understood as a subset of larger sociocultural
practices)... and if there is A mainstream aesthetic, or general set of
aesthetic practices that have gone mainstream, it is likely that this is
the result of (no, i wouldn't use a highly-charged term like 'conspiracy')
an encompassing, super-efficient pr effort, one that depends upon, say,
something like what stauber/rampton detail as a key pr strategy:  after
ronald duchin (who attended the us army war college in carlisle, pa, and
went on after his stints working for the secretary of the defense and the
vfw to become vice-president of mongoven, biscoe and duchin---a leading pr
"spy" firm) dividing activists into four categories:  radicals, idealists,
opportunists and realists...

for duchin, it's the realists (i.e., pragmatists) who are most vulnerable
to pr (you can appeal to their desire to work within the system)... then
the opportunists (you can appeal to their base motives)... hence the
radicals (those who are motivated by social justice and systemic change)
are marginalized by educating the key group, the idealists---which latter
are vulnerable simply b/c they can be persuaded ('educated') to accept a
corporate compromise position that apparently reduces harm (to
individuals)... but it's the so-called radicals, clearly, who are most
resistant to pr logic...

now we don't need to accept duchin's categories as such (or, for that
matter, my alignment of pr-activist strategy with poetics issues), but if
this DOES indeed represent a primary way by which pr firms regularly
exploit citizenry (i.e., US) to corporate ends, we might consider the
extent to which each of us, as readers, is vulnerable to contemporary
pr-style logics... i won't work out the correspondences in detail (and
besides, i may be verging here on sheer idiocy)... but mself, i find that
i'm too pragmatic (probably my past incarnation as an engineer should have
told me this), and mebbe a bit idealistic... i'd like to think i can be
more radical than i am, or have been, which would mean working harder to
accept writing that actively confronts my inertia, my tendency toward
status quo, to be willing to entertain more fully writing that threatens to
dismantle the established system in order to bring about a more diverse, if
not representative, aesthetic reality...

now i can't say to what extent one's personal (or public) commitment to a
given poetry compromises one's willingness to bring about social justice
(i'm talking in aesthetic terms here, and i trust some of you will note the
resonance with my earlier attempt to discuss good/Good bad/Bad)... that is,
i see no reason why, in theory, a poet who has garnered mainstream acclaim
can't at the same time argue for a more radical rethinking/reworking of
publishing possibilities (which i would say does not constitute yet more
pr---simply b/c it's not a matter of re-propagandizing, but of activating
for actual fair play)... at the same time, i can imagine, practially
speaking, why there may be less real motivation to do so, once one is
resting sufficiently on one's publishing laurels... same goes, in many
ways, for scholars (lentricchia's recent 'conversion' a case in point)...

but it does seem to me, in any case, that to bring about a multiplicity of
perspectives in any discussion of poetry/poetics (and it's the binary of
experimental/mainstream i'm after, finally) we ought at least to recognize
the ways in which our apparently individualized perceptions of poetry and
poetics have been shaped (literally!) by public relations efforts that
attempt to exploit our habitual orientations, aesthetic and otherwise (and
whence such orientations is another matter)... so if we talk about our
commitment, as writers and readers, to various poetries---poetries which
are of course subject to, say, political as well as aesthetic scrutiny---we
might do well, too, to talk about how we see such commitments as speaking
to (our) other, less literary, less scholarly public agenda... perhaps,
say, the bulk of our contributions to this forum?... like, aside from
establishing network community, communicating
publication/distribution/readings information, permitting for dialogue
across continents, chat, supporting our job searches (mea culpa), and even
incl. (yes) the *noise* i so value around here---and is (or isn't) this
enough?---what more can this forum do to recuperate those voices that have
been lost in the mainstreams?... are we doing enough to promote diversity,
or is there another way to conduct ourselves (shorter, more pointed
posts?!) that might make room for more voices?... and one hobbyhorse:  can
we discuss the material realities of pr in even more material detail, can
anybody out there make legible whether and to what extent there are pr
agencies 'running' tls, dictating review policy? (in the absence of which
discussion perhaps we *are* only dealing with a secondary effect, and don't
quite grasp the extent of the problem(s), which is clearly the case with
the multinationals)... and can we discuss this w/o provoking one another
into intellectual warfare over whose commitment to the margins (if margins
they be only *as a result of* poetry-related pr) is the more righteous?...

anyway, apologies for going on some... i know this is messy, but i'm just
thinking out loud...

best,

As a ps, I'll just paste in a paragraph
from a backchannel note; if it seems
ad hominem, it's just because I need to
offer an alternative psychoanalysis of
deep structure. Is language structured
like "the" unconscious (Lacan), or is
it more like a society or even a family,
thinking of Derrida's Glas. Anyway, here's
the homily:



With wanting a response, surely most people know

you put out a feeler and it never comes back

as you'd predict and that's community? Okay,

you can call that capitalism but it's also

true of friendship, or just intimacy that

means two people share an experience that

helps them both. I can't call that friendship

moment capitalist to fit a theory of the

horrors of having to sell yourself or thing.

I'm inclined to call the totalising rejection,

of a whole type of relations, a pseudo

"anti-capitalism"; and say it masks a passion

(to want intimacy) so rich that it sure makes the

poetry sing yeah but the person vulnerable, likely

to control and over-react; and that's tragic

human when it could have been gorgeous human.

Dear Ira,
I'm very aware of the positive effect you are having on the poetic
environment we are part of, which is why I have to admit to feeling
distressed about your recent posts. In applying the word "censorship" to your
recent position I was probably overstating my case, and for that I apologize.
Frankly, I often overstate my case to this list on purpose, in an attempt to
draw attention to issues that seem to me of importance. In so doing, I do
attract some negative attention but manage also to encourage lively debate. I
do however want to suggest that your initial post in response to Steve Evans
does in fact suggest that his piece should not be further circulated and is
not worthy of broader consideration. Here's what you said:

> I don't agree at all with Mark Wallace
that Steve Evans should consider more widely
>circulating this review; it just about works
in the context of this group, where, much to
>my own personal regret, we experimentalists
get more of our chests as outbursts, especially
>versus the mainstream, than we do engage in real debate.

In failing even to suggest that Steve's piece, perhaps rewritten for context,
could have any relevance to the TLS, you still seem to me to be tacitly
aiding those who think that the best response to avant-garde work is silence,
dismissal, and ridicule. I must continue to insist that you rethink your
position on these issues while at the same time remaining sorry that my
tone-- purposefully gruff in order to make things happen --may have in this
case personally offended you.

Despite the fact that I probably would disagree in the end with Joe Amato
about minds being "literally shaped" etc., and despite the fact that
what he says here goes against most of the noise I've been making on these
subjects, the issues he raises here are so important & pertinent to
whatever people think "poetics" means!

"experimental" refers to formalities - yes!
"mainstream" to economics - yes!

To talk about pr starts to get at historical realities, in a more direct
way what I was mumbling about before in terms of there being more ways to
"promote" specific poets & poetries than simply market capitalism. Here
categories like propaganda & entertainment & art start to get fleshed out.
And you might open up a new critical angle within poetry on the hall of
mirrors. (Though he rightly suggests we can't step outside the hall
ourselves.) - Henry Gould

Ah, George, at least when you're dismissive, you do it with that sly sense
of humor.  It doesn't require any contact with teenagers or "their" culture
(which is usually really segments of dominant culture targeted at teenagers)
to hear of these musicians, and I don't often listen to commercial radio
stations myself.  But I do keep my eyes and ears open wherever I am, have
listening sessions with my friends (who are in their 20's and 30's, for the
most part), etc. etc.

I might just add that it's intrinsic to Nirvana's poetics that their poetry
won't resemble Paul Blackburn's or their music Dollar Brand's, but there's
plenty of room in both fields for what their ideas of music and poetry are.
I think that should be a given, but I wonder sometimes...

If I remember rightly, your taste runs more toward jazz, does it not?  I
hear that was teenybopper music at some point too.  :-)

One knows. It is just that when you say Dollar Brand to each other, you are
signifying that you listened to him when that was still his name on

             Helmut Heissenb|ttel, German writer, died on September 19
                                aged 75. He was born on June 21, 1921.

            FOR almost 40 years Helmut Heissenb|ttel espoused an extreme
            literary modernism that by the end of his career had come to
seem
            rather old-fashioned. Literature, he believed, could have
only one real
            subject, and that was language itself. In a large body of
work which
            resisted classification into any of the familiar genres   he
himself
            preferred to talk of "texts" and "projects", rather than
"poetry" or
            "theory" or "prose"   Heissenb|ttel attempted to penetrate
language
            and lay bare its hidden workings, testing to the limit our
ability to
            grasp the world through words.

            Not surprisingly, perhaps, he was never a popular writer.
But he was
            esteemed by critics and fellow writers in Germany and
elsewhere, and
            for a time in the 1960s and 1970s the experimental
tendencies he
            embodied seemed an important part of literary life. His
works were
            translated into English and other languages (though they
were no
            easier to translate than to classify), and he was honoured
with some
            of the German-speaking world's most coveted literary awards.

            The son of a bailiff, Helmut Heissenb|ttel was born in
R|stringen near
            Wilhelmshaven. In the course of military service during the
Second
            World War he was severely wounded, losing his left arm in
1941, after
            which he took no further part in the fighting. From 1942 to
1955 he
            studied at the universities of Dresden, Leipzig and Hamburg,
reading
            first architecture, then German literature and art history.
On finishing
            his studies, he spent two years working in advertising in
Hamburg,
            before moving to Stuttgart to join the staff of South West
German
            Radio, where in 1959 he succeeded the novelist Alfred
Andersch as
            head of the "Radio-Essay" department, and where he remained
until his
            retirement in 1981.

            Heissenb|ttel began to write at the age of 15, but his first
published
            works date from the early 1950s. Collected in two volumes
            Kombinationen (1954) and Topographien (1956)   these early
pieces
            present a view of the world that is fragmented,
contradictory and
            incomplete, but still unmistakably lyrical in inspiration
and intent;
            this is writing that belongs to a recognisable poetic
tradition.

            From the 1960s onwards, however, in works such as those
collected
            into a series of numbered Textb|cher, Heissenb|ttel moved
much
            further away from what he saw as the arbitrary hierarchies
of
            conventional grammar and syn tax, and relied instead on
techniques
            such as collage, quotation and juxtaposition. These methods
were
            developed and elaborated to a daunting degree in the complex
multiple
            perspectives of D'Alembert's Ende (1970), an extended
fiction that
            was the nearest Heissenb|ttel came to writing a novel.

            But Heissenb|ttel's approach to language was always less
purely
            playful than that of some of his contemporaries and
associates, such
            as the Austrians Ernst Jandl and Friederike Mayrvcker. What
fascinated
            him about words was their role in human society, so that his
linguistic
            games and experiments, far from becoming an end in
themselves, are
            often turned to sharply satirical purpose.

            Heissenb|ttel was fortunate to be able to spend his working
life in a
            job that provided a focus and forum for his literary and
artistic
            interests: as editor in charge of the influential
"Radio-Essay"
            programme strand at South West German Radio, he commissioned
and
            collaborated on talks, readings and performances by many of
the most
            significant avant-garde figures of the day. He was also a
perceptive
            and original critic, not only of literature but of the
visual arts. The
            range of his contacts, and the depth of their affection for
him, was
            evident in the volume of tributes presented to him on his
seventieth
            birthday in 1991.

            Helmut Heissenb|ttel is survived by his wife Ida, whom he
married in
            1954, and by a son and three daughters.

Thanks for forwarding the Times obit, Tom. What it goes to show, in view
of recent threads here, is that Times or TLS, meme combat! The same
dismissive attitude towards any wriitng that is not sterilized &
sanitized mainstream salon-fahig. For Iain Sinclair's book the attack
has to be in the face, given that Iain is still alive & kicking as are
most of  the writers in his anthology. The Heissenbuttel obit can be
mnore gentile, given that heissenbuttel isn't around anymore. But the
background ideology both pieces come from is close to identical.
Basically the century's explorations are written off, there is a sense
that happily we are back where we started, safe in old England, where
Victoriana-Thatcherian values (culturally, Arnoldian-Eliotian
conservatism) have won the day. Vide a sentence like the one opening one
of the obit:

>             FOR almost 40 years Helmut Heissenb|ttel espoused an extrem=
e

        One may   be allowed to wonder, "to whom did it seem old-fashioned?"
The all-knowing Times obit-lit-crit who lays the century's attempts at
"making it new" to rest in one crisp sentence. It is the opening
sentence & sets the tone. We now know that HH was a nice old out-of-date

Subject:      Eclecticism:  Snap Crackle AND pop

I just want to go on record agreeing vociferously with Rob Hardin, who, with
his extensive musical back (and fore) ground, obviously knows what he's
talking about:

...agreeing that eclecticism is not snobbery and, therefore, we should stop
worrying about the categories and discuss the work on its own merit,
regardless of what part of the musical spectrum it comes from or who its
intended or actual audience is.

...agreeing that Oasis are derivative of 60's British pop and complete
morons to boot, making them and their music indefensible and uninteresting
on critical grounds (however I must add that they're derivative of a musical
style I'm personally not yet sick of hearing variations on, and I think
they're quite good at pastiching aspects of that style.  Why do I think
this?  Maybe a real musician could tell us...)

...agreeing with all that stuff about Nirvana too!

On another interface, I'd like to just clarify something that Tom Mandel
responded to:  I am aware that what's now called "classical" music
(particularly opera) once had a wide enough audience to merit the term
"popular".  However, when I used the term popular, I didn't mean popular, I
meant popular.  I mean the category popular music doesn't necessarily align
itself with what's popular in the sense that a lot of people like it.
Separated by a common language.

All this agreeableness is making me thirsty.

EAR INN UPDATE

Despite a vicious rainstorm that even cancelled baseball, the Ear Inn was
once again filled to capacity on Saturday October 19th.  Hordes of poets
braved the downpour and high winds to see Anselm Berrigan and Kim Lyons
read their work.

Anselm opened the reading with "I remember hearing Joe Brainard read his
poem I Remember at the Ear Inn..." and proceeded from there with a great
series of meditations about life in San Francisco.  Bernadette Mayer later
said that Anselm's Mount Shasta poem included a secret message about UFO
activity.

Kim Lyons complemented Anselm's reading with incredible meditations about
life in New York.  No UFOs, but some pigeons.  She closed her reading with
a new and truly epic poem called "Eon" which ranks in the top ten list of
great poems read at the Ear Inn.

The audience included, alphabetically: Tim Atkins,  Brenda Coultas, Tim
Davis,  Joe Elliot, Rob Fitterman, Liz Fodaski, Drew Gardner,  John
Godfrey,  Judith Goldman, Phil Good, Jackson Highfill, Mitch Highfill, Bill
Luoma, Anna Malmude, Greg Masters, Bernadette Mayer, Sophia Mayer, Douglas
Rothschild, Prageeta Sharma, Eleni Sikelianos, Lorna Smedman, Juliana
Spahr, Brian Stefans, and Lewis Warsh.

If your last name begins with B, I, K, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, X, or Z, please
come to the Ear Inn on Saturday October 26th at 2:30 pm  to see Deirdre
Kovac and Barbara Henning.  Deirdre is a BIG ALLIS associate editor and her
work has been kicking ass all over the country in magazines such as Denver
Quarterly, Object, Letterbox, and The Poetry Project Newsletter.  Barbara's
most recent book, LOVE MAKES THINKING DARK, was released by United Artists
last year.

The Ear Inn is at 326 Spring Street in New York City.  Come early, stay
late  it's the greatest show on earth.

The new South Africa has libraries and schools, but it is
tragically short on books.  One non-profit organization that has
begun to fill South Africa's need for books is the South African
International Book Drive.  This organization was founded in 1993
by Dr. Julius Wayne Dudley, a Professor of History at Salem State
College in Massachusetts, USA.

The South African International Book Drive has shipped more than
600,000 books to South Africa.  Over three hundred South African
schools and libraries are currently receiving books and
educational materials from the organization which hopes to ship
more than one million books to South Africa by the year 2000.
Books of all types and for all age groups are desperately needed
throughout the country.  Textbooks, educational toys, works of
literature, stationery, computer disks, writing instruments, as
well as library reference materials are all in short supply and
are desperately needed, Dr. Dudley reports.

How you can help

The South African International Book Drive welcomes donations of
any of the items listed above or funds to help pay for related
expenses.

I agree, Thomas Bell, "experimental" can only make sense as "trials",
"trying it on" "seeing what can be done if such and such a condition
were to be changed" and the histories of the arts are stories of
trials & errors then? Sides do get taken over this (as per the v
recent and continuing Evans,Wallace,Tuma, Lightman debate).

 The "psychic investments" involved  are maybe something you cd comment
on? How do us "marginalized" persons come to be that way? What is the
attraction? What does it mean to want Steve Evans to hold off from a
counter-attack on Potts who has it seems attacked Iain Sinclair and
his anthologised companions?  I can only wonder.

Good point. Maybe I am using the term "experiment" too literally or
narrowly, but my background is in science and I think that it may be
useful to consider the primary meaning (as used in the sciences) of a
term when applying it to other fields.

Still, your definition of an experiment as a "test or trial undertaken
to _discover_ something" may not be too far from mine. The question is,
do we have some idea of what it is we might discover? Do we have some
way of telling whether, once the experiment has been undertaken, whether
anything _has_ been discovered?

Maybe a better term for activities (literary or scientific) that hope to
discover something, without having a pre-conceived idea of what that
something might be, is "exploratory". This might link in well with your
emphasis on "discovery", though some might detect colonialist overtones
in both words. It sounds like something to be conducted in the open air
rather than in a laboratory.

Still, using the word "discovery" as the touchstone for "experimental"
writing might be unfair to other modes of writing. For example, many
poets who work in the lyric mode would argue that a poem (for them) is a
process of discovery, and yet few would apply the term "experimental" to
such poems. I've come to dislike one traditional definition of the lyric
mode as an "expression of personal emotion", preferring instead the idea
that the lyric process is an "exploration of ((personal) emotion)". An
exploration, possibly a discovery, but unlikely to be referred to as an
experiment.

I hope I'm not coming across as a nit-picker - just intrigued by the
clouds of possible meanings that surround these words.


        Cheers &c,

A certain amount of the moronic is a staple for much of rock music's
poetics:

                Well last year I was twenty-one,
                Didn't have a lot of fun;
                Now I'm gonna be twenty-two,
                I say oh my and a boo-hoo
                                [Iggy Pop]

I would argue that lyrics become poetic primarily in their delivery, which
is why Dylan is poetic and Jim Morrison is not, why Iggy Pop is poetic and

        Sad preacher nailed upon the colour door of time,
        Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme,
        There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
        Political ends as sad remains will die.
        Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you.
                                        [Jon Anderson]

is not.  Scan these two excerpts, go ahead.  Iggy gives us a little iambic
tetrameter, Anderson pens an almost perfect string of alexandrines.  As
far as content, the latter is perhaps more poetic, though far less
intelligible and almost opaque in its aspirations for literariness.  But
Iggy means what he says and you know it in his delivery, especially when
he proceeds in the song to let out a series of whoops! and yelps! and
yrrrowps! that only he can do.  (Nick Cave comes awfully close, as does
Cobain in his own way.)  In short, as much as I like Yes, Iggy has more
poetry in his thumbnail than Anderson does.

Cobain's "a mosquito/my libido" has something Iggy-esquely moronic about
it, but does it fail as a poetic image?  (Libido is small, pesky,
displaces blood-as-food with toxin-as-irritant, etc.)  It's
not a reading I would want to push too far, of course.  But with "In
Utero," Cobain pushes "teen angst" (another rock staple) into a kind
of unparalleled confessionalism (given what we know about the lengths he
went to to seek relief for his chronic stomach trouble):

                I'm on warm milk and laxatives,
                Cherry-flavored antacid.

Again, not terribly poetic by most standards.  What about

                doll steak
                test meat

Evocative, perhaps; poetic?  Hard to say, until you factor in the
raw and dare I say bloodcurdling delivery.

Not having read any of Nick Cave's published writings, I can't really make
a thorough case--given also that some of fun lyrics on Birthday Party
albums are not by him ("Capers," Genevieve McGuckin; "A Dead Song," Anita
Lane; "The Dim Locator," Rowland S. Howard).  Cave does give us, however:

                I believe our man's in love
                Hamlet's got a gun--now

As someone who is on the "margins" of poetry I'm a little confused.  It seems to
me that poetry is experimental (avant garde?) and academic, formal, free
verse, traditional, etc., are offshoots (albeit reified) of this.  I have a
feling many lay people would agree?

I think we do.

From the perspective of science (I am one of those, too.): "
experimentation...is designed to detect causal agency.  One does something
to the world and then looks to see whether it has an effect." (from the
latest _Am. Jl of Psychology_ sitting on my desk)

  that which is effecting?

to continue: "As described by [the classic psychological reference on
psychology] 'true' experiments incude contrasts (i.e., controls) as a means
of ruling out rival plausible alternative explanations for any 'effects'
observed."

Are the "effects" of reading a poem due to the poem or the air in the room?

These 'effects' might or might not be replicable in further experimental trials.

I realize I'm being argumentative and do apologize for the possibility of
this being taken in that sense, but like you I do feel this is an important
issue.

Eryque,

Your man is Colin Morton. He's a poet and a good concrete poet. That film
he did with folk in Winnipeg, I believe. In oTtawa he founded First Draft,
a sound poetry performance group that empphasized script over
improvisation (some tapes still kicking around), in the 80s. I agree, it's
a great short film. He's at  aa905@freenet.carleton.ca

Newsweek Letters Editor:

The sorry state of the San Francisco Public Library
("A Mall for the Mind," The Arts, Oct. 14) shows no sign of
improving: books are still being dumped, there's a $1.9
million deficit, and Mayor Willie Brown has called for an audit.
City Librarian Ken Dowlin and his administration are indeed
intent on recreating the public library in the image of the
shopping mall. Their "public-private partnership" opens the door
wide to corporatist ideology, which aims at enclosing and
profiting from "the commons of knowledge." In decades past
San Franciscans were the first to resist the effects of
unchecked freeway building; Nicholson Baker and
friends may well have started an information freeway revolt.

There's a rumour that in Vancouver experimental dildoes are rapidly
becoming mainstream due to some programmes at Simon Fraser University
aimed at getting your ordinary sex shoppe consumer to "try on" and
"explore" something a little different. It's widely believed that the
researchers will now be eligible for Nobel prizes.

There was also recent talk in the media here that the Royal Bank, as
part of its campaign to take away business from the Bank of Montreal,
has bought some other lyrics from Dylan and is now mounting a national

way the wind blows." Aging Canadian "boomers" are reportedly up in

I for one would agree with this.  & I like Tom Beard's suggestion that
"explore/discover" might work better than "experiment" to describe what's
involved in most bona fide poetry.  But the experimental method is only
a part of the scientific method, which involves exploring & measuring
possibilities.  As Tom Mandel mentioned, there's probably a lot of
previous talk on this line in the archives.

But this leads me to another battleground... this debate over Potts &
the marginalization of the experimental reminds me of the Sokal flapdoodle.
Tony asks whether there is an element of self-marginalization (internalizing
the oppressor?) involved. It seems to me there is in the process of making
poetry a range or oscillation between the freedom of pure formal playing
around & on the other hand a powerful impulse to formulate (in a scientific
sense) - to bring things together, to comprehend, and to communicate these
comprehensions.  The new amalgams of understanding may be extremely
precise, narrow & refined in an aesthetic sense & in the sense of a "message":
this tends to create a superficial likeness between the two ends of the
spectrum (pure play & new communication).

Now if your writing tends toward the first - pure play, art for art's sake -
then in a work-driven conflicted world, this seems to entail marginalization.
& if your writing aims toward the second, the same may be true!  but not
so automatically, not so necessarily.  In the second hand there's are
real comprehensive/communicative push, that may extend beyond the borders
of art per se.

I know people are fed up with such abstract formulations.  But what I'm
trying to suggest is that perhaps there's a "basic theoretical poetry"
just as there's a "basic theoretical science", and if this is the case,
caution is called for before politicizing either "experimental" or
"mainstream" on behalf of a political slant (either the politics of
publication & literary clout, or politics per se).  - Henry Gould

Subject:      Meeting the poet through the poem

It may just be a feature of living the other
side of an ocean away from most of the living poets
I read, but I have often found that the piece of
writing I most like is done by the writer I most
want to meet as a person; ie not just intelligent
and artful but human. Yet it's often said (to readers?)
that they will only be disappointed, I haven't found
this. I think this certainly about Carla Harryman,
who was the first Language Writer I really really
liked and the first I met; the 2 or 3 conversations
I've had in person with her feel like the biggest
reading poetry buzz, not like from "fame" but that
private thing of a book you read and the words in
you reading.
        Has anyone else found this? Feeling the
writer is a companion just from the text, then
finding it so?

Best

to thomas orange's long post abt rock lyrics i must add my cents x2.
i think the point about how delivery, or, as i'd say in other contexts, context
itself, can make something poetic.  this is something that's often often
overlooked in these page-based discussions.  there are many instances in which
the banal can be transfigured by the power of a situation or the power of
delivery.  or when, embedded in the banal, a gem of "originality" leaps out
--but it's the context that makes that originality gemlike...etc.

not that i have much stake in the discussion of what constitutes "avant garde"
and what is "mainstream" --i've kept out of the discussion so far, but now i
guess my logorrhea's caught up w/ me:
i have been interested in the reception of my only book,which has the word
"vanguard" in its title.  most of my readership seems to be among writers and
scholars interested in the avant-garde as a reified literary canon of writers
and styles, whereas i was --and am --interested more in a process of
being-out-on-a-limb for a cross-section of writers.  thus i wrote abt robert
lowell who would not qualify as "avant garde" by just about any standards, but
who undertook an exploratory self-refashioning when he adopted the confessional
mode.  i paired lowell with some girls writing in a ged program in a south
boston housing project.  for me, this section wsa the most exciting. for others
it counted only as a brave attempt to make "bad poetry" relevant.  for me, it
wasn't bad poetry and i wasn't on a missionary trip.  i liked it. so, what's my
point. i notice i'm rambling in the fields of personal anecdote, or, as kenneth
koch sez of wordsworth, "nosing along in the shallows."  i guess i agree with
those on this list who would like to widen the sense of "experimental" toward
process rather than categorizable product. doing so seems to make possible a
broader range of interesting readings of all texts.  at the same time, i have
found that "experimental poetry" in the reified sense has been a terrific
pedagogical tool for accomplishing that "defamiliarization" russian formalists
posit as the trademark of literary language --the students are plunged
immediately into the realm of the literary with no recourse, initially, to their
recuperative quotidien narratives.  but then again, maybe shakespeare
accomplishes that for them too.

Subject:      close readings

I think Keith Tuma makes some good points about the necessity of close
readings of poets across the boundaries of various "genre" limitations.
LIke you, Keith, I share some interest in "mainstream" poets--Frank
Bidart's pretty good, I like James Tate at times, and Frederick Turner
seems to me fascinating in his wrong-headed ambitions; his belief that
iambic pentameter is the natural rhythm of the human body strikes me as
almost as crazy as phrenology--I keep thinking that he must be suggesting
that if we went back to the earliest forms of human life, we'd find
cave writing in iambic pentameter.

I'm currently doing a rewrite of a piece "On the Lyric As Experimental
Possbility" which I originally published in Witz but have never been happy
with, and in the new version of that piece I do a close reading of poems
by Robert Pinsky and
Robert Hass along with a close reading of a recent poem by Jennifer Moxley
(her new book, IMAGINATIONS, just out from Tender Buttons, is a must) in
order to show how Jennifer's poem uses lyric to critique notions of
singular, contained, asocial identity that Haas and Pinsky put forward as
central to their work. Haas and Pinsky both finally settle on this notion
that desire is not socially mediated, but rather a fact of being
individual--one of the high points for Pinsky being when he suggests of
people that "some like chocolate in the middle of the night" while others
do not. Moxley, on the other hand, draws attention to the socially
mediated aspects of her desires, while at the same time suggesting that
attention to particularities and differences in issues of desire remain
relevant.

On the other hand, in doing such close readings, I often feel like I'm
wasting time writing about poetry whose assumptions trouble me when I
would prefer to write about poetry I like. There's the famous Frank O'Hara
quote that Charles Bernstein was fond of using to me and others when I was
a graduate student, a quote I'm going to paraphrase here--"Why write about
poetry you don't like? History will take care of it for you." That
position seems too hopeful to me, finally, but nonetheless, I do see the
point of spending the little time I do have for critical writing on work
that's congenial to me.

        It's a thorny problem, in any case.

        Mark Wallace

Have you read Mandelstam's essay "On the Interlocutor"?  He talks a lot
about the distant reader, the reader in the future.

I agree with what you said about the charisma aspect (maybe charisma has
the wrong connotations).  But then, people are complex(!!).  I remember
reading somewhere about the Italian partisans who captured Ezra Pound,
how one or a few of them said he was immediately likeable, that he
seemed like an extraordinary, a "good" man.  These were the same
partisans in a death-struggle with Nazis & collaborators. - Henry Gould

Spahr (long work), Davis 19  at Poetry City


Time: S (17 mins), D (30 mins)
Attendance: 40


Setting a land speed record (and reminding many in the audience of Husker
Du's best work), Juliana Spahr read from her long work "Live" at Poetry
City last Friday. "What some of you fond of gerunds might call 'being
human'", "or inappropriate 'uh'", "have you done mean things to people on
purpose?", "methodologically sound if safely unsexy", "I may be ready to be
a New York poet, I am beginning to know my way around", "I no longer take
offense to New York-centric statements". Rhythmically, Spahr returned often
to the pattern of "You or I are turning some man-or-woman head". Spahr gave
an exciting, continuous-seeming reading, which was the opening half of this
rain make-up doubleheader. She wore a black knit top, flower-print pants,
and black shoes.

After a twelve-minute intermission, Anna Malmude introduced the second
reader. Tim Davis, dressed in black jacket (with two pens like fangs in the
breast pocket), black jeans, black wing-tips, and a grey buttoned-up shirt,
maintained a laugh-to-poem ratio of almost 2 throughout the reading, which
included poems from his new book, _My Life in Politics, or a History of
N=A=R=R=A=T=I=V=E Film_. The main part of his 19-poem reading was a series
of poems written while on lunch break from his Eighth Avenue office. Forget
Laughlin, cable Ferlinghetti--these are the lunch poems we've been waiting
for. "This is the blankety all of content dependeth on", "Manhattan held a
fenfull", "hulky run of buzzer doors", "a tremendous verse blew in",
"yoo-hoo you", "another nestegg weasel rain", "take that acre, mule, and
lurk in it", "all of history's letterhead", "a snuff film of butterflies
running things", "This writing is Sudetenland", "stapled to a frappe", "a
fart of cold, cold Rolaids", "Roger Rilke, over", "has-been ISBNS over and
over...", "file under rank", "Grandma fingered a Fed", "gauze is good",
"Uncle Duh had opened a glass of sash", "the bantu Jackie Coogan", "eau de
Nickelodeon", "is this a delicious baloney?", "a crow in every ficus". I
could go on, and so could Tim, whose side comments and pauses were
flawless.

In the audience alternately rapt and howling were: Bill Luoma, Brian Kim
Stefans, Bernadette Mayer, Phil Good, Barbara Henning, Anselm Berrigan,
Kevin Davies, Deirdre Kovac, Jeff Hull, Brenda Coultas, Eleni Sikelianos,
Tim Griffin, Brigham Taylor, Judith Goldman, Kim Rosenfield, Rob Fitterman,
Liz Fodaski, Dug Rothschild, Larry Fagin, Charles Weigl, Chris Stroffolino,
Doug Stone, Catherine Talese, Nick Ciraldo, Alystyre Julian and Judean
Patten.

Once again, the Cedar's upstairs seating was closed for renovation. The
post-reading crowd also found itself closed out of the Old Town Bar (this
is why readings in New York on Friday nights are no good -- no place to
take everybody afterwards), which had room at the bar, but no place to sit.
Tim volunteered his Ave A apartment, bought pizzas, many brought beer, and
the group carried on for several hours more.

Schedule notices: This week, Poetry City goes back to its usual Thursday
night slot with Poetry Project workshop leader Todd Colby and Cinema of
Transgression inventor Nick Zedd. On Halloween, Poetry City will host San
Franciscan Steve Carll and Stuyvesant town's own Carol Malmude Szamatowicz.
And on 11/7 at 7 p.m., John Wieners and Eleni Sikelianos.

I keep asking History to take care of things for me, and it don't say a word.

Once, a few years ago, Hegel showed up on my doorstep, with his dirty owl and
a stick of bubblegum marked "Eastern Europe."  He said, "Chew on this Dude."
I said "It ain't Halloween yet, MasterNarrative, get that bird off my porch."

He said he'd be back.

This about the "primary" meaning of a word in science when applying it to
another field is deeply distrubing -- we're not talking about quarks here
-- as it wd. severely narrow the usage of an old and capacious term.  My
OED (admittedly the old edition -- I have to join that book clud so I can
afford the newerversion) -- cites, to our point -- Kimble, 1878 "Though a
poet should have a strongly passionate nature . . .he should . . . be
able to expermentalize with it"


OED's first def. is "the action of trying anything, or putting it to
proof; a test, trial" -- clearly, that which is put to proof is not
restricted to hypotheses -- and their is "experiment" in its theological
sense -- "to have experience of" -- Caxton, 1483 -- "And these thynges
sene and experymented, Esope returned to his labors"

I have nbo problem with scientists using the word "experiment," as they
have for centuries -- but I would hate to think that the word was to
taken away from these other domains of experimental abuse --

"no problem," that is --

The term "experimental" poetry causes a rucus whenever it appears, but it
appears to me to combine deliciously two of the oldest senses of the word --

But maybe this sense of mine dates to my days as an experimental Baptist --

this is not, by the way, experimental spelling -- You can tell when I'm
away from my San Jose State office by the percentage of errors in my
transmissions

H, I think there may be a a "basic theoretical poetry."
It would be that poetry is the type of writing that most resists
decontextualization. The Chomsky/Whorf debate applies here-- but seems to me
one cld argue Chomsky's deep structure also, or complimentarily, gives a view
of language which honors the primacy of the individual.  Seems to me the
resistance to politicization is a very american phenomenon. In other
industrial countries people still have a sense of the importance & value of
their political opinions-- some degree of efficacy. Though that difference is
disappearing as the global americanization (i.e. corporatization) continues.

Rod, I agree with you completely (I think).  See F. Oh'Hara's "Personism" on
abstraction & individual.  Nor did I mean to put down the useless play
side of basic poetry.  But if there's a "cognitive" side to it, an
experimental discovery side of it, then there's no need to try to
politicize mainstream/experimental.  ALL authentic stuff is inherently
experimental.  And the cognitive/communicative aspect of the experiment
may be less obviously experimental on the formal side while VERY
"experimental" in the political/communicative side.

What I don't agree with is academic phantom politics.  The hoot & holler
of us vs them, as if "new writing" = vanguard politics.  To me that's
a politically-correct smokescreen for very tiny office politics.

Now available from primitive publications -- "Lead, Glass and Poppy," by
Kristin Prevallet, a riveting work incorporating past and present news
stories into a "millennial convergence poem."

About this chapbook, Mark Wallace writes: "Kristin Prevallet's work
presents a distinctly modern witchery, a series of spells and
counterspells designed to drive us from complacency with a
paradoxically generous black magic.  In her new chapbook, 'Lead, Glass
and Poppy,' Kristin details exactly what happens when human beings
take off blithely for the sun; they experience intense heat, destructive
fallout, and the debris of deluded dreams.  What surprise, then, that they
find themselves once more in the chaotic history of misunderstood
desires for transcendence."

primitive publications produces approximately six chapbooks a year,
focusing on present-day writing based on historical text, language or
subject.  Cost of one chapbook is $4.00, or $20.00 for a subscription of
six.  Other titles include:

The History of the State May Last, 1616, by Mary Hilton
The Haunted Baronet, by Mark Wallace

Henry Gould, oh no, I wasn't in the least bothered abt
self-marginalization -- I happily marginalize my"self"
all the livelong day etc. when left to my own devices.
I was hoping that Thomas Bell might know something more than
I cd guess at abt the motivation of the debate going on: more than
anything I was interested to read Ira Lightman wanting to defend
Potts who had in Steve Evans's view written a  kind
of review in which marginalizing or victimising further the victims of
marginalization seemed to be so clearly displayed. You know, a
psychoanalytic view of the whole performance wd not be amiss.

What sort of crazinesses are poetic ambitions? What is to be gained?
in fact? in imagination?

Subject:      What is a library?

Having grown up with no more books in the house than Readers Digest
Condensed novels and that wonderfully named low-end encyclopedia, The
Book of Knowledge, I've had a lifelong appreciation for the
transformative impact that a library (specifically the old Albany
Public Library on Solano, now closed and moved a block hence to a large
new postmodern space) had on my life. I first read Williams' The Desert
Music there at age 16 and understood for the first time that poetry
would be my calling.

Much of what is going in SF with the new library is the fruition of
many years of struggle over the direction of that place. Melissa Riley,
who may be known to many on this list, has been involved in this for
years -- the elimination of real librarians in the neighborhood
libraries, the reduction of books, the elimination of neighborhood
libraries themselves, etc.

But it's a two sided tale at the very least. One of the architects of
the library, Cathy Simon (who is married to the poet Michael Palmer)
discusses the project in detail in an article in Representations 42,
Spring 1993 (a special issue on "Future Libraries" that remains the
best single edition of that journal, one that can be said to be truly
devoted to policy in the literal sense of polis, worth reading cover to
cover).

Speaking of Michael Palmer, who last I heard was fond of writing in the
Mission Branch of the SF Public Library, does anyone have an email
address for the man?

All best,

Ron Silliman

Subject:      A Parade of Theories

At 4:44 PM
           the thing we like about poetry
is the uncertainty

At 9:05 AM we are certain about long-term value

                        Years ago, Fed
economists tracked corrugated-box sales
(a lot of stuff is packed in boxes). More
recently, Mr. Greenspan's command of
obscure statistics has ranged from scrap-
metal prices (often rising in good times)
to railroad carloadings (they also move
stuff). And with nothing more than an
offhand comment at a congressional hear-
ing, he has vaulted to market-moving
status such arcana as the diffusion index of
supplier-delivery lags (how long it takes
for raw materials to reach factories). The
dollar, the trade deficit, the price of gold
and, most recently, the monthly unemploy-
ment report have taken center stage.

At 8:40 PM I have to explain that the lack of experientia
is post-ironic, that the measure that puts youth and
youthful response with Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones puts
Reagan in office, and that the sensuous experience of biting
my fingernail is one I can enjoy at any of my nine jobs

The mayor of Algiers was shot to death in
the Algerian capital. Witnesses and French
media say the official died in an ambush of
his motorcade by Muslim fundamentalist
rebels, but the Algerian government said he
was struck by a stray bullet at his home.

The problem Mark mentions is one I've often been bothered by myself.
Writing well about poetry, in my experience, requires giving the poetry
in question a *lot* of time and attention, and i'd just rather lavish
that effort on poetry i like.  And i'm afraid the temptation wld be
strong, in writing about poetry i *don't* like, to not do it even the
justice it deserves.

This also intersects with a point I think Dodie raised about writers being
free to dismiss work not useful to them.  The poet in me feels this
strongly, while the critic in me feels an obligation to be more fair-minded,
and attentive.  This is a dynamic that might be worth exploring in some
detail.  I'm quite aware, for ex., that just because certain work doesn't
have value for me doesn't mean it might not be worthwhile for someone else.
But I'm not sure the poet part of me, which has good reasons for ignoring
or maybe even hating this work, wld allow the critic part to do a fair
critical job of work on it.  steve

What else is new in Byzantium?
This just in:
Fr. Bookotopos lambasted the iconoclasts again without leaving
his chair, denouncing their position that the image proceeds
directly and a-politically from the logos by way of the ouzia
through the sun via the Cross-Bronx E.

Fr. Gouldoparrotalkis offered a triple analogy between language
poetics & the sheepshank or bowline version of Joycotopolis's
_Finneganousius' Testament to the Hippogriffians_.

Ah, I've been hoping the song/poetry thread would get around to him, so
here goes: basically "they" are John Darnielle, though his friend Rachel is
enough a part of the band to justify the plural, I guess. He's been part of
the "Inland Empire" So.Cal. cassette scene for a long time. He also has
several CDs; they should be available at indie record stores. I would say
_Zopilote Machine_ or _Sweden_ would be the places to start--the others are
still great but (to put it simply) they don't have as many songs.

John's been trying to get into grad school in Classics, which explains the
liner notes in Latin and the songs written from the p.o.v. of Roman
emperors.
He also has some idiosyncratic views on the history of American lit; you
can follow this link --
http://www.duke.edu/~jnn/mountain_goats/mg.html
-- to transcribed lyrics and some essays he's written about walt whitman
and the bi-fi revolution. In his songs, all sorts of difficulties (history,
literature, language & personal relationships) get wrapped up into intense
little bursts of words that are usually narratives about places he's never
been and people he's never known. Though I think he goes to Sweden some.

from "alpha incipiens" on Zopilote Machine:

i'm trying to piece together what you're saying
but the birds are screeching, the hounds are baying
i don't remember there being any hounds around here


And if the Alistair Galbraith/Mtn Goats tour comes through your town, I
would go see it, it will be worth the effort more than likely.

I'm aware of all these problems, too, and I'm very aware of it, and that
these are problems that we share, and we can, I think we can talk about
these problems in an aware way, but not too far away as to be invisible.
I'm aware of the philosopher side of me, I am because that side
peels the onions to spite the horse of French philosophy - except to the
neglect of the transportation clerk side of me who is really much like a
historian side of a rare element like selenium seen through the microscope
of a fungal specialist, a wrong side "detailleur" (as Frennch rugby
players call the action of their heels) who asks for extra pancakes syrop
and butter at the annual stampede breakfast. So, the idealism of onions
any day of the week versus the self-interested transgressive sugar-load
only on holidays: these are the positions that I am aware of holding while
reading closely, and between the two I tarnish balefully sodden, until the
enlightenment of my friends on this list encunted the discussion further
than expected.

That was Ron Silliman.

Curious, because that was the poem that did it for me, too. I had been in
the air force, and now here i was back at university, reading my way
through the PS books, and finally I got to WCW, and when I opened that
book, I was so alarmed that I dropped it onto the floor, great noise. Hey,
come to think of it, I will be teaching it late in November.

though i enjoyed roger and me, i did take exception to the scenes in san
francisco, where the voice-over scornfully reports that "everyone had a job but
nobody seemed to be working" cuz they were all in cafes drinking their fancy
coffee drinks, which they actually enjoyed as drinks, rather than simply as
bitter-tasting stimulants for more productive facctory work.  what i didn't like
was the assumption that the virtuous model for work was the suffering, factory,
timeclock type of work.  flexible or self-determined schedules, the enjoyment of
leisure and the ability to be creative in cafes rather than on the assembly line
are clearly symtoms of coastal decadence, trivial and shallow.

To all of you who have been talking about Scott Walker, hooray for "Tilt"
and so forth, but my favorites are still the Walker Brothers records,
especially the Burt Bacharach-Hal David numbers.  Wayne Smith and I wrote a
play about a year ago and used Scott's version of "The Windows of the
World" throughout.  (It was a play about window dressers who dream of
achieving fame as fine artists, so it "fit" kind of.  Now I undersand there
is a whole CD mined from the London archive of Scott Walker singing Burt
Bacharach including one duet with my other favorite Dusty Springfield.  Al
Nielsen is right, Scott is the sexiest man in the world, and George
Bowering, you probably did hear the Walker Brothers at least once upon a
time, they had the #1 hit on the world charts at just about the same time
you were writing your great poem "Brown Globe."  ("You poets out there, if
you still read words,/ Try to say something to me...."

I am thrilled (and that doesn't happen too much am afraid) that there are
some Scott fans on this list. It's interesting because some of the old
Scott fans hate his new music. As for myself it is an interesting bridge
from old Scott to new Scott.  He never looks back and just goes forward.  I
think TILT is just a beautiful record.  Has anyone on the list read the
Scott bio put out by Virgin in England?  NoT bad music bio. At one point he
was working with Eno and Daniel L...  I forgot his last name, but he is the
guitar player that played with Eno and produced U2, ETC.  Well, anyway
Daniel's habit of wearing a scarf around his head really bugged Scott.
Scott ended the sessions.  Now that's what I call artistic temperment!

tosh

PS  One should also buy the Walker Bros. NITE FLIGHT album.  It was just
re-issued and the Scott songs are similar to Bowie's Low period. I am sorry
but this is poetry too!

Haven't responded to any of the music threads yet because I've
been finishing up an English album which, for my penance, Steve
C., I was forced to do in the keyboard style of *George Martin*.
(And yes, Martin could be pretty great--but that was thirty years ago,
for Christ's festering sake! *Why*, God, why do producers always make
me recap pop music history 101, bitch moan whine, etc etc [pause
while correspondent straps mutated bees to his palms, aims the
pulsating thoraxes at his temples and drenches his own face in
carcinogenic bug goo]...but I digress. And no, I'm not dissing
the B's, I'm dodging my recent repertoire.)

Will get to that hardy handful in the next few days, but in the meantime:

I love the Mountain Goats unequivocally and have since last fall.
John Darnielle is a funny and literate songwriter, that's
for subjective certain. And to those who don't get the deadpan
folk-music demeanor, I say:

"There are certain things about gardening you should know."--TMG

Rob Hardin

PS: I've been asked to submit ideas for interviews with musicians
to _Bomb_ and have been thinking about George Perle, Helios Creed,
Six-Finger Satellite and Bloody Valentine (because of the textures).
But the Mountain Goats are just about perfect because they haven't
really broken and are unashamedly literary. (Apparently, Bloody Val
is "too new to be a classic but too old to be current." Which doesn't
matter to me, but it definitely seems to matter to _Bomb_.)

If anyone knows how to get in touch with Darnielle, please backchannel
the necessary info my way. Otherwise: until tomorrow.

See you then then.

Henry -- don't know if you're response to the cited news of yet another
killing in Algiers is not a bit off. Those killings are real -- a parade
of real deaths, not a parade of theories -- even if the geography, the
facts, &/or the reproting may seem byzantine. A year and a half ago -- &
reported in the same manner -- a friend, an Algerian poet, was shot to
death. Here is what I wrote then (& published in SULFUR 34) --

Pierre=09


        Our eyes are fixed on the TV screen or the New York Times Op-Ed page,
transfixed & horrified, emptied & blinded by what is happening in
ex-Yugoslavia, in the ex-Soviet Union & its ex-satellites, that is, as
usual, in ex-Europe & its ex-tensions. Blinded thus, we know little, if
anything, about what is happening =97 the horror, the horror, to use a
famous fictional European's dying words =97 in other parts of the world, =
&
the media is certainly not going to deal with it unless it has some kind
of marketable Euro-American angle. The quasi-civil war in Algeria, for
example, is going largely unreported, except when a few  weeks ago when
the ex-FIS (the outlawed fundamentalist Islamic party which, having more
or less won the democratic elections a year ago, was sidelined by the
FLN, the corrupt ex-revolutionary party that has been in power since
independence in 1962, on which it has declared war) stated that to
hasten its purification of the country it would kill all foreigners in
Algeria (Twenty four were killed by the end of December.) Dozens of
Algerians are being killed daily on both sides.  The FIS's assassination
strategy is simple: kill off the intelligentsia & anybody else able to
voice any intelligent opposition  =97 or at least enough of them as goryl=
y
as possible to make the rest shut up or leave the country for fear of
dying. Among the many killed this past year were two poets: Tahar
Djaout, who was shot May 26 and Youssef Sebti, who was knifed to death
on December 28 as he was going to his job teaching sociology in a
college of agronomy in the suburbs of Algiers. They were killed because
they were, quietly and seriously, going about their business as writers
& would not shut up, but kept writing & saying what needs to be said:
that totalitarianism under any guise, religious or military, is the
ultimate evil.  In an eerie, prophetic mood, Tahar Djaout, more than
twenty years ago, wrote a poem that celebrated the independence of his
country, but that was simultaneously an elegy for the writer Mouloud
Feraoun who had been assassinated towards the end of the war of
independence in not dissimilar circumstances & for not dissimilar
reasons:              =20

MARCH 15, 1962

how to curb their rage to dissolve the stars            =09
and to birth eternal night
I challenge their iron
and the enraged ire with which they multiply the chains

in the blue smile
of the Admiralty open on the promises
today in long swallows I gulp
=97 sun thundering over Algiers =97
the joys of a feasting
where resurrected dawns gambol=20
and yet I think on the holocausts
unleashed to make dawn break
I think of Feraoun
=97 smile frozen in the sun's circumcision

they are afraid of the truth
they are afraid of the straight pen
they are afraid of truly human humans
and you, Mouloud, you insisted and  spoke
about wheat fields for the sons of the poor
and spoke of pulverizing all the barbed wire
that lacerated our horizons

they speak of you and say that you were too good
that you felt revolted
hearing shells greet each dawn
that you believed human beings to be born so as to be brothers
and though challenging all the orgies of horror
you were incapable of hatred

one day, Mouloud, goodness finally triumphed
and we could wear the sun's trident
and we could honor the memory of the dead
because
        with
          your hands, those gleaners of dawn's mysteries,
and your dreamy inveterate poet's face,
you have known how to fulfill our truths
written in sun scraps
on the breasts of all those who revolt

well as to moore:  i do have problems with his (at times) overwrought
working class ethos, as maria suggests (the same problems i have with ben
hamper's ethos in _rivethead_, the book that inspired moore's flick _roger
and me_)... and no way do i condone moore's not paying his collaborator for
services rendered, if this is indeed the case...

but as to the film's manipulations:  problem i'm having here is that it's
so damned EASY to say this about that film... there are parts where i groan
aloud at his stagings... but one might observe, quite justifiably, that
moore is fighting fire with fire... and yes, one might likewise find this
strategy regrettable...

but where's the public sentiment that acknowledges, at the same time, gm's
manipulations---the sorts of shenanigans that gm has been up to for decades
now?... along with the rest of the auto industry?...

i'm not defending moore, i'm just asking why we should bother dissecting
his film WITHOUT a corresponding dissection of gm, and gm's shitty
treatment of workers and unions?... or is moore's the last word on same?
(in which event, his flick should be seen as even more valuable, no?)...

this is the same old same old of liberal discourse, isn't it?... we're real
good at critiquing liberal motives (i.e., ourselves), but not so good at
situating such motives over and against the real problem... and i guess i
have to observe here, a bit cranky this morning, that the real problem is
not moore---but gm, and what companies like gm do---to people like us...

to wit:  if moore had met his obligations to his collaborator(s), if moore
had not staged various scenes in his film, would the truth about gm be
somehow less painful?...  and if this isn't the point, then talking about
moore, again, is at best talk about how the left shoots itself in the
foot---which discussion, in the absence of informed discussion about gm's
motives, might itself amount to shooting ourselves in the foot...

apologies to those on the right//

I agree with you, Pierre; I regretted sending one more silly post to the
list, after the fact.  I'm curious about how the contemporary situation in
the west echoes ancient world politics going back, literally,
to Byzantium.  But by combining that with a take-off on some of the
"byzantine" characteristics of the poetics list (a satire on myself, more
than anybody else), the result was sadly more truly "byzantine" (in a negative
sense - airy, abstract, divorced from real life) & cynical-sounding than
I hope to be.  I'm glad you called me on it. - Henry G.

National Endowment for the Arts and the Benton Foundation Launch "Open
Studio: The Arts Online"

Unprecedented Collaboration Creates Community Access Sites at Arts and
Cultural Institutions in All 50 States


(Washington, DC) -- The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the
Benton Foundation today announced the nation's first initiative to provide
community access to the arts on the Internet at sites in all 50 states as
well as propel the nonprofit arts online by helping them to become
effective information providers on the World Wide Web.

This new $1 million initiative, called Open Studio: The Arts Online, is an
unprecedented collaboration between the NEA and the Benton Foundation to
help nonprofit arts organizations and artists go online, increase the arts
and cultural presence on the Internet, expand the online arts audience, and
provide public Internet access at arts and community institutions.  Open
Studio is funded through an NEA Leadership Initiative award of $500,000,
which the Benton Foundation is committed to matching as part of a
cooperative agreement.

"The National Endowment for the Arts was created to make the arts
accessible to all people of all backgrounds in every district of the
nation," NEA Chairman Jane Alexander said. "Open Studio is a groundbreaking
project that will increase cultural and arts resources on the information
superhighway and make the Internet a reality for people everywhere."

"This project is about ensuring a public culture," said Larry Kirkman,
executive director of the Benton Foundation. "We must work to protect
noncommercial public space in the digital age. Artists and arts
institutions, schools, libraries, as well as other independent voices must
be able to make their noncommercial imprint on American cultural life and
values."

The two components of Open Studio include:

        1) Free Community Access to the Internet
        More than 100 public access points to the Internet will be set up
in arts organizations and culturally-oriented community centers in every
state.  Through this initiative, members of the public who are interested
in accessing the Internet can receive personal assistance helping them
learn how to browse the Web and access its cultural resources.  Access
sites will receive a matching award of $2,000 to $4,000.



        2) Helping Artists & Arts Organizations Become Effective
Information Providers on the Web
        Ten institutions with existing telecommunications resources, such
as libraries, universities, and community telecommunications centers, will
each receive up to $35,000 to serve as mentors to 10 local cultural
organizations and 10 local artists, teaching them how to become effective
information providers on the World Wide Web.

        The trainees will then mentor another organization or artist within
a year of completing their own training. By the autumn of 1997, this
program will generate an Internet presence for 200 arts organizations and
artists with 200 more in training.


Fourteen pilot sites (see attached list) are being launched on October 22,
1996. Remaining sites will be selected through a competitive process, with
awards announced in February 1997. Information about applying for site
awards may be obtained by sending email to mentorrfp@benton.org (for mentor
awards) or accessrfp@benton.org (for access awards) or by visiting the Open
Studio Web site at www.openstudio.org.   The Open Studio Web site also
serves as a public clearinghouse for project information, including a
project description and status reports.

A national advisory group will guide Open Studio. A list of committee
members is attached. The Benton Foundation has recently hired Anne Green as
the project coordinator for Open Studio.  Ms. Green, who has a law degree
from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, was most recently the
coordinator of People For the American Way's artsave Project, a nationwide
research and public education project in the visual and performing arts.

Open Studio is an integral part of an overall effort by the NEA to extend
its public outreach and serve the arts and the public more effectively
through the Internet. In April, the Arts Endowment launched its own Web
site at arts.endow.gov. The site includes a monthly magazine, a guide to
the Arts Endowment, and an art resource center.

The NEA, which has a $99.5 million budget this year, is the federal
grantmaking agency created by Congress in 1965 to foster the excellence,
diversity, and vitality of the arts in the United States and to broaden
public access to the arts. NEA Leadership Initiatives were created in
fiscal year 1996 to sponsor specific initiatives for projects of national
significance and impact, or those that serve as models in one field or
discipline.

The Benton Foundation, dedicated to protecting the public interest in the
digital age, has long been a proponent for providing noncommercial public
space in the new communications environment. The foundation's work ranges
from published work on connecting schools and public opinion research on
libraries to national policy summits on communications policy and practices
in the public interest and the creation of a communications hub to link
children's advocates. More information about Benton, including publications
and cyber resource pages can be found at www.benton.org.

what i remember of seeing moore's roger and me was that the audience
was in stitches, as they say; they thought the thing was so damn funny;
now i knew it was being promoted as this wacky look at the
depradations of big bad businessman through they eyes of a
mischievous, famously defrocked magazine editor (remember mother
jones/paul berman snafu?), but i was sure the picture was hard-hitting
and unsettling.... which it was, I thought.
 and it seems to me that much of the drama and pathos that moore wrung
from the story had to do with the way he told it, edited it, the disregard
for chronology notwithstanding (who cares!); and yet his unflinching look
at a woman who butchered chickens or the poor dude who evicted
tenants was snickered at by my audience, as if these people were not
poor and down-trodden and victims of gm, but somehow laughably
hapless and stupid.

in some ways, or somehow, moore's film, in certain respects (jeez, what
 qualifiers!) the film was co-opted by a nervous establishment and made
into an acceptable comedy.

 did anyone out there have a simliar experience watching that  film, i
wonder...

joe i hear you.  and i agree.  moore is very effective at what he does.
the dc city paper likened it to inducing catholic guilt.  i dont quite
know how to respond to you though.  im wondering if . . . turning our
critical skills on ourselves is a good thing.  certainly organizations
need as much critique as anything but if we ourselves are above reproach
doesnt that assume a purity of the critique that does not exist?

I'm sorry, but I don't see the point of Ms. Change's actions, whom I've
never heard of before. The implosive act of suicide has always struck me as
the ultimate form of narcissism. Thank god, Gandhi, MLK, et al. never took
such an attitude. An "alarm against Armageddon?" More like another
advertisement.

michael i have to disagree with you.  it is worth caring about if a
writer/filmmaker/what have you "manipulates" the events to construct a
version of the "real" to suit political ends.  just because ones
sympathies are with the artist does justify not observing the way in
which s/he uses the medium.  nixon afterall was a master craftsman.  and
need we discuss REAGAN?  like i said: i liked the movie and i like
moore.  but that doesnt mean i dont care about how meanings are arrived at.
and as far as coopting the movie . . . well i think it would be difficult
to construe it as any sort of comedy--other than a darkly cynical one.
though of course it may have been marketed as such.  your audience and
personal experience may have been different but though woman (who
butchered rabbits by the way not chickens) and the sheriff certainly
elicted something more than simply derision by its viewers?

    Yes, michael coffey, it was marketed as a comedy, and the audience
that I saw it with in Detroit *did* snicker but I took it as a
nervous snicker in the face of blashpemy--I am from and saw the film
in an area of Detroit called Downriver where many of the big three's
line employees lived and attacking roger smith was fun but abt as fun
as cursing in church.  The Pets or Meat lady as she became know was
laughed at much as anyone considered retarded in grade school and it
rankled me that michael moore *encouraged* her to reveal her oddities--
it was hard to feel that the film wasn't mocking her, a serious problem.
But no one laughed at the evictor, and the most effecting
moment of the film was when it turns out the evictor was evicting a guy
mmoore had knew in high school--the scene on the porch in grey winter
day when that high school friend was turning his hostility towards
the evictor until moore prodded him to turn it outward to gm.  That moment
defined the ethics of moore's film for me, which I considered acceptable
tho his method as many point out was manipulative at the least.
(sidebar: yes maria damon it was a cheap shot at coffee house professionals
as well--another failure of mmoore's art, but it seems to me *that*
cheap shot was to appeal to the lowest common denominator in order
to galvinize the lowest commno denominator.  Moore's film wouldn't have
played well to his subject audience if he hadn't worn baseball hats
and made fun of a percieved elite.)
    to return to the other problem the film is shown mostly in art
houses such as the Detroit Institute of Arts whose patrons are mostly
execs in the auto industry and you can bet they laugh up a storm at
those left behind in the leaner meaner capital developing at the time.
    I live in Chicago now and the five years I've been here PBS has
played Roger and Me three times.  My question is why can a political
work only be granted an audience in such venues which may not be high
art to artists but to the culture as a whole...There are union people
who may watch pbs and go to art houses i'm sure but the key to galvinizing
the disenfranchised would not seem to be pbs.  In my view this is just
another way the whole system works against opposition.
    Sorry this post has rambled--and sorry it's not abt poetix (blush)
but one more thing--the reason Roger and Me was blasphemy is another
victory for corporate ideology--which I was told goes like this:
(the worker, with an exec sitting on his left shoulder) yes labor will
suffer but if we don't run the whole operation more cheaply in the
face of global competition the whole corporation will fail."
    No wonder I care so much abt the detroit tigers--that's the only
place for hope.

oh, mebbe i shouldn't apologize to the right...

that *was* an extremely grumpy post i posted this morning, and my day today
has paved the way for nothing but more grumpiness on my part (not to
worry---i won't indulge!)...

happy to hear moore is in _the nation_ (thanx eric), i'll check that out...
and no, jeffrey, you're quite right i think---we should be willing to
critique ourselves, certainly... i just don't hear this sentiment regularly
being expressed, say, by authority figures...

i think we oughtta be sure to specify the power relations as such... i
think moore's flick took it to the man, and yeah, michael---i think you may
be right, that _roger and me_ *was* in some respects taken as an excuse to
laugh it off, "it" here being our (u.s. i mean) nervous anxieties, aka our
economic insecurities... i mean, there's a certain degree of truthful
emotion that comes seeping out of that flick, esp. if you're the daughter
or son of a working-class family, or have had the shop-experience
first-hand... and laughter is one way to deal with despair...

Wonderful event organized by Bill Berkson at the Art Institute and
including many friends of the poets. McClure did a great reading and then
many others, including some mentioned below in a piece by me, read from
Whalen's work.The first quote is from the movie 12 Monkeys, the second from
Whalen's "Further Notice" in On Bear's Head.

from Ghost Atlas

5.

Home because migraine
Brain too cold or too large for head
Generations of poets marching through
Whalen/McClure birthday event
Keith Abbott saying Et en Arcadia etc.
And David Meltzer that time marches
All over one and looking somewhat trampled
Another widow among the readers
Himself but reads most
Musically of anyone
Ghosts off the scale that day
Disembodied voices facing
The wrong way into time

"It won't help you. It won't help others.
It won't change anything."

Leslie's frog erotics
Ditto Bob's sacramental distribution of the cake
A thousand years of catering in each gesture
Alice Notley predicts her own silence
Kit gets the laughs
"People see me; they like that . . .
I try to warn them it's really me."
Kevin Killian brings Eddie Berrigan like a child bride
Norman reads a Diamond Noodle counting poem
Is stunned to know you

Whalen unwilling love god
Sits like a scepter
Stands in slow motion
Blowing out candles which don't
Stay blown
No one objects to his perfection

Reminds me that Von Hallberg in his Olson book talks about how the 1st part
of Maximus is structured like a classical oration (Maximus was a sophist).

But "periods" are not just physical, they are also imaginary.  The trumpet
player solos across periods.  The rhythm of the language is translated
by the listener's (different) breathing.  - Henry G.

I finally got the news today: the poem was "Whatever you say say nothing",
which she had in Heaney's _New Selected Poems 1965 - 1987_, a book I dont
have. I do have this memory of having come across it somewhere, but...

On a related matter was rereading Gilbert Sorrentino's wonderfully outraged
review of _The Distances_ in his _Something Said_ to pass this early
response on to my class: all that anger, righteously & rightfully, against
what he calls the 'shameful' neglect of Olson by 'the cultural idiots of
our time.' Plus ca change?

Like Jordan, I would like to hear more about Tracie Morris's work.
She's an amazing poet and I love her work.  I've
been trying to get a copy of her book--even talked to her on the phone
about it--but to no avail.

her book is self-published, it's called Chap-t-her Won.  she's an amazing
performer--imitates hiphop technology's distortion of sound via scratching,
slowing down and speeding up the voice, etc.; and strong on the page too.
influenced by carmen mcrae and active in the black rock coalition.  maybe later
i'll type in a sample poem, but yu gotta see her live.
md  ps thanks for asking

Subject:      Whatever you say say nothing

Speaking of that poem (in which Heaney, anticipating his own later
celebrity, rhymes "Seamus" with "Famous"), there was an interesting booklet
on Heaney published in 1991 in Ireland, by Desmond Fennell, called WHATEVER
YOU SAY, SAY NOTHING: WHY SEAMUS HEANEY IS NO. 1.  The book is as brutal as
the title.  This is as far as I know the most severe attack on Heaney's
stature ever to be published in Ireland. Fennell's attack -- which basically
accused Heaney of careerism and political irresponsibility -- generated a
whole series of agonized letters in the IRISH TIMES defending Heaney.  The
book is problematic, but I think often on-target.  Goes on at length about
the role of the U.S. in making of poetic reputations, and what Fennell calls
"the gratuitous advantage of being a foreign poet" in the US.

Cheers,
David

thanx to joel felix for that on-the-spot evaluation of moore's flick, which
i found on-the-mark...

on a related note:  there are a number of anthologies (incl. two recent
ones reviewed in this month's _college english_) that deal with
working-class academics, and the sorts of conflicts that arise from this
conjuncture (incl. in particular language issues).. seems to me that this
sort of discourse is something we need more of, to try to grapple with our
(class-based) sense of propriety, fairness and such like... interestingly,
there's another piece in the same issue of _college english_ dealing with
the teaching of composition as a distinctively middle-class pursuit, an
idea that resonates well with dodie's ruminations on same in these
spaces...

best,

This is Dodie.  I got my degree in ESL (which I've never taught) from
Indiana University in Bloomington, where the program, in the mid-70s at
least, was called Urban and Overseas English. It was a horribly boring
program to my early twenties self.  But, eventually I became captivated by
the Urban wing, which involved studying Black English, a bit of a joke in
whitest of white Southern Indiana.  The class was taught by a white woman
who was rather absent, it was said, because she was going through a
divorce, and we would listen to tapess by Dick Gregory and appreciate them
together, and then we would study the syntax of Black English and
appreciate that together, and then we would study Black slang and
appreciate that together.  The one black woman in the class' speech
patterns were coveted like jewels.  For electives we took Black fiction and
Black poetry.  I took a rather sad course in the history of Black education
in America.  We were told that there was no such thing as standard English,
that we should appreciate the richness of all dialects.  And then we were
informed, that, let's face facts, if people are allowed to speak in this
rich dialect of Black English they weren't going to get anywhere in the
world, that we had to help enable them by attempting to teach them
standardized pronunciation and usage.  It was an ugly job, but somebody had
to do it.

I, of course, being young and idealistic, was appalled, felt like this
proposed occupation was evil like strip-mining.  I think Iam still
appalled.

david kellog wrote:

there was an interesting booklet on Heaney published in 1991 in Ireland,
about a book "by Desmond Fennell, called WHATEVER
YOU SAY, SAY NOTHING: WHY SEAMUS HEANEY IS NO. 1.  The book
is as brutal as the title.  This is as far as I know the most severe attack
on Heaney's stature ever to be published in Ireland. Fennell's attack --
which basically accused Heaney of careerism and political
irresponsibility -- generated a whole series of agonized letters in the
IRISH TIMES defending Heaney.  The book is problematic, but I think often
on-target.  Goes on at length about the role of the U.S. in making of poetic
reputations, and what Fennell calls
"the gratuitous advantage of being a foreign poet" in the US."

david, i have not read fennell's book, so i cannot take issue with that. But
i do feel compelled to ask  what charges of "careerism and political
irreponsibility" have to do with an assessment of a poet's work.

if seamus weren't famous, what would a charge of "careerism" mean?
and what does "political irresponsibility" mean if some folks think heaney
has consistently been addressing the political divisions in ireland? well, it
could mean that politics are partisan and subjective and that
irresponsibility is a charge brought by someone who doesn't agree with
another's  politics. Heaney: irreponsible? What is a poet supposed to be
responsible to, but himself. Perhaps he can only be judged by the
standards he has set for himself.

Suppose Heaney were not careerist, simply worked say for the BBC
editing news footage in Belfast (lilke paul muldoon did for 10 years till,
presumably, his "gratuitious" status as foreign poet  got him a job at
Princeton...look out now paul!), and was politically responsible in his
work (oh, let's say he said goodbye to English like Michael Hartnett and
wrote only in Irish, or wrote poems listing the war dead or made an
impassioned plea in verse to Gerry Adams to have assasinated the
violent faction of his IRA), would that make him a better poet?

Suppose he did not have  such a good ear and an eye for the imagery
rooted in the soil he writes about, and one could prove that careerism
and political irresponsibility were the causes, now then you'd have an
argument.


I do think that It is interesting and relevant to look at poetry as a possible
language site where political and historical issues work themselves out
(other issues work themselves out there too, like notions of self); but I
would argue that poetry as a political act, as in a public act, is not
possible today. Poetry has been disarmed, and to judge poets on this
basis (and the careerism is also a political charge, really) is
wrong-headed.


Of course there are plenty of examples of poets who have made
different career choices that didn't bring them to oxford or harvard or a
nobel or even a teaching job, and some of these were no doubt
consciouis choices. And examples there are too of poets who have
made a difference in individual's lives by impacting they way they
thought about politics. But that is such a small part of the impact of poetry
that I hate to see those criteria bandied forth with such immense weight,
when really the most enduring and interestingn poets are those who are
writing because they are enthusiasts of the word and the poetic forms,
the politics being incidental.

And those poets who are there primarily because they have chosen
poetry as a place to make political arguments, well, it shows.


by the way, david: of the heany i have read, i'd say he is most
uninteresting when trying to be political, such as him poem about going
through the checkpoint and how that is what writing is for him; or when
he compared his father's plougshare with his pencil; and the bog poems,
finding his ireland in Scandinavian soil.

better heaney describing  water gouting from a well  pump or the sound
of a woman singing in a stone kitchen.

maria, yep, certainly there are folks who want to teach comp. strictly on
this basis (i.e., bread & butter)... this is one basis for the argument
about rhet/comp suiting the powers that be (most generally from a specific
group of marxist scholars)...

i don't think it has to be this way... and i think dodie's experiences
indicate how vexed the issues can be... the entire debate about 'standard
english' (which many comp. teachers oppose) highlights why we need a better
and broader public understanding of what higher ed. is all about... and i'd
hate to think that it's all about more normalizing practices, even though
it can often seem this way...

could you expand on this just a bit??  i mself find it almost impossible
to see any language act as apolitical...  & its always that kind of
shortcoming in myself that benefits frm challange.  are you saying that
poetry is not a tactically efficent way of affecting political change?
or something else?  of course, if it's a shades-of-grey problem of how
much weight to give to political content when e-valuating work, thats
something different; and especially different from considering th formal
significance of a poem's language in terms political...

sorry to take just 2 lines so out of context, the th absoluteness of
"is not possible" struck me strongly, and close to my own concerns.

sincere

Subject:      Poesis & Politics

I must say, I'm very intrigued with the recent discussion of poetry as
political or not.  It seems to me that there are many poets who pick
up on the surrealist influence of an interest in language and poetic
form themselvs as political issues.  These conventions constitute our
notions of identity, so it seems to me that perhaps the ultimate
location for a liberation of identity (i.e. a political revolution at
the ontological level) is within the realm of linguistic and formal
play.  Here, language and social order confront and implicate one
another.  Poetry is hardly robbed of its social influence -- if we
choose to look at poetry in a somewhat more "poetic>" sense (as I
think most of this list does), then we can derfinitely see how forms
of comjmunication influence notions of identity and agency.  Just a
thought, and please excuse my typo's -- my modem is a bit stupid.

Subject:      suicide and narcissism

Of course lots of suicides have elements of narcissism in them (the "they'll
be sorry they treated me badly" syndrome), but is this always the case?  Is
it narcissistic to believe that one person can make a difference (and by the
way, the one person happens in this case to be...oneself)?

As for Gandhi, he did go on hunger strikes, which certainly carried the
threat of suicide.  He seems to have gotten what he wanted that way, too,
for a time.

I had an article on John Darnielle (who pretty much IS The Mountain Goats)
from a recent s.f. free alternative weekly lying around somewhere, but I
must have already mailed it to someone, 'cause I can't find it.  And
unfortunately I have no memory of much that it said about him.

When I saw him play an in-store show at the new location of Aquarius Records
recently, his throat was sort of scratchy but it didn't detract from his
charm.  He definitely IS literary (he introduced one song by saying, "This
next one wins the award for Most Pretentious Song Title of the Year:  it's
called "Song for the Julian Calendar") but his singing and playing are, to
me anyway, dead earnest which (again, to me) blows any possible pretention
out of consideration.  He was accompanied on a few songs by Australian
violinist (also guitarist) Alistair Galbraith.  Their collaborations were
ragged but delicate and haunting.

Oh, I did remember one Darnielle quote.  Because his albums are recorded on
four-track machines and such, he's often labelled as part of the
"lo-fi"movement, and the implied reduction of music to its recording medium
irritates him, because after all, he says, "you wouldn't ask a writer if
he's part of a 20-pound bond movement."

Your intrepid lil Rhody motormouth attended excellent reading here
yesterday, down at the Cable Car, the quaint cinema lounge with the
spongy loveseats.  Mark McMorris (say that 20 times with pebbles in
yr motor) & Joshua Saul Beckman, 2 very fine poets, leaned on the tv
set (fortunately turned off) & read for about 40 mins each.  McMorris
is a subtle & strong writer, the refined sound/vocab & swift flow of
images made me think of Montale a little (the mention of :"Genoa" in
_Moth Wings_ keyed me onto it - am I on the right track?).  Joshua
Beckman, remarkably original writer, something between prose/poetry/
performance art/storytelling, wonderful surrealism with a lot of
thought, heart, Whitman-kindness-compassion.  Very funny too.  His
paragraphs on the joy of being an adult especially etc.  Beckman
publishes "Object Lesson" a serial of unique conceptions. Providence
is brimming with poesis up to its ear-canals (the revamp of downtown
makes it look like St. Petersburg or Venice too).

Subject:      a librarian on libraries--and librarians

All--

What follows is the posting of a librarian who's very critical of a
certain
drift in libraries and in his profession. He takes his interlocutors on
the
autocat newsgroup to task for their knee-jerk reactions to Nicholson
Baker's
"The Author vs. the Library" in the October 14 New Yorker.

--James Brook

P.S. to Ron Silliman: In Cathy Simon's article in Representations 42 ("A
Civic Library
for San Francisco") I find this quotation: "The function of a library is
elemental:
it is the house of the book, a building used to store and conserve
books. It is a
promoter of books, words, and literacy." I wish she had adhered to this
elemental
building program--the San Francisco New Main is an antibook environment.
There's
no room for the existing collection, no room to store books for
reshelving, no
room for expansion, no UV glass in the skylights, human circulation
within the
building is difficult, there's not enough room for the patrons. . . .
But there's
plenty of room for the Bank of America, the Gap & Co. As well as a gift
shop and
a cafe. Cathy Simon may be a good or even great architect in other
respects, but
the New Main doesn't work as a library, as eloquent and detailed
testimony from
some two dozen pages at a recent Library Commission meeting reaffirmed.

From:         Joseph Blackburn <hlcat@ttacs.ttu.edu>
To:           AUTOCAT (automation catalogers) newsgroup

I sincerely hope that those of you who are so eagerly preparing
rebuttals to Nicholson Baker's latest New Yorker article will kindly
refrain from claiming to speak for librarians as a group or
librarianship as a profession.  You will likely not be speaking for
those SFPL librarians who have made Baker their spokesman, nor, most
likely, will you speak for me.

I would also kindly request that you not, speaking as a librarian,
condemn Mr. Baker for statements he did not make.  Mr. Baker is not
opposed to weeding, for on p. 52 of the New Yorker he speaks well of the
practice and provides a definition that would do a library school
student proud.  What he opposes, among other things, is the way weeding
was done at SFPL. Indeed, he criticizes City Librarian Dowlin for not
adhering to Dowlin's own stated theory of weeding.  If the recent weeds
of the SFPL collection were anything like what Mr. Baker has described,
then, in my opinion, a serious injustice has been done against our
profession as well as against the people of San Francisco.

Do not then embarrass yourself by claiming that Mr. Baker is too
ignorant understand the necessity of weeding.  Do not claim that he is
incapable of judging whether or not a book has value.  (He does not
claim, as was supposed in an AUTOCAT post, that all old books are
valuable just because they are old, nor does he likely believe, as was
also posted, that SFPL should retain an old phone book because he once
underlined a number in it. He provides numerous examples of books that
may safely be withdrawn.)  Do not claim that he would forbid you to
discard moldly lettuce from your own refrigerator, as was said as well,
and stunningly, on AUTOCAT.  (What he would forbid you to do is to allow
a book placed in your care to mold and then to be discarded without any
attempt to ascertain its value or uniqueness.)

When Mr. Baker's appreciation of card catalogs was published, it was
implied by some AUTOCATs that Baker must be too thick to handle an one
of our state-of-the-art online catalogs.  He later proved on this very
forum that he not only knew how to use the University of California's
system, he knew its strengths and weaknesses better that many of his
critics. Beware his sting.

And since I've mentioned card catalogs, it should perhaps be noted here,
as I cannot recall seeing it mentioned elsewhere, that Mr. Baker
provides a very good reason for not discarding SFPL's card catalog in
favor of exclusive reliance on the online system, viz, that the online
catalog apparently does not include all of the books!  What's the next
step, using the lack of a card catalog as an excuse to trash any book
not in the online catalog?

I would also suggest that you not imply that Mr. Baker's vision of
libraries and librarians is not a valid one merely because it is at
variance with your own vision.  That you may or may not have majority
support is irrelevant.

I know that Mr. Baker loves libraries, and I believe that he loves
librarians.  He at least loves what he thinks we are.  I think that he
believes that librarians are the preservers and promoters of the
cultural, intellectual, and social history of humanity.  When he
encounters a library which "has built into it a contempt for, or at
least an indifference to, literary culture and its requirements" (p.
59), he wants to scream out a warning, to us as well as to the public.
When he encounters a librarian built in a similar fashion, his instincts
are the same.  Personally, I think it unfortunate that librarianship is
not what he thinks it is.  I certainly remember my own shock at
discovering that librarianship was a job, not a calling, and that
librarians as a group were no more likely to be devoted to "literary
culture and its requirements" than were the members of any other
profession.  But still, I am here.

San Francisco City Librarian Dowlin's philosophy is probably, just as
Nicholson Baker fears, the current ruling philosophy of our profession.
It is certainly a valid point-of-view, more especially so in a time when
the public in general seems to have no interest whatsoever in funding
a commitment to comprehensive research collections.  Still, I think it
sad that our (if I may be so bold, Mr. Baker) vision of what a great
city library should be must not only be superseded, it must be
physically destroyed.  Perhaps that is, in its own way, a testament to
the power of our ideas and our ideals.

for those of you who don't know michael eldridge (the only person on that panel

revolution of the word, with amitava kumar and some others i don't know talking
about slams, populist poetics etc.  ben friedlander is talking about levinas on
the jewish cultural studies panel. i notice lisa s, charles b and barrett w are

Conference: Cross-Cultural Poetics
Dates: October 16-19, 1997

The conference described below will be part of a series of events including
readings and performances by local and national poets, ethnographers,
storytellers and community cultural workers.

Despite artificial disciplinary barriers, ethnographers & poets have in recent
years come to realize how similar their projects are.  Cross-Cultural Poetics
seeks to address the increasingly untenable boundaries between poetic &
ethnographic practices.  The conference will focus on the role of poetry in the
on-going discourses of multiculturalism, ethnography, and literary theory and
practice.  While recent years have seen a debate in "how culture is written
(about)" and most of these debates make extensive use of the term "poetics,"
poetic discourse itself has not been foregrounded as a significant measure and
critique-mechanism in the matrix of cultural writings.  Construing the term
"poetry" fairly broadly, we invite poets and scholars working in a broad range
of fields -- anthropology, urban studies, ethnic studies, folklore, literature
and literary theory, sociology, history, publishing, film, American studies,
performance studies, ethnomusicology, cultural studies, etc. -- to propose
readings, papers or panels that address one or more of the following areas:

- Comparative Poetries &/or Poetic Traditions
- Oral/Literate Interfaces or Standoffs
- Anthropological Methodologies Applied to Poetic Texts, Communities, Events, or
Individual Poems or Poets
- Ethnography as Poetry/Poetry as Ethnography
- Ethnic, Folkloric & Vernacular Poetries
- Poetry as Cultural & Social Praxis
- Poetry as Cultural & Social Critique
- Constituting Communities through Poetic Activity
- Poetry as Mass Culture
- Poetry & the Public Sphere
- The Anthropology of Writing & the Writing of Anthropology
- Representing Self/Other: poetic "Auto-ethnographies"?
- Issues in Cultural Translation
- "Ethnopoetics": Reappraisals?
- Poetry & Other Media (Song Lyrics, Music, Film, Movement, Visual      Arts, etc.)
- Close Readings of &/or Listenings to Ethnographic Documents
- The Poetics of Thick Description
- Ritual, Play, etc. as Elements in Poetic Composition
- The Act of Inscription: Fieldnotes, Notebooks, etc.
- The Cultural Migration of Texts
- Hybridization of Genres & Traditions

PAPERS, WRITING SAMPLES (FOR POETS WANTING TO READ) AND PANEL PROPOSALS (a
1-2-page abstract) should be sent by March 15, 1997 to Maria Damon, English
Dept., 207 Lind Hall, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis MN  55455.

Loss and others,

I notice that the Digital Poetics panel, of which we're both a
part, is scheduled at the same time as Lisa's L(R)J session. So
much for the amount of MLA bandwith allotted to "alternatives."

(Actually, I know that the timing wasn't deliberate, but it's
still frustrating since I suspect the two panels will have
audiences in common.)

Some recent good press re the Electronic Poetry Center (EPC)
So look at:
-- PMLA p. 988 (Sept. 1996)
-- current issue of Poets & Writers (Nov./Dec. 1996)
-- Yahoo: Internet Life (Dec. 1996 issue I believe - a review - let me know
if you see this)
-- Chronicle of Higher Ed. (we're supposed to be featured Internet resource
next week I think) + an article on Creeleyfest in that issue

It's also incoherent and ugly; it would not be difficult to deconstruct
"man," "action," "perfect," "type," here. I only wonder what the context
is, and whether it's redemptive.

interesting point, these are all words nietzsche used to great sardonic,

like that? it brought my system to its knees and i had to throw it out w/out
ever knowing what it was (couldn't open it) or who it was from, whether it was a
goodfaith-but-too-long message my machine couldn't handle, or a malevolent blitz

This raises good questions.  I posted the WCW quote not as an oracular
statement from on high, but because i had just read it right before i
read Patrick Pritchett's post on the Change incident, and because it
seemed to belong in dialogue with Pritchett's comments (i wasn't trying
to get a touche(') or "ouch" response).  The context in DW is not
immediately clear, and since i was only skimming thru i'm not prepared
to make a holistic reading.  I'm not really sure how WCW wanted it to
be read.  Quite possible, for ex., that it *cld* be meant as a critique
of the "man of action."  Don't know right now what a more thorough
reading of DW wld yield.  I'm not sure either what i ultimately think
about the dynamics of martyrdom, but i will say i think "narcissism" is
too reductive a label.  This is all provisional and wishy-washy as hell,
i know, but that's what i use this medium for.  steve

You may be interested--who knows?--in discovering that there's a
"Situationist International Archive" at

http://www.nothingness.org/SI

Many situationist and pre-situationist texts can be found there in
English and in French. There are also some press clippings, notably
those relating to Guy Debord's death. Also related to Guy Debord's
death--and life--is a poem of mine, "Stanzas on the Death of Guy
Debord," which the curious can dig out with a click on

Colby 20, Zedd 3 (65) at Poetry City, 7 p.m. 10/24.

Time: C (25 mins), Z (33 mins)
Attendance: 25

Spoken-word diva Todd Colby and sardonic red-head Nick Zedd read work at
Poetry City last Thursday. Colby, a part-time rock star whose animated
delivery included waving his hands and his head from side to side, kept a
consistent one laugh-to-poem ratio over a set of twenty poems, garnering
four rounds of applause for what he referred to as 'my crazy poems'
("Twins", "Big Boy", "Hot Pig" and "Bull By the Horns"). New Yorkers fondly
remember Colby as the fair-haired one who got Books and Co to stock
contemporary poetry down among the fiction, and there were references to a
certain landscape of poetry throughout his work, which tends toward the
user-hostile surreal ("angels driving forklifts across meats", "where
angels have migraines", "the tiger who became butter", "meat is glamorous",
"Metal Sweats Mahogany Dogs"). Colby removed his sweater early on,
performing in a light blue short sleeve shirt, silver watch, blue jeans,
and brown shoes.

There was a brief intermission, and then Anna Malmude introduced Nick Zedd.
Filmmaker Zedd, author of _Bleed Part One_ (Hanuman, come back!), read
three chapters of a new prose work, apparently an autobiographical novel.
The narrative as it stood consisted of episodes in bars, cabs, beds and
grocery stores. Zedd clocked an amazing 65 laughs. Much of the Zedd-effect
comes from the apparent contradictions -- dyed-red hair, surly expression,
brusque affect, clear prose, and a nasty-but-sweet sense of humor. Like a
punk version of Saturday Night Live's Norm MacDonald, or an unsaleable
Sandra Bernhard, Zedd records the total obvious stupidity of one kind of
everyday life in New York. Some lines: "I've tried screwing girls in
toilets before and it always feels desperate", "Isabel insisted on laughing
at me at precise intervals", "Harrisburg, PA, where he'd been publishing a
fanzine called NO FUTURE for the last five years", "'This is an Olympic
Condom,' I announced", and "'It's turkey bacon, you fucked up!' 'If you
want, I can go back and get bacon with fat on it.'" Zedd performed in a
dark blue paramilitary jacket, black jeans, and pointy black boots. He
delivered his prose looking down at the lectern, occasionally pausing (at
odd moments) to look up at the audience. The reading concluded shortly
after Zedd recounted walking out on a recent poetry reading.

In the audience were regulars Dug Rothschild, Karl Parker, Steve Malmude
and Anselm Berrigan, and visiting poets Seph Rodney and Brenda Coultas.

          Hi here, I've been muddling my way towards this post on
sensitivities for a couple of days now  -  (feeling it coming on from some
way out).

          Something difficult to disentangle happened on Friday night at a
Literature Live event I was curating, had announced on this list in fact,
that has some bearing on both the discussions of 'so-called experimental'
and 'so-called mainstream' (i like those inflections Keith) writing
practices, as well as on the lines about ecleticism in musical
appreciations, especially re 'pop'. (I also enjoyed Rob Hardin and Steve
Carl's rangey admonishments to listen beyond or in spite of, or wilful
disregard for, category). I bore such recent discussion in mind, during the
events unravelling here and in their gradual settlements into the
continuities of these past days. The word 'sensitive' cuts unto almost
every aspect of this post.

          There were 350 young, for the most part drunk and / or pilled- up
(not absolutely all), people at Colchester Arts Centre (sacked by
Boudicca's Iceni and Britain's oldest, and oldest garrison, town) last
Friday night for The Night of The Living Tongues.

          A capacity audience was in before 10.30 and many others were
locked out. (no major statement intended)

          They had already experienced a nest (nay, almost a thicket) of
car speakers (wired onto a sawn-off hatstand free-standing in a white
marble font) whispering rhythmic wickedly mis-treated language fragments,
interfacing with a video of rushes (from the Halvergate Marshes on the
Broads) going in and out of focus, projected onto a giant screen forming
this 'horizontal rushes' gateway into the deconsecrated church. A foyer
installation intended as an exquisite interference in the entrance to a
space through which a steady passage of audience (all being thoroughly
searched due to a drugs bust at the same venue in the summer  -  once the
police get their teeth into it's a little like being hounded for years by
the tax department) passed. Slowed bird-song and voices, dreaming "it's a
kind of memory   -  i car-ry with me". (installation by Sianed Jones and
Martin Sercombe)

          I'm seeing a tall bearded young man, in a dark overcoat, with
long frizzy hair (very retro hippy with tendencies towards convoy  -  you
know, the battered steel cap partly laced boots) dancing into and onto the
open floor, staring down into the drum n bass spinning lights on the
parquet, sniffing out the vibe.

          Josefina Cupido played a twnety minute set, under a quiet siege
of 'get-offs' from a 'party' group close by her stage. There were two
stages. A lot of people present however listened respectfully and yet
quietly chatted  -  about the space (which Orphan Drift, check their fine
first novel, had spent the whole day carefully transforming), about her
presence as a woman-percussionist / vocalist. Singing out:

Of my potentiality
Hay hay hay hay
Our scentences deconstruct form
Scaffolding and hair upon rocks
The words never quite leaving me


And in the ring of love
We fight with falling in love
With love being in love
With love falling in love with love
Is an addiction

(from her debut CD launched by us last night in The Vortex, north London,
to a packed house  -  very much hometown crowd  - alongside Annie
Whitehead's 'Rude' w/ the incomparable Harry Beckett, the CD released on
Sound & Language as 'One Woman One Drum'  -  orders taken  -  that's the
only add here)

          One of the DJs from Asian Dub Foundation drifted onto a drum and
bass groove (jungle, pop pickers, or bungle as the Asian wags have it).
Very jazzy programming. Ronnie Fraser-Monro did some laconic readings of
re-written Oasis lyrics, deliberately twisted before introducing Aaron
Williamson (one of the most dynamic performance poets on these islands,
profoundly deaf and utterly articulated in every syllable and gesture). "Go
on my son!" yelled out one Essex man as Aaron launched on:

"I don't eat meat I AM meat"
- my own carcass
"you mean sarcophagus"
... contracting,
colliding ...
"and the division between flesh
and celestial"
we term 'thinking'
is confessed down
intentions
in fact run down
or thisappeared
in inking

(from Cathedral Lung)  -  his mike stand toppling onto a young woman
perched almost at his feet, she's yelling "come outside now you, let's sort
this out!"  -  of course he's deaf and is close to lost in his performance
(another guy stood right next to him and spoke directly to him before
wandering off bemused as Aaron continued regardless).
           This was an extraordinarily engaging scene all in all. A
carnival of sensitivities. Some people were genuinely shocked or downright
disturbed by Aaron's intensity, others ravished by his compassionate
engagement with the dark ironic humour that he rings from his hearing
impairment. But nothing 'heroic' was going on other than him working to
keep his work out there, alive in a brutalising world of near indifference.


          The edgiest context for 'poetics' that I can remember having
experienced for a long time.

          During the transitions from Aaron (leaving the stage drenched in
sweat and exhausted) into the first part of a blistering live set from
Asian Dub Foundation, a wave of awkwardness resolved itself into joyful
dancing engagements throughout the crowd as what the here ? erupted into a
sonic architecture of my own three stooges, namely melody, rhythm and
noise. That passage of time was, for me, poetry. The sensitivities it
examined offered both dystopian and utopian visions of accessibility.

          ADF were pursued by Ronnie, doing a scurrilous impression of the
hunching, aged Dame Barbara Tartland reading selections from her own work
against odd disco muzak. I had to break up a fight at the bar, a punter
tried to nut Martin Sercombe, the police were called to prevent a
late-comer (already bleeding at the mouth from bashing nimself against the
doors) from assaulting those who began to leave about 1am.

          One further aspect is worth mentioning, that being Orpan Drift's
performance being spoilt by a tech nerd (sound familiar?). Said nerd in
question refused to work with what them because they were using an
'unprofessional' piece of equipment. By the time we could deal with him the
moment had passed and a baying crowd needed appeasement for their rushing
energies.

Be curious to hear stories of performances (readings even) becoming victim
to techno nightmares in this space.

love and love

David Shapiro 15, Brenda Coultas 11, John Godfrey 10
at the Ichor Reading Series at Clementine Gallery, 526 E 26th St, NYC
Friday, October 25, 8:30 p.m.

Attendance: 65

Sam Truitt's Ichor Reading Series opened its second season Friday night at
the brand-new Clementine Gallery. Reading first was David Shapiro. Shapiro
read the following poems:

        Light Bulb, 1960
        The Poem with a Footnote
        Voiceless
        For Mikhail Govrin
        Song of the Eiffel Tower
        The Lost Golf Ball
        A Found Golf Ball
        Bambino e Deo (?)
        Old Poems
        The Boss Poem (w/ Daniel Shapiro)
        Black Silk (by Daniel Shapiro)
        Poem that Doesn't Belong (by Daniel Shapiro)
        The Snow Is Alive (w/ Daniel Shapiro)
        Falling Upwards
        To the Earth

It was a strong set for Shapiro, whose interpoem comments were at a pretty
high level, and whose poems were as beautiful as ever. New motifs in
Shapiro's work (or new manifestations of old motifs) seem to have much to
do with his intense and continual invocation of the late poet Joseph
Ceravolo -- the Ceravolesque influence found not just in lines like "I was
scared/into/again" but in "an ordinary goose goes squawking across the
parking lot" and "there is no day off for a bug in a forest". Shapiro read
uncharacteristically slowly, adjusting for the so-so acoustics in the
space, which is a fairly typical Chelsea gallery with tall walls and a
shoebox shape. Shapiro apologized for his poems about physics (the golf
ball poems), noting that he did not do well in physics in high school, and
that he used to torment his teachers by asking them 'What is light?'
Shapiro read in a black shirt and a black jacket.

Brenda Coultas read eleven pieces (I think) without an intermission.
Coultas, author of _Early Films_ (Rodent), read the following pieces
quietly:

        The Rise of Sex Towards God
        Dream Life and the Kiss of Transvestitism
        Blue Line
        Now or If You Were a Person
        Preamble
        Preamble
        Salt God (or Salt Block?)
        ??
        My Manifesto
        Capitalist Projections
        Oya

Some lines from Brenda's work: "I trusted you of catness", "It's no femur,
just a vertebrae", "'I could make a great movie' 'So take off your
clothes'", "I'm in America wearing a boutonniere of gigantic proportions",
"I'm God's spokesmodel let me in", "There are sixteen types of hymens and I
have thirteen of them", "This is a love story between fingers", "He has
danced for subway tokens, meatballs and joy but he has never worn a
g-string", and "All of us were very very late". Brenda Coultas will be
reading at Poetry City on December 5 with Ange Mlinko.

There was an intermission before John Godfrey began. In the audience were:
Eleni Sikelianos, Laird Hunt, Anselm Berrigan, Rudy Burckhardt, Yvonne
Jacquette, Simon Pettet, Steve Malmude, Drew Gardner, Anna Malmude, Bill
Kushner, Barbara Henning, Carol Malmude Szamatowicz, Lisa Jarnot, Lewis
Warsh, Heather Ramsdell, Garrett Kalleberg, Sean Killian, Chris
Stroffolino, Bill Luoma, Marcella Harb, Prageeta Sharma, Star Black,
Gregory Botts, and I think Steve Katz. Lee Ann Brown was videotaping.

John Godfrey closed the evening by reading the following poems:

        Evil Tunnels
        Gray Pants
        Feminine Stamp
        Who Walk
        Kinds of Smoke
        The Slightest Foam
        The History of Blows
        To Keep Saliva Warm
        Day Goo
        The Ticket

Godfrey, who is a nurse for pediatric AIDS patients, read
uncharacteristcally slowly to adjust to the space. Slowed down, his prose
poems revealed narratives in among the accumulated details, observations
and instructions, which were pretty concise. "Do not saddle up the hound",
"Flesh is so organized it takes this mess to heart and relaxes", "Pleasure
... to sacrifice the present for the present", "Teeth turning red by the
light of cartoons", "All it takes is the crepuscule for me to drown in
longing", "My law is, exceptions never cease", "A fabulous white rat behind
every wall", "Land has no purpose but to support us to walk", "Well I am
male after all", "The fundamental unit of her kind is the jiffy", "Frowzy
shroud". Hearing Godfrey read slowly, I remembered how much of a help it
was to my silent reading of David Shapiro to hear Shapiro perform his
poems. One adjusts one's expectations for meaning. With these three
readers, the adjustments were sexy, calming and clarifying.

        A friend years ago told me, "there's the spontaneous suicide--and
the suicide who studies up for it".

        An example of the latter may be found in Mayakovsky's How Are
Verses Made--in Mayakovsky's extended commentary on a poem by and the
suicide of Esenin.

Subject:      There was a reading in Providence? What about Brown?

So Henry:

If Providence has become such a poetic hotbedlambadactylic zone,
then what's your take on Brown U's literary activities? I participated
in the Unspeakable Practices Festival in 92 and was very pleased with
Robert Coover, Eurydice et al. Coover actually taught my essay, Definitions
for the Dungeon, as well as my short story, When Sleep Comes Down, to
his graduate class--and this was when my writing was *completely*
unknown. He also brought Samuel Delaney there--a neglected
great writer, in my opinion. C. visited our guest rooms in
the morning. He and Eurydice actually threw a party in my bedroom,
which was thoughtful (or amusingly thoughtless), to say the least.
I was also glad that Coover cared so much about creating a
place where peers could meet and interact--an opportunity,
Coover remarked, that he himself never had.

When I heard they were going to the UP Festival this year, I told my
friends--known writers who shall remain nameless--that they'd have a
blast. Apparently, I was as wrong as the Belgian accountant who insisted
he could subsist on his own urine. (He died after less than a week.)

This year, my NYC mates went to Brown and came back disgusted
with the event and with the new writing faculty (whoever they are:
don't know them). I was shocked to hear about this--particularly since
Hawkes was the Dean of Lit before Coover, and both Hawkes and Coover are
brilliant stylists and excellent teachers. There was talk of a wretched
instructor: I'm told she railed at anyone who had ever been published
in the New Yorker (as if an academic position is somehow less status quo
than a magazine gig) and generally made everyone feel unlistened to
and unwelcome.

Does anyone know anything about this? How could one of the most interesting
and progressive writing programs in the country have purportedly gone sour
so rapidly? Or did the place really change that much at all? The instructor
my friends are dissing was doubtless chosen by Coover--could she really be
so bad?

I liked Coover's writing and enthusiasm a lot. I liked the climate he created
at Brown as well. I have good friends who come from that version of Brown.
I like lots of things about their lib arts background, including their
politics.

Are my NYC writer-friends mistaken? Tell me this isn't true.

All the best,

Rob Hardin

Sorry for cross-posting.

I picked up a few copies of the French electronic literature journal ALIRE in
Geneva yesterday that I thought might be of interest to list.  Each edition
includes work in both PC and Mac format.

ALIRE no 7 (April 1994) includes work by Philippe Bootz, Jean-Marie Dutey,
Disztichon Alfa and Philippe Castellin.

ALIRE no 8 (November 1994) includes work by Patrick Burgaud, Jean-Marie
Lafaille, Pedro Barbosa, Albilio Cavalheiro, Jacques Donguy, Guillaume
Loizillon, Jean-Pierre Balpe and Eduardo Kac.

ALIRE no 9 (June 1995) includes work by Jean-Marie Dutey, Phillipe Bootz, Claude
Maillard and Tibor Papp.

Their address is:       Mots-Voir
                        27, allee des Coquelicots
                        F-59650 Villeneuve d'Ascq
                        France

They also published essays in French and English in 1994 from the colloquium
"A:\LITERATURE; colloque Nord Poesie et Ordinateur" held at the Universite de
Lille 3.

next June), so I was thinking about some of the remarks on poetries &
performances when I went to hear Oliver Lake's 'The Matador of 1st and 1st'
at the local jazz club last night.

Lake describes the 70 minute performance as 'a poetic monologue,
incorporating jazz, rap, improvised live and prerecorded musical accents' &
as 'a piece of performance art.' Well, it is all of that, but how 'hear' a
lot of what he said, chanted, sang, as poetry? The 'rap' piece was funny,
at least semi-satirizing of commercial rap, also very pointedly an attack
on consumerism (there were others). Lake continually changed costumes, as
he took on different personae. The title piece was in heavily metric
rhyming verse. Other parts were more straight spoken riffs, there were also
moments of high lyric intensity, chants of fairly straightforward calls to
love, be equal, etc. At one point he talked about all the different kinds
of music, how certain players were all good, & insisted, 'labels separate.'
Kept coming back to what he seemed to be 'arguing' was a false opposition
between oral/literary. Had a funny rap on 'organic lady', light, funny, but
not making fun (a delicate balance that). A lot of what he was presenting
was meant, I think, to be heard as poetry, & it was essentially
traditionally lyric, but with intereting narrative breaks (out). In between
all of these he played, alto, soprano, flute. Ranging from the furthest out
howls & hoots to the deepest in melodies of claritas. Toward the end,
mentioning some soft r & b of the 70s, he then did choose jazz in a way:
        thank god for
                duke ellington
        music was
                   is/his
        (our)
                mistress
or at least that was how I heard it.

The audience, most of whom I'd bet dont read poetry, loved it, loved him.
Laughed in the right places, applauded both phrases that caught their
attention & solos that tore the place up.

So: what was it? I cant say but can say that if Oliver Lake brings this
solo piece to your neighbourhood, I highly recommend it, as such.

All the best

Thanks for the updates, Maria and Loss.  I will check out yr web page.

Speaking of MLA, I will be chairing/moderating a panel I put together on the
later work of the Irish poet Thomas Kinsella.  I think the papers will be
pretty good, and Kinsella doesn't get much attention, tho he's the older
Irish poet who has learned the most from modernism.  Inexplicably, the panel
is in a huge room.  So come on down; there's room for everybody.

Cheers,
David

CALL FOR PAPERS

Please post hardcopies in addition to posting and forwarding
electronically to interested parties.

The Department of English at Rutgers University, New Brunswick
announces POETRY AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE:  A CONFERENCE
ON CONTEMPORARY POETRY, APRIL 24-27, 1997

Scheduled to participate:  ADRIENNE RICH, ROBERT HASS, SONIA
SANCHEZ, MIGUEL ALGARIN, POETS FROM THE NUYORICAN
POETS' CAFE, CHARLES BERNSTEIN, TRICIA ROSE, CHARLES
ALTIERI, MARIA DAMON, ALICIA OSTRIKER, CHERYL
CLARKE, CORA KAPLAN, RACHEL HADAS, MICHAEL MCKEON,
ELIN DIAMOND, ABENA BUSIA, SUSAN STANFORD FRIEDMAN
and many others.

This interdisciplinary conference is open to the public and aims to
provide new understandings of poetry's participation in the public
sphere.   The last two decades have witnessed a resurgence of interest
in public poetry--readings, festivals, performances, films, television
series, and poetry slams.  In examining the way poetry affects and is
affected by social context, we will consider a range of contemporary
poetries in their public settings, including performance-oriented,
community-based, socially engaged, and formally experimental work.
Questions of audience and aesthetics will be central to our discussion
of poetry's active role in building, defining, questioning, and
motivating social and political communities.  Designed to bring a broad range
of people from inside and outside the academy into conversation, the conference
will feature roundtable discussions, poetry readings and performances, keynote
lectures, and panel presentations by a wide range of poets, scholars, and
activists.

We welcome submissions from anyone with an interest in poetry.  We
are currently accepting:

1.  Detailed two-page proposals for 15-minute papers, not limited to the
topics listed here.  (Feel free to suggest panel topics; however, we are
not accepting group panel proposals.)

2.  Detailed proposals for roundtable discussions (no more than four
people), to consist of five-minute remarks and a moderated discussion.
You may provide participant names  and brief profiles of chair and
three to four panelists, plus a two-page proposal describing the topic,
approach, and intended contribution of each discussant.  You may propose an
entire roundtable or may outline your contribution and suggest roundtables for
which it might be relevant.

Here are some possible topics for discussion:

  poetry and social movements   poetics of performance poetry
  politics of form              poetry and public sphere theory
  poetry as witness             poetry and community activism
  African American poetry            poetry slams
  poetry and popular culture    global poetry
  Latino/a poetry               poetry and identity politics

     If you would like to be on our mailing list, please send an email
message to Kathy Crown (kcrown@rci.rutgers.edu) or Nick Yasinski
(yasinski@rci.rutgers.edu), or write Harriet Davidson at the address above.
Indicate whether you have a place to put a conference poster or need only a
registration form (saving us a little money).  Registration forms will be sent
by snail mail early next year, so please include your snail address as well as
your email address.

LOCATION

     The conference will take place on the campus of Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, NJ, which is an easy 50-minute train or
car ride from New York City (1 1/2 hr from Philadelphia by car, 2 hr
by local trains; 25-min by car from Newark Int'l Airport; 30-min by
train or car from Princeton).

SCHEDULE OF EVENTS (to be confirmed in early 1997)

The conference will begin mid-afternoon on Thursday, April 24 with
some of its most exciting and importance featured events, including
panels and roundtables with important poets and scholars, as well as
an evening reading by nationally known poets from the Nuyorican
Poets Cafe, organized by Miguel Algarin (names available soon, upon
final agreement).  We strongly encourage people to come for the
Thursday afternoon and evening events.  Friday and Saturday, April
25 & 26, will include a variety of panels, roundtables, mid-day
readings, and evening readings by Adrienne Rich (and others) on
Friday and Robert Hass and probably Sonia Sanchez (and others) on
Saturday.  The conference will conclude on Sunday, April 27, with
panels and a featured roundtable and discussion summing up the
conference, ending by early afternoon.

REGISTRATION

     The conference is open to the public.  However, people should
be advised that we may be obliged to give priority seating at some
events such as the featured evening readings to people who have
registered.  Registration fees have yet to be set but will probably rely
on a sliding scale.  Registration announcements/forms will go out in
early Spring, 1997.   Anyone submitting a proposal for the conference
will automatically be sent a registration form  (accepted proposals do
not exempt one from registration fees).  Anyone who does not submit a
proposal can be sure to receive a registration form by writing to
Harriet Davidson, Associate Professor of English and Director of
Women's Studies, P.O. Box 5054, Rutgers University, New Brunswick,
NJ  08903-5054, or by sending an email request for a registration form
to Kathy Crown (kcrown@rci.rutgers.edu) or Nick Yasinski
(yasinski@rci.rutgers.edu).  Include your snail address; forms will be sent out
early next year.

ACCOMMODATIONS

     A special rate of $59/night for conference-goers has been
arranged for a limited number of rooms at the very nice, full-service
Holiday Inn in nearby Somerset (a 12-min car ride from Rutgers) near
Rte 287.  Please call (908) 356-1700 and make sure to mention the
conference name and Rutgers.  We are hoping to arrange at least one
reception at the Holiday Inn, as well as daily shuttles to and from the
conference; for these reasons, we encourage anyone staying overnight
to use the Holiday Inn if possible.  The only hotel within walking
distance of the conference is the Hyatt Hotel (908) 873-1234 in
downtown New Brunswick; it is significantly more expensive than the
Holiday Inn.
     The Holiday Inn deal provides nicer accommodations (and most
likely at a lower cost) than the "moderately priced" options below; the
"more expensive" options are sometimes double the Holiday Inn price
and usually do not have much more to recommend them.  Options
include the Quality Inn (908-469-5050) in Somerset, 10 min away,
moderately priced; the Ramada Inn (908-828-6900) in East Brunswick
near NJ Turnpike Exit 9, 8 min from Rutgers, moderately priced; the
Marriot Hotel (908-560-0500) in Somerset, 12 min away, more
expensive (within walking distance of the Holiday Inn); the Windham
Gardens (908-980-0400) in Piscataway, 8 min away, more expensive;
the Hilton (908-828-2000) in East Brunswick near NJ Turnpike Exit 9,
8 min from Rutgers, much more expensive (JFK airport shuttle stop).

Re: david kellogg's & michael coffey's discussion of heaney (gosh: what
just giving the title of a poem can generate): I'm glad to see it, & the
rest. I have not seen that booklet, & believe the library here doesnt have
it. can you give us publication data?

I tend to agree that, like content (as bpNichol used to say), it's there,
some unavoidable aspect of 'speaking,' or 'using language.' So it's what
seems to come through as present that becomes interesting. I think I would
agree with coffey that 'being political' is not heaney's forte, but I
suspect a lot of his readers appreciate precisely that aspect of his work.
I am intrigued about the 'whole series of agonized letters in the IRISH
TIMES defending Heaney.' That seems to speak, at least, to a readership, &
an engaged one, even if the terms of the engagement may not be those that
tend to be agreed upon in this list. A queer theorist & medievalist in our
department told me at a reading yesterday that he is a great heaney fan,
although he allowed that it's partly because his supervisor was one &
introduced him to the poet & the poetry (he added that he thinks heaney is
just a terrific performer). I mention this only to add that I dont know
exactly what it points to, This is a man who directs 'perverse' productions
of medieval drama, presents himself, in a province whose government remains
stolidly homophobic, as 'queer,' & whose general interest in contemporary
writing would tend to be in gay/lesbian/queer writing. What does _his_ love
of heaney mean? I dont know; but does anyone have any ideas? I must add
that I would rather read Muldoon, but even more, Boland, & if given the
further choice of just what I want, would be into North American writers,
including a lot of Canadians many here wont know (& I tend to read fairly
widely there, which is perhaps another thread: how, in smaller countries
with more recent literatures like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the
absolute conflict between various kinds of poetics doesnt happen quite so
obviously, & cross-overs work).

poetry--on Sunday at noon.  It's chaired by Susan Gilmore from Ithaca
College and should be a lot of fun.

Once upon a time there's this orator who discovers that his fellow
Athenians are in imminent, mortal danger. He harangues the citizens like a
tyrant, commanding them to act on his news -- but they ignore his
fanatic outburst. Then the orator tries a different tac. He invokes the
honourable dead, the war heroes etc, with a violent, impassioned rhetoric
of unity -- but to no avail. The idle itizens prefer to watch a couple of
kids scuffling in the dust. The orator tries one final time. He tells a
fable. Once upon a time, Ceres ('the earth fertility goddess') went
strolling with her good friends eel and swallow. They came to a river and
could walk no further. But the eel swam across, and the swallow flew....
"And what did Ceres do?" the citizens cried as one. "I'll tell you," said
the orator. "She transported herself...into a rage against all of you, for
listening to kids' fairy tales instead of to the news of imminent danger
to our fair city." From that point on the citizens were all ears for the
orator's news. Thus the power of fables.

essentializing paraphrase)

As one of the very few owners of a copy of Oliver Lake's book of poetry,
I've always thought he was a great saxophone player and composer --

but that performance piece sounds delicious -- was anything said about a
recording becoming available???

        Maria, Thanks for the announcement of your Cross-Cultural Poetics
conference in Minneapolis next October, which sounds like a much-needed
conversation and also lots of fun--I will plan to be there.  Nice to see a
conference about "poetics" that actually includes poets and talk about
poetry...  --Kathy

Subject:      politics & poetry

I hope this isn't a dead horse, and I'm sure that threads of this sort
have appeared before.  But I feel like spouting.  If you don't feel
like reading this, then please delete it.

I've been reading through Talisman 15, at the end of which is an
exchange between Perloff and Warsh on Oppen, politics, et. al.  In
addition, Leonard Schwartz rehashes, in a gentle manner, Eliot
Weinberger's claim that Language poets are Reagen-era capitalist dupes
because they unhinge words from history, just as Reagan did.

Perloff makes such statements as "The personal is the political."
Warsh agrees with both Perloff and Schwartz that poetry and politics
are somehow linked.

I assert:

1) POETRY IS NOT POLITICAL IN THE CURRENT U.S. CONTEXT -- Let's take
our heads out of the sand. Any non-poetry reader with any intelligence
who read the above exchanges would be amused and horrified at how out
of touch we are.  Bowling has more political impact than poetry.

I know some on the list will claim that everything has a political
dimension. True enough.  But having a political dimension is not the
same as having a RELEVANT political dimension. I define "relevant" as
the ability to alter public policy.  Poetry cannot do this in the
current climate because, except for the NEW CRITERION crowd, we are all
part of the same voting block. All of our differences are mute from a
political perspective

Those who argue that the personal are the poltical are deluded.  While
this was a liberating slogan in about 1970, it has dated about as well
as Nehru jackets. My decision to sit in my basement office --which I
built myself, no political relevancy --  write a poem, edit it, send it
to out and get it published is personal.  It's not in the least
political.  It has no impact on how we as a nation or how my local
community chooses to organize itself in terms of the production and
allocation of wealth and in terms of how we protect personal liberty.
Wake up.

What does such poetic activity do? It helps me to be more aware of the
language around me so I can take pleaseure in it, be outraged by its
poor uses, make new things, be a better conversationalist, think more
complex thoughts, etc.  All of which have a political dimension.  None
of which has a RELEVANT political dimension. It alters voting blocks
not a bit.

Poetry is too important to confuse it with politics.  Politics are too
important to be confused with poetry.

The most effective "political poems"  of the past thirty years have
been awful as literature --Vietnam war protest poems.  I'm glad that
they were written.  I in a heartbeat would write doggerel for a
political rally if I felt it would help rediistrubute the wealth.  But
I wouldn't claim that it was good poetry.

2.  I CHOSE POETRY AS A VOCATION RATHER THAN POLITICS FOR A REASON --
Some relatives of mine had a hand in forming the modern U.S. welfare
state when they worked for the Nixon and Johnson administrations.  We
agree that I couldn't stand political work.  It is rarely creative.
Day in and day out they attended meetings where they said the same
thing, made the same arguments, tried to convince people of the same
thing. They then tried to convince others with the same arguments, by
saying the same thing, etc. Politics takes doggedness, determination,
and single-mindedness.  I'm determined, but my creative bent does not
lend itself to doggedness nor to single-mindedness.

I chose poetry, or rather poetry chose me, because I like to find ways
to articulate experience.  Saying the same thing over and over bores me.

We are poets because we are not fit for politics. Let's be proud of it.
 We'd probably be lousy politicians anyway.

3.  I AM POLTICALLY ACTIVE--  Indeed, a year ago I used this list to
instigate a letter writing campaign protesting the hanging of Nigerian
writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. That was an attempt to be political.  It wasn't
my first.  I'm fairly active.  But doing that stuff day in and day out
would drive me crazy.

I grew up in Green Bay, WI, not far from where a statue of Joseph
McCarthy stands in Appleton's city hall.  As a teenager, I accompanied
my father in door-to-door canvassing on behalf of Leftist politicians.
I was afraid. So was he.

In many countries, writing poetry can get you in trouble. Not in the
U.S. In those countries, perhaps poetry can be politically relevant.

4.  WHY DO WE WANT TO CLAIM POETRY IS POLITICALLY RELEVANT--At least
since Milton, poetry in the English language has made various attempts
to influence politics.  None more extreme than Ezra Pound's. While I
abhor Pound's politics, he has been the most successful Modern poet in
terms of catching the ear of power.  I believe that we are still living
in the shadow of his ambition:  We still believe that, if poetry is to
matter, it must have a political impact.

This is dangerous. Politics by its nature is compromise.  Poetry by its
nature is not.  Politics in the democratic sense is formed by groups of
people haranguing, compromising, grandstanding, and fudging.  Poetry by
its nature is more dogmatic.

Poetry is radically creativity. From the ground up. This sort of
creativity can only happen when a few are in charge and the rest are
forced to shut up.  (Revolutions I don't believe have accomplished
anything in terms of redistributing wealth,power, and liberty to the
disenfranchised.  Day in day out political work has.)

Poets who enter politics in their capacity as poets run the risk of
falling to the temptation of totalitarianism.

Jeff -

I'm crazy about the tone of your post. But I have a question about this
paragraph:

>This is dangerous. Politics by its nature is compromise.  Poetry by its
>nature is not.  Politics in the democratic sense is formed by groups of
>people haranguing, compromising, grandstanding, and fudging.  Poetry by

And then this one:

>Poets who enter politics in their capacity as poets run the risk of
>falling to the temptation of totalitarianism.

My question is this: isn't totalitarianism often described as the
aestheticization of politics? the attempt to remove the 'fudging' of
argument
and compromise?

A related question might be: is poetry well-served by the idea 'No
Compromise'? I know that the poems I like best were twitted, revised, and
rebutted by other poets than their authors, and that the authors took some
of the suggestions floated to them.

Anyway, right on,
Jordan

Subject:      There was a reading in Providence? What about Brown?

Because Gale Nelson is temporarily off-list, I am forwarding on his
behalf the following response to Rob Hardin's recent post (future
participants in this discussion may wish to "cc" their messages to
Gale directly at the address given at the close of his post):

Steve,
Thank you for forwarding to me the message from the UB Poetics discussion
group, where reference to the night of Unspeakable Practices III that I
had the pleasure of hosting is examined by Mr. Hardin. If you would be
willing to convey to Mr. Hardin and to the Poetics group in general my
apologies of replying through you, I would be deeply grateful -- as a
variant reading of the night described in passing may be useful.

As noted, this is not the first installment of Unspeakable Practices at
Brown, named for Donald Barthelme's collection of stories. The first
installment took place in the spring of 1988, and was a celebration of
the retirement of John Hawkes. Many of the post-mod crowd were there, with,
most memorably to my young, spinning head, a beautifully sinister reading
by William Gass taking place in Manning Chapel. His reading from The Tunnel
left me shaking with belief in the ability of language well-crafted to
move a person to emotional states. Ah, to be young, and to be hearing
Gass or Mei-mei Berssenbrugge for first time!

The second installment of Unspeakable Practices came in 1993, I believe,
with a big line-up of younger writers, where a confrontation between print
and electronic venues became the core discussion. A celebration of Fiction
Collective was included as one of many centerpiece events.

The third installment of Unspeakable Practices took place earlier this month.
Again, a few dozen writers descended upon Brown, to discuss, argue and play
out what narrative literature might be. Among the focus points was a night
to celebrate the Dalkey Archive. As editor of a small press, and not being
a writer of fiction, I was asked by Bob Coover to host that night, as he
figured  that I could put Dalkey's successes into perspective, and give the
cursory introductions necessary to keep an eight-or-nine (or more?) reader
night moving along with something akin to speed. So, following my words of
praise for the Dalkey mission, I introduced Carole Maso, who has recently
been hired as Director of the Program. She referenced how important small
presses have been to her growth as a writer, first via North Point and then
through the tireless support of Dalkey. She noted that the night before the
spotlight had been on writers whose work had found a home in places like the
New Yorker, and that this would be a different kind of night -- a night
dedicated to the small press author. Then, Carole went on to read from her
latest book, Aureole, just out from Ecco.

Later in the evening, another reader referenced the comments Carole had made,
and noted that she would be happy enough to be published by the New Yorker. I
was given to understand that these comments were meant to "counter" those made
by Carole, because the feelings of three writers had been hurt -- three Brown
grads who had read the night before, and had seen their work published in the
New Yorker.

The offended gentlemen took umbrage from Carole's praise of the small presses,
in large part, I assume, because she made reference to the fact that the night
before, many of the readers had had access to larger publishing venues. It was
not, to my mind, a cutting remark made by Carole, intended to diminish the
other writers' participation in the event, rather, it was made to underline
the multiplicity of venues available for various types of writing. Comments
once made, are always open to interpretation. It is unfortunate that those
made by Carole were received in the most negative light possible by three
writers of talent and charm -- fancying myself as writer, I understand exactly
how easy it is to take any comment in the least pleasant manner possible,
then to hold onto that in anger. I do it all too often myself. I hope that
Brown's reputation for being a center for eclectic tastes in fiction, poetry
and playwriting will not be too seriously undermined because Carole's
desire to celebrate the small press was taken as a denigration of the large
(her next book, after all, is due out from Dutton!) within the context of
her making a few passing remarks before embarking on a lovely reading.

As many of you may know, Brown has hosted major conferences over the past
few years, many of them coordinated by Professor Robert Coover -- he, along
with visiting professor Nuruddin Farah, put together the 1991 Festival of
African Writing, which brought two-dozen writers and filmmakers to campus;
in addition, Bob Coover worked with students and visiting writers to host the
Original Voices festival of Innovative Women Narrative writers. Bob Coover &
I co-coordinated the Freedom to Write Festival this past spring, bringing
attention to the plight of writers who have been or are  under the threat of
persecution and prosecution, exile and death. Peter Gizzi, Marjorie Welish
and I put together a festschrift for Barbara Guest. Peter Gizzi, a visiting
faculty member, also put together a mini-festival called the Canadian
Emergency, focused on Canadian poetry. Keith & Rosmarie Waldrop and I put
together, in concert with SUNY Buffalo & Barnard College, a French Poetry
Festival last year. Queer Tales, a festival of gay and lesbian literature,
was coordinated by Eurudice (Kamvisseli), who was visiting faculty member.
And, of course, each year the Program sponsors a festival of New Plays,
featuring new dramatic texts by members of the Creative Writing Program.
The Program features events aplenty, such as upcoming readings by Ann
Lauterbach (6 Nov) and Brown graduates Martine Bellen & Edwidge Danticat
(7 Nov). We just featured two nights of readings by four New England
authors: Lori Baker, Michael Gizzi, Ray Ragosta & Craig Watson. Our
interests are wide, and our desire to enjoy is nearly unlimited. We hope
to make people welcome during their visits, and hope that the unpleasant
experiences of three writers will not overshadow the extraordinary
quality of experience had by the vast majority of those who come to our
festivals, conferences, readings series, plays and other programming.

People may also be interested to know that distinguished poet and professor,
Michael Harper, was just celebrated in Brunswick, Maine. "Celebrating Harper"
took place this past weekend at Bowdoin College, w/ readings and talks.

Thanks for your electronic hospitality,
Gale Nelson, Assistant Director, Creative Writing at Brown University

This is a huge question.  Obviously crucial to all.  Should be addressed
on the list.  One question for the list is can there be a political
dialogue (dialogue) as opposed to cacophony.

Like to perhaps build upon Yunte Huang's critique of Jeff Hansen's
arguments re poetry and politics.  Whose U.S. indeed: just as poetry
seems to have greater political effect outside of a liberal-democratic
context (does this suggest that perhaps a certain level of oppression and
torture is needed to make poetry relevant??), within that context the
experience of certain communities seems to suggest that poetry can have
relevant and immediate effect.

Because of my (shameful!) ignorance of contemporary U.S. writing, I can
only offer comments on developments within a Canadian context.  Here,
any notions of a homogeneous "national" literary community have been for
the most part replaced with a recognition that this field of cultural
production is fragmented into various constituencies defined under gender,
regional, "ethnic," or sexual signs.  Hansen seems to equate political
relevance with struggles to reduce income disparities.  What about the
role of poetry in identity politics?  Poetry in those instances can serve
not only to construct and define community identity but also to establish
the strategies under which "real" political action would be undertaken.
Given these criteria poetry produced by Quebecois writers,
Caribbean-Canadian writers in Toronto, and in particular native Canadian
writers would most certainly become "relevant" given yr definition of
"changing public policy."

The question which might undermine my argument would be: does poetry
affect political change, or does political change affect poetry?
Returning to the Canadian context, we might wonder whether this
framentation of a "national" literary community (did one ever really
exist?) is a cause or a consequence of a broader decentralization at the
political and economic levels.  I suspect it's a bit of both.

Sorry to bring up a context with which many of you may be unfamiliar
(though I do recognize a couple of names out there), but I suspect
similar arguments might be made regarding the relevance of poetry within a
U.S. context.

Seems like a good schoolteacher or carpenter or truck driver understands
the usefulness of their work.  They also understand that things don't happen
in a vacuum, that in the course of doing their work they're going to
get involved in human & community problems, & if they are lucky enough
to have some confidence & sense of direction they tend to infuse their
work with a personal stamp & a sense of connection with larger or other
issues.  Most of us had schoolteachers like that (maybe a few anyway).

Poets & artists, despite the fact that most of what they do goes on in the
playpen of society, have the strange sense that what they do is necessary
for a real apprehension of nature & reality.  It's the adequate response.
So it's also a kind of work, which it's possible to infuse with common
things like any other work.  If I were to choose another bigshot writer
to exemplify the political possibilities, it would be Shakespeare rather
than Pound.  One thing I've learned from the interaction on this list
is that general statements are usually one-sided & the opposite is almost
always just as true.  Jefferson's right, I think, to point up some
differences between poetry & politics, in a contemporary arena in which
EVERYTHING is theatricalized.  But by the same token, Shakespeare among
many others always holds out the example of a possibility: in which
poetry & art remain themselves while examining in subtle detail very
topical political questions.  & we live in a time (some of us) &  a
place (some of us) which allows for more freedom of expression than
the Bard had.  So there's always the possibility of the play that
changes the conscience of a culture (or helps in that direction).
Playwrights aim for this all the time.  But then, maybe poetry &
theatre, too, have very distinct aims... blah blah goodnight all

It's William Walsh, not "Warsh," and the point of his exchange with Marjorie
Perloff re Oppen and other matters is to distinguish between "political
identity" and "political efficacy."  But the exchange is about readings of
Oppen, not about politics and poetry in the abstract, which is (for me anyway)
nearly always a bankrupt subject.  No one is surprised that (much) poetry has
little IMPACT politically speaking, not directly anyway; it DOES have more
impact than bowling because of its situation--spaces--in mediating institutions
such as pedagogy, cris cheek's rock 'n thump 'em in the head we come to you
live with bad tech post-punk show, etc.  Have to consider those institutions/
sites/cultural forms if you wanna talk poetries and politics.

Sorry, can't go on.  Just wanted to get the names and issues straight.  As for
politics(with apologies to those in the UK,Canada, Australia, etc.) I'd think
we'd do better--say--to discuss the arguments of Michael Lind's _The Next
American Nation_ or the reading of those same arguments (and others) by
Walter Benn Michaels in _Transition_ 70.  Or some such arguments which have a
SPECIFIC focus.

jeff--
you raise many important distinctions between politics and poetry that
are often glossed over in discussing the two. but if you shrink the
politically relevant sphere to those acts that have "the ability to alter
public policy," then it gets tricky: who's to say that poetry doesn't, in
some remote _but relevant_ way, influence public policy? true, few
will ever write a poem that will have more political relevance than
casting a ballot, but i'd argue that every act of writing is a sort of
ballot-casting in that writing is, at base, a social act.
for example, you mentioned yr own writing as a process of developing "more
complex thoughts":  don't these thoughts, in turn, inform yr political
ideologies and social actions? can a poem be an act of political
persuasion like knocking on those doors in green bay? isn't a poem
involved with "arguing and convincing"?
you mentioned the political efficacy of vietnam protest poetry. what makes
these works politically relevant: their direct references to the war?
their being read within a larger social context (political demonstrations,
rallies, etc.)?
what you said about poetry being more dogmatic than politics is
interesting. i'd say it depends on the politics.
back to the poet as "unaknowledged legislator": why are laws written? why
are poems written? is politics an act of conservation (laws) and poetics
an act of liberation? is their some sort of antiphonal exchange between
these domains? what, if anything, does a poet "legislate"?
in perelman's _marginalization_, talking about language, politics and
power, he mentions that "Shelley can only promise power that is total but
undeliverable." conversely,  politicians (the veritable legislators) can
only promise power that is deliverable but not total. when i try to
conceive of a poetics or politic that's both deliverable and total, i
don't envision pound's paradise, but mussolini's horror.

I am somewhat baffled by the idea that poetry doesn't effect "practical
politics."  Seems to me that Allen Ginsberg and Gary Synder have had a
greater political impact on the United States than all but a handful of
members of the Senate in the past 50 years.  Not every poet has a
political impact in this narrow practical political sense (not every poet
wants to, and not every poet that wants to succeeds), but the impact is
there.

This is incorrect.

What Julia actually translated were Nietzsche's last letters,
which were published as _My Sister and I_ by Amok Press. There
is some controversy as to the true authorship of the letters;
Julia reports that the letters were extremely difficult to translate
because they were written in the language "of someone who was ragingly
insane."

I think Kieth Tuma's right to point out poetry's role in pedagogical
instituions as one primary way in which its politics is marked. It
would be hard to argue, for instance, that the reproduction of certain
idoelogical orientations hasn't been central to the project of New
Crticism (particularly as it survives in the majority of college-
level writing workshops). See Jed Rasula's _The American Poetry
Wax Museum_ for more on this...

Of course, this isn't an argument for the political "efficacy" of
poetics, only for poetry's role as a carrier of various assumptions,
and thus as a site for the unsettling of such assumptions...

Gale:

Are you under the impression that a negative reading of the '96 UP
readings was the substance of my post? If so, your impression was not
what I intended. In my post, I stated that I wished to hear from people
like yourself, who might explain how the very festival that I myself
enjoyed--the festival that I mention proudly in every bio and press kit,
whether it be PR for music or for writing--could have become an event
that infuriated my friends. My post was not a "reading": I wasn't there.
Rather, it was a plea for more positive "readings" and explanations.

>The second installment of Unspeakable Practices came in 1993, I believe,

93 is correct. To be exact, the Unspeakable Practices II Vanguard Narrative
Festival at Brown University took place between February 24-27, 1993.

>with a big line-up of younger writers, where a confrontation between print
>and electronic venues became the core discussion. A celebration of Fiction
>Collective was included as one of many centerpiece events.

True enough. This description doesn't differ markedly from my own--which
is not negative, but rather affectionate and impressed.

>Again, a few dozen writers descended upon Brown,

Again, a few dozen writers were *invited* by Brown...

Here's the problem for me, Gale--the very problem that prompted my post.
By nature, writers are a paranoid lot: they work in isolate rooms, occluded
from contact with their audience, and temporarily banished from gratifying
collaborations. It is easy enough for them to feel insulted and undervalued,
and to become solipsistic. Thus, even when I was told of various perceived
slights by my friends, I could have easily dismissed said slights, had they
not come from *three different writers*, only one of whom *might* have been
the "offended gentleman" you mention. (Though these writers don't hang out
together, I happen to know them all.)

I'm loyal to my memory of Brown, but I'm also loyal to my friends.
If the New Yorker comments were so utterly inoffensive, then why were
three New York writers so deeply offended?

>I hope that
>Brown's reputation for being a center for eclectic tastes in fiction, poetry
>and playwriting will not be too seriously undermined because Carole's
>desire to celebrate the small press was taken as a denigration of the large
>(her next book, after all, is due out from Dutton!) within the context of
>her making a few passing remarks before embarking on a lovely reading.

Unfortunately, the New Yorker comment was not the only complaint I heard.

I'm also told that Carole read classic texts beside those of guest authors,
and that the effect was unflattering to her guests. Generally, the sense I
had was that these writers felt *neglected*--a perception that runs contrary
to my personal experience of Brown.

>As many of you may know, Brown has hosted major conferences over the past
>few years, many of them coordinated by Professor Robert Coover -- he, along

As many of you may have guessed, the intention of my missive was not to
compare the literary faculty of Brown U. to the occupants of the House of
Usher, nor was it to confine and circumscribe Brown's literary activities to
the Unspeakable Practices Festival series. It was precisely because my
personal experience of Brown was so positive that the reactions of my
friends upset me. If my post somehow offended you, Gale, or the writer
who allegedly offended these other writers, then the god of irony will
be well pleased. But *I* won't be pleased--not at all. I was quite aware
that my post might stir up controversy which could somehow impact negatively
on me. Nevertheless, I posted anyway, because:

1. I couldn't bear to hear dismissive comments about UP without knowing
the other side.
2. These NY writers talk to other writers in my community. Their views
are received a la carte (without conflicting argument or evidence). If
there is a case to be made in UP's favor, I'd like to be able to present it.
3. The milieu I visited in 1993 would never excommunicate me from its
graces simply because I asked a few difficult questions in public.

The main thing I wish to make clear is this: I did not intend any slight
to Brown and *particularly* not to Robert Coover, who is brilliant and who
went out of his way to make myself and others feel welcome. The defining
act of mediocrity is to refuse to acknowledge good work. By inviting me
to Brown, Coover helped me immeasurably: Once there, I made contacts
that have helped me to this day. I'm meeting Eurydice later this evening,
for example. If it were not for Coover, I would probably not know her at
all.

To acknowledge the good work at Brown: that is the main thing.
The rest--all slights, complaints and controversy--is gossip,
however deeply felt and earnestly reported.

All the best,

Rob Hardin

Subject:      politics & poetry

Agreeing w/ Keith on the dryness of more abstract chat about this subject,
NEVERTHELESS I can't help adding something more.  There has always been,
now & then, very topical political poetry which is also real poetry.
Whether it finds an audience which is also in a position to affect
government policy or social structures depends on circumstances.  But
the intellectual & moral commitment can result in an accurate witness
to a politically-manipulated reality.  There is an act of faith involved
in the effort to create such work, which in a literary culture of authentic
vitality, might actually lead to "political efficacy".  On the other
hand, I wouldn't want to create an idol out of this aspect of poetry.
Poetry has its own raison d'etre & doesn't need a political imprimature.
It's we ourselves, people, who are called to account
in a political sense.   - Henry gould

Subject:      Re: politics & poetry

just couldn't let this thread slip by w/o comment... jeff---thanx for
stating some assumptions that are, i think, generally & tacitly felt &
operated on within specific poetry communities (if not this one)... i don't
find mself agreeing with you, in part for the reasons stated in others'
posts, but i think i understand where you're coming from...

i believe it probably is futile, if not dangerous, to attempt to
distinguish between politics & politics in foundational terms... but there
is, at the level of political action, all sorts of room for such
distinguishing features... & if there's not, we're all in a heck of a lot
more trouble than we think, b/c we ourselves won't be able to distinguish
between political acts that result in something better & political acts
that result in something worse... that is, our capacity for distinguishing
so requires, at the very least, that we can recognize those acts that have
little or no effective political import...

perhaps the good (better?) way to situate this discussion is not in terms
of poetry per se, but in terms of---surprise surprise---the academic
discipline of political science (& jeff, please forgive me for pushing this
discussion in a non-poetic & academic direction) ... b/c polisci presumes
to speak of politics in ways that presumbably political... by which i mean,
addressed to the public sphere of politics per se... which---yes---*is* a
reduction of the broader category, but one which i'm willing to treat in
such terms simply b/c, as jeff suggests, there is a widespread public
conception that this is what constitutes politics (which latter observation
speaks to the question of what constitutes politics, whether one agrees or
no)...

one of the best (academic) books i know to deal with this problem is john
g. gunnell's _between philosophy and politics:  the alienation of political
theory_ (u of mass p, 1986)... when i first picked i up, seven-eight years
ago, it stopped me dead in my tracks... gunnell's work deserves broader
reading, not least b/c he's attuned to the way  academic discourse
communities reproduce what (in his & often in my view are) academic (i.e.,
moot) political arguments... i mean, i take gunnell's critique to be a
substantive critique of my motivations as an academic, albeit i think his
critique generally operates (curiously) at a philosophical remove from the
direct political context i find mself in day after day (i.e., the
classroom)... & i don't necessarily agree with gunnell either,
non-committal as i am this morn, though again find his provocations
useful...

here's an excerpt, to give some idea of why gunnell is such a challenge...
he's arguing for what he calls his (very wittgensteinian) 'theory of
conventional objects':

"The theory of conventional objects does not yield the kind of revealed
truth and therapeutic authority that political theory has sought, but it
has critical implications---not the least of which is the denial not only
of the transcendental character of any political configuration but of the
political form itself.  If the history of political theory, the classic
texts, can offer us any wisdom, it is surely the knowledge that by its very
nature politics is a form of life grounded in varying degress of lie and
illusion.  Thus an exploration of the world of political meaning and its
'ontology' and 'epistemology' is potentially, and maybe almost
automatically, a critical activity.  It is almost by necessity a claim to
understand politics better than it understands itself.  But neither the
truth of that claim nor its practical consequences are self-validating."
(221)

anyway...

best,

joe

Subject:      "Politics"? "Poetry"?

        To me, Jeff Hansen's recent post seems most useful in reminding us
that it's very easy to use the phrase "political" in an unconsidered
manner, and that uses of the word "political" need to pay close attention
to what it means to call something "political" at all. The word clearly
has a complicated history, and has been used in a variety of contexts for
a variety of reasons.

        I think what Jeff suggests is that use of the word "political"
ought to commit us to a careful elucidation of what the term can mean. In
Jeff's post, he wants to refer the term "political" solely to electoral
politics as a way of not engaging in fuzzy sloganeering. That seems useful
as a corrrective, but what it then makes me want to explore is various
TYPES of politics, whether those different types share things in common
and effect each other, and perhaps also to question whether speaking of
them as "political" is the most useful way to think of them.

Tentatively, here, I can think of several areas of American life to which
the term "political" might be applied.

1) Electoral politics on national, state, and local levels. What things
are actually in real question in these politics is to me crucial--one
might argue, for instance, that most issues of huge significance to the
lives of people in the U.S. never enter the political arena at all.

2) The politics of information. What ideas on what subjects are presented
to whom, in what contexts, and with what kinds of limitations. Relevant
formations here at the very least include publishing companies, academic
institutions, newspapers and perhaps much else.

3) The "politics" of daily interraction. To what extent is it useful, or
not, to think of our daily encounters with others as forming a politics?
Relevant issues here would include group and identity politics, work
issues, many others.

Obviously, I'm doing this very sketchily (and on a bad moden too), but
questions that the above groupings would suggest to me include what the
interactions between these groups are (obviously, #2 and #3 are often so
close as to be indistuinguishable) and how they all relate to the central
problems of another term that needs careful clarification: POWER.

I really wish I could say more, but the modem I'm on is barely
functioning.

To my reading of Jefferson's post, "politics" referred to US government policy.
His point, again from my perspective, was that poetry being written today (and
the poetry of the last 30 years) is politically irrelevant because it comes
nowhere close to affecting government policy (policies), the policy makers or
their constituents on any significant level, DESPITE the opposite claims of
many poets writing today.

The obvious Poetics list reaction is to break down the term "politics" (the
politics of saying howdy, the politics of this-n-that, etc). Can anyone refute
Jeff's statements?  I cannot.  Someone mentioned Ginsberg and Snyder, but
failed to offer exactly HOW their wonderfully political poetry has been
effective.

Jeff:
Surely you're right on to say that mottos/mantras like "the personal
is political" may serve to get poets off the hook, so to speak.  And
I think Oppen clearly had a sense that writing poems could/should not
substitute for direct political action; this was, I submit, his 'choice'
and not an infinitely extendable theorem.  Oppen's decision is rather
carefully framed (in the poems, _Meaning A Life_, and scattered essays)
as a response to a particular then-present moment and an assessment of
his own 'style' (poor word) of poetry.  In fact, Oppen almost goes so
far as to say that some 'polemical' poetries are (in your terms)
politically relevant--though he couldn't/wouldn't write them.

Poetry is political but not relevantly so?  You get tangled on this word,
as if it makes sense to use 'relevant' without hinging it to some context:
eg. 'poetry is not relevant to a present political situation in which only
direct action has force'etc.  But I don't think you can lay out that
context without great difficulty.

Sure Ron Silliman's poetry doesn't have the save 'effect' (if that's now
a synonym for relevance) as Black Panther's activism; but it is relevant
to my politics and to a political world.  Frankly Jeff, we could use a
yes-and logic here, rather than either-or.

And the idea that the 'relevant political' action must get you in
trouble, that being 'acknowledged' by the state/powers etc. determines
relevance mistakes surface effect for deep politics.  Charmed as
I was to see protestors smashing the windows in downtown Buffalo outside
a Bob Dole rally early in the campaign, I'm pretty certain that the
simple political conversations which take place in my English 201
will having longer lasting and deeper implications.

Well, political is one of those ultraproblematic words but in a
post-Frankfurt School culture it has to have meanings that adhere to
spheres of culture and can be read alongside praxis, I think.

Let's assume Jeff is right (though maybe many aren't ready to do so).
The interesting question then, is why has the poetry of the last 30 years
been politically irrelevant?

Good question.  I don't have a clue!  But here are some possibilities:

1. Poetry in general is irrelevant in U.S.  People don't read books or
listen to such things before deciding what to think or do.  "Literature"
is immersed in & superceded by pop culture.  Bob Dylan, at least in
the early 60s, was most effective political poet (c.f. "Masters of War"
etc.)  Jefferson Airplane a close 2nd.

2. Poetry in US is too busy being at war with itself, since New Critics
dehydrated it & Beats soaked it in "tea" etc.  Style politics are poetry's
version of "identity politics".

3. US, as hegemonic democracy/empire, is in curious position of having freedom
to continually argue about & redefine itself.  There is no clear benchmark or
ground-bass upon which a penetrating political poetry can assume a common
audience.  & freedom of speech brightens the background, against which
poetry, rather than standing out, is camouflaged.

4. The poets who can really MAKE good political poetry have yet to appear.

etc. but I'm going to shut up for a few seconds. this is getting interesting,

The populace is political but not relevantly so.

Chomsky talks of disagreement with those that argue the importance of
"speaking truth to power" because those with power will not/cannot hear.
Poetry is one aspect of keeping our humanity intact, it's a real & reasonable
resistance/enabler. But it does not stand in for organizing, neither can
organizing stand in for poetry.

Jeff's point about politics being "compromise" unfortunately seems less &

This is Dodie.  Even though I've been doubtful of "political" poetry having
any effectiveness whatsoever (enjoy Spicer's slamming of political poetry
in his Berkeley lecture), I think that we have to be leery of setting up
any sorts of dualisms like this, i.e. poetry vs. politics.  Doing so, we're
falling into the very mindset that made the world as f*cked up as it is
today.

This thread arose not long after I'd been rereading David Wojanarowicz's
"Postcards from America."   Wojanarowicz makes a strong case for the
necessity of *public* gestures.  A couple of excerpts concerning AIDS
memorial services:

"I realized halfway through the event that I had witnessed a good number of
the same people participating in other previous memorials.  What made me
angy was realizing that the memorial had little reverberation outside the
room it was held in.  A tv commericial for handiwipes had a higher impact
on the society at large. =8A I imagine what it would be like if friends had =
a
demonstration each time a lover or a friend or a stranger died of AIDS.  I
imagine what it would be like if, each time a lover, friend or stranger
died of this disease, their friends, lovers or neighbors would take the
dead body and drive with it in a car a hundred miles an hour to wasington
d.c. and blast through the gates of the white house and come to a
screeching halt before the entrance and dump their lifeless form on the
front steps.  It would be comforting to see those friends, neighbors,
lovers and strangers mark time and place and history in such a public way."

Yesterday I was reading an excerpt from Audre Lorde's _Cancer Journals_ in
which she denounced the "travesty of prosthesis" in regards to the immense
social pressure placed on women who've had mastectomies to wear breast
protheses.  Now, I had never thought about this issue before, but Lorde's
argument certainly had an impact on me.  Lorde's essay isn't "poetry" and
it's not likely to change any govenment policies.  But if it affects the
opinions of random (wo)men like myself over time, of course it's having a
political impact.

POLITICS IN A POST HOTDOG CULTURE  (Village Explanation #112 & a half)

He he he was talking I I I think about politics proper,
that is "the art of governance", the realm of force
(force of law or force of arms) whereby
a social order is adhered to & maintained.
In a legislative democracy
the force of law is ultimate authority,
where social order is submitted to the rule
of what mankind at present time considers justice.
Granted such authority then, government, of course, becomes
a nexus of power.

This sense of politics proper, then, the nexus of
power & authority, is grafted into multifarious social
controversies over how to live & who is what & what is good
& so we have a "politics" of this and that & the word
gets ULTRAPROBLEMATIC (i.e. who decides what gets submitted
to legislative adjudication & how).

& the ship sailed on.
Pray heaven wisdom guides the navigators
through the alligators.

& talk to your legislators.)  (at least in sleepy, sleazy little Rhody)

Saw Craig Baldwin's film _Sonic Outlaws_  today, which is a documentary
montage of the Negativeland/U2/Island Records debacle, media pranking,
unlicensed sampling, culture jamming by media/arts/activist groups like the
Emergency Broadcast Network or the Barbie Liberation Organization, billboard
detourning, and a great deal more. Left convinced that if nothing else,
"politically" effective poetry, in order to be so, must be responsive to the
media ecology. That's when (where) art finds its interface with public
policy, and things like copyright and intellectual property laws, FCC
regulations, and yelling fire in a crowded movie theater become *relevant*.

(I don't want to homogenize the word "media", by the way; Martin Spinelli's

compelling in this regard . . .)

Bill Clinton spoke today at Upenn to a precisely blocked throng.  The
Secret Service took my wrench at the frisk-zone.  Bill showed up late, no
surprise, and gave a decent speech (mix of plaisanterie and niaiserie).
Somehow he managed to applaud the Greek education system as model, then
later did his obligatory techno-celebration by proudly proclaiming even
Socks the cat has a homepage.  A friend said to me, "This is the most
political thing I've done all year." The "Rocky Theme Song" was playing
in the background.  Is that relevant so?  Well, I'll definitely say it was
the largest gathering of students I have ever seen (about about 10,000).
Out of the many, many more.  We were being-political perhaps when we
raised our "Clinton/Gore" placards but were we being-political when we
left the cardboard for litter on the grass?  I was involved, I sweated
and swatted other students, applied tip-toes to see president, sneaking
glances at someone's beautifully dark green eyes next to me, ditching
classes. Is that relevant so?  We are losing our ability to experience the
world, I think, as I'm stuck behind a very tall person.  Politics
perhaps, but obviously nothing happened here.

Forgive my somewhat blunt critique of that blunt statement. But growing up
in a Communist country, it's mighty-rangerly hard for me not to see
everything "red." Not an excuse like "my parents kicked my ass hard when I
was a kid." But it's something personal, but also political. I can't see
the separation of the two. Maintaining a political edge on a personal
level could be utopia, but refusing to see or make it have varying degrees
of political effects is self-defeating "no can't do."

It does not take a Mao to be political, who, by the way, was a great poet.

Ah, what about poetry? I would say it depends on who writes, in what way,
and for what. That's why I can't accept the notion that "POETRY" is not
political. I don't wanna force y'all to accept Steve MacCaffrey's "poetry
is politics that stays politics (?)". I would say many poetries and poets
do consciously maintain their political edges in their writings. It
doesn't influence the outcome of electorial votes? You mean to say that
poets or teachers teach students and readers nothing but neutral texts? I
know the frustration over the "futility"(?) when you try to stir up
something among 1.2 billion people, but as C Bernstein quotes somebody
else: "It's impossible, but it's exactly why it's taking place."

To take the occasion of the current "cacophony" over poetry and politics,
I send out this call for submissions to a new magazine, _Displace_.

_Displace_ (i.e. This Place, or Dis-place, etc.) focuses on new writings
and translations from literary traditions other than _______ (you fill in
the blank and define "this place," your place). Poetry, prose, journal
entries, translations and commentaries, short essays and reviews, will all
be considered. Works-in-progress which mean (or even if you don't mean it,
as they say) to reconsider or challenge ole perspectives and notions of
other literary traditions are especially welcome. Recent submissions under
considerations include:
--Radical new translations from Chinese poetry;
--transcriptions of and commentaries on Greek mountain "theft" songs;
--readings and commentaries of Zen-Buddist texts;
--travel poems from Tibet;
--poetic journal entries;
--poems.

While I find Jeff Hansen's recent post, again, as a convincing corrective
to overly vague uses of the word "political," I think I find myself also
agreeing with Rod Smith when he starts talking about how many of the
central concerns of most people in the U.S. are not relevant to politics
"here" (my apologies to those on the list who aren't "here"). I'm going to
begin a list of things
that have no effect on American electoral politics--please feel free to
add to it.

Things Not Relevant To American Politics

--The wages of Chief Executive Officers
--What it feels like to be out of work
--Visual Art, Literature, Music
--Widespread Enforced Illiteracy
--Anything which can't be reduced to an economic basis
--The increasing elimination of stable jobs, reasonable wages, health
insurance and other necessary benefits
--Critiques of the macho competitors who run U.S. corporations
--Any political alternatives to capitalism, and anyone who objects to
making themselves into a saleable product

I could think of more, but I've got to go back to producing.

Unfortunately, my server was down for a while and I did not receive all

Things are winding down, but here's my final thought:  If we claim
political efficacy as the justification for our poetry, then we are in
trouble. Few people other than academic hair splitters will buy it.

Subject:      new awp...

i wonder if any of you have had a chance to check out the lead article in
the new awp chronicle?... under the deceptively simple title "the shape of
poetry," paul lake discusses free verse and formalism in the context of
chaos theory and the like...

regrettably, i found that the article constitutes yet another in a recent
and lengthening line of mixing metaphors on chaos (e.g., poems become
'strange attractors' w/o any discussion of how to conceive of a poem in
terms of equilibrium conditions and the like (the slip here, he sez, having
to do with situating motivated processes and products, like writing and
poetry, in terms similar to natural processes)) and surprisingly (perhaps i
shouldn't be so shocked, but i was), it would seem that lake's ultimate aim
[and paul---if you're out there someplace, please feel free to respond] is
to argue for the superior recursiveness of FORMAL VERSE (!---anybody
familar with the sciences of complexity should raise an eyebrow or two
here)... here's an excerpt:

"Through parallelisms of syntax and similarities of metaphors and sounds,
free verse can sometimes attain isolated expressions of self-similarity in
its parts and approximations of order in its overall design; but with fewer
rules and less feedback to amplify and vary its constituent elements, it
generally fails to achieve the same degree of self-similarity and scaling
we find in the best formal verse."

and following g.m.hopkins' lead, lake suggests that "free verse [is] merely
*technical* in nature"... key word here, for me, being *nature*...

anyway... along the way, lake provides us with a longish reading of pound &
ammons, a quick & dirty reading of olson (who "composed on a typewriter and
thought in spatial terms"---which latter prevented him, presumably, from
grasping the temporal dimension proper!) and an insight or two from
frederick turner, who, we are informed, "has found what might be the most
remarkable use of self-similarity in all of literature in Dante's _Divine
Comedy_"---namely, the division of same into threes, to match the trinity,
the three line stanza, etc. (and i can only wonder what medieval scholars
would say to this)...

if i sound a bit irritated, this is b/c i am!... i wouldn't have minded
these and other (somewhat misguided) claims so much if they had not been
put in the service of arguing formal hierarchies... but as it stands,
lake's piece reads like a quasi-scientific polemic, along the lines of that
item i mentioned here some time ago, david whyte's work on poetry and the
corporation...

anyway... apologies to gwyn and others who are more directly involved in
awp (i'm a member mself), but i thought it worth my time to render some
critique here...

best,

Yunte Huang, in a fresh air way, & yours truly, in a stuffy fuzzy old
wasp yankee way, were saying the same thing, I think: that poetry &
politics can be & are integrated in practice (whether it's poetry
theater addressed to issues or "political edge" throughout).  But
politics is power yes, & POLITICAL justification for poetry is
another form of the corrupting influence of power.  Poetry's cachet
is in the poet's independent sense of rightness, with "independent"
underlined.  Mao was a great poet?  I'm not in a position to judge,
but his power makes me doubt it.  Julius Caesar, though, was a great
prose writer.  Then again, I'd have to agree with C. Bernstein
"it's impossible, that's why it's happening" (inexact quote)

The poem falls like a stone from heaven.

Speaking of poetry with clout, has anybody other than me read the
obscure book by Eugenio Zolli in which he argues that Jesus's
appellation "the Nazarene" does not refer to his place of birth
but to his affiliation (or alleged affiliation) with a spiritual
group called the Nazarenes, or "singers", known for chanting
proverbs & songs in public poetry recitals?  Zolli says that
material like the Sermon on the Mount was probably sung or
chanted.  Now there's a poet-organizer for you.

Later Rod alluded to this book and said, "Moxley manages a genuinely public
poetry without sacrificing the cognitive and emotional dissonance that is
our tired lot
here, in monogomy capitalism."  I don't know if I agree with this way of
describing "Imagination Verses" but I second him in urging people to get a
copy of this book, it is quite interesting and often very intensely
beautiful.  Half the time I was reading it I was thinking, "I wish I were
Jennifer Moxley," and the other half thinking, I'm glad I'm not," (maybe
that's RS's emotional dissonance") but I've decided to change my life since
reading it.

In other words, you're saying American democracy doesn't work.  Just
curious - have you ever actually worked on passing state or federal
legislation, Rod?  I wonder what Jefferson thinks of this (I mean

        Re politics & poetry--isn't one of the contexts for this
discussion to be found in Plato?  As I recall, the Philospher is on the
side of the State, from which poets must be banished . . .
        The turn of the discussion here seems to be following a similar
course--immediately equating politics with the State and swiftly moving
to the level of abstraction and generalization. Keith Tuma had pointed
out the need for specifics in this discussion . . . here are a few
that may be of use:
        for Poetry/the State/pedgagogy/suicide/economics . . . :  How Are
Verses Made  by Vladimir Mayakovsky. (cd. be basis of quite a discussion
. . . )

        Remember Tip O'Neil's "all politics is local"?  Whatever you
think of Tip, it's a good tip--
        the local is a specific place with a specific history, ecology,
and inhabitants.  And the inhabitants have bodies.  One way of thinking
of the interelationship of poetry and politics at a local level is to
examine the interrelationship of bodies to and with and in their
environment.  (For example:  toxic waste dumps in poor and minority
neighborhoods.Spread of Hepatitus C among areas/populations with poor
medical service access .. . ) (For "literary
example" of poetry/prose & local & body, turn to WCW's work from Kora in
Hell to The Descent of
Winter, often written during periods of influenza and other epidemics . . .)
        The interrelationship of poetry, politics and the local in action
may be found in Maximus to Gloucester--Charles Olson's Letters to the
Gloucester paper.  For an excellent intro to the book and information on
it--you cd, check out Karl Young's review/essay at Light and Dust page,
Grist On-Line http://www.thing.net/~grist or at the Olson "authors pages"
at the SUNY-Buffalo "Electronic Poetry Center".

        Working with specific people and sites at a local level, for me a poet
who continually opens things up as they say in terms of the body in
relation to language is bpNichol. (in relation to the local--Mike Boughn
has pointed out to me the role Toronto street signs play in the
Martyrology Book 5).
        bpNichol worked in visual poetry, sound poetry, performance,
recording, tv, prose, xerox (see TTA 26), editing, collaborations--his work
presents a
multilplicity of directions, suggestions, situations, notations, examples
with which to work--
        from Line #6, Fall 1985, "A Conversation:  'Syntax Equals the
Body Structure': bpNichol, with Daphne Marlatt and George Bowering":
        (bpNichol, on page 25)
        So what I was trying to find, becuse that is part of a larger
thing that I've been working towards, is a way to increase my own formal
range (something I'm still trying to do), and therefore not merely be
stuck, shall we say, by the physical limitation of my body at that point,
i.e. just because I'm walking around with my shoulders up like this, if I
can learn to relax I can see the world in a slightly different way and so
on.  If i can keep moving the structure of the poem around, hopefully I
can encompass different realities and different ways of looking at
things.  In that sense I've always seen a connection between the
breathing I do and what comes out of me, the words I do, so syntax/body
structure, sequence/body structure, but also the body of the poem.

        from  the Martyrlogy Book Six (np):

        i's a lie
        dispenses illusions of plot

        biography when geography's the clue
        locale & history of the clear you

        Larry Eigner wrote poetry for a specific local project--a food
drive in  Chicago used an Eigner work.  And Eigner's sense of the act of
attention, combined with his sense of history and interest in the
local--did lead to the writing of poems concerned with the environment,
the homeless . . . Eigner's work exemplifies an attention developed in
relation to the body,to the local within which he moved, wrote,
looked out the window--listened to the news . . .music, baseball games--
        Poetry works with specifics, particulars, particles--a relation
there to "all politics is local"--
        not abstractions--but things you can hear and see and move among
and do something with--(hiphop and rap for example . . .tagging-the body,
site specificity, cite specificity in sampling, sight specificity in
recognizing relation of tag to "where you are this instant"-to paraphrase
WCW and Olson)--
        "How are verses made?
        Work begins long before one receives  or is aware of a social  command.
        Work goes on incessantly . . .
        A poet regards every meeting, ever signpost, every event in
whatever circumstances simply as material to be shaped into words words."
        --V.Mayakovsky, "How Are Verses Made"

        Not "impossibilities" "taking place", but possibilities being made actual.

Comments: To: "Aldon L. Nielsen" <anielsen@EMAIL.SJSU.EDU>

I thought this thread began with a remark about the politics of politics...

I wholly agree with Aldon: poetry needs no justification. Any other attitude
toward it is bureaucratic, to put it politely.

To regard a poem, though, as effecting change in the same way as a piece of
legislation is tricky, if not misleading. How do we reduce the container of
psychic energy to mere quanta? And in what way does a bill or law function
as a similar container?

I've never believed poetry merely to surive in the valley of its own saying
or whatever that line from Auden is, but at the same time pointing to
cause/effect type changes from poems vis-a-vis public perception of "issues"
is slippery business. Duncan & Levertov wrote some trenchant anti-war poems
in the 60's, and for me they have not really dated, but how far did they
affect a change in perception when they first appeared?

I don't think Aldon, that those Norweigan ads are quite the same thing as
"poems;" they ape the shape of poems and are flashy and all - also a way to
defeat the mute button on the remote and so are purely practical. More than
that, though, they are an acknowledgement that the field of visual
perception these days is running on overload. Verse and ads do go together
though, mnemonically speaking: there's an ad for Ford Escort right now that
rhymes. But that is only doggerel.

Snyder has, by any post-WWII standards re poetry, a huge audience--
particularly on the West Coast, but elsewhere too. He's very involved in
environmental issues. He's definitely a "leader" of some sort for many. It's
there in his essays & elsewhere.

"elsewhere" is the key word here,

H--
I've done some political hackwork which is unfortunately not demystifying of
the process. There once was a vigorous labor press-- THAT was demystifying.
Buy things like Z magazine & the Nation (not at B&N)-- they're needed.

I know Ron Silliman was quite involved for a while with governmental politics
in the bay area. He worked against, yes, "the indeterminate sentence," among
other things. They were locking people up & not telling them for how long.

The hope, I think, now rests in a bridge between the idea of all politics
being local & the reality that an incredible amount of power is in
international corporate hands. The barriers are huge but so are the
possibilities.

For what it's worth, I have a review of Kalaidjian's book, together with Alan
Filreis' recent one on Wallace Steven in the Thirties, entitled "The Red De-
cade & the Blue Guitar" (clever, huh?), in an upcoming issue of my "own" jour-
nal, "Poetics Today" (not the next number, I don't think, but the one after?)
Kalaidjian is pretty good on Perelman, but better on Thirties poets, Fearing &
Rukeyser.  Filreis' prose is VERY reader-unfriendly, but he has found some ex-
cellent material contextualizing Stevens' poetry in the '30s -- more political
than you might guess from the versions that come down to us in his later "Col-
lected" -- so it's worth gritting one's teeth & soldiering on.

sorry to take a bit of a tangent here, but why do you think that such
political conversations in your classroom have deeper implications?

having recently been a student in english 2xx classes, i'm finding that a
HUGE percentage (probably greater than half. particularly now that i'm at a
state school rather than private u.) of students will take certain
political stances mainly out of pressure from the instructor to actually
have an opinion, and immediately outside of the classroom doors will turn
to their friends and say "it's all bullshit anyway."  for a while i thought
this tendancy might be part of some peer pressure not to think too hard,not
to be too serious, and it may be, though i'm not convinced.

don't get me wrong, there are many, many sincere students out/in there, but
i know that many of them/us are frustrated by those that are just there for
the grade.  for me, the main frustration is that i know i'm in the minority
(of even having any concrete opinions about which i've gathered information
and thought about, nevermind what those thoughts might be), and it seems
that the majority of students are not influenced much at all by classroom
conversations.  they're still going to go home and believe what they always
have (whether it's because ma or pa or the kooky neighbor or bob dole told
them they should).  such "political" beliefs strike me much more as
religious beliefs, something that must be taken on faith.

so that when the campaign office windows get smashed out, it's a sign from
Bob that armegeddon is near.

The only time I got a standing ovation for "reading" my work aloud was
when I was a leader (and  Text Meister) for an uprising in the City
Colleges of Chicago against the new chairman of the board of trustees, a
Republican (in Chicago!) hair goods mogul who had inherited the business
but little sense from his dad (although he had gone to Brown--sorry those
of you at Brown).  Anyway, this man of the people wanted to cut 526
classes systemwide in a system serving Chicago's poor, minorities, adult
learners, and immigrants.  He wanted to cut ESL offerings in half.  There
was rumor he wanted to close one of the campuses in one of t he poorest
neighborhoods in the city.  He and friends said, "Students at the U of
Chicago" can't always get the classes they want, and they pay good $$.
Why should our students?"  Anyway, I wrote a speech and read it at the
City Council hearing on his reappointment.  When I  stood up to return to
my chair, everyone was standing and applauding.  I looked behind me to see
who might have entered the room.  (I don't think one of my poems or a
piece of "creative" prose would have received the same response.)  (Our
side lost.  I left Chicago.  The hair magnate still heads the board of the
much trimmed City Colleges of Chicago, where $96 million happened to
disappear in a cronie/junk bond deal that nobody locally seemed to care
much about.  The End.)

Wouldn't a reasonable way to approach this be to consider, first of all,
what constitutes politics and a political statement? Is a political state-
ment a _calling_ - either for change or stasis - within a circumscribed
domain - for example saving an endangered species, upholding affirmative
action? Is this calling inextricably linked to protocol statements,
performatives, such that the statement has an intimate and necessary ass-
ociation with legislative language?

This would extend to a politics of _exposure_ - of conditions, wrong-do=
ing, right-doing.

Or is politics "simply" the placement of personal desire and behavior at
the core of modeling / teleology of the world? This is the "personal is
political" position - what I _do_ is always political; there's no need
to vote for example (although voting could be arguably an "intensifica-
tion" of the political).

In terms of the former, there are political poems and non-political poems.
A political poem would be a call to action (Paul Chamberland) or an expo-
sure (Ginsberg) - in this sense, by the way, there's a relationship be-
tween political and narrative poems. Both operate with trajectories and
embedded descriptions/actions. Both participate in narratological devices.

In terms of the latter, every poem is a politics - just as every poem is a
delineation or fissure of desire, of language, of energy, of body. In this
sense, however, the _poem_ loses a bit of epistemological status, since
every biulding, for example, could be characterized similarly - or every
_political rally._

Personally, I find the latter also an excuse or deflection, an abjuring of
purely political behavior within or without the cultural sphere, since
anything can give one the old pat on the back, you good citizen you.

This brings to mind another old chestnut, "politics is the art of compromise".
Compromise of one's own autonomy "within a circumscribed domain", in the
alligator-infested waters of power.  This is a remarkable post, I think,
but one might ask again, is it a question of either/or or both/and.
Maybe the politics of the personal & politics proper are on a continuum.
Though I think you raise a good question: is a universal "politics of
the personal" actually an invitation to remain on-the-fence, neutral,
detached, or, as the Greeks would say, an [political] "idiot."  - Henry Gould

I like the way you frame this Alan. I would argue that legislative language
does indeed take its cue from "callings" whether from the left or the right
and that most of these callings are shaped by and through appeals to mythic
constructs (e.g. the "myth of the frontier") and mythic rhetoric. The latest
avatar of the  frontier of course is the 21st Century: the coordinates have
shifted from spatial to temporal, but it's still the same bill of goods.

I just listened to a Clinton spot on NPR in which he describes it as a kind
of promised land (talk about yr teleology).  At the risk of sounding otiose,
the flow of power is adjudicated by those who control the language, the
terms of, the dialogue.

So in this context, poetry is the means by which one can, in Pound's
translation of Kung-fu-tse, "bring the sun's lance to rest on the precise
spot verbally," that is, to combat obscuratinism (sic), disinformation,
corporate interest and the rest. Or am I being naive?

Thanks Walter.  Royal is actually a family name -- my middle name, the first
name of my father and great-grandfather (Roy, the only one who went by the
name).  A little of the old patriarchal something-or-other.   Shit I'm tired.

is it ever possible to _not_ take a political stance? i don't
see disagreeing w political beliefs (an individual's or an institution's)
as apolitical. individual epiphanies and overnight revolutions are
historical anomalies in the landscape of politics. if "influence"
is defined more broadly, then every act has some degree of "political"
impact. how do we define a border between what's political and what isn't?
i think jeff hansen made some good points, but to distinguish between
"relevant" and "nonrelevant" political acts is still evaluating actions
with the assumption that some actions have no political relevance. sure,
there are those who will "go home and believe what they always have," but
what's the alternative?

In-Reply-To:  <199610300508.AAA03154@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu>

To All:

The location for the SPITTING IMAGE reading at 7:30 on November 2 has been
changed from La Mama Experimental Theater to La Mama La Galleria at 6 East
1st Street near 2nd Avenue.

=46ull announcement (in case you missed it):

=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=A7=

The following announcement is from Julia Solis. For more info, contact
Julia at: seatopia@bway.net.

THE SPITTING IMAGE is celebrating the release of its new issue with a night
of readings by Raymond Federman, Rob Hardin, Lance Olsen, Peter Wortsman,
Alex Cigale, Colin Raff and Christopher Sorrentino. The readings will be
framed by "pyrotic" performances from Fireplay.  Saturday, November 2 at
7:30 PM at La Mama La Galleria at 6 East 1st Street near 2nd Avenue.

The reading should be smart, fun and informal. Both SPITTING IMAGE and my
forthcoming collection, Distorture, feature Julia--in two mock-forensic
shots by German photographer, Claudia Reinholdt, of Neid--on the cover.
Julia is a writer and translator as well as an editor; both she and
Colin Raff have recently translated Hans Bellmer, my bald muse, into
English. Julia has also translated Nietzsche's last letters,
which were published in _My Sister and I_ by Amok Press. There
is some controversy as to the true authorship of the book (but not the
letters); Julia reports that Nietzsche's letters were extremely difficult
to translate because they were written in the language "of someone who
was ragingly insane."

I don't think naive, but poetry has added its share of imprecision,
obscurity, etc. I think the combat has to be fought in the press,
lawcourt, classroom; I wonder if Richard Dawkins didn't affect the
Pope's rethinking evolution, for example.

I think poetry provides a space to tremble the world and its expression.
(At the risk of being naive.)

see, here's where we get caught up in political trickery.  i'd say yes, it
*is* possible not to take a political stance as long as one chooses not to
engage the context of politics.  i.e., simply not thinking about it (as
opposed to proactively not thinking about it, anyone ever tell you not to
think of a pink elephant?)  however, once a person admits that there are
political plays going down there may be not apolitical position, ignoring
them clearly being political (consent by default) and attacking them being
equally political.

i'd say that those epiphanies and revolutions are the driving forces behind
politics.  if there weren't such ups and downs politics would become
boring, fizzle out.

yes, there will probably *always* be those that no amount of argument can
influence, who simply won't engage in a discussion, but i think what's
important is *why* they won't engage.  as for alternatives, there's all
sorts of utopia....

If you love a particular style of music--any kind of music--I don't
think it is necessary to justify your aesthetic pleasure to other people.
Many people here have commented on their love/lust for Scott Walker--
some of the youngest and brightest writers I know are into _Scott Walker IV_.
But personally, I just don't get it. I can see that he was quite handsome,
but I don't see what's unusually good about his voice, his lyrics or
his arrangements: It all sounds pedestrian to me. But this probably has
to do with Pavlovian professonal bias. For me, crooning 60's and 70's guys
in sharp duds fronting Mantovani orchestras translate to nightmarish
insincerity and triteness. On the other hand, I play and love keyboards,
including synthesizers, which sometimes seem the epitome of nightmarish
insincerity and triteness to others--some of whom happen to love Scott
Walker.

In musical terms, there is nothing wrong with being attached to
George Martin/Beatles-style production. I myself could tell you a
number of reasons why that stuff works: the Lewis Carroll pungency of
the string-vocal-piano arrangement in I Am The Walrus, for example.
There is also a kind of impatient intelligence in George Martin's keyboard
work (on In My Life, for rexample). That, combined with Lennon's dissonant
thinking and tuneful musicianship, can give the Beatles a kind of
cutting quality: the pop equivalent of an oboe-heavy woodwind quintet.
I could go on to tell you many intimate things I know from composing,
and from having to reproduce every note of every part in songs like
"Strawberry Fields Forever," including the backwards percussion.
You have every reason to like that style (though merely loving the
sound of it is the very best reason). It is true that I've heard
enough of that style to last me a lifetime; it is true that I wince
whenever a new band or scene copies the Beatles. But that doesn't
mean you're wrong to trust your ear.

>On another interface, I'd like to just clarify something that Tom Mandel

>Separated by a common language.

It sounds as if popular music might not be the best word for us to use.
"Contemporary pop music" is the wrong term as well, but at least when
you say it no one thinks of Verdi.

There should be a categorical term that encompasses modern folk music,
fugitive music, swinging bachelor pad music, lo-fi networked anything,
meringue, so-called alternative, so-called trip-hop, dark ambient,
polkas, etc etc. But when I try to think of one, I turn into an
obsessive-compulsive surrealist--rearranging fixed and disparate
terms on a hazy lathe.

(Examples: pop apex, tune continuum, panstream, wallpaper madrigals,
skid drift, jackboot swing, automat hyms, prole homophony.
No term seems inclusive enough to mean all that it should.)

Here is the real question: what quality distinguishes what you call
pop music from what we both call classical? What qualities are present
in one kind of music and absent in the other?

-----------------------------------

2. To Dodie: Re Cemetery Man: What do you think ofArgento's films, or of
movies like Diabolique, by Mario Bava? At times, Argento seems far more
interested in texture than plot; at times, plot disappears completely,
leaving another unifying principle in its place, reminding me
(for some strange reason) of Mayhem by Abigail Child.

-------------------------------------

3. To Thomas Oraange:

>A certain amount of the moronic is a staple for much of rock music's
>poetics:

The "moronic" words you're talking about are present in *most* poetry.
They are what Yeats called "numb words" must be there to some degree
to foil what passes as meaning. They seem to stand in paradoxical
contrast to Keats's "load every rift with ore." Yet, strangely,
they are present in the poetry of Keats himself.

Oddly, your example--

>                                [Iggy Pop]

--seems to use numb words in almost the same way (functionally)
as the ballads of Houseman ("When I Was One-and-Twenty") and Yeats.

Even so, numb words can serve several functions, four of which follow:

1. to foreground sound itself, as in Klebnikov's laughter poem;
in Shelley's early drafts of O World, O Life, O Time; or even in
the poetry of Ernest Dowson (the impotence of being Ernest!), in
which static allusions attain a kind of numb allegory to match the
numbing melancholy of the language and the tone.

2. To foreground an anarchic disdain for meaning itself, as in
Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear.

3. To satirize pompous, worn ruts of conventional thought

4. To force the mind to fill in lacunae with something more vivid.

>I would argue that lyrics become poetic primarily in their delivery, which

By delivery, I think you might mean what you refer to as tone. I agree
with you in part, but I don't agree with your conclusions about Iggy Pop,
Jim Morrison, etc. Each case is different; it isn't a matter of one
arbitrary distinction (What do you *mean* Morrison's "delivery" isn't
"poetic?"

This is "poetic," of course, but it also sucks fetid Doberman wangs--
chiefly because of the wretched cliches, vague writing, vacant
imagery and naive inversions

Scan these two excerpts, go ahead.  Iggy gives us a little iambic
>tetrameter,

Actually, Iggy's lines which, conciously or unconsciously, are
playing with the conventional expectations of the popular ballad
both metrically and semiotically, happen to fall into meter far
better than Anderson's alexandrines (except for the fisrt and
last lines). When Iggy drops a beat, he's playing with the listener:

-*|-*|-*|-*
--*|-*|-*|
*-|*-|-*|-*|
-*|-*|-* [forced meter against nonsense words]|-*|

When Anderson's cliched use of alexandrines breaks meter,
the effect seems pointless and arbitrary. The only expectation
destroyed is one's hope that he will get a prosodic clue.

>Anderson pens an almost perfect string of alexandrines.  As
>far as content, the latter is perhaps more poetic, though far less
>intelligible and almost opaque in its aspirations for literariness.  But
>Iggy means what he says and you know it in his delivery, especially when
>he proceeds in the song to let out a series of whoops! and yelps! and
>yrrrowps! that only he can do.  (Nick Cave comes awfully close, as does
>Cobain in his own way.)  In short, as much as I like Yes, Iggy has more
>poetry in his thumbnail than Anderson does.

I don't agree with you at all. If Anderson were perfect, he'd be far less
painful to read or listen to. Also, his tone is as dead as Kant Generator's
ravings. Iggy Pop understands the conventions he frustrates, and his tone
conveys a rich ambivalence.

>Cobain's "a mosquito/my libido" has something Iggy-esquely moronic about
>it, but does it fail as a poetic image?  (Libido is small, pesky,
>displaces blood-as-food with toxin-as-irritant, etc.)

If Cobain's image fails, then so do those of the metaphysical
poets. Cobain is using a wittily far-fetched metaphor (See Donne's
"A Flea") that suggests smallness, ineffectuality, parasitism.
Here again is a rich subversion of various conventions: of the rock
star's gigantic and self-righteous cock-ego, for instance, which
is traditionally rammed into the listener's face. In Cobain's hands
(sorry, I couldn't resist), the phallocentric becomes tiny,
insignificant, vernal.

>Cobain pushes "teen angst" (another rock staple) into a kind
>of unparalleled confessionalism (given what we know about the lengths he
>went to to seek relief for his chronic stomach trouble):
>
>                I'm on warm milk and laxatives,
>                Cherry-flavored antacid.

In a way, this statement is so bland that it subverts the confessional,
he personal, in ways that remind me of Kathy Acker: *You want autobio-
graphical? Here's the dildo I used, here's the Coke can that I smashed.*
Such writers/poets present autobiography in a manner that is so numbing
that the effect is finally to undermine the location of the personal.

>Whatever the merits of imagining Hamlet on a psychotic killing spree,

What do you mean? Imagining Hamlet on a psychotic killing spree is
*highly* rewarding!

For me, this is the best example of poetry you've given: for its
absurd antihero, it has a subverted cultural icon; its style is
lucid (sorry, Charles) and original, it plays with the ballad
ironically (in a way that almost reminds me of Stevie Smith).
It even subverts the narrative itself--not only in microstructural
terms, but even the ending, where the protagonist blows the
author's brains out.

Anyhow, thanks for giving us close readings of lyrics.

On the subject of numb words in a pop context: I'm surprised no one has
mentioned the poetry of Dennis Cooper.

Subject:      Tiger chasing its tail (or tale)

David,

Congratulations and thanks for the explication of that middle name. The
committee had been thinking about asking you about its class stance...

--------------------------------------------

Maria,

why are you publishing in magazines that you admit you've never read?
Isn't academic life alienating enough already?

--------------------------------------------
The question of politics and poetry seems to endlessly cycle into
certain patterns (hence the title of this post) but that doesn't mean
that we shouldn't pursue it. In fact, I take it as a healthy sign that
so many people here are so willing to do so (vast cry from when I was
in college).

I'm sympathetic to Jeff's original blast in that I do think that too
many poets (and others...this is not particularly a poet's problem)
imagine that their "work" (in this instance words) is sufficient as a
political activity. As I once noted in a discussion with Jackson Mac
Low at the old Intersection in North Beach, there is great value in
licking a stamp, walking a precinct, etc.

The problem with a statement such as "poetry is politics that stays
politics" is that it's palpably false. Pound's poetry has proven
"radical" in ways that his politics did not (and in contrast with some
of the Republican right these days, Pound's not off the spectrum,
sadly). Nothing is improved by reifying poetry.

The great difficulty of political action in our time is its
disconnectedness from any sense of effect or power. Reaching people one
person at a time seems like trying to fill the sea with teaspoons of
sand, particularly when you hear that Best (low end discount department
store chain) has decided to go chapter 7 (they've been in chapt. 11 for
years), meaning that next spring another 5,000 people will be jobless.

I've worked within the constraints of the Democratic Party for a long
time because it was evident that 3rd party efforts, noble as they might
be, invariably are self-cancelling. There's a structural bias built
into the US framework that has thus far prevented them from ever
stabilizing. On the other hand, the Democratic Party I envision is Bill
Clinton's worst nightmare (as, in some sense, he is ours).

The very same dynamics that have taken the Dems away from their base in
the working men and women in this country, capital and technology, may
now actually be changing conditions. I do think it is possible (i.e., a
long way short of "probable" but no longer literally impossible) that
3rd party movements could begin and take hold in the vacuum that has
grown. By jettisoning its base, the door-to-door Union volunteer
(capital U), the Democratic party has largely opened up this space. In
focusing in on its base in the fundamentalist right, the Republicans
have done likewise. (As Clinton himself notes, the Eisenhower
Republicans now control the Democratic Party, but many of them have
also just opted out.)

But the problem is this: without a broadly based democratic movement,
too many 3rd party efforts will in fact tap into certain
fascist/populist tendencies. Perot's Reform Party, the Natural Law
Party (which at least wins points for open oxymorons). At the base of
far too many libertarian impulses one finds xeno- and other phobias
just waiting to pounce.

I think Jeff's blast may have been driven by the very same sense of
urgency I have, that without such a movement we are on the cusp (or
well down the slope) into some frightening times. But ultimately, I
think the discussions here, endless and undecidable as they may be, are
part of the solution, not the problem.

Patrick -
I guess I would disagree that legislation takes its cue from "callings"
made of mythic constructs.  I think it's often the other way around,
and in fact both are different ways of dealing with real issues of
power & justice.  The "callings" are just a kind of rhetorical,
persuasive shorthand.  To say that legislation follows them is parallel
to over-emphasizing the "legislative" refinement of language enacted by
poetry (Pound's or others).  Alan's point (I believe) was that new ideas come
from all points on the spectrum.

Subject:      Politics, Poetry and "Political Diction"

At the risk of extending this thread and nullifying my lurking status, and
without seeming too self-serving, I wanted to mention "Political Diction," a
mag which I edited and released a few weeks ago.  Many of the thread
participants -- Mark Wallace, Joe Amato, Jefferson Hansen, Rod Smith --
contributed challenging and at times humorous political commentary.

What I was hoping to address with this issue is the prevailing idea that
politics and poetry don't mix, or rather that poets wish not to mix them, by
offering evidence to the contrary.  I think too often writers "let
themselves off the hook" not in the way mentioned earlier with sayings
like "the personal is political" but by denying that we are striving for any
effect at all.

But back to plugging my mag.  The authors include, along with the ones
mentioned above, Charles Bernstein, Elizabeth Burns, Craig Czury, Buck
Downs, H. Kassia Fleisher, and Andrew Levy.  There's good stuff in
here folks, all in one form or another political commentary, and refutes
the comment that there is no good political writing being done these days.
  E-mail me at my home if you are interested in a copy at
74463.1505@compuserve.com  Thanks for the wonderful discussion
and allowing me to advertise.

ron: i admire very much the insights in your posts, esp the part i deleted here
in the interest of only responding to to part addressed to me.  it's a very good
question, and the answer is, that i usually say yes when i'm asked to do
something (a condition that will have to change) and i was asked by the editor
of jegp --a journal that i had never heard of at the time, but which turns out
to be something my senior colleagues were familiar with --to review first cary
nelson's book and then walter kalaidjian's.  i think they reviewed the books cuz
they come out of u of IL at urbana, where cary teaches and where walt got his
doctorate.  i'm not sure how they got my name but the editor, dale kramer, has
always been very courteous and nice to work with.--md

Is anyone on this list into Scott Walkers' latest album TILT.  I think it's
great.  For those who are not into Scott music,there is at least two
different styles:  The sixties Scott which is orchestrated,dark, and
borders on middle of the road, and the current Scott which is slightly
experimental, with traces of Bowie's Low, with fragmented 'poetic' lyrics.
Keep in mind this is early in the morning for me, and the above description
should not be the only description of his music.  But it is possible not
liking his early music and yet loving his new music. Two different styles.
SO in the long run, give his new stuff a listen,and don't judge him by his
early work.

Ron,

Thanks for the great post. What third party movement are you more impressed
by? New Party? Nader? I've been supporting the New Party which seems a
genuine attempt to get a labor party going, not based around any one
persona-- but long long way to go.

It seems fairly clear that the disappearance of social democratic politics
from the public sphere is strongly related to the rise of television as a
source of "information." What response do you, others, see to this.

rod, i'd say it's strongly *correlated* with the rise of tv (and yeah,
thanx ron s. for that great post)... i mean, i don't see this as speaking
to any intrinsic tv quality, rather to the way the various (and potentially
conflicting) qualities of the tv medium lend themselves (or don't) to
electioneering tactics and strategies...

there's a book on same, right?---advertised on c-span all the time...
haven't had the time to check it out...

but i think the apparent collapse of left and right (into something
ostensibly left-right, unfortunately NOT right-left) IS something to fret
over... hearing dole rant on and on about how he's out to protect 'our
money' aggravates me to no end... it's entirely upsetting and
disorienting---one can't help but turn to the republican candidate (or to
perot) for a more realistic appraisal of our economic times---albeit put to
the wrong ends---b/c one senses that our times are indeed dire... in the
meantime, our democratic prez, in order to get reelected,
justifies---albeit i would argue to better apparent ends---still, justifies
the current economic situation largely through economic balderdash...

so i vote for clinton, will vote for him again... so in effect, i vote for
lies and damned lies in preference to a marginally more truthful appraisal
that itself will be put, as i see it, to the ends of falsehood and *truly*
prevaricating ends... and i'm left hoping that more truth---in the form of
politically desirable public policy that addresses our very real
problems---will somehow thereby result... one almost needs a conception of
'truth and falsehood in their ultramoral sense' to negotiate this stuff
(and i say this with due regard for plato's conception of politics as one
of the 'true arts,' with rhetoric relegated to flattery ('of the soul'))...

Maria's response to Ron raises another set of politics -- closely related
to the first --

There is an academic politics of "where one must be in order to be so
asked" not all that different from some of the poetry mag. biz politics
oft discussed on this list --  My colleagues at Howard University, though
endlessly the recipients of recruiting fliers from colleges they've never
heard of, never get asked to review anything by any of the journals we've
here mentioned in the couple years I've been on the list -=- Nor do many
of my friends at Fill in the Blank State U., no matter what publishing
credits they may have accumulated --

which really just means that we have to be party crashers, always asking
somebody to let us go to the dance with them --

For example -- unlike the poetry reviewing I do -- My last four reviews
of critical books were each the result of the person at the major
research university who didn't want to do it suggesting that the person
doing the asking call me instead -- And not all of my friends have
friends like that who are willing to pass a job along once in a while --

all of which is leading up to my suggestion that as we all age and get
into positions where we might occasionally influence such things, we cast
our nets more widely?!?!?

A.L. Nielson wondered why it is necessary to justify poetry, since it
seems to need as much justification as a heartbeat.

Here's the answer:  in order to argue for the continued existence of
the NEA and its continuing support of poetry.

Organizing to save the NEA is politics.

Hi gang,

        three or four quick points:

1) re the pol discussion: thanks jeff, good blast, thanks everybody for
taking on that most rebarbative of topics. As Ron sez, it is essential
to keep thinking that relationship. & to keep acting on it. I believe
it's a both and situation: the poems & the action in & off  the street
-- alone, neither is enough; which takes an onus off the poem to be
_necessarily, visibly, overtly, contently (contentedly?)_ " political."
Which however does not mean that a poem can be totaslly apolitical
anyway. I just can't. Just as we need air to breath we need the social
to live, & the social is political, through & through, from the
micro-fascisms of daily life (Guattari) to global issues, and that
includes what circulates through the social, i.e. language.=20

Wierdly this line running through my head sicne the thread started, &
dont ask me what it means: "Poetry is politics continued by other
means."

2) here's a www adress to a pretty vast list of poetry ,mags in
Frogland. Some of you may be interested -- Spencer, maybe cld use it to
flesh out his oh so valuable list:

http://www.ambafrance.org/ADPF/POESIE/revu-po.html

3) Let me chime in with praise for Kristin Prevallet's _Lead, Glass and
Poppy_. An absolute pleasure -- an uncanny pleasure; & not irrelevant to
the pol discussion; permit to quote:
=09
                                In the clearing we are all variously forged
                                                                        with official words
                                                                not quite innocent of all
                                                                      that has been broken

4)happy halloween, but rememeber, the  yellow m&m's are spiked with
politics, the read with mescaline.

hmmm, apologies for my apologies, the gremlins were in my machine &
happily only one copy of message went to the list.

however, apologies for what the online layout did to the quote from
kristin's poem; the line should be justified right.

Hi gang,

        three or four quick points:

1) re the pol discussion: thanks jeff, good blast, thanks everybody f=
or
taking on that most rebarbative of topics. As Ron sez, it is essentia=
l
to keep thinking that relationship. & to keep acting on it. I believe
it's a both and situation: the poems & the action in & off  the stree=
t
 -- alone, neither is enough; which takes an onus off the poem to be
_necessarily, visibly, overtly, contently (contentedly?)_ " political=
."
Which however does not mean that a poem can be totaslly apolitical
anyway. I just can't. Just as we need air to breath we need the socia=
l
to live, & the social is political, through & through, from the
micro-fascisms of daily life (Guattari) to global issues, and that
includes what circulates through the social, i.e. language.

Wierdly this line running through my head sicne the thread started, &
dont ask me what it means: "Poetry is politics continued by other
means."

2) here's a www adress to a pretty vast list of poetry ,mags in
Frogland. Some of you may be interested -- Spencer, maybe cld use it =
to
flesh out his oh so valuable list:

http://www.ambafrance.org/ADPF/POESIE/revu-po.html

3) Let me chime in with praise for Kristin Prevallet's _Lead, Glass a=
nd
Poppy_. An absolute pleasure -- an uncanny pleasure; & not irrelevant=
 to
the pol discussion; permit to quote:

                                In the clearing we are all variously =
forged
                                                                     =
   with
official words
                                                                not q=
uite
innocent of all
                                                                     =
 that
has been broken

4)happy halloween, but rememeber, the  yellow m&m's are spiked with
politics, the read with mescaline.

I guess I would relate the (temporary) decline of such politics more directly
to historical changes, I don't see TV as having that much to do with it.
The aging of the Depression/WW II generation, the gentrification of the
Vietnam generation, the triumph of Reaganism as a historic counter to
FDR & that legacy at the very moment when the economy began to outsource
industrial labor, the continuing race divisions & inequality which grew
worse in the 80s on many (not all) fronts...

this is a good idea.  i've done that a coupla times and had it done for me a
lot, i.e. i think often the way i end up doing things is that some hotter shot
sed no but why don't you ask this new person (a woman, too!), maria damon.  i
think coming out of stanford allowed me some opportunities; as that connection
faded, it wasn't till just in the last few years, after my book came out and my
tenure file was reviewed by folks in the poetry network, that there's been a
second wave of opportunity.  now that i'm teaching at a state university i see
the enormous difference in opportunity between what i had and what our students
have; some of them manage to rise above the hardships of teaching overloads,
financial stress and a not-centrally networked institution; i don't know that i
could have.  --md

Any interesting if perhaps reductionistic point. What do you imagine
disappearing with the emergence of online 'information' delivery and access?

Yes, it seems probable that the old precinct system specifically oriented
toward walking the beat was given the ole belly-up by television, largely
because incumbents (house or senate) no longer needed to leave the dome's
backyard either 1. to send the message "back home," or 2. to gauge the
messages' specific effects "back home." Party power was consequently shifted
from cell and precinct captains (points define a periphery) to National
Committees. With a consequent result being of course the devaluation of
constituency as any thing other than the final roll call. In total dollars,
graft and corruption may not have increased. It's just that it's much more
effectively "leveraged." And of course it now takes much bigger players to
join the action.

Henry,

I can dig it. The one-way street notion doesn't begin to cover the
multi-valent contingencies of the process.

However, having just studied the Trail of Tears, or the Removal, as it was
(and is) clinically referred to, I was interested to learn how a shift in
rhetoric/perception made the whole debacle possible, i.e. justifiable to its
instigators. One minute the Cherokee et al are being encouraged to
intermarry with whites; the next, they're being demonized and death marched
off to Oklahoma.

This kind of "transaction" characterizes for me most of what passes for
political "action" i.e business as usual, as opposed to the activism that
Ron and others have been talking about.

I guess I would disagree that legislation takes its cue from "callings"
made of mythic constructs.  I think it's often the other way around,
and in fact both are different ways of dealing with real issues of
power & justice.  The "callings" are just a kind of rhetorical,
persuasive shorthand.  To say that legislation follows them is parallel
to over-emphasizing the "legislative" refinement of language enacted by
poetry (Pound's or others).  Alan's point (I believe) was that new ideas
come
from all points on the spectrum.

A Memorable Fancy (from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell)

The prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how they
dared so roundly to assert that God spoke to them; and whether they did
not think at the time that they would be misunderstood, & so be the cause
of imposition.

Isaiah answer'd: 'I saw no God, nor heard any, in finite organical
perception; but my sense discover'd the infinite in everything, and as I
was then perswaded, & remain confirmed, that the voice of honest
indignation is the voice of God, I cared not for consequences, but wrote.'

Then I asked: 'does a firm perswasion that a thing is so make it so?'

He replied: 'All poets believe that it does, & in ages of imagination
this firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a
firm perswasion of any thing.'

Then Ezekiel said: 'The philosophy of the east taught the first
principles of human perception: some nations held one principle for the
origin, and some another: we of Israel taught that the Poetic Genius . .
. was the first principle and all the others merel derivative, which was
the cause of our despising the Priests & Philosophers of other countries,
and prophecying that all Gods woudl at last be proved to originate in
ours & to be the tributaries of the Poetic Genius; it was this that our
great poet King David, desired so fervently & invokes so pathetic'ly,
saying by this he conquers enemies & governs kingdoms; and we so loved
our God, that we cursed inhis name all the deities of surrounding
nations, and asserted that they had rebelled: from these opinions the
vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the jews.'

'This,' said he 'like all firm perswasions, is come to pass; for all
nations believe the jews' code and worship the jews' god, and what
greater subjection can be?'

Well, now that really is a different question --

rather more like the arguments I have to get up from time to time to
"justify" -- not the continued existence of humanities scholarship -- but
the continued state-supported existence of humanities education -- and
the requirement that all students have some of it --

I do not believe that I have to justify my being alive -- I do not
believe that I have to justify my writing of poetry --

I may very well have to justify the claims my writing might make upon a
public --

And I might very well, as I have often in the past, have to justify my
belief that public monies should in some small way support the public
life of poetry in these United States --

which continues to be a harder case to make than the giving away of huge
tax subsidies to people who get rich from sports arenas --

It would be nice, for a change, to be able to mount a convincing and
effective threat to move my poetry to another city if the one I now do
business in doesn't re-seduce me with millions in write-offs and other
inducements --

A defense of poetry may be included in a defense of the NEA subsidy of
poetry, but it is not the same defense --

As indirect response to Eryque, I'd suggest that classroom discussion
like the reading of a poem 'might' have subtle but deep implications.
These might include beginning to think politics not as religion
(in the sense of unwavering faith) ....  The shattering of windows
works now only as a poetic image; and, it should be noted, at the
time the image was not picked up by network TV or NPR in its coverage.

Has there been social democratic politics in the U.S.? Harold Stassen. But
since then?

I heard Dole on TV a few weeks ago; he was using the word "liberal" as if
that were a comminly-understood pejorative. Has it really come to that in
the U.S.? I mean he was saying liberal the way that US politicians used to
say "communist."

I am not a USAmerican (though I was, when a lad, planning to become one),
and there are many things I dont understand. But here's a tough one. What
about (the public) Jefferson? Was he a liberal? What about the U.S.
Constitution? Was it not seen as fairly liberal in its time? Are people
like this Dole against the U.S. Constitution? Do they say so?
