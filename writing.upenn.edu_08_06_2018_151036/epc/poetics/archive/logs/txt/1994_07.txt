Subject: Warren Tallman

We've had the sad advice from his family that Warren Tallman died yest-
erday (July 4) in Vancouver, British Columbia, thankfully at home and
without difficulty.  It's hard to imagine the present fact of Canadian
poetry and its relation to our own sans the immense effort which Warren
Tallman made in his years as a teacher at the University of British Col-
umbia, and, even more, as the indefatigable reader and friend of all the
defining poets of both countries.  In 1962, for example, Warren's students
at UBC included Daphne Marlatt, Fred Wah, George Bowering, Gladys Hind-
march, Lionel Kearns,and David Bromige, among many others.  The landmark
1963 Vancouver Poetry Conference was almost entirely Warren's remarkable
invention, bringing together for the first time a decisive company of then
disregarded poets such as Denise Levertov, Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg,
Robert Duncan, Margaret Avison, Philip Whalen and myself, together with
as yet unrecognized younger poets of that time, Michael Palmer, Clark
Coolidge and many more.  Be it said that Warren wrote the first decisive
piece on Jack Kerouac's skills as a writer, "Kerouac's Sound," published
in the Evergreen Review.  Donald Allen and he subsequently edited together
POETICS OF THE NEW AMERICAN POETRY, a crucial backup of Don's initial anth-
ology which, seemingly, changed everything.  Warren's two substantial col-
lections of essays report and review the tenets of poetry which underlie
the revolution he had so much to do with.

All that can finally be checked out.  What will be sorely missed is the
singular insight and invention Warren brought to his relations with poetry
and poets.  He was a great reader, a great, great heart.  Defined by the
American Great Depression, he believed absolutely that books mattered,
that what people can think of and so imagine is true, that it can really
happen.  So it was that he brought Robert Duncan first to Vancouver, to
talk with his students in a series of meetings, all managed by the money
they could themselves modestly and communally provide.  Jack Spicer's last
articulate lectures were fact of the same circumstance.  I was able to
teach for a year at UBC at a time when virtually no other job was possible,
just that Warren BELIEVED.  I cannot overemphasize the significance of such
a power.  It's as if Warren brought not only the US and Canada together in
such interests, but that he really brought western Canada's poetry into the
international world it now helps to define and keep possible.

Well, this can be the beginning, I hope, of what can now continue as
Warren's work: bringing it all home, keeping the beat, making that joyful
sound.  Warren loved the sense of "mother tongue" always.  He really knew
how to listen.

Here's to you, brother, forever.

                                                      Robert Creeley

The Electronic Poetry Center (Buffalo)       7-10-94

________________________Announcement________________________

THE ELECTRONIC POETRY CENTER (BUFFALO).  The mission of this
World-Wide Web based electronic poetry center is to serve as
a hypertextual gateway to the extraordinary range of
activity in formally innovative writing in the United States
and the world.  The Center will provide access to numerous
electronic resources in the new poetries including RIF/T and
other electronic poetry journals, the Poetics List archives,
a library of poetic texts, news of related print sources,
and direct connections to numerous related poetic projects.
The Center's first phase of implementation is scheduled for
August 1, 1994.  A subscription to the E-Poetry list
provides a subscription to the electronic journal RIF/T and
E-Poetry Center announcements.  Subscriptions to E-Poetry to
listserv@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  Inquiries, suggestions for
Center resources, submissions to RIF/T, and other mail may
be directed to e-poetry@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu  The Center is
located at gopher://writing.upenn.edu/11/internet/library/e-
journals/ub/rift  (Presently, the prototype is under
construction but operational.)

     Gopher Access:
     For those who have access to gopher, type
                   gopher writing.upenn.edu
     (or, if you are on a UB mainframe, simply type wings)
     at your system prompt.  First choose Libraries &
     Library Resources, then Electronic Journals, then E-
     Journals/Resources Produced Here At UB, then The
     Electronic Poetry Center.  (Note:  Connections to some
     Poetry Center resources require Web access, though most
     are presently available through gopher).

     World-Wide Web Access:
     For those with World-Wide Web or lynx access, type www
     or lynx at your system prompt.  Choose the go to URL
     option then go to (type as one continuous string)
          gopher://writing.upenn.edu/11/internet/
          library/e-journals/ub/rift

___Participation in the Electronic Poetry Center (Buffalo)___

For those interested in helping us build the Center, our
goal is to provide a single Internet site that offers a
doorway into the different poetic projects out there in the
electronic (and paper) poetics world.  We would like to
offer access to information about poetics and poetry
activities, electronic poetry journals, texts in progress,
etc.  We are currently developing a library of electronic
poetry/poetics texts (submissions to e-poetry@ubvm.cc.
buffalo.edu).  The Center has other exciting possibilities:
     1.   Circulation of electronic journals with an
emphasis on direct links to those of relevance to Center
concerns;
     2.   Reviews of recent print and electronic
publications.  (Brief reviews may also be submitted
electronically to e-poetry@ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu);
     3.   Direct links to other related electronic sites;
     4.   Multimedia resources.  Sound and graphics relating
to poetry.
     5.   Building our Small Press Alcove, a place for
little magazine and book announcements.  The point of
including announcements of paper resources is to provide a
listing of interesting work for people to look at; they can
then write or e-mail the publisher to obtain publications.
(Send announcements to lolpoet@acsu.buffalo.edu or
magazines/books to Loss Glazier, E-Poetry, P.O. Box 143,
Getzville, NY 14068-0143);
     6.   Ultimately, the Center could also offer
collaborative projects (perhaps for specific groups of
writers), lists and/or archives of other lists, and texts-in-
progress, as things develop.

The "Buffalo" in the title of the Center is not meant to
suggest that this activity is limited to Buffalo, only to
give the "visitor" a sense of place, i.e., where the
mainframe that's providing this service is "located."
Vigorous writing wants to "circulate."  On this new
electronic terrain, the Electronic Poetry Center will serve
as a gathering place or point of entry for a range of poetic
efforts.

______________________How to Contact Us_____________________

Please contact us with your suggestions, texts, sound files,
and graphics files to submit, or if you have expertise in
these areas.  LET US KNOW WHAT YOU THINK (this is meant to
be a Center that grows with your ideas) by posting to this
list, sending mail to E-Poetry, or to Loss Glazier (lolpoet@
acsu.buffalo.edu) or Kenneth Sherwood (v001pxfu.ubvms.cc.
buffalo.edu) privately.

Chris,

Knowing you, I am inclined to enroll in your imaginary university (department
of incidental poetics)--but could you perhaps dilate ever so slightly on
what you're up to?  I post this to the general list, rather than to you
directly, since others may be as puzzled and intrigued as I am.

Thanks.

Steve,

   Hope all goes well in Providence.

   Up to a bunch of things. It was someone else
who kicked this new/sletter into gear -- accidentally, of course --
then, energy being what it is in addition to our ALWAYS READY stance --
well, you can decide for yourself what it is & isn't as reposting this
week's edition below (apologies to those who are on the direct list
ALready) -- next week's version will feature a scathing rebuttal by
marianne moore to bhs's course description among other things.
   We all have our peeves regarding university curriculae, here is a
place for I or I to begin again. As usual, a myriad of editors handling
the materials...

   We welcome all contributions/suggestions--           paz--

Subject:      Citation for Golding on Anthologies?

If anyone has it at their fingertips, I need to be reminded
of where Alan Golding published an article on the history of
poetry anthologies (in 20th-century U.S.).

I'm hoping to get a little perspective on the Messerli,
Hoover, Weinberger collections, as well as to push along
some work I'm doing on the use of group anthologies by
the Objectivists, the New York School, and the language
writers.  If people have suggestions beyond the Golding

Alan Golding: "A History of American Poetry Anthologies."
     _Canons_. edited by R. von Hallberg.
     Chicago, Chicago UP 1984, 279-308.
You might also find useful a long piece I did as Appendix to
     _Dictionary of Literary Biography_ Vol 54: American Poets
     1880-1945 [3rd series part 2] (Detroit: Gale, 1986), 579-676
     "A Survey of Poetry Anthologies 1879-1960." This is an annotated
     list preceded by a brief discussion of trends. It reprints a
     number of prefaces and introductions (eg _Active Anthology_)
     and the Tables of Contents, but unfortunately omits (permission
     to reprint was withheld at the page-proof stage) Zukofsky's _An
     "Objectivists" Anthology_, which thus gets appallingly and
     undeservedly short shrift. The "Survey" does not (overall)
     include textbooks.
          I also discuss briefly the fortune of some of these (and
     some text-book anthologies) in the general introduction (called
     "Foreword") to Vol 54, Part 1. This foreword also appears in Vols
     45 and 48: _DLB: American Poets &c_ 1st and 2nd Series, and was
     reprinted in slightly revised form [with full documentation]
     in _Sagetrieb_ 9.3 (Winter 1990): 7-29.
          There's lots more on all this stuff *somewhere*, but right
     now I'm in the throes of packing for a three week vacation
     starting tomorrow (today, where you are). If you want more,
     ask again around 5 August when (MAYBE) I can lay my stupid
     hands on my scattered notes. But Alan Golding will have
     answered you by then, surely. He knows more than anybody.
Cheers,
Peter Quartermain

I figure I ought to be qualified to respond to this one. The essay is "A
History of American Poetry Anthologies" in Robert von Hallberg's edited
collection Canons (Univ. of Chicago Press 1984): 279-307. A revised and
updated version with some material on Weinberger and Hoover will appear as the
first chapter in my forthcoming From Outlaw to Classic: Canons in American
Poetry (U of Wisconsin Press early 1995). I have an essay in progress called
"Approaching the Present in American Poetry Anthologies" that deals with
Weinberger Hoover et al and with mainstream anthologies since the mid-1970s.
If anyone's interested in the updated book chapter or the work in progress
(I've given the latter as a talk so it's in more or less readable and coherent
shape) just drop me a note; both pieces have notes/bibliographies that might
suggest further resources. As regards the recent anthologies I'm sure there
are a ton of reviews that I don't know about (a mini-bibl. of reviews for
those anthologies would actually be a useful project for someone to take on)
but the exchanges in American Poetry Review are lively: John Yau's original
review followed by Weinberger's response and Yau's response to the response;
and Burt Hatlen reviewed the Weinberger collection in Sagetrieb. So Steve--you
might look at those pieces if you haven't already done so.

Thanks to Alan, Peter, and the several back-channel saints who
responded so quickly to the query I posted yesterday.  I am
again awed and a little humbled by the capacity this medium has
for instancing acts of generosity.

I agree with Alan that a mini-bibliography of reviews of the
anthologies would be useful for many of us on this list: should we
agree to volunteer whatever information we run across in our indiv-
idual researches?  If people are afraid of cluttering the band with
multiple posts of the same information, I will  volunteer to receive
mail on the subject and post updates for the list  as new sightings
warrant.

Let me know if this sounds like a good idea.

Best to everyone.../Steve

Sounds like a good idea to me.  I have recently been fascinated by the
way that polemical anthologies, ones including sustained academic essays
as well as "in your face" wishes and fabrications, made the Harlem
Renaissance.  But then this has always been the case.  Whether or not they
sold or did the job intended, such projects do, in retrospect, mark
recurrent modernisms variously named.
Enough of that shit.  Eh?
Let me say that we are in an excellent position with our new electronic nets.
We can turn retrospects into prospects and nullify the need to apologize
even as we meta-anthologize.  What fun.  Hope it isn't rude to be ironic.
I am not, in any case, being ironic.  I will be as helpful and/or quiet
as I can in the anthology and other projects.

Thanks to Steve's question, a gratifying convocation of replies; to which I can
add my own take on Weinberger --as set off against McClatchy's *Vintage Antholo
gy*-- forthcoming in *American Literary History*. That essay constitutes the
final chapter of my book *The American Poetry Wax Museum* (& a belated thanks
to Charles's plug on this list earlier in the summer); but in the wake of the
Hoover & Messerli collections I'm planning on reconceiving that chapter in
August as the book goes to press. So any discussion that unfolds here between
now and then will not only be welcome, but duly noted in the result (I have yet
to see biblio-credits for e-mail discussions in print, but surely they've happe
ned & there must be some unfolding protocol).

Just for everyone's information: the Clayton Eshleman essay that Pierre Joris
refers to is "The Gospel According to Norton," in American Poetry Review,
Sept./Oct. 1990: 33-41. And yes, watch for Jed Rasula's forthcoming book--a
mine both of useful information and analysis thereof, including on virtually
every post-World War II anthology published.

Still, one might keep in mind one small detail about the "economy" of
anthologies:  the law of diminishing financial and intellectual returns
to the poet(s).  It would seem that inflation also a/effects
the reception of anthologies.  To say nothing about Pound's anthologizing,
his criticism and competition in this (fallow and/or easily penetrated)
field of the market.
In short, nothing more on anthologies. . . .

Hmmm--

Well, Klindberg, that's fine except that anthologies are frequently used for
the purposes of "recanonization" by the very people who would like to see
the "opposing" canon debunked. One cannot have it both ways. But consider that
poetry magazines may serve a greater purpose directly due to their perceived
limited shelf life. Anthologies--while retaining some nostalgia value for those
who wish to revisit their intellectual youth--are stagnant pools attracting
little more than mosquitos, while journals are more indicative of the actual
state of literary life; i.e., there is the assumption of impermanence, and
everyone is forced to keep on their toes. I prefer to sort out the interesting
from the mediocre on my own, thank you. If I must have my literature filtered,
I'd rather depend on a greater number of editors than a smaller number of
agenda-toting anthologists to provide that service.     Regards, Marc Nasdor

        Now that we're fully assembled and have adjusted our headsets for
color and vertical roll, I'd like to invite anyone with an interest in
literary biography to contribute to a two-volume series that I'm editing
for the _Dictionary of Literary Biography_ (Gale Research Press) on
American poets after 1945.  So far there are some fifty entries in
progress, including Brett Millier on Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Bertholf on
Robert Duncan, Tom Gardner on John Ashbery, Miriam Nichols on Robin Blaser,
and Mark Scroggins on Louis Zukofsky.  Entries range from 5000 to 10,000
words.  The entries are literary biographies, but the principal focus is
the presentation and appraisal of the poet's complete work in chronological
fashion.  All contributors to the volume receive an honorarium from the
publishers, a copy of the volume, and offprints of their entry.

        I'm particularly interested to hear from anyone willing to write on
David Antin, Amiri Baraka, Clark Coolidge, Louise Gluck, David Ignatow,
Kenneth Koch, Adrienne Rich, Jerome Rothenberg, or Ron Silliman.  I'm open
to other suggestions, assuming that the poet is appropriate to the volume
and not already assigned.

        If you're at all interested in contributing, please respond to me
personally (i.e. off-list).  I'd be happy to answer any questions you might
have about the project, or take suggestions for subjects and/or
contributors.

Thanks.

Well, in as much as it is a point worth making, I believe that was something of
my point.  The realities of classroom teaching at universities such as
my own raise the issues of anthologies with a certain urgency, or so it is
thought.  My irony--whether caught, missed, or intended (Ah Ha)--was in some
fashion motored by why the greatest activity I have seen for some time on
this network was centered around questions so market driven.  Wouldn't  it,
then, be more interesting to talk about the market than the anthologies?
Or is that what we are doing?  Please feel free to respond in anger or pique;
such responses please.  Anyway, really, I do mean that, while one is interested
in the production and distribution of anthologies, other poetic(s)/political
issues might be more pressing.  I apologize for any, if not all, offenses.

Question for Joseph Conte.  I ask this one over the net, since it might
prevent a flood of repetitions of the same question.  Just to be helpful, as
is my nature, if you will.

What do you mean by American?  Do you seek info. on poets from the Caribbean,
perhaps even those who find themselves morooned, as 't were in the US?

Will this volume update, supersede, articulate with, say, the DLB volume
devoted to the Beats?
I guess those are more than the promised "question."  I didn't mean to be so
helpful with irony-ing.

I think Kathryne's bemusement about the sudden  activity here on
the list around "questions so market driven" is on the whole well
placed.  It may be that the anthologies--which will not, I suspect,
break too many sales records--raise as a question something we
otherwise take for granted: namely, that poetry's resistance to
integration through the market, its failure as a commodity, is one
of its decisive, albeit negative, attributes.

Meanwhile, though their economic effects will be minimal, the symbolic
effects of these anthologies could be quite formidable--the legitimation
of the language writers may in fact have reached its apogee with them (for
instance). One thing I find myself thinking about is how little these
collections have risked by way of recasting the *form* of the anthology:
a patent contradiction considering how much of the work included is by
poets who sought radical transformations not only of poetic but also
cognitive forms.  This fundamental conservatism makes the utility of
each of the volumes dubious to me even in terms of classroom use.  I don't
want to romanticize the practice (time-consuming and often difficult) of
making xerox-anthologies, but as someone who was taught, and now does teach,
from them, I don't envision the new volumes individually or in combination
offering a better alternative.  I would, on the other hand, have liked to
see something such as McGann has done with his Oxford volume of Romantic
Period Verse, where one witnesses something of the unfolding of a field
of practice in history: neither Weinberger's thematic editing, nor Hoover's
conventional birth-dating, nor Messerli's combination of the two, seem very
soundly motivated to me.  (Even Allen's, at the time controversial, clustering
of movements drew on principles of division that were at least deducible from
the immanent organization of the poetic field at the time.)

I am open to the criticism that my judgements here are a little hasty, given
that I've not owned a single one of these volumes for more than two months and
have certainly not read even one of them in their entirety (has anyone? will
anyone?).

Finally, a thought experiment that owes a little to Ron Silliman's remarks
in "Canons and Institutions: New Hope for the Disappeared": what place would
these anthologies have in the curriculum of an instition that--unlike the ones
most of us work in, for, or near--was autonomous and deeply committed to the
real possibilities (past, present, and future) of poetic practice? For while
the form and contents of these books can indeed be defended as *compromises,*
I think it is of vital importance to weigh these compromises, which after all
take a lot out of one, against the prospects of transforming the situation
so as to make them unnecessary.

First, regarding "the 'economy' of
anthologies:  the law of diminishing financial and intellectual returns
to the poet(s)"-- diminishing from what? Is there a place of undiminished
financial returns to poets?

And I am surprised to find no nod or reference to anthologies such as the
recent special double issue of o-blek (one volume on technique, the other
on practice, which is in effect an anthology), and the recent The Art of
Practice (Potes & Poets). Both of them seem to me anthologies which want
to push something forward, rather than documenting the past (although that
could be argued, as the latter does publish works which have been
published previously, although mostly in the last couple of years). Are
these anthologies less valuable than the works by Allen, Messerli, and
others mentioned in this discussion? I don't think so.

Anthologies are like our institutions of literature. It's hard to live
with them, but also hard to live without them. But is it hard to outlive them?

        Steve Evans brings up the conservatism of the new anthologies
vis-a-vis their form.  Having scattered my attentions across the Hoover
and Messerli volumes, I'd venture to add that, while they may represent
"a new American poetry" (the subtitle to Messerli's anthology), they
don't necessarily represent a new America.  Messerli's volume includes
Baraka and Mackey, who are included as writers who, with Inman, Child,
and Darragh, "all work closely with genres that explore sound/music/
voice relationships" (33).  They are not included among the poets who
are concerned with cultural issues (group #1), or those who focus on
issues of self (#2), or those who are engaged with "language, reader,
and writing communities" (#3).  Such thematic groupings are intriguing,
but many, if not most, could be included in all of them.  This is just
a guess, but it sounds to me as if the groupings were developed to
describe writers, rather than emerging out of a wide-sweeping survey
of the 1960-1990 frame that Messerli assigns himself.

        Hoover's anthology, organized rigidly as it is by birth-dates,
comes a bit closer to "looking like America."  Hoover includes
Hagedorn, Yau, and Berssenbrugge; Algarin, Baca, and Cruz.  I wonder
if the term "postmodern," which is both a descriptive and an historical
term, allows him greater leeway.  At any rate, while I hardly want to
subscribe to an arts-by-numbers scheme, I also want to see a wider
range of experiences (both historical and aesthetic) represented
here.  The Heath tried to broaden the range of ethnicities welcomed
into the American canon, but failed miserably (as I guess everyone
knows) at challenging the hegemony of free-verse.  Where's the
response?  While I seldom teach with anthologies, to dismiss them
totally seems utopian--many university courses do use them.  I would
think twice about using these anthologies in a Hawaii classroom,
though I'd happily recommend them to students as partial portraits
of contemporary American poetry.

I agree with Steve Evans, and I would like to add a comment.

Since there is little market for poetry, in the conventional sense of "market,"
I would suggest that anthologies have no market outside of poets and a
dwindling number of students. That fact, however, does not totally destroy
their value.

But as for me, I would prefer to receive my anthologies with loose, unbound
pages, so I could chuck the crap and keep the cool stuff. You want to empower
the reader, right? :-)

The "hegemony of free verse" you refer to is simply a reflection of time
marching (or goose-stepping, as you might refer to it) forward. The problem
is that most of the interesting rhymed & metered verse is being written by
songwriters. I'll take verse from the Residents, Iggy Pop, or Kurt Cobain
for that matter, over volumes of mindless drivel from the likes of an R. Wilbur
or R. Howard.

In answer to Mr. Klindberg's useful questions regarding the volumes on
American Poets since 1945 that I'm editing for the _Dictionary of
Literary Biography_:

Although it may sound parochial, the senior editors of the series
have decided to treat Anglo-Caribbean writers and Canadian poets
in separate volumes.  There are always exceptions, especially for
instances in which the poet is born in the Carribean or Canada but
has spent the major portion of his or her life in the US.

This volume is actually updating and superseding _DLB_ 5 on American
Poets since 1945, edited by Donald Grenier (1980).  It may overlap
in a few instances with Ann Charters two volumes on the Beats, in
part because the careers of several of the poets found in her volume
were never strictly identified with the Beats.  Perhaps, after the
big Beat reunion in May in NYC, Charters will update her own volume.
So there may be new entries on Allen Ginsberg (if someone's so
inclined) whose work was addressed in _DLB_ 5, or Paul Blackburn,
who appeared in Charters' volume but was more closely associated
with Black Mountain.

In both instances the membrane's semi-permeable, and I'm rather
open to (private) negotiation.

Thanks for your interest.

Susan Schultz's distinction between a "new American poetry" (Messerli via Allen
: & I continue to be amazed at the hero worship Allen inspires almost 35 years
later, as Messerli, Hoover, Weinberger, & Silliman's *Tree* testify) and a "new
America". I think on the one hand of Emerson's phrase "this new yet unapproacha
ble America"--from, I believe, the essay on Experience--taken by Stanley Cavell
 as the title of a book; and on the other hand, think of Jose Marti, and his
 quite different & unEmersonian experiences as a Cuban journalist in NYC in the
 1890s, struggling to certify "nuestra America" in the expansive sense I think
Susan is speaking of. So I note, with both curiosity & apprehension, the announ
cement in the Viking catalogue for Fall, an anthology edited by Maria Mazziotti
Gillan & her daughter Jennifer: *Unsettling America: An Anthology of Contempor
ary Multicultural Poetry*. --does anybody know the editors, or know anything of
this project??-- this is touted as a book designed to "displace the myths and
stereotypes that pervade our culture", but I have a hunch it doesn't do much to
displace the fastest growing myth on the cultural horizon coming into the 90s,
which is the uniformity of the white male. Which is not to say that white males
haven't had a couple centuries (in the USA) to create a diversified self-portra
it (in various convexities); but the very "selling points" of this anthology
are a portent of an ominous but it seems inexorable social fact, that nothing
gets valorized except by a corresponding devalorization-by-caricature.

Jed Rasula's comments about the "myth of the uniformity of the white male" are
right on target, but I might qualify  somewhat. Outside the arts and academic
communities, these issues used to barely generate much interest. It is worth
noting that it has been papers such as _The Wall Street Journal_ which has
brought this issue into the mainstream.

BTW, I've just returned from a month in Hungary, and I cannot overstate the
degree of puzzlement exhibited by young Budapest intellectuals concerning the
subject of political correctness. They think the Americans are retarded. But
maybe that says something about the former.

Jorge:

What Hungarians find wrong with political correctness is undoubtedly that
p.c. is the first step on the slippery slope leading to neo-puritanism.
I've been hanging around with many Hungarians for the past decade
(in fact, I'm married to one). And what I can tell you is that Hungarians
like to enjoy themselves. They like to cook and drink and fuck and let their
kids run around naked at the lakeside beaches. Those to whom I spoke on the
subject of political correctness, however, sometimes posed inane hypothetical
questions, such as: "So, if the woman *successfully* slept her way up the
corporate ladder, could she later charge sexual harassment of those former
superiors, for her own personal gain?" This was enough evidence for me to
conclude that mainstream Budapest intellectual circles were receiving their
information from rather suspect sources, probably the mainstream American
press. :-)
    I would say that sexism and harassment are as prevalent in Hungary as in
the rest of the world, but it's probably more out in the open, and I think
that less and less Hungarian woman are willing to tolerate standard macho b.s.
I've heard plenty of horror stories from my wife about her treatment by male
superiors when she was teaching gymnastics in her twenties. At least the
Hungarians aren't totally hypocritical, like many French intellectuals, who
will claim of sexism in France that "we've already solved that problem," which
as far as I'm concerned is a lot of hooey.
   As for other issues, multiculturalism, for example, the Hungarians usually
claim that they are the embodiment of multiculturalism, being descended from
seven or eight different nationalities stretching far into central Asia. Of
course, try telling that to the Gypsies, who are treated as pariahs, to put
it mildly. One gypsy family in a department store has everyone clutching their
wallets with an iron grip.
   What can I say? We live in a screwed up world. In any case, political
correctness in the USA has been demonized as a bourgeois pasttime.
Unfortunately, discussions about such issues as spouse abuse, as well as
gender-related issues, rarely include members of lower socioeconomic groups,
whose members are affected is much greater numbers.

Well, maybe, but they also think that American intellectuals take themselves
*way* too seriously. Can you blame them? How many examples of Hungarian
fiction, poetry, drama, or criticism ever make it into English. I think many
intellectuals writing in "less popular" language groups feel their works are
constantly belittled by the "imperialist" languages. They are correct.

Marc,

from *Hungarian Anthology*, Pannonia Books, Toronto, '66

(the truck of the existential anti-imperialist editors is evident here in
this mostly male-dom; but it's the only Hungarian anthology I have. What a
nut to fit my knowledge of Hunagrian poetry into, or what a *small*  book
to get it from....

From Anna Bede's "Ode to the Dishwater" (no date given)

Dishwater,
you daily gathering!
What are you making from the salad's green,
from the golden meat, from ash-colored fruit?
What do you do with the screaming of the tender finger-grabbed silverware,
engine-rumbling, painting, struggle of tuneful words?
How do you dissolve the changing to a man,
the leisure majesty of feasting,
the sparkling faith of working days?
You are like the jealous earth
Which only can dissolve and cleanse when she kills,
and falling in her pit, insects, leafage, fruit and men
become united and unrecognizable.


In many ways the anthology this fragment comes from is itself compost in
this dishwater; that its ideological choices are informed by the themes,
the forms, the conceits; that its picture of Hungarian poetry is messy, a
messy remnant - particularly now. Anna is one of three women collected here
and *I* chose this fragment; itself a messy, and could be construed as
ideological, choice. (Another - "I Am The One" - is much more clearly
marked out as an *anti-war* metaphysics.) -- In many ways we engage in
literary history and not poetry at all....
Of the many questions I'm raising in this post, foremost is how, or is it
possible to be updated by another Hungarian (or by any) anthology?
Anthologies are beasts one sleeps with while clutching a knife under the
pillow. I have the knife; is there one that I could try with?

Thanks for the posting, Pat.

Hmm, unfortunately there's not much of interest in English. You might look at:
_Modern Hungarian Poetry_ (New York: Columbia University Press, 1977)
The Hungarian issue of _Translation_ from the mid-1980s
An earlier issue of the _Five Fingers Review_, which includes poems by one
of the more interest younger Hungarian poets, Endre Kukorelly, translated by
Sandor Andras, a professor at Howard University in Washington. Interested
Hungarophiles and others can write to him c/o the German Dept. there; or
at 9007 Sudbury Rd., Silver Spring, MD 20910. Tell him I sent you. Thanks

The rest, alas and alack, are dull mainstream academic translations of
Agnes Nemes Nagy, Sandor Weores, and Istvan Vas (all recently deceased elder
poets)

        I have the unhappy feeling that my posting led somehow to
a discussion of "political correctness."  That term, and its
benevolent confrere, "multiculturalism," tend to obscure debate rather
than open it up.  The commercialization of "multiculturalism" (CNN
advertises itself internationally as having a "multicultural" staff)
comes to mean that we have "anthologies" and "multicultural anthologies"
as if the two were necessarily distinct from one another.  My
argument for the inclusion of ethnic diversity in the former comes
out of the experience of teaching in a place where 90-950f my
undergraduate students in most classes are non-Caucasian Americans.
At that point the debate over political correctness seems frivolous,
and the need to diversify one's reading lists becomes a matter of
pragmatism rather than idealism (or, if you're anti-PC, a stain on
the traditional canon).  But I don't think Hawaii's alone;
California is becoming a state with no ethnic majority population.
Doubtless others will follow.


This is not to say there isn't resistance here, too.  There is,
and it makes life in the UH English department interesting (in
the sense of the Chinese curse: "May your life be interesting").
And my syllabi are often top-heavy with members of the old
canon.  But I wish we could talk about these matters without
using the show-stoppers, pc and multiculturalism.  We might at
least talk about what "multicultural" might mean in a productive
(and not in a commercial) sense.

A few very minor points in response to recent flurry, if I may.

1) to M. Nasdor--If members of socio-economic under-class
are not part of our (?) conversations, how can we know that they are more
affected by spousal abuse, etc?

2) S. Schultz--The point about saving productive thought and/or work
from commercialism is, of course, well taken and shared.  However,where
do notions of "productivity" come from if not directly--or even reactively--
from the Market?  one market or another?  Expensive whole food markets,
which tend to be quite p.c.;little broken down markets that sell lotto
tickets and beer by the can; open subsistence markets in India; the
commerce in ideas over emergent media, etc....

While it's no fun to pun about m/Market(s), it's worth recognizing some
of the slippages from, say, high to low culture and sacred to profane
(literary/literal?) property.  Oh, anyway.  By the way, I teach in
Detroit, where it seems to be rather clear that "multiculturalism"
and "cultural criticism" can too easily be an evasion of Race and Class,
which are stunningly practical (Praxis) issues--even for the few theorists
left at the front guarding their rear(s).  Charges of p.c. can work same.

Kat:

Even if the socio-economic underclass (let's not leave out the culturally
working class) were less plagued by spousal abuse, etc., it is clear that
they must be somehow brought into the conversation. Do you think that *only*
members of the upper and middle classes should be subject to (re)educational
efforts on behalf of all women, minority groups, children, etc. Surely one
cannot count on the moral Trickle-Down Effect to apply here. Try working on
Wall Street for a while: I can assure you that you'll run into people from
a wide breadth of backgrounds, most of them incredibly ignorant of even the
subject of these discussions. These people--and most of "Middle America"--
are precisely those who American left intellectuals have been taking for
granted in recent decades. These are also the same people who are never
exposed to innovative art works, experimental poetry, film and music from
other cultures, etc. There is one whopper of a cultural revolution that never
happened in most of America in the 30+ age group. Maybe grunge culture has
made deeper inroads among the twentysomethings than all the poetry or p.c.
jingoism will ever hope to accomplish.

sorry to be so tardy in replying--mounting a gallery exhibit
(which opened friday) which included a 1300 item catalog...
your original post seems to have sparked some discuss, much
missed from the list of late.  my own rantings:

anthology, from gk "collection of flowers"--neatly labled and
pressed into a book, no longer living or fragrant, nor allowed to
go to seed...

looked at in the most sceptical light,the urge to anthologize
seems to me an attempt at ownership, a beating of the bounds
which not only defines but claims rights to a territory.  that's
the sense, for me, in which it's an attempt to canonize--to
control what is or is not allowed in, what is legitimate to
consider.  i have to think, given the power of the Norton
anthologies in general, that Hoover & the editors there _must_
be consious of that side of it; inexcusable if not so.  & too,
putting the thing together as a product to sell, obviously not
just the commodity of an individual book on the shelves but a
perspective, actual capital value in a (praps corrupt) cultural
market.  that's the "commodification" angle.

i think, for the others (Barone & Ganick, o*blek, Sun&Moon),
there's a bit of an embattled sense, in which they feel they
must struggle against that entrenched power structure, either
to storm the gates or at least to define & defend their domain.
those alternative practices & poetics i am much committed to,
but i'm not sure that adopting the same tactics is the best
agency for advancing the cause...

         wanna be the next don allen.  wanna out the next
         _in the american grain_ (such an important book
         to me--& maybe moreso 'cause i got it fr a buck
         in the remainder bin...)

this is all very largely overstating the case.
hyperbole that i all too often believe.


i appreciate having the chance to read other editor's selections,
reading the editing as well as the selected work.  telling, fr
instance, that the Hoover is arranged by chronologic date of
birth--nothing about the work itself, but centrally about the
author--as arbitrary as any, i suppose.  the author-ity of the
editor, tho, is i imagine not something most students will be
aware of--and there's an arguement in favor of the "illegal xerox
packs & personal anthologies" you mention, which are so obviously
the selections of an individual...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

a plug here, for the initial issue of "Chain" (spring summer 1994,
"Special Topic: Gender & Editing", edited by Jena Osman & Juliana
Spahr; $7.95 to 107 14th St., Buffalo NY 14213).  A _crucial_ piece
of work.  from their "editor's notes" (without permission):
"Relation:  Perhaps a good starting point would be to discuss my
apprehension about editing.  I am uncomfortable with the idea of
the editor as arbiter of good taste, or as the (in)visible
navigator/sculptor of a final packaged product.  Journals rarely
seem to openly admit the presence of personal ideology behind
their pages.  And when they do, the "personalized" frame seems to
stifle and alter the work by mashing it into an overly-prescribed
space.  We all change what we read in the very act of reading;
however, editing forces an external median strip between the
substance of the original and what it will become.  Such mediation
can create a powerfully dialogic space; it can also create a
"culinary" space that limits the possibilities in the act of
reading.  The _Chain_ project is an attempt to investigate the
(im)possibility of an unmediated reception, the (im)possibility
of detaching a writing from its presentations/ideological form."

     (& yes, i(ronic), male, select this particular excerpt for
      this particular space...)
     (wondering if the (coincidently male) editors of the
      anthologies under discussion might have some awareness of
      these concerns)...

-----------------------------------------------------------------

so what does an anthology teach?  that literature is a dead thing
(again, the flowers pinned down & labled); that you (reader) can
rely on someone else to distinguish for you what is important,
what is not.  (too bad "discriminate" has lost some utility--of
course it would be _evil_ to "discriminate against" something; so
instead we are indiscriminate); & that it has no context.  the
anthologist trots out a string of "good" poems, demonstrating
their power & virtue--& by extension poems that are "like" those
are "good", ones that are "different" must not be.  profoundly
conservative.

why not teach a few "bad" poems?  teach from the struggling
journals (we could use the business), let (make) students hunt
thru and make their own choices.  for the cost of the Norton (aww,
 quit raggin' on them...) you could choose a half-dozen "slim
darlings" & really get into a poet's work, the best and the not-so
(once got an order frm a univerisity bookstore for 50 copies of
one of our chaps; made my day for a week).

     "1805 W. Taylor in Ann. Rev. III 651 It ought not be said
     that any aanthologist can strrip the garden of its flowers."
                 (i love my OED--so optimistic; & so well edited)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

so, that's my rant, or a bit of.  as fr TRR:
our (thee editorial "we"!) main goal is to provide access to
material, descriptive over evaluative, and as above encourage
the reader to make her own choices.  a brief survey, say a
paragraph or 2 on each of a half dozen, plus a few paragraphs
to contextualize (raise some of these questions, not neccesarily
lay down the definitave answers), would be a valuable contribution.
hope you'll consider.

Well, I've finally managed to retrieve 58 messagesfrom my other
Eudora) system at Stanford via my computer in Los Angeles.  But I
haven't figured out how to send it the other way yet.  So let's see if
it works on MCI.
A few comments:  in all the discussion of anthologies, no one has
mentioned that the odd thing about Hoover, messerli, and Weinberger is
that they feel obliged to buttress the present with so much of the past.
Don Allen, after all, really did do the New American Poetry.  So why
do these anthologists begin with Olson or the Objectivists, etc.?
Stuff that's 30 years old or 40.  Do we feel too little confidence
that we can pick the New American Poetry.
As for the Multiculti issue (brought up by K. Lindberg, Susan
Schultz etc), I think much more of it will kill off any interest
in poetry anyone might have.  Poetry isn't written by quota.  Gays,
for example, have always been way overepresented--the leading poets
at many periods of history have been, say, 60 % gay.  Now if we have
to go by quota, where does that leave the poetry of Hart Crane or
Auden or O'Hara or Ashbery or Schuyler or even Whitman and Dickinson?
Secondly, the sort of thought police to be found in John Yau's recent
rant is really counterproductive.  Whatever one thinks (thought0 of
Eliot W's anthology, this sort of head count can't work.  There will
always be more groups, always those not represented, etc. etc.  Why
does every group have to write poetry to begin with?

Dear Marjorie and K. Lindberg and others:

        It seems to me that there has to be a middle position here;
to argue for "multiculturalism" does not necessarily invoke the
thought police, or John Yau.  I do think it's worth asking whose
interest in poetry is deadened by such discussions (and that, I
suppose returns us to the question of community); as K.L. and I
have noted (and I'm sure people are getting sick of hearing me write
this), multicultural syllabi are often more a practical, than an
idealistic--or cynical, if you will--concern.  That's why readings
by white male mainland poets average fewer than 35 members in
the audience, and why readings by prominent Asian-American writers
can easily attract several hundred here.  Audiences do matter, and
I'd like to see them overlap more.  The problem with multicultural
anthologies is, to my mind, that the creation of a "multicultural"
market may tend to reaffirm the differences between audiences.  What
I'm suggesting is a blending of that large group of white male
gay poets (or whoever's in the statistical ascendency) with other
voices.  I'm not talking essentialism, but experience here.  It's
not that all groups should write poetry, but that individual members
of all groups, for whatever reasons, do.  I appreciate the fear of
quotas; I feel it myself sometimes.  But there are unconscious, as
well as conscious, quotas.  Why else would 98% of the University of
Hawaii English department be white, in a state that has no majority
group?

Enough huffing and puffing by me.  Back to Honolulu's humid squelch.
I hope others are cooler.

In response to Susan Schultz:
you're right, Susan, I was just sounding off because I did find John
Yau's attack on Elliot Weinberger especially irritating and disingen-
uous.  But you'r right: if I taught at Hawaii, I would certainly feel
a responsibility to have plenty of local (or Asian-Am or Asian) poets
and not just white males.  But I think that's less a question of
ethnicity in general than of local pride, isn't it?  The feeling of
always importing things from the mainland?  Anyway, I'm looking forward
to my Phi beta Kappa visit next January and see for myself, never having
been to Hawaii.
All very complicated!

Subject:      Yau's Review

For Marc and others who may not have seen it, John Yau's review
of the Weinberger volume appeared in the March/April issue of
American Poetry Review.  The current issue of the APR (with Joe
Ceravolo on the cover) includes letters--all of them hostile to
Yau--from: Weinberger, Esther Allen, David Hinton, Forrest Gander,
Roberto Tejada, and Cecilia Vicuna. Yau is given space to respond
to each letter.

[What follows are some thoughts, composed rather late at night, that
can certainly be passed over by anyone who is growing tired of this
topic.]


My gloss on the exchange in APR is, I regret to say, rather negative.
I hope it won't sound cynical when I say that *credentials* seem more
at stake than substantive issues.  This is not to argue that credentials
are *not* a substantive issue in the politics of representation, but it
is to admit a certain weariness with the American reflex of personalizing
important debates (e.g. Weinberger's calling Yau's review "a nervous
breakdown in print," &  other examples too numerous to mention).

One interesting note: Yau wrote exactly the review Weinberger had apparently
been having nightmares about while preparing the book (see his defensive
"note on the selection" at the front of his book, with its Malthusian ref-
erence to a "population explosion" in recent poetry apparently contradicting
the denigration, several pages later, heaped on those who "count heads" or
maintain "police-blotter files on individual poets".)   That the "Very
Brief History" of "American Poetry Since 1950" is more than an apology for
the editorial decisions of the book I also take to be incontrovertible.  Had
Weinberger admitted that his description is *historically* accurate for the
period between 1950-1965 (or 70 at the latest), and then only for a very
specific (and indeed, very significant: cannot specific and significant
be thought at the same time?) group of writers, there would have been a lot
less room for misunderstanding.

My point here is: Weinberger and Yau are playing two sides in a single game,
a game in which "marginality" has been converted into the stake and highest
honor even by intellectuals who feel few of its withering social effects.
I would suggest that we wean ourselves of "marginality" and consider more
seriously the values and meanings of "specificity"; that we, further, dis-
abuse ourselves of illusions that, historically, avant-garde formations have
been drawn from any class other than the dominant one, and that in the U.S.
that class has been and continues to be white; and finally, that positions
in the economy of literary canonization have any *direct* correspondence to
positions of social power.  I hope that it is recognized that the latter two
points go together: drawn from the dominant class does not mean loyal to it.
The avant-garde hasn't had, by any means, the monopoly on oppositional
cultural and political practice in capitalist societies; but it has had, at
various times, important links to oppositional social movements and to the
intellectuals who inevitably emerge as such movements progress. Vexed, con-
tradictory, seldom studied in any detail, such links might be the basis for
an anthology neither Yau nor Weinberger, nor for that matter Michael Harper
(*Every Shut Eye Ain't Asleep: An Anthology of Poetry by African Americans
Since 1945,* $13 from Back Bay/Little, Brown), have yet imagined.

One last note: Erica Hunt's "Notes for an Oppositional Poetics" has been
mentioned on this list before, but its relevance for this discussion seems
worth noting once again.  It is published in *The Politics of Poetic Form*
(Roof, 1990).  Cary Nelson's *Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry
and the Politics of Cultural Memory* (U Wisconsin, 1989) also is useful here,
especially with respect to the way class, and class struggle--two things
that identity politics and official multiculturalism cannot recognize--
were once vital, generative, categories of poetic practice in this country.

I apologize for the length of this post; as usual I couldn't resist the
opportunity for discussion this list represents to me.

Regards to all,

I for one can't remember the last time I bought an anthology for
personal reading.  I evaluate them as textbooks for survey courses,
trying to anticipate their appropriateness for a fairly disinterested
group of largely blue-collar students here in Buffalo.  I order an
anthology because my students can't afford a long reading list, and
so they get a wide selection at one low price.  I used Codrescu's
_Up Late: American Poetry Since 1970_ in a class on Contemporary
Literature (along with several pbk. novels).  Antin's talk poems
and Judy Grahn's lesbian odes were the surprise hits; much other
experimental work was largely met with stoney silence.  I actually
looking forward to trying out Hoover's book next spring.  I think
the poetry has to move the audience, regardless of race, gender,
or sexuality.  If gets them talking about something other than
the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football, it's a success.

Thanks to Steve Evans for his relevant posting. I look forward to rereading
Cary Nelson's book. I just have a couple of points to add. First, Steve, I
think that it's a bit disingenuous to say, in 1994, that the dominant class
"has been and continues to be white." That sounds like a statement by someone
who never gets off campus. I'm a freelancer and I have been poking my nose into
many types of work and social situations for a long time. I can guarantee you
that the dominant class--the "middle" class, the class to which we're
referring--is well represented by non-white members, who spend the same amount
of energy as white people hypeing the dominant culture--capitalism, know-
nothingism, the general conservative ethic, etc. I think that for domestic
politics in the present and future, race is and will be a distraction, and I
don't think that the community of "alternative" poets and writers will ever
really come together, to make definitive cultural/political action, until it
recognizes that *class* was/is/will be the central issue here. I don't know,
people seem to go out of their way to avoid talking about class. I wrote this
posting because of the way you ended yours (making reference to the fact that
identity politics and official multiculturalism cannot recognize class and
class struggle). I think you contradict yourself.
    The second bone in my throat: your inference that "credentials" may be a
substantive issue in the politics of representation. Steve, that's why we
love the Net, because it frees us from such emphemera. I have no idea what your
credentials are, and I couldn't give a flying Flinstone. We should all be
grateful to be alive to see the crumbling of the priesthoods. We only have to
be vigilant enough to watch out for new ones.

Subject:      anthologies...

for alla this talk contra anthology, which i do 'preciate & understand, still:

1. if somebody wanted to anthologize my work ("me") i'd be tickled pink...
perhaps i wouldn't feel this way after countless such 'events'... on the
other hand, i think it would be an Immensely Satisfying ego-massage... some
of you who have had the dis/pleasure can comment here on this---do it feel
as good as it looks?...
2. as i think it were john fowler pointed out, the net represents to those
with access places to distribute foc... use at your own in/discretion...
for you academics out there (like moi):  this will of course not help your
tenure case in any causal sense (as things currently stand)...
3. what "counts" as an anthology in poetry is perhaps a different
construction (say, in historiographic terms) than similar compendia in,
say, fiction...
4. let's not gloss the less-than-scholarly-and-entirely-human tendency to
want to see one's friends families oneSelf in print, side-by with other
perhaps more famous names... i refer here to the tendency for editors to
plain & simply play faves... which is simply an extension of any such
editorial stance (& it happens ALL the time)... which is again one rather
obvious reason why ANYTHING gets published in the first place, whatever the
merit...
5. anthologies, as a few folks have suggested, are useful in pedagogical
terms... if you make your own you're not necessarily more
disinterested---the impulse may very well be precisely the same...
luigi-bob's comment re purchasing five or six 'little books' strikes me as
on the mark... yet there do seem to be a need now & again for some sweep,
some 'representational' grid of who's who in institutional terms (& in
accord with one's sense of institution)... anthologies are texts... that
is, they have contexts... they are not static, they emerge (jed & alan &
____ are probably most familiar with this argument) against a specific set
of cultural exigencies... hence they oughtta be used in light of this... if
intro'd this way, anthologies can be seen as the normative constructions
they in fact are...
6. & of course, back to emedia, what of the digital-form issues at stake in
this process of amalgamating?... we take work composed with pen pencil
typewriter wordprocesser & lord knows what new software, we convert it to
print-bound matter, & we publish accordingly... perhaps this seems a moot
point---to those who view these letters as just that---but i find it more
problematic in poetry than, say, in publishing paperbacks of victorian
prose... owing to my sense of things poetic, attention to formal
constraints etc... & because there has been for some time now, all over the
net, ongoing discussion of dislocations slippages etc. as a consequence of
emedia, alphabetically speaking...

so so... just some random noninklings, bubbling up through...

Just a couple of quick points in reference to Marc's post.  I take
the point that whites no longer monopolize the exercise of domination,
though I don't happen to share Marc's view that the middle-class
is "dominant" in the national or the global economy.  I invite Marc
to provide an explanation for the "whiteness of the avant-garde" that
is more solidly grounded than the one I gestured towards.  In schematic
terms I simply tried to suggest that: avant-garde cultural production
tends to be an option in the universe of subjects socially positioned
nearer to economic power; as the terms of access to that power get
redefined, so will the terms of access to the avant-garde project.  I
draw this inference from looking at the composition of actual avant-
garde formations since the mid-nineteenth century, but I will be the
first to rethink the position if people present good reason to do so.

On the question of "credentials": here I'm afraid that it's your turn to be
disingenuous, Marc. I was explicit in my criticism of turning credentials
into the central point of contention in the Weinberger-Yau debate.  However,
as a geniune set of questions about tradition underlies the manic debate about
Canon, so a genuine set of questions about competence underlies the debate
about credentials, or so I would contend.  The bridge term in each case
seems to be institution(s), since they convert traditions into Canons and
competence into Credentials.  But perhaps I overestimate, here at my
university-subsidized internet link, the importance of the institution?

As for the crumbling of "the crumbling of the priesthoods"--please don't
mention it to Salmon Rushdie, since such comments must tempt his patience.
The "old" ones are still here, and there are new ones in addition to that.
As Andy Levy remarked in a series of posts several months ago, the Net
itself is, more likely than not, one of these new ones.  There is plently
to be vigilant about, agreed, but not only up ahead.

For a study on the "objectivist poets" in preparation for DIU
Press I would appreciate any anecdotal information (including
letters, photographs, first person accounts or copies of memoirs)
that would shed light on the brief marriage of Lorine Niedecker
and William Carlos Williams.  I am also seeking information on
Joyce Hopkins, in particular the circumstances that brought her
to reveal "Louis Zukofsky," "Charles Reznikoff" and "George
Oppen" as Niedecker's pseudonyms.  Lastly, if anyone knows the
whereabouts of Robert Creeley, I have been trying to track him
down.  I understand he is the last living member of the original
"objectivist conspiracy," and that he went into hiding shortly
after the coup but remained within the borders of the old United
States.

CLASS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR "AMERICAN POETRY"

What does it mean to be an American?  I have presumed to regard this
question as an historical one.

Yet Marianne Moore suggests our historiography lacks something in the
way of truth.  Do you agree?

In the way of truth stands history itself, blocking the light.  History in
the form of an author casts its shadow on our reading.  What to do?

As we begin our reading of Whitman's "Drum Taps," let's presume to imagine
that Whitman himself is listening in on our conversation.  Can we provoke
him into stepping aside, that the light might return to the page?

The dark is good to dream in, but to dream in the light is better still.

"He comprehended that the effort to mold the incoherent and vertiginous
matter dreams are made of was the most arduous task a man could
undertake, though he might penetrate all the enigmas of the upper and
lower orders:  much more arduous than weaving a rope of sand or coining
the faceless wind."  (Jorge Luis Borges)

Let us recall the Kent State massacre.  What was at stake?  Why
was the National Guard shooting down middle-class young
people in middle America?

Their ancestors were enthralled by the utopia sublime.  Right
there in Ohio, in Akron and Cleveland, they were in the thrall
of the absolute.  So utterly were they taken up by what their self-
repression might gain them that, when the Cayuga River
caught on fire and burned, they did not understand that it was
a sign.

The children were lured by beauty--forms that were available to
the senses, not crumbling between a lost origin and an
infinitely receding goal.

I or I would recall the virtue of Herbert Marcuse in this
connection:

"Before the court of theoretical or practical reason, which has
shaped the world of the performance principle, the aesthetic
existence stands condemned.  However, we shall try to show
that this notion of aesthetics results from a 'cultural
repression' of contents and truths that are inimical to the
performance principle.  We shall attempt to undo this
repression theoretically by recalling the original meaning and
function of aesthetic.  This task involves the demonstration of
the inner connection between pleasure, sensuousness, beauty,
truth,  art, and freedom--a connection revealed in the
philosophical  history of the world aesthetic."

I think Steve Evans has come up with a useful formulation: that institutions
convert traditions into canons and competence into credentials. You could also
say that institutions *define* competence as the ability to convert traditions
into credentials. In the end it comes to the same thing: who gets accredited to
speak on behalf of, and in the name of, others. The anthologists' familiar ploy
of gesturing towards the contents and saying "the poems will speak for themselv
es" is an old ventriloquist stage trick. I'd welcome a return of the old mode
of the commonplace book (the last author to publish one that I'm aware of was
Auden), in which a patchwork of citations pretends to be nothing less than (in
Emerson's term) "colossal autobiography". Where all this gets wearying is in th
e overinvestment, on the part of editors, in the pretence that a "community" or
a "tradition" is somehow being preserved--which is not the same, by the way, as
the case (like Allen's NAP) of an anthology inaugurating the conditions for a
community that only retrospectively identifies itself in the past conditional,
which is precisely what Weinberger, Hoover, and Messerli propose to do: "if we
had been there all along, 'we' would have ended up looking like this."

The Trouble I had with Poets


What I remember about the poets and the trouble I had with them was
first the time Anne called and I picked up the phone and said Anne,
knowing it was her. But Bernadette said that I was involved
with Rosemary to get closer to Vito and Vito had told Rosemary I was
a pest, which he also told to Dara who Vito told me was a pest. In
short order, pests were everywhere. My ex-wife went to Bernadette's
ex and there were fights all around. Keith seemed to put up with me
and once when I was crying around midnight told me I was a real artist.
Jackson saw the tape that Kathy and I did and said it took courage.
Meanwhile Vito saw the tape and said I wan't a real artist and Laurie
saw the tape and said I was. Allison went up to Kathy by the way and
said she was married to me and Kathy told Allison I was crazy. Rosmarie
I don't think ever liked me although I liked her with a great aplumb.
Meanwhile David just about stopped talking to me and Aram thought I
should focus more and was just impossible. Clark and I talked all night
long early on and I owe him for that, but I felt used and abandoned
towards the end. When I first read Allen that was all the Allen there
was, but Dan told me that Vito said he never wanted to end up like me.
Still Alan told me I wasn't as arrogant as he had heard, and Krister
hated me for reading Lacan until later when she read Lacan and more,
according to Henry, and then just hated me. So anyway, I.A. said I had
surprising talent, orphaning me, and quite a few years later I saw
Robert stand up, which I had not seen him do before, although there was
no reason for him not to do it. I fell in love with someone who lived
with Diane probably because she lived with Diane or maybe she didn't.
I published Michael in some early work, and Robert wanted to publish
my translations from a langauge I didn't know. I am never sure about
poets, about these poets. Poets trick me a lot and I always fall for the
same old things. Susan always walked around in her underwear and it did
tricks on me. And like everyone else, George had severe doubts, but Tom
at least published some things as bad poetry. Now I look back and see
that I should have listened to Peggy, but how was I to know the differ-
ence between heroin and heroine? Ed wrote all too well, and Charles I am
sure had his doubts, although Karen wrote America's greatest unpublished
poetry. Ed was never particularly supportive, part of a group I viewed
with jealousy and dismay. I could never believe in anything after hear-
ing all of them, reading all of them - I could never believe in poetry
ever again, including my own; I can never use `poetry' without shudder-
ing. I get suspicious of poetics which always seems to invoke Charles or
someone like Charles. If not Charles, William or Robert, all those
anglo names coming in from small-town crater America. Always I wonder
what the rest of the planet and the other Roberts are up to, and more
and more identify with Violette Leduc and her malaise. I have weaned
myself from aphorism or metaphor, rhetoric or the bon mot that gains
a pause, a witticism in a foreign language. I am a pariah for the poets
if they even remember me, a nuisance or a pest refusing to settle down,
half-male, half-thing. I doubt they remember me or would care to if given
the choice. They were the troubles of my life.

GOD

I am a fifteen-year-old girl who is also a fifteen-year-old boy and
I have both a penis and a pocket to put it in. And I have no hair
there yet so I can see myself when I put it in and someday I will
have a baby because my friends have babies. I will have a baby soon
and I know this because I am always wet because I can do things to
myself.

But I don't sleep very good and I always think about God and I don't
think that God really cares for me because she is a he and he can't
give birth to anything because he doesn't have a pocket. And it
doesn't make sense that he would make a pocket because if he could
do that he could make himself like me and I don't think he would
like that.

But I don't think God really cares for anyone either because what is
the point of all those prayers just thanking and thanking him for
everyone's misery because they really don't like anything that's
happening to them, that's for sure. So if he did care then he's not
so powerful because he's a he and because he doesn't seem to do
anything about it. And if he wanted to do something about it and
didn't then he wouldn't be very good, he would be evil. I would hate
to think that God is evil but I just can't thank him for anything.

Besides, if God made everything, then who made God? I think that
people like the idea of God coming first because God is something
like people, even weak like them, and I think that weakness making
something is better for people than strength making something,
especially if it's strength they don't have. But anyway, there's this
to think about, that God would be made by people, because people
would want to make something not like them at all, but different, but
not so different as, say a mountain. So I think that God would be
just different enough to say that he is there forever or doesn't have
to obey the rules, and I think he doesn't even know what the rules
are.

So if he doesn't know what the rules are, then what is the point, if
you ask me, for God, because why not just let things alone, and if you
need something to let things alone, then you are living in a dream
because there is nobody to tell you to stop touching yourself. And if
I stopped touching myself down there, I would never have a baby.

(Oh, I forgot to tell you that I love to tell you about myself because
I know you love to think about me touching myself there and it will
make you forget all about God who will never punish me because he will
be busy with your prayers and everything and will never know.)

KARL KRAUS COMPRESSION MACHINE


"There are writers who can express in as little as twenty pages
what I occasionally need as many as two for." (Karl Kraus)

To force a rhyme which, lying on its back, flounders
All legs, thrusts the loss of hope and energy
Against the sun or moon, as if a tendency
Returns this spatial clot upon its back.

Tendency is towards, and not to mix a metaphor,
Which I won't do, is towards something which
Is not where it could be before the tendency,
Such as fascism, for everything

Flies on the surface of an enormous rope
Pulling its own weight behind its legs, dull gleam
Ahead, as if something were there, which it is not
Or rather, the fleeing tendency of time.

You might have known I write beyond the speech
Of which ridicule has barely parted, continuous work
On subject and its objects, of nothing in that space
Beyond the names. This beyond is my written leg,

Just one, falling everywhere beside the point,
Crippled in every direction, but there at least
A gesture in every direction, which I am not against.

The mechanism on the left contains a _cylinder_ with a spherical
bearing held in place. An arm extends from the bearing with an
attached secondary arm at right-angles. Even with a limited
degree of rotational freedom, the secondary arm is capable of
alignment with any given point in three-space.*

Playing fields are drowned by words or dreams because
They bend, rip, are torn asunder, sodden, dull, because
They are not there but made from sentiment, because
Death works hard on them, returns a loss become a loss because
Victory is a young girl or boy hard upon a playing field because
The field is all their world laid out before the names because
The names don't amount to much at all because
They're not there, and nothing is intended because
The boy and girl are dead and no one plays there because
Playing fields are drowned.**

"How much material I would have if nothing happened!" (Karl Kraus)

*To penetrate the labia of god is perfect harmony, writing played
out against the lips of god murmuring of afterbirth.

**The fearful world. The terrible language. The sun a brilliant red.
The Romantic _blue deer._ The violence of cement.

Ah, in relation to some response to _submission,_ yes, I was aware of
the masochistic tentation of the word which was deliberately poised
above the three... _submissions_ and is not my usual heading - in
other words, _submission_ is part of the contents of the posts which
begin after all in their heading.

1. If the dog won't let go the trouserleg, it must taste good.
2. Anthology - bunch of flowers - a selection of "choice" items, in
   both senses. I choose these, because they are so wonderful, and I
   want you to have them. There's no way around that. It's up to
   readers to tell us which they like (sorry, no way around that,
   either).
3. Oh sure, most anthologies are terrible; I mean, it's one person's
   taste, and in the kingdom of poetry - an absolute monarchy in
   which each one is monarch, subject to none, and none a subject -
   you start by having a completely different view from everyone
   else.
4. Yes, institutions and committees and all other formations of
   professionalism manipulate, mold, warp if you like the mirage
   which is our view of the art at this or any time, but there is
   no better committee to substitute, and such a substitution is
   all I see offered, not just in this debate or on this forum,
   but most (a polite formulation for damn near all) the constructed
   social critique is a demand for allocation of space to *my* brand
   of frogs in the existing pond. Viz. the only alternate university
   herein discussed proclaims itself imaginary: here's where I would
   drive if I had a car. But the only valid critique of a form of
   life is a different form of life. A poem can answer a poem,
   naught else. Nor is an alternative link equal to an alternative
   community. If you are a grad student or a professor, start a
   different university to teach something different.
5. Sometimes an anthologist is lucky (it is always better to be lucky
   than to be smart), viz. Don Allen. But, no one (perhaps Jed R.)
   has pointed to the social context of Allen's anthology: people
   living and doing something evidently and definitively different
   from a prevailing life. The authenticity of the anthology - which
   needed to make no self-eliminating "argument" ala Weinberger -
   was in the stuff. (I don't at all mean that Don Allen was lucky
   *not* smart, by the way, just that he was fortunate to be faced
   with such a potent task to which to commit his smarts).
6. The same operations which enable a canon and credentials enable
   the critique of that canon. There is a struggle for power and
   life and space and the crowning of these in a sense of worth
   for what one has done and chosen. If the canon we debate arose
   because the classical languages were moved out of the center
   of education (i.e. worse housing = bigger bombs), then what
   would happen if we all read greek again ((don't get me wrong,
   it doesn't have to be greek, just a horizon and to replace all
   this margin-making wch replaced a sense of the horizon and its
   beyond))? But, we will always be empowering something larger and
   more abstract than the works we read, and will furiously unmake
   the beds we refuse to sleep in.
7. Grad students, quit school. Professors, resign your jobs. Talk
   about "avant garde" formations, that'd do it. Is a university
   a place where new art has traditionally formed (credentially
   formed)? Of course, if you have a family to help support (or
   you'd like to), then... just as you were, keep up the good
   work. But, can we move on to another topic?
8. Somewhere near Pittsburgh is a small town called Harmony; it
   began in a utopian gesture sometime near the middle of the
   19th century. I turned toward my Dodge Dart toward it one
   day in I think it was 1973, but when I arrived it was a dim
   steeltown suburb black with oil and soot of the rivers that
   mingle thereabouts to (at the time) carry away what was not
   wanted in making the steel. I'm trying to remember whether
   I've ever looked at a map and seen a town called Rhyme.
