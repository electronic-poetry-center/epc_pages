Hi Damian,

I think that if someone really does read Benchley, Geng, and others, they'll
find "difficulty, paradox, thorny symbolism, the delayed payoff," and even
"the sense (as Rene Girard put it) that criticism [though more like "a
reading" in humor's case] completes the 'implicit or already half-explicit
systems' at work in the text." But humorists, unlike most of us poets, don't
wear their art on their sleeve--they tend to hide it. Or when it's not being
hidden (difficulty is difficult to hide), it's being turned into a joke
(critiqued). But for most of it, you'd really have to tease it out (as
opposed to making a gesture of teasing it out, which is really what I
remember happening in the lit classes I took--many people (kids, even!)
seemed already to know what was going on, structurally or formally or
whatever, probably from reading criticism/Cliff Notes about whatever was
being read in class, or in any event seeming to already have been previously
indoctrinated to whatever it was being closely examined), especially as most
humorists don't seem particularly interested in writing explanatory essays
about their art, or that of their friends & colleagues. Why not? Because
there isn't much going on formally? Not at all--there's a lot going on
formally. It's not just about examining/critiquing culture--that's just one
of (& the most obvious of) humor's surfaces. We aren't (necessarily) meant
to see all of that formal/structural stuff in humor, all of the playing with
sonics/resonances, multiple meanings, nuanced repetitions, etc., etc.,
because the end result is supposed to be taken in (at least on first
reading) "all at once" (much of it subliminally, I'd argue) and seem
"natural" and "seamless." But it's not. No more than "L,M,N,O,P" is a
naturally occuring causal series. A humorist who doesn't pay attention to
form--above & beyond the cultural "content"--probably isn't very funny. Or
particularly engaging.

Maybe one reason na cGopaleen etc. are not taught by lit professors is that
there's not much written explanation of any of their art--as art--to crib
from and/or send students to. Or that, because there's this paucity of humor
criticism, it doesn't seem as legitimate as, for instance, Joyce. Isn't
criticism a kind of television of the arts? Like, if it isn't written about,
wasn't "on TV," so to speak, it didn't really happen? I dunno. I'm very
biased about this, but I think that, for instance, na cGopaleen is a far
better writer--more of an artist--than ... well, okay, I'm not going to make
some ridiculous comparison. But, point being, there are probably more books
written about Bulwer-Lytton than on na cGopaleen's Irish Times column. And
I'll bet five bucks there are more classes where Bulwer-Lytton's books--or
Reagan's speaches, for that matter--are read.

I think it was wonderful what you said and I will continue to think so long
after the dust has met the last sentence, which is even now part of the

I participated! I mercilessly stole a kiss from my husband, although I
can't say he seemed overly dismayed by the theft, and then I stole a nap!
Is that good?

Actually, I'm surprised that this having been Thanksgiving, nobody has yet
raised the palindrome which leapt out of the dim depths of my memory:

Gary,

I love Benchley, but I don't agree with you about his
subcutaneous complexity. (Never heard of Geng so I can't
comment on that.) What I was trying to get at before is
that, if you try to account for why something is funny,
you're treating form as something that produces a kind of
immediate charge, and situating that in the
culture/audience rather than in the text -- so that to
explain why Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny in
dresses you'd have to talk about gender in the 50s or
something -- oh, I don't know, of course you could talk
about the performance of gender in that case, and then you
could get into a fairly detailed formalist kind of
analysis, but you'd still be closer to a cultural studies
than a lit crit model. Ditto with humorous texts, I think
-- they aren't canonical, so only cultural studies
approaches can accomodate them. I'd stick by *why* they
aren't canonical, once again emphasizing that this is an
observation, not a critique of humor or a defense of
difficulty. I have no personal stake in the fact of a
canon, as long as I still get to teach poetry instead of
Reagan's speeches. (I've taught visual culture, which I
found surprisingly hard to do -- kids even in their first
year of college have the expectation that TV and popular
magazines don't belong in the classroom -- an expectation
ironically conditioned, no doubt, by misguided pop-cult
representations of college teaching.)

Which brings me to my second point: I don't want to get
into the academy/anti-academy thing if I can help it. Aaron
asked about "pure" humor *in the canon*, and I take it as
read that by "canon" we generally mean "what gets academic
sanction." Believe me, Gary, "we" debate these things ad
nauseam, so it really ain't like there's some cabal of
profs that says "Joyce, yes" and "Flann O'Brien, no" (in
fact O'Brien is taught quite a bit these days -- Irish
studies being a growing deal -- so no doubt somebody *has*
looked at the journalism things). There IS, of course, the
fact of institutional inertia, a fact I was trying to
account for in talking about New Critical difficulty as a
litmus test for canonicity. Also there's the curious
process by which the very varied pursuits of the "academy"
(far from a monolithic thing, especially nowadays) get
sifted and shifted so as to constitute the curriculum, also
not a static thing, but one that seems reflexively to boot
out such things as this panel proposal from the latest MLA
newsletter: "_Dumb and Dumber_ and Beyond: Why Are
Gross-Out Movies Popular (1990s to the Present)?" You'll
see this as an MLA panel but (probably not) as an
undergraduate course. This proposal comes, by the way, from
the American Humor Association, whose other offering for
MLA 2003 is "How Humor Reflects Culture: Humor Magazines,
1950-70."

Best,
Damian

White Noise

Pressured groups throughout the government lead to a tightening of worldwide
financial controls. "with a wink and a nod" we are pressing Saudi Arabia to
monitor Islamic charities to make sure that contributions do not go to close
babies. An Italian terror doctor said on Tuesday a woman pregnant with a
terrorist was due to give birth in January, but declined give any details
about her eating habits.

Worldwide scientific communities have challenged statements in the past that
women pregnant with terrorists are among us.Doctors and scientists reject
terrorist cloning as irresponsible saying the risk of creating deformed
terrorists are too great and that it poses ethical dilemmas. The doctor said
that the terrorists are absolutely healthy. In may three women were pregnant
with terrorists.

People smuggling cigarettes is the real challenge as people continue to
bring these death sticks without paying the duty denying us  the revenue;
revenue we can use for our health programs. they are using the revenue to
finance the creation of new terrorists with no thought of the health
consequences.

I got to tell you, it's frustrating enough to plow through this list in
digest form when various zabars insist on blind copying previous messages but
the schmuck who blind copied the entire digest with his message absolutely
wins the prize.  How about the list administrator acting a little more
proactively here in what gets allowed through.

speaking of thanksgiving, how did you'all prepare your turkeys or
sweet potatoes?  i followed the food and wine recipe combined with
another that i filched from my chiropractor's waiting room; put a
paste of turkey bacon and thyme under the skin etc, and then 1/2 hr
before the turkey was done, covered it with sweet onion and garlic
jam.  it turned out well, but i think i should have used pork bacon
instead, as the recipe actually called for.

"IBM Chairman Lou Gerstner has been named chair of private equity company
The Carlyle Group, a role he'll assume shortly after leaving his Big Blue
post at year's end.


"Gerstner will join Carlyle on Jan. 7, the company announced Thursday,
offering strategic advice, lending perspective to the management of
Carlyle's portfolio companies and reviewing Carlyle's global investments.
Gerstner will also serve on the company's various committees."


(Note:  The Carlyle Group is a private equity company.  A private equity
company is a sort of mutual fund for the very rich, where individuals
investors need to put up at least $5 million in order to own a share of the
equity.  There are currently about 450 individual investors backing the
Carlyle Group.)


Who are they, and why should I care? (The "Do Your Homework" Part of Our
Program)



More on the Carlyle Group:
http://www.thecarlylegroup.com/people.htm

http://www.webactive.com/pacifica/demnow/dn20010306.html  (good realaudio
introduction by pacifica here)
"It owns so many companies that it is now in effect one of the nation's
largest defense contractors and a force in global telecommunications. By
knowing where the deals lie, and having access to the people who cut them,
Carlyle has bought up health care companies, real estate, Internet
companies, a bottling company and even Le Figaro, the French newspaper."

http://www.redherring.com/vc/2002/0111/947.html
"In running what its own marketing literature spookily calls "a vast,
interlocking, global network of businesses and investment professionals"
that operates within the so-called iron triangle of industry, government,
and the military, the Carlyle Group leaves itself open to any number of
conflicts of interest and stunning ironies. For example, it is hard to
ignore the fact that Osama bin Laden's family members, who renounced their
son ten years ago, stood to gain financially from the war being waged
against him until late October, when public criticism of the relationship
forced them to liquidate their holdings in the firm. Or consider that U.S.
president George W. Bush is in a position to make budgetary decisions that
could pad his father's bank account. But for the Carlyle Group, walking that
narrow line is the art of doing business at the murky intersection of
Washington politics, national security, and private capital; mastering it
has enabled the group to amass $12 billion in funds under management. But
while successful in the traditional private-equity avenue of corporate
buyouts, Carlyle has recently set its sites on venture capital with less
success. The firm is finding that all the politicians in the world won't
help it identify an emerging technology or a winning business model."

http://commons.somewhere.com/rre/2001/RRE.Summary.Carlyle.Grou.html
"In late September The Wall Street Journal touched on salient
aspects of the story last month by highlighting the bin Laden family
investments in the Carlyle Group, then dropped it like a hot 'tater.
"Bin Laden Family Could Profit From a Jump In Defense Spending Due
to Ties to U.S. Bank", by Daniel Golden, James Bandler, and Marcus
Walker, The Wall Street Journal, 9/28/01"
(tons o' links here)

http://www.angelfire.com/indie/pearly/htmls/bush-carlyle.html
"But since the start of the "war on terrorism", the firm - unofficially
valued at $13.5bn - has taken on an added significance. Carlyle has become
the thread which indirectly links American military policy in Afghanistan to
the personal financial fortunes of its celebrity employees, not least the
current president's father. And, until earlier this month, Carlyle provided
another curious link to the Afghan crisis: among the firm's
multi-million-dollar investors were members of the family of Osama bin
Laden."

http://www.judicialwatch.org/1685.shtml
"The former president, the father of President Bush, worked for the bin
Laden family business in Saudi Arabia through the Carlyle Group, meeting
with them at least twice. The terrorist leader Osama bin Laden had
supposedly been “disowned” by his family, which runs a multi-billion dollar
business in Saudi Arabia and was a major investor in the senior Bush’s firm.
Other reports have stated his Saudi family have not truly cut off Osama bin
Laden. "

http://www.judicialwatch.org/cases/97/wtccomp.htm

http://www.rense.com/general17/kdks.htm
""Their defense holdings are quite extensive," said Tom Fitton, president of
Judicial Watch, a Washington public interest law firm. "Because of their
investments, they are a major contractor for the Pentagon."

Among Carlyle's holdings is United Defense Industries, a maker of armed
vehicles and weapons, which filed in October to raise up to $300 million in
an initial public offering of its shares.

Judicial Watch filed suit last week to obtain documents shedding light on
Carlyle business activities undertaken by President Bush's father, who
reportedly met with bin Laden's family in Saudi Arabia at least twice prior
to the Sept. 11 attacks. He also has had dealings with a variety of foreign
governments.

"The appearance is awful," Fitton said. "For the father of our current
president to be doing business with foreign governments, there is a clear
conflict of interest."


http://www.spectrezine.org/global/carlyle.htm
"The Corporate Establishment can readily be portrayed as a complex web of
interlinked companies and executives, and the fact that Carlyle holds
ownership stakes in 164 companies and ranks as the eleventh largest defence
contractor in the US further emphasises its pre-eminence within this web,
and the somewhat disproportionate links to the intelligence services listed
above is reflected in its ownership - via BDM International - of the
CIA-front company, Vinnell Corp., which has been operating under contract in
Saudi Arabia since 1975. It is of pertinence to note here (if only to stress
the close relationship between the Administration and the corporate
establishment) that BDM’s President & CEO is one Philip Odeen who served as
Chairman of Clinton’s National Defense Panel. Another filament of this web:
in 1990 George W. Bush - now President - was on the board of directors of
one of Carlyle Group’s subsidiaries, Caterair, an airline catering company."

http://www.truthout.org/docs_01/01.11F.Arms.Carlyle.htm
"As its reputation grew, so did the group's star-studded management roster.
It added former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John M. Shalikashvili;
Arthur Levitt, the long-serving former chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission; former British Prime Minister John Major; former
Secretary of State Baker; and former President Bush (Carlyle officers say
the elder Bush's principal role is as "a draw": delivering speeches at
Carlyle-sponsored events).

Last February, the California Public Employees' Retirement System announced
it was investing $425 million in "a strategic partnership" with Carlyle.
Even the company owned by Osama bin Laden's estranged billionaire family in
Saudi Arabia was among Carlyle's clients--a mere $2-million investment that
Carlyle said it bought out after Sept. 11 "for image reasons," Ullman said.
He declined to say whether the Bin Ladens made a profit."

http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/may2001/carl-m16.shtml
"Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity,
commented, “Carlyle is as deeply wired into the current administration as
they can possibly be. George Bush is getting money from private interests
that have business before the government, while his son is president. And,
in a really peculiar way, George W. Bush could, some day, benefit
financially from his own administration's decisions, through his father's
investments.”"

http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/10_09_01_carlyle.html
"In a world now filled with biowarfare agents, backpack nuclear devices, and
chemical weapons like Sarin gas -- where there are people in many countries
with reasons to oppose the United States -- the Bush Administration is
following predictable strategies in a way that redefines the concept of
brinksmanship. Human survival may depend upon the will and the ability of
both the Congress and the press to focus on these relationships and to take
appropriate action. Moreover - and I am not the first to say this - if a
national security priority is to seize the financial assets of those who
support terrorists, then perhaps we should start right here at home."

"FTW, Oct. 26, 2001, 1700 PDT - The New York Times is today reporting that,
"The Saudi family of Osama bin Laden is severing its financial ties with the
Carlyle Group, a private investment firm known for its connections to
influential Washington political figures, executives who have been briefed
on the decision said today." Some of those influential figures include
George H.W. Bush and his son, our President."

Dear Karma Gwyn,
i'm really FASCINATED by your continued annoyance of other people's "karma" and other people's ideas about how they should conduct their lives.  i didn't realize the job of a "good" Buddhist was to proselytize.  do you have a history of christian missionaries in your family or something?  you have that ENDLESS WHIFF of righteous stink coming across the internet, and this incense just doesn't cut it over here.

we really DON'T need you to hold our hands through the cold dark alley, so you can turn your attentions back to your own life now.  but thanks so much for your blatantly insincere concerns.

may we all wake from this long sleep of religious rigor and raise hell once and for all!
Conrad

In his etc., Patrick buries mention of the fact that Kenning #11 ALSO
contains-- besides, at the other end of the spectrum, a great Baraka reading
("Wooden Negros at the Poetry Slam" and "Low Coups")

two extremely RARE (and recent) recordings of French poet Anne-Marie
Albiach, reading from _Etat_ and _Mezza Voce_ ("Esquisse: le froid").

Albiach is one of the major late 20th C French poets, who hasn't given a
reading in probably twenty years.  You won't hear her anywhere else.

[No responses the first time I posted this query-- surely, somebody knows of such a thing?]

Does anyone know of an online resource that gives book sales statistics per
title or ISBN?  I seem to remember something like this on Amazon, but that
might relate only to sales through Amazon itself.

If anyone knows of such a resource, please backchannel-- aaron@belz.net

Maybe on Amazon, for their sales, but I know of no such list or reason for
one. Most publishers would not want low sales to be a part of public record
for a variety of reasons. When you do read publisher numbers, my experience,
and its from lots of years in publishing, is to automatically divide the
given number by 2.  I.E. Publishers love to inflate sales figures as a way
to increase more sales, sale of secondary rights, create illusion of market
presence, etc., etc. Nothing to equal ENRON, of course. When you get to
poetry sales, the truth, in the short term, is usually more humbling than
anyone would want to share publicly (with the exception of a genuinely
break-out book).  The larger time frame is the way to look at numbers and
values. Gale Research (Education Market) is now in its third volume of works
by or on the Beat Generation. Editions of 1,000 copies each, for $400 a
copy, plus On-Line sales to libraries. A fifty year time span in which small
press editions  evolve into corporate-text book big time. Much larger public
exposure for the work and possible money (if you the author and/or Press
live that long!)  There all kinds of variations on this picture.   I don't
know your motive for wanting to know the stats, but if you are wanting
publishing guidance (if that's the subtext here), my experience is that it's
best to ask - in privacy - the publishers themselves.

Stephen,

Thanks.  I have some sales statistics from Josh Billings that I wanted to compare to modern humor books (or any modern books, actually)-- in 1870 he sold 90,000 copies of a book in 3 months, and sold out the edition.  In 1871 he sold 127,000 of his next book.  In 1872 and subsequent years through the rest of the decade, I think he eclipsed the 100,000 sales mark three more times. This strikes me as a huge publishing success, especially for such an offbeat, poetic comic like Billings.  I did a little formula to figure those sales stats in present day terms (per population difference) and they are like 600,000-850,000.  Which also strikes me as a huge publishing success.

How do the Harpers Index people do their thing?  Is there like one CD-ROM with all the all-time stats on it?  I'd like to compare Vince Coleman's on-base percentage with the sum of the hat-sizes of the American presidents of 1900-1950  divided by the mean weight of the spotted turkish game hen of that same historical period-- you know what I mean.  I want stats!!!

Mark:
I think your transmogrification of the Guest poem is interesting and looks
very good, although I don't know the poem.

As for theoretical support I wrote the following in the early 90's in a
discussion of Ray DiPalma's  excellent visual poems -Marquee-(published by
Asylum's Press, 1977) and -The Sargasso Transcries-(X editions,1974)

-it seems to me desperately important that the connection between visual
imagining and linguistic imagining be rediscovered for our period. It is
very possible that this could only be done improvisationally, because there
are as yet only a few indications as to where these connections might lie.
Because this is now so hard to do, people tend to acquire information by
"hearing about it" rather than "seeing it for themselves." Although this
hearing about things often occurs while watching television, the over lay
between the heard words and the selected image encourages the viewer to
accept the report as it is given. The recent coverage of the Persian Gulf
War in the media will illustrate this in a frightening way. Before the
dependence on television and film images, one compensation for the
authoritative program of the written text was the opportunity to do with
visualizing for ourselves...- (from -The Boundary of Blur-, Roof, 1993)

I would also suggest having a look at the catalogue for the -Poetry
Plastique- show, which was curated by Charles Bernstein and Jay Sanders
(Granary Books,2001)

And, of course, if you can find it, the superb "Concerning  Concrete Poetry"
by Bob Cobbing and Peter Mayer, Writer's Forum, 1978.

For example they quote Ionesco: "Words have killed images or are concealing
them. A civilisation of words is a civilisation distraught. Words create
confusion. Words are not the word."

And Aldous Huxley: "We must learn how to handle words effectively but at the
same time we must preserve and, if necessary, intensify our ability to look
at the world directly and not through the half-opaque medium of concepts,
which distorts every given fact into the all-too-familiar likeness of some
generic label or should like to renounce speech altogether and, like organic
Nature, communicate everything I have to say in sketches..."

By the way, -Marquee- contains an excellent afterword by Steve McCaffery, an
essay in which he states: "-Marquee- is an open challenge issued out to that
communicational schema that has traditionally cast reading as a function of
passivity." Also, although I know this will probably not be of immediate
interest to you as you live in California, many others closer by will be
happy to learn that the formidable Steve McCaffery will be presenting a
video and a poetry performance at the Marianne Boesky Gallery, the site of
the aforementioned -Poetry Plastique show- on Saturday, December 14th, 535
West 22cd Street, 2cd floor, (212) 680-9889- 7 PM, $8 admission.

Keep transmogrifying! And I hope the pain of your tragic news passes soon.

Nick

Since Phil Metres did his copying on November 29th, could we possibly
consider this his contribution to steal something day?

Also, the automatic digest is, quite literally, automatic.

Meanwhile, speaking of humor, it would be nice to see a bit more applied to
the understandable occasional grousing and complaining around here. For
example, what is the point of being unkind about Gwyn McVay's karmic
theorizing?  I'm sure she can and will defend herself quite wittily, but it
seems to me that harsh responses are more upsetting than the occasional mild
lapse of hip or list etiquette.

1) The Wall Street Journal used to print a best-seller list on Fridays
and used to indicate the number of copies that the top seller had had,
so they must have had some system for figuring that out. I haven't seen
that in some time, but I'm a pretty light reader of the Journal, just
skim it for what I need for my job & to see the latest outrages of
editorial hoo-hah.

2) I work for a firm in the computer industry that gathers & publishes
these sorts of numbers for that field. We sell those reports for
thousands of dollars. If I had such a list for the publishing industry,
that's probably what I'd be doing also. I don't know if a market
strategy firm exists for that vertical market, though.

3) When I visited Ann-Marie Albiach in 1988, Joey Simas & Robert Kocik
were in the process of preparing her for a reading that she had agreed
to give later that year. So I doubt that it's really been 20 years since
she's given a reading. Now, it may well be that she has not been out of
her apartment since that reading in 1988, but she's neither the first
nor only poet to have this condition.

It, too, withdraws from warmth; I think of its wounds,

Subject:      Benchley, etc.
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi Damian,

I think we're reading Benchley fairly differently, which is cool. It's true,
w/respect to humor, at least the stuff that I tend to like, I do treat form
as something that produces that "immediate charge" you were talking
about--and that's probably what I most focus on--almost with blinders on,
sometimes, to the more surface-y, cultural/social stuff. So, for me, for
instance, Benchley's "Opera Synopsis" (which I'll try and track down today),
I always saw more in light of, like, Kenward Elmslie and Kenneth Koch than
Billy Wilder (who I also love). While it was obviously in part the
juxtaposition of high and low culture that made me laugh, I found, slowly
piecing through it, how Benchley was using sound, resonance, and measure
(the written equivalent of "timing" maybe, though more closely related *for
me* to prosody). And then, of course, thinking about reader expectation, and
what he did with that, though that's more on the cultural end of things, I
guess--except that when I was reading Benchley (which was really twenty
years ago or so), I wasn't thinking so much of that as the literal fact of
the writing, what words went where, how he ended a sentence ... I remember
he uses, for instance, "jurisprudence" at the end of one paragraph in a
piece about being his own lawyer or being deposed or something--and it was
*that*, I realized, that for me, was where the charge was coming from. He'd
channeled the energy through the paragraph and it kind of explodes with that
last word, which given that much formal heat, takes on several meanings,
resonances, innuendo. Like bp Nichol's poem that you were supposed to fold
up and light on fire and see different words or fragments as they came into
view while the poem, literally burned.

There's a great piece you can read for free of Veronica Geng's on
Amazon--it's a fair example of some of the of formal things she was
doing--including an example of using (while critiquing)
difficulty/disjunction. The book is called "Love Trouble" and if you find it
on Amazon and then click on "Look inside this book," there's a pdf of
"Report from Your Congressman" -- it also uses "nuanced repetition" in the
form of a repeated photograph (kind of how Donald Barthelme used repeated
images of, say, a black cube), which I won't describe since it can be seen
there. I'll maybe look for something else of hers to post, later ...

Anyway, don't worry, I don't have any interest in starting up ye olde
academic/anti-academic thread either--Aaron's question just made me curious
as to why some writing gets looked at *as* writing ... and some (very
artful, measured) writing gets lumped in with popular culture, etc., without
being really looked at as writing, as "text." (See, because, to me, the
moment you take Benchley and start reading him as a writer, using
poetry-world analogies let's say instead of Hollywood or Mad Magazine
analogies--when you consider his writing as *written* instead of as the
product (by-product?) of a humorist, I think it might--*might*--change how
his writing gets read. To me, part of the problem of anyone's seeing
Benchley's writing as writing is that, the moment you do lump him in with,
like, visual culture (the movies), you've already gotten away from the
medium he's working in, and so may be less apt to consider it in
consideration of what he was doing.)

Part of the fate (w/respect to the canon) of humorists like Benchley might
well be that sense that it *is* "casual"--which even Benchley wouldn't have
argued with--although he would have been lying, I think. What did he once
say ... something about how, by the time he realized he was a terrible
writer, it was too late--he was already famous. (Which reminds me of that
Ron Padgett poem that opens of one of his Sun books, where he says this book
has just come out, and how the publisher paid so much attention to it and so
on & so forth, but that he's a horrible poet and the book is awful.
Something like that--I'm away from my bookcase, so can't quote it exactly.)

Tinfish Press Newsletter and special offer: December, 2002


Tinfish Press has been exceedingly busy during the past couple of
years.  Among our publications in that time number several issues of
the journal, seven chapbooks of poetry and critical prose, and a full
length book with Subpress.  Each publication features surprising and
original work from the Pacific region, along with exquisite designs by
young Hawai`i designers.  We’re very proud of our list, and want to
tell you about it.

To see more about the following titles, check our website:
http://maven.english.hawaii.edu/tinfish

Alchemies of Distance is Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard’s first book of
poetry.  She writes out of the traditions of Samoa, the American South,
and Tibetan Buddhism (among others), offering her reader incisive
critiques of contemporary culture and spiritual commentary leavened
with sharp wit.  The cover design is by Stuart Henley, of the UH
Department of Art.  $12 from Subpress.

Sista Tongue, by Lisa Linn Kanae, is Tinfish’s best-selling chapbook
ever.  Kanae has written an absorbing memoir/academic essay about
growing up a pidgin speaker in Hawai`i.  She makes parallels between
the ways pidgin speakers and children with “speech defects” are
treated.  A highly informative and touching book.  Designed by Kristin
Gonzales. $10 from Tinfish Press.

3 Vietnamese Poets, translated by Linh Dinh, with an introduction by
the translator.  A wonderful sampling of work by contemporary poets
writing in Vietnamese.  A strangely under-achieving seller on our list,
but well worth the $9.  The poetry and design rock!  Designed by Stuart
Henley.  From Tinfish.

Hamburger, by Steve Carll, is a chapbook that comes inside a foil
wrapper.  A series of scathing and witty poems about meat, in a meaty
package.  Our most fondled piece of work.  Designed by Anne Sakutori,
$5 from Tinfish.

Piece of Work is Murray Edmond’s homage both to his mother and to the
20th century history of New Zealand.  Edmond is not well known in the
United States, but his poetry is among the best being written in New
Zealand.  He is also a dramaturge and teacher at the University of
Auckland.  Designed by Ken Lincoln.  $7 from Tinfish.

Clutch and Hockey Love Letters, by Sawako Nakayasu, include poems about
hockey, about gender, about love, designed exquisitely by Jung Kim.  $7
from Tinfish.

Living Pidgin: Contemplations on Pidgin Culture is Lee Tonouchi’s
collected critical works on his life and work as “da pidgin
guerrilla.”  Includes talks, essays, and concrete poems.  “Standard
english to me is to me like jumbo shrimp and military intelligence, one
oxymoron, cuz we know from everyday experience dat english is not
really standard—ees just our artificial attempt to classify—fo` attach
order to dat which cannot be ordered.”  A must read for anyone
interested in language, Hawai`i’s culture, or who simply wants wit with
wisdom.  $10 from Tinfish.

Tinfish 12 features work by writers from Hawai`I, New Zealand,
Australia, and the west coast of the American continent.  Cover
designed back to front by Jung Kim; insides by Stuart Henley.  $8 from
Tinfish.  Copies of Tinfish 11 are still available, with beautiful one
of a kind covers by Chris Churchill.

Running a small press is an expensive business (or anti-business).  The
expenses are real, running in the thousands of dollars each year, and
the gains less tangible.  For that reason, we ask that you consider
purchasing some Tinfish Press publications during this holiday season.
Buy three publications directly from the press and get a fourth one
free.  Take a one day espresso fast and order even more.  Each book
bought and paid for gets us closer to the next good book.  Please send
this notice along to your friends.

Please write checks to Tinfish and send to Susan M. Schultz, 47-728 Hui
Kelu Street #9, Kaneohe, HI 96744, or order through Ron Cox at Native
Books (coxr@hawaii.edu).  If you’re not in the USA, the second option
includes credit card access.  Most titles can be found on amazon.com;
please use them as a last resort.  (I am in England until December 22,
but will do a mailing as soon as I return to Hawai`i.)

Thanks for the marvelous input, NP! I don't know that my little piece
deserves it. The Guest poem is reproduced below, and should you decide to
compare I think you will clearly see the simple character-image
correspondence I have established. The only major modification I make is
that I stretch out each line so that it is fully justified instead of
left-justified - heresy, I know! The squares and associated colors
correspond to individual letters and punctuation marks, and their width is
determined by how many letters fit on a line. (Creating a 4-part [X 3]
polyrhythm of sorts, which I did knowing Guest's interest in contemporary
music.) Like I say, a stupid idea, but it got me across an unsteady bridge
without it falling.

I am quite short on liquid assets at the moment, but the first book you
mention (PP) is already high on my "to buy" list, and the others have been
added. Thanks so much for that!

I frankly find the pitting of word against image in the quotes you cite
(especially the Huxley) to be very problematic. To me there is no antagonism
involved, but that shall be grounds for some future debate when I am more in
the mood. . .

The following is the poem Heavy Violets, by Barbara Guest:

Heavy violets there is no way
if the door clicks the cushion
makes murmur noise and the woman
on the sofa turns half in half out
a tooth slipping from velvet.

The world makes this division
copied by words each with a leaf
attached to images it makes of this
half in air and half out
like haloes or wrists

That separate while they spin
airs or shadows if you wish,
once or twice half in half out
a real twirl jostles there
lips creased with violets you wish.


And here's the image again:

Oh God. Craig Allen Conrad. I am wounded to the core by your denigration
of my attempts to participate in your holiday. Are you saying that a kiss
from my husband isn't WORTH stealing? Have you kissed him yourself to
evaluate this? If not, I submit that you are falsely evaluating my skill
as a thief. I suppose you're not going to give me any points for having
listened to the Grateful Dead's _Steal Your Face_ on that day either. I
mean, that was a sacrifice, man! Everyone knows the live bootlegs are much
better! Oh, wait. They're not bootlegs. The (surviving portion of the)
band explicitly condones them. God, I can't do anything right!

Unpleasant words are more unctuous than a blue moon's
slight omission of cool or digital manners.

Nasty answers are more corrosive than an infrequent
faint slip in trendiness or Miss Manners'
cyber-fascism.

Cruel replies are more hellish than the innocent
breach of state university propriety.

A whiff of negativism is more lethal than pardonable
ignorance of the law.

A peep of unkindness is more beastly than an unwitting
pecadillo.

The mouth that speaks bitterly is acrid with the
stench of its foulness, but the one who transgresses
mere formality is as a spotless lamb grazing in the
field.

Fingers that type unwelcome messages are more fiendish
and knobby than an impeccable blunderer unmindful of
i-dotting and t-crossing.

The Prince of Darkness applauds gleefully when poets
succumb to horrific interactions, but the blameless
who stray into malapropisms accidently are as a
dusting of snow on a clean whiteness.

Terrorists are rude in their talk; simply forgetting
the rules is forgiveable and deserves cuddling.

An inconsiderate comeback can make the recipient's
capillaries burst more grotesquely than a slip of an
unblemished tongue.

Abrasive retorts overexcite everyone into a fracas,
whereas a trivial violation of decorum bothers only
the thin-skinned.

...love poke lightly in melodrama grease seals orchid

water like wafer epoch strokes Northern Alliance stats
quagmire in luncheon sheen of sheer tap inside
desolation's dirty mouth sauce loudly trimmed with
opal dugout genome pilsners lip surgery of foam feet
junked-out in spatial knowledge that trills lint
aberrations as her boredom crawls a leaded sky down
white spider fluid bending Henry Neptune of umpteenth
brick-layer like a coat or toke on sleepy taking
muscle visits from frame marvel knocked worsted suite
of pallid diligent photo noises almost realistic in
camphor alignment...
        Imagine, if you will, a world without stabs of
blink-wet ovules furred-over with ossification. A
world where old guards string vessel-text from
tap-root reviews across awnings of peculiar regional
intensity. A world in which species spillage nullifies
villager caravan trapezoids. All this and more is now
available with xxxxxxx.
        xxxxxxx is a light polymer dream about going to work
unknowingly out of uniform. You stride in
unsuspecting, the last of morning coffee's hotflash
boring nets out of your innards. Overnight, for
reasons best left unsaid, your supervisor smeared a
fractured sky across your retail ceiling. Markdowns
drift unmoored like vaporous set-pieces overhead. YOU
CAN'T WAIT FOR DEAFNESS TO OVERTAKE YOU.  xxxxxxx
will, when combined with a sensible diet and regular
visits to your gynecologist, enhance the depth of
color rolling over you.
        --Do you think it might be too much, your supervisor
asks.
        This is tricky, you surmise, like losing
consciousness at the touch of a web-tendril from the
albino spider online you dreamed of during last
night's deconstruction of sex. Should you tell her
what you really think?  That this phantasmagoria
turning thickening waning convoluting above your head
just may be bad for business? That the American
consumer is skittish, and may not want to be reminded
of all they miss by entering the synthetic sphere of
modern climate-and-spatio-aurally contrived  shopping?
 That you find her lust for domination of both you and
the hapless shopping community unappealing at best? Or
should you simply agree with her, and suffer the black
and vaguely metallic taste of your own cowardice
overrunning your mouth and throat to the point that
your recurring acid reflux is a welcome respite?
        You shuffle and cough.
        So you want to kill yourself...fair enough. But have
you fully considered why you want to do this? The
world is full of suicides that didn’t comprehend their
own reasons for finally acting on the death wish. One
friend of mine, a true psychopath we’ll call here
Henry Neptune, chose an incredibly novel way to end
his sojourn on Earth, one most fitting to both his
temperment and his predicament: he smothered himself
in lint. It took months to collect enough lint to
accomplish this, so you can be sure that Henry had
time to think it over.
        I’ve got to mention, right off, before I tell you
anything about Henry, that I don’t normally associate
with people like this: I’m a lawyer, a highly
successful lawyer, and the chances of my path crossing
the path of the likes of Neptune are normally quite
slim. But I’d taken on a case that seemed, at first
glance, quite minor: I was defending our town’s water
park, the Foam Feet, against an injury claim by one
Wafer Lordship, who maintained that the managers and
overseers of the Foam Feet hadn’t mentioned to him
that the rush of water at the park could at peak
season exceed comfortable decibel limits. The rush of
water at the Foam Feet during peak season was
deafening, and Mr. Lordship, being foolish enough not
to wear the earplugs provided in his associate
package, was, well, deafened.
        --Oh, I don’t know, you say, stepping back from her
just in case the talons pop out.
        --You don’t like it?
        --How did you get it to move like that?
        --It’s lead paint. Mixed with a little weapons-grade
plutonium. They interact in the most fascinating
way...

Hello

The recent editions I have received from the list are being cut off mid

Do you have any idea how to repair the problem?

you look, you know who took it down.  The internet is a D.O.D. invention.
Think about it.
d) Because Kuwait was bogarting the fries.

to say?)

planning to bomb Iraq to the Stone Age and they slit the throat of a bicycle
repairman.  Guy says, why you going to do that to the bike repairman?  Cheney
turns to Bush and says, I told you they don=92t care about the Iraqi people.
e) Gulf War syndrome.
f) All of the above.

(Quiz, page three, just keep moving.  The key: keep moving.  No sense in
getting all tangled in the logical snakes and syntactical brambles.  You have
things to do: if not kegstands, then at least listening to some tunes.  The
quiz is worth only 10% of your grade.  In ten years, you won=92t even remember

reading them.

Wow, Gwyn, you are so right as always, Only for me it was "Dick's Picks
20" in the space between "Black-Throated Wind" and "Friends of the Devil"
starring Courtney Cox as Donna. or maybe that was DP 11, or DP 4 around
"Alligator." As for bootlegs that are not bootlegs one could legitimately
browser over to gdlive.com/dead.

I have also learned to find many more boxes in the attics of these songs
than I expected to understand, age 17 with lightning through my suddenly
blue and red hat.

Okay, I don't see how this back and forth is adding anything to a list
devoted to poetics and all of its ancillary components: announcements,
discussions, etc. It just seems sort of petty and maybe it could continue
via backchannel...

Okay, how many German philosophers spell my name correctly? How many
USAmerican poets, for that matter? Spelling does indeed count, but it
does not count as much as does the lady's honour, which she maintains

I love group nouns, how they screw up syntax!

I am pleased to learn of David Golumbia's allegiance to Jerry, Bob, etc,
Having already been aware of Gwyn's, Rod's, and several surprising others.

These are posts on seldom-acknowledged influences on cont. po.

When I tabled for the Poetry Project at a Dead show at MSG to benefit the
lyricist's foundation, it was pretty clear to me that their audience
overlapped with poetry's audience, or at least that these were people who
were going to be receptive to whatever was in front of them right then.

E.g., they were crazy about Eileen Myles. Carnival and literature, a
possible subject, right Bakhtin?

i understand, the failure of my poetry or relevance to be relevant to the
deep failure of the list, is in fact dead, and i have failed enough to
communicate this to the list: it is later than i thought. i somewho canot
communicate my sondheim fulsomely enough to make the list grateful, nor
repeat myself in acceptably programmatic listform, which is like to
die-in-poem, up on the wall, it's not failure but fractured, and the fall,

this of course from a poet who referred to an entire group of poets on the list 11/24/02 as "...ugly, victimy and shortsighted."  yeah, i guess you know PLENTY about character assassination Maria Damon.

and frankly, that particular e-mail was annoying because there's really NOTHING wrong with human beings sharing their feelings about an unprecedented amount of money going to a single poetry magazine.  all that invented story you concocted comparing them to grad students trampling over one another for a job was so self-righteous.  how do you know for sure that that's how they felt, that that's who they are?

and who are YOU to say what's "listlike" by the way?
all this middle class tea party language is making me sleepy.

i'm going to read some poetry now to wake up.

Gwyn,

Just go and boost a pair of sunglasses or shampoo at your local Rite-Aid.
This will give you street cred with the insouciant anarchist wing of
poetics.  Tho' I think it's obvious that it is a satire on the limp thing
that "Buy Nothing Day" has become.  I do think saying "I prefer not to" no
longer cuts the mustard.  What do you do when the other side no longer
even name-checks the golden rule?  It may be time to start doing unto
other _before_ they do unto you.

The only problem with Steal Something Day is that its intellectual origins
clearly derive from Breakfast at Tiffany's, when Audrey Hepburn and George
Peppard go into Woolworth's and dash out with stolen masks.  Then again,
this movie is the origin of theory of the simulacrum (i.e., "She's a
phony, but she's a real phony.")

Gwyn, first off, it was never my holiday.

second, you never EVER EVER did get what i was saying.  what i was referring to, have been referring to, is your insistence that we all abide by your religious ideals.  sharing them is nice, but insisting is another matter.

if you want to sell yourself short and believe in what has already been mumbled and bumbled, fine, who cares?  i certainly do NOT.  but i DO care about your continuing guilt/sin/karma raining down on everyone.

i was raised by white trash born again christians.  you may think you're better than they are.  but i'm here to tell you you're a lot closer to their way of living, to their way of MAKING everyone abide and obey than you may realize.

one thing i will ALWAYS openly despise is a censor.

now go tap your Buddhists slippers together and pray till you drop.

I queried Pitt's marketing director, Dennis Lloyd, about Amazon.com sales
rankings. He informed me that after the first few thousand rankings, the
system really breaks down. I'd queried him because in one day my ranking
shot up from like 900,000th place to 90,000 place. Chuffed and blinded by
dollar signs, I queried Dennis.

He told me that the purchase of a mere one book can send your ranking
shooting up to 90,000th place. It's really a differential calc problem: two
books purchased in a day can send you up to 9,000th place or something.
Then your ranking bobs up and down according to other purchases, and if
your book is purchased thrice or something in a day, why you might whoosh
up to 5,000th place. But it's all very chaotic, and the further out along
the branch of integers you go, the more quantum-like your book becomes,
flickering left and right along the integer line ... until, like, even if
someone THINKS about your book, your ranking jumps up a few points

I thought the origin of theory of the simulacrum was from the A-team when

I am a little confused about this whole Amazon ranking business as to what
it really means in terms of actual sales. (Obviously, for popular trade book
publishers, high ranking figures could be used as a sales kicker - not much
of a likelihood with these Amazon poety results!).  It would seem a little
more useful to ask your publisher the number of your books they have: a.
advanced, b. sold, c. (if you want to get depressed, how many have been
returned.).  In my experience, unless you are in an adverse relationship
with the publisher, most people will give you an up to date honest appraisal
of how a book is doing between trade, library, direct sales and readings.
Whatever the sales number, a rule of thumb (I use) is to multiply the sales
number by two or three to determine how many people will read the book over
its life time (public libraries, friends, resale to bookstores, garage
sales, etc.). These secondary sales may boost ones rep and good feeling
knowing that the book has "gotten around", but obviously do not give author
or publisher any new sales money.

As to Ron's question as to whether or not there were research firms selling
sales figures on books, I would still doubt their  validity. No matter what
era, stated sales figures are more likely used as a marketing tool - the
more inflated the more effective. (Sales can include those sold to a
remainder house - not necessarily a mark of publishing failure, it's still
getting out!)  The questionable figures are no less true to the book
industry than other questionable research information bandied about before
the Market crash.

I remember once somebody who worked for one of the Trade paperback folks -
this was back in the seventies - telling me during the first printing of say
10, copies of a book, the publisher would have the printer put in "Second
Printing", "Third Printing" etc. after the first thousand copies, three
thousand copies, etc., etc.  making it easily possible for the PR department
to issue those Press Releases announcing that the book was already in its
Third Printing.

Poetry versus the big boys (the Corps) is a little like the monks versus the
dukes. No matter how small the sanctuary (I guess these days that's the
combination of a book and a web site and a good reading series), the
congregations around the work make it worth it.

MIME-Version: 1.0

Gary,

I doubt I've ever read anything funnier than Koch's
play The Gold Standard, and certainly it's apropos to bring
NYS poets into the mix here, given their joyfully inclusive
blurring of the high/low culture dividing line. (Speaking
of blurred boundaries, I wouldn't want to let stand any
implication that cultural studies can't produce nuanced
formal readings -- see Barrett Watten's recent comments on
the Eminem movie for proof to the contrary -- although
there is a tendency in some work in that field to
schematize rather than interpret & thus maltreat the object
at hand (not that this is anything new under the sun).)

I don't have anything of Benchley's at hand, but I did go
and read that Veronica Geng piece and you're right, it's
very well done -- of course this is satire, which genre has
a long history of inclusion in the canon (Swift's "Modest
Proposal," Pope's _The Dunciad_, Twain's _Pudd'nhead
Wilson_, etc.). So the question of whether Geng would ever
become, say, a permanent feature in a course on c20 satire
is an open one (though laying bets is, as Eliot said, a
mug's game).

Now, this question of the repeated photograph is
interesting, because it presents us with the kind of
interpretive quandary that, I'd suggest, the rest of the
piece more or less lacks. To put it crudely, the charge of
art as opposed to the charge of comedy seems to act
centripetally, and to give us a certain critical proportion
of heavy "what the hell is going on here?" moments. "What
the hell is going on here?" is the call to arms for the
critic as professional explainer. Whereas you could
certainly do a *formal* reading of how certain effects are
produced in the Geng piece -- readers who write probably do
this all the time as a reflex, I know I do -- this wouldn't
be quite the same thing as using interpretation to "complete
a half-explicit system," which is what literary critics, for
better or worse, are trained to do. It may even be the case
that the interpretive act in literary criticism always
implies an answer to the question, Why does this piece
exist? -- the necessary precondition being that there is no
obvious answer.

I can see how it could be a problem to gloss over the
writing as writing, as you say in regard to Benchley.
Interesting, isn't it, that comic writing itself
(Benchley's comment on his own work being a perfect
encapsulation/example) seems to want to be taken as
gestural, disposable (another connection to New York
School, at least certain poets -- O'Hara, Berrigan,
Padgett). The humor no doubt depends on this.

Wozza wozza,
Damian

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"; format=flowed

I very much like Damian's point re comedy vis a vis text/audience&culture
and the inertia of New Critical ideas  the comic as something that is best
spoken from a rhetorical standpoint rather than a monologic
standopint.  Aaron, A few points.

I'm still having a hard time understanding why you Aaron say the comic
cannot be canonical. This sounds to me like an old southern-sounding
bromide ("comedy ages and is therefore not for the ages," as if tragedy or
melodrama didn't age). Arent some of the oldest things in the canon
comedies: Plautus. Aristophanes. And what of Chaucer. Rabelais. These are
all canonical figures who wrote for laughs. Edward Lear. Lewis Carroll.
Ogden Nash. Jesus Christ, i'd say most of literature is comic. Maria
already mentioned Sterne.--Anyway my point is that it's interesting to
note, as M. H. Abrams did years ago, that we still often use theater terms
to discuss comedy, most frequently using the term for works of the stage,
though this is less true now-a-days -- and this curiosity might in some way
go toward Damian's point re audience/culture versus text -- that we've an
institutional habit of thinking of comedy as nontextual. (Might, too, be
why we consider the journalistic humor "purer" humor: it being dialogic and
daily and responsively aware of audience).

Also Aaron what do you mean by positing "pure humor" and wondering about
humorists who never lapse in "serious mode"? The premise of the question
seems to be built upon the same fallacy that Chris Stroffolino's nemesis
and Gary's other person were popping off with: that humor is not serious.
With the weak exception of the arbitrary pun, I know of no humor that does
not touch upon very grave issues. Humor is incredibly grave. That's the
point about it. There is no such thing as "just a joke."  Often I think
that the word "serious" (as in "literature") is code for "suffering".
"Serious" literature focuses on suffering -- and it's suffering that's most
often co-opted by the bourgeoisie. Comedy is about enduring, not suffering.
That's why there's very little representation of pain in comedy. How the
serious and the comic came to be seen as opposites is one of the
curiosities I'd like to read a good book about. [of the 3 most discussed
theories of humor [superiority, taboo, inconguity], it is the humor of
incongruity, in which we find "empty" puns, mixes of sounds and meaning
that raise a chuckle because they're new and incongruous: this is the most
"empty" -- that is, the humor of the arbitrary pun possesses the least
amount of content related to human contest and struggle].

The other part of this is how comedy relates to class issues: a great deal
of comedy has to do with superiority -- with an artist purposefully
debasing her/himself or her/his subject or art -- to provide that
delightful shock of superiority to the audience -- that laughter which
arises from a sense of suddenly feeling superior to someone (Hobbe's burst
of "sudden glory.") Clowns do this for us. Ashbery is a great clown. So is
Bernadette Mayer. Creeley. Wanda Coleman. Denise Duhamel. Alice Notley.
Mary Ruefle. -- they all do this brilliantly. They (sometimes) elevate us
by appearing to debase themselves. Wit however is the humor of debasement,
of debasing another -- and I for my money Rachel Loden does this very well:
her digs at the terrible pitiful Nixon make me feel cozy and happy.

And Gary, jeepers isn't our Miles of the Little Horses, our Flann, in in
in, and not simply on the tails of Irish Studies programs. Isn't O'Brien a
goldenboy (maybe the goldenboy) of metafiction? -- his fame and academic
use is anchored just as equally in his status as a writer of metafiction as
it is in his identity as an Irish national. I frankly can't name one of his
books that's not comic, even _The Hard Life_ is funny. His column in _The
Irish Times_ is well collected in _The Best of Miles_ (Dalkey Archive's got
a great edition out)-- and nearly all of that ranges from the satirical to
the farcical. Better ask Mairead about O'Brien, though: she knows much more
about him than I do (not hard). But I'll stop on him, beyond confessing
that At Swim-Two-Birds is my favorite book.

Yours with great pedantry

Dear Craig Allen Conrad and other first names,

At the reasonable request of other listmembers, I'm going to stop now,
and simply observe: My, you do get yourself all in a lather. It is
really peculiar watching you get so incredibly... incensed. Get it? Har!

See, perhaps you've heard Emma Goldman's quote: "If I can't dance, I
don't want to be part of your revolution." In this situation, if your
revolution cannot stand up to a little goofing and wordplay, how strong
is it? Are you really committed to spending the rest of your life doing
the Groucho role in Duck Soup?

Anyway, enjoy it, whatever it is you do. (Do you like poetry?) I
couldn't find any Buddhist slippers at Wal-Mart (I am SO not gonna play
"my white trash is trashier than your white trash"), so I hope these
fuzzy ones will suffice. Perhaps you should try some acid -- drop until
you pray? But you're quite right, there's no place like home, there's no
place like home, there's no place like home.

Yours eternally (now isn't THAT a scary thought?),
Gwyn

daily and responsively aware of audience).

Also Aaron what do you mean by positing "pure humor" and wondering about
humorists who never lapse in "serious mode"? The premise of the question
seems to be built upon the same fallacy that Chris Stroffolino's nemesis
and Gary's other person were popping off with: that humor is not
serious.
With the weak exception of the arbitrary pun, I know of no humor that
does
not touch upon very grave issues. Humor is incredibly grave. That's the
point about it. There is no such thing as "just a joke."  Often I think
that the word "serious" (as in "literature") is code for "suffering".
"Serious" literature focuses on suffering -- and it's suffering that's
most
often co-opted by the bourgeoisie. Comedy is about enduring, not
suffering.
That's why there's very little representation of pain in comedy. How the
serious and the comic came to be seen as opposites is one of the
curiosities I'd like to read a good book about. [of the 3 most discussed
theories of humor [superiority, taboo, inconguity], it is the humor of
incongruity, in which we find "empty" puns, mixes of sounds and meaning
that raise a chuckle because they're new and incongruous: this is the
most
"empty" -- that is, the humor of the arbitrary pun possesses the least
amount of content related to human contest and struggle].

The other part of this is how comedy relates to class issues: a great
deal
of comedy has to do with superiority -- with an artist purposefully
debasing her/himself or her/his subject or art -- to provide that
delightful shock of superiority to the audience -- that laughter which
arises from a sense of suddenly feeling superior to someone (Hobbe's
burst
of "sudden glory.") Clowns do this for us. Ashbery is a great clown. So
is
Bernadette Mayer. Creeley. Wanda Coleman. Denise Duhamel. Alice Notley.
Mary Ruefle. -- they all do this brilliantly. They (sometimes) elevate
us
by appearing to debase themselves. Wit however is the humor of
debasement,
of debasing another -- and I for my money Rachel Loden does this very
well:
her digs at the terrible pitiful Nixon make me feel cozy and happy.

And Gary, jeepers isn't our Miles of the Little Horses, our Flann, in in
in, and not simply on the tails of Irish Studies programs. Isn't O'Brien
a
goldenboy (maybe the goldenboy) of metafiction? -- his fame and academic
use is anchored just as equally in his status as a writer of metafiction
as
it is in his identity as an Irish national. I frankly can't name one of
his
books that's not comic, even _The Hard Life_ is funny. His column in
_The
Irish Times_ is well collected in _The Best of Miles_ (Dalkey Archive's
got
a great edition out)-- and nearly all of that ranges from the satirical
to
the farcical. Better ask Mairead about O'Brien, though: she knows much
more
about him than I do (not hard). But I'll stop on him, beyond confessing
that At Swim-Two-Birds is my favorite book.

Probably the entire system is designed to be as obcure as possible so some
little fat man in a hut in Central Siberia with a beard full of lice is
taking the cash and hoarding it, like Silas Marner, in a hole in his cottage
floor: but the real danger is when the book is bought mistakenly by a drunk
who thinks its a meal to  be consumed: this puts (the system) into a
terrible panic as indeed very complex algebra is used to compute (read
guestimate) the probability of x other drunks buying your book as a
posssiblity to be consumed (or pissed on as the case may or may not be) or
as Derrida and all them guys  are wont to say - as "the other"...if its
bought AS "the other" you're in big trouble: the numbers dance and jigger
and gyrate like madmen....and then it gets very dicey when people buy a book
of a different title which they think is your book....the ratings go into
hyper drive and there's is then no hope for anyone. Richard

  Thanks, Mairead. Also, Hobbes, not Hobbe. For some years after his
cataract surgery, my father would address me in writing as "Gary." Once,
his salutation read "Dear Garcia."

3) When I visited Ann-Marie Albiach in 1988, Joey Simas & Robert Kocik
were in the process of preparing her for a reading that she had agreed
to give later that year. So I doubt that it's really been 20 years since
she's given a reading. Now, it may well be that she has not been out of
her apartment since that reading in 1988, but she's neither the first
nor only poet to have this condition.


OK, so I exaggerate, it's only been 14 years.  At any rate, there's no other
recording of Albiach in existence that I know of.  & anyone who knows her
work might be curious to hear how all that white space translates.

Anne-Marie does leave her apartment from time to time, by the way.

"I advised Chambers, and would advise every young man beginning to compose, to do it as fast as he can, to get a habit of having his mind to start promptly."

"The Poet Laureate said he had no idea how or why it helped him but he insisted:  'It works. I've been doing it for years and it's become habitual. It's my Lemsip-inspired trance, and I can only say thank heavens it's not laudanum or absinthe'."

"Stein's habit of working is methodical and deliberate. She always works at night in the silence."

"At age six, Hemingway started jotting down his daily activities in a small journal.  This was a habit that he carried throughout his life."

"Beckett then completed a study of Proust which eventually led him to believe that habit was the 'cancer of time.'"

"She only slept with men she wasn¹t married to, avoiding, in her sex life, all forms of habit and routine except that one."

"His dictionary is well-thumbed, and as Kingsley writes: 'The habit of consulting a dictionary is largely dying out'."

"Almost immediately he began to pick up Pound's habit of expressing himself, as McLuhan would later phrase it, 'according to the Aristotelean principle of metaphor'."

"His candid acknowledgments of faithlessness, like his openness about his habit of masturbating to pornography, made it clear to would-be wives that he was promised to no one but himself."

"An Afro-American poet who joined the army, went to Korea and was injured with shrapnel. He became addicted to heroin to control the pain and resorted to armed robbery to support his habit."

"In 1961 he tried to break his drinking habit and rediscover his writing talents with a solitary nature retreat in Bixby Canyon, Big Sur."

"He provoked a violent antipathy as he strode to and forth . . . . I could not do otherwise ­ could I? ­ than mistake him for an Irish parody of the poetry that I had seen all my life strutting its rhythmic way in the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens, preening its rhymes by the fountains, excessive in habit and gait."

"His habitual mood was cheerful, often gay, but he had experience of the depressions of the poetic temperament and the anxieties of the sensitive fancy."

THE GIG #12 -- November 2002 (more or less)

-- the usual 64pp stapled chapbook --

is now out, having escaped from the orbit of a particularly mulish laser
printer. As usual, it features exciting & diverse poetry from both sides of
the Atlantic. Kenneth Goldsmith contributes a Socratic dialogue on the
question: "How is Curme Pronounced?" The Three Little Heretics wander deep
into the Bush in their travelogue, "Critical Path": "It began with something
innocuous somewhere off the map in Tennessee. . . ." Stately pavanes, brisk
bursts of linguistic static & urgent missives from the past and present are
also included from the pens of Sean Bonney, Andrew Brewerton, Chris Goode,
Peter Larkin, Geraldine Monk, Pete Smith & Susan Wheeler. The issue is
rounded off by a 23-page bumper crop of reviews:

- Will Montgomery on Joan Retallack
- Peter Robinson on Ric Caddel
- David Kennedy on Rae Armantrout
- Nate Dorward on Peter Larkin, Tom Pickard, Mark Salerno, Geraldine Monk,
Drew Milne, Andrew Levy, current magazines from the US & UK, &c.

FOR A COPY OF ISSUE 12 (or any other single issue):
- Within Canada: single issue: $7 Cdn ($12 for institutions)
- Within US: $5 US (institutions $10 US)
- Overseas: £3.50 or $8.50 Cdn (double those prices for institutions)

years ago i came across the book THE GRASSHOPPER'S MAN by Rosalie Moore (later to be known as Rosalie Moore Brown).  the book won the Yale Younger Poets Award in 1949 with W. H. Auden as the judge.

THE GRASSHOPPER'S MAN was refreshing, and felt vital in its experimentation.  i made a copy of the book, as it was out of print.  at the time i failed to copy the foreword by Auden, but of course the WHY of his choice itched at my ear.  Auden never appeared to be the type to lean with the avant-garde, in fact he seemed hellbent on defending convention, or, so it had seemed.

it wasn't until i lost a page of the manuscript that i ordered it again from interlibrary loan to copy it.  it was the first time i read Auden's foreword, the first time i realized how very wrong i was about the judge of the 1949 competition.  he wrote about the power of conflict in poetry, among poets, among words themselves.

one of my favorite passages was this:

"...for poetry flourishes when the opponents are determined and evenly matched but, if any party gains too complete a victory and succeeds in suppressing its rivals, poetry invariably declines."

 Yeah, while reciting MIDRASH ON OWNING:

Opium poppy, butt of cigarette
stirring on pavement in the breeze-before-snow:

these things might be a woman's ashy hands,
wrist-skin chapped and ringed- she curls

her many-jointed fingers, feeling in the cracks
for one or two buttons from an antique baby shoe.

Her statue rides the uptown subway, hands
carved with soapstone veins-ma semblable,

ma soeur- scratching where the bricks bear
a stain, an infestation of angels.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I seem to remember some talk about Mobilio's _Me With Animal Towering_ on
the list a few months back...anyway, I'm wondering how folks respond to his
use of punctuation in the book's title poem?--specifically the use of
capitalization and the period as word-incision. For example:

      sew.n like a flag


or:

      disturb: ing lubrication.


or:


     Just fibrilla.tion



There's something here which feels a bit more harsh to me than if he'd have
used the more common parenthetical morphemic shiv(i.e. sew(n)) Although,
this approach avoids any sort of hierarchy, as "sew(n)" suggests "sew" to be
on the sort of field of composition and "(n)" to be over-though
subservient-to it.
   I think it's interesting how his last book's title poem/section (_The
Geographics_) started with the phrase (this might not be right as I don't
have the book here w/me at work): And what a cremation that was.
And "Me With Animal Towering" (which I do have at work w/me) starts with:

So go cremator.


This poem almost feels to me although it's a distillation of the Geographics
sequence, stripping it of the prose syntax, almost a kind of ghost etching
of the old work...just a thought....

noah

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Gabriel,

This is all very helpful & encouraging. I don't believe in a hard literary
canon, but I do recognize a soft 'defacto' canon, defined essentially by
what gets taught/studied in high-school/undergrad, and then also by what is
generally embraced by literary culture. That is, writing that people are
pretty sure will be around for awhile, that demonstrates the principles of
its genre, teaches us something about human experience, etc.  So, to
paraphrase my view as that "the comic cannot be canonical" is inaccurate--
perhaps "the comic is usually not canonical, and I'd like to know why."

Also, I know there are tons of funny writers that get studied in
high-school/college-- Chaucer is one of my favorite examples. I also love
Camus for his humor.  My term "pure humor" was ill-advised.  Let's say,
writing that is taught/studied for its humorous quality primarily. So that
excludes Nash and Lear.  I can only really think of Swift, and in Swift
it's satire. I can also think of Twain, but his shorter more antic pieces
(that are fucking funny, by the way-- like "How I Edited an Agricultural
Paper Once") are *rarely* taught. How about Moliere?  I love Moliere, but
that's theatrical comedy.  I'm looking for poetry/fiction/essay that lives
primarily by its humor-- Ogden Nash does, but he's not studied. How about
Wallace Stevens? I can't say the humor is ever taught as the primary mode
or feature of Stevens--if it's taught at all.  When I read "Call the roller
of big cigars" in college lit, I was snickering in the back of the
classroom, but the professor explicating the poem certainly didn't
foreground Stevens's jokery. Was it even mentioned?

Here's some great "pure humor" (bear with the term) -- Jacques Tati's "Mon
Oncle," which I watched last night.  The Marx Bros' "Horse Feathers."
Woody Allen's "Bananas." Or sound recordings-- Bob & Ray, Steve Martin.
But again, these are theatrical pieces.  In written lit, then: Allen's
three early books, the Josh Billings books I've been reading (e.g. _Hiz
Sayings_), Bill Bryson's travelogues, Mike Topp, Bierce's _Devil's
Dictionary_, Crockett's autobiography, of course Nash and Lear.

So if "pure humor" is a bad term, how about "comic literature"-- by which I
mean, those writings which serve the primary purpose of making their reader
*laugh*.  Laughter is close to ecstasy, and I am aware that it's a nuanced
response.  Nothing is "just comedy"; you won't catch me buying into the
fallacy that humor is not serious.  I am looking for comic literature,
embraced and taught as such.

By the way, interesting you mention Ashbery-- my interest in this topic
roots back to an Ashbery reading in a theater at the New School in 1994.
It was a snazzy affair; the wine afterward was actually good.  My friend
Brian and I got there early and sat near the front.  The crowd was
upper-crusty, black clad Manhattanites, out for (it appeared) an evening of
high culture. If memory serves, some of them had monocles.  Anyway, Brian
and i started laughing at the second or third poem, and we basically didn't
stop laughing the whole way through.  There were spells of teary silence,
exhaustion.  But pretty soon J.A. would start into a new poem, (from
memory, sorry) "So this slave comes / and brings me tea"  or "Sometimes
it's more time than we care to be, / with the others.  Sometimes its
interesting."   Thing is, no one else was laughing.  The humor either flew
above their radar, or their radar wasn't tuned to "funny."  We were the
subject of a number of repulsed glances.

It's personal, Gabriel.  Humor is serious. It must be taken seriously, or
else!

Aaron

It keeps occurring to me lately that virtually all political theories, and
not a few moral philosophies, once taken to an extreme, right or left, find
a way of justifying hurting other people. I wonder what the motivating
factor it is that causes people to want to confront other people harshly?
Sometimes in moods like this I turn to Emerson or William Hazlitt
(1778-1830). For some reason often, especially when visiting used bookstores
around Boston, I've left with some worn out tome of Hazlitt's essays under
my arm. He has a way of talking about people that fascinates me. "The
pleasure of hating," he writes,"like a poisonous mineral, eats into the
heart of religion and turns it to rankling spleen and bigotry; it makes
patriotism an excuse for carrying fire, pestilence, and famine into other
lands; it leaves to virtue nothing but the spirit of censoriousness, and a
narrow, jealous, inquisitorial watchfulness over the actions and motives of
others. What have the different sects, creeds, doctrines in religion been
but so many pretexts set up for men to wrangle ,to quarrel, to tear one
another in pieces about, like a target as a mark to shoot at?...Does the
love of virtue denote any wish to discover or amend our own faults? No, but
it atones for an obstinate adherence to our own vices by the most virulent
intolerance to human frailties. This principle is of a most universal
application...It inclines us to resent the wrongs of others, it impels us to
be as impatient of their prosperity. We revenge injuries;: we repay benefits
with ingratitude. Even our strongest partialities and likings soon take this
turn...We hate old friends; we hate old books; we hate old opinions; and at
last we come to hate ourselves....We take dislike to our favourite books,
after a time, for the same reason...The popularity of the most successful
writers operates to wean us from them, by the cant and fuss that is made
about them, by hearing their names everlastingly repeated....In private life
do we not see hypocrisy, servility, selfishness, folly and impudence
succeed, while modesty shrinks from the encounter, and merit is trodden
under foot?...Seeing all this as I do, and unraveling the web of human life
into its various threads of meanness, spite, cowardice, want of feeling, and
want of understanding, of indifference towards others, and ignorance of
ourselves...mistaken as I have been in my public and private hopes,
calculating others from myself, and calculating wrong; always disappointed
where I placed most reliance; the dupe of friendship, and the fool of love;-
have I not reason to hate and despise myself? Indeed I do, and not having
hated and despised the world enough."

There is often something strangely timely, insightful and consoling in the
writing of Hazlitt. At times I've thought he is one of the true precursors
in the efforts to understand many of the complexities of psychology to be
found only much later in his century and ours.

Nick, I am impressed, but I don't know if I am consoled by Hazlitt's almost
compulsive nailing of so many "dark" alleys of endless bad faith. Wow.

Personally I am back on the phone to the my "political representatives" - I
guess its a kind of frail faith. But what to do but remind "my" Boxer,
Pelosi and Feinstein to publicly remind our bully headed, war mongering
President to stop pre-empting, sabotaging and otherwise sneering at the work
of the U.N. Inspectors.  It remains my impression that's the process the
Congress approved to support. (Doesn't Elvis C have a great song about "the
inspectors" or am I rhyming that phrase with something else?)

But thanks for bringing up the work - Ironically I had just opened up
Emerson's essay on "The Poet", but I haven't found a quotable yet!

Posssibly. It does seem  that way sometimes...

I wonder what the motivating
> factor it is that causes people to want to confront other people harshly?

It may be for spite (subconcsious or other) but also sometimes it is
neccesary - or seems so -  and who are you referring to?

Indeed, who?  The US confronting Vietnam by bombing the hell out of it and
overthrowing Allende (democratically elected) or the British sinking a
warship thus drowning thousands of young Argentinians  and Murdoch (thru his
paper ) roaring "Gotcha!", the US bombing Afghanistan and leaving it  now in
charge of more corrupt Warlords than were there before (always the US leaves
things in a worse condition wherever they bomb another country (mines
everywhere, drug output put sales increased) (they always bomb: there are
harly ever any fighting by US soldiers - they might get killed, cant have
that - the left wing confronting people who cant stand certain "realities"?
In some cases its a wake up call: the Jews and the German Liberals and The
Left etc in the SWW left it too late and ended up fried in ovens.

None of this means that there arent equally a lot of "bad eggs" outiside the
US some of whom may heave done the Towers for reasons that are purely that
of mad Theocracy: that is a possibility....I would also turn to Swift with
his Big Endians and Little Endians ....mind you  conflict  East and West has
been going on for centuries....right back to the Crusades. ? Maybe we're
(myself included) just simply fucked in the head - maybe Van Gogh was right:
there will never be any human happiness....whoa! get out of your cups
Richard!!...??!!?...or there is some truth in what you say Nick...who
knows...!?!??   What does Harry Nudel and Ron and Patrick etal think about
all this ...I'm enjoying his (Sir Tennyson Ron Silliman's Blogg with its
intense poetics when I get the time but I dont think he wades in (perhaps
wisely) into the political or sticks and stones: he's not a stick man!! Or
not mainly...!!  Implic: we should maybe "do" more poetics and less
politcs..after all Iraqis are not Kiwis or Yanks maybe they dont count...???
Let's get "real" or unreal as the case may or may not be.....

We sometimes need to face realities. (Bad word "reality" i dont know what to
do with it...(not the obvious!)) Hazlitt went went mad didnt he? I think he
(I think it was Lamb who did) was a victim (partly ) of the capitalism and
corruption described by Dickens so brilliantly and it continues on even in
the 20th to the 21st Century.

Beautiful writing you quoted : and you are a very sensitive person Nick and
a great poet: that I cant deny.

I love hazlitt and Lamb and other essayisyts of that time and there is a lot

are two favourites.

Stephen, do you mean "Watching the Detectives"? Sure is
worth a quote anyway:

You think you're alone until you realize you're in it
Now your fear is here to stay; love is here for a visit
They call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
Someone's scratching at the window -- I wonder who is it?
The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
Who are ready to hear the worst
              about their daughter's disappearance
Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
It only took my little fingers to blow you away

Just like watching the detectives
It's so cute
It's just like watching the detectives
When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot



Best,
Damian

Oh, of course I did that too, Steven. I inquired of Dennis re Pitt's sales
figures for DEFENSE. But I was also curious about those Amazon rankings,
how they work, if and to what extent they're accurate, etc.

Precisely!

I had a lecturer who said or quoted  "Ashbery's as funny as a crashed train"
but everything can be funny: (and especially daffy Duck in Hollywood and
Variations on Ella Wheeer and A VERMONT NOTE BOOK) etc are hilarious and  I
think that that latter book is brilliant, one of the best poetry books:
often in fact (as you know and I know you know!) the reason we laugh is not
in sense because its funny or (we/you/they) are shadenfreuding... (always)
and sometimes and on the other side of things we say things that are to
"shock" people: those people wanted to get "depth" from Ashbery ...and I
know how they might feel - but a humorous response doesnt gainsay "depth" or
intensity...it can be cathartic for example... but I've given readings and
these days (at firsrt I was disconcerted) I like it when people laugh: it
kind of means people are enjoying what one has written ...after all who'se
to judge, its only words any case, lets not get too knotted about words
marvellous as they are... ...Ashbery probably preferred someone laughing
than a lot of straight shirts farting silently and trying to look oh so
intelligent: but THATS maybe a distortion...the black-suited people there
may have been new to the scene or ...well it is true that laughing can be
annoying: but they should have chuckled too.

As to Wallace Stevens I think that whoever taught him to me  was very good
but didnt emphasise the comic element although obviously the Emporer of Ice
Cream and the Worms at Heaven's gate are funny (very comical) ...What about
dante's   "Divine Comedy"...his vision of Hell etc finally is hilarious...in
a sense.(Peopel swimming around in shit forever and so on...) (Bush and Bin
Laden copulating and turning into monstors and burning and then re-arising
only to be joined together at the hip : forever!!!)

I had a book on W Stevens and that writer (forget who) emphasied in one
chapter the comic element of Stevens.

Without trivialising: humour can break through barriers and open one up to
"seriousness"...as you say _comic_ is a serious subject: in a funny way,
you're right.

Something hilarious and withering at the same time: the cover of the last(?)

by all means argue with her, but do be coherent about it; and "middle class

You secretly despise the poor and the old. You loathe
everything unwashed and slow. The daze that falls like
an unkind sheet over them when they enter the store...
        Days unravel, dog-eared and threadbare, spinning over
and against such heaps. Things salted melt into plasm
as hands forget the the cost of motion in December.
        With detritus for skin. Deep empty rooms for eyes.

Re-mind-er:

Anyone who wishes to read something -- yr own poetry/prose or somebody
else's -- is welcome to participate in the Rust Talks event.  The list below
is simply a compilation of those who rsvp'd me in response to the original
invitation.  The concept behind the reading/thinking is exploratory: What
might anti-war literature look like today, in a time quite different than
the 60s/70s, the period we reflexively think of when discussing an anti-war
movement.  How has theory/poetics changed how we approach this subject?
What's at stake here?

See you tomorrow night (Thurs, Dec 5), 8PM Rust Belt Books, 202 Allen
Street.  Don't miss it!

PS: Please note the additions to the list below.

The ice on Staples Mill lake cradles messages from
frowning parchment trees whose dreams twist like
infants' fists around eternities of water slipping
out. It collects them in packets and shoots them  to
the stars. Somewhere there is a race with just such
transmissions for blood. To them, the threshold
murmurs of plantlife are a delicate pornography.
        Today I replace the inflation of my veins with coffee
sweetened by instant breakfast powder.  Not a grain of
sugar in the house dazes Baby the way I transmit
memory to Baby through each elastic touch that teases
shape for the morning from a sleep that ices  cars to
steam.  One packet is a bundle of silent agonies; very
poor, older than the present,  the grains I drink from
have been filtered for days.  A thin, hardly rousing
punch; slapping my feelings to a screen's dimensions
for want of an image of Baby I cherish and drag
through music.
        Baby carries the whole sleep of December trees
dancing to silence.

Ivan Illich, 76, Philosopher Who Challenged Status Quo, Is Dead

December 4, 2002
By DOUGLAS MARTIN



Ivan Illich, a onetime Roman Catholic priest who, through a
steady flow of books and articles preached counterintuitive
sociology to a disquieted baby-boom generation, died on
Monday at his home in Bremen, Germany. He was 76.

Celia Samerski, a student of his at the University of
Bremen, said the specific cause of death was not known. She
said he also had a home in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

Mr. Illich was perhaps best known for his 1971 book,
"De-Schooling Society," which protested mandatory public
education and the institutionalization of learning. Along
with works like Paul Goodman's, "Growing Up Absurd:
Problems of Youth in the Organized Society," published in
1960, it provided grist for a society's growing ambivalence
about educational institutions and much else.

Mr. Illich was a priest who thought there were too many
priests, a lifelong educator who argued for the end of
schools and an intellectual sniper from a perch with a wide
view. He argued that hospitals cause more sickness than
health, that people would save time if transportation were
limited to bicycles and that historians who rely on
previously published material perpetuate falsehoods.

His intellectual ordnance of anarchist panache, hatred of
bureaucracy, Jesuitic argumentation, deep reverence for the
past and watered-down Marxism, was applied to many targets,
including relations between the sexes. More often than not,
his conclusions were startling: he thought life was better
for women in pre-modern times.

Critics often picked holes in his complex, verbose
arguments, but not a few hailed them as illuminating
critiques of large problems. Anatole Broyard, writing in
The New York Times in 1971, said that his nitpicks were
"like criticizing the grammar of someone who has just
delivered a speech that gave us goose pimples."

But after his 1970's heyday, interest in Mr. Illich's ideas
appeared to wane. Speaking invitations declined, and even
some that still came dripped with nostalgia: Mayor Jerry
Brown of Oakland, who was called Governor Moonbeam when he
was governor of California and consorted with
out-of-the-box thinkers like R. Buckminster Fuller and Mr.
Illich, invited him to a conference in 2000.

By 1989, Mr. Broyard wrote in an article about winnowing
books from his library that he would "especially" discard
Mr. Illich's works.

Mr. Illich was born on Sept. 4, 1926, in Vienna. He is
survived by two brothers, Micha, of Manhattan. and Sascha,
of Nantucket, Mass.

His father, a civil engineer, descended from Dalmatian
royalty. His mother was a Sephardic Jew, and Ivan was
expelled from a school in Vienna in 1941 because of her
background. He went on to study in Florence and Rome and in
Salzburg, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the
historian Arnold Toynbee.

Mr. Illich came to the Washington Heights neighborhood of
Manhattan in 1952 after being ordained as a priest in Rome.
He particularly attended to the needs of Puerto Ricans,
helping establish an employment agency among other things.
In an interview with The New Yorker magazine in 1970, the
Rev. John Connolly, one of his colleagues, called him
"their Babe Ruth."

The article said that early in his career as a priest,
Father Illich began to criticize the church for "its
smugness, its bureaucracy and its chauvinism." But his
energy and intellect propelled him to the position of vice
rector of the Catholic University of Ponce in Puerto Rico.
He was forced out in 1960 for opposing the local bishop's
forbidding of Catholics to vote for a governor who
advocated state-sponsored birth control.

After being recalled briefly to New York, he was assigned
to Cuernavaca, a small city 50 miles west of Mexico City
where he established the Intercultural Center for
Documentation to teach priests and laymen who wanted to
become Latin American volunteers.

Mr. Illich's criticisms of church doctrine ranged beyond
his advocacy of birth control, and in 1969 he was branded
"politically immoral" by the Vatican and left the
priesthood.

Among other things, he disagreed with the church policy of
increasing the number of priests in Latin America. He
believed that the church could be revived only by lay
people, a populist view that he later applied first to
education and then to other institutions.

"Illich is not against schools or hospitals as such, but
once a certain threshold of institutionalization is
reached, schools make people more stupid, while hospitals
make them sick," wrote Matthias Finger and Jose Manuel
Asu'n in "Adult Education at the Crossroads: Learning Our
Way Out" (Zed Books, 2001).

"And more generally, beyond a certain threshold of
institutionalized expertise, more experts are
counterproductive - they produce the counter effect of what
they set out to achieve," they continued.

Mr. Illich's sweeping conclusions struck some readers as
too sweeping, and others as plain wrong. Peter Sparkman in
The New York Times Book Review in 1971 criticized
"De-Schooling Society" as not only "a mind-bending litany
of abstraction" but as a distraction from schools' all too
real problems. He called it "an exceedingly bad book
written by an exceedingly good man."

But Mr. Illich relished surprise, and his ideas almost
always did. "We must have a sarcastic readiness for all
surprises," he said in The New Yorker interview, "including
the ultimate surprise of death."

i bet YOU didn't know that i can't see Benjamin Franklin's house from my
window in Philadelphia!  but now you do.  isn't that nice?  see, neither of
us can see our Big Bens from our windows.  and now we both know it.  what a
magical world it is.

This kind of moralizing, of course, is way long out of literary fashion, I
guess is doubly out of fashion, after modernism and post modernism.  What
consoles me in this has to do with what consoles me in say, Freud, Orwell,
Aldous Huxley, and more recently, Karen Horney, Winnicott and Heinz Kohut.
Each in their own way tried to specify the causes of what in earlier
moralistic philosophizing might have been called the question of evil. The
problem with tossing out the concept of God and Satan- mythical
personifications I personally find not useful- is that you are left with
finding a way of accounting for, and dealing with, human destructiveness.
Freud, in particular, was haunted by the responsibility for accounting for
aggression, having written -The Future of An Illusion- and having taken on
the role of establishing a metapsychological foundation for psychoanalysis.
Hazlitt, it seems to me, was ahead of the pack on much of this. He doesn't
have to resort to an inborn physical or external metaphysical cause of human
hurtfulness. He locates it where it belongs- in the culture, specifically at
times in British culture (I've quoted only very briefly from this essay)-
and also specifically addresses in this essay, which is called " On The
Pleasure of Hating" some of the aspects that have to do with literary
culture.

Thanks, Stephen, for your kind words about my post.

Brings to mind that wonderful speech in Tom Stoppard's
*New-Found-Land* in which Bernard sez to Arthur,

"Presently, Big Ben was heard to strike ten o'clock. Lloyd
George at once asked me whether it was possible to see
Big Ben from the upstairs window. I said that it was not.
'Surely you're wrong,' he said, 'are you absolutely certain?'
'Absolutely certain, Prime Minister.' He replied that he
found it difficult to believe and would like to see for
himself. I assured him that there was no need. The fact
was, my mother was upstairs in bed making out her
dinner table: she had the understandable, though to me
unwelcome, desire to show me off during my leave. Lloyd
George pressed the point, and finally said, 'I will bet you
£5 that I can see Big Ben from Marjorie's window.' 'Very
well,' I said, and we went upstairs. I explained to my
mother that the Prime Minister and I had a bet on. She
received us gaily, just as though she were in her drawing
room, Lloyd Geoge went to the window and pointed.
'Bernard,' he said, 'I see from Big Ben that it is four
minutes past the hour. The £5 which you have lost,' he
continued, 'I will spend on vast quantities of flowers for
your mother by way of excusing this intrusion. It is small
price to pay,' he said, 'for the lesson that you must never
pit any of the five Anglo-Saxon senses against the Celtic
sixth sense.' 'Prime Minister,' I said, 'I'm afraid Welsh
intuition is no match for English cunning. Big Ben in the
name of the bell, not the clock.' He paid up at once . . .
. . . and that was a fiver which I can tell you I have never
spent."

Thanks, Nick, for your fuller consideration. I guess, for me - and I am much
less well read in these areas than you - is how not to yield (or, at least,
how does one relate) to the depths of this darkness. It's, as we used to
say, "a total downer." How to acknowledge one's own, as well as the darkness
of others, and still come up breathing. In terms of poetry and/or languages
(as say, different, hopping entirely into a religious box.) What is it about
the rhythm, materiality of language, etc. that light or ignite a
counter-posing fire?
I suspect this discussion is all taking place against the invasion of war
into the daily consciousness - the clouds and anxiety of it - all helpfully
fed by George W and his companions joined at the hip with a media invested
in describing the technological elegance of killer weapons -  ever so
elegantly delivered out of our collective soul (the place of which Hazlitt
is articulate).
Parenthetically, last night I wandered accidentally into the Veternan's
Hospital of 40th and Lake in the Presidio here in San Francisco. (I was
lost. I was trying to get to another Veteran's hospital that is now occupied
by non-profit art groups in the part of the Presidio that is now a National
park.) It was early evening, dark, and when I went into the working hospital
- all shiny black and white linoleum patterns and fresh painted walls -  in
the the waiting room, and wandering up and down the halls, were veterans
who, in terms of age, ranged from WWII, Korea and Vietnam. Swollen stomachs,
amputated arms, wheel chairs, amber plastic bottles of multiple-meds you
name it - it was like walking through a hall of ghosts in which history (the
devastation) came back suddenly like a psychic bullet. I left without asking
further instructions. (& maybe a good thought to Whitman as nurse providing
soul-care among Civil War soldiers)
Where was I going? To hear a talk - a quite wonderful one - by Diane
Middlebrook on her new biography in progress, "Her Husband" about the
relationship of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. A different kind of violence,
one born of romance - though violence  was not Middlebrook's relish - but
the strength of the relationship when it was about the two young poets
working off each other and challenging each other's example to create
stronger work (which exhausted itself and took a turn with young children).
And then a career (his) ironically wed to her presence and her work - at the
mercy of her shadow.
All this keeps me thinking of Sartre's "No Exit".  A title which, as our
Bushmaster takes us "forward" into the next one - the fourth big one of my
life (not including the Central American stuff) seems inescapably true and,
again, grim and dark.

Which takes me back to the original concern - language as navigation through
all of this. Win, lose or draw?

But, I hasten to add, it's a really really GOOD BA. That's what gets me,
there's no parity. My BA is better than some (most?) MAs, but no one
counts that. It's all about who's able to swallow the most fecal material
for the longest period of time, IMHO.

Ivan Illich, 76, Philosopher Who Challenged Status Quo, Is Dead

December 4, 2002
By DOUGLAS MARTIN






Ivan Illich, a onetime Roman Catholic priest who, through a
steady flow of books and articles preached counterintuitive
sociology to a disquieted baby-boom generation, died on
Monday at his home in Bremen, Germany. He was 76.

Celia Samerski, a student of his at the University of
Bremen, said the specific cause of death was not known. She
said he also had a home in Cuernavaca, Mexico.

Mr. Illich was perhaps best known for his 1971 book,
"De-Schooling Society," which protested mandatory public
education and the institutionalization of learning. Along
with works like Paul Goodman's, "Growing Up Absurd:
Problems of Youth in the Organized Society," published in
1960, it provided grist for a society's growing ambivalence
about educational institutions and much else.

Mr. Illich was a priest who thought there were too many
priests, a lifelong educator who argued for the end of
schools and an intellectual sniper from a perch with a wide
view. He argued that hospitals cause more sickness than
health, that people would save time if transportation were
limited to bicycles and that historians who rely on
previously published material perpetuate falsehoods.

His intellectual ordnance of anarchist panache, hatred of
bureaucracy, Jesuitic argumentation, deep reverence for the
past and watered-down Marxism, was applied to many targets,
including relations between the sexes. More often than not,
his conclusions were startling: he thought life was better
for women in pre-modern times.

Critics often picked holes in his complex, verbose
arguments, but not a few hailed them as illuminating
critiques of large problems. Anatole Broyard, writing in
The New York Times in 1971, said that his nitpicks were
"like criticizing the grammar of someone who has just
delivered a speech that gave us goose pimples."

But after his 1970's heyday, interest in Mr. Illich's ideas
appeared to wane. Speaking invitations declined, and even
some that still came dripped with nostalgia: Mayor Jerry
Brown of Oakland, who was called Governor Moonbeam when he
was governor of California and consorted with
out-of-the-box thinkers like R. Buckminster Fuller and Mr.
Illich, invited him to a conference in 2000.

By 1989, Mr. Broyard wrote in an article about winnowing
books from his library that he would "especially" discard
Mr. Illich's works.

Mr. Illich was born on Sept. 4, 1926, in Vienna. He is
survived by two brothers, Micha, of Manhattan. and Sascha,
of Nantucket, Mass.

His father, a civil engineer, descended from Dalmatian
royalty. His mother was a Sephardic Jew, and Ivan was
expelled from a school in Vienna in 1941 because of her
background. He went on to study in Florence and Rome and in
Salzburg, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the
historian Arnold Toynbee.

Mr. Illich came to the Washington Heights neighborhood of
Manhattan in 1952 after being ordained as a priest in Rome.
He particularly attended to the needs of Puerto Ricans,
helping establish an employment agency among other things.
In an interview with The New Yorker magazine in 1970, the
Rev. John Connolly, one of his colleagues, called him
"their Babe Ruth."

The article said that early in his career as a priest,
Father Illich began to criticize the church for "its
smugness, its bureaucracy and its chauvinism." But his
energy and intellect propelled him to the position of vice
rector of the Catholic University of Ponce in Puerto Rico.
He was forced out in 1960 for opposing the local bishop's
forbidding of Catholics to vote for a governor who
advocated state-sponsored birth control.

After being recalled briefly to New York, he was assigned
to Cuernavaca, a small city 50 miles west of Mexico City
where he established the Intercultural Center for
Documentation to teach priests and laymen who wanted to
become Latin American volunteers.

Mr. Illich's criticisms of church doctrine ranged beyond
his advocacy of birth control, and in 1969 he was branded
"politically immoral" by the Vatican and left the
priesthood.

Among other things, he disagreed with the church policy of
increasing the number of priests in Latin America. He
believed that the church could be revived only by lay
people, a populist view that he later applied first to
education and then to other institutions.

"Illich is not against schools or hospitals as such, but
once a certain threshold of institutionalization is
reached, schools make people more stupid, while hospitals
make them sick," wrote Matthias Finger and Jose Manuel
Asu'n in "Adult Education at the Crossroads: Learning Our
Way Out" (Zed Books, 2001).

"And more generally, beyond a certain threshold of
institutionalized expertise, more experts are
counterproductive - they produce the counter effect of what
they set out to achieve," they continued.

Mr. Illich's sweeping conclusions struck some readers as
too sweeping, and others as plain wrong. Peter Sparkman in
The New York Times Book Review in 1971 criticized
"De-Schooling Society" as not only "a mind-bending litany
of abstraction" but as a distraction from schools' all too
real problems. He called it "an exceedingly bad book
written by an exceedingly good man."

But Mr. Illich relished surprise, and his ideas almost
always did. "We must have a sarcastic readiness for all
surprises," he said in The New Yorker interview, "including
the ultimate surprise of death."

DOW ADDRESSES BHOPAL OUTRAGE, EXPLAINS POSITION
Company responds to activist concerns with concrete action points

In response to growing public outrage over its handling of the Bhopal
disaster's legacy, Dow Chemical (http://www.dow-chemical.com) has
issued a statement explaining why it is unable to more actively
address the problem.

"We are being portrayed as a heartless giant which doesn't care about
the 20,000 lives lost due to Bhopal over the years," said Dow
President and CEO Michael D. Parker. "But this just isn't true. Many
individuals within Dow feel tremendous sorrow about the Bhopal
disaster, and many individuals within Dow would like the corporation
to admit its responsibility, so that the public can then decide on the
best course of action, as is appropriate in any democracy.

"Unfortunately, we have responsibilities to our shareholders and our
industry colleagues that make action on Bhopal impossible. And being
clear about this has been a very big step."

On December 3, 1984, Union Carbide--now part of Dow--accidentally
killed 5,000 residents of Bhopal, India, when its pesticide plant
sprung a leak.  It abandoned the plant without cleaning it up, and
since then, an estimated 15,000 more people have died from
complications, most resulting from chemicals released into the
groundwater.

Although legal investigations have consistently pinpointed Union
Carbide as culprit, both Union Carbide and Dow have had to publicly
deny these findings. After the accident, Union Carbide compensated
victims' families between US$300 and US$500 per victim.

"We understand the anger and hurt," said Dow Spokesperson Bob Questra.
"But Dow does not and cannot acknowledge responsibility. If we did,
not only would we be required to expend many billions of dollars on
cleanup and compensation--much worse, the public could then point to
Dow as a precedent in other big cases. 'They took responsibility; why
can't you?' Amoco, BP, Shell, and Exxon all have ongoing problems that
would just get much worse. We are unable to set this precedent for
ourselves and the industry, much as we would like to see the issue
resolved in a humane and satisfying way."

Shareholders reacted to the Dow statement with enthusiasm. "I'm happy
that Dow is being clear about its aims," said Panaline Boneril, who
owns 10,000 shares, "because Bhopal is a recurrent problem that's
clogging our value chain and ultimately keeping the share price from
expressing its full potential. Although a real solution is not
immediately possible because of Dow's commitments to the larger
industry issues, there is new hope in management's exceptional new
clarity on the matter."

"It's a slow process," said Questra. "We must learn bit by bit to meet
this challenge head-on. For now, this means acknowledging that much as
it pains us, our prime responsibilities are to the people who own Dow
shares, and to the industry as a whole. We simply cannot do anything
at this moment for the people of Bhopal."


Dow Chemical is a chemical products and services company devoted to
bringing its customers a wide range of chemicals. It furnishes
solutions for the agriculture, electronics, manufacturing, and oil and
gas industries, including well-known products like Styrofoam, DDT, and
Agent Orange, as well as lesser-known brands like Inspire, Retain,
Eliminator, Quash, and Woodstalk. For more on the Bhopal catastrophe,

victims' families between US$300 and US$500 per victim.

"We understand the anger and hurt," said Dow Spokesperson Bob Questra.
"But Dow does not and cannot acknowledge responsibility. If we did,
not only would we be required to expend many billions of dollars on
cleanup and compensation--much worse, the public could then point to
Dow as a precedent in other big cases. 'They took responsibility; why
can't you?' Amoco, BP, Shell, and Exxon all have ongoing problems that
would just get much worse. We are unable to set this precedent for
ourselves and the industry, much as we would like to see the issue
resolved in a humane and satisfying way."

Shareholders reacted to the Dow statement with enthusiasm. "I'm happy
that Dow is being clear about its aims," said Panaline Boneril, who
owns 10,000 shares, "because Bhopal is a recurrent problem that's
clogging our value chain and ultimately keeping the share price from
expressing its full potential. Although a real solution is not
immediately possible because of Dow's commitments to the larger
industry issues, there is new hope in management's exceptional new
clarity on the matter."

"It's a slow process," said Questra. "We must learn bit by bit to meet
this challenge head-on. For now, this means acknowledging that much as
it pains us, our prime responsibilities are to the people who own Dow
shares, and to the industry as a whole. We simply cannot do anything
at this moment for the people of Bhopal."


Dow Chemical is a chemical products and services company devoted to
bringing its customers a wide range of chemicals. It furnishes
solutions for the agriculture, electronics, manufacturing, and oil and
gas industries, including well-known products like Styrofoam, DDT, and
Agent Orange, as well as lesser-known brands like Inspire, Retain,
Eliminator, Quash, and Woodstalk. For more on the Bhopal catastrophe,

One of my sons tonight asked me how come they only target the
African-American laureates to go after? So we had a discussion about why
Daniel Hoffman, Pennsylvania's laureate, has never offended anyone.

     While i think it's ludicrous for Quincy Troupe to need any credentials to
practice his craft and to teach others to do it so well that they too can make
140 grand a year for part time work. I wish Ron had focused on teaching his
son what a leading question is rather than indoctrinating him into the
politics of po. The Baraka file is coming up in the state legislature
tomorrow,& i'm sure we'll click on the results by the evening.

      The Troupe affair is somewhat like the plagiarism cases against Doris
Kearns Godwin, Susan Sontag & that WWII popular historian whose name escapes
me, in that they are supercially about intellectual integrity, but more
interestingly about the public need to lay  low the all too high & mighty.

      It most resembles the Ellis bruhaha at Amherst. Ellis for reasons only
known to him manufactured a warrior  career to put beside his scholarly
pursuits. Troupe was fired from UCSD not for manufacturing acadmeic
credentials, but superflously adding some imaginary course work about which he
wasn't even axed. I can spout psychological cliches about both their
motivations,  but won;t. Black & White...East & West...they both got canned.

      By tomorrow every one on this list will be with Eileen Myles on the
right side of this issue. Alack alas maybe they can explain the byzantine
politics of Black Po. Is Mr. Troupe being pensioned off or is he like the rest
of us left to the freezing dog all dark nite of capitalism..Harry..

***********************


Interview with Alan Sondheim
by August Highland
(this interview will appear on valentine's
day 2003 in the "m.a.g. special edition" featuring
alan sondheim)
www.muse-apprentice-guild.com



August Highland: How do you characterize the difference between your
previously
work and your new poetry?

Alan Sondheim: I see one leading into the other; I was doing 'interference'
computer work
and programming back in the 70s already. I'm not sure btw that my work is
'poetry' - it's texting, languaging, of one form or another. My concerns
shift constantly; I keep wanting a 'definitive' text - which is what the
sophia text ultimately is - a text that outlines a philosophical position
by a process of accretion.

AH: Was there a context or turning-point that you consider to have been the
catalyst
for the new direction in your current work?

AS: That context or turning-point was decades ago, when I knew Clark
Coolidge
and Aram Saroyan - they helped push me, or allowed me to push myself. My
work has always been 'wayward,' disruptive, contrary, and off-and-on
sexualized; it's also been philosophical and what I consider 'resonant' -
in the sense that every work capitulates the others.

AH: How would you introduce a new reader to the work you are
presently working on?

AS: Probably ask him or her to try and read it as trance-work; it will come
after a while, begin to make sense. Short-waves and long-waves will appear
and disappear. One reader told me that the words ultimately seemed to come
to him from himself - not from the text; this is a good idea of the
writing.

AH: What terms would you use to describe your work
to the type of reader who wants to categorize your work and
specify its genre?

AS: Genreless, composed of 'codework,' aphoristic, philosophy; 'wryting' in
the sense that it problematizes the body and its presence within the text.

AH: What do you deem your most significant work to date
or, to put the question another way, to which work do you
attribute the most personal value?

AS: Other than various parts of the Internet Text, probably the sophia.text
for the first part of the question, and the cancer.txt, about the death of
my mother, for the second part.

AH: Do your regularly correspond with other writers and if so
on what basis did your relationship evolve - was it on the affinity
of your aesthetic approaches or on your personal compatibility
or a combination of both?

AS: I'm always in touch with certain people - Leslie Thornton, the
film/video-
maker, Tom Zummer, artist, writer, theorist, Ellen Zweig, artist, writer,
and numerous online people. The first three help me tremendously; I owe
them a great deal.

AH: Do you enjoy presenting public readings of your work?

AS: Yes - recently there have been so many different venues - video - at the
Robert Beck Memorial Cinema; laptop performance at a number of places
(Minneapolis, Bass Museum, Cosh-Coch); sound (Flying Saucer Cafe); and
these mix with straight-forward readings.

AH: Are you a disciplined writer with a regular work schedule?

AS: I write/video/image daily - from, say, 4 to 12 hours.

AH: Did you or do you still have literary mentors whom you admire
and who have supported your literary development?

AS: Not recently; years ago there was Clark of course, and very early on,
I.A.
Richards sent me a very encouraging letter. I still like his Practical
Criticism. There are people I've felt close to at times - Vito Acconci,
Bernadette Mayer, Stelarc - none now. I'm influenced by Kathy Acker (with
whom I worked), Jabes, Blanchot, Adorno, Celan - you get the picture. As
well as Derrida, Irigaray, the physicists David Finkelstein, David Bohm,
John Wheeler, etc.

AH: Conversely do you have any close associations with younger writers
whose development as a writer you are supporting and nurturing?

AS: Various people online and off. There are a number of people who really
excite me; as associate editor of Beehive and occasional contributor to
Florian Cramer's Unstable Digest, I get to offer online opportunities at
times. I've also done anthologies, etc.

AH: Every writer wants immortality and to make an historically significant
contribution to the western literary tradition - what do you feel your
principle
contribution has been up to this point in your professional literary career?

AS: None yet, in terms of acceptance. The development of a new language and
approach to writing - as well as an investigation into the phenomenologi-
cal roots of writing - in general.

AH: Which writer or writers do you admire whose work you
believe is being undeservedly overlooked?

AS: This is difficult for me - there are so many writers who excite me.
Perhaps Takuboku - author of Romaji Diary - and Seitatsu - at least in
terms of a western audience. I lot of theorists... older ones such as
Shestov and Sartre for example - I don't hear much about Lingis now who I
love. People like Lucan, Juvenal. Current writers like Marc-Alain Ouaknin.

AH: To what activity do you enjoy the most devoting your time
when you are not working?

AS: I'm pretty much always working. I'll watch tv for relaxation, but it's
usually background. I read constantly. I take a computer or digital
recorder with me wherever I go. Sometimes a digital still or video camera.
All this plays into my work.

AH: What question(s) would you have liked for me to have asked you
and what is (are) your answer(s)?

AS: Perhaps what is my attitude towards new media? To which I'd reply I work
on ideas, and the media come out of this. In terms of music, I'm
interested in the labor of production, and speed - playing as fast as
possible - as a way to inscribe the body into the work. Video allows me
the greatest lattitude - a way to involve the subject almost in the 'flow'
of the work through projection. And laptop performance/projection gives me
a way to inscribe myself into the audience, and to introject their
reactions - in the midst of image-streams.

Finally, politics? - yes, everywhere; we are heading towards an almost
uncanny brutality in the United States, based on a combination of paranoia
and mourning; this must be fought everywhere and constantly.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I hope some of these Buffalo anti-war poetry
readers/explorers report back on the event.  I'm very
curious: Tim's question ("What might anti-war
literature look like today, in a time quite different
than the 60s/70s, the period we reflexively think of
when discussing an anti-war movement.  How has
theory/poetics changed how we approach this subject?
What's at stake here?") couldn't be more timely to our
agreed purpose of poetics nor, to me, more
bewildering. I wanted to follow up on Joe Safdie's
recent post about the same problem ("imaginative art
that can incorporate some response to -- and even
provide a chronicle of -- this recent chain of
terrifying events. I feel that the poets alive today
will eventually be seen as among the most shameful
practitioners of the art if we don't produce such
work"; see

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0211&L=poetics&P=R50484&I=-3&m=57246),

but it was a topic no one pursued.  I tracked down
Barrett Watten's ~Critical Inquiry~ essay, "The Turn
toward Language in the 60s," and Andrea Brady's
less-harsh-on-Language-Poetry-than-originally-reported
"Grief" essay in ~Radical Philosophy,~ hoping for some
guiding light,--- but was left just as mystified (W.S.
Merwin's opacity, a precursor to Language Poetry??)
and stymied by the trail of cookie crumbs leading
further into a dark forest with the Charles Altieri
reference that only elsewhere would prove why Denise
Levertov's political transparency had become laughable
and unsupportable.

Recently, I went through a series of back-channels
with someone who wrote me exhorting that any future
issues of the journal that I edited, LOGOPOEIA

( http://www.logopoeialogopoeia.da.ru/ ),

dedicate it more to a recommitment to

            political poetry,

a "dare" I still find myself baffled over, ---as no
one in fact seems to be ~writing~ that kind of poetry,
at least in explicit/content-based terms.  ...Or, as
Altieri may have said, that it leads almost
immediately into "bad" poetry.

Joe wrote that "abstract and apolitical lyrics flood
this listserv", and, among other question marks, I was
left wondering--- whether by "abstract" what he wasn't
rather hitting upon might be that Pater's dictum of
"all arts aspire to the condition of music" has in
fact been ~reached~ in "our style" of poetry; and if
that plateau, which he sees as "abstract," doesn't
engender brand new problems as far as political
referentialism--- much like a composer of instrumental
music asking how new music could be political or
anti-war.  (Are those shadows of lumbering giants that
I hear Prokofiev orchestrating into the symphonies of
his that I've been listening to this week abstract
critiques of Stalinism?  Isn't the politics of
monarchy ~audible~ in the abstract music that the
Esterhazys commissioned?  ...And likewise an
anti-anti-semitism / anti-eugenic-exclusivism equally
materialized in the tonal all-inclusiveness of Second
Vienna School twelve-tonality, etc., etc., etc.?)

I wonder too, unlike the allegedly risible Levertov
poem that reported about her actual protesters' park
occupation experience, whether the first kind of new
anti-war or political poetry that facilely comes to
mind wouldn't in fact be poetry about ~media
representations~ of the political
(newspapers/television), and hence actually a boojum
of  ---excuse me--- Baudrillard's hyperreal, rather
than realpolitik.  I.e., is it political to say "This
is what I read in the newspaper"?

Etc.

Barrett Watten's recent post about Tanya and the
Simbionese Liberation Army as examples of "radical
irrationalism" was tantalizing,--- but it left the
reader desperately in need of elaboration: When Watten
says "I would propose that current social discourses
of terrorism derive from such events", was he
proposing it ~proscriptively,~ in the sense that what
the world (and poetry) needs now is a ~return~ to
Simbionese-style radical irrationalism, sweet radical
irrationalism, hence to build a political poetry upon
its own comedic ungroundedness,---

or did he mean that recuperation into
state-vs.-revolutionary irrationalism became the
subsequent discursive ~imprisonment~ that ~prevents~
political poetry?

I also tried reading Daniel Davidson's 2002 Krupskaya
book, ~Culture,~ because Ben Friedlander and Gary
Sullivan blurb it as being quintessentially political
(SPD catalog: "One question was foremost in his mind:
just how far can experimental be construed as direct
political action?"; B.F.: "Politics for Dan Davidson
was a site-specific performance art"),--- but, for me,
the book may have crossed over that "just how far"
line and ~no longer~ be so construable, as I was at a
near-total loss to recognize its hermetic
politicality.

The recurrent craving that these calls to a
neo-political poetry seem to be expressing is for a
poetry other than the formalism-as-politics that
Language Poetry so convincingly theorized.

So, I find myself thrown back upon the politicality of
minor canonical examples, like the proto-~Paradise~
neo-Latin "In Quintum Novembris" that the 17-year old
John Milton wrote in reaction to Guy Fawkes'
("terrorist") gunpowder plot to explode Parliament
House,--- which enacts its poetic politicism entirely
through an imagination of The Beyond: "You have it in
your power to scatter their dismembered bodies through
the air, to burn them to cinders, by exploding nitrous

("Atque dare in cineres, nitrati pulveris igne /
Aedibus iniecto, qua convenere, sub imis": trans. [?]
Merritt Y. Hughes, ~John Milton: Complete Poems and
Major Prose,~ p. 18).


I might mention the recent (failed?) attempt of the
e-journal http://www.newmediapoets.com/nmp.html, which
entered into its dedication to drumming up a new
political poetry with even a ~manifesto~ in tow,
against the anachronistic limbo of most current
poetry: "We are a movement of engagement. Always
engaged, we articulate our participation in a culture,
in an economy, in a particular country, now ... We see
beauty in nouns and names, proper and otherwise: Tiger
Woods ... We know these names to be within the
perimeters of the poetic...", however collecting
somewhat oblique work, itself.

(I should add, I genuinely do believe that the diptych
of poems Garrett Kalleberg published in LOGOPOEIA were
some of the first, best, "post-9/11" poetry I've read:
"I take a draw on a cigarette / which pulls a young
Pakistani man’s / hand holding an oiled cloth down the
length / of the barrel of a gun...".)

Has anyone read the O Books journal Enough that Leslie
Scalapino edited, which also addressed "anti-war
poetry" (SPD: "based on the theme 'Seeing is a form of
change,' this issue investigates warfare and the World
Trade Center bombing", with poetry by our A-List:
McClure, Notley, Bernstein, Davies, A. Berrigan,
Hofer, Joris, Darragh/Inman, Osman, etc., etc.,...)?

  Anyone who wishes to read something -- yr own

  else's -- is welcome to participate in the Rust
Talks event.  The list below
  is simply a compilation of those who rsvp'd me in
response to the original
  invitation.  The concept behind the reading/thinking
is exploratory: What
  might anti-war literature look like today, in a time
quite different than
  the 60s/70s, the period we reflexively think of when
discussing an anti-war
  movement.  How has theory/poetics changed how we
approach this subject?
  What's at stake here?

  See you tomorrow night (Thurs, Dec 5), 8PM Rust Belt

He leaned over and said, 'Take off your shirt.'

'No. Why?'

'I hunger only for you.'

I began to laugh. 'Go chew Mao quotations! Fill your stomach with them.
Come on! Chairman Mao teaches us. . . '

'"A thousand years is too long, seize the moment."' He grabbed me.
'Chairman Mao also teaches us, "A revolution is an insurrection, an act of
violence by which one class overthrows another."'

'Chairman Mao again teaches us' - I put down the buns and wrestled with
him - '"The situation must change. It is the task of the people of the
whole world to put an end to the aggression and oppression perpetrated by
imperialism."'

He went wild. '"If the US monopoly capitalist groups persist in pushing
their policies of aggression and war, the day is bound to come when they
will be hanged by the people of the whole world."' I could feel my body
blooming. I was unable to continue the reciting. 'Don't you stop, Maple!

Parties." Come on now!'

'"It is my opinion,"' I began, '"that the international situation has now

the pleasure was too overwhelming.

'Go on, Maple, go on. "There are two winds in the world today"' - he
caressed me, his hands cupping my breasts from behind - '"the East Wind and
the West Wind. There is a Chinese saying, Either the East Wind prevails
over the West Wind or the West Wind prevails over the East Wind."'

We were breathless. He insisted we continue reciting. I tasted his sweat as
I went on. '"It is characteristic of the situation today that the East Wind
is prevailing over the West Wind. That is to say, the forces of socialism
have become overwhelmingly superior to the forces of imperialism. . . "'

Our bodies came together again. . .

>... What's at stake here?") couldn't be more timely to our
>agreed purpose of poetics nor, to me, more bewildering.

It is bewildering. One question vis-a-vis anti-war poetry I have is what
does one expect from such a project? And who is expecting, what position do
they have with respect to any larger, potentially swayable audience, if
that's what one does, finally, expect--to sway? Need that enter into the
equation at all? In other words, does one expect more-or-less immediate
change, or to have one's work read at some point in the future, by others,
and potentially change/sway them? If the former, is it naive and doomed to
failure not to bring the question of audience in, and consider that in how
anything is made, distributed, talked and written about? Does it involve
having a well-put-together group as opposed to isolated, individual poets
"writing against"? And so on.

Joe Safdie's post seemed to have come out of Ammiel Alcalay's and Anne
Waldman's e-mail, also posted to the list, about getting together an active
group of poets who would ... well, I couldn't figure the last part out,
because I think they're maybe not totally sure about that either. It seemed
like they were looking for input, are still putting that aspect together.
But I noticed, in both that e-mail/post and Joe's, the word "shame" comes
up. It's an interesting word, in that, the moment you use it, perhaps more
sensitive/reactive people might feel already a twinge of it. My initial
impulse, reading both of those posts, although I'm certainly not against
what they may be proposing, was that I really wanted no part of any
"shaming" program. (My own knee-jerk reaction to anything that smacks of
puritanism.) But, also, unless human beings change radically, I can't see
how "the poets alive today will eventually be seen as among the most
shameful practitioners of the art if we don't produce such work." I'm not
sure how that would happen. And, ultimately, it seems like, if the work has
no legitimate political efficacy, then it's just, what is its worth,
besides, later, a kind of weird nostalgia thing, how we look now at Hannah
Hoch, for instance. She was a "good" artist, morally good. But who did her
art, at that time, convince? Change? Whose eyes, at that time, in that
culture, were opened? How many eyes? Was it enough? Obviously it was better
than nothing. But. Couldn't we strive for more? So the question of efficacy
seems like it's really got to be addressed, thought through, which includes,
I would guess, if that's what you're interested in doing, needing to address
one's own situation vis-a-vis audience.

My feeling, at least with respect to Joe's post, is that "this recent chain
of terrifying events" is no more or less terrifying (necessarily) than
almost any particular situation in recorded human history. I think,
post-9/11, artists & writers in the U.S. have become, if it's possible, even
more narcissistic/provincial than before. (I include myself in that, btw.)
And I don't mean simply in the sense of "our pain" or "our wake-up call,"
but more like, we've once again become culturally generally conscious of how
Roman we are, how Hellenistic, and there's a way in which we seem to return
to that, almost wallow in it. Which is a sticky subject because one wants to
be aware of what one's culture/government/own actions are doing, what effect
they have, but it also seems to me like we're (generally speaking) still
caught in this situation of *looking at ourselves* that--for me--winds up
becoming simply an acknowledgment (& by extension, an assertion) of "our"
"power."

Isn't there a way in which western culture critique ultimately strokes the
western ego, as powerful, warping factor? I don't mean wholly, but. When it
doesn't provide fully-realized alternatives. This is the culture
critic's/satirist's dilemma, generally, and may be the poet's as well. Ron
Silliman makes the point that the politics of disgust (and cynicism), for
instance, does not necessarily provide or open up alternatives for
organizing or (he says) writing critically. (I admit I was confused by that
at first, because "writing critically" doesn't seem necessarily different
from writing out of disgust. But I think he means *positively* critically,
"critical" not in the sense of "condemnation" but in the sense of "thinking
fully through." To some *end*.)

But, to me, being able to think something with global ramifications "fully
through," it seems like one has to know something about the rest of the
world. More than just something. One ought really to be immersed in it,
moreso probably than in one's own culture, if that's even possible (and it
might not be without moving). There's hardly a dearth of cultural criticism
out there, of satire, of politcally reactive art, including poetry. But just
try finding material on, say, Naseebo Laal in this culture, let alone
material that might contextualize what she does.  And how to incorporate
that, whatever you might find, along with everything else you might be
looking at, out there, and work it into your poetry in such a way that it's
not completely decontextualized?

For me, it's not the flood of abstract and apolitical lyrics that seems
troubling on this list--there's lots of political discussion that goes on
here. It's the lack of information, culture, reportage, exchange with
others--and I mean outside the U.S. (and not just Canada and Britain and
Australia and New Zealand and maybe France, though that's all good, too).
Anything posted here with respect to others, other cultures, rarely gets
picked up as a thread--it's usually commented on by one or two & then
dropped. We seem to have no way, *as a group*, of taking others in, in a
sense. We don't really welcome it in a way that it seems to ever go
anywhere, or it's probably more likely that we just don't, in this culture
(and I mean poetry community as well as U.S.A.) have any context for
"others." Not really.

The poets in the sixties involved in the war resistance were also, many of
them, it seemed like, also involved in opening up dialogues with other
cultures. It may or may not have ultimately been a successful project. (I
just read somewhere how too much poetry translated into English at that time
became warped into this weird U.S. sensibility--not quite sure if the charge
is accurate or not, though how something might get warped, is worth
considering.)

Last night at the Poetry Project, Douglas Rothschild read from a series of
poems, "The Minor Arcana," that reportedly began as phone calls, messages
left on Jordan Davis's answering machine. Instead of erasing them after
listening to them, Jordan transcribed them, or so the mythology goes.

Douglas recast the transcribed rants as poems. They're very transparent,
very much specific to this time and place, and anti-war. I thought they were
interesting, as no one that I know of--personally--right now is doing
anything quite that transparent, at least not specificly "anti-war," and not
as such an extended project. (Jordan's doing a project sort of related to
Douglas's, but it's not specifically anti-war.) There are moments of brutal
satire in Doug's piece--for instance, the idea he proposed that Palestinians
should wave American flags and hold up replicas of the statue of liberty
while tanks run them down--it would, so the logic goes, make Americans
suddenly "care" about them. But the series ultimately really gave me nothing
I hadn't been given by the media already, in terms of expanding whatever
sense I had of the people likely affected by current U.S. actions and
policy. And, in fact, the media, when I bother to check it out, has more
glimmers of "elsewhere" than were apparent in this series of poems.

There was something poignant about Douglas's reading them at the Project--in
other words, in a church, among believers ("poetry" and "leftist politics,
generally" believers, myself included). Two things nagged at me. Would
anyone's mind be changed by this stuff, was it anything I wasn't already
thinking, and would anyone whose mind might be changed have access to it?
And, there was no real attempt made to open doors leading "elsewhere." It
*is* cynical to believe that Americans will only be concerned about others
if they're waving U.S. flags. What about if they were given accurate
pictures of--and I don't mean just "photographs" or "footage" of, but really
extended explorations of the people and places our country's policies are
damaging? This is not to damn Douglas nor the audience--again, I was one of
them, and I was sympatico. Just that, it seemed ultimately to raise more
questions for me than opening up any doors, getting beyond this feeling I
have that we're still kind of this very narcissistic culture, not quite
ready yet to look beyond our borders. It *didn't* have the feeling, for me,
ultimately, of a fully "efficacious" project. As of yet, anyway. That might
not have been his point. I don't know. But that *seems* to be Joe's and
Ammiel's and Anne's. And no doubt many others'.

I don't say all of this as someone doing what he's preaching, but more am
just wondering about poetry and political efficacy, about resistance, and
wondering if anyone very much invested in the idea of poetry as political
instance/gesture/platform etc., or as potentially efficacious, well I wonder
how far they've gone in thinking through all of this in terms of
workability, the more pragmatic stuff maybe. I'm guessing there are people
who have. I guess it's true that I would really like to see something, some
gesture beyond reaction in political poetry. And there may be people working
on this, really thinking globally, incorporating everything it seems to me
you'd have to incorporate into one's work to provide more than critique.
What are people's thoughts about that? What's being done that someone could
tell us about or point to?

Today, WKCR is playing Mal Waldron recordings all day in a memorial to that
terrific composer and jazz musician who just died. I remembered that he is
mentioned in a classic poem by Frank O'Hara and thought it was from -Poem-
in which he writes "Lana Turner has collapsed!" But, of course, it is from

THE DAY LADY DIED

It is 12:20 in New York a Friday
three days after Bastille day, yes
it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine
because I will get off the 4:19 in Easthampton
at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner
and I don't know the people who will feed me

I walk up the muggy street beginning to sun
and have a hamburger and a malted and buy
an ugly NEW WORLD WRITING to see what the poets
in Ghana are doing these days
                    I go on to the bank
and Miss Stillwagon (first name Linda I once heard)
doesn't even look up my balance for once in her life
and in the GOLDEN GRIFFIN I go get a little Verlaine
for Patsy with drawings by Bonnard although I do
think of Hesiod, trans. Richard Lattimore or
Brendan Behan's new play or Le Balcon or Les Negres
of Genet, but I don't, I stick with Verlaine
after practically going to sleep with quandariness

and for Mike I just stroll into the PARK LANE
Liquor Store and ask for a bottle of Strega and
then I go back to where I came from to 6th Avenue
and the tobacconist in the Ziegfield Theatre and
casually ask for a carton of Gauloises and a carton
of Picayunes, and a NEW YORK POST with her face on it

and I am sweating a lot by now  and thinking of
leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT
while she whispered a song along the keyboard
to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing

                    -

I can't believe it is only today that I completely understood the point of
O'Hara evoking all these details of the moment he learned Billie Holiday
died. Of course it comes from the nearly universal experience of never
forgetting, including the permanent retaining of some vivid visual memories,
the day we experience a crucial trauma as in, of course, the classic knowing
where you were at the moment of learning of a great public tragedy- such as
the unforgettably upsetting day John Lennon was murdered.

Joel Felix, Loss Peque=F1o Glazier, Kenneth Goldsmith, Robert Kocik, Paige
Menton, George Quasha, Jonathan Skinner, and others.

WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 11 [8:00pm]
SHERMAN ALEXIE AND CHUCK WACHTEL
Sherman Alexie recently made a stunning debut as a director when he brought
his title The Business of Fancydancing out as an independent film. The movi=
e
has been voted Best Narrative Feature Film (Durango Film Festival) and also
received an Outstanding Screenwriting Award (OUTFEST). The Seattle Weekly
raves: "Every filmmaker should have such talent." Alexie has published 14
books to date, including his most recent collection of short stories, The
Toughest Indian in the World, and his newly released poetry collection, One
Stick Song. His several books of poetry include Old Shirts & New Skins
(UCLA) and The Summer of Black Widows (Hanging Loose Press). Shortly after
the publication of his first book, The Business of Fancydancing (a
collection of poetry and stories) Alexie was described as "one of the major
lyric voices of our time" in the New York Times Book Review. He was named
one of Granta's Best of Young American Novelists and won the Before Columbu=
s
Foundation's American Book Award and the Murray Morgan Prize for his first
novel, Reservation Blues, published in 1995 by Atlantic Monthly Press. His
second novel, Indian Killer, published in 1996 (also by Atlantic Monthly
Press) was named one of People's Best of Pages and a New York Times Notable
Book. A story from his first collection of short stories, The Lone Ranger
and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, was released as the movie Smoke Signals at
the Sundance Film Festival in January 1998; the movie won two awards: the
Audience Award and the Filmmakers Trophy. Alexie occasionally does readings
and stand-up performances with musician Jim Boyd, a Colville Indian. Alexie
and Boyd also collaborated to record the album Reservation Blues, which
contains the songs from the book of the same name. One of the Reservation
Blues songs, "Small World" (WAV), also appeared on Talking Rain: Spoken Wor=
d
& Music from the Pacific Northwest and Honor: A Benefit for the Honor the
Earth Campaign. In 1996 Boyd and Alexie opened for the Indigo Girls at a
concert to benefit the Honor the Earth Campaign. Alexie competed in his
first World Heavyweight Poetry Bout competition in June 1998. He went up
against world champion Jimmy Santiago Baca and won the Bout, and then went
on to win the title again over the next three years, becoming the first poe=
t
to hold the title for three and four consecutive years. He is the current
reigning World Heavyweight Poetry Bout Champion. In 1998, Alexie
participated with seven others in the PBS Lehrer News Hour Dialogue on Race
with President Clinton. The discussion was moderated by Jim Lehrer and
originally aired on PBS on July 9, 1998. In June 1999, The New Yorker
acknowledged Alexie as one of the top writers for the 21st Century. He was
one of twenty writers featured in the magazine's Summer Fiction Edition, "2=
0
Writers for the 21st Century."

Among Chuck Wachtel's books are the novels The Gates and Joe The Engineer,
which was awarded a PEN/Hemingway citation and has enjoyed multiple
reprintings; a collection of stories and novellas, Because We Are Here; and
five collections of poems and short prose including The Coriolis Effect and
What Happens to Me. He is presently at work on a nearly completed new novel=
,
River of Stars. His stories, poems, translations and essays have appeared i=
n
Hanging Loose, The Nation, The Village Voice, Up Late: American Poetry Sinc=
e
1970, 110 Stories: New York Writes After September 11th and numerous other
anthologies and magazines both here and abroad.

And I add: who the hell is Daniel Hoffman?

Right, OK, I just looked at his AAP page -- publications,
awards, trappings of officialdom -- he was even U.S.
Laureate-equivalent in the early 70s. "The Center of
Attention" is a fairly decent poem, somewhat painfully
literal, about a man trying to decide whether to jump off a
bridge, crowd watching:

And now each rung brings him nearer,
Nearer to their condition
Which is not sufficiently interesting
To detain them from business or idleness either,

Or is too close to a despair
They do not dare
Exhibit before a crowd
Or admit to themselves they share.

That lapse into rhyme is a bit strange, no? Cheesy like
a Broadway break-into-song? I'm being dense -- doesn't
Ashbery have a well-known poem about a man jumping off a
building? I'm always interested in putting two
subject-sharing poems together, esp. from "opposite camps"
-- anybody feel like reminding me what JA poem it is, and

One thought about that chimey stanza: it sorta speaks to
the whole political poetry question, in its way. When I say
"painfully literal" I'm copping to a certain attitude that
it's really impossible for me to un-learn at this point,
nor would I exactly want to -- i.e. a poetry that engages
the subject like prose just isn't interesting or effective.
But without that literalness, the only version of
"political poetry" that makes any sense to me at all is
what Jeffrey refers to as "the formalism-as-politics that
Language Poetry so convincingly theorized." Or maybe the
detournement stuff that Brian Kim Stefans and others have
been doing -- but then situationist art and poetry are not
nearly the same thing. I guess the detournement things to
me are the link between "abstract" poetry and direct
political discussion as manifested on this list -- a
continuum, where one side, I'm sure, though I can't quite
articulate how, feeds the other.

Nick,  Thanks for this.  I played Waldron's fantastic "Fire Waltz" for my
students today - O'Hara was, I'm pretty sure, there to hear it at the Five
Spot in 1961 (it coincided w/ a benefit that weekend for the Floating
Bear.)  Incidentally, for anyone who might be interested, my article
"Tribes of New York: Frank O'Hara, Amiri Baraka and the Poetics of the
Five Spot" (in Contemporary Literature 42.4) includes a reading of "The
Day Lady Died" where I argue for Waldron's importance to the poem - that
he figures there not just as Holiday's sometime piano man but, truer to
his actual role in the GV scene, as an important player in the new jazz
avant-garde, accompanying Dolphy, Booker Little, Mingus and Steve Lacy
among others during that period when O'Hara was a Five Spot regular.

heard story recently about hamilton college president, who cribbed
more than a couple speeches - a beloved, dedicated member of the
college community. somehow had some kind of "problem" causing him to
plagiarize his speeches. after he was forced to resign
(http://www.hamilton.edu/news/more_news/display.cfm?ID=5095) many
trustees attacked the faculty, saying he'd been singled out, many of
them arguing that in fact speeches are "different" from writing, etc.
anyhow- i raise the story because the problem is this perceived sense
of integrity, ethical code about originality(or honesty--and note
troupe's further comments after being questioned about it after the
scandal arose, comments which turned out not to be true) these values
seem like something to talk about - not so much to be dispensing with
this sense of propriety which motivates the hunger for it within such
an institutional context. did doris kearns goodwin lose her job? did
what's his name, that historian man?  forcing troupe to retire simply
reinforces the idea that the pedigree, the papers, are worth more
than what you do...his tragic loss of gainful employment is not where
the tragedies lies...certainly the sense that motivated the lie, the
value of that move - the pressure to represent in such a manner -
seems the real problem. that he lied seems like something that in
another context would have been smoothed over somehow. i like
mairead's hope for him; that seems a good response.

  i must admit to being more than a little shocked at first by seeing
ashbery and troupe on the same stage in damian's post, one evaluated
against the other, but think this might be an interesting thing to
try here.  and i think in an unstated manner that it already goes on
here in any case. when many of us criticize another, or some poet or
some activity, we often do so with a sense of what "ought" to be --
and i don't mean that everyone who does this is doing so with a
puritanical sense of it, or as prescriptive authoritarians, though it
makes sense also that it would be read that way, especially here in
this space which requires more eyes for ears.

i've been reading and listening to recordings of george oppen. the
rocks outlived the classicists, the rocks and the lobstermen's
huts,""etc.etc.

(digress, if you can guess)

for my time (which is the cost of participation here, i suppose) some
of the most valuable interventions on the list have been motivated by
a sense of poetic value, perhaps a subset of values generally, and
i'm interested in warrants and the sense of hegemania that pervades
discourse in most places, not to mention on this list. i'm not for
it, and only when the bad guys need to be beaten down at 10:52, it is
sometimes very cathartic.  one doesn't have to be booed off the stage
to imagine how it feels, and i'm sure to many in the "majority" our
projects here amount to a kind of "outsider art" - if by that it's
possible to indicate the most extreme form of marginalization
possible.  for that reason, i thought that rathman's reviews of a
couple seasons ago seemed like they were just getting to the place
where their critical mass was an articulation of at least one clearly
stated belief system, a notation of thought inscribed in time. and i
say clearly stated, but mean i guess opaque in the sense of pop and
fizz that must be the case - meaning that it's not simple and
requires elaboration over time - something difficult to sustain -
that ron is doing that on his blog seems an adequate gesture: i'll
take that over self-induced silence anytime (thinking of the
white-space-cash-currency of oppen's silence, a sort of st. george on
every poetry bill, underneath which is written "i prefer not" and "it
just took me twenty five years to write the next poem") or, thinking
of something about a poetics of statement, and wonder for whom and
for what such catharsis or, say, what the value of witness is
(thinking about how someone like ammiel alcalay or susan howe
complicate the meaning  of that word) -- even then, thinking of say a
poetics - journalism - and simultaneous flashbulbs, photographing
ikea chic with  necessary wisdom of a late twentysomething, the
so-called 'generation x'

(pardon the digression)

and appreciate greatly editorial statements of all sorts- thinking of
juliana's response to ron on his blog that articulation and argument
aren't the same thing.  i think many of us developed an aversion to
"editorial statements" at a time when there was a glut on editorial
statements (hard to believe but then i'm  "in a different place" -
duh - and have been isolated from "what's happening" whatever that is
-- i'm just guessing something is happening)  only there is a
quarrelsome sense which obscures the natures and centers of what's
happening -

(send me a note: what is happening?)

so a post that there is a meeting about "political poetry" is posed
as a reading, but really this is a meeting. i hope we will get a
report, or i hope that we don't wait to have that meeting here. it
seems tragic that this list gets used as a forum and that the mania
which pervades doesn't allow for a sustained exploration. why is
that?  what would it take to develop something over a period of
months or years?  ammiel alcalay and anne waldman plan to have some
kind of meeting. it sounds terrific and perhaps there is some value
to getting together in a small isolated group to discuss something in
a room. what would be discussed? i hope to know more about this and
encourage them to have such a conversation here.

the reports on this list pale in comparison to the announcements.
does this mean that the gatherings aren't valuable? that nothing
interesting or useful is discussed? doubt it. most likely people are
invested in a local community and have little for what this forum
could present (those people who live in areas without many gatherings
of the sort advertised here probably understand this better than
any). And that's cool, frankly. but it is a symptom. symptomatic,
synecdochic


imagine the tone of the pissing contest in the context of an
international forum to discuss our ideas about what to do. such a
pissy fight wouldn't last ten seconds. i think only the people on the
list can change the tone of the list. this public sphere seems a
requisite testing ground for some of the behaviors that would be
required to really do anything about what is happening "out there" in
the political world. on that count, i think there is something that
can be really done to stop the war in iraq and i actually believe
that it can and will be stopped. but my will and hope won't work on
their own.  i've actually had good luck, hearing back from committee
staffers. if you write a good letter, i'm convinced that someone will
read it. getting a letter back may seem like small consequence. i've
been spamming the cnn site with letters the profile of which would
look something like "lefty connie chung fan" -- and ends with stuff
like "just a vote to let you know that we're out here" -- black elvis
on the headphones

anyhow, i'm shopping around for lists that offer alternative modes of
dealing with response. perhaps blogging?  certainly this is the kind
of thing (here, this post) best saved for the blog-space.  but in
replace of what?  in addition, writing poems and reading them to
small cultic groups seems hardly a response. but a great time, don't
get me wrong - i miss such gatherings and think that if nothing else
they provide some kind of company, which again is no small thing.
bickering here likewise seems a drain on the spirt and the energy.
think of the energy expended - will it simply be deleted? imbued
value seems compelling in and of itself.

to return to the quincy troupe thing:
i really like "poem for magic" (which has been at the factory school
website since its founding) -- but i'm not sure why...it's
complicated...something saved for the lecture hall...but suffice to
say i'm worried that the "rhyme" as its conceived here is at quite a
remove from how rhyme might be functioning in his poetry. in this
respect, ashbery might look totally different (and no better frankly)
on different terms and conditions - . one of the first things we
encounter is this vertical hierarchy of values, serving as tradition
or lineage...i'm curious to know how people receive these things, one
of the reasons i enjoyed reading rathman's posts - like many of the
posts on this list, in fact

there is something very useful about "poem for magic"  -- it seems as
formally interesting to me as anything going on in so called
experimental poetry
(http://www.factoryschool.org/content/sounds/poetry/troupe/troupe1.ram)

given the status of contemporary poetry, its relation to its own
condition of production and distribution and reception, it seems that
a poem for magic is pretty relevant. a poem about the shake-n-bake
moves of a basketball player seems oddly no less distant, no less
"formal" (i hesitate to say "empty" but i guess that's what i mean,
though a more extended read of this poem is certainly warrented- it
is no less at a remove from something that might be called "political
poetry"

recent spd catalog announces "culture" - poetry book of late daniel
davidson, his work was a move to extend the activist potential of the
work, or the activity of work as an investment in social change

of course this isn't the language of the catalog, but i've not got
the catalog with me, though i think of dan, his work, and hope
perhaps we can start with him, since he actually was "getting
somewhere" as are many others (who are they? i think there are people
out there people believe in -- and perhaps starting with this sense
of that which we know to be good and useful, rather than constantly
nitpicking and fighting over morsels of breath -- and i'm sorry to be
so cheezy about it, but having wanted to go to the buffalo reading,
and alas being unable to do so for multiple reasons, not the least of
which is the weather, and actively seeking a new way of thinking,
paths towards solution, please...

Thanks, Pierre, for the reminder. Once upon a time I was in talks with
Little Richard's manager about a blurb. But that's another story. . . .


        The Little Richard Story


                  The god of Abraham is a true God.  Now
                we gonna do "Rip It Up."

        Nothing is talking to you
        in the numbers, in the leaves.
        No mambo mambo on the wind.
        No colored streamers in the skies.
        No one has pasted little notes
        to you, like kisses.
        No Fred, no Ginger,
        no sudden bursting
        into Stone Age languages.
        No angels clustered in the rafters.
        No giants sacked out on the stove.

        On a day like this,
        without the music
        of appearances, creatures
        could land and you
        would not be able to explain
        anything to them, not
        the fearless industry
        of beavers, or why dust bunnies
        prefer the dark, not even
        how Little Richard
        himself came into being.

someone probably mentioned this already, but one terrific Mal Waldron album
is "The Quest" (which includes the beautiful "Warm Canto")--Waldron is the
leader and Dolphy is one of the side-men.  Predictably, the album was later
"re-issued" as an Eric Dolphy album (I forget its name).  This isn't, of
course, meant as a slam of Dolphy . . .

Subject:      Massoud the Afghan
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Just saw Christophe de Ponfilly's "Massoud the Afghan" at Film Forum. I
don't know how much distribution it has, but it's here in New York for
anyone who wants to see it, and no doubt elsewhere. It's centered around
Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Northern Alliance leader who was assassinated on
9/9/01. The footage goes back to the 80s, from earlier of Ponfilly's
projects. It's an amazing documentary.

In one scene, halfway through the film, Massoud reads the paper, in which
there's a poem, which he reads aloud & then explicates to some degree for
everyone in the room. Asked if he "reads a lot" by the filmmaker, Massoud
replies, "I read, whenever I have time, poems."

I thought that was interesting, "poems" and not "poetry." Couldn't tell
really, because it's of course in translation. But that he seemed to be
indicating "instances" as opposed to "body of work" or "tradition," assuming
the translation was accurate. But also, that poems were there, in the paper,
and people reading them, and that in the midst of (at the time) a
19-year-old war, still of value.

The film is also useful as a kind of political history lesson of
Afghanistan, including of course both Pakistani and American interests in
the region (oil pipelines). It's a shame this isn't on TV. A pressure group
to get it on TV where it would be seen by other than NYC liberals (like me)
paying for the experience would be nice. Maybe a project for enthusiasts
who've been getting somewhere with letter-writing campaigns?

(Digression ...)

Daniel Davidson's name has come up a couple of times here, once by someone
who thought his work was too hermetic, once by someone who thought he was
"getting somewhere." I'm not sure what to think about either response--he
did kill himself, after all, and leave his friends with that. Not sure
people realize the kind of guilt one's suicided friends carry around. And I
don't mean that glibly. Like, you feel, for much of your life following
that, that you were responsible, for "allowing" him to do that.  Because you
weren't able to stop it. Change the trajectory.

My sense reading both posts about him was that neither reader had really
read what he was writing terribly closely, or maybe that it wasn't really
considered in some larger sense ... or something. I don't think he was
hermetic; but at the same time, if he was getting somewhere, where was it?

Suicide?

As Benjamin Friedlander clearly stated in the blurb that one poster seemed
to have conveniently not remembered, this really was the end-result of his
"project." It's an end that I think Ben, and myself, and probably anyone who
doesn't believe in Heaven, is going to find untenable. To say the least.

One wants political models whose "way out" is not, necessarily,
self-obliteration.

If at all possible.

Not to deride Dan's project. At all. Because it was anything but "hermetic."
But to understand where it--actually--led him. That ought to be taken into
account. And some attempt made to understand why.

End of digression. See the movie. It's great. And, I think, potentially
generative,

Gary

Just out from Wesleyan UP:

LAVISH ABSENCE: RECALLING AND REREADING EDMOND JABES
by Rosmarie Waldrop.
Foreword by Richard Stamelman

An intimate portrait of one of France's most important writers by his
translator.
Edmond Jabes (1912-1991) is widely regarded as one of France's most
important writers of the 20th century. Born in Cairo, he settled in
France after begin expelled from Egypt with other Jews during the
1856 Suez Crisis. Rosmarie Waldrop is Jabes's primary English
translator. Over the course of her long association and friendship
with Jabes, Waldrop developed a very nuanced understanding of his
work that in turn influenced her development as both writer and
translator. LAVISH ABSENCE is a book-length essay with a triple
focus: it is a memoir of Jabes as Waldrop knew him, it is both an
homage to and an explication of Jabes's work, and it is a meditation
on the process of translation. The  writing interweaves these topics,
evoking Jabes's interest in the themes of exile and nomadism.

        "LAVISH ABSENCE is a comprehensive yet intimate introduction
to the writing and thought of Edmond Jabes, a critical figure for
20th-century poetry and philosophy. It is also a welcome articulation
of Rosmarie Waldrop's own poetics."-Charles Bernstein

Actually it was Ashbery and Daniel Hoffman, just to
clarify. "Troupe" merely lingered in the subject line.
Given the transposition, I can see why Joel would be "a
little shocked" -- I don't think I'd even know on what
grounds to begin a comparison between Troupe and Ashbery,
unless by a kind of six-degrees-of-Amiri-Baraka maneuver.

Thanks to Andrew Epstein for reminding me that it's
Ashbery's "Illustration" (from Some Trees) I was thinking
of --

A novice was sitting on a cornice
High over the city. Angels

Combined their prayers with those
Of the police, begging her to come off it ...

Comparing this with Hoffman's "Center of Attention" would
work great in the classroom -- many points of consonance
and dissonance ("But how could we tell / That of the truth
we know, she was // The somber vestment?" roughly
corresponding to the rhymed stanza from Hoffman). This
ain't my blog, however, so I won't pursue this as a
thread-unto-myself.

Best,
Damian

The Buffalo Anti-War reading made for an enjoyable evening. It was not the
soap box stomping I feared it might turn into. There was a strong possiblity
of a 60's activist reading of bongo beating and flag burning singing
alternating rounds of give peace a chance. Thankfully there was no
radicalism outside of the nature of the poetry presented. The main political
message might have been complete disbelief a rational civilizilised society
would engage in such a thing as war when we have learned all of our lives
that this is haphazzard and wrong. This was nice as the focus was on poetry
that included current politics not current politics with line breaks.

It was a packed house in Rust Belt books (and if you are not fimiliar with
the store it is Buffalo's best used book shop!) and the event was divided
into two sections, a reading then a discussion. I could only stay for the
reading so I'll talk on that and maybe someone else can fill in on the
discussion.

Our generation does embrace this idea of political poetry while remaining
true to the ideals of poetry. Jonathan Skinner read a rant against Formal
Poetry. These possibly being his articles of war :-) Irony in the form of
humor was brought up in the form of found texts and cut-ups. People read the
greats like Borgies and Beckett (that was spliced with newspaper quotes).
One poet read a beautiful poem written especially for the event and her use
of language was of the school of buffalo sound but cleverly escaped that
Language : The Next Generation humdrum. Other poets used correspondence and
personal notes to bring a personal intamacy of real people and their
responses. Another reading off, in a machine gun style, a long list of book
titles that start with 'War'. One poet blithely used biblical blather to
demonize the US as the whore of Babylon.

All in all it was a great night of poetry and cold weather.

the fact that dan davidson had a project at all is something i was
hoping we could talk about. personally, i have only limited access to
what that project was. that it ended in suicide is tragic and i
suppose that should keep us from talking about it, in order that we
learn the lesson correctly. it may be said that suicide was in some
sense where that project got him, but i think that's  unfair,
certainly to dan and certainly to those wish to understand what that
project was. and i was just hoping to start with him, because he had
a project. perhaps having a project is over-rated. it also seems
unfair to cast a cloud over the project when some people already feel
the work is "hermetic" -- and i'm thinking only somewhat of the work
itself, or rather, would like to expand the concept of what his work
was. for example, the iraqi pins, which seem of limited value in the
end, are a place to start that conversation. obviously there are
other places to start. i got the spd catalog and saw that blurb
before giving the catalog to a hungry undergrad who knows nothing of
this material at all.  anyhow, fine, if you want to talk about
someone else, great. i'm sorry if i offended. no wonder so few people
post. i have a horrible feeling in my stomach--would rather have
these conversations in person, alas. and i'm happy to be an advocate
for "poems" or "poetry" (whatever), but it's hard to be an advocate
for this space. i'm reachable backchannel but will return to
digest/no mail mode.  have fun!

Actually, I looked up the English Dept. faculty on the web but didn't
know anyone.  But I expect that some people on this list have links with
Grambling.  Degrees are the currency colleges and universities traffic
in.  To me, awarding an honorary degree appropriately skirts the moral
issues which people have been discussing here; it doesn't actually
change anything or even mean anything.   But it is a donorship of
something which for many can only be bought in sweat or, as in the
University of Arizona College of Nursing murders, blood.

Stephen Cope and I are presently considering proposals that address some
aspect and/or aspects of New York Poetry in the 1960s and 1970s (i.e.,
so-called Second Generation New York School, Umbra, Fluxus).  For those
of you that are interested in submitting a proposal, please take a look
at the official call for papers at

http://www.uea.ac.uk/eas/People/kane/DON'T_EVER_GET_FAMOUS_CFP.htm.

If you wish to correspond with us regarding the project, please make
sure to email both of us at the same time.

We can; I never meant to shut that off. My turn to aplogize if I've
offended. I just thought it was interesting that the two posts about him
were polarized, each at one end of a spectrum. I just think the reality was
more complicated than that.

www.krupskayabooks.com along with an afterword I wrote that maybe
contextualizes the work a little--there's some, not a lot, but some
discussion of his various procedures for poems, for instance. Plus some
other anecdotal stuff about him. There are also a number of essays, poems,
and letters having to do with Dan in the first issue of Readme, at
http://home.jps.net/~nada . You do have access to a great portion of his
project! Free access! Anyway, definitely check it out.

>that it ended in suicide is tragic and i suppose that should keep us
>from talking about it, in order that we learn the lesson correctly.

That's not what I was saying, that we shouldn't talk about it. I was saying
we should look at it, think about it, and then talk about it. I don't think
it's wrong to suggest someone read something before talking about it.

>it may be said that suicide was in some sense where that project got
>him, but i think that's unfair, certainly to dan and certainly to those
>wish to understand what that project was.

I don't think it's unfair. Reading his work (which is what you should do if
you want to understand it), you'll see that while I don't think suicide is
mentioned outright, it runs through the project, that "point of view," let's
say. It can't, I was trying to say, be separated from the work, that act.
Granted, I was very close to him, so "that act" had for me very palpable
resonance. But it is in the work, I'd known that before he committed
suicide. Actually, my very first correspondence with him, in the early
eighties, was a letter I got from him in response to one I'd sent him, which
began: "I was just about to kill myself, when your letter arrived." It was a
joke, in the context of the letter. But it was not a joke in the context of
his life. He'd been planning it, or at least considering it, for a very long
time. That may or may not be self-evident in the work; I'd love to talk
about how others feel when they read it. For me, it is self-evident. But
others' experiences might suggest otherwise.

>and i was just hoping to start with him, because he had a project.
>perhaps having a project is over-rated. it also seems unfair to cast a
>cloud over the project when some people already feel the work is
>"hermetic"

I think if Dan had just one day up and decided to kill himself, it might be
unfair to "cast a cloud over his project." But, again--and I don't mean to
be mean or anything, you should really read the work. You'll see, no one
needs to cast a cloud over the project. The cloud is already there. He used
to call himself "Mr. Doom and Gloom." He *liked* there being clouds
overhimself, his work, he cultivated it. He wore nothing but black nearly
every day of his life, and not necessarily because it was trendy. I don't
think it nullifies his work, though, and I'm saddened that that's all you
got from what I said. I apologise for that.

>anyhow, fine, if you want to talk about someone else, great. i'm sorry if i
>offended. no wonder so few people post. i have a
>horrible feeling in my stomach--would rather have these conversations
>in person, alas. and i'm happy to be an advocate for "poems" or
>"poetry" (whatever), but it's hard to be an advocate for this space.
>i'm reachable backchannel but will return to digest/no mail mode. have fun!

Again, I wasn't trying to shut off discussion of his work, but to complicate
the discussion. And nudge people to read some of it so they could talk about
it having done that, with that perspective. Anyway, I'm sending this to you
backchannel as well as front, hoping you won't just disappear. I know it's
difficult to talk here. But it can be done. Surely you believe that, having
edited a book of dialog from this space. Or, maybe you don't. But, maybe,
try?

Anyway. Let us know what you think of the work on Krupskaya's site, and how
people have talked/written about him in Readme. Sorry for hurting your
tummy. That really wasn't intended.

Geoffrey, where did you find this description?!! I was 'there' at many
anti-war readings, marches, events and your collage sounds more inventive
than true. But maybe there was such an event. Otherwise I don't know what
your dismissive description serves or fears. (??)

It sounds like the reading last night was a good and gratifying one.
However,  I don't understand the under or overtone of your post  that seems
to be put out a requirement that an anti-war poetry reading be tied to some
strict bounds of sophistication and decorum, including its audience,
contributors and context. Certain kinds of language are OK and certain
things are not. (Alright, I don't like to sit through somebody who is all
heart or all attitude and no skill) But  isn't there an assumption here that
one kind of output is more effective, more accurately anti-war than another?
Perhaps. But it makes me uncomfortable. My sense is that upcoming works and
events against the war will be composed of a variety of gestures (visual,
musical, linguistic), high and 'low' culture, each one speaking from
different cultural, class, and ethnic perspectives. I suspect (ideally) the
aggregate of a portion of all these contributions will begin to construct an
effective anti-war, anti-Bush, etc. culture.  Whether historians, literary
and otherwise - thirty years from now - look back and say "what great art"
(as say one does at the anti-war poems of WWI English poets), or amalgamates
and dismisses these gestures (as in your quote) remains to be seen. It could
be all effective and aesthetically not interesting - as much Anti-Vietnam
War poetry often seemed to me at the time or, at least, sincerity
non-withstanding, very hard to write. In fact the writing about that War
after the fact by both Vietnamese and Americans who were actually in the war
is much more vital and lasting. Collectively speaking for this country, the
Mia Lin's (Sp) Washington Memorial is probably the greatest anti-war poem
(quo sculpture) that we have of any war - but again that - even tho strongly
opposed by Reagan and the Right - was after the fact.
But I remain uncomfortable by what seems your sense of aesthetic stricture
and what that may be about.

great post, stephen v. i'm finding several instances of what i would
term mischaracterizations of past critical approaches in order to
repudiate them in the name of some kind of linear "progress" --it
tends to end up reifying some overly simplistic notion of how things
were done in the past (crudely, unsophisticatedly) in order to
valorize some present development as better informed, more nuanced,
etc.  this was true for example of henry louis gates's jr's early
work on Black Arts era African American literary criticism,which he
portrayed as crude and essentialistic, a misreading in my book, in
order to launch his own agenda.  he stopped doing that and became
more conciliatory after he had become well established.  i see the
same thing in feminist lit crit, and here it is again in antiwar lit
crit, or reviews of antiwar literary events.  geoffrey, i love you
dahhling, but sv has a point.

I remember reading Laura Moriarty's book "Symmetry"
and thinking it a strongly anti-war book (came out
after the Gulf War 1991) in fabulous and interesting
ways.

Has anyone read that book?--I haven't in about two
years, but perhaps will go back to it now

Also pieces in "Poasis," "Europe of Trusts," and of
course the best war/anti-war book I ever read "Memory
for Forgetfulness: August, Beirut, 1982" by Mahmoud
Darwish--what a freaking book!

Dear Stephen and all,

You may be interested in what Maya Lin wrote about the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Boundaries, a book which emphasizes the creative role of
writing in her work, and which also is a celebration of hybridity (in
her case, art and architecture):

"The memorial is analogous to a book in many ways.  Note that on the
right-hand panels the pages are set ragged right and on the left they
are set ragged left, creating a spine at the apex as in a book.  Another
issue was scale; the text type is the smallest that we had come across,
less than half an inch, which is unheard of in monument type sizing.
What it does is create a very intimate reading in a very public space,
the difference in intimacy between reading a billboard and reading a
book.

The only other issue was the polished black granite and how it should be
detailed, over which I remember having a few arguments with the
architects of record.  The architects could not understand my choice of
a reflective, highly polished black granite.  One of them felt I was
making a mistake and the polished surface would be "too *feminine*"
Also puzzling to them was my choice of detailing the monument as a thin
veneer with barely any thickness at its top edge.  They wanted to make
the monument's walls read as a massive, thick stone wall, which was not
my intention at all.  I always saw the wall as pure surface, an
interface bewteen light and dark, where I cut the earth and polished its
open edge.  The wall dematerializes as a form and allows the names to
become the object, a pure and reflective surface that would allow
visitors the chance to see themselves with the names.  I do not think I
thought of the color black as a color, more as the idea of a dark mirror
into a shadowed mirrored image of the space, a space we cannot enter and
from which the names separate us, an interface between the world of the
living and the world of the dead.

One aspect that made the project unusual was its politicized building
process.  For instance, the granite could not come from Canada or
Sweden.  Though those countries had beautiful black granites, draft
evaders went to both countries, so the veterans felt that we could not
consider their granites as options.  (The stone finally selected came
from India).  The actual building process went smoothly for the most
part, and the memorial was built very close to my original intentions.

As far as all of the controversy, I really never wanted to go into it
too much.  The memorial's starkness, it's being below grade, being
black, and how much my age, gender, and race played a part in the
controversy, we'll never quite know.  I think it is actually a miracle
that the piece ever got built.  From the beginning I often wondered, if
it had not been an anonymous entry 1026 but rather an entry by Maya Lin,
would I have been selected?

from Boundaries (Simon & Schuster 2000), 4:15-16.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Same discount as a week ago; some revised early praise...











Dear Poetics List-ers:

A remarkable, provocative new book -- Arakawa and Madeline Gins'
Architectural Body.

EARLY PRAISE FOR Architectural Body

"I have nothing to lose by going along with you. Should you turn out to
be right about reversible destiny, that will be great for me, and if you
are not, then I will suffer no worse a fate than would have befallen me
otherwise." -Arthur Danto, philosopher and author of The Madonna of the
Future: Essays in a Pluralistic Art World, Columbia University.

"Gins and Arakawa know that organism and environment are not two but
one single interaction process open to unfathomed possibilities of
novelty on both sides."--Eugene Gendlin, philosopher and psychotherapist, founder of The
Focusing Institute

"This book--I am completely knocked out by it."-Aaron Kunin, poet and
novelist, Johns Hopkins University.

"Together with Norberg-Schulz's Intentions in Architecture and Venturi's
Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, this work should be
counted among the handful of seminal and iconoclastic contemporary
studies that open up and redefine the field of architecture."-Andrew
MacNair, architect, Columbia University.

"A poetic-philosophical masterpiece. A moral, anti-metaphysical
illumination. Gins and Arakawa have extended Spinoza's insight that the
body has no limits to emerge with a maximal architecture, an
architecture in the visionary mode of Hejduk, Taut, and Schwitters.
Their radical housing project is a severe polemic against the elegiac
Western tradition and its memorials. In an anti-Virgilian mode in which
everything immortal touches the mind, they propose exigent structures
against death."-David Shapiro, art historian, poet, and author of
Lateness, Cooper Union.

"From Plato to Heidegger, from an architectonics of the cosmic demiurge
to a post-metaphysical analysis of building, dwelling, and thinking,
architecture has been conceived as housing for those who die. Arakawa
and Gins ask the question, why not construct for those who will continue
to live? This is the manifesto of a transhuman architecture, a call for
a daring, practical, fully embodied art of living."-Gary Shapiro,
philosopher and author of Archaeologies of Vision: Foucault and
Nietzsche on Seeing and Saying, University of Richmond.

"The first 21st century reconception of human life . . . [and] a program
of expanding human potential on a scale not seen since the
Enlightenment."-Stanley Shostak, biologist and author of Becoming
Immortal, University of Pittsburgh.

"The world may not be precisely ready for this, but these propitious
blueprints are absolutely necessary."-Lissa Wolsak, poet, metal smith,
and author of Pen Chants.


Announcing the latest volume in the series Modern and Contemporary
Poetics, edited by Charles Bernstein and Hank Lazer

Architectural Body

Madeline Gins and Arakawa

The authors urge critical theorists of all stripes to consider taking
nothing less than the architectural body (body-proper plus architectural
surround) as the basic unit for study.

This revolutionary work by artist-architects Arakawa and Madeline Gins
demonstrates the inter-connectedness of innovative architectural design,
the poetic process, and philosophical inquiry. Together, they have
created an experimental and widely admired body of work--museum
installations, landscape and park commissions, home and office designs,
avant-garde films, poetry collections--that challenges traditional
notions about the built environment.

In 1997 the Guggenheim Museum presented an Arakawa/Gins retrospective
and published a comprehensive volume of their work titled Reversible
Destiny: We Have Decided Not to Die. Architectural Body continues the
philosophical definition of that project and demands a fundamental
rethinking of the terms "human" and "being." When organisms assume full
responsibility for inventing themselves, where they live and how they
live will merge. The artists believe that a thorough re-visioning of
architecture will redefine life and its limitations and render death
passé. The authors explain that "Another way to read reversible destiny
. . . is as an open challenge to our species to reinvent itself and to
desist from foreclosing on any possibility."

"This is a strong and important work, as much for its polemic and
contentious claims as for its utopian inflections."
--Steve McCaffery, poet and Director of the North American Centre for
Interdisciplinary Poetics

Arakawa is an architect and artist, and Madeline Gins is an architect,
poet, and novelist.

A rather exemplary draft of hot air - delectable up here in the north =
woods - from Jolly Jull-ick, provocateur and mistaken identitor.

Kristen Gallagher and Tim Shaner deserve a lot of credit for organizing =
last night's event as an open reading, sans "mic," so as to get some =
ideas on the table (presuming the only entry fee is a belief that poetry =
produces ideas) toward isolating a / some true question/s that we, in =
attendance, feel are important as citizens of this nation.  No small =
hope but hope nonetheless.  However, it hardly seems or seemed an "epic" =
endeavor.  Last night you had not only those listed in the pre-event =
program but those who in no way identify as "poets" - i.e., just folks =
eager to read, listen, etc.  Buffalo poets, in, around, and outside the =
university's "poetics program," are self-conscious enough to realize, =
from what I can tell, when they are and are not merely navel-gazing.  =
So, really, take your absentee ballot and shove it up your copy of The =
Cantos.

[The preceding rant is payback for a certain public slogging endured by =
myself based on a case of mistaken-identity by, if I'm not mistaken, =
kid-dynamite JJ.  Am I spiteful?  Careful what you ask for.]

Thank you, Mairead. I have never gotten Maya Lin's book and appreciate the
extensive quote. In addition to her whole research into the historic
architecture of mausoleums - it is interesting (to me) as she describes it
to look at the v-shape of the monument as an open book shape on edge,
simultaneously creating the impression of emerging and descending into the
earth and compelling the option to read work indeed as a "book of the dead."
   But its also a sculptural work that emerged in context (tho somewhat
later) with the major land art and minimalist driven works of Walter De
Maria,  Robert Smithson and Heizer - where the focus on the intrinsic
material (as different from a rhetorical signature or shape) is key.
   From the point of view of text - though this may be off the mark - I
wonder if Lin was aware of the works of concrete poets, at least the work
that focuses on liberating the word by minimizing its syntactical
attachments - similar as it is to the singularity of her use of the names
that can only be fully brought to life by the eye(s) and historical
knowledge(s) of the beholder(s).

Joel, Gary, Harry, et al...

It is good to see a new level of candor break open this space. As for =
the efforts of Troupe, regardless of the ethics of his overt lying or =
omission, it is a tremendous loss to the students at SD and =
poets/artists in SoCal who were affiliated with and assisted by Troupe's =
generosity. At an event over the summer, Pat Payne, a poet and =
performance artist from LA paid homage to Quincy. If memory serves- he =
allowed her to attend his classes for free and then encouraged her to =
apply to the program - which she did. And he's taken care to encourage =
her and nurture her career. Mentors in any capacity, regardless of their =
pedigreed walls, affect powerful changes upon people they are engaged =
with. For this reason alone, whatever you think of the foibles of his =
tongue or the merits of his work, we are all at a loss. And does this =
really have anything at all to do with some mysterious personage, some =
*archetypal* man at the crossroads who so stoically turned down a job =
offer at UCB? I don't think so- other than to stream us rather further =
away from the business of life, like, paying the rent, mentoring =
students whose merits we see (even if no one else seems to...) and =
getting on with it all, *pretty* companions or not, (whatever *pretty* =
is)...there is business to attend to and Quincy seemed like one of those =
rare people who knew exactly the level of privilege he had attained and =
was conscious to keep in touch with and assist others who did not have =
the same.

Which brings me to Ammiel. If there is to be any movement on the front =
of actively opposing the war in iraq it may not come from what we can =
*do* in this space, but through the use of this space for communication, =
collaboration and support, not sniping. Which points a line to Juliana, =
whose recent post on Ron's blog speaks not just to a need for =
articulation and argument but also a need for communities within poetix =
to be in discussion with each other instead of at each other or in =
silent ignorance of each other. And it seems that all of these things =
are connected. Speaking with Ammiel recently, he mentioned that it has =
been very interesting to see who has responded to the call for =
action/discussion/whatever (as I understand it, the thrust of this =
initiative has yet to be defined as he and Anne hope that it will =
achieve self definition through the input of participants) and who has =
not responded. (your name here)=20

And since the calculus of this is expansive: to Dan's suicide- suicide =
goes on. It continues in us because we carry it. Ultimately, it comes =
down to a decision between the head and the hand. If action was =
necessary, how can we really judge, not having lived in that =
neighborhood? Dan's work is extant, we may perhaps assimilate the lesson =
of his work and death *correctly* tho i'm dubious that this is ever =
possible- when friends stop their lives without consulting all of *us* =
(not as a friend of Dan, but as a carrier of the suicidal legacies of =
too many friends) it wounds us, and i don't know if we ever really =
recover. But, we do persist.=20
and that's what i wish people would do. Persist in the articulation of =
these arguments instead of lapsing into something more like throwing a =
dart into a tornado- and turning around to not see where it sticks.


and as for pissing contests, i just always get my ankles wet. maybe if i =
got a prettier wife...

I agree. The Vietnam Memorial is the greatest anti-war work, perhaps in the
West. Yesterday I heard Alice Notley's great, impassioned document around The
Iliad ("It;s a sick book," Alice Notley) and post modern war war. Brilliant,
inspiring piece, another great anti-war document. "The Iliad," the great poem
(written by a man where women deseve no "fate)  made of a catalogue of
itemizede killings. The Viet Nam Memorial, a catalogue/list of mourning of
those dead.

Hi Maria,

Thanks for the love and I agree that SV has a point. However, when reading
vietnam war poems today it is hard to judge bad poetry from just excitement
in the moment poetry. I was a marine in the Gulf War and my mere presence at
this reading was a radical action. I have seen death by big machines and
more blood and black skies to rival Wilfred Owen -- but this is not part of
my poetry. This leads to fetishistic fascinations with blood and death which
is not welcome or relevant. When looking at Ginsberg's political ravings and
bongo playing and circle dancing and flag burning (these event happened -- I
saw it on the Discovery Channel and on the NBC special "The Sixities") I
don't know what to make of it. There was an excitement in bringing down baby
killers and LBJ that Dubya and Co. just doesn't produce. This was evident in
all of the poets reading. But this may come from students taught by Creeley,
whose Vietnam war poems are beautiful and stike the moment with the proper
words.


Best, Geoffrey

Subject:      poem in the political manner
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

I was reading Rousseau's The Social Contract (funny, I got a phone call,
told my friend what I was reading, and he said "Whyyy are you reading
that?") this past weekend...and it was sort of painful...I guess it's the
same reason I'll sometimes listen to ridiculous ultra-right talk radio: to
get out of my thinking or see the thinking of those with whom I'd most
likely never agree. Anyway, I pulled out a phrase which struck me, "If I
were to consider only force & the effects of force..." Okay, I thought, and
what if "I" were to consider those two things. So that coupled with the
phrase, "narrate my bewilderment", which Peter Gizzi used during a recent
Q&A at a reading in Connecticut, jump started this poem. The reason I'm
posting it is really that, well, I do consider it to be a political poem.

I wonder about accusations against younger poets (of which I am one) of not
being politically engaged, wonder as far as definition of terms...

what does one mean by political poetry?

Is it using non-normative syntax as a means through which to demonstrate
one's abhorrence for the power structure, as that structure was built on/out
of the very same language? if this is so would content matter?

Is it a call to action, prompting others to then leave the poem w/ a new,
utopian sense of purpose?

Is it somewhere between?

What does an anti-war poem look like?

_____________________________________
anyway, here's mine:


conditional slogan


If I were to consider only force & the effects
     of force, if I were to narrate my bewilderment
with a nation's dove coo, to sing

a recovery, the speech of broken tools,
     if I were a garden over the ash heap, ballast
under the railroad bed, if I bent

along a river bank, goldenrod & red baneberry,
     a field guide for the weight of musket balls,
aftermath in a chalked outline, silhouettes

against the damp walls, if I were to cluster
     the impossible annotations, the perhaps
of hair woven by candlelight, a tenement

courtyard, upkeep of the hedge maze,
     if I were a paddock, had silver filigree,
a nook in which to lock away the loom,

if I peddled snake oil, holstered a marked deck,
     were to embrace such a doctrine, to obey
the weather, vertical wind shear

in the Western Pacific, if I were a poem
     the size of a postcard, freight of Flemish wheat,
if I were to find a world, a word, to invent one,

to wear an allusion suspect, the earth
     a synonym for self, for you are here
& otherwise, snow on an eyelash, actual

lemons, a living moon, if I were a deer moving
     out of the frame, another scope to insulate
an idea, frightened spelunker of dust,

if I were a nail, the dirt underneath, ashamed
     to repeat the word endure, to translate
a commonwealth, if I were an illustrated history,

had come to debase the coinage, Liberty's
     detached head, who died a beacon to virtue, left us
the taint & flaw of a story, the worth of a stone,

canned sardines & kerosene, if I were sold
     to one who wants a master, to conjugate autonomy,
donning a course cloak, a window's headdress,

other ways to walk a life, if I fixed
     on the sluggish door, on the dawn, hailed
all the ancillary images, how proudly

they falter, how the wind chimes dance
     a violent reliquary, if I feigned belief,
were alive & elsewhere, left the lion

in the same locket as the lamb, if I could
     keep a secret, could say the instruments age
into warmth, could call my first witness reverie.

anti-war
is every poem and you should write and scream it until blood comes out
your mouth has no other use
your eyes have no other use than testament
use them

there is no other reason to be alive than to confront
the fat other of rimbaud sitting in washington
burning flesh i can't write something so stupid as this
but they will come into the night and take us away
keep copies spread them don't wait a single second
this is stupid stupid stupid

anti-war poems are useless
write them until your mouth is full
your mouth is amazing, Marguerite
your mouth is amazing

   to see Mahmoud Darwish as an anti-war poet is to see Homer as one....this
propaganda by proxy let it never rest...the endless glorification of macho
self and political violence by men is what we all needs more of...i couldn't
agree more with Mr Graza post about the quality of verse produced by Creeley
as against Ginsie during the Nam....esp. a certain awful 'better than thou
bro' stance so much anti-war verse wades thigh deep in.......resistance &
heroism are just other words for the murder that your side uses...i'm not
anti-war...but for another take.....try Nelly Sachs O THE CHIMMNEYS ...harry...

In the 1950s, the CIA funded several programs intended to carry the work
of the abstract expressionist painters overseas & even funded a couple
of little magazines. While the couple of books written about 15 years
ago attempted to turn this into a "abstract expressionism was a CIA
plot," a rather loopy leap of logic, it unquestionably helped spread the
word of their painting especially to Europe ("overseas" was a smaller
place in 1950 in the U.S. imagination). This new program sounds like an
exact attempt to do the same thing.

It's good to see Creeley making sense amidst it all,

U.S. Writers Do Cultural Battle Around the Globe
By MICHAEL Z. WISE

NY Times

The Bush administration has recruited prominent American writers to
contribute to a State Department anthology and give readings around the
globe in a campaign started after 9/11 to use culture to further
American diplomatic interests.

The participants include four Pulitzer Prize winners, Michael Chabon,
Robert Olen Butler, David Herbert Donald and Richard Ford; the American
poet laureate, Billy Collins; two Arab-Americans, Naomi Shihab Nye and
Elmaz Abinader; and Robert Pinsky, Charles Johnson, Bharati Mukherjee
and Sven Birkerts. They were all asked to write about what it means to
be an American writer.

Although the State Department plans to distribute the 60-page booklet of
15 essays free at American embassies worldwide in the next few weeks,
one country has already banned the anthology: the United States. The
Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, renewed when the United States Information
Agency became part of the State Department three years ago, bars the
domestic dissemination of official American information aimed at foreign
audiences.

"There were Congressional fears of the government propagandizing the
American people," said George Clack, the State Department editor who
produced the anthology. The essays can, however, be read on a government
Web site intended for foreigners
(usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/writers). "We do not provide that
address to U.S. citizens," Mr. Clack said, adding, "Technology has made
a law obsolete, but the law lives on."

Despite the domestic blackout, the participants are focused on the
potential abroad. "There is the perception abroad that Americans feel
culturally superior and are intellectually indifferent," said Mr. Ford,
who won the Pulitzer in 1996 for his novel "Independence Day." "Those
stereotypes need to be burst." He added that he was eager to go to
Islamic nations to help "humanize America" and present a more diverse
picture of public opinion than is conveyed by the Bush administration.
"With a government like the one we have, when not even 50 percent of
Americans voted for the president, the diversity of opinion is not
represented," he said.

Stuart Holliday, a former White House aide to President Bush who is
overseeing the anthology publication as coordinator of the State
Department's Office of International Information Programs, said: "We're
shining a spotlight on those aspects of our culture that tell the
American story. The volume of material is there. The question is how can
it be augmented to give a clearer picture of who we are."

Before the cold war ended, the United States often sent orchestras,
dance troupes and other artists abroad to infiltrate Communist societies
culturally. Writers like John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut, Edward Albee and E.
L. Doctorow gave government-sponsored readings in Eastern Europe that
used literature on behalf of American interests.

"People lined up for blocks," recalled William H. Luers, a former
American ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later president of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, speaking of Mr. Updike's appearance at the
embassy in Prague in the mid-1980's.

But the United States Information Agency, which ran that campaign, was
folded into the State Department in 1999, and over the last 10 years
such programs have been severely reduced.

Since 9/11, though, the State Department has increased its efforts to
communicate American values to overseas audiences. Mr. Holliday
described the anthology, for example, as complementing efforts by
Charlotte Beers, a former Madison Avenue advertising executive who is
now under secretary of state for public diplomacy, to sell the United
States to often hostile Muslim populations.

Her campaign includes "Next Chapter," a television show broadcast by the
Voice of America in Iran, a worldwide traveling exhibition of
photographs of the ravaged World Trade Center site by Joel Meyerowitz,
the distribution of videos spotlighting tolerance for American Muslims
and a pamphlet showing Muslims as part of mainstream American life.

Christopher Ross, the State Department's special coordinator for public
diplomacy, has advocated reviving official cultural programs abroad as a
"cost-effective investment to ensure U.S. national security" and a way
to combat "the skewed, negative and unrepresentative" image of America
that he says most people of the world absorb through mass culture and
communications. Yet even some of the authors expressed mixed feelings
about just how effective such cultural exposure would ultimately prove.

In an interview, Billy Collins quoted Auden's famous line that "poetry
makes nothing happen," but Mr. Collins tempered that comment by adding:
"I think there are some cases where it can. I don't think a group of
American writers is going to bring peace to the Middle East, but it puts
something in the media that is a counterbalance to the growling and
hostilities that fill the pages. It would have a positive and softening
influence on things." And while Mr. Collins said he has agreed to join a
tour abroad, he added, "It's not a particularly good time for unarmed
American poets to be wandering around Jordan and Syria."

Ms. Abinader was more optimistic about the potential for the literary
initiative to change foreign perceptions. "I don't think I'm going to
grab a terrorist by the lapels and say, `There's a better way of doing
things,' " she said. "But what you can do is inspire a different kind of
power. That's the power of the word."

Some of the anthology's authors, paid $2,499 by the government, praise
the freedoms they enjoy in the United States, but the collection by no
means presents an uncritical picture of the United States. Julia
Alvarez, a novelist and poet who moved from the Dominican Republic when
she was young, writes that America is not "free of problems or
inequalities or even hypocrisies." Robert Olen Butler says that the
United States, though `built on the preservation of the rights of
minorities, has sometimes been slow to apply those rights fully."
Michael Chabon tells of crime and racial unrest in his hometown,
Columbia, Md.

The poet Robert Creeley said that although the Sept. 11 attacks led to
an outpouring of poetry to express sorrow, this "passed quickly as the
country regained its equilibrium, turned to the conduct of an aggressive
war and, one has to recognize, went back to making money."

Ms. Abinader, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants to Pennsylvania,
recalls being subjected to racist remarks by her classmates because of
her dark complexion. Later in her academic career, she says, "feelings
toward Arabs became more negative and sometimes bordered on distrust,
even from my own colleagues."

The other Arab-American in the volume, Naomi Shihab Nye, was asked to
contribute after the State Department took note of an open letter she
wrote "to any would-be terrorists" the week after Sept. 11. "I beg you,
as your distant Arab cousin, as your American neighbor, listen to me,"
she wrote in the letter distributed on the Internet and printed in
several Arabic-language newspapers. "Our hearts are broken, as yours may
also feel broken in some ways we can't understand unless you tell us in
words. Killing people won't tell us. We can't read that message. Find
another way to live. Don't expect others to be like you."

Some 31,000 English-language copies of the new anthology will be
available abroad. Editions in Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian are
also being prepared. Additional translations into two dozen other
languages are expected, with a total of about 100,000 copies likely to
be distributed in the next few years. Mr. Holliday said he hoped that
the essays would also be reprinted in foreign newspapers and that
students abroad would use the texts as course material and to learn
English.

All but one of the articles appear for the first time in the volume; the
essay by Mr. Chabon is a reprint.

Mr. Luers applauded the anthology but urged a more coordinated and
intensive program of cultural diplomacy. "We have to find ways to convey
not just propaganda but the richness of this country's culture," he
said. "It's pathetic that we don't make an effort. Very educated people
abroad don't realize the depths of our culture behind McDonald's and the
violent movies."

let's see if any of the below have the guts to refuse these
government-ratifying blandishments, as did some of the here
afore-criticized anti-war poets of the 1960s: lowell, rich, etc.

Maya Lin's brother is the poet Tan Lin, with whom she has collaborated
on one major piece since the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  In Boundaries,
she describes the influence on her aesthetic of her home environment
growing up.  Her father was a ceramicist and professor of art and every
element of design in the home was consciously informed, as she describes
it.  The Vietnam Veterans who sponsored the contest which Maya Lin won
stipulated that all the names of the missing and killed in action be
used.  That was the essential design problem she worked with, in the
context of the given location in D.C.  Her work after the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial is also heavily informed by words, names, dates: not
just elements of text but very loaded and significant textual detail.
One of the most interesting things about "Boundaries," for me, is the
extent to which she initiates ideas through writing.  In fact, the book
begins with a sentence saying that the creative process starts with
writing.
The statement which accompanied her drawings for the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial was crucial to the submission: in fact, the drawings, which
were extremely minimalist, were supplementary to the statement in a
sense.  Strangely, they supplied the emotional gestalt of the design and
the statement supplied the nitty-gritty, if there can be said to be any
nitty-gritty with Lin (I think there can).  But back to your question
about concrete poetry.  On the ubu site, which is fantastic, Tan Lin is
listed, but not Maya Lin.  I suppose the distinction might be: does an
artist present herself or himself as a poet, or not?  (Or is she or he
dead enough to be re-assigned by someone else).  Given the major
difference that Maya Lin is working in a public arena, and an
artist/poet such as Ian Hamilton Finlay is working in a private context,
I think the major distinction is in self-presentation.  To consider Maya
Lin as a poet, working very significantly in the public arena, is
groundbreakingly refreshing (for poetry).

Thank you, Mairead. I have never gotten Maya Lin's book and appreciate
the
extensive quote. In addition to her whole research into the historic
architecture of mausoleums - it is interesting (to me) as she describes
it
to look at the v-shape of the monument as an open book shape on edge,
simultaneously creating the impression of emerging and descending into
the
earth and compelling the option to read work indeed as a "book of the
dead."
   But its also a sculptural work that emerged in context (tho somewhat
later) with the major land art and minimalist driven works of Walter De
Maria,  Robert Smithson and Heizer - where the focus on the intrinsic
material (as different from a rhetorical signature or shape) is key.
   From the point of view of text - though this may be off the mark - I
wonder if Lin was aware of the works of concrete poets, at least the
work
that focuses on liberating the word by minimizing its syntactical
attachments - similar as it is to the singularity of her use of the
names
that can only be fully brought to life by the eye(s) and historical
knowledge(s) of the beholder(s).
   Does her book say who she was reading?

In the grip of a comfortable stillness.
        After a very hot shower, I step out onto the glass
porch for a smoke.  The sky today looks like pavement,
dirty ice ground to a crisp plummet of wisps spilled
like respiration, like breathing fell over and
dispersed  among the minutes I have before work floods
the space around me with harsh immaculate light and
nowhere to sit down. The glass porch is filthy; we
dump our cigarette butts in plastic bags to be taken
in and fed to the garbage inside. This one, though,
has escaped, and squats contentedly on the floor just
in front of the table between our chairs.
        Description is no more true than poetry might be if
living re-arranged itself according to December's
movement across the inertia of birds forgotten in
migration to complexity.
        I walk somewhere more basic: I walk to work. At lunch
premonitions of the predictable ice storm enthuses
everyone, even those stamped with dread. These tart
accents and translucent shuffles refuse to submit to
our feedings amid links and iterative loops. At the
center of Baby literatures swoon. ~I mean to drown
interactively~ I would tell Baby, if I could find her
in this seamlessness of scene.
        You pick up the snowglobe, forever outside. You shake
it furiously.

Subject:      The limits of confrontation
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Largely as a result of backchannels with Joel and others, I've been
fortunately forced to clarify my sense of what it is about Dan's project
that I see, despite all of the other, very generative aspects of it, as
limited, and of perhaps less--and, I would argue, potentially
destructive--value.

I see a direct relationship between  what Dan was doing, in his work (and
life) with d.a.levy ... who I have always admired, but also see as having
possibly come to an end, a too-early end, as some at least partial result of
having lived and written so fully confrontationally. So, not that the work
leads one to suicide, but that they all do seem of a piece, coming out of a
similar point of view or position or proposition.

Dan had thought about suicide for so many years, even before he became
physically ill (it was an occasional topic of conversation we had), that I
think he was aware of suicide as being, in addition to a way out of pain
(emotional as well as physical), also a deeply confrontational act. As I
wrote to Joel, one thing I was (unsuccessfully) trying to articulate
earlier, was that in doing that, Dan destroyed the community that I'd felt
part of, small as it was. And not just by committing suicide--I watched over
the years as his confrontational nature pushed mutual friends away, one at
time, so that by the end of his life, I don't think there were more than a
couple of people we knew in common who were still talking with him. But, if
this makes sense, this feeling I have that he not only pushed away people
while he was alive, but in how he died. I just feel bad to think about that
kind of thing being repeated.

An example of the limits of confrontation--albeit an anecdotal example--is
what happened after my first, very confrontational post in response to
Joel's. It sent him running. Dan was constantly confrontational with people
on the street, and often--if you can believe it--in "poetic" ways. But I
think, as I watched that, I just saw the same result over and over--it just
seemed to send people running away. Including, unfortunately, many of his
friends, people who otherwise very much were sympatico with his politics
and, to more or less extent, his aesthetic vision.

As I said backchannel to Joel, there really is much generative about his
work, stuff I've learned from, largely the extent to which he seemed to be
pushing borders, getting outside of them, the borders of, let's say, a
"written art." Also, cultural borders--Dan was an anthopology student--and
though this aspect of his interest and study didn't quite permeate his work
in the way it does in, say, Ammiel Alcalay's Cairo Notebooks or From the
Warring Factions (Dan never left the U.S.), it was there to some degree, and
I definitely picked up on that.

It's that aspect that most intrigues me, feels most generative, when I think
about "anti-war" poetry. There's a funny passage in Anne Tardos's new book,
The Dik-dik's Solitude. She's taken these photographs of her and Jackson Mac
Low sitting at a table in front of microphones, and added in cartoon
balloons her own dialog. One one page we get:

ANNE: Ever notice how people dislike didactic pieces?

JACKSON: They should be grateful for the information they receive.

ANNE: Yeah, right.

I thought that was kind of funny, because of course "yeah, right" could
simply be an acknowledgment, but it's also a colloquial way of saying "I
don't think so." So it's this funny tension there between the two. But,
ultimately, I agree with what Anne has Jackson saying up there ... but only
in cases where didactic pieces truly *give* one information. Information on
didn't already have. Which, again, seems maybe a limit in some anti-war
poetry, not all of it, and maybe not the majority of it. But, why I was
hoping, earlier, for "anti-war" poetry that does incorporate something
besides what we already know this culture, this country (its "leaders"), to
be.

Anyway--I've talked too much about this, so I'll shut up now. But I did want
to say that I appreciated talking with Joel a little backchannel, and
getting input from others (I don't know that they necessarily want to be
named, so I'll leave that to them, if it matters), to help clarify my own
thoughts about this.

Thanks.

U.S. Anti - War Activist Berrigan Dies at 79
By REUTERS


Filed at 10:33 a.m. ET

BALTIMORE (Reuters) - Philip Berrigan, a former priest who was at the forefront of the American anti-war movement for the past four
decades, died late Friday, the Baltimore Sun reported. He was 79.

Berrigan, died of liver and kidney cancer at Jonah House, a communal living facility for war resisters in the Baltimore suburb of
Catonsville, the newspaper reported on its Web site on Saturday.

The former Roman Catholic priest who was ordained in 1955, gained national prominence when he led a group of Vietnam War protesters
who become known as the Catonsville Nine, in staging one of the most dramatic protests of the 1960s.

The group, which included his brother Daniel, a Jesuit priest, doused homemade napalm on a small bonfire of draft records in a
Catonsville, Maryland, parking lot and ignited a generation of anti-war dissent. More recently he helped found the Plowshares
movement, whose members have attacked federal military property in anti-war and anti-nuclear protests and were then often
imprisoned.

In a final statement released by his family, he said, ``I die with the conviction, held since 1968 and Catonsville, that nuclear
weapons are the scourge of the earth; to mine for them, manufacture them, deploy them, use them, is a curse against God, the human
family, and the earth itself.''

Berrigan persistently and publicly criticized the Vietnam War and U.S. foreign and domestic policy and his defiant protests led him
to serve some 11 years in jail and prison.

Howard Zinn, professor emeritus at Boston University who maintained a friendship with Berrigan through the years because they had
similar views, called him ``one of the great Americans of our time,'' the Baltimore Sun said. ``He went to prison again and again
and again for his beliefs,'' said Zinn.

Berrigan saw his protests as ``prophetic acts'' based on the Biblical injunction to beat swords into plowshares.

In his most recent clash in December 1999, Berrigan and others banged on A-10 Warthog warplanes in an anti-war protest at an Air
National Guard base. He was convicted of malicious destruction of property and sentenced to 30 months. He was released on Dec. 14
last year.

His first arrest came in the early 1960's during a civil rights protest in Selma, Alabama.

Philip Francis Berrigan was born Oct. 5, 1923, in Two Harbors, Minnesota.

Creeley is on of the contributors to the State Department publication:

http://www.usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/writers/creeley.htm

my impression (from a quick read) was that the licks he did get in were more
co-opted by the context, then succeeding in raising a real banner of sense.
but (to echo gary sullivan in another thread) anything more challenging
praps would have been confrontational to the point of self-defeating...

Actually, Creeley contributes an essay to this publication.  I also recommend Robert Pinsky's essay, especially to those who have not yet encountered his work: it is a fine introduction to his sensibility and poetics.

http://164.109.48.86/products/pubs/writers/pinsky.htm

What Pinsky refers to as the "provincialism of time" -- i.e., "living without the resonance of history, inhabiting the present with a childlike complacency" -- is something I think I see in a lot of the talk about political art and writing.

Perhaps engaged writers -- and would-be avant-gardists -- must necessarily "inhabit the present" because their goals are relatively short-term: a change of direction in art or politics to be accomplished in this lifetime.

But what about political writing that tries to serve the interests of those who will be alive 500 years from now?

Thank you for the follow-up, Mairead. I will look at the Ubu sight. I (maybe
obviously) like interpreting the Memorial as a poem.  It is an interesting
question as how Maya Lin is framed and/or identified. Is she sculptor, poet
or  a conceptual artist who works with a variety of inputs (land, language,
sculptural materials) to create a work of art that amalgamates each of these
inputs into a whole - that may be identified just as much as a work of
language (with elements that correspond to the practice of poetry, the art
of making books and reading) as well as a sculptural work whose materials
locate in a landscape that impact its "reading" in ways that violate &
liberate - or certainly enhance - the conventions of reading a book.
Careers - it seems - are sustained by unilateral definitions (poet, painter,
etc.). Success in poetry, as we know, rarely transforms directly to many
dollars - as say different to success in other media.  Bill Viola - clearly
a conceptual thinker,  among others,  has made Multi-media Artist - it seems
to me - an acceptable "career" definition Jenny Holzer - tho she is clearly
a writer - is not going to call herself one.
So I suspect Maya Lin - the sculptor - knows full well the consequences of
altering her professional identity to prioritize the ways in which writing
is implicit to her work. I mean I don't see her ever starting to say that
she's a poet who works with sculptural materials (which is what I think you
are suggesting) - which makes it hard for the Memorial - in effect - to be
re-defined and revered as a work with poetry at its root  - and that the
work (in addition to all of its other aspects) should also be seen in the
light of this country's literature and interpreted as one of it's major - if
not most major - elegies.

Lots of luck with changing/broadening literary genre critical canons as
well!

Jeffrey, et. al.,

Just a couple comments on Jeffrey Jullich=92s thoughtful consideration of the
problems of  =93antiwar poetry.=94  Altieri=92s notion=97and indeed, most poetry
critics=92 doxa=97that Vietnam War antiwar poems =93fail,=94 begs the question
regarding their failure.  What is an antiwar poem trying to do?  For me, poets
like Denise Levertov, Robert Lowell, regardless of their =93failures=94=97and
indeed, many of Levertov=92s antiwar poems fail even in their rhetorical task of
convincing others to oppose war=97provided with me, a young poet, with models of
how poets can engage in the construction of a counternarrative of the war.  I
learned more about the antiwar movement in Berkeley from Levertov=92s =93Notebook=94
than I did from just about any other source, including the useful documentary,
=93Berkeley in the Sixties.=94  Levertov, following the lead of Pound, Rukeyser,
Williams, and others, included such amusing found texts as a flyer from the
movement, which suggested that people fly kites at demonstrations=97for
aesthetic and practical reasons=97to keep the helicopters away.  Now, I am not
going to lie in the buffalo poetics listserv road and say I=92ll die for that
poem, but one of the things, it seems to me, that folks like Levertov did
well, was provide a lyric testimony and narrative of war resistance.  Other
poets, equally square in terms of their aesthetics, like William Stafford,
have written a corpus of poems working on a poetics of pacifism.  Stafford and
Mac Low, for me, represent the polar possibilities of working out what
anarcho-pacifism might look like in poetry.  So, I understand Watten=92s
distrust of Levertov=92s rhetorical gestures, and Altieri=92s dislike of much
antiwar poetry=97but wouldn=92t we say the same thing about any group of poems?

Subject: Re: anti-war poetry reading

I hope some of these Buffalo anti-war poetry
readers/explorers report back on the event. I'm very
curious: Tim's question ("What might anti-war
literature look like today, in a time quite different
than the 60s/70s, the period we reflexively think of
when discussing an anti-war movement. How has
theory/poetics changed how we approach this subject?
What's at stake here?") couldn't be more timely to our
agreed purpose of poetics nor, to me, more
bewildering. I wanted to follow up on Joe Safdie's
recent post about the same problem ("imaginative art
that can incorporate some response to -- and even
provide a chronicle of -- this recent chain of
terrifying events. I feel that the poets alive today
will eventually be seen as among the most shameful
practitioners of the art if we don't produce such
work"; see

http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=3Dind0211&L=3Dpoetics&P=3DR50484&I=3D-3&m=3D57246),

but it was a topic no one pursued. I tracked down
Barrett Watten's ~Critical Inquiry~ essay, "The Turn
toward Language in the 60s," and Andrea Brady's
less-harsh-on-Language-Poetry-than-originally-reported
"Grief" essay in ~Radical Philosophy,~ hoping for some
guiding light,--- but was left just as mystified (W.S.
Merwin's opacity, a precursor to Language Poetry??)
and stymied by the trail of cookie crumbs leading
further into a dark forest with the Charles Altieri
reference that only elsewhere would prove why Denise
Levertov's political transparency had become laughable
and unsupportable.

Recently, I went through a series of back-channels
with someone who wrote me exhorting that any future
issues of the journal that I edited, LOGOPOEIA

( http://www.logopoeialogopoeia.da.ru/ ),

dedicate it more to a recommitment to

political poetry,

a "dare" I still find myself baffled over, ---as no
one in fact seems to be ~writing~ that kind of poetry,
at least in explicit/content-based terms. ...Or, as
Altieri may have said, that it leads almost
immediately into "bad" poetry.

Joe wrote that "abstract and apolitical lyrics flood
this listserv", and, among other question marks, I was
left wondering--- whether by "abstract" what he wasn't
rather hitting upon might be that Pater's dictum of
"all arts aspire to the condition of music" has in
fact been ~reached~ in "our style" of poetry; and if
that plateau, which he sees as "abstract," doesn't
engender brand new problems as far as political
referentialism--- much like a composer of instrumental
music asking how new music could be political or
anti-war. (Are those shadows of lumbering giants that
I hear Prokofiev orchestrating into the symphonies of
his that I've been listening to this week abstract
critiques of Stalinism? Isn't the politics of
monarchy ~audible~ in the abstract music that the
Esterhazys commissioned? ...And likewise an
anti-anti-semitism / anti-eugenic-exclusivism equally
materialized in the tonal all-inclusiveness of Second
Vienna School twelve-tonality, etc., etc., etc.?)

I wonder too, unlike the allegedly risible Levertov
poem that reported about her actual protesters' park
occupation experience, whether the first kind of new
anti-war or political poetry that facilely comes to
mind wouldn't in fact be poetry about ~media
representations~ of the political
(newspapers/television), and hence actually a boojum
of ---excuse me--- Baudrillard's hyperreal, rather
than realpolitik. I.e., is it political to say "This
is what I read in the newspaper"?

Etc.

Barrett Watten's recent post about Tanya and the
Simbionese Liberation Army as examples of "radical
irrationalism" was tantalizing,--- but it left the
reader desperately in need of elaboration: When Watten
says "I would propose that current social discourses
of terrorism derive from such events", was he
proposing it ~proscriptively,~ in the sense that what
the world (and poetry) needs now is a ~return~ to
Simbionese-style radical irrationalism, sweet radical
irrationalism, hence to build a political poetry upon
its own comedic ungroundedness,---

or did he mean that recuperation into
state-vs.-revolutionary irrationalism became the
subsequent discursive ~imprisonment~ that ~prevents~
political poetry?

I also tried reading Daniel Davidson's 2002 Krupskaya
book, ~Culture,~ because Ben Friedlander and Gary
Sullivan blurb it as being quintessentially political
(SPD catalog: "One question was foremost in his mind:
just how far can experimental be construed as direct
political action?"; B.F.: "Politics for Dan Davidson
was a site-specific performance art"),--- but, for me,
the book may have crossed over that "just how far"
line and ~no longer~ be so construable, as I was at a
near-total loss to recognize its hermetic
politicality.

The recurrent craving that these calls to a
neo-political poetry seem to be expressing is for a
poetry other than the formalism-as-politics that
Language Poetry so convincingly theorized.

So, I find myself thrown back upon the politicality of
minor canonical examples, like the proto-~Paradise~
neo-Latin "In Quintum Novembris" that the 17-year old
John Milton wrote in reaction to Guy Fawkes'
("terrorist") gunpowder plot to explode Parliament
House,--- which enacts its poetic politicism entirely
through an imagination of The Beyond: "You have it in
your power to scatter their dismembered bodies through
the air, to burn them to cinders, by exploding nitrous
powder under the halls where they will assemble"
("Atque dare in cineres, nitrati pulveris igne /
Aedibus iniecto, qua convenere, sub imis": trans. [?]
Merritt Y. Hughes, ~John Milton: Complete Poems and
Major Prose,~ p. 18).


I might mention the recent (failed?) attempt of the
e-journal http://www.newmediapoets.com/nmp.html, which
entered into its dedication to drumming up a new
political poetry with even a ~manifesto~ in tow,
against the anachronistic limbo of most current
poetry: "We are a movement of engagement. Always
engaged, we articulate our participation in a culture,
in an economy, in a particular country, now ... We see
beauty in nouns and names, proper and otherwise: Tiger
Woods ... We know these names to be within the
perimeters of the poetic...", however collecting
somewhat oblique work, itself.

(I should add, I genuinely do believe that the diptych
of poems Garrett Kalleberg published in LOGOPOEIA were
some of the first, best, "post-9/11" poetry I've read:
"I take a draw on a cigarette / which pulls a young
Pakistani man=92s / hand holding an oiled cloth down the
length / of the barrel of a gun...".)

Has anyone read the O Books journal Enough that Leslie
Scalapino edited, which also addressed "anti-war
poetry" (SPD: "based on the theme 'Seeing is a form of
change,' this issue investigates warfare and the World
Trade Center bombing", with poetry by our A-List:
McClure, Notley, Bernstein, Davies, A. Berrigan,
Hofer, Joris, Darragh/Inman, Osman, etc., etc.,...)?

Just copyediting a MS here for the Raworth issue by David Ball.  At one

O refuse to be seduced by cash or offersof travel at the expense of subtle
distortions: the greatest patriots are those who are most keenly critical. I
was just reading about Peter Arnett in Baghdad (he and the CNN were some of
the very few - in fact at one stage he was the only American (he became an
US citizen) reporting on the war) his battle for truth was not only against
the distoprtions of Hussein and his aides etc (who wernt always obstructive)
but againts the US Military and the Pentagon and the Government as well as
sckeptcism from colleagues: he ws not, like Pilger, "radical", but in a
sense was an "ambassador" now that kind of "real" activity is ultimately
appreciated...dubious of writers from the US presenting things to foreign
people and not into the US!!  It would be betterif the West financed people
outside the US to report their views on America...and not all of that would
be hate meil: point being there would be pecadilloes...no Government likes
the "truth" the truth they present wins votes (in the US  "votes" and
overseas "support"  there's not much difference) but the other truths
frighten them.

I have a gut feeling that this Billy Collins is a bit of a cheesey dick
head: but that's only a feeling and I havent met the man......

The CIA like The Voice of America carry out typical Govt. relationship
exercises and ou wouldnt expect them t be all negative to the US...the
danger is when they cut any criticism.

But Id rather see other writers from Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan
Kuwait, Kurdistan, Pakistan' China, Texas,  India, Indonesia, the
Philllipines (and i suppose also the Central American Countires  any
countries' people other than Americans!) and many others writing about the
US and the West.

Berrigan's work. Hi poetry was good: he was also in jail ? I think that's
correct. A brave man.

The Heel

Wittgenstein asks, "One can own a mirror; does one then own the reflection
seen in it?" You don't own the mirror, either. Paint peels, metal
oxidizes. The seconds pass, your sphere of habits can't stop that, your
life, other lives, a field blown by the earth's turning, hardly
noticeable, hardly. A little whisper, that's all fear is. "You make your
biggest mark the moment you hit the earth, then comes the pinch, then the
small change." The body is a door to dust. With every step, you try its
worn knob.

Spread the word. Far and wide,

Actually, I believe that both Berrigan brothers (Philip and Daniel)
wrote poetry, though Daniel was better known for his. I was looking
around for some poems by Philip, but haven't found any as yet.

Both brothers (and others in their families) did jail time. Some years
ago, I read that in the Berrigan circle there were family conferences
before various demonstrations to decide who was *not* going to
jail and would stay home to take care of kids, etc.

The Catonsville 9, the Harrisburg 7, and other such groups included
others besides the Berrigan brothers, of course. I have trouble
remembering the numbers because I remember so well seeing the
two brothers there in the photos.

This is a project of Bill Luoma's which, thankfully, mercifully, I have
found impossible to figure out. Even after receiving a note about it from
Bill. Just go to the top and type in a word. Then hit- NEW PAGE-. Today I
happen to run into Tony Torn with his wife Lee Ann Brown and her parents.
Lee Ann is about to give birth any minute, and the grandparents (it's their
first) were very excited. Lee Ann is a week overdue. So I typed in the name
Tony Torn at the top, and sure enough, a picture of Tony showed up, with his
hair very long and wearing a bandana, with another man looking like he is
wearing a pirate hat and boxing gloves with his arms around Tony from the
back. Possibly from a play Tony was in? Underneath the picture was the name-
Christopher Alexander. So just bring up the page, go to the top and type in
anything. Then hit -NEW PAGE- and see what happens.

"Under the Sun operates on the small stages of intimate conflict and
longing, but casts light outside the ring: we see the shadows of the crowd,
we smell the dirty water that slaps against the piers. It's a formulation
and un-doing of the personal. Intimacy excavated yields characters, ironic
and adrift, who quiver in the jackets of their names. We know them by
contact, or contract, an occupation of looks and resistance. The poem enact=
s
the force of situated desire. Under the Sun is brilliant wit wrenching
poetics: a word stream taking its shirt off."
=8BCamille Roy=20

"I am struck by the intellectual verve of this poem, its complex sense of
the architecture of the poem as it responds to diverse literary traditions.
This long poem creates rooms of and room for playfulness, humour, political
anger, and aesthetic pleasures. It isn't static; it moves; it reads itself
and interrogates.
=8BCarla Harryman

"Rachel Levitsky brilliantly designs mysterious flying objects of language
and of desire, as she succeeds in giving each word an intriguing span of
life.  Her poems are theater, teaser, solution, entretien de tension which
keep meaning and its boundaries open for intimate manuvres of reading."
=8BNicole Brossard

Rachel Levitsky is the author of four previous chapbooks of poetry,
Cartographies of Error (Leroy Chapbooks), 2[1x1] Portraits (Baksun), Dearly
(A + Bend Press) and The Adventures of Yaya and Grace (Potes and Poets). He=
r
work has appeared in numerous magazines. She lives and works in New York
where she curates the Belladonna reading series and chapbooks series at
Bluestockings Womens Bookstore.

There's an elegant Read Me file explaining the project at this URL:

http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~luoma/peace/readme.txt

maybe this will alleviate weird feelings: it is grabbing
text about the search
string from Google, and so starting with a poet's name is likely to
produce lots of poetics-related or personally-relevant results.

that is some interesting work, IMO.

>>> Robert Olen Butler, David Herbert Donald and Richard Ford; the American
>>> poet laureate, Billy Collins; two Arab-Americans, Naomi Shihab Nye and
>>> Elmaz Abinader; and Robert Pinsky, Charles Johnson, Bharati Mukherjee
>>> and Sven Birkerts. They were all asked to write about what it means to
>>> be an American writer.
>>>
>>> Although the State Department plans to distribute the 60-page booklet of
>>> 15 essays free at American embassies worldwide in the next few weeks,
>>> one country has already banned the anthology: the United States. The
>>> Smith-Mundt Act of 1948, renewed when the United States Information
>>> Agency became part of the State Department three years ago, bars the
>>> domestic dissemination of official American information aimed at foreign
>>> audiences.
>>>
>>> "There were Congressional fears of the government propagandizing the
>>> American people," said George Clack, the State Department editor who
>>> produced the anthology. The essays can, however, be read on a government
>>> Web site intended for foreigners
>>> (usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/writers). "We do not provide that
>>> address to U.S. citizens," Mr. Clack said, adding, "Technology has made
>>> a law obsolete, but the law lives on."
>>>
>>> Despite the domestic blackout, the participants are focused on the
>>> potential abroad. "There is the perception abroad that Americans feel
>>> culturally superior and are intellectually indifferent," said Mr. Ford,
>>> who won the Pulitzer in 1996 for his novel "Independence Day." "Those
>>> stereotypes need to be burst." He added that he was eager to go to
>>> Islamic nations to help "humanize America" and present a more diverse
>>> picture of public opinion than is conveyed by the Bush administration.
>>> "With a government like the one we have, when not even 50 percent of
>>> Americans voted for the president, the diversity of opinion is not
>>> represented," he said.
>>>
>>> Stuart Holliday, a former White House aide to President Bush who is
>>> overseeing the anthology publication as coordinator of the State
>>> Department's Office of International Information Programs, said: "We're
>>> shining a spotlight on those aspects of our culture that tell the
>>> American story. The volume of material is there. The question is how can
>>> it be augmented to give a clearer picture of who we are."
>>>
>>> Before the cold war ended, the United States often sent orchestras,
>>> dance troupes and other artists abroad to infiltrate Communist societies
>>> culturally. Writers like John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut, Edward Albee and E.
>>> L. Doctorow gave government-sponsored readings in Eastern Europe that
>>> used literature on behalf of American interests.
>>>
>>> "People lined up for blocks," recalled William H. Luers, a former
>>> American ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later president of the
>>> Metropolitan Museum of Art, speaking of Mr. Updike's appearance at the
>>> embassy in Prague in the mid-1980's.
>>>
>>> But the United States Information Agency, which ran that campaign, was
>>> folded into the State Department in 1999, and over the last 10 years
>>> such programs have been severely reduced.
>>>
>>> Since 9/11, though, the State Department has increased its efforts to
>>> communicate American values to overseas audiences. Mr. Holliday
>>> described the anthology, for example, as complementing efforts by
>>> Charlotte Beers, a former Madison Avenue advertising executive who is
>>> now under secretary of state for public diplomacy, to sell the United
>>> States to often hostile Muslim populations.
>>>
>>> Her campaign includes "Next Chapter," a television show broadcast by the
>>> Voice of America in Iran, a worldwide traveling exhibition of
>>> photographs of the ravaged World Trade Center site by Joel Meyerowitz,
>>> the distribution of videos spotlighting tolerance for American Muslims
>>> and a pamphlet showing Muslims as part of mainstream American life.
>>>
>>> Christopher Ross, the State Department's special coordinator for public
>>> diplomacy, has advocated reviving official cultural programs abroad as a
>>> "cost-effective investment to ensure U.S. national security" and a way
>>> to combat "the skewed, negative and unrepresentative" image of America
>>> that he says most people of the world absorb through mass culture and
>>> communications. Yet even some of the authors expressed mixed feelings
>>> about just how effective such cultural exposure would ultimately prove.
>>>
>>> In an interview, Billy Collins quoted Auden's famous line that "poetry
>>> makes nothing happen," but Mr. Collins tempered that comment by adding:
>>> "I think there are some cases where it can. I don't think a group of
>>> American writers is going to bring peace to the Middle East, but it puts
>>> something in the media that is a counterbalance to the growling and
>>> hostilities that fill the pages. It would have a positive and softening
>>> influence on things." And while Mr. Collins said he has agreed to join a
>>> tour abroad, he added, "It's not a particularly good time for unarmed
>>> American poets to be wandering around Jordan and Syria."
>>>
>>> Ms. Abinader was more optimistic about the potential for the literary
>>> initiative to change foreign perceptions. "I don't think I'm going to
>>> grab a terrorist by the lapels and say, `There's a better way of doing
>>> things,' " she said. "But what you can do is inspire a different kind of
>>> power. That's the power of the word."
>>>
>>> Some of the anthology's authors, paid $2,499 by the government, praise
>>> the freedoms they enjoy in the United States, but the collection by no
>>> means presents an uncritical picture of the United States. Julia
>>> Alvarez, a novelist and poet who moved from the Dominican Republic when
>>> she was young, writes that America is not "free of problems or
>>> inequalities or even hypocrisies." Robert Olen Butler says that the
>>> United States, though `built on the preservation of the rights of
>>> minorities, has sometimes been slow to apply those rights fully."
>>> Michael Chabon tells of crime and racial unrest in his hometown,
>>> Columbia, Md.
>>>
>>> The poet Robert Creeley said that although the Sept. 11 attacks led to
>>> an outpouring of poetry to express sorrow, this "passed quickly as the
>>> country regained its equilibrium, turned to the conduct of an aggressive
>>> war and, one has to recognize, went back to making money."
>>>
>>> Ms. Abinader, the daughter of Lebanese immigrants to Pennsylvania,
>>> recalls being subjected to racist remarks by her classmates because of
>>> her dark complexion. Later in her academic career, she says, "feelings
>>> toward Arabs became more negative and sometimes bordered on distrust,
>>> even from my own colleagues."
>>>
>>> The other Arab-American in the volume, Naomi Shihab Nye, was asked to
>>> contribute after the State Department took note of an open letter she
>>> wrote "to any would-be terrorists" the week after Sept. 11. "I beg you,
>>> as your distant Arab cousin, as your American neighbor, listen to me,"
>>> she wrote in the letter distributed on the Internet and printed in
>>> several Arabic-language newspapers. "Our hearts are broken, as yours may
>>> also feel broken in some ways we can't understand unless you tell us in
>>> words. Killing people won't tell us. We can't read that message. Find
>>> another way to live. Don't expect others to be like you."
>>>
>>> Some 31,000 English-language copies of the new anthology will be
>>> available abroad. Editions in Arabic, French, Spanish and Russian are
>>> also being prepared. Additional translations into two dozen other
>>> languages are expected, with a total of about 100,000 copies likely to
>>> be distributed in the next few years. Mr. Holliday said he hoped that
>>> the essays would also be reprinted in foreign newspapers and that
>>> students abroad would use the texts as course material and to learn
>>> English.
>>>
>>> All but one of the articles appear for the first time in the volume; the
>>> essay by Mr. Chabon is a reprint.
>>>
>>> Mr. Luers applauded the anthology but urged a more coordinated and
>>> intensive program of cultural diplomacy. "We have to find ways to convey
>>> not just propaganda but the richness of this country's culture," he
>>> said. "It's pathetic that we don't make an effort. Very educated people

And there's another brother, Jerry Berrigan, who also write poetry, was also
a priest, and was also involved in some of the activities of the sixties,
but moreover has been more active in the Catholic Worker movement, having
worked with Dorothy Day in Syracuse and elsewhere.

these are good points.  i for one, am not willing to write off allen
ginsberg's antics as "bad poetry" or acknowledge that vietnam-era
protest poetry "failed."  failed to do what?  it certainly helped,
along with mass movements, insurgency, fragging, etc etc (see Michael
Bibby's Hearts and Minds, about Viet Nam era political poetry,
including a great chapter on anti-war GI movement publications), to
get the US out of the war.

It's been ages since I have read Stafford and don't have a book of his in
the house. But a line in a poem he wrote (I believe) during World War II,
resonates with my sense of what's going on in the name of national security=
:

We live in an occupied country, Becky

Other than a sense of surrounding darkness, I forget the rest.
Another book I do not have is Carolyn Forche's Norton Anthology of War poem=
s
- which may now be historically instructive. Her own work on El Salvador in
the seventies & eighties (particularly the one about the General and the
severed Rebel ears) was a genuine consciousness raising episode at readings=
.
The poem definitely got under the skin of this country's overt and covert
support of the Contras in both Nicaragua and El Salvador  -  both wars also
travesties in terms of North American right wing agendas.
"Sincerity" as a poetic strategy (a very common stance in much Viet-Nam
anti-war work) always struck me as more self-serving than instrumental in
changing a public point of view. I suspect one of the big things learned is
how limited so much of American modernist poetix is when it comes to gettin=
g
outside its box. Levertov's cultural insularity made her work, for example,
about El Salvadorians both sentimental and patronizing (no matter her stron=
g
political support for the rebels). I imagine the El Salvadorians - if they
heard her - wondered who she was imagining, or it gave them, I suspect,
'missionary shivers'.  The experience made me want to go back and read her
'real' work. =20
But I agree with Maria D that to apply a broad dismissive cloth is totally
misleading and off the mark(s). Cumulatively - like it in sum or in parts -
it was significant. (It's taken a whole bunch of years for the Right to be
able to - shamelessly - bring back Eliot Abrams and Admiral Poindexter -
both of whom were once convicted for lying and stripped of any public
credibility). And, on the poetry side, Robert Bly, a primary lead in
anti-war poetry events,  will undoubtedly be at it again!
Now, I suspect,  new work will be made in direct response (going back to
Stafford) to the new "occupation" - and strategies will be cyber-marked - a
domestic war against occupation that will, in part, be fought over or
against the control of virtual space combined with knocks on the door.
Language - how it leaves and how it arrives, the improvisation of new
strategies - will be as important as ever. "Homeland" and "Security" will b=
e
highly tested definitions, as well as new determinations and wars over who
and what forms control  "public and cultural space."

This is getting too serious. One thing I certainly miss from Allen Ginsberg
was his great sense of public good humor. It often managed to suck a lot of
paranoia out of the air. I hope the new work can bring that back to the
plate. The kites are OK!

Poet Laureate Billy Collins recalls being dumbfounded during his first
reading of Ashbery's poetry, which he likens to language that has been
sprayed with WD-40, so that the words slip from their proper positions
and slide around the page.

It is wonderful.  It takes search results (including images) from
sources including various newspapers and listservs, but not only from
the name together (if you type in a name or phrase) but from the words
in the phrase separately.  It recombines the results, using at least
some syntax from Stein, it seems.  I particularly like the way in which
names are linked with "mail to"s to completely different people than
those named in the link.  If you type in the same thing over and over
the words split apart nicely, reducing to repeated character strings.

Be well,

I may be in the tiny minority, but I dislike the Vietnam memorial and have
never considered it great art. To me the idea of indiscriminately mixing up
the names of the dead - and only Americans, it should be noted, so the
picture it represents is very one-sided and FAR from complete - is the wrong
way to memorialize the people who died in this war. It places knowing
butchers and involuntary draftees in proximity to each other without any
kind of consideration of the relative value of each. It's a dubiously amoral
piece in this regard and not the least bit anti-war that I can see. I also
find its big stone blocks to be a form of mystification that ennobles war in
a way by making it seem inscrutable and timeless.

I hope I don't offend anybody by these comments, but I just wanted to speak
out and add my own rather roughly hewn view of a work I frankly know little
about and admire not at all. You may all choose to ignore me in scornful
silence, which would be fine.

for those of us who are Catholics, Progressives and Poets the Berrigans were
as important as Merton, or Dorothy Day, or many others. In the great and
good things that happened after the Second Vatican Council and before the
current darkness in Rome crushed them the Berrigans were a light and they
along with Father Jose Cardenal, Dom Helder Camarra, Dorothy Day and Thomas
Merton gave us all hope.

wanted to draw some attention to george packer's article in ~the new
york times magazine~ today, "the liberal quandary over iraq," which
raises in my view salient points re the status of liberal hawks
(let's say) of various stripes... i think i find mself closest to the
"secularist" position, as packer has it, of folks like leon
wieseltier, probably owing in part to my mother's wwii experiences...
other categories incl. "theorist" (michael walzer), "romantic"
(christopher hitchens), "skeptic" (david rieff), and "idealist" (paul
berman)---all of which appeal to me in various ways, albeit i find
problems with each...

worth reading...

    In either '69 or '70..early winter day like this..i had a bad acid

stupid case of chase and hide..and the police lobbing back??

     4 Junior Members of the faculty..two i think from the Eng. Dept...one
certainly Rbt Hass..arrested in a protest...made the front page of Buf.
News..being placed in the police van..and the NYtimes...

     In an early protest..throwing a rock thru a bank window..i think they
were pissy about some check thing...

     Never finishing a term out...for the first x years...making some

I've been selected for the State Department Collection as well.  I'm being serious.  Hey, I'm more surprised than you are.

Actually my selection might be due to a number of reasons, mainly that I'm a longtime close friend of the Powell family (we don't talk about My Lai at the dinner table, but Vernon Lake is surely a high watermark of pride).  Well, that, and lately I've started a wonderfuly shallow relationship with that incredible poet, Billy Collins.  Oh BC's a good guy; he'd laugh at being called shallow.

Besides, I actually helped initiate the project.  And so in a sense my inclusion targets the 20-35 yr old male jihadi market.  BC's a genius, you know; he's thinking ahead.  I'm down with all them DC motherfuckers!  Word to the DC posse!  Seriously.  They're actually some really cool dudes.

Take my word for it, or not.  Like, whatever.  I don't need you motherfuckers anymore.  The DC Posse seem to dig my "back to roots authenticty" which is what Collins called it just last week.  They want to show that they're down with anti-US sentiment and skaz, American style!

Here's my poem they're going to publish, dedicated to all you motherfuckers out there, and you know who you are:

Dear M,

I have never seen the Vietnam Veterans Memorial but would like too.
Like all entrants to the contest, Maya Lin was presented with the
problem of how to present all the names of the American missing and
killed in action.  This was the bottom line presented by the Veterans.
I understood that the names are presented according to the dates they
were killed , or reported missing.  I know she writes about the
arrangement as a way to facilitate people who served with them.  I have
no strong feelings about the work, barring an interest in how she
describes it as a book, and what she describes as the "miracle" that it
was made at all, and of course I'd like to see it.  I am interested in
her process and conceptualization in general, as exemplified by the
Civil Rights Memorial, or the Langston Hughes Library, or the piece
commemorating the registration of women at Yale (I think: I don't have
my book here; in fact, it's not my book but the library's).  As a matter
of interest, I just got a book called "As Seen on Both Sides: American
and Vietnamese Artists Look at the War (Indochina Arts Project and the
William Joiner Foundation, Boston, MA, Distrib. U Mass Press, 1991), and
I will take this discussion and your reflections into my reading of it.

I may be in the tiny minority, but I dislike the Vietnam memorial and
have
never considered it great art. To me the idea of indiscriminately mixing
up
the names of the dead - and only Americans, it should be noted, so the
picture it represents is very one-sided and FAR from complete - is the
wrong
way to memorialize the people who died in this war. It places knowing
butchers and involuntary draftees in proximity to each other without any
kind of consideration of the relative value of each. It's a dubiously
amoral
piece in this regard and not the least bit anti-war that I can see. I
also
find its big stone blocks to be a form of mystification that ennobles
war in
a way by making it seem inscrutable and timeless.

I hope I don't offend anybody by these comments, but I just wanted to
speak
out and add my own rather roughly hewn view of a work I frankly know
little
about and admire not at all. You may all choose to ignore me in scornful
silence, which would be fine.

The new Roots Album "Phrenology"
features a spoken word track by
Amiri Baraka called
"SOMETHING IN THE WAY OF THINGS (IN TOWN)"

The liner notes:

"The voice watching death that New Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey would
love to silence.....but never could:  Amiri Baraka"


"Phrenology" came out last Tuesday.  It's the sixth (by my count) record by
the Philadelphia-based Hip-Hop group.  The Baraka track is over 6 minutes
long, unfortunately the lyrics aren't printed in the liner notes.  The song
marks the 100th track by The Roots.

Yep, Creeley wrote an article. And, I find it a bit odd that Sven Birkerts

Dear Kristin,

I recently submitted four poems to 580 Split. Two of these will be published
in the next issue (Feb 2003) of Bird Dog magazine: "How to Jump Horses" and
"Noun Called Witness".

This is my immediate notification to you of the work being accepted
elsewhere. I included two other poems in my query to you: "Disentangle" and
"This Wife of Mine, She". These are still unpublished as of this date.

Thank you for your attention in this matter. And thank you for your
editorial generosity in accepting simultaneous submissions.

Sincerely,

Jane Sprague

I dont know it, naturally, as I am in NZ:  but I know what you're saying:
over here they make a fuss about the lost in the two Great Wars and there
are also Vietnam War and Korean War veterans. I dont know why they do this
...I do know they're ...well I do ....its the honouring of the dead and so
on and I think that eg the war of the US and the Allies versus Japan and
Germany were "just" wars but the Vietnam War is a dubious one:there have
been movies of course not all of which - in fact Born on the 4th of July
from memory is basically anti war ...being anti war per se though is not
enough: there are just and unjust wars...  But, I know a guy believes wars
are not only always to be with us but are neccessary: somehow he has a
theory of war that makes it a kind of "test": so as to war he thinks war
will always be with us: is (for him )a natural condition...he has a "vested
interest" in war as he collects war books which means I have a "vested
"interest on keeping in his good books!! (As I sell books to him - however:
he is studying history and sociology an Uni so maybe some of the more
liberal ideas may rub of on him).

But thinking about what MWP (you) and others have said its strange how some
people can have such a great enthusiasm for War!?  Even the guy I mentioned:
him especially - as he was shot twice a close range by a bloke with a shot
gun and nearly died (when he was playing around with somne woman in the US
and the ex husband or the husband turned up ina military uniform and with a
gun)  (I've seen the scars and his story is so vivid I believe it): but my
my experience of  life teaches me to avoid things that hurt (not all things
as one has to "engage" with life I aknowledge that): now that may be
"cowardice" but if so then I have to admit to it....I think it takes courage
to critique when one is actually a very nervous and sensitive person...when
one is what might be called (on the face of it ) a "wimp"....

And I dont think its unpatriotic to critique one's Government or the fact of
war or even to propose some sort of "radical' action be taken: albeit
there's always a doubt: but I dont see that war eg against Iraq is even
remotely of any value...and even the so-called "War against Terrror" is
really what used to be the "War aginst Communism" transformed twisted and
sublimated so to speak.

It pays to be skeptical of Governments and people who want wars I feel.

And what do people think of this guy who believes that war will always be
and not only that:  that War is a neccessity of the human condition? Some of
his arguments for it (albeit they are a bit simplistic) make a kind of
sense...but know that  I dont agree with him just to sell books (!) (well I
do sometimes agree just to stop some crazy and  quite heated arguments etc )
but eg I got him a book about Wilfred Owen and tried to encourage him to
read Pat Barker's marvelous series on the first world war...maybe this pro
war thing is part of his "macho" pysch he cant let go of.... but I recall
being fascinated by guns and war as a small boy but as I went through
adolescence I was able to see that war was actually something in which
people got hurt.

I wonder how much of Freud etal is in that component of a person: that War
both fascinates and repels: and what is the psychology of the present War
Mongers (inside and outside the US) (apart from considerations of greed
etc).

Another guy who seemed to have  a vested interest in War and wars was Peter
Arnett the NZr/American who won the Pulitzer Prize for journalism...(became
an US citizen) hence even as he is "objective" one senses that he too could
say    something like  "well, yes, its possible we could negotiate here: but
the answer is as  the President has said to attack uysing smart bombs etc"
(as in Iraq in 1990) as deep down the adrenalin-power-ambition-excitement pr
whatever was pushing him to wherever there were wars: and he did some "good"
in his reporting (he was at one stage the only US reporter covering the War
as  Iraq only trusted CNN at the time): but one wonders about these "heroic
" figures eg in NZ there was a Maori soldier who killed many Germans but the
guy later went beserk with a knife and killed a man, and his daughter is a
well known (in national politics  (Donna Awatere))and very feisty and
hot-blooded (quite a nasty kettle of fish I think she is)) politician and
her story of her home life makes one wonder if she is actually human!! (some
people I think live amongst so much of this "glory" and domestic violence
they become irreparabley programmed toward agressive "solutions" to
problems)...I feel that remembrance and reverence for the dead can too
easily turn into a Celebration of War. I'm dubious of all those Returned
Soldier organisations...and like Wilfred Owen am dubious of the Glory of
War.

 A counter-example is Keith Douglas who loved war: his poetry is some of the
most extraordinary in have ever read: had he lived he may have become
acclaimed as Britain's  greatest poet (and he had been able to "develop"
formally): but it was his enthusaism for war which eventually cost him his
life....

A lot of questions unanswered.  Richard Taylor.

Perhaps a reply of this length would be better off
submitted to somewhere like Jacket, but (hey, there's
always potlatch)---

Gary Sullivan's dare, "neither reader had really read
what he was writing terribly closely", was a fair
challenge and pretty much the case,--- so I read
through the first 45 pp. of the on-line Davidson .pdf
and went back to re-read ~Culture~ from cover to
cover, this time paying attention (!), underlining,
cross-questioning.   And finding it a much more
agreeable experience, by finally managing to ~by-pass
its misrepresentative marketing.~

My initially perhaps cursory reading of ~Culture~ may
have come down to a reaction to its packaging or
"false advertising," as it were.

Initially, with the boojum of political poetry very
much on my mind, I responded to the SPD catalog's
slanting of the book as political, and went in search
of it for that reason.  Very quickly, I could not
---beyond the broad Language Poetry apologetics of
asyntacticalism as revolution (a dogma to which I am
sympathetic)--- identify its political resonances; and
this omission went on page after page.   Becoming
impatient with the book for not satisfying the promise
its supporters had delivered, I gave up quickly.  They
sold me political poetry but when I unwrapped it, it
was pure poetry.

I was also distrustful, reading the Afterword first,
of how large a role the "Breakdown" software that
Davidson sometimes used played, described as "an
automatic cut & paste generator, taking text and
spewing it out, in reordered syntax, endlessly".
Where I may be sympathetic to such mechanical
prostheses with someone like an Alan Sondheim or their
non-automated versions as used by a Mac Low, because
the works foreground that very robotics,--- I'm
uncomfortable about "wasting" my critical receptivity
(reading) on something that plays
now-you-see-it/now-you-don't with its own
methodologies (and, for example, found my opinion of
his book revised downward by reading Brian Kim
Stefans' readme interview, where he admitted to
extensive use of mechanisms in a book I'd previously,
gullibly read as authorial): my Turing Test scores
just aren't high enough.  I can read my gas meter if I
want to read machinery.

The on-line .pdf (whose contents are completely
different from the Krupskaya book) was quickly
prompting an antipathy in me similar to my first
mishap with ~Culture.~   The .pdf, unlike the book,
however, definitely contains poetry with an
explicit/content-based politics, ---although a
politics that I find to be pallid, strident, clichéd,
and underdeveloped.   But let me put that to the side;
the book, or at least significant sections of it,
became newly rewarding, so it's better to look at how
good Davidson can be (and how wrong, although
well-intentioned, I think Friedlander and Krupskaya
[and to a lesser degree Gary Sullivan, who also offers
other inroads: the Iraqi buttons are immensely
distracting, though] were about what's worthwhile
about it.)  (I confess to having, currently, skipped
over the opening poem, "Product.")

My reaction, frustrated at the struggle it takes to
salvage Davidson's very exquisite passages and
sensitivities from a sort of contamination by imported
influences (and a certain kind of numb blandness he
occasionally made no effort to resist, in the .pdf)
could be summarized as: How A Good Poet Can Be Ruined
By Late 20th Century Poetry Trends.

Davidson writes only long poems: "Product," 20 pages;
"Bureaucrat, my love," 40; "Anomie," 26; and, in the
.pdf, poems 14, 21, and 20 pages.  (...which partially
stoked my impatience reading the .pdf.  Within its
long poems, Davidson favored certain serial or modular
forms, ---prose alternating with verse, the use of
text-box side-bars, numbered sections of italicized
one-word verses followed by regular stanzas--- so that
if I didn't particularly care for a device the first
few times around, I felt burdened confronting an even
lengthier "ad nauseam" of them.  With the .pdf
material, I felt a disinterest akin to ~boredom,~ as
each non sequitur was promising only the next hairpin
turn.  Overstimulation leads to anomie.)

The book's poem "Bureaucrat, My Love" strikes me its
"the best," despite its deceptive title.  (My reading,
from here on, elides the boundaries between separate
poems and reads ~Culture~ all of one piece.)  Yes,
there were, occasionally but ~only~ occasionally,
traces of an identifiable politique

("spirits of deregulation", in the sense that Reagan
made "deregulation" a buzz-word, or the fire arms of
"the handed revolver" [p. 33]; the monetarism that so
plagues the .pdf: "shifting values and wealth";
"armies of mere ideological coincidence" and "stamps
of crime" [34]; "each citizen's perfect cure" [36];
etc.)

but I found those blips rapidly receding in
significance as the meat of Davidson's "real" poetic
concerns took over entirely.  And he could be quite
weak at politics: "the owners assume ownership" [118].
Just as fragmentary as my quotations of them, those
fleeting glimpses of erstwhile politics are embedded
splinter-like in a larger whole that has other, more
compelling concerns.  Politics may have remained
somehow undigested or "split-off" in Davidson.

The poetry in ~Culture~ is not, per se, political by
any means.  Its strengths are that it is

(1) ~philosophical,~ philosophical to the point of
ontological;

(2) it surrenders to rhapsodies of lyricism so
unabashed that they verge upon sentimentality;

(3) it's preoccupied by matters of ~belief~ that
bespeak a near-religious transcendence; and there's a
good return to "non-political" themes such as

(4) dreams,

(5) our physical embodiment and desire in "the body",
"skin", etc (although "The Body", the
body-as-narrative and so on, was very much a
consciously politicized art object in the '90s, after
its representation became the focus of the battle
against the NEA), and

(Addenda) a sense of separation or blockade
(alienation?) epitomized in his concept of "distance"
(glimpsed in the figure of "walls" and the doors that
lead through them).

Each of these Davidsons has to be looked at, to see
how claims about Davidson's political poetry recede
out of proportion.

(1) THE PHILOSOPHICAL DAVIDSON

He re-visits big, macrocosmic concepts, almost Wallace
Stevens-style, such as "world", often very beautifully


(conjoining one abstraction, "world," with another,
infinity: "Cast an eye into the infinite world" [38];
sometimes making the idea tangible by apprehending or
juxtaposing it to the sense of touch, as in: "The
world opens onto a shell and awaits its skin" [57],
"the shape hammers away / and now we are at the center
of the world     link palms and predict" [58], or "the
world wraps completely, / my body" [110]; "to withdraw
from the world would not beg in or begin" [57];
"conditions favor another world     sounding this
rhyme of semitones" [60]),

--- but it has to be kept clear that that sense of
"world" is not on the same experiential plane as, say,
a ~world power~ as a political horizon, or the
politics of New World Order: it's not experienced at
all; it's either theorized or rhapsodized.  Even where
not named verbatim, this cosmological intellection of
his is there, but never mundane: "plastic multiple
universes" [39].   This abstract idea of "world"
perhaps reaches its best, most nuanced and
autobiographical summarization in the line on the
second-to-last page:

   Make the words of many into a world of one thing.

The ~genre~ of that ~idee fixe,~ again, is not
political but has more to do with, say, Schopenhauer's
philosophical tome, ~The World as Will and
Representation~ ("the world is insufficient but has
its place   or I close my eyes" [53]).  Rather than
historical materialism, what he pauses over is "the
real in the imaginary" [30].

What a remarkable, meaningful line, and how true: the
public, collective entity of language ("the words of
many") narrows down to claustrophic monomania ("a
world of one thing"); signification, he implies, is
always a case of obsession.  Indeed, the philosophical
for him is a virtual ~habitation,~ and it operates as
a surrogate locale or location, someplace you can
live: "In slang terms, let's face the town of another
philosophy" [77]; "a reminder of the distant home of
thought" [115].

(2) THE LYRICAL DAVIDSON

Well, beauty's another thing altogether, and you
almost have to sit back and drop jaw and all critical
pretenses and just let it wash over you, he gets so
positively romanticist:

            and then the complexity shakes itself
loose
   and I am repeated   and the fallen air is reaped of
its clay [54]

(This peculiar notion of a person being "repeated,"
---a very different, mysterious and metaphysical
reiteration than the political repetition seen in
Marxist ideology about the social order "reproducing
itself"--- recurs, as though lives came in triplicate:
"Applying a scale of desire, the woman is repeated"
[86].)

More lyrical euphoria:

                    lights dim and glow
   this standing where the shadow of falls has always
been a distant gleam
                       an endless myth

[60]

   Blood bores me   and all the stones   holding still
                          close to the water's edge.

[61]

   Why, the very air derives from short gasps.

[95]


   Late yesterday a scarcity of evening light, as
flowers roam in dust

[96]

His lyricism does what lyricism is good for: meaning,
implication and content are compressed into a
condensation so intact that paraphrase or
interpretation can barely extract its sub-text.
Lyricism tends toward crystalization.  It must be
sung, not understood.

   the resulting bed turned down, remote, warmed and
set upon a
                          further star

[97]

...the courage it takes to revert to such unapologetic
poeticisms ("a further star")!  The gamble, though, is
always that quasi-archaic poeticisms bring with them a
thoroughly resolved and conventionalized emotional
connotation, that is, sentimentality:

   As touch out-paces the dim outline, hands grow
lucid and charmed. ...
   The grey-green dusk of morning presents an offering

[103]

But he's not in the least ashamed of such indulgence.
The book ends on a tremolo violin crescendo of lines
whose melodrama rivals the line "Here and there, in
cold pockets / Of rememberance, whispers out of time"
(the conclusion of "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror")
in their endearing raptures of weepiness (which I like
very much):

   the related, silvered pastures of moonlight
   the instant passing of a face in the distance
   if tomorrow, or yesterday, or barely out of sight.
   This is what we brought to take with us
   then couldn't find.  Even then
   the wasted, watered landscape grows
   faint, constellations seen to glow
   when looked at from beneath another side.

This lyricism throughout ~Culture~ functions as a
departure into The Sublime, with all its many
definitions, principally a zone of feeling in
equilibrium that is immune or oppositional to the
think-think-think passions of his philosophical side.
(See Addendum on "absorption", below.)

(3) DAVIDSON THE TRUE BELIEVER

He doesn't in the least blink away from (avoid) a very
~counter-political~ vocabulary of religion, and a
Judaeo-Christianized one at that ---"grace," "litany,"
"sacrifice," the "offering" that "morning presents"
(above), "impenitence," prayer, "sanctuary," sacred
music, etc.:

"faces emerge in a state of grace" [53]; "absorbing
moments / before a deepening litany   anonymous / as
though we haven't looked anymore / as the sacrifice
begins" [54]; "impenitence", with all its attendant
redemptions [55]; "gentleness that cold sand prays to
and releases" [58]; "Between named distance and the
sanctuary of fable" [73]; "rock-hymns" [78].

These vestiges of ~faith~ that are operative
throughout ~Culture~ may take as their object
desiderata other than theology's, but the underlying
mental (or spiritual) action remains the same, one of
belief; the direct object changes, but the verb is the
same: "Belief in nouns walk free" [96]; "unassigned
disengaged / unbelieving  running fingers over its
surface" [59]; "pearl of belief" [99] (~vide~ the
Christological figure of "the pearl of great worth" as
a metaphor for faith).

The residue of creed shows so much through the
surface, that ~Culture~ has motifs of hymnology that
it revises, the way Ives' Third Symphony is filled
with old hymn tunes: "Mine eyes have seen the glory or
what submits" [70] (original verse: "Mine eyes have
seen the glory / ~Of the coming of The Lord."~)
(Inasmuch as the same hymn may in fact be an anthem,
The Battle Hymn of The Republic, the example would be
ambiguous in favor of whether the material were
religious/fideistic or political,--- except that
similar latent content reappears elsewhere in
~Culture~ as unambiguously part of the
~belief~-paradigm: "belief / handles its sword".
~Vide~ "His terrible swift sword", from the same
hymn).

(4) DAVIDSON THE DREAMER

It's essential to the rationalism of political
consciousness that it be, first and foremost,
~conscious,~ that is, at the very least ~awake.~  But
~Culture~ is a groggy sort of book that continually
keeps nodding off on itself.  It falls asleeps and
revives and slumbers back into a deeper dream.  And
one does not speak of political dreaming:

even where those dreams  are embraced with an ironic
twinge of sloganeering, as in: "Everyday living
through dreams" [40]; "I woke myself from a dream
and sleep memories" [57]; "In a fond moment of memory
 do we all dream the same dreams" [47]; "the
impenitence fashioning itself into its own / dream a
future of color and shape" [55]; "In the morning
dreams awaken with you" [60]; "Again and again in the
red light   no dream left in pieces" [62]; "I walked
last night to another city, into an other room / ...a
dream... / an endless patterning" [ellipses his, 106];
"sustenance, as an unsustainable waking" [118]; "I am
awakened without sleeping" [34]; as part of a
psychology: "radiant wisdom, grief, sleep" [98]; "the
smallest particle at sleep" [111].

(Am I misinterpreting his use of dreams and sleep, and
is it the inverse of what I'm saying?   Are the dreams
in ~Culture~ a ~bad~ somnolence that stands in
contrast to some healthy rigor of realpolitik thought?
 I can't see how.  Regardless, they function very
importantly, as sleep does, as nocturne, as the lapses
between consciousness, but not, I think, as an
existential nothingness, since sleep in ~Culture~ is
consistently punctuated by the alterity of dream life
which Davidson remembers "fond"-ly (above).)

Sleep is so central an action that the long poem
"Bureacrat, My Love" ends with the line: "doubtless
circles around   as if waking" [64].

(5) THE BODY AND DESIRE

In opposition to Davidson's stratospheric philosphical
thought, he remains mindful of its irreduceable
opposite, the body and the body's sense of touch
("running fingers over its surface" [59]).  It is
often represented by metonymy through the agency of
individual body parts (hands, etc.), but its weight
establishes its imponderability through the full,
undifferentiated presence of "body" ~qua~ "body"
throughout the poetry.

Sometimes the answer that might lie within that body
is interrogated out, to test if it is truly an element
of The Ideal and not of the real ("if my hand touches
the plaster dress / has it already touched its perfect
body?" [57]), and sometimes that body is carefully,
almost supernaturally attended to, apprehended and
even ~heard~ through a kind of synaesthesia ("Listen
to the film in your hands" [61]).  It does not remain
a barrier to the imagination nor does it succumb to
barriers, in a kind of super-human
walk-through-walls/eye-of-the-needle motion ("Outside
of my body I can move through almost any opening"
[52]).  If, in instances, the body appears lost in a
neutered bureaucratese ("my body, compensations,
procedures" [119]), it's invoked just as well in
hypostasized, beatific illumination ("hand-held as
lights without bodies" [115]) or it disappears and is
not seen at all ("where the body goes into hiding"
[49]).

To the arguably slight, slight degree, however, that
~Culture~ still may also retain a minor theme of
politics, as seen in agents of politics such as a
police force ("the guard drops from gravity" [118],
despite that this example happens to find any such
power politics represented as a weak, overpowered
force), that dream-like police force meets the body
not through violence but in semi-eroticized
confrontation with the body's ultimate nakedness:
"Officer strips the body, then the shore" [87] ("body"
retains the secondary meaning of "corpse", which could
lead to an alternative interpretation about mortality
rather than eros); when that body is not completely
stripped, political force still impacts upon it by
seeking to disturb and enter into its ~clothes~ ("All
passengers are noted and searched" [43]).  This theme
of "body" is, then, the antithesis to politics, since
it would be what politics tries to subdue or denude.

Almost like a more quiescent distant relative of
Artaud's "body without organs", it is so much the
kinaesthetic sense organ in its entirety that it
exists as one vast cutaneous surface of skin ("Then is
the enemy that skin does and does not" [70]; "How
beautiful the skin works" [74]; "I complete my skin"
[82]) or a magicalized inner network of capillaries
and arteries ("light enters into the veins" [113];
"Imagine resting, stately veins / brushed against the
surface" [116]).  However multiplicitous its purposes
in ~Culture,~ the body, in the end, may be serving
foremost as a ~measure of all things~ ("zero through
one / about the size of a hand" [58]), a yardstick
that gives the proportions of everything else ("devise
and repeat / the length of scale, each skin" [102]).

{I do not find the alternative, morbid possible
reading of the word "body" to be operative in
~Culture,~ because it seems everywhere counterbalanced
by the vital, appetitive drive of ~desire.~  Indeed,
the two are sometimes unequivocally conjoined, if in a
slightly counterintuitive order ("the substance of
desire / follows hazards of skin" [35]), or the two
words function almost synonymously ("the length of
scale, each skin", and "Applying a scale of desire"
[86]).  It can be a sort of currency or fiduciary
system of exchange in itself ("moves desire between
them" [91]); this interstitial in-betweenness of
desire is a terrain of intermediation, a dividing-line
("this map expects to cross desire" [96]).  Unlike the
stasis that inheres in the alternative reading of the
word, Davidson's "desire" flickers by very quickly and
kinetic ("Each version / displays its organ.  Its
blank light, / the rapid desire" [88]).

THEATER, NOT POLITICS

The central point I'm belaboring here has been that
anything that might have appeared lacking in my
previous assessment of ~Culture~ as "hermetic
politics" is, for one, all too amply demonstrable by
in fact going ahead and reading the book "terribly
closely", since much more elaborated and mutually
cohesive dimensions emerge out of the poetry.  Were I
in fact in error, ---a counter-argument that would
basically have to ignore the evidence of the book
itself (how more terribly closely has anyone else read
it?),--- or how I arrived at that preliminary, more
cursory conclusion was the result, I daresay, of how
the para-literary (blurbs, marketing) can be at
cross-purposes with the literary, and proceed out of
assumptions or information about the ~person~ to the
neglect of the poet.

In defense of that para-literary apparatus, even in
its misdirection, though, there may have been other
hints in the blurb on the back of the book and the
SPD/Kruspskaya that someone else would have found
spoke louder to them than the reiterated promotion of
the book on the basis of its putative but
difficult-to-back-up politics.  Gary Sullivan also
wrote: "He approached the book almost like a method
actor".  And Davidson himself wrote: "An excited
theatre fondles transition" [75]; and he wrote: "act
falling into artifact   theater / invisible" [29];
and, transposing and omitting Bergman's "Cries", he
wrote: "whispers and theaters" [63].  It was all
play-acting.  It's just that somebody else was more
taken in by a face-to-face persona, whereas this
reading is based on his writing.

If politics drains out of ~Culture~ upon closer
inspection, as I think it does here as the stronger,
more introverted, poetic dimensions of the book come
forward, ---these interpretations are consistent in
their all being variations on the ~contemplative~---
that is not to say that the book came utterly without
any valid interpretive key or that his loyal executors
had somehow betrayed the work, necessarily, by
re-casting it in an unbalanced, ungrounded projection
based more on autobiography than on the literature of
the book's actual contents: that may just be the
inevitable distortion that results from all ~ad
hominem~ criticism that concentrates more closely on
the author and the biographical than upon the text
itself.  Equally upon re-examination, it was only ~one
note~ of Friedlander's blurb that Krupskaya seems to
have seized upon in portraying ~Culture~ as political
poetry: "Politics for Dan Davidson was . . .", "action
undreamt by the revolutionaries he admired".
Friedlander also picks up on the same "method actor"
theme of Sullivans's: "Not street theater, but the
street theatricalized . . . a role".

Books don't sell any more if you promote them as
~drama~?

I do not think that I am minimalizing the vestigial
evidence of political consciousness that can be found
in ~Culture~, and hardly in favor of some covert
agenda about the political.  To the contrary, let me
be over-scrupulous at the faintest hint: The fragments
may be there

(a couple of times, a theme of history, or factories;
"armies of mere ideological coincidence" [34]; "yellow
bureaucratese" [39]; "statistical evidence", "another
satisfied customer" [43]; politics as summed up in
law, ----although a law, oddly, associated with the
sartorial: "Everyone violates the law in plain
clothes" [46], and "each fossil   or play of law   or
cloth to wear" [61]; "I live to the fullest extent of
the law" [77]; and his poverty and his aversion to
money re-cast as economics: "I pay rent to a man of
impeccable etiquette" [39]; "Each of my friends has
amassed a supply of wealth" [45]; "foreign debt"
[100])

but those bits and pieces are all too often only a
vacated verbal ~residue~ of the political,
"bureacratese" without any actual bureaucrat ---and
without any true activist,--- that appears at the most
asyntactical junctures and, consequently, at those
points where '90s poetic trends leave meaning and
intention at its most unverifiable.  Sure, I see, here
and there, the trace of a sort of ~scum~ of politics
that floats on the surface of ~Culture.~   But it
isn't, to my ear, ~integrated~ into the composition as
a sufficient structural device for it to be read as
any mainstay or dominant axis of its architecture that
can be interrelated to the other building blocks that
are brought into relief here.  It's a loose shingle in
the building, not a cross-beam.

{If my reading also seems to be overlooking the
portrait of the "suffering" Davidson as a dead-end
that the work is supposed to have prefigured, it's not
because he was some sort of one-dimensional poet too
untalented to have thoroughly included explorations of
pain into his magnum opus, at times quite plaintively
and pianissimo ("a breaking that can't hurt / a barely
discernible scar" [37]), nor one so untalented as to
allow private angst to ~overpower and eclipse~ all
other directions, nor to consign that pain to mere
post-modern stylistic repression ("The codified
systems of silence, hidden by definition" [86]).  The
book's numerous modalities include Existential
insights ("the fresh air-stinging void" [100]), at
times with unbridled, Dionysiac vengence ("what can
only be ripped apart / in tender, supple cuts and
pieces" [117]).  I understate that teleology of
reading a death in reverse backward onto the life it
coincides with (or I do not in fact at all find it as
a sub-text in ~Culture~) because the book that I've
detailed here is so versatile, philharmonic, and
well-articulated that it's too healthy for that; it's
larger than any single, fatal symptomatology (just as
it's larger than political poetry) and I can't imagine
any sound-minded, poetry-literate psychologist having
read it in advance and found some sort of terminal
case warning signal imbedded in it.

{But Davidson appears to have been shrewd enough, too,
to foresee that "The offending self slips into rumor"
[30], that anything art strategically leaves out will
have to be filled back in by some future ~Lives of The
Poets.~  He teases, in a meta- moment, at how his very
method somewhat precludes summarization into the
reductively personal:

  So all this talk adds to the idea   of the
encyclopedia
       seems to be a refraining index   never having
       localized any subject   or what personal?

[40]

but the joke he makes of that lacuna reveals a wry
attitude that's quite different from post-modernity's
righteous, anti-Humanistic conviction about its
self-censorship.  Maybe because his method was
realistic enough to anticipate (a simulacrum of) the
personal as an unavoidable accident that, willy-nilly,
always comes with language:

   To speak is to appear as a continuum,
   linking resemblances in an apparent world.

[81]}


Certainly, there is a fragile, tinkling "Handle With
Care" breakability that can be heard in the background
of ~Culture~, intermittently, the way crystal will
ring out if a singer's voice hits too high a note
("boundary of glass" [29]; "Ingenue, is this your
heart of glass?" [77]; "Occasional death, trait, hint
of glass" [95]; "Her house is made of glass and steel"
[109]), but that's what's ~good~ and artistic about
~Culture.~  It's not grounds for commitment.

All these parameters of his poetry evade the
political, because they aim to descend to meditate
upon a rumbling, unlegislatable level ~below~ the
terra firma of the body politic:

  Beneath the city, fire, and the cool tunnels
  it looked like some weird horror film

[114]

[ADDENDA]


DISTANCE

Space, while sometimes concretely inventoried in
~Culture~ as domestic space ("the bed floor curtain
window door room / what is the language of this
place?" [116]), also carries abstracted resonances of
the poetical-metaphysical Faraway, a Beyond expressed
as "distance".  It re-appears variously, a nowhere out
of Bachelard.  That distance can still be subordinated
under the domination of language ("Between ~named~
distance and the sanctuary of fable" [73], my italics)
rather than apprehended geographically, hence, a sign.
 He can be glib about it, again recapturing distance
in language, this time the language of a pun ("What a
distance a day makes" [73], playing on the Esther
Phillips disco hit lyric), while still tweaking
undertones of left-over meaning such as
(grammatological?) ~difference~.  Davidson's distance
can carry something of the exile of "stranger in a
strange land" ("Foreign, distant, the long version
spring of neutrality" [101]), and there is a
loneliness about it, a solitude agitated by the
accelerated loss of the other and the gaze ("the
instant passing of a face in the distance" [119],
although faces are not legible from a distance; "Rated
in the distance below a coming measure, a look" [79]).


Indeed, this powerful motif of distance is intricately
linked with other core preoccupations of his, that of
a pensive, philosophical-contemplative life ("the
distant home of thought" [115]) and themes of his such
as his elusive, doubling sense of repetition
("Repeated in the far distance" [96]).

The political is understood to be an arena of action,
and where it is not, inaction becomes a passivity
resulting from oppression or apathy; but this
ever-present distance in Davidson's imagination
lessens or eliminates the instances and salience of
action, not necessarily out of some lumpen impotence,
though, but out of speculative states of rest and
repose ("At distance, / more than shape or act, . . .
/ . . . offering hands in reflection and ease" [98]).

Where, rarely, architecture interposes itself to block
and interrupt the tides of that distance, it is
symbolic of impasse, estoppages ("Each of us blurs
before our own walls" [45]) that are so strong in
their definiteness that they render ~us~ indistinct,
the object betraying the subject.  It is unclear
whether those blockades have any route of passage
built into them, and even if so, if those passageways
would only anticipate their shutting ("the doors would
close   there / are no doors" [57]), stated as a
paradox.  Which may be why, earlier, he has to
jettison his body to get through such openings:
they're very narrow ("a small crack in the door"
[113]).  These doors leading through distances don't
behave as entrances or exits.  They're more a form of
hide-&-seek ("He disappears behind a door that he
enters into view" [50]).

FURTHER OBSCURE PHILOSOPHIZING: ABSORPTION

(Did Bernstein's essay "Artifice of Absorption" mean
anything to Davidson?)

That strange concept of ~repetition~ of self or others
("I am repeated") is only one of several inscrutable,
private concepts that fuel ~Culture.~  I do not mean
to portray his philosophical side as the popular
caricature of philosophizing as a cold intellectual
pursuit; Laura Riding Jackson said about herself that,
if Auden was a poet of history, she would be one of
philosophy, and Davidson, when his poetry is strong,
also meets ideas from the standpoint of the
philosopher-~poet,~ picturesquely, leaving them in
their mystery (there is a weak streak to some of his
writing, though, where the poetry drains out of his
attempt at art totally, as in the Jenny Holzer-isms in
the .pdf file). Its meaning eludes me, but another
arcane principle that his personal universe operates
on is ~absorption.~

Absorption is not an aspect of the possible or real,
though:  when the thing undergoing absorption is not
itself another abstraction, such as measurement or
time ("questions imagine its opposite   absorbing the
lengths of encounter" [53]; "stray of a quiet stare
absorbing moments" [54]), then it simply defies
reality and involves an other-than-human surrealism
("Buildings that animals absorb / penetrate anyone"
[29]).  A world of absorption would be a literally
fluid one.  In both cases, then, it is a property of
the central philosophical imagination that drives him:
absorption is a Davidsonian fantasy that is carried
out by ~thought,~ and that is carried out upon various
mannequin-like figures missing people left behind
("she approximates a statue that thinking absorbs and
/ disgorges" [58]; "Those brilliant figures track to
the left, absorbed" [98]).

Enigmatic usages of his like those may not be able to
be resolved.  He may have been a person (poet) capable
of pivoting on unknowns.

wystan. he was "appalling" in a sense, but when you study his work on the
page and think about him "in totum" I'm not so sure: but you are right that
he was melodramatic..wherther appalling is the right word...old (obvioulsy
he wasnt always that old)  Bill was actually though an extraordinary
character and quite sincere: but he died of an asthmatic attack in 1998 I
think it was. I think if you studied "Things of Iron and Things of Green"
carefully you would see that in some ways the interests of Bill and Alan
Loney coincide (the interest in printing and the visual and typography etc)
although I would say that Loney of course is major force in poetry in NZ but
in "Things of Iron.." Bill uses a mixture of rhetorc and prose and comment
centred on Hiroshima (in some ways in indirectly remds me of Ted
Berrigan)...but his poetry ranges form what is clearly "overkill": to
"direct talking and then he quotes forom people he met at Hiroshima: I would
dispute that he was appalling in the sense that a lot of "political poets"
are:  it would be like someone looking at your poetry and saying "he's
appalling, he doesnt rhyme" or "that's not poetry...its too  flat and" so
on...but the book is hard to get and if you were "exposed to Bill at the
wrong time - you were eg a much better reader than Bill ..or "better" is not
the right term, you and he were as different as chalk and cheese and I
enjoyed you reading and also Bill...but sometimes he was "too much" ...but
NOT always: his style somehow suited what he we was so passionate about:
true he was an egotist and often  "wouldnt shut up" and in  many respects
had his "down side" as we all do: but I think he also had some great
qualities: I think some people were put of of by his "cranky " personality
...but on balance I liked and respected Bill, and his passionate diatribes
against war etc. I knew him when I had lost interest in poetry and was
"into" street protesting and politics etc(about 1970) and he had a shop the
top of Mt Eden Road. he was also a friend of a friend  (Martin Leo) who
initiated the ivestigation into the release of the French terrorists by
David Lange...Many people knew Bill: a good man I feel.    Richard Taylor

 I agree, Maria. I have a hunch that Anne Waldman and Ammiel Alcalay's
recent initiative announced here and in the Poetry Project Newsletter
-Poetry Is News- has something to do with the painful political void left by
the absence of Allen Ginsberg at this particular turn in history. One, two,
three -quick- name one poet, name anybody who could provoke the kind of
public reaction to US governmentalillness the way Allen Ginsberg was able
to. Maybe if two or three hundred of us work together really hard we can get
a hundredth of the political protest leadership energy he was able to get
going off the top of his head. Sorry if this sounds quixotic, it's just the
way I feel.

wanted to draw some attention to george packer's article in ~the new

raises in my view salient points re the status of liberal hawks
(let's say) of various stripes... i think i find mself closest to the
"secularist" position, as packer has it, of folks like leon
wieseltier, probably owing in part to my mother's wwii experiences...
other categories incl. "theorist" (michael walzer), "romantic"
(christopher hitchens), "skeptic" (david rieff), and "idealist" (paul
berman)---all of which appeal to me in various ways, albeit i find
problems with each...

worth reading...

Three-Dimensional Magazine Lives Again in Two Dimensions
By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL
http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/09/arts/design/09ARTS.html

Published 10 times between 1965 and 1971, Aspen billed itself as the first
three-dimensional magazine. Most issues arrived in a notebook-size box
stuffed with articles that had been printed individually rather than
stapled together. But it was the nature of its contents that made Aspen
magazine stand out like a ski lift in a cornfield. Each issue was as likely
to hold postcards, posters and phonograph records as essays. And among the
magazine's 235 contributors were many prominent figures on the 60's
cultural landscape, including Roland Barthes, John Lennon, Marshall
McLuhan, Lou Reed and Andy Warhol.
Thirty years after Aspen ceased publication, copies of the actual magazines
are rarely found outside museum libraries and dusty flea-market bins. Now,
though, Aspen can be viewed on the Internet, where the three-dimensional
magazine has been digitally reproduced for the two-dimensional computer
screen with remarkable verve. The material was put online last month at
Ubu.com/aspen.
Aspen provided a vivid snapshot of its era. The Pop Art issue came in a
Warhol-designed soapbox. Another issue described works by denizens of the
Judson Memorial Church gallery, a mecca of early performance art in New
York. The Fluxus issue had conceptual scores by Philip Glass and Steve
Reich and a LaMonte Young recording. Deborah Wye, chief curator of prints
and illustrated books at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, said, "The
accuracy of the moment is something that hits you between the eyes when you
open one of the boxes."
Given Aspen's historical importance, one might assume that a digital
re-creation of the magazine would become the work of a museum. Instead, the
online version is a labor of love by Andrew Stafford, 48, a San Francisco
bookseller who gradually amassed a set of the magazines during the 1990's.
He wanted to share his collection.
"As an example of creative publishing, Aspen is just stunning," he said.
Mr. Stafford's project provides a primer in the pleasures and pitfalls of
putting real-world materials on the Internet. But there is no denying that
Aspen is an ideal candidate for online presentation. At a time when
magazines are routinely accompanied by compact disks with music or computer
software, it is easy to overlook how progressive Aspen was in packing its
issues with the thin plastic records called flexidiscs and, in one
instance, a reel of 8-millimeter film: a truly multimedia magazine.
Adapting the magazine for the Web's multimedia capabilities became
irresistible to Mr. Stafford. In 1999 he started digitizing some of the
magazine's printed pages. He converted the flexidisc recordings into sound
files that could be played on a computer and also asked a friend with a
movie projector to transfer a reel of short abstract films by Laszlo
Moholy-Nagy, Robert Rauschenberg and two other artists into video files.
Happily, Mr. Stafford did not stop there. He learned Web-animation
techniques so that he could create interactive versions of some exhibits.
For instance online visitors can flip through the digitized pages of
Lennon's 1969 diary, playfully created in 1968 (sample entry: "got up. went
to work. came home. watched telly"), or rotate the lines and dots on a page
of John Cage's score for "Fontana Mix."
Mr. Stafford completed his digitizing effort in 2000, just as lawsuits over
copyright violations involving online song files were reaching the courts.
He said, "I became totally intimidated by the prospect of breaking about
150 copyrights." Deterred by the amount of work that would be needed to
acquire permission to republish all the Aspen materials online, he put the
project in a drawer. Instead he created a free tutorial about Marcel
Duchamp, which he put online last August at UnderstandingDuchamp.com.
He was soon contacted by the artist's vigilant and unhappy rights
administrators. So far, he said, he is dodging their demand for several
thousand dollars. While researching the problem, he approached Kenneth
Goldsmith, a New York poet who has operated UbuWeb, an Internet-based
archive of experimental poetry and avant-garde works, since 1996. The site
is at Ubu.com.
Mr. Goldsmith volunteered to put the Aspen project on his site, which he
did last month.
Despite Mr. Stafford's experience with the Duchamp tutorial, Mr. Goldsmith
said: "Over the years I've found that people only come after you for rights
when you're making money. Since UbuWeb is completely free, nobody has ever
really bothered us about rights." He said he removes entries when living
artists complain, but that rarely happens.
"Most artists who find their stuff on UbuWeb are thrilled," he said.
Avant-garde artists rarely expect royalties. "They want an audience."
He may be right. The editors of several Aspen issues said they were pleased
that the material was available again. Jon Hendricks, who edited the
performance-art issue, said, "The idea was to get the information out
rather than to think of it as property." Nor did Jeffrey H. James,
executive director of the Cunningham Dance Foundation, object to audio
recordings of the choreographer Merce Cunningham on the Aspen site. Mr.
James said, "The educational value of having Merce's thoughts out there on
the Web outweighs our motives of ownership."
Still, Mr. Stafford worried that individual contributors would force him to
remove select entries. He said, "Losing just 10 percent of the contributors
would reduce its usefulness by at least half, so I'm hoping all will
cooperate."
The ultimate arbiter would probably be Phyllis Johnson, a former
intimate-apparel editor of Women's Wear Daily who created Aspen. But her
contributors have lost touch with her, and she could not be reached for
comment.
Ms. Wye of the Museum of Modern Art was enthusiastic about Mr. Stafford's
Web site, saying that it achieved the same goal as the original magazine:
making art available to a larger public. (The magazine's circulation was
15,000 to 20,000.) She also appreciated having the audio and video entries
online, noting that even an institution like the Modern does not always
have turntables and movie projectors around.
On the other hand, the Web site does not convey the tactile qualities of
the real magazines. "You can't imagine how beautiful these flexidiscs are
in person," Mr. Goldsmith said. "An audio file is no substitute for the
sensuality of vinyl." And Mr. Stafford's straightforward site design
encourages online visitors to go through each issue in a linear fashion,
losing the treasure-chest element.
There is one gap in Mr. Stafford's collection, the last of Aspen's 10
issues. Recently a book dealer with a complete set (asking price: $10,000)
offered to mail him color copies of its pages. Mr. Stafford said the issue
should be online by Christmas.
Mr. Stafford said he understood that he would never recover a dime from his
preservation project. Aspen magazine "was a folly," he said, "as is my Web
site, I guess."
He continued: "Aspen the magazine never made a penny, I'm sure. So Phyllis
Johnson and I share that across all these years."

the last three days were spent exploring, in amanda cook's phrase,
"worlds of affection," as jim behrle's tireless energies had arranged
for a constellation of celebrations for/of the writing/being of the
following: john wieners, fanny howe, stephen jonas and gerritt
lansing. reminiscences by old friends and new friends and devotees
(for example, jim dunn's devoted caretaking of john wienersin the
last several years --i don't mean devotees in the sense of cult
followings), readings of their work orchestrated but not micromanaged
by joe torra, bill corbett, and the aforementioned behrle, lots of
boston poets and a few out of towners notably aldon nielsen and
myself, it was a wonderful series of events with fabulously enormous
posters which all of us swarmed over to claim after the event, as
well as amazing artifacts, jonas's notebooks, earliest versions of
gerritt's heavenly tree grows downward, complete w/ jane freilicher
portrait of the young lansing w/ "bee-stung lips"...  others please
join in to fill in details.  nicole peyrafitte sang amazingly for
gerritt.  fanny h was interviewed live by bill corbett in front of a
standing room only crowd.  carol weston, a survivor of the magic
workshops w/ jonas, told us anecdotes and read dramatically from
"excercises for ear." joe torra's two daughters giggled, squealed,
squirmed, and ran around the rest of us like sappho's most junior
schoolgirls celebrating poetry with true gleeful abandon, and gave
their dad the thumbs-up when he was at the podium. brenda ijima gave
a fabbo and intricate reading of john wieners' geographies of
loneliness, and aldon read from letters jonas had sent baraka and
others, teasing us w/ knowledge of how close we had come to having
huge collected and selected works of jonas back in the days when he
was still living.  and on and on. very heartening, in these times of
fear.  three days away from mainstream news.

Gary, Jonathan Swift spoke of this problem as the satirist's dilemma. The
satirist, by destructing one web of community, makes another (or fails to make
another)-- and in doing so she's noted for her wit but detested for what it
does and how it's used. Confrontation can make one famous and lonely. gg

The Bilingual Poetry Series returns...
with a reading of Swedish poetry in translation

featuring Johannes G=F6ransson
reading the poetry of Aase Berg, Henry Parland and Gunnar Bj=F6rling...

Sunday, December 15th
3:30 pm
at the Bowery Poetry Club
308 Bowery  NY, NY  10012 (Bleecker-Houston)
212-614-0505
Admission is $5





Johannes G=F6ransson was born and grew up in Sweden, moving to the US 16 year=
s
ago. He has an MFA in poetry from University of Iowa and his poetry can be
found in recent issues of Verse, American Letters and Commentary, and
Jubilat among others. He works as a translator and a landscaper.

He'll be reading his translations of the following poets:

Aase Berg (b. 1967) is one of the most important young, Swedish poets of th=
e
moment. She has published three books of poetry: "Where the Deer Live", the
sci-fi epic "Dark Materia", and "Carry Fat." Berg is the poetry editor of
BLM, an international literary journal, and Vertigo, an underground
publisher of pornographic texts, translations of Bataille and such. She's
also a founding member of Stora Saltet ("the Great Salt"), an avant-garde
poetry group in Stockholm.

Henry Parland (1908-1930) was born in Russia, but participated the
Finland-Swedish Modernist movement in Helsinki (including Bj=F6rling) and
wrote in Swedish. He only published one book in his lifetime, the poetry
collection "The Sale of Ideals", as well as a number of significant essays.
His reputation as a major Modernist writer rests largely on the posthumous
collection of poetry ("Hamlet Would Have Put It More Beautifully") and an
unfinished novel ("Torn"). He died of scarlet fever when he was just 22.

Gunnar Bj=F6rling ( 1887-1960) is one of the most perplexing character in
Swedish literary history. Not only is his poetry so strange critics are
still grappling with the most basic issues (One prominent critic of the day
called his poetry "completely bottomless abracadabra," while another
proclaimed him a "homegrown mystic."), but he lived an unusual life,
including trying to assassinate the czar, writing a doctoral dissertation o=
n
Nietzsche, living as a gay man when it was still illegal, and having a
manuscript burn into shreds in an attack during World War II (he published
the leftovers).


Here are some sample poems...

Berg:

In the Guinea Pig Cave

There lay the guinea pigs. There lay the guinea pigs and they waited with
blood
around their mouths like my sister. There lay the guinea pigs and they
smelled
bad in the cave. There lay my sister and she swelled and ached and throbbed=
.
There lay the guinea pigs and they ached all over and their legs stuck
straight
up like beetles and they looked depraved and were blue under their eyes as
from
months of debauchery. My sister puked calmly and indifferently: it ran
slowly
out of her slack mouth without her moving a single nerve. And the cave was
warm
as teats and full of autumn leaves and beneath the soil lay the arm of a
mannequin. There lay the guinea pigs and ached and were made of dough. Ther=
e
lay
the guinea pigs beside the knives that would slice them up like loaves. And
my
sister with lips of blueberries, soil and mush. In the distance, the siren
bleated inhumanly. That is where the guinea pigs lay and waited with blood
around their mouths and contorted bodies. They waited. And I was tired in m=
y
whole stomach from meat dough and guinea pig loaf and I knew that they woul=
d
take revenge on me.


Parland:

The sale of ideals:
-- you say it has already begun
but I say:
better cut the prices.


Bjorling:

(from "Where I Know That You" Part II)

Oh, sure there are,
and every human being.

- you
and has a face.

I - and until I lie down
I - and with a word
I - that with your face.

Never did I see
as in the morning
I
you.

As before the waking
your countenance
pure-shape.

I obviously disagree with you on your aesthetic take of the Memorial space.
And I would be the last to see how the Memorial can be seen as an
"ennobling" of war. The heroic celebration of combat is in the
representational sculpture of the GI's at one edge of the Memorial - a
concession to those who insisted on the nobility of battle. I am sure my
anti-war interpretation of the space, may be viewed purely as a requiem for
the war by others.
I do agree with you that the Memorial is nation-centric. It's worth
imagining the impact if the Vietnamese war dead were similarly listed (for
example) on the opposite side of the Wall. That would be a welcome global
consciousness raiser! A former enemy composed of persons with real names.
Mairead's attention to the Project in Boston is interesting. George Evans,
the poet and Vietnam vet goes there every summer for the conference for
American and Vietnamese poets and writers who were in the War. Curbstone
Press, I believe, will publish his translations of North Vietnamese poets
this spring. Now that's an embrace.

This list is presumably inhabited by people with some expertise in using
words and I'd like some help in finding a kinder way to say 'exhibitionism.'
There is a tendency these days for people to exhibit their psychic pain on
talk shows, listservs, and in chat rooms and internet self-help groups
rather than deal with it.  In jargon this is called 'acting out' and it can
be either appropriate or inappropriate depending on, among other things,
whether it resolves the pain.  'Acting out' and 'exhibitionism' are rather
harsh terms for this but I can't come up with a kinder way.  Thoughts?
Ideas?

The William Joiner Center for the Study of War and Social Consequences does
not get nearly the attention it should. The work of the center is
remarkable. I have participated in the workshops, and I have spend the
summer learning the intricacies of the Vietnamese form, luc bat.
Participating in a workshop where American vets sit on one side of a table
and Vietnamese (VC) vets sit on the other translating each others' poems
taught me the power of poetry. Embrace puts it lightly, Stephen. The
friendships that have emerged are profound. The Joiner Center got the State
Dept to release the "Captured Documents" which totaled more then 20,000
pieces of paper. Many of the papers were love poems back to loved ones and
most were the last records of Vietnamese MIAs. Pham Tien Duat visits every
few years, and he goes through each one on microfilm. He then goes back and
visits peoples' families telling them what he's found. The work of the
Joiner Center, Kevin Bowen, and the staff cannot be over-exaggerated.

***********************************************************
(This was one of the tunes the Raging Grannies sang at an anti-war
march in Hamilton, Ontario recently.  It's sung to the tune of "If
You're Happy And You Know It, Clap Your Hands".)

If we cannot find Osama, bomb Iraq.
If the markets hurt your Mama, bomb Iraq.
If the terrorists are Saudi,
And the bank takes back your Audi,
And the TV shows are bawdy,
Bomb Iraq.

If the corporate scandals growin', bomb Iraq.
And your ties to them are showin', bomb Iraq.
If the smoking gun ain't smokin'
We don't care, and we're not jokin'.
That Saddam will soon be croakin',
Bomb Iraq.

Even if we have no allies, bomb Iraq.
>From the sand dunes to the valleys, bomb Iraq.
So to hell with the inspections;
Let's look tough for the elections,
Close your mind and take directions,
Bomb Iraq.

While the globe is slowly warming, bomb Iraq.
Yay! the clouds of war are storming, bomb Iraq.
If the ozone hole is growing,
Some things we prefer not knowing.
Though our ignorance is showing,
Bomb Iraq.

So here's one for dear old daddy, bomb Iraq,
>From his favorite little laddy, bomb Iraq.
Saying no would look like treason.
It's the Hussein hunting season.
Even if we have no reason,
Bomb Iraq.

Hello All--I know some of you are in the Cambridge/Boston area, so I
thought I'd mention that I'm giving a talk on George Oppen at Harvard on
Wednesday, December 11, 6:30, Barker Center.

SOME EXPERTISE IN USING WORDS





It's the fear of becoming a teddy bear

       or falling through a bedding tear



lately when I go to toy stores to buy coloring books

the teddy bears in a brown pile catch me eye to eye



call me over and wish me well



generally I am asked to free one or all or

help smuggle their child to a good family

presumably inhabited by people



I'd like some help finding a kinder way to say no



There is a tendency these days for me to 'buy out'

of my psychic pain rather than deal with it



thoughts? ideas? forge

over head like a dream



it can be either appropriate or inappropriate

depending on, among other things, whether it resolves the pain.



is there a fear of becoming a teddy bear

Geoffrey, I don't know if you have visited the Memorial, but the figurative
work by Frederick Hart is called "Three Solders." It's inclusion at the
periphery of Maya Lin's work was made possible by Ross Perot, and the
infamous Secretary of the Interior, James Watt. You can see the work from
four points of view on a website sponsored named, What Art Is Online
(http://www.aristos.org/whatart/vetmem.htm) a supplement to What Art Is: Th=
e
Esthetic Theory of Ayn Rand by Louis Torres and Michelle Marder Kamhi
(2000). tThe "heroics" are best brought out  in the sites various
descriptive plugs for the work:

"A trio of tired soldiers...of warriors larger than life."

"The three soldiers look like three soldiers, tired and heroic."

"Hart captured in stone something vivid, urgent, and alive."

=A0"Their true heroism lies in these bonds of loyalty,=A0
in their aloneness, and in their vulnerability."=A0=A0

"Three Soldiers" is a tribute, not to sacrifice and death,=A0
but to the living HEROISM of the Vietnam Veteran."


"Mr. Hart is a sculptor in the 'neo-traditional' mode, which means you can
tell what the sculpture is about merely by looking at it.=A0 The three
soldiers look like three soldiers, tired and heroic."
(Ben Wattenberg, The Washington Times, 08/12/1999).

It's amazing what the entire Memorial site elicits - "audience
participation" was a kind of "go" word in seventies theater (The Living
Theater being the most prominent example). I think the Memorial - in terms
of participation - continues to upstage them all!

Hey, this Collins chap ain't so bad! At least he's insightful--

"Collins, who views Ashbery as a great comic poet."  etc.


Actually, I really like Collins' poems, & am being facetious.  I saw him
read with William Matthews in NYC about 8 years ago, and he was really
dynamite.  Also, a friendly sort of word-farmer to chat with.

I notice folks such as Bowering, whom I otherwise admire, beating on
Collins w/o mercy. What gives?

Yes; what gives?

As you were,
Aaron B.



p.s.  Ashbery ain't bad either-- I appreciate his statement that criticism
can't "tell me how to write my next poem, which is basically what I'm
interested in."   Reminds me of a statement made by my current obsession,
Josh Billings -- "Thare aint no theory in brakeing a mule, only tew go at
him, with a klub in yure hand, and sum blood in yure eye, and brake him,
just as yu would split a log" (from his essay "What I Kno About Pharming").

To: Alan Sondheim <sondheim@panix.com>
Subject: Taking Our Message Further

Dear MoveOn member,

The last few days have been simply astounding.  Over 166,000 of
us have signed the letter to President Bush asking him to let
the inspections work.  Then over 14,000 of us chipped in nearly
$370,000 to support an Iraq advertising campaign, which will
kick off with a full-page copy of our letter in the New York
Times this week.

Of course, that'll just be the beginning.  The incredible
generosity with which folks have contributed to the Let the
Inspections Work media campaign allows us to stretch out in
directions that were previously out of reach.  We'll make sure
that our message is heard.

We're working with Fenton Communications to dramatically expand
our print ad campaign.  On Thursday, we'll be running our ad
nationally in USA Today.  And later this week, we'll be
co-sponsoring another New York Times ad, signed by prominent
public figures.  We can't give you details on that yet -- it's
embargoed until a press conference on Tuesday.

But we're not stopping at newspapers.  Next week, we'd like to
run ads on radio stations in Washington, DC.  And because we're
a grassroots organization, we'd like your help in coming up with
them.

Are you an aspiring playwright?  Professional ad man or woman?
Writer?  None of the above?  Take a crack at a 60-second script
for a radio ad with the "Let the Inspections Work" theme.  Post
it to our radio ads ActionForum (below) by Wednesday at 12:00 PST,
and rate what other folks have posted.  We'll scour the best ideas
from this forum when we decide what to put on the air in
Washington, DC.  It could mean airtime for your script.

You can post your ad script and rate other folks' ads at:

   http://www.actionforum.com/forum/index.html?forum_id=251

Beyond radio, here's how our campaign will shape up over the coming
week:

 * When the New York Times ad runs, we'll make a storm of phone
calls -- thousands -- which will increase its visibility and impact.

 * Later, we'll work together to write thousands of letters to the
editor, one of the most effective ways of getting free political
press.

 * On Wednesday, we're helping to launch the Keep America Safe/Win
Without War coalition, a group of major civic organizations
including the NAACP, the National Organization for Women, the
National Council of Churches, and a number of other organizations.
The coalition will publicize and organize a mainstream grassroots
opposition to the Bush plans for pre-emptive, unilateral war.

The momentum for letting the inspections work is clearly building.
Thank you for being part of what is already an amazing campaign.

Sincerely,
--Eli, Peter, Wes, Joan, and Carrie
  MoveOn.org
  December 9th, 2002

P.S. If you eagerly went out and bought a copy of the Times today,
like we did, you'll notice that our letter to President Bush ad is
not in it.  To stretch your dollars as far as possible, we saved
almost half the price of the ad by agreeing to placement within a
window of a few days this week, rather than running it today for
sure.  We'll see it in the paper within the next few days, and we'll
let you know as soon as we do.  If you'd like to see what the ad
looks like, go to our main page at http://www.moveon.org.

discontinuous extroversion is the best suggestion I've gotten so far and
oddly enough it was given to me by someone who no longer posts to the
listserv because of discontinuous extraversion.

Subject:      Why _culture_ is a political poem
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Thanks, Jeffrey, for that reading through _culture_.

There are criticisms in your reading that I’d agree with--that Dan might
have agreed with, too.

But the general charge, of the book’s other elements eclipsing the political
(or social/political?), is one I disagree with. Why we disagree with this is
simple. You didn’t once quote from "Product," the first poem in the series,
which comprises the book’s first 25 pages. Quoting from this book, it’s
almost impossible to find anything *not* politically charged:

Reception is a particular exchange, an object. This establishes, if
attended, a paradigm of packaging, a beeperless death, walking across the
room to find it. Anyway, we are clutched in the aspirations of a stranger.
[9]

There is a direct route, access being denied ... [9]

Guards are everywhere, only some have guns. [10]

It was the founder’s idea to raise substance to the level of belief. [10]
[And how might that change your reading of the word/idea "belief" as you go
through the book, with this resonating?]

Return and there’s another bag. Return and there’s another bag. Return and
there’s another bag. Return and there’s your cue, of course, humming along
with Product Control, Inc. Who would choose this would wish for death,
walking across the room to find it. What happens with those with too much to
remove? How many feet are needed to turn for two? For sleep? Generic
americana, faux faux. This is playing a game, a cavalcade of description,
cleaning all. [10]

Mother holds the item that was made by what was bought. [11]

Every box is a plan of attack, or you, it, advancing. [12]

Entering is participation, identity, multiply unique, restricted to what
replays, recalls, aligns, within the silence that tells about feeding it.
[13]

The intent is to create an armed camp or ritual site, never far from the tv
or sporty look. [14]

See the differences ... at all locations. [16]

You may know where dreams come true ... rewards such as a wealth of
worldwide travel and database records, a personal sense of luxury,
brilliant, and with a sense of style. [17] [And how might that complicate
the "dream" stuff later?]

Human resources ... more studies will be done. [17]

Refreshingly modern, in the American tradition, and with computer science to
increase you, a deal is a deal is a deal. [18]

Experts have a ticket. See them, touch them, touch them now. [19]

Exudes an aura revolutions are intended to address. [20]

Blend in, stand out, in the fragrant melding of trust, warmth and comfort, a
fabrication  learning to collect. This, then, is shopping from the inside.
[21]

And so on. "Shopping from the inside" being, I think, really what’s being
looked at--how this stuff is internalized.

My sense is, if you read "Product," there’s no question that this is what
we’d call "political poetry." Rather than the later stuff eclipsing this
first piece, I think this first piece resonates throughout the book. There’s
a reason Dan put it at the beginning. Everything is meant to radiate out
from it.

My analogy would be the film "The Deer Hunter," the first 25 minutes or so
taken up with a lengthy wedding/reception. The director at first thought it
was too much and wanted to cut it. But when he did, he noticed that much of
one's connection with the characters was stripped from the film. The first
25 minutes were crucial, radiated throughout the rest of the film.
Similarly, "Product," the first 25 pages of _culture_, informs and even
warps everything that comes later.

When the SPD catalog says that _culture_ was a "poetical critique of
productivised social relations"--I don’t think that’s "false advertising." I
think, reading the book, it’s obvious. So that, "dreams" and "belief," which
you pick up on, would not, after reading "Product," be taken quite at the
*face value* level you’ve taken them in your critique. They’re warped I
think by their earliest instances. By this sense of "productivised social
relations."

* * *

It may be that, because "Product" is the poem I talked about Dan’s use of
"Breakdown" in, you avoid it ("I can always read a gas meter," I think you
said.) Remember, though, how actually Dan wrote that poem. He sat, day after
day, in department stores in San Francisco, jotting down notes. It was his
own writing he sent through the Breakdown program. And, as I also say in the
afterword, the poem was created by reworking what the program had spewed
out. So, the charge of "non-authorial" here, I think is not accurate. He
worked on it for quite a while, and the beginning and ending acts in the
process were what we would call "authorial." (e.g., "intended.")

His use of mediation here, of the "Breakdown" program, was a poetic nod, I
think, to the "factory." It is, after all, the "Product" that he’s looking
at.

I feel on the one hand grateful for all of the work you’ve put into reading
the book. On the other hand, I feel like you’ve missed the point by
selectively ignoring the piece from which everything else is made manifest.
Like having a discussion about a punchline without taking into account the
rest of the joke. Or something.

Is that fair? Anyway, thanks for reading through it again. I do wonder,
though, how "Product," if you don't ignore it, might (or might not) change
your reading of the rest of the book ...

Yeah,Richard,it WAS a long time ago and I WAS another person. I can't
remember the poetry very well; but the title 'Jesus Christ was a Black Man'
sounds no more promising now than it did to me then. You speak of his
interest in the visual, typography etc. I recall that style of collage you
find in school projects and American artists' books of the 70s,  messy,
expressive, garish etc. One-of-a-kind (fortunately) they called them.  That
said, I could easily be doing the man an injustice.
Excuse me.

wystan. he was "appalling" in a sense, but when you study his work on the
page and think about him "in totum" I'm not so sure: but you are right that
he was melodramatic..wherther appalling is the right word...old (obvioulsy
he wasnt always that old)  Bill was actually though an extraordinary
character and quite sincere: but he died of an asthmatic attack in 1998 I
think it was. I think if you studied "Things of Iron and Things of Green"
carefully you would see that in some ways the interests of Bill and Alan
Loney coincide (the interest in printing and the visual and typography etc)
although I would say that Loney of course is major force in poetry in NZ but
in "Things of Iron.." Bill uses a mixture of rhetorc and prose and comment
centred on Hiroshima (in some ways in indirectly remds me of Ted
Berrigan)...but his poetry ranges form what is clearly "overkill": to
"direct talking and then he quotes forom people he met at Hiroshima: I would
dispute that he was appalling in the sense that a lot of "political poets"
are:  it would be like someone looking at your poetry and saying "he's
appalling, he doesnt rhyme" or "that's not poetry...its too  flat and" so
on...but the book is hard to get and if you were "exposed to Bill at the
wrong time - you were eg a much better reader than Bill ..or "better" is not
the right term, you and he were as different as chalk and cheese and I
enjoyed you reading and also Bill...but sometimes he was "too much" ...but
NOT always: his style somehow suited what he we was so passionate about:
true he was an egotist and often  "wouldnt shut up" and in  many respects
had his "down side" as we all do: but I think he also had some great
qualities: I think some people were put of of by his "cranky " personality
...but on balance I liked and respected Bill, and his passionate diatribes
against war etc. I knew him when I had lost interest in poetry and was
"into" street protesting and politics etc(about 1970) and he had a shop the
top of Mt Eden Road. he was also a friend of a friend  (Martin Leo) who
initiated the ivestigation into the release of the French terrorists by
David Lange...Many people knew Bill: a good man I feel.    Richard Taylor

Ron,

You praise Moxley for not having a postmodern "wink."   I don't want to try
to deconstruct this--fearing I will be crushed by my betters--but can you
elaborate on this wink, explain what it looks like?  I think people tend to
assume they know what one another mean by the wink of postmodern irony, let
alone postmodern irony itself.  But what do *you* mean?

Like, who does it?   Does Ashbery?  Koch? Certainly: Tate?  So is it a New
York School thing?  Or just a New York thing?  But how about:  Wallace
Stevens?  Is there a *modern* wink of irony?   Do you think Rachel Loden
winks when she speaks about Nixon?  How about Susan Schultz?   I know
Robert Bly hates the wink; he sees right through it.  Some people just want
to be honest, not to fuck around.  i can sympathize with that.

But I find myself rummaging through all my loose poems, which are flying
around my desk now in a maelstrom, as I wonder if any -- perhaps all? --
my poems have the dreaded wink.  I feel like Poe with the yellow eye
looking through the keyhole, the heart beating under the floorboard.  I
also feel like Bugs Bunny, when he gets so dreadfully sleepy, propping his
eyelids open with toothpicks.    ~~I don't want to wink.~~  The Book of
Proverbs condemns those that "winketh with their eyes, speaketh with their
feet, teacheth with their fingers."   Now that you are pleased to see less
winking, too, I think that settles the matter for me.

Earnestly,
if a bit Anxiously,

Aaron S. Belz

from Ron S's Blog

"Monday, December 09, 2002 =A0
The title piece of Jennifer Moxley=B9s extraordinary The Sense Record is an
astonishing poem =AD astonishing because it dares to go where virtually no
post-avant writing has gone in a generation. This is the first stanza:
=A0
Under the threat of another light downpour
Eros, soaked by the rain-water,
spoke to the sentient flowers.
Sadness, no longer extraneous,
began the derangement of nerve,
bypassed the bleeding heart
to pierce the blood-brain barrier.
This all en route to the two-car garage.
I was worn with the labor that augurs despair,
life in the futile percentile, when past
my squeamish eyelash, buffeted by scallops
of small will, the slightest fairy brushed.
My rubber soles conformed to the stones
as I followed and spied the backyard starlet
allong=E9e on an orange blossom, delicate
beside the drinking bees, blithe amidst
sharp blades of grass, a rain-drop seductress
entertaining ants on the folding lip
of a pinkster leaf."

Oh postmodern irony, where is thy wink? It=B9s not to be found anywhere in
this poem=B9s eleven pages. Largely bracketed between two quotations from
Verlaine, =B3The Sense Record=B2 presents the grimmest view of contemporary
alternatives we have had since perhaps William Bronk. I don=B9t normally thin=
k
of Moxley in that context =AD she is so much more the stylist that one can
slide easily into the elegance of her forms & almost luxuriate at that leve=
l
alone."=20
!!!!
Ron, I think you got pulled into the wax. To my ear/memory/reading 19th
Century Shelley/Wordsworth/Coleridge (somewhere in the mix) is an almost
funny mock (Moxley!) epic lyric trip to the garage. It does go drip and
drip. Ironic, yeah, I think so. A not so veiled sense (wink) of exhaustion
with prior facility w/PM Irony, I can't totally say. But the intention to
irritate and be irritated seems clear. I have no idea if Moxley or the poem
is headed into 50's pill popping Boston stereotypical housewife darkness -
but perhaps more an anxious slap in the face to that option, as well.
Astonishing, I don't think so. Interesting because disturbed and disturbing=
,
some.

wystan  this arose becuase someone mentioned Little Richard ...not as a
question of Bill Millett's poetical capacities or his typographical style
...I think that side of things is more complex than you response indicates:

It IS a fact though that somehow - for whatever reason - the guy was
interesting to me..maybe because of his passion against Hiroshima and war:
but in fact I wasnt wanting to hear overtly political poems at the time he
was rading  eg about 1987 (he may have read earlier I wasnt "in the scene"
then) so initially his poetry as such didnt interst me: my interest in Bill
is/was through other contacts and associations. I came to have a respect for
Willliam Millett: a counter example is Michael Morrisey who is clearly
talented but I  simply abhore the man - well, I dont hold grudges so maybe I
dont so much these days....he's has mellowed a bit....but he's was always an
arrogant careeerist and a womaniser (in a really pathetic sense)....

But In contrast to Loney -who is defointely a considerabley talented poet:
Bill at least was "out there" whereas I think Loney is a semi-nutcase (myabe
Bill was too) with an inferiority complex because he had no certificates etc
lately he's behaving like a child because of what's happnened to Brief: but
his concepts were becoming too elitist...Bill at least felt...maybe he was
a bombast and possiblty a bit or nearly a hypocrite: but I think that he was
genuine.

The Alan Loney of his most recent book - adn some of his beter other work -
("Falling" ) is clearly a very impressive writer - and from one perspective
Bill Millett doesnt compare...but then , who'se to really know? Opinions
change frequently about the relative merits of writers: I feel that part of
Bill's strength (he had a lot of tedious sides I agree) was the "cranky
Yank" side....he was at least open and strong in his beliefs: wheras a lot
of the Aporists etc are very vague about what they believe, you wonder they
dont dissolve to fish jelly ....but I diverge:

as I say I was initially only interested in him from a human-biographical
point of view.  "Jesus Christ Was a Black Man" is strange in its obsession
with the subject and I tend to feel that it is for me mainly a curiosity as
book....as I have a bit of colector's bug: hence my "valuing" also  "Things
of Iron, Things of Green" which as a book is as good as any thing done or
better bby Alan Loney - I had a printer make a special trip to get another
copy I had - I value it for the humanity and the art and its uniqueness.
Actually to some extent  - in fact it is - a cooperativee effort as the
intro says..and as to art etc y gfather was anartist so i have an "eye'a
sicould paibnt water colours when i was nine easily (ihave never forgotten )
so I have a sense for these things which complex intellectualising will
miss - always.

fear

the pagoda remains upright because of pendulum force from
the top, not the bottom.
interior of the vagina and mouth in infra-red and vocal cords.
construction workers and foremen ordering me away from the site
because of the potential for future terrorist attacks.
embodying a philosophical attitude which refuses to give in
to tradition or authority but cut and ground to a keen edge.
Nikuko watches over me. Nikuko: You've got to stop this worry.
Alan: But there's no time left. I'm close to the end of my life.
Nikuko: There is no death. Nothing is alive, nothing is dead.
Alan: That's easy for you to say. Nikuko: We are all avatars.
I can feel these wires as strongly as you can.
Alan: I can't sing. Nikuko: You are neither pagoda nor opening.
You close everything off. You are afraid of terror.
Alan: I am terror-stricken. I am afraid of philosophy. At night
I dream of torture. I respond with imaginary conversation.
Nikuko: I usurp the imaginary. I watch over you. We are humans
of the last days. There is no turning back. We are moving into
mind. Alan: I want my mind to remain. I care little about
the body. Nikuko: Which mind; mine or yours. Which hour
of which mind. Which day; which week; which year; decade.
Alan: I do not care for time. Nikuko: Care for mind. Transfer
this mind.
the hand swerves with the swerve of the brush. the character
speaks itself through the hand. meaning is an afterthought
of the human just as the brush is the foreground of the mind.
Nikuko: Jennifer I want to play with you. Jennifer: Alan,
Nikuko pushed me in the puddles and my panties are all wet.
Nikuko: Jennifer return to me. Jennifer: Alan, Nikuko is
holding my mind against my breasts.
her mind balloons against her body. her mind spreads across
her chest and throat. her voice rises through her mind.
Nikuko: transfer this.

This will no doubt sound self-promoting but COMBO 11 will be out this
Friday and I would strongly encourage anyone interested in this Moxley
thread to read K. Silem Mohammad's 6 page review Moxley's The Sense
Record.  Mohammad is the perfect person to illuminate these poems, thweir
methodologies and motivations and I think, among other things, he sheds
light on why too smart readers like Ron and Stephen would have the
difference of opinion expressed below.  Anyway, I think many on this list
already subscribe and can expect their copy in about 10 days to 2 weeks
but if not copies are $3, 4-issue subscriptions $10.  Best bargain in the
biz.    -m.

Has anybody here ever read Bruce Andrews' dissertation book?
If so, would it be a mis-characterization of it to claim that the main
argument,
or thesis, of this book is that the anti-war protests had little, or nothing,
to do
with the eventual cessation of that war by the U.S. Gov't.?

i agree with maria, but i would keep the term "bad poetry," not because =
what
we're talking about is bad, whatever that is, but because there are times
when the BAD is useful and appropriate; so, like "bad history," "bad
poetry"  bad, man

we mentioned this option in our initial call for poems for the Rust Talks
anti-war reading

by the way, Jeffrey, to answer your request for a report: we will =
eventually
publish the poems from the reading on our Rust Talks website
http://epc.buffalo.edu/ezines/rust      it may take us some time, however, as
our so-called web-master has abandoned us for warmer climes

hopefully, it'll come out before the war is over (that's the real issue, =
no?
- as Nick Lawrence pointed out in our discussion after the reading: how =
does
one develop and maintain an anti-war movement when (in this case) the
upcoming war against Iraq may last no longer than a couple months or =
less?-
does anyone remember Afghanistan? sorry, that was last year

"The names of the countries can change, once a week, once
        a month,
the rate can change, the male newsperson looks concerned
but truly neutral, his mouth the epicenter
of objectivity, the great good place, saying simply
the army was stepping in,
no figures on casualties are available
because there's not enough causality outside the studio to go
        around.
Turning to traffic on Route 80 it looks like
the spectre of abstraction has finally been made real."

--Bob Perelman, from "Back To The Present" (Face Value)

Bob Perelman's work from the mid-to-late 80s, in particular To The Reader,
First World, and Face Value,  in my mind offers another possibility in =
terms
of anti-war poetry (in a more comprehensive sense: the work dealing less
with war per se than with the ideology that makes war central to its
policy) perhaps this is what Jeffrey meant by work that focuses on media
representation: "is it political to say 'This is what I read in the
newspaper?'" i say yes; such material may no longer surprise most of us =
who
read poetry-as if that's the only function poetry has: morning =
freshness-but
the analysis performed above is as relevant as ever, especially in light =
of
speedy wars and instant amnesia

last spring i screened the documentary The Panama Deception to my comp
class; seeing the same "operatives" that are in office today spouting the
same lines, with the media dutifully in tow-focusing exclusively on =
military
strategy rather than on the ethics of intervention/invasion; fuzzy math on
the casualties (collateral damage); mad ave logos (Just Cause, which i
always read as "just because"); etc-truly shocked my students           "Back To =
The
Present" (1988) can have a similar effect insofar as it documents a =
pattern,
and so, in that sense, yes, deconstructing all the news fit to print is
political

this is what Geoffrey was speaking to, i think, when he expressed relief
that the anti-war reading was bongo-free: the skewed media image of the =
60s
continues to mediate most forms of resistance   remember Thomas Friedman's
arrogant dismissal of anti-globalization demonstrators in Seattle as a =
flock
of unsophisticated granola heads                this is the image many people have of =
the
anti-war movement and i think it is something we must deal with         so what's
the answer? dress up  in suit & tie? (just make sure you leave the =
briefcase
behind, as you might otherwise get shot)

Because it is an American flag, a worn Newspoetry must be burned.

On January 1st, 2003, www.newspoetry.com will stop offering a poem a day
about events in the news and will take its final form as an online book,
documenting four years of daily newspoems and the turn of the American
millennium.

        Newspoetry Personality Inventory

Answer the following questions true or false. The results will help us
determine whether you are a newspoet.

1.      My daily life is full of things that keep me interested.
2.      There are many beautiful words that do not contain the letter E.
3.      The government is reading my poetry.
4.      I often find that the internet makes me nervous.
5.      Chomsky has a point.
6.      The New York Times tells little white lies.
7.      I have written poetry and have not been concerned about whether it was publishable.
8.      I see news around me that other people do not see.
9.      Sometimes I read a newspaper and don't notice any facts.
10.     I think I would like the work of a typewriter.
11.     A nuclear war could have undesirable consequences.
12.     I sometimes wonder what anybody could possibly mean by "evil."
13.     I seldom worry about North Korea.
14.     I like to go to protests and other affairs where there is lots of loud fun.
15.     Sometimes in elections I vote for people I don't think will win.
16.     I wish I were not bothered by thoughts about international trade agreements.
17.     I think I would like to be a folksinger.
18.     Cluster bombs make me uncomfortable.
19.     Ginsberg has a point.
20.     People should try to understand the newspaper and be guided or take warning from it.
21.     Politicians often disappoint me.
22.     I have often read statements by people who were supposed to be experts who were no better than I.
23.     Once in a while I read things too bad to write about.
24.     I think I would like the kind of work riot troops do.
25.     I am almost never physically sickened by the news.
26.     I wish I could be as happy as the people in People Magazine seem to be.
27.     At times I understand so well it bothers me.
28.     I love my president, or (if the president is impeached) I loved my president.
29.     Some days I don't find it hard not to give up hope.
30.     I breathe almost every day.
31.     Most people will use somewhat unfair means to gain profit rather than to lose it.

*******ANNOUNCING THE PUBLICATION OF _V. IMP._ BY NADA GORDON*******

Don't miss this *important* new book by one of the most *important*
writers of our time.

Mood-riddled hijinx and impudent lyric protest, drama, and parody
from the author of Swoon, Foriegnn Bodie, and Are Not Our Losing
Heifers Sleeker than Night-Swollen Mushrooms? Puzzlement,
buffoonerie, fury, and wistfulness ring out among v. imp.'s
cacophonous panoply of tones:  "Some days my idiolect just betrays
me/ as the hmm kind of interesting phoenix of gyroscopic angst."


Nonsense galore, as in a bathhouse.

                                --Viktor Shklovsky


[T]his book is a mystery, a mere chimera: it has a lovely woman's
face with the feet and tail of a serpent or of some more hideous
animal.  It is a monstrous jumble of delicate and ingenious morality
and of filthy depravation.  Where it is bad, it excels by far the
worst, and is fit only to delight the rabble; and when it is good, it
is exquisite and excellent, and may entertain the most delicate.

Subject:      Bruce Andrews' Vietnam

re:

Has anybody here ever read Bruce Andrews' dissertation book?
If so, would it be a mis-characterization of it to claim that the main
argument,
or thesis, of this book is that the anti-war protests had little, or nothing,
to do
with the eventual cessation of that war by the U.S. Gov't.?

Chris

***

I'm actually publishing a to-be-titled .pdf of Bruce's collected political
writings on Arras soon, kind of like the one I did for Steve Evans Notes to
Poetry.  I have all of the corrected manuscripts from BA, just waiting for a
free week or to to format it, get an intro, etc.  It's a lot of material, a
bit dry here and there but he does manage to incorporate his poetry into some
of these essays -- I don't have any paper appears as intertitles in one
conference essay.

I haven't read his dissertation unless it is the pamphlet called "Public
Constraint and American Policy in Vietnam", but that was published in 1976
when he was already at Fordham.  I've only read parts of this book but it had
little to do with the protests directly and more to do with how the war was
being portrayed in the left and right-wing political organs of the time.  The
idea is that war policy may have been more guided by domestic concerns than
global concerns about security, that the state was a "social actor" in
determining what these domestic concerns were, etc., which seems to be one of
the main theses of BA's poli-sci writings in general (another essay is titled
"Social Rules and the State as a Social Actor").

I wouldn't be surprised if he did in fact contend that the protests had little
to do with the cessation of war -- I'm not too sure they did either, but I'm
not a scholar on the era.  It seems to me that the protests started years
before the war ended, and so even if they were effective they were probably
only indirectly so.

Aaron Belz Writes:

<Hey, this Collins chap ain't so bad! >snip< I notice folks such as
Bowering, whom I otherwise admire, beating on Collins w/o mercy.
What gives?>

And asks of Ron Silliman:

<You praise Moxley for not having a postmodern "wink."   I don't want
to try to deconstruct this--fearing I will be crushed by my
betters--but can you elaborate on this wink, explain what it looks
like?>

I Add Two Cents:

Aaron, I put these two bits together because I think they inform each other.
(At least in my imagination.) Billy Collins, I believe, is wrong. Which is, I
don't agree with where his art goes. Which is, I don't think the world that his
poetry describes is the world in which I live. So I don't much care for his
poetry. It rings false to my experience. As much as it feels smooth, or
thoughtful, I don't trust it.

I think Collins' poetry inhabits the mode of postmodern irony, but without
recourse to the wink. To me, then, his poetry mostly seems unhelpfully one
thing . . . what was that Einstein quote someone tossed into the mix some
time back. . . things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler? . . . I
think Collins' work goes simpler. I'm not saying it's simplistic, just simpler
than my understanding of the world needs it to be.

Which leads me to the WINK. I think this postmodern wink--as much as I
figure--is a necessary courtyard of emotion. A place where interesting,
necessary things might be found. It's not the only courtyard, though. So if a
poet only inhabits the wink, then, as well as in Collins' work, they've failed
the totality of the IS.

So that's what I think anyway, this plurality of afternoon.

Best,
  John Gallaher

I am really interested in Silliman's thoughts, and in
John and Aaron's conversation about the wink, but feel
a bit too grading-addled at the moment to say much of
interest or use.  Nonetheless, I do want to say that I
think the "wink" is about intent, and about heart, and
about insecurity.  I think the wink happens when a
poet is using humor, postmodern referencing, high/low
culture intermixing, etc., for the sake of AVOIDING a
question, or trying to ENGAGE with the reader on that
level, on the "aren't we so clever?" level, rather
than the same humor or the same pomo reference coming
from a place of utter sincerity or trying to get to
something really honest.  As John said, it's about
trust--do you trust the poet and what they are saying?

So I actually think Tate, whom Aaron called "surely a
winking poet" or something like that, as not winking
at all--to me his work seems utterly without guile,
even while it is full of play and wit and absurdity.
It strikes me as very real in its intent.  I can't
totally tell you why right now.  As they say, she
knows it when she sees it...

I also know that in my own work (and I think here of
other poets I consider my kindred spirits on the list,
like J. Gallaher and Aaron and also Gabe Gudding and
many others) I walk a fine line between winking and
restraining from the wink.  Sometimes the winks can be
fun, but the poems that resist winking are often much
better, and can be just as pleasurable (or more so,
because they feel more lasting and less
self-involved).
Back to grading,
Arielle

I agree with you Arielle, but I disagree with Ron's labeling of Jennifer
Moxley as "post avant." If anything I find The Sense Record to be PRE-avant
-- meaning that the work comes right out of the moderns. And, Moxley does
wink in The Sense Record. However, her wink is not a pomo wink of irony but
a wink towards the moderns, and the Objectivists in particular. I think Ron
only goes so far in his analysis of Moxley when he says that she lacks the
ironic wink. She does so because she's not going for that gag. That ain't
her schtick in The Sense Record. The book hits a vein the pulses in between
the moderns and the pomos/post-avants.

I should also say that I have my own review of
Moxley's book forthcoming in the new Rain Taxi.  I
talk about her relationship to other "post" poets and
also coin a new term--"the ultraline"--to talk about a
 kind of backlash to the fragment I'm seeing in her
work and elsewhere.

Well, I have no grading to do, but I'm plenty busy with other little
things so I'm only posting back to say this, quickly:

The absurd wink . The ironic wink . The self-consciously clever wink .
The Yes, But wink . The As If wink . The Wink at the Fourth Wall .

What was the intent of the Bruce Willis wink to the absent fourth wall
in "Moonlighting"? Compared, for that matter, to the wink of George
Burns at the absent fourth wall on, what was it called again, "Burns &
Allen"? Or "The Burns & Allen Show"?

Winking at the artifice? Cannot that very move be the move toward
heart? So, yes, humor, as when Arielle writes:

<I think the wink happens when a poet is using humor, postmodern
referencing, high/low culture intermixing, etc., for the sake of
AVOIDING a question, or trying to ENGAGE with the reader on
that level, on the "aren't we so clever?" level, rather than the same
humor or the same pomo reference coming from a place of utter
sincerity or trying to get to something really honest.>

And this can be what happens with the WINK. The, I guess, BAD
wink. But what of the good wink? (Not the hood wink.)

To disavow the suspension of disbelief. To unsay it in the act of
saying it, is still saying, is still having said. Who might be examples of
this? Might this be Tate (on a good day)? Or Ashbery? At least this is
how I read Ashbery. Perhaps how I read Armantrout at times. Or
Michael Palmer. Even Silliman, and others . . . there is a wink in Tate,
I'm sure of it, the lyric would seem to call for it, and maybe it can be a
wink without guile. A wink of inclusion, perhaps. Eh, maybe. Maybe
not, I guess. I'll think about it more.

Pleasurably,
  JG

Is it a wink
when one says something
and it seems "poetic"
and then one realizes that it might, to others,
seem "ironic"
or "post" something,

The word "irony," often implying a non-sincere tone,
an attitude toward the LETTER
(if not necessarily the spirit)
of poetry
(what poetry's "suppossed to be"
either because of some sense of "fashion"
or some sense of "tradition"),
may sometimes be used to "legitimize"
an attitude towards poetry
that may really be a non-pejorative "laziness"
or "ignorance" of taboo-making fashions
and the "need" for a single TM style

like if one were to say
"rabbits are crepuscular"
or:

Our very 'language' runs the table--
you can struggle to snuggle
but not snuggle to struggle

and feel as poetic to oneself
as when one is exploring
the same spiritual matters
in more 'serious' death or taxes ways

(but not to others....)

("i'm just clearing away the guck...")

like liking to wear tight jeans
because they feel good
even if it won't make people want to go to bed with you
or even if they're very hard to find these days in stores
and trying to conserve the ones you bought years ago

*hell, even with holes in them, they're still more
comfortable than the baggy 'straightleg' ones they sell these days*

which means you won't go out feeling so comfortable to work
until you can either make enough to afford a privitized tailor
or figure out how to make your own clothes
which seems like an awful waste of time
so maybe conserve even more and stay in where you can be naked
though surely even that will be called ironic
by the 'otherworldly' writers on this month's masthead
no worse than the 'worldly' ones, really.....

In other news,
Today's one high thought that hasn't "gotten off the ground" as of yet

"She thought that by building a monument to representation itself,
  it would free things and thoughts. From what?

(insert Carlin joke here....)

Yea Verily, none of those folks you mention JG would be considered poets
were not Michael Moore and Alan Watts considered poets

sincerely
praying
for an end to
"post op"
mouth pain,

until the spring.

Sherman Alexie is, for health reasons, unable to travel to New York City.
His situation is NOT life-threatening nor is there any permanent disability
involved. He will return to action soon.

We're sorry for any inconvenience to you that has resulted from this
postponement. We were only notified of Sherman's condition this afternoon.

Chris,

That was clarifying.  Rabbits are a major theme of poetry that winks.
Stevens: "when nothing is left but the light on your fur" etc.

I'm still not sure what Ron meant by "wink of postmodern irony," but after
reading these posts and thinking about the matter, I've decided I *like*
postmodern irony. What I mean by irony is the certain sardonic tension
between what is said and what is meant. In my family they call it
"dryness" -- dad has it, uncle so-and-so is particularly dry; these are
Iowa farm boys.  They say one thing, mean another, and everybody laughs.
Kind of a Bob and Ray version of William Stafford.  But it's not just about
family:  I think irony is pretty much the heart of literature through the
ages, and if our particular period is given to irony, then maybe it's given
to literature.  The created, spoken, printed, emailed, coughed, inhaled,
and listened-to *word*.  The canwehaveourballback kind of language. Let it
flow!

If what is meant by "wink of postmodern irony" is somewhat along the lines
of Arielle's negative definition of "winking",   I agree, it's lazy.  But
that's not "irony" -- it's bad poetry. Bad writing. Kind of weak, escapist,
hyperreferential trash.  Kind of the old boy's network "I know something &
you don't" country club thing, but in educated, cosmopolitan poetry.

However, I'd rather err on the side of irony than on the side of
super-serious cause-poetry.  I'd rather have a sense of humor.

Ha ha ha !  Isn't this funny?

Kind of,
Aaron

Well, then, I guess what you're saying is--- "If you
don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding / How
can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?"
(Pink Floyd's "The Wall")

Funny you should say that: I just sent a manuscript
off to an open call for submissions, and the opening
poem in the book, "Sound Effects," begins:


    A man goes into a bar.  There's a dog
    standing on its hind legs behind the bar,
    polishing shotglasses on an apron it wears.

    Elected officials should stop leaking news items
    to the press if they're unwilling to face
    spuming branding irons poised to set fire
    to their front gates, stamping searing ensignias
    into bleached acacia wood.  . . .


The opening lines (tercet) are borrowed from the
beginning of numerous commonly told jokes (leading
into a sort of illustrated cocktail napkin cartoon,
and then veering off elsewhere [into--- the
political?!]) without bothering ever to return to or
even consider the ~possibility~ of a punch line.

So, on some level, yeah, I ~am~ all too willing to
discuss punchlines without taking into account the
rest of the joke.  And vice-versa.  (…Although I think
your metaphor is sort of flipflopped,
proportionately.) I read a book about Aesop's fables
which assessed which ones might actually have been the
"original" fables and which were the imitative genre
that came after it, and the book totally excluded any
consideration of the ~morals~ that are tagged on at
the end.  --- Famously, in Biblical studies, there's
the "shorter version" of The Gospel According to St.
Mark, too: it leaves out the final chapter about the
Resurrection.


The problem you're attaching to my reading (which,
granted, may indeed be a serious, preposterous
problem) is that, by leaving out the first 25 out of
119 pages ("Product" is actually only 17 pages), the
83% of the book that I did read somehow doesn't count
or cannot stand on its own footing, without that
remaining 1/5th of the book.  But then, what you're
proposing is an aesthetic of the unitary, of the
artwork as an indivisible totality, ---no?--- where
~Culture~ can only be approched in its wholeness and
intact completeness (really, that "Product" is the
filter that the remaining poetry cannot be approached
without, the skeleton key),

--- but that only puts Davidson completely out of step
with the mentality of the '90s  and why he would have
used "Breakdown" software in the first place (to
deregulate the primacy or necessity of order [whereas
order is the very thing you're defending!  You're
reinstating an unimpeachable global syntax to
over-arch the book, whereas he took pains to
disempower syntax at every turn]).  Is that ~really~
the compositional principle of Davidson's that you
want to fault me for having failed to respect: his
*linearity*??


Before a deck of cards is dealt, it's shuffled, and
then it can be "cut," dividing it in half and moving
the second stack in front of the first.  That's about
how much of "a reason Dan put it at the beginning"
survives, after "Breakdown," I'd say.



There is an important underlying difference, though,
between my hermeneutic and your reply's (despite that
yours superficially resembles or copies mine:
list-like "evidence", etc).   I did organize my
"findings" according to their general types and tried
to extract a portraiture that accounts for and
harmonizes what emerged,--- but the sort of
thematic-motivic analysis that I followed proceeded
~inductively,~ by delineating first ~what's there,~
without preconceptions, and letting the diction that
Davidson himself chose to operate as motifs be shown
as such.

These words, "world," "dream," etc., are what ~he~
reasserted, over and over.  I only come in as an
observer trying to interpret the ~objective~ content
that results from his refrains.  In some cases
("absorption", "repeat"), I don't even know how to
~name~ what he's doing or saying, it's so abstruse;
but I am at least having the honesty to argue that
it's a disservice to his artistry to leave all that
out of the picture.  If the first 1/5th of the book or
any part of it is political, that political side has
to be ~reconciled~ to these other dimensions, without
just brushing them into oblivion or missing them
entirely.

But your reply moves from the a priori conclusion,
that he is in fact political, and then searches out
documentation that would substantiate that prejudice.



And the kind of politics that you want to pin on him
is a prefabricated doctrinaire position that's as
cliché as "productivised social relations".  If that's
true, then it was politically very unimaginative of
him.  (As if card-carrying Party member artists were
to crib their poetry off of the small print and
instructions on the back of the card.)  "Productivised
social relations" sounds like exactly the sort of
empty jargon he was attacking (?) and problematizing
in his long series of Jenny Holzer Truism-isms, in the
.pdf's poem "An Account".  ---There: "Anything not
used in the creation of profit is automatically
suspected of being subversive" [.pdf p. 14]; and the
transgression in my omission of "Product" is that I've
left something ~"not used"!~

The dilemma here may be: was Davidson as politically
simplistic and exaggerated as the occasional political
passages in his poetry would make him seem ("Product
Control, Inc."???) and therefore writing political
poetry (and maybe just bad at it),

or,

is there a poet there who is good enough, ---a genuine
"masterpiece," as Friedlander blurbed,--- that he
should be defended from his own ambiguity by insisting
that it ~was~ ambiguous and not the agitprop that it
resembles?

You're taking his "politicalese" (like the
"bureaucratese" he mentions) very literally.


Meanwhile, take a closer look at the Iraqi buttons.
(Afterword by Gary Sullivan: "During the Gulf War Dan
made up a batch of pins that read 'Iraqi.'  The idea
was that you'd wear them in public --- which I don't
think he convinced many of his friends to do, although
he certainly wore one himself. . . . Benjamin
Friedlander recalls telling Dan he'd wear one if it
read 'Arab' or 'Arabic'---Ben felt that if Dan's point
was to humanize the 'enemy' it would be more accurate
to refer to them as people (Arabs) as opposed to a
government (Iraq).") They can stand in as a model
here.

What the Iraqi buttons were doing was taking the
immediately and topically political, today's headline,
and then  ~swapping and mismatching~ its signifiers so
that the political is exposed as a way of
~mislabeling~ and misidentifying everything.  Davidson
was, essentially, treating politics as though it were
a giant form of "Breakdown", scrambling the
signification and syntax of ~people's place~ within
the political order (Americans wearing "Iraqi" buttons
were ~not~ Iraqis, so the political signifier is as
arbitrary and spurious as any).

Your Afterword brings out how he made poetry out of
specifically assembled collections of books and
"source material", by genre, that included hordes of
art and culture theory discourse, mass media, and
women's beauty magazines.   I don't know why, with his
treating discourses as virtually interchangeable
anthropological fodder, you then make an exception and
see ~Culture~ as having retained ~one~ sole precious
discourse that he would not sully with irony or
alienation, a political discourse that must be the
~"real"~ herz-sprach of Daniel Davidson.


In which case, the second half of the dilemma, what I
would prefer: the critique in Davidson would be a
critique of ~politics,~

rather than critique ~as~ politics or if its effects.






And I'm not convinced that all the quotes that you
collect as counter-weight would in fact hold up as
substantively "political" under further review.

In your first example, I can certainly recognize
"packaging" and even "exchange" as being more of his
cynicism (critique) about relations, alright.  But the
abstractness of the surrounding thought ("Reception is
a particular . . ., an object. This establishes, if
attended, a paradigm . . . , walking across the room
to find it") seems entirely the language of the
"philosophical" Davidson that I was arguing.  (The
currency of the term "paradigm" originates in
~science,~ with Kuhn's ~Structure of Scientific
Revolutions,~ and in linguistics, with Jakobsen's
paradigmatic axis, ---to name only one.)

This effect of his writing, ---a tendency, where
political vocabulary does occur, for it to occur as
flotsam within a field of other-than-political
discourse,--- is what I tried to describe as a
fragmentary, residual vocabulary being embedded in an
unintegrated way.  There has been no ~absorption~ of
those elements.   They're garnished on.  If the first
17 pages are very, very politically charged but you're
more or less leaving it undisputed that a (terribly)
close reading shows the remaining 83 to be only
marginally political,--- that's why I was saying that
the political in him is ~"split-off"!~   Amassing it
mainly in the book's prelude or overture
~compartmentalizes~ any politicism.


And so on, throughout your examples (another
difference in our two methods is that I tried to offer
paraphrased explanations alongside each individual
quote.  You're treating your quotes ---voila!--- as
self-evident.  They're not): The politics of "Entering
is participation, identity, multiply unique,
restricted to what replays, recalls, aligns, within
the silence that tells about feeding it" seems
hermetic, at best, to me (What do you imagine that all
those abstractions ~mean,~ that it could be an
illustration of "critique of productivised social
relations"?   There seems to be a great deal of
~reading into on your part.  Is it that you equate
abstraction with politics?  We seem to be reading
English with two incompatible dictionaries. What I
considered to be an absolute ~depth sounding~ of the
book, you're calling "face value."  [At what level,
then, ~should~ his "dream" poetry be taken, given the
first 17 pages?   What does "dream" mean in light of
all this political re-tuning? You seem to be saying
that getting through "Product" would've allowed me to
coast down-hill from there on and only ~half~-read the
rest of the book, to unburden everything I found there
of its meaning.]  To me, that language is
psychological ["identity"] or technological
["replays"], etc.  Please: What part of the word
"silence" am I not understanding?).  Etc., etc. I
absolutely cannot see what political resonance you
find in "See the differences . . . at all locations".
. . . Etc.: "Blend in, stand out, in the fragrant
melding of trust, warmth and comfort, a fabrication
learning to collect"--- politics??   I can see the
politics in "armed camp" (who could miss it?) but, in
the same sentence that you're arguing against my
claims, "ritual" only takes us back to the
belief-religiosity question, and "never far from"
right back to the "distance" motif.



Yes, to an exent, of course, we're playing Ten Blind
Indian Swamis Meet Their First Elephant.   The blind
swami who touches the elephant's trunk says it's a
serpent, and the blind swami who touches its leg says
it's a tree trunk . . .

My omission of "Product" was not "selectively
ignoring" (in the sense of purposefully "conveniently"
or some sort of unfriendly intentionality).  It was
done arbitrarily.  I ~said~ "I confess to having,
currently, skipped over the opening poem, 'Product.'"
"Product" is shaped differently on the page; more of
it is prose.  Sometimes I skip over prose parts in
poetry books: I find that I can't switch my
meter-meter quickly.  (I once burned a CD of all the
connective recitative interludes in Handel's opera,
~Radamisto,~ and left out all the arias.)   I never
saw "Deer Hunter."  I'm sorry the dog ate the first 17
pages of my copy!

So, I'll read "Product."


{"Return and there's another bag. Return and there's
another bag. Return and there's another bag" sounds
like just the kind of Koyanisqaatsi politics I can't
get enough of.}

The wink owes the semi-colon for part of its recent
prestige, for without it and the waggish world of
emoticons, the wink would be clinking styrofoam with
the raised eyebrow and the wrinkled forehead, two
doors down from frown. Certainly the smile is hated by
all, but cannodling with that social climber the
nudge, the wink thinks the world's a tub of jello, but
still, to this very day, has no clue where the guffaw
and licked lips winter.

You state that if the protests against the vietnam war* were ever effective,
that was peobably only indirectly  so. That's a puzzling sentence. It raises
more questions than it answers. How could a protest be effective, while
being only indirectly so? That's the one that stumps me. But being only a
bear of very little brain, I direct this question to Mr tefans, who I'm sure
can make it clearer.  David

RS  Immortal lines!!  You have put the ink in the wink or the wink in ink:
Twink! in a twink! there's no gainsaying o' the wink: it hath the edge on
the nudge and the nub: it is what we were in our Pater's eyes; it is higher

Crown: and  Jolly One he cometh in Yuletide time: it hangeth well on the
hanged and puts the lie to those who lie: the wink is perilously close by a
Vowel I speak not what: it knoweth its part: it keepeth behind the Colon:
yet to a semi colon it thinks: and it Wrinks: for the semi is only half: and
the PM wink is of course the King of all Winks: who twists like a crooked
Shrink: it Thinks: but who could shrink from a wink? But the nudge: a stout
fellow is Nudge: but the Guffaw I do declare be a Bore: a Rogue a Rogue and
a Bore.  But the wink....ah, The Wink!  R. T.

POETRY MATTERS!
On the Media Persecution of Amiri Baraka

Poetry Festivals don?t usually trigger hate campaigns or Red Scares, but
this year?s Geraldine Dodge Poetry Festival at Waterloo Village in
Stanhope, New Jersey, proved to be different. There, on September 19th,
Amiri Baraka read his poem "Somebody Blew Up America." The applause was
thunderous, but some people apparently didn?t like it, for almost
immediately the poet was singled out for an incredible barrage of
vilification by Murdoch?s Fox News, the New York Times, the National
Review, and scores?by now probably many hundreds?of bigoted,
neoconservative, white-supremacist talk-shows and periodicals. Leading the
assault on the poet is the so-called Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a
powerful right-wing political organization notorious for its virulent
opposition to Affirmative Action and for its routine use of character
assassination against its critics.

It so happens that Baraka wrote "Somebody Blew Up America" in
September/October 2001, in the weeks following the tragedy known to all as
"9-11." The 226-line poem was promptly posted on the Internet, copied onto
many websites, and further publicized by the poet at numerous well-attended
readings all over the U.S. and in many other countries. It quickly became
one of the most widely circulated of his works. No attempt was made to
conceal the fact that the poem was, in Baraka?s own words, "an attack on
Imperialism, National Oppression, Monopoly Capitalism, Racism,
Anti-Semitism," and that it was meant to "probe and disturb." Not until the
Dodge Poetry Festival, however, did anyone object to it.

What provoked the sudden media war on Amiri Baraka in September 2002?
Assuredly it was not merely a difference of opinion regarding the art of
poetry. In truth, despite the hue and cry, the poem itself is not the
central issue here. In any event, the principal charge alleged against the
poem (that it is "anti-Semitic") cannot withstand a moment?s critical
examination. Indeed, with its salute to the memory of such revered Jewish
revolutionists as Rosa Luxemburg, and the questions it raises about U.S.
capitalism?s little-known complicity in the Holocaust, Baraka?s poem is
explicitly against anti-Semitism and all racism. If the ADL?s hollow
charge, repeated ad nauseam by the media, had even the slightest substance,
how are we to account for the fact that it was completely unnoticed by the
hundreds of thousands who had read or heard the poem during the preceding
year? (The ADL, of course, construes any and all criticism of the Israeli
government?even the merest mention of its long support of South African
Apartheid, for example?as "anti-Semitic.")

No less spurious is the ADL?s puerile argument that Baraka?s poem is
helping to foment "anti-American xenophobia," but this charge?bristling
with sinister insinuations?does bring us closer to the real issues at stake
in the media "police action" against the



poet. For what the ADL, neoconservatives and repentant ex-New-Leftists
really hate about Baraka is that he is a sharp critic of this country?s
anti-democratic institutions, and an activist who has time and again
protested the U.S. government?s repressive role in foreign and domestic
affairs. Worse yet, from the point of view of the white ruling class and
the politicians who do its bidding, Baraka is also an outspoken
revolutionary.

Clearly, then, the real target of the ADL?s ongoing defamation of the
author of "Somebody Blew Up America" is not that particular poem, or any
other poem, but the poet himself, his revolutionary courage and audacity,
and above all his ability to articulate the anxieties and yearnings of
those "furthest down" in humankind?s long hard struggle against inequality
and tyranny.

The question, "Why did the assault on the poet start as late as September
2002?" is easily answered: Because in August, a few weeks before the Dodge
Poetry Festival, Amiri Baraka became the poet laureate of the State of New
Jersey. An honorary title with a small stipend, this was far from a
position of power, but for the state?s corrupt "business-as-usual"
Establishment, it was evidently way too much.

And so Baraka?s poem?or rather, the distorted, out-of-context fragments
quoted by his critics in the press and on TV?was made a pretext for racial
and political persecution by that arch-enemy of all poetry, solidarity, and
freedom: the white power structure.

The ADL and other bigots are demanding that Baraka be removed as poet
laureate. Cravenly submitting to white-supremacist pressure-groups, New
Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey has formally asked the poet not only to
resign as laureate, but also to apologize for his poem! Baraka has refused.

In the current U.S. political climate: a climate of domination, fear, and
insipid conformism; increasing government surveillance and curtailing of
civil rights and liberties; persecution of immi-grants, radicals, and
organized labor; massive militarization and flag-waving war hysteria, all
promoted by an unelected President and a billionaire-owned media?the
assault on Amiri Baraka is a matter of the greatest concern to all who care
about human free-dom, the right to dream, and the right to speak out.

This attack on a poet is an attack on all poets, all poetry, and all free
speech. The persecution of Baraka is about stifling poetry, suppressing
criticism, silencing voices of dissent. It is about censor-ship and
coercion; the imposition of conformity and misery; the denial of freedom.

We say:

Hands Off Amiri Baraka!

Long live the unfettered imagination!

An injury to One is an injury to All!

Hi Jeffrey,

I'm finding it difficult to respond. I think your reading of culture is both
interesting and different from my own, not entirely different. It's really
one element that I'm seeing in there, the political, which you're not
granting it, or are finding wanting or less integrated. I never said you
*had* to see it; my point was simply that I do see it, and tried to point to
one area where it seemed most obvious, as it was an area you admittedly had
passed over.

But, the kinds of language you use, the kinds of characterizations you're
making, I don't know what to do with. I'm not some schoolmaster trying to
get you to eat your meat before pudding--where does that come from? Or this:
"I am at least having the honesty to argue that it's a disservice to his
artistry to leave all that out of the picture." In other words, I'm being
dishonest by bringing in yet one more element into the picture?

From the beginning your critique seemed to me to stem from the accusation of
some fundamental dishonesty on the part of anyone who might see Dan's book
in different light than your own. The SPD catalog and Ben and I were all
lying to you. Or that I only see a political aspect of Dan's work because
I'm as you put it "prejudiced."

I never said that the political element in Dan's work was "unsullied" (I'd
use a different word; I'd say "complicated") with/by the philosophical,
irony, lyricism/romanticism, alienation. That's all there, even in Product;
I've never said it wasn't. It is, in fact, that alienation, most strongly
resonant (for me) in "Anomie," that I am most critical of in my own reading
of the work, what I find in it to be ultimately of less, or even corrosive,
value. It's that aspect that I see inextricably linked to his suicide.

Obviously we disagree as to whether or not the political was fully
integrated throughout the work. I feel it is, after having read the book a
number of times over the last several years. You don't see it that way after
having read 85% of the inprint book and maybe 30% of the .pdf online. You
obviously have a right to talk about the book after having read what you've
read of it. But, why don't I have the right to counter that reading, to
complicate it, with my own, without being accused of being "prejudiced" or
"dishonest"? I'm admittedly baffled.

I find it hard to continue a discussion with someone who at the very least
does not respect that when someone else disagrees with them, it's not simply
because they are attempting to pull the wool over others' eyes.

I feel that, in your reading of his work, which is an admirably close
reading (though it doesn't take the whole book into account), that you take
statements made in the work on more of a face-value level than I do. I see
it more as him writing at some remove, weaving various discourses throughout
the book. His relationship with them is complex, not always direct, but
neither completely removed from--just at "some remove" from. Similar to J.H.
Prynne, who was a hero of Dan's. Yes, I do  see the whole, rather than
separate parts--why is that a problem? Or why is it wrong to grant some
linearity to the project--after all, he did write "Product" first, and
everything else came afterward. Which is why he placed it first. It really
wasn't arbitrary, though if you really think I'm just some prejudiced liar,
I don't suppose you're going to take my saying that with any seriousness.

Oh well,

Gary

>>Call for papers for special issue of Style on metonymy (Volume 38,

>>
>>Guest editor Gerard Steen of a special issue of Style on metonymy
>>invites contributions from practitioners of stylistics,
>>linguistics, discourse analysis, poetics, psychology, and rhetoric
>>on the role of metonymy in style, language, text, discourse, and
>>thought, literary or non-literary.
>>
>>In the wake of the recent cognitive turn in metaphor studies, it
>>has now become metonymy that has been receiving an increased amount
>>of attention from cognitive linguists, psychologists, and cognitive
>>scientists in general. Claims are being made that metonymy is even
>>more basic to thought and language than metaphor, in the sense that
>>there are metonymic motivations for many conceptual metaphors.
>>Apart from these fundamental issues, there are many cases where
>>metaphor and metonymy interact with each other in interesting and
>>intricate ways, both in thought and in linguistic expression. And
>>an exciting related development is the emergence of a general
>>theory of conceptual integration, also known as 'blending theory',
>>which promises to offer a consistent and uniform approach to
>>metonymy, metaphor, and other types of thought and language.
>>
>>There is hence sufficient reason to publish a sequel special issue
>>of Style on metonymy, after the special issue on metaphor published
>>as volume 36, number 3 (2002).
>>
>>One aim of the special issue is to make the new research on
>>metonymy available to the readership of Style, in order to redress
>>the balance between metaphor and metonymy. Another aim is to give a
>>decided stylistic and poetic turn to the wheel of the cogntive
>>research into metonymy and metaphor alike. It seems as if many of
>>the claims made in cognitive linguistics were also made in the
>>sixties and seventies by structuralist and semiotic scholars,
>>including Umberto Eco and Jonathan Culler. Contributors are invited
>>in particular to consider the interest of these structuralist and
>>semiotic insights for cognitive linguistics, stylistics, and
>>poetics, or, the other way around, how contemporary cognitive
>>approaches to metonymy can add cognitive quality to mainstream
>>methods of literary text analysis. The special issue is hence hoped
>>to provide a platform for some innovating interdisciplinary
>>discussion.

I was about to sign, but then it occurred to me that I might be a member
of the "white power structure" and therefore "the arch-enemy of all
poetry, solidary and freedom."  And by the way, is Colin Powell a member
of the white power structure?  Or Condoleezza Rice--billed in the current
Newsweek as "the most influential woman in wartime Washington"?  Oh but I
guess they're not *really* black, are they?

whether you feel aligned or not (or whether you're serious or not) about being part of something coined "white power structure" might be a separate issue from being FEARLESS about language, and the desire to protect language, no matter who says it, and no matter what it is they say.  as poets we need to have the courage to have our words and have space for other's words help make this world become itself in words.

Baraka--whether or not you agree with what he says or feels--is rocking this great experiment we're all a part of.  merely by speaking his mind, disregarding polite banter, he will help set us all free.  the power of the language lies in our fearlessness when confronted by it or when confronting others with it.  the engine of that is our own problem, and i hope we can all get it revved!

my feeling in eliciting 'discontinuous extroversion' was that it was
applicable to us normals that exhibit ourselves here and elsewhere on the
internet.  a psychiatrist might call us demented, an academic might dismiss
us as MPDs, but poetically we are us.

with some being more discontinuous than others by posting by definition we
become extroverts?

(Can someone send Hilton <Hilton Obenzinger <hobnzngr@stanford.edu> the
name/address of the Poetix Webmaster; apparently he can read but he can no
longer deliver!  Thanks, Stephen Vincent)


Dear List,

There has been some talk about the effectiveness of anti-war protests
during the 60s and 70s, and I want to clarify something.  For some reason,
my new email program receives posts but the big Bufallo can't seem to
recognize my replies, so I thank Stephen Vincent for allowing me to
piggy-back on his address.

The US was forced out of Vietnam because of the resistance of the
Vietnamese, first and foremost, but the active and growing opposition by
people in the US played a decisive role in hampering the US military
strategy, as did the rest of international solidarity with the Vietnamese.
LBJ was forced to abdicate, and Nixon was forced to do his dirty tricks and
COINTELPRO because of the loud and persistent opposition to the war and
racism. The antics of the anti-war movement became part of a strategy of
undermining authority through laughter. I was there when Ginsberg levitated
the Pentagon in 1967 -- no one expected the colossal building to OM its way
to heaven, but it was hilarious. At a time when stone-faced creeps ran the
show, laughter and poetry and spiritual adventure claimed an alternative
worldview. They still do.

This came to me one evening.  To say I wrote it would be an exaggeration, so
be kind to it...


Typology of Screwing

There are two types of screwing: the copulatory and the carpentry
and all effort must be made to keep them apart

unfortunately,
when the carpenter screws
he does not recognize the difference
and thinks during the whole procedure of his new,
phallic,
5-button electric screwdriver:
3 speeds, two directions, and seven attachments
unfortunately,
he has only one attachment and it is highly unimpressive
according to his long-suffering wife,
who wishes he's switch it out for a larger one and use the burst
acceleration mode
available on his new tool but alas not on the tool he was born with
she too has acquired a new tool with seven attachments
but it has only two speeds
nonetheless, she finds it highly satisfactory as she can attain pleasure
without afterwards having to hear about late contractors,
incompetent employees, lumber which hasn't arrived, the arrogance of
electricians,
the corruption in the union, and his own worries about his retirement fund
she really wouldn't mind these conversations if she were allowed to give
advuce
and sympathy
but there is onky one kind of sympathy he is inetrested in
and after that
he rolls over and snores loudly
but not loud enough
to drown out her worries
that's when she goes to the bathroom
with her new tool
and gets the comfort she needs
for trouble at her high stress job
the son's learning disability
the state of the world
and her own physical discomfort

because screwing can be either carorentry or copulatory
and with her husband it is strictly carpentry

i wish i was the best balloon, the colour of splendour as a radical idea,
going down into space, which arches over us, and we gasp in awe. that's the
dedication, currently, the instant moment of saying persecution, which is
the rhetoric left to us. like, say, a crosswalk, and how we dispel traffic
by walking between. but, thinking clearly but not for long, the idea seems
mobile, as if we should all, period. exactly how is the saying said, anyway?
like, was there a day when we decided? or should we be definite in the
unction of our rhetiorical style? why not give an ocean a chance, as it
rolls up the shore, possibly to swallow all the nifty beachhouses that are
the precinct of some imaginations still. expecting to be set free, which is
a slant across the paper that is only vaguely in attendence, the dime on
which we spin. but the given is constant, unless taken. my balloon, a chance
to record, floats flaw, but langauge, after all, is a charge.

Please spread far and wide...


Our president-self-elect and his pack of psychos today (11 December 2002)
have threatened the world with nuclear strikes.

If they decide that they suspect someone even of THINKING about building any
such weapons, they insist they have the right to--get this--nuke them.


Q:  What's the point of STOPPING weapons of mass destruction if you use them
to stop them?

A:  TERROR!


And Al Gore, Mr. Walden Beach, says he agrees with this murderous,
unilateralist, psychotic, & unparalleled crime scheme.

IMPEACH GEORGE BUSH!!!

GET HIM OUT!!!

HE'S GOING TO KILL LOTS OF PEOPLE

This guy wants to set the new standard for infamy.

THEIR POLICIES AND ACTIONS ARE BEYOND ANY RATIONAL ANAYSIS OF POLICY

THEY MUST BE STOPPED BEFORE THEY GET US ALL WIPED OUT!!!!!!

In this newly-released document, the euphemism for pre-emptive strikes is
called "active defenses."

He is inviting terrorism in our country, begging that other people try and
destroy us, and even threatening to nuke other people is not going to make
our homes any safer.

Turning cities in impoverished foreign nations into molten glass isn't going
to take apart terrorist cells or stop the horrors of weapons of mass
destruction.

To think that people out there think this is a good idea is absolutely
horrifying.

While it isn't unreasonable for the US Government to act swiftly and with
force against a clear and present WMD threat against the US, it's not even
in the range of reason to nuke someone because they might have thought about
obtaining WMDs.  This sort of policy makes the Inquisition look like some
sort of traveling circus.

There he goes, terrorizing all people again...

Read it for yourself...

http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/12/WMDStrategy.pdf


If you aren't choosing to be political now, someone's gonna make you
political and not give you a choice about it.  Get motivated, get active,
get vocal, and mobilize for change.  NOW.  Now is not the time to await our
doom.

Your clever questions deserve simple answers.

Are Colin Powell & Condoleeza Rice "really" black?
Yes. They really are.

Are they members of the "white power structure"?
Yes. They really are.

The Passing of The Town


I.

the perturbations of the new erase reality

II.

lament, lament, lament
a world is passing

III.

towns turn into giant Walmarts
lose their greens and people
droids replace inhabitants

IV.

bulldozers have taken away the old houses
Home Depot is there instead
full of products for building new houses
but nobody ever does

V.

you cannot recognize your childhood street
not just the houses but the hills are gone
and yet the new houses look old
does that mean you, too, are old?
the people in the houses never knew your neighbors

VI.

what was town hall
is now a bingo room
(run by the township to pay for
the elephantine cost of adding amenities to a town destroyed)
the original building
with its majestic steps and cupola
has been forever debauched
better it should have been razed like the rest

VII.

sick of the strip the inhabitants yearn for a downtown
and so some of the last remaining old houses
are condemned
along with their elderly residents
(sent to the county home)
and a pedestrian mall is built
in the style of a downtown shopping area

VIII.

there are little shops
but not the ones there were
these shops have a taint of quaintness
and resemble each other subtly
not surprising because they're all owned by Walmart
which has spread its wares into "boutiques"
with fake differences in taste and merchandise

IX.

nonetheless
the new shopping area proves to be popular
with its well-placed bathrooms like any good mall
and natural-styled seasonal plants in bins
a new pedestrian life emerges
centered on the giant parking lot
which took out the grocery, barbershop, and mill
no manufacturing mars the new town center
and all the jobs consist of scooping ice-cream
or making cappucino

X.

this great transformation supposedly brought more work
but not for rubbery-handed veterans of the mill
who went to work at eighteen
in 1938
even their grandchildren
aren't aesthetic enough
for espresso
they instead clean the bathrooms
invisibly
earning less than grandpa did
no union allowed

X.

the cemetery
where grandpa is buried
is now a mingolf
the most authentic thing in the town
gravestones serve as obstacles
along with giant skulls with glowing eyes
and a waterway that imitates the River Styx
complete with electronic half-dead guardian of the underworld
the three headed dog Cerberus
only he is a mascot for a muffler company
and if your ball falls in his mouth you get a new muffler for free
at the end of the final hole the balls drop down into the hill
where no one dares retrieve them
someone's grave full of decaying sinews
is filling with
immortal golf balls


XI.

now the town is named as one of the nicest places to live
in a leading magazine
the old inhabitants are dead and gone
and the new ones
wouldn't know a genuine town
if they saw one
in fact
they'd find it inferior
because unpredictable

X.

mourn o mourn the passing of the town
the new world is full of fakery
but we no longer know the difference
mourn o mourn the passing of the people of the town
the droids have arrived

Millie

FRIDAY DECEMBER 13 [10:30pm]
THE BEST OF SUMMER 2002 ROOFTOP FILMS
Rooftop Films Indoors was founded in 1997 by filmmakers who were interested
in making, watching, and talking about good films in a relaxed, communal
environment. It is a volunteer-run non-profit corporation which promotes
low-budget filmmaking in New York City. This evening will be curated by
Rooftop's Moira Griffin and will showcase the best shorts from the summer
2002 series.

Also featuring "Broken English" with DJ Brett Creshaw and other DJs, and
open mike TBA.

MONDAY DECEMBER 16 [8:00pm]
JULIAN SEMILIAN AND GARRETT KALLEBERG
Julian Semilian is a poet, translator, novelist, and filmmaker. Spuyten
Duyvil Press has published a book of poems, Transgender Organ Grinder (2002)
and Green Integer will publish Semilian's translation of Paul Celan's
Romanian poems this year. His work has appeared in Exquisite Corpse,
Suitcase, Arshile, Callaloo, World Letter, Syllogism, Trepan, Romania
Libera, and Vatra (Romania). Andrei Codrescu writes: "Light permeates his
constructs and the reader can lift the skin of reference like a feather,
amazed at its soft touch. To be alone with these poems is to have enough
toys to outlast the blackout."

Garrett Kalleberg is the author of Some Mantic Daemons, Psychological
Corporations, and Limbic Odes. Ann Lauterbach writes on Some Mantic Daemons:
"For those who wish to go where poetry is rendered as a limitless limit,
fretted with knowings and unknowings and their generative inquisitions. Once
again, the life of the mind finds its avatar." His poems and reviews have
appeared in Sulfur, First Intensity, Denver Quarterly, Mandorla, American
Letters Commentary, and in An Anthology of New (American) Poets (Talisman
House). In Brooklyn, New York, he publishes the online literary journal The
Transcendental Friend, and audio CD imprint Immanent Audio. Garrett is also
a principal in the theatrical company, Brooklyn Drama Club, whose The
Situation Room is currently showing in New York.

WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 18 [8:00pm]
ROBERT ASHLEY AND EMILY XYZ
Robert Ashley is known for his work in new forms of opera and
multi-disciplinary projects. During the 1970s, he produced and directed
Music with Roots in the Aether, a 14-hour television opera/documentary about
the work and ideas of seven American composers. Ashley wrote and produced
Perfect Lives, an opera for television widely considered to be the precursor
of "music-television." More recently, he has completed When Famous Last
Words Fail You for the American Composers Orchestra, Your Money My Life
Good-bye for Bayerischer Rundfunk, and Dust for premiere at the Kanagawa
Arts Foundation in Yokohama. He is at work on a new opera entitled Celestial
Excursions, commissioned by the Berlin Festival, to be presented at the
Hebbel Theater (Berlin) in March 2003 and at the Kitchen (New York) in April
2003.

Emily XYZ has been creating verbal soundscapes for single and multiple
voices since 1980. She has performed at the Sydney Arts Festival and the
Ottawa Arts Center. Other performances abroad include Munich, Leipzig,
Heidelberg and Berlin. In the USA appearances include the Green Mill in
Chicago, the Hayti Arts Center in Durham, North Carolina, and in New York at
Alice Tully Hall, Jackie 60, the Nuyorican, CBGB, Dixon Place, MoMa, and the
Bowery Poetry Club. Her online poetry store debuts this month at
www.emilyxyz.com.

Some months ago there was a post about Temenos Magazine.  They took some work
and announced they were publishing in June.  Here it is December and nothing.
 Their hotmail email address seems defunct.

Anyone know anything about them?

MIME-Version: 1.0

st. john's, NF


Running the Goat, Books & Broadsides is pleased to announce its newest chapbook -- Merrybegot, by Mary Dalton. The chapbook will be launched Tuesday, December 17th at the Gallery of the LSPU Hall from 7 - 9 pm. There will be readings by Mary Dalton, songs from Anita Best and tunes from Colin Carrigan and Graham Wells. Cash bar.
Please come and help us celebrate this lovely new book!

Another South
Experimental Writing in the South
Edited by Bill Lavender
Introduction by Hank Lazer

"An upstart collection, and it's high time."
--C. D. Wright, author of Deepstep Come Shining

This collection gathers the best work of flourishing but often-neglected=20
avant-garde southern poets, who collectively represent a new direction of=20
southern writing that is at once universal in its appeal and regional in=20
its flavor. The selected writers are working in forms that are radical,=20
innovative, and visionary, employing devices such as syntactical=20
disjunctions, formal revolutions, or playful typography.

Focusing on poets currently residing in the South, the anthology includes=20
both emerging and established voices in the national and international=20
literary world. From the invocations of Andy Young's "Vodou Headwashing=20
Ceremony" to the blues-informed poems of Lorenzo Thomas and Honoree=20
Jeffers, from the different voicings of John Lowther and Kalamu ya Salaam=20
to the visual, multi-genre art of Jake Berry, David Thomas Roberts, and Bob=
=20
Grumman, the poetry in Another South is rich in variety and enthusiastic in=
=20
its explorations of new ways to embody place and time. These writers have=20
made the South lush with a poetic avant-garde all its own, not only=20
redefining southern identity and voice but also offering new models of what=
=20
is possible universally through the medium of poetry.
Hank Lazer's introductory essay on "Kudzu textuality" contextualizes the=20
work by these contemporary innovators. Like the uncontrollable runaway vine=
=20
that entwines the southern landscape, their poems are hyperfertile,=20
stretching their roots and shoots relentlessly, at once destructive and=20
regenerative. In making a radical departure from nostalgic southern=20
literary voices, these poems of polyvocal abundance are closer in spirit to=
=20
"speaking in tongues" or apocalyptic southern folk art--primitive,=20
astonishing, and mystic.

This is a tough one, I think. I'm very much inclined to sign the petition,
but I find the accompanying letter problematic as I don't see this issue as
Baraka = hero, those offended by the poem = the bad guys. I absolutely do
not think he should be asked to step down from his post (and, like Barrett,
find it extremely troublesome that both Baraka and Troupe have come under
such fire as of late) but to paint this as simply a free speech issue is a
bit troublesome as is also, I believe, to pretend this is a good poem. It's
not. But you don't fire people for that. The thing is, yes, he's got obvious
angry references to the holocaust, but he does also perpetuate what I've got
to believe is a myth, that 4,000 (!) Israelis stayed away from the WTC on
Sept. 11. Is this anti-Semitic? No, because "Semitic" is a horribly misused
term which, first of all, refers to a group of languages and not a people,
and, second of all, as such, would also include Palestinians and other
Arab-speaking peoples most often accused of being "Anti-Semitic." Is it a
dangerous myth to perpetuate? Well, it's certainly not serving
anyone/anything, least (most) of all, the poem itself. To act as if the ADL
is simply drawing its opposition to the poem from thin air seems pretty
disingenuous. Should we also believe, then, that Trent Lott simply misspoke?

POETRY MATTERS!
On the Media Persecution of Amiri Baraka

Poetry Festivals don?t usually trigger hate campaigns or Red Scares, but
this year?s Geraldine Dodge Poetry Festival at Waterloo Village in
Stanhope, New Jersey, proved to be different. There, on September 19th,
Amiri Baraka read his poem "Somebody Blew Up America." The applause was
thunderous, but some people apparently didn?t like it, for almost
immediately the poet was singled out for an incredible barrage of
vilification by Murdoch?s Fox News, the New York Times, the National
Review, and scores?by now probably many hundreds?of bigoted,
neoconservative, white-supremacist talk-shows and periodicals. Leading the
assault on the poet is the so-called Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a
powerful right-wing political organization notorious for its virulent
opposition to Affirmative Action and for its routine use of character
assassination against its critics.

It so happens that Baraka wrote "Somebody Blew Up America" in
September/October 2001, in the weeks following the tragedy known to all as
"9-11." The 226-line poem was promptly posted on the Internet, copied onto
many websites, and further publicized by the poet at numerous well-attended
readings all over the U.S. and in many other countries. It quickly became
one of the most widely circulated of his works. No attempt was made to
conceal the fact that the poem was, in Baraka?s own words, "an attack on
Imperialism, National Oppression, Monopoly Capitalism, Racism,
Anti-Semitism," and that it was meant to "probe and disturb." Not until the
Dodge Poetry Festival, however, did anyone object to it.

What provoked the sudden media war on Amiri Baraka in September 2002?
Assuredly it was not merely a difference of opinion regarding the art of
poetry. In truth, despite the hue and cry, the poem itself is not the
central issue here. In any event, the principal charge alleged against the
poem (that it is "anti-Semitic") cannot withstand a moment?s critical
examination. Indeed, with its salute to the memory of such revered Jewish
revolutionists as Rosa Luxemburg, and the questions it raises about U.S.
capitalism?s little-known complicity in the Holocaust, Baraka?s poem is
explicitly against anti-Semitism and all racism. If the ADL?s hollow
charge, repeated ad nauseam by the media, had even the slightest substance,
how are we to account for the fact that it was completely unnoticed by the
hundreds of thousands who had read or heard the poem during the preceding
year? (The ADL, of course, construes any and all criticism of the Israeli
government?even the merest mention of its long support of South African
Apartheid, for example?as "anti-Semitic.")

No less spurious is the ADL?s puerile argument that Baraka?s poem is
helping to foment "anti-American xenophobia," but this charge?bristling
with sinister insinuations?does bring us closer to the real issues at stake
in the media "police action" against the



poet. For what the ADL, neoconservatives and repentant ex-New-Leftists
really hate about Baraka is that he is a sharp critic of this country?s
anti-democratic institutions, and an activist who has time and again
protested the U.S. government?s repressive role in foreign and domestic
affairs. Worse yet, from the point of view of the white ruling class and
the politicians who do its bidding, Baraka is also an outspoken
revolutionary.

Clearly, then, the real target of the ADL?s ongoing defamation of the
author of "Somebody Blew Up America" is not that particular poem, or any
other poem, but the poet himself, his revolutionary courage and audacity,
and above all his ability to articulate the anxieties and yearnings of
those "furthest down" in humankind?s long hard struggle against inequality
and tyranny.

The question, "Why did the assault on the poet start as late as September
2002?" is easily answered: Because in August, a few weeks before the Dodge
Poetry Festival, Amiri Baraka became the poet laureate of the State of New
Jersey. An honorary title with a small stipend, this was far from a
position of power, but for the state?s corrupt "business-as-usual"
Establishment, it was evidently way too much.

And so Baraka?s poem?or rather, the distorted, out-of-context fragments
quoted by his critics in the press and on TV?was made a pretext for racial
and political persecution by that arch-enemy of all poetry, solidarity, and
freedom: the white power structure.

The ADL and other bigots are demanding that Baraka be removed as poet
laureate. Cravenly submitting to white-supremacist pressure-groups, New
Jersey Governor James E. McGreevey has formally asked the poet not only to
resign as laureate, but also to apologize for his poem! Baraka has refused.

In the current U.S. political climate: a climate of domination, fear, and
insipid conformism; increasing government surveillance and curtailing of
civil rights and liberties; persecution of immi-grants, radicals, and
organized labor; massive militarization and flag-waving war hysteria, all
promoted by an unelected President and a billionaire-owned media?the
assault on Amiri Baraka is a matter of the greatest concern to all who care
about human free-dom, the right to dream, and the right to speak out.

This attack on a poet is an attack on all poets, all poetry, and all free
speech. The persecution of Baraka is about stifling poetry, suppressing
criticism, silencing voices of dissent. It is about censor-ship and
coercion; the imposition of conformity and misery; the denial of freedom.

We say:

Hands Off Amiri Baraka!

Long live the unfettered imagination!

An injury to One is an injury to All!

Beneath the Underground Books is proud to announce the publication of =
IMPROVISATIONS (XXV-L), the second volume of Vernon Frazer's continuing =
high octane poetic exploration of sound, sense, consciousness and =
perception that began with IMPROVISATIONS (I-XXIV). In this section of =
the open-ended work, Frazer's verbal music and visual textures- literary =
counterparts to free jazz and action painting- blaze through each =
extended poem/chorus with a vitality and invention that approaches the =
ecstatic intensity of glossolalia.



"Frazer's lines sometimes arrive to us in huge chunks of =
margin-to-margin text, while at other junctures, white space dominates =
Improvisations and the words are nothing more than momentary islands for =
the eye. On some pages, the lines form themselves into geometrical =
arrangements (triangular shapes being a favorite), and on others, =
graphical lines -- vertical (some vertical lines drawn right through the =
text itself) and horizontal -- and brackets affect poem =
progression...Improvisations often avoids overt surface meanings, =
preferring instead to allow its rhythmical qualities to try and =
overwhelm our senses; for if the senses can be overcome, perhaps the =
mind can be pulled into another, perhaps higher, realm of meaning =
altogether..."=20

Subject: Thank you - Anthology of Art Archive opens

Dear  Alan,

We are writing to thank you for helping make the Anthology of Art
project such a success.

The yearlong project is now completed. Thanks to your participation, it
was possible to test this self-curated process which led to a
plural artwork and a truly international collaboration. The
complete archive of  156 image and 156 text contributions is now posted
on the Anthology of Art website and, for the first time, fully
Accessible <http://www.anthology-of-art.net/>

All contributions will be published in a catalogue for the Anthology of
Art exhibition at the Gropius-Bau in Berlin (April to August 2004). In
conjunction with the exhibition, the Akademie der K=FCnste in Berlin and
the Neuhardenberg Foundation (Neuhardenberg) will be organizing the
=B3Manifest/Symposium=B2. In 2002/2003 the School of Fine Arts in
Braunschweig, the Visual arts department at the University of Rennes,
and the Art history department of the University of Budapest will host
an international research-project about the Anthology of Art.

We hope you enjoy referring back to the Anthology of Art archive. We
will update you on future developments with the project.

If you have any further questions please don=B9t hesitate to contact us at
<mail@anthology-of-art.net>

Thank you once again for your contribution.

Kirstin, i'm glad you brought up Trent Lott.  this of course raises all kinds of questions.  should we defend poets for speaking their minds while flogging politicians?  what do we expect from our politicians?  and poets?  are both protected to speak their minds equally?

and really, what of the ADL?  should we defend a group who speaks their mind about wanting others to not speak their mind?

and what about the recent ruling on cross burning?  is this relevant to the conversation?  should protection of expression be selective?

the language of the petition is strong, whips around, but is ultimately written to protect the voice of a poet.  and this act will in turn help unify the rest of us in taking such matters of free speech seriously, if we haven't already been doing so.  i know you said we shouldn't look at this as JUST a matter of free speech, but really, in the end, despite the motives, despite the message, despite the emotions, it comes down to wanting to punish a poet for writing a poem.

whether Baraka's poem is good or not is irrelevant, by the way, don't you think?  who cares about the craft of the poem, should it be allowed is the question.  there's plenty of poetry out there, and i'm sure nobody has ever liked it all.

I think that what you say is good here: it IS a worry that Baraka etc are
targeted.  Now I think that since S11 thiings have got very confused and I
admit at times I've lost my head on this with my post that upset Nick
Piombino and do on...now I had to explain that I meant  really  " I'm very
angry (because SAD at the killing etc by both sides in Israel/Palestine)
about things as they are noot improving and people are dying daily.....so I
said (more or less) HENCE Israel should be obliterated  ...BUT the
implication is IF they continue on their present course..."  now I have also
tried to suggest (previously) that a negotiated settlement (but any and  all
of my "normal" suggestions were totaly ignored it wasnt till I said that
they SHOULD BE OBLITERATED that I got a response!! Hence: ergo propter hoc
or whatever the phrase is!) by a truly representative united nations (NOT
one dominated by any countries or country) which would put troops (in
serious numbers) into Israel/Paelstine and set up a complete buffer. Then
the place could be either made into a secular democratic state with
Palestinians and Jews (should one always use capitals with Palestinian and
Jew?...langauage again...) having equality...OR two separate States could be
formed). This of course is also fraught but I think that like the Yugoslav
conflict this one is too terrible..has gone on too long.  But the S11
situation has been linked to all these issues .... now there are people in
the Arab nations who are very racist toward Jewish people and I was
"talking" to someone in Egypt (in the Internet Chess Club) and siding with
an Israeli  beacuase he was quoting "The Protocols of Zion" now both I and
the Israeli knew that those were fabricated racist nonsense. The Nazis used
them to justify an attempt to exterminate and bully  etc the Jewish people.

Now Baraka is different in degree at least ( I dont think he's a racist  the
way that the Nazis were...I think he is impassioned: although of course it
might all be piss in wind...I dont know the man....I havent really studied
the/his "Who bombed..." poem ...I dont like that kind of poetry much: but
like Ginsberg's Howl it might acheive something (did Howl or America or
Kaddish acheive anything?): unfortunatetly even if it might be true that
some Israelis were warned by their secret service, its fuel to the fire of
the anti-semites (which as you say is  a dubious term: I dont see the Jews
as a race they are just people who unite and any unity comes from a shared
cultural/historical/religious situation (and they are a very diverse
peoples...and so for example are the Arabic people: as are all peoples
everywhere..)).  I dont think Baraka should be sacked but certainly some of
the right wing (certain kinds of white supremacists etc I mean) will have
seized on what he says: so he would have been wiser to have kept the Israel
issue separate (although at a more sophisticated level we know they are
linked or could be in some way/ways) but apart from that what is done is
done and his explanation of his poem is by and large makes sense.

It almost seems that for the US or the "Right" US or the apathetic to notice
anything imprtant you have to do or say something crazy...however:
negotiation wherever possible is best.....and Baraka maybe was unwise on the
4000 issue.

Again I think we as a "group" should ask him to talk on here and we can then
ask him his view and discuss matters and or vent our spleen: that is
healthy.  Another point: angry confrontation is not always unhealthy (it may
be frequently unproductive in MOST cases but its part of life): it shows
that the person/people who are angry does/do care...now anger is maybe
destructive but, as I say it does usually indicate a concern. So we have
angry people who are of Jewish (religion culture background etc and angry
poets and angry (or passionate may be a better term as angry as Nick
piombino says can become bullying: and it can, THT was a valid point Nick
made...) left winger and people of arabic or muslemic  persuasion...whatever
.. so a discussion with  Left and the Right (which I know sometimes these
can be almost totally interchanged) and Baraka etc on this might be crazy
but we are in cyber space so the sticks and stones wouldnt get us and
something might be learnt from both "sides"...maybe not. ?

Another thing lurking behind all this on a slightly errant track, is the
question of "language" if: all this should interest those of us who are
intersted in the writings of the Langpos  etc (and I mean eg Bernstein
Silliman Heijinian HoweAndrews Watten Bromige Nick and many others of the
L=A=N=G  (who thought that up that L= etc??!)  "school" as we are seeing
"language in action" here in this devate and in various poems including Alan
Sondheim's etc and rhetoric is battling the more gritty  "intellectual"
stuff and irony clashes with lyricism and our words do or dont (which?)
start to matter and the problems of communication...the paroles and
langues...the various post modern philosophies of language are seen here
sparking away like the deflector shield on the language cultural human craft
of Spocks and Kirks hurtkllling (creative mistake - copywrite!) toward only
hell knows where....but hopefully there is hope.

Richard

PS I wont sign (even if I can - I did sign another petition, maybe that was
organised by teh CIA!!)) it because I think that some men in dark suits will
turn up one day soon (even here in NZ!!) (sooner than I think maybe!!) or
I'll be shafted somewhow so for now I plead paranoia and cowardice - better
part of valour - and also dodge away as I'm not an American in these global
times!!

NO MORE WAR

We want to be good citizens. We want to make an anti-war piece. We want to
be effectual. We are frightened of this war and of this country. We are
frightened by the madman at the top.

We write NO MORE WAR at the beginning of the piece. We write it loud and
clear. No one can mistake our message. We owe everything to Godard.

We begin the piece. We will show horrors of war. We will show wounded and
dying soldiers. We will show parts of bodies and we will speak with the
mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, of soldiers. We will show the
nightmare of wounded cities. We will show bombed-out hospitals and
schools. We will show dolls and stuffed animals and dead children in the
ruins.

This is not enough. We will show Auschwitz. We will not show Auschwitz;
Auschwitz is a call to war. We will show nuclear explosions and napalm. We
will show dying animals. We will write THIS IS THE EFFECT OF WAR.

This is not enough. We show more mutilated bodies. We show more dead
soldiers, dead men, dead women, dead children. We write THIS IS ALSO THE
EFFECT OF WAR. We show the rites and mourning of survivors. We show
starving families and empty landscapes and destroyed villages. We write
AND THIS. We write AND THIS AND THIS.

This is not enough. Nothing is enough. We will make our piece and we will
show it. It is never enough. We write IT IS NEVER ENOUGH.

Hey

i happen to think it's a pretty powerful poem (tho 'rant' is more like what
it is) -- have you heard it read aloud?

we read the poem out loud in a workshop -- in fact there are several jewish
women in the workshop, and it fell to one of them to read the 'offensive'
part.

the whole thing's offensive, man! it's meant to be! all of those "Who, who,
who"s like fingers pointing at you, and you, and you (and me). you can't sit
in a room and read the poem out loud with a group of people and not be
uncomfortable, shaken up. but it became apparent as we read it that it
wasn't meant as merely an "anti-semite" or anti-jewish spiel -- it's
anti-everything! it may or may not have been a bad judgment call to put in
the part about the 4000 israelis skipping work but you've got to realize
that this whole poem is a catalogue of injustices -- real or perceived --
rumors, etc. it's not the poet's job to be factually true, but to report the
truth of what's in the ether, what people are talking about on the street.
and you can say that it was very effective in terms of stirring things up
and making people uncomfortable, which is what it was meant to do.

if you get into applying notions of 'craft' to it -- well, what and whose
notions of 'craft'? it's got tons of craft in terms of being a performance
piece.

the OTHER question -- "should we defend poets for speaking their minds while
flogging politicians?" --  a politician is ostensibly supposed to be
representing a "polis," and if what he sez reveals the confines of that
polis to be a select few (in this case, white), then yes, he deserves to be
flogged. at least it's not roman times when they might literally cut off his
hands and hang them from the rostrum! all that's going to happen is that he
might lose his precious post as maj. leader. as far as i can tell, no one is
questioning lott's right to say what he said. no one is threatening to strip
him of his senatorship, or take away his salary, no one is calling in death
threats. he made a politically stupid move. being a politician, there are
consequences. amiri, being a poet, has a duty to speak his mind, and the
right to do so without being censured. if lott really believed in what he
said, he could always quit the repub. party and run on his own 1948-era
segregationist ticket, and THEN we could talk about free speech.

I agree that we live in a racist society where people of color are often
discriminated against.  That's a reality that has to be acknowledged and
dealt with.  But at the same time, I don't think the dichotomous language
(and thinking) of the petition is particularly helpful.  The dichotomy
itself is a structural element contributing to racist thinking and action.

When I used to teach James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored
Man, I would put the following on the board:

white woman .... black child
black woman  X   white child

And say, ok, a white woman can have a black child, but a black woman
cannot have a white child.  Is this a biological fact or a social fact?

Of course, it's a social fact and it's predicated on a holdover of the
"one drop" rule that has defined race relations in this country.  If you
have "one drop" of black blood then you're black.  One could just as
easily
make the opposite claim:  if you have "one drop" of white blood then
you're white.  That didn't happen, of course, because "white" was the norm
(won't be for much longer) and the privileged position.  The admixture of
color was seen as contamination.  But to reverse the value system, giving
the label "bad" or even "evil" to all things white (or giving the name
white to all things evil) doesn't get you out of the dichotomy, or the
problems that come with it.  To do that, both "sides" would have to face
up to their relatedness.

can you smell that backwards

I knock at the door, no I ring the bell, no I call
every time its the same thing
hello you have three seconds to live
or please leave a message at the beep
or there=92s no one here by your name

no
that's not it
lets see
it starts with a bang on the head
I forget the pass word
use my last dine for a local call that costs quarter
I talk long enough to say . . .

then the crush happens
everyone I pass on the street whispers
come to our party
sprinkled with discount holiday sugar

the dead say something like hello is this the right number for spare=20
change
can you spare a a moment of quiet
can we just get along
I heard that somewhere
always wondered if it was staged like the mass invitation of thoughts=20
into my brain

it always happens around this time
when I think we are eye-to-eye
I turn around and they have entered the forbidden zone
the usual rattle sound rattles around
someone speaks a sort of rubbery french
body fluids are exchanged
more mumbling
the fabric tears
someone is stationed around the world
I say =93=EAtes vous pr=EAt encore=94

a door opens
hands extend
candles lit
I pull a cat out of a box or a hat
or its the wrong address

MASS MARCH ON JANUARY 18 TO DEMAND
NO WAR AGAINST IRAQ -- ELIMINATE U.S. WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

Please read the following email for important updates about the scenario for
the January 18 National Marches in Washington DC and San Francisco to say
"No War on Iraq" and for an alert on Bush's moves toward first strike
nuclear war.

**********

The world is being menaced by Weapons of Mass Destruction by a government
that is openly threatening and planning to use nuclear weapons in preemptive
wars of aggression against others, including non-nuclear countries. While
all eyes are focused on the purported threat coming from Iraq, the Bush
Administration has sharply reorganized U.S. military doctrine and strategy
as it prepares to actually use Weapons of Mass Destruction in coming
conflicts as a matter of declared policy.

It is for this reason that on January 18, people across the United States
will demand the immediate elimination of US weapons of mass destruction and
a people's inspection team will call for unfettered access and a full
declaration of U.S. non-conventional weapons systems.

Bush seeks to have world attention focused on the disarmament of Iraq as the
preeminent threat to world peace, while the real threat of nuclear war and
the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction arises within the U.S.
Administration. This is the politics of diversion and should give pause to
those who are thinking of joining in Bush's sleight-of-hand anti-Iraq chorus
believing it to be a path to peace. The nuclear threat posed by the United
States is neither rhetoric nor speculation, it is the now announced doctrine
and strategy of the Bush White House. It represents the ushering in of a new
era of unrestrained and unprovoked catastrophic violence.

"Preemptive Strikes are Part of US Strategic Doctrine," reads the headline
of the front page of the Washington Post of December 11, 2002. A classified
version of the new Bush Doctrine "breaks with the fifty years of
counter-proliferation efforts" by planning for the use of nuclear weapons
against countries that not only have not attacked the US but that do not
themselves possess nuclear capability.

A.N.S.W.E.R. believes that all Weapons of Mass Destruction should be
banished from the planet. But this is impossible until the biggest arsenal
of Weapons of Mass Destruction -- the one at the disposal of trigger-happy
George W. Bush and Co. is eliminated. Any other call for disarmament will
not be viewed as legitimate by the rest of the world.

These war hawks are determined to breach the "taboo" against the use of
nuclear weapons that grew after the world experienced the horror of the
incineration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

It would be cowardly and foolish to turn our attention away from the open
threats and plans to use Weapons of Mass Destruction that are issuing from
the White House, not Iraq, and are embodied in the new Bush military
doctrine.

We must stop the Bush Administration from threatening and killing the people
of the world who are not our enemy.

*Perspective on the January 18 demonstration & Update on People's Peace
Congress*

On October 26th hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Washington,
DC and San Francisco in demonstrations called by A.N.S.W.E.R.
(http://www.InternationalANSWER.org <http://www.internationalanswer.org/> )
and in coinciding actions in 220 cities around the world.  On December 10th
thousands took part in anti-war actions called by United for Peace
(http://www.unitedforpeace.org <http://www.unitedforpeace.org/> ) in dozens
of cities around the country marking International Human Rights Day.  On
December 14, there will be an important demonstration in New York City
starting at 125th St. in Harlem that will also oppose a war in Iraq called
by Uptown Youth for Peace and Justice (http://www.uptownpj.org
<http://www.uptownpj.org/> ), and in San Francisco, ANSWER hosts an anti-war
teach-in at 7pm at the Horace Mann Middle School (23rd & Valencia).  Every
day, there are protests, rallies and teach-ins called by local organizations
in cities and towns around the United States in opposition to a new war
against Iraq.

On January 18, there will be a massive protest in Washington DC initiated by
A.N.S.W.E.R. and endorsed by thousands of organizations and individuals (for
an endorsers list, see
http://www.internationalanswer.org/campaigns/j18/endorsers.html).
This timely demonstration is gaining momentum everyday with support coming
from community, labor, student, religious, women's, civil rights, LGBT, and
peace groups around the country. On January 20, Black Voices for Peace will
be organizing an important activity in Washington DC.

We are marching in Washington DC and San Francisco on January 18 to embrace
the true legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday. The U.S. possesses
6,000 nuclear weapons. It has spent $7 trillion on their development in the
last half-century. Instead of spending $400 billion every year for weapons
of mass destruction and to promote militarism, we the people of the United
States will demand on January 18 that our money be spent to provide free
education, healthcare and childcare, jobs and job training, expanded support
for the elderly and other things that human beings need.

In San Francisco, we will meet at 11 am at Embarcadero & Market Streets and
march to Civic Center for a 1 pm rally.  The scenario for January 18th
includes a brief rally on the West side of the Capitol starting at 11 am
followed by a massive march to the Washington DC Navy Yard, a huge military
complex located in the heart of one of Washington's working class
communities, walking distance from the Capitol.

On Saturday, January 18, tens of thousands will travel by bus, van and car
caravan from all over the country for the National Marches against war on
Iraq. We encourage people to bring banners and puppets, to dress as weapons
inspectors, to find as many creative methods to dramatize our demands in
opposition to a war of aggression and in support of a reorganization of
society's priorities that would put people's needs ahead of the Pentagon and
the war profiteers in Corporate America.

Dr. Martin Luther King said, "The greatest purveyor of violence on the
planet is my own government." That statement is as true today as it was
during the Vietnam War. We will honor Dr. King's legacy by marching against
the terror that these weapons of mass destruction wreak on the world.

We also join with people all over the world who mourn the loss of Phillip
Berrigan who devoted his life to courageous opposition to militarism and
war. Phil Berrigan put his body on the line in the struggle to call
attention to the inherently evil nature of weapons of mass destruction
produced by and for the US military industrial complex. In addition to
honoring Dr. King, we intend to make the January 18 march a living tribute
to Phil Berrigan's life and legacy.

Given the feedback that we have received, we have decided that there will be
more effective organization and participation in the People's Peace Congress
if it takes place after the January 18-19-20 weekend.  Many local areas
indicated that they wanted to participate in the Peoples Peace Congress, but
reserving buses for the entire weekend was logistically difficult and
extremely expensive.  Given the response from different communities that are
excited about participation in the People's Peace Congress, we are
suggesting the rescheduling of the Congress in the spring.  The A.N.S.W.E.R.
Coalition is consulting with different member organizations and supporters,
and will announce further plans for the People's Peace Congress in the
coming weeks. Everyone agrees that the most important and urgent task --
given the imminent war danger -- is for a massive street mobilization on the
Martin Luther King birthday weekend in Washington DC.  If you're planning to
travel to and stay in Washington DC, there will be a lot to do, including
student and youth gatherings following the demonstration. Further details
will be announced soon.

 From Junction Press, Across the Line / Al otro lado: The Poetry of Baja
California, bilingual, 384 pages, edited by Harry Polkinhorn and Mark
Weiss. 53 poets, a handful of indigenous poetry, a couple of corridos, and
a whole poetic culture you've never heard of.  Cover price $25, $20 to list
members, plus $3.00 shipping in the US. Email to order.

         "If you can't make it across the border, Across the Line/Al otro
lado is the next best thing to a trip to Mexico's Baja California. The
astonishing range of fifty-three poetic voices, traditional native chants
and popular corridos which are generously presented in bilingual format is
rooted in a time and place that is both timeless and in constant flux.The
poems are by turns full of yearning, lyric, exultant, pungent, mournful,
fast-paced as the streets of Tijuana or slow as a cactus growing beyond the
dunes. Baja Californians are a population on the move, alive to change,
living on the edge, and the poetry in this lovingly-translated anthology
conveys the feel of gritty towns and cities, burning deserts, lonely
mountains, a huge sky still crowded with stars, the wind blowing in off the
Pacific or the Sea of Cortes, the nearness of gray whales and pelicans, the
uncertainties of isolation, the jittery rhythms of urban life, the United
States forever looming on the other side of the border. And I am happy to
say that these poets value the beauty and importance of Baja California'a
unique and fragile ecosystems; in Baja California moonlight still matters."
Homero Aridjis, noted Mexican poet and president of International PEN


"...a long-overdue eye-opener... Across the Line /Al otro lado should be
required reading in our high schools and colleges. ...the poets...are
always interesting, and sometimes astounding."
Luis Albert Urrea, The San Diego Union Tribune


"Across the Line / Al otro lado is an important addition to the growing
library of Mexican poetry available in bilingual edition. Polkinhorn and
Weiss have undertaken an enormous labor of love, and to a considerable
extent pull it off successfully."
Margaret Randall, American Book Review

"The translations are superlative. It is clear that an enormous amount of
work has been invested in this project, and everyone involved has earned a
vote of thanks for this latest effort toward amity and the search for a
common voice in international relations much closer to home than many of us
might realize."

As opposed to being hired for a public position for being offensive only to
an obscure minority and spreading palliative lies?

The peoples' resistance was enormous in Vietnam but there was a world wide
struggle that virtually crippled the various governments: the protest grew
even here (were there was uninvolvmedt but not conscription but never the
less there was a strong anti-war movement as we had "volunteers" in Vietnam)
and that eventually began to involve people who were more cnservative: it
was spearheaded origionally by more "militant" groups but joined by
"hippies"a nd others but it grew exponentially.

The Vietnamese people won by the application of principles of Mao Tse Tung's
guerilla war and his philosophy (his "thought") and peoples war as also
inspired by Ho Chin Minh but there were also demonstrations all over the
world and coincident with the war resistance all over the world and inside
America and Britain many Eurpoean countries, NZ, Australia, and Canada etc
there was resistance and demonstrations by the Buddhists and other INSIDE
Vietnam...that peoples' movement can be extremely embarrasssing - even
crippling to a Govt such as LBJ's  (at the time it was Holyoake inNZ  - the
war came to embarass him )...if for example Saddam Hussein actaully armed
the people of Iraq the US would be unswise to go into Iraq: the peoples war
won there but the ongoing peoples' world wide struggle is vital and it is
linked to support for Baraka and the remembrance of such as the Berrigans
(Philip andhis brother Daniel). The power of the people is enormous: the
collapse of Imperialism will  be sudden and sweeping and complete: when it
comes: make no mistake. It is right and neccessary to rebel and protest
against the insanity of Imperialist aggression and its a world wide problem:
the people of the world need to seize control of the means of production:
ultimately that will lead to disarmament but for now the smaller nations
need to arm themselves and the people need to be ready and armed in all
senses of that term.

It seems to me that Antin - if he dismissed peoples' war - appears to nbe
lurching to the Right. And also  Bruce Andrews ...one suspects that any
political action or interest is theoretical by Andrews and Antin and that
they just want to keep their well paid academic jobs while putting clever
phrases into "political" poetry. They what is known as "all talk and no do".
I hope I'm wrong.

One wonders if Trent Lott feels any sense of partnership in innocent offense
as he and Amiri Baraka go the way of censure?  Which is to presume that
Strom Thurmond had, with Baraka, a strong distaste for Jews as well as
blacks; perhaps they're joined at the hip?

The joke could at least reprsent OCD correctly. One should COUNT the number

I've just come back on the list, and I've been out of loop on recent =
discussions of Baraka, Troupe and Lott.

Baraka's 9/11 poem still doesn't particularly offend me. I worked in =
government long enough to know who and what he's talking about. I =
haven't read the poem in a while, but the "4,000 Israelis" could have =
received word from the US government as opposed to Israel's government.=20

It's sad to see a poet like Troupe put through the hoops. Writing is one =
of the few areas where you don't need a formal education, only the =
desire to learn  to read, then to write, and then to take the blows to =
the head that might  lead to success before brain damage occurs. It's a =
sad commentary on our system of artistic patronage that a person would =
feel he had to fudge his resume. Bill Clinton did much worse in another =
teapot tempest.

Given what I read in this morning's paper, Lott has a much worse history =
than I realized. Still, I wouldn't call for his resignation. He could =
serve as a reminder that Baraka correctly identified many of the people =
in  power.=20

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
     Contact: Paul Hardwin:  mailto:phardwin@yurt.org
              DowEthics.com: mailto:info@dowethics.com

DOW, BURSON-MARSTELLER CLAMP DOWN ON FAKE WEBSITES
But companies find it harder to stifle criticism

Two giant companies are struggling to shut down parody websites that
portray them unfavorably, interrupting internet use for thousands in
the process, and filing a lawsuit that pits the formidable legal
department of PR giant Burson-Marsteller against a freshman at
Hampshire College.

The activists behind the fake corporate websites have fought back, and
obtained substantial publicity in the process.

Fake websites have been used by activists before, but Dow-Chemical.com
and BursonMarsteller.com represent the first time that such websites
have successfully been used to publicize abuses by specific
corporations.

A December 3 press release originating from one of the fake sites,
Dow-Chemical.com, explained the "real" reasons that Dow could not take
responsibility for the Bhopal catastrophe, which has resulted in an
estimated 20,000 deaths over the years
(http://www.theyesmen.org/dow/#release). "Our prime responsibilities
are to the people who own Dow shares, and to the industry as a whole,"
the release stated. "We cannot do anything for the people of Bhopal."
The fake site immediately received thousands of outraged e-mails
(http://www.dowethics.com/r/about/corp/email.htm).

Within hours, the real Dow sent a legal threat to Dow-Chemical.com's
upstream provider, Verio, prompting Verio to shut down the fake Dow's
ISP for nearly a day, closing down hundreds of unrelated websites and
bulletin boards in the process.

The fake Dow website quickly resurfaced at an ISP in Australia.
(http://theyesmen.org/dow/#threat)

In a comical anticlimax, Dow then used a little-known domain-name rule
to take possession of Dow-Chemical.com
(http://theyesmen.org/dow/#story), another move which backfired when
amused journalists wrote articles in newspapers from The New York
Times to The Hindu in India (http://theyesmen.org/dow/#links), and
sympathetic activists responded by cloning and mirroring the site at
many locations, including http://www.dowethics.com/,
http://www.dowindia.com/ and, with a twist,
http://www.mad-dow-disease.com/. Dow continues to play whack-a-mole
with these sites (at least one ISP has received veiled threats).

Burson-Marsteller, the public relations company that helped to "spin"
Bhopal, has meanwhile sued college student Paul Hardwin
(mailto:phardwin@yurt.org) for putting up a fake Burson-Marsteller
site, http://www.bursonmarsteller.com/, which recounted how the PR
giant helped to downplay the Bhopal disaster. Burson-Marsteller's suit
against Hardwin will be heard next week by the World Intellectual
Property Organization (http://reamweaver.com/bmwipo/wipo.html).

Hardwin, unable to afford a lawyer, has composed a dryly humorous
57-page rebuttal to the PR giant's lawsuit
(http://www.reamweaver.com/bmwipo/response.htm#reality). On page 7,
for instance, the student notes that Burson-Marsteller's "stated goal
is 'to ensure that the perceptions which surround our clients and
influence their stakeholders are consistent with reality.'" Hardwin
goes on to assert that his satirical domain is doing precisely that,
by publicizing "academic and journalistic materials about
Burson-Marsteller's involvement with and relationship to, for example,
Philip Morris and the National Smoker's Alliance, a consumer front
group designed to create the appearance of public support for
big-tobacco policies; Union Carbide and the deaths of 20,000 people
following the 1984 disaster in Bhopal; and political regimes such as
that of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and more recently Saudi
Arabia following the events of September 11; and to properly associate
them with the relevant Trademark so that they may be understood
accordingly by Internet users."

In response to the suit's claim that "a substantial degree of goodwill
is associated with [the Burson-Marstellar Trademark]" Hardwin offers
much "evidence to the contrary" including "a newspaper headline in
which the Complainant is characterized as 'the Devil.'"


The primary goal of RTMark (http://rtmark.com/) is to publicize
corporate subversion of the democratic process. Just like other
corporations, it achieves its aims by any and all means at its
disposal. RTMark has previously helped to publicize websites against
political parties (http://rtmark.com/othersites.html#fpo), political
figures (http://www.rtmark.com/bush.html), and entities like the World
Trade Organization (http://www.gatt.org) and the World Economic Forum
(http://www.world-economic-forum.com).

That's exactly what Bob Herbert said yesterday in the New York Times. It
does more good to have Lott stay than it does having him disappear from
public view. The worst thing about all this is that Rove and the White
House have seized upon the opportunity to make Bush look like the kinder,
gentler, compassionate conservative that he is not. Did anyone see footage
from the speech that Bush gave yesterday in Philadelphia.

Meanwhile, in New Jersey, the State Senate made moves to eliminate not
Baraka but the position of Poet Laureate. I also think this is good. The
First Amendment community has been preparing and licking its chops for this
fight, but people had to wait for the court action on behalf of the NJ
State government. Now the action can begin, and I'm very interested in
watching all this play out.  It will certainly keep poetry in the news.

Steven-

As part of the ongoing petition flap, I'd like to address your concerns. You say we live in a racist society, but that black v. white & back gets us nowhere. Correct. The question is, why is this the case?

Is it whitey? Is it the blue-eyed devil, genetically wired to destroy everything it touches? Of course not. Some of my best friends are blue-eyed honkeys.

If Bill Clinton's people really were badass, they would have said, "It's the power structure, stupid!" Of course they wouldn't- being part of the  subjugation that benefitted the few, who happen to be mostly white.

When you saw "white power structure", you saw red. The knee-jerk reaction was to engage the black v. white dichotomy that you know is useless. This is the blueprint for continued dominance. Let us continue to engage in self-defeating rhetoric. African-Americans will continue to be wary of coalition-building with white folks. Whites will bite black backs for the scraps the power structure has thrown them. Nothing changes.

Your initial turn-off to the petition was that you thought you might be part of the "white ruling class" that was railed against. Come on. I have a hard time believing this. The powers-that-be may monitor this list, but I doubt they'd post such a candid message- as themselves, anyway.

Whether you agree with the petition or not, let's be clear. This is not just a black v. white issue. Yes, Codoleeza Rice & Colin Powell are in this Administration. And they play ball w/ the power structure. Baraka on the other hand, was not asked to read at this past inauguration, Clinton's inauguration, & will probably never be asked to read at any inauguration in the near future. And it ain't because he's black. WHO BLEW UP AMERICA isn't feeling THE PULSE OF MORNING, & the power structure isn't feeling Baraka.

Vernon,

OCD comes in many forms. I have the Intrusive Negative Thoughts thing
going, for example, so I would sing the entire song through once, and then
think:

Oh my God! Did I forget anything? What did I forget? Did I leave out a
verse? Oh my God. I have to check. I have to do it all over again to make
sure.

Jingle Bells, Take 2. This time, it's:

Okay, I know I had all the verses in, that was good, that was OH SHIT! The
F sharp in the third measure! I completely fucked up that F sharp!
Everybody's going to know it was me. They're going to think I'm stupid.
They're going to hate me. They're going to think I was trying to commit
blasphemy.

... you see the pattern.

Ok, forget the petition, here's Baraka:

Who do Tom Ass Clarence Work for
Who doo doo come out the Colon's mouth
Who know what kind of Skeeza is a Condoleeza
Who pay Connelly to be a wooden Negro

Now, leaving aside the juvenile playground level of the attack here, the
presumption is that any black person who works for, or even agrees with,
the administration in any way is a "tom," unlike the more authentic black
people who will, of course, agree with Baraka.  I guess I understand the
temptation, and I can see that "tokenism" is a real mechanism that can be
used to help the "powers that be" get away with murder, but I still have
to believe that polarizing and demonizing (and tom-izing too) are part of
the problem rather than the solution.

You said it, Steve. Rice & Powell are key figures in this administration's plans to GET WAY WITH MURDER in the coming war. Baraka gets street & lowdown. But let's be honest. Who's really done the polarizing & demonizing? This regime, before the entire world- or Baraka at the Geraldine Dodge Festival? Let's not pretend if Baraka would just be civil he'd be influencing GW policy. What real unity would be achieved by letting Powell & Rice off the hook.? Their language is palatable- their deeds are foul. Baraka's language is nasty. Who will he have killed in 2003?

You're right, we are talking about murder here and your righteous anger
is entirely justified.  My complaints about language use sound trivial and
fastidious when you hold them up against atrocity and bloodshed.  Baraka's
language wants to get down and dirty and deal with that reality.  And when
you get down to it, I feel righteous anger too--I'd like to see the
bastards who are fucking up the world suffer, made to pay.  But I worry
about that emotion because it can justify anything, including
more and more violence, more and more atrocity.  The problem with the
media representation of the world, or one problem with it, is that it's
always giving us enemies, easy targets, for our violence.  I want poetry
to give me something different.

Well, at least one difference, not offered in defense but just as statement
of fact, is that Baraka has written rather sharp criticism of his own
earlier position, and has been observed violently denouncing anti-Semitism,
while Thurmond and Lott, so far as I've been able to determine from the
public record, have taken the course of simply telling us that we have
misunderstood them --

Kind of a curious thing developing here that may may be related to getting
the language we use out of the old TVthink ruts or may be sensitivities of
poets.  I was originally offended by the joke's on them tone I picked up
originally, but now i see it changing to something like the joke's on us as
we are human.

kind of an early Christmas message even though it comes on Friday, the 13th.

Question, I have a poetry MS ready to send out, some of the work  has
gone over this list... the text is arranged in different directions on
some of the pages so you can read parts backwards, upside down and so
forth...there is a sub text that is in gray tones underneath the rest
of the text... so visually its rich (RTF?), its about 125 pages, any
thoughts on publishers to send it to?

No, but my Word has been acting up too.

Yesterday, when I tried to save a version of an essay, a dialogue box
popped up that said, "This isn't nearly as witty as something Aaron
Beltz could write.  Are you sure you wish to save it?"

I clicked "no."

David, i'm glad you liked the Baraka poem.  i'm not sure if you thought i was saying it was a bad poem or not.  i actually was saying, for the argument that was originally put forth, whether or not it was a good poem was irrelevant.  and i agree with you that that should then lead into WHO THE FUCK gets to say what's a good poem or not?  it's ridiculous really, but i'm guilty of it too of course, but at the same time like to remember that someone out there (maybe even someone other than the poet who wrote the poem) likes it.  i was more concerned with the idea of defending Baraka for writing his poem, and whatever poem he'll write next, for that matter.

but when Baraka was asked to step down from a position because of a poem he wrote, this IS an attempt to censor.  okay, some folks on this list make it clear they don't agree.  but where does the thread of this begin?  or is the question more, where does it end?  to have something taken away from you (even though he hasn't had it taken away, just an attempt) because of a poem written and read aloud before the tender ears of the Dodge Festival, isn't this censorship?

the whole thing's so stupid really when you think of it.  as if Baraka wasn't who he was before, during and after.  as if, upon receiving the chair he would suddenly transform into some sort of polite, grateful asshole who would promise to write only tender poems for cat lovers, or whatever seems appropriate for tea on the right side of the New Jersey tacks.

my point is to defend the voice, no matter who owns it.  either that or we could inform the ACLU of the list of poets who deserve their affections, and fuck the rest.  and by the look of the news, the sooner the better.

Dead all,

A shameless "plug," my excuse being that I participated in making this, =
and my participation was fully literary!

"Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker: The Music Game" is a computer game based on =
-- you guessed right! -- Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. This company that =
I wrote for makes music games based on classical music. The whole =
enterprise is based on the now proprietary (patent-pending) platform =
under which can take any piece of music and scramble it in a particular =
way to make an intriguing computer-based puzzle. And you don't need to =
know notes or have any musical education to solve it -- you unscramble =
it by ear. Meant for ages 4-104.

Check it out at this site:

www.KidsMusicStage.com

There are links to several product reviews on the page -- they are all =
raves. This is the next generation of interactive musical entertainment =
- you haven't seen its like yet! Kids and adults alike fall in love with =
this stuff, and I greatly enjoyed contributing to it.

What was my contribution? I wrote all the voice-over and text that =
appears on the CD, including little rhymed poems for children about =
musical instruments, an educational Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments =
(which explains about 20 instruments!), and all the game rules. I tried =
to write it all as well as I could!

Cheers and season's greetings!

Subject:      Call me anything- i wont deny it; FOR BARAKA
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1; format=flowed

Before anything else i would just want to say, that this email is not an
attempt to add anymore to the discussion that has been going on on and off
since late fall on whether or not Baraka is guilty of feeling guilt for his
art etc. It is definately not trying to take sides either. Rather if
anything, this will be a praise of poetry in itself. Since a prayer for
peace is useless. right?

I just read David Hadbawnik email, and was reminded of the first time i
heard the poem. it was in spring 2001 at haverford college read by the poet
himself. we had quite a few guests that spring, and it was only by chance
that i happened to be there that day. I had never heard the name Baraka. Did
not know the work of the poet, his beliefs, early/late sins, nothing for
that matter. can't say i am particulary intrested in things like that
anyway. I don't care what the poet has to say. Words can speak for
themselves. (the problem is that we are not seldom, bad listeners)

Hearing Baraka read his work was breathtaking, and very empowering. there
were quite a few lovers of the word in the audience that day, and the
message that was sent us to all of us, was that we as poets have a
responsibilty towards life; to keep it alive.
In response to what David wrote;
>it wasn't meant as merely an "anti-semite" or anti-jewish spiel
-- it's
>anti-everything!
yes - or even for-everything. Futher the poem is not about or against
anything. How is it that so many are forgetting that poetry is not about me,
you, s/he, it etc.? ---- I think that Baraka's words, are a cry to us, and
want to serve as a reminder that there are things in this world that will be
extinct if attempts are not made to preserve them. For me that evening the
poem was shouting out that the truth needs protection.

Yes, Baraka's peom is pointing towards something -- yet it is not pointing
out the gulity ones. I am sure you have all heard the expression; when a
finger points to the moon, only a fool looks at the
finger. think of it.

Perhaps there are those of you out there, who just always go out and do
whatever you can for peace, and don't settle for simply a prayer. personally
i am sorry to say that i am not one of those. i get comfortable far too
easily - i have a tendency to get caught up in couging up fiction and more
or less forgetting about the unreal reality out there. (can you blame me...
) Somebody, once told me that nowadays people are so obsessed with the real;
you know constantly checking emails, calling, giving feedback on everything
-  constantly through this conforming eachothers existences: yes sweetheart
rest assured, i am still alive, still real. ---- that in order to find real,
you have to look for the irreal.

anyway, that was sort of a sidenote; i don't mean to digress  ---  so,
listening to Baraka perform his some of his poetry, and to hear him ask of
all of us who love, to love strong - was something that i needed to hear.
Strong voices, that can break through thick walls of indifference and even
forgetfullness, which we are less eager to except because they remind us of
what we would prefer not to think about, that we cannot make out -- are
necessary in today's society. Because there is just never a silence long
enough for us to be able to hear the more subtle sounds. And further we move
too fast, ever to have time to make a note of the less visible, of what is
appearing before us right this minute. We need people who are willing to
crash into other people's faces/lives, simply to make them react or break
out in an expression they have not before confronted. We need people who
come up and flat out tell you i believe in you.

a few poet friends asked me to post this.  through Zia Jaffrey's book THE INVISIBLES a network of poets and other concerned artists has been formed, sharing information about the hijra caste.  the following article is rather sad, but at the same time, may be the very thing to finally get more protection for this underclass of India through international pressures.

investigation into the recent death of a transwoman in india.

>JUSTICE FOR CHANDINI
>
>Chandini alias Nazir, a 22 year old hijra (transgender woman) died
>in mysterious circumstances on the night of December 1, 2002,
>Sunday in Bangalore, India.


>
>On December 4th all English and Kannada newspapers
>sensationalised the death of Chandini. Her death was reported as
>a suicide. The reason given was that she set herself afire because
>her husband Gnanaprakash discovered her hijra identity and
>threatened to reveal it to his parents. They reported that Chandini
>deceived Gnanaprakash by hiding her hijra identity at the time of
>marriage. It is not at all surprising that the police also accepted in
>totality this version of what had happened as supplied by her
>husband.
>
>The following is a brief accounting of the true events as ascertained
>by a fact-finding team comprising of representatives from the
>Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Karnataka; Alternative
>Law Forum (a group of lawyers); Sangama (a sexuality minorities'
>rights group); and Vividha (an autonomous group of sexuality
>minorities).
>
>Chandini hails from Arsikere, Hasan and has been living in
>Bangalore for the past 5-6 years. Gnanaprakash initially met her in
>a hamam (bath houses where hijras live). After a six-month
>relationship and after much persuasion Chandini agreed to marry
>him. They married 16 months ago. There is photographic and
>videographic evidence of the marriage, and of it having been
>attended by many friends of Chandini from the hijra community. A
>week after the marriage, Gnanaprakash accompanied Chandini
>when she decided to go for Nirvan (Castration) in a hospital in
>Cuddapah, Andhra Pradesh. After the operation Chandini and her
>newly wed husband lived at Chandini's Guru (Hijra mother in the
>hijra community) Prema's house, for about a month. Later they
>rented a house in Amrutha Halli, on the outskirts of Bangalore and
>lived together as husband and wife, for 5 months. He was often
>violent towards her and began to harass, beat her and took away all
>the money that she was earning through sex-work. After six
>months of living together unable to bear his constant demands for
>money and to escape his torture, she left for Pune.
>
>Chandini returned to Bangalore on November 7, 2002 and began
>living with her Guru in Amrutha Halli. Gnanaprakash learnt of her
>return to Bangalore and came to her Guru's house. In the absence
>of her Guru he forced her to leave with him. She had on her
>person 60 grams of gold jewellery and Rs. 50,000 in cash when she
>left. Gnanaprakash took her to a rented house in Ramaswami
>Palya (Banaswadi police Station Limit) in Bangalore. He
>deliberately isolated Chandini from her only support, the hijra
>community. She was found dead on the night of December 1,
>2002.
>
>Local police in Banaswadi Police Station initially refused to register
>the complaint of Prema (Chandini's Guru). They in fact said that
>they do not recognise the hijra community or its relationships. They
>said they would act only if Chandini's biological parents issued a
>complaint. They also claimed that they only recovered Rs.5000 in
>cash while investigating Chandini's death.
>
>There are several issues that suggest suspicion of foul play in
>Chandini's death. First, it is obvious from the foregoing that the
>statement of Chandini's husband of being tricked into marriage by
>her is a lie. There is evidence of his having frequented hamams
>from earlier days, and the photographic evidence of the marriage
>clearly shows that he new Chandini was a hijra at the time of
>marriage. Second, there are witnesses to the fact that Chandini was
>brutally treated by her husband, and ran away from him to Pune.
>Third, when Chandini left her Guru's house (under pressure) she
>had with her Rs.50000 and 60 grams of gold, while the police
>claimed to have recovered only Rs.5000.
>
>We do not have much faith in the local police of Banaswadi Police
>Station undertaking an impartial investigation. There bias against
>the hijra community is obvious. There is also the possibility of they
>being offered cash inducement in order not to undertake the
>investigation seriously.
>
>The fact finding committee has spoken to Chandini's parents who
>dispute local police claims of the Rs. 5,000, found with Chandini,
>having been returned to them. They also mentioned that when
>they first saw the dead body of Chandini, she had gold ornaments
>on her which were missing later.
>
>We are starting an email campaign as one of the many ways in

Re: the question as to whether the goodness/badness of the poem is relevant
-- yes, I believe this to be wholly relevant because, were it a well-crafted
poem, the claim that Baraka is calling into question a whole host of
stereotypes and misconceptions, rather than simply runnng down a list of
provocative one-liners, would hold some merit and, as a fellow artist, I
would feel better about rushing to his defense. Instead, I feel somewhat
tricked, as if this is exactly what Baraka hoped would happen (what else
would a Marxist be doing accepting a state appointment anyway?) and the poem
itself becomes wholly irrelevant. Accordingly, a bunch of poets become
engaged in a  distraction which we would very much like to think has to do
with the persecution of artists, etc. (and, were we to look at the race
issue Barrett raised a while back, then we would have a much more salient
issue here, I think) but really just diverts all of us -- Baraka especially
-- from doing anything related to poetry or art. Unless, of course, we are
merely defending the poet's right to say *anything,* (because, in my
reading, there really seems to be no artistic reason whatsoever to make the
statement in question) as some say we are. But then, I think we should stop
pretending this debate any longer has anything to do with poetry at all. As
I said before, I agree that Baraka should not be asked to step down and
there, as on many other occasions, the ADL has crossed the line. What I do
find problematic is the letter's implication that the ADL has fashioned its
objections out of thin air. Baraka did say dangerous and offensive things in
his poem. If the poem was really doing its job, we'd be discussing that,
instead of pretending it didn't happen.

   I think it mite be useful for someone to go back in this discussion...and
cull the dozens of words used to euphemize Baraka's lies..from myths to po
license...we could then compare these myths & licenses to a few centuries of
the rhetoric of white racism....try also Baraka as rhetoritician and inspirer
of the volk  with similiar sentiments about Adolf and Goebbels...

    If this were England or France, Baraka would have been sued for libel, as
David Irving was,  by the ADL and undoubtedly convicted in a civil suit. If
this were Germany he could have quite possibly spent time in jail. Lies are
protected first amendment speech in fascist America and we live with our
freedoms...

    Now that super K & George Mitchell have resigned, isn't Baraka with his
unique extra-ordinary outside sources, the perfect life-long public bureaucrat
to head the 9/11 inquiry. Who who who else...harry..

It should be noted that similar to the gender underclass of india,
there also exists a gender under class here. This is the year that has
seen 25 ("trans")/gender murders (just recently here in California 17
year old), a major count ruling constituting gender as that thing
between the legs - upon birth, and in Colorado *the amendment 2 state*
reversed its decision on id's, mandating surgery for gender
identification changes, reflecting a privileged perceptive of gender
segregation. the same kind of privilege that has gone on for the past
5000 years. Also important to note is that in india, at least one, if
not more Hijras have been elected to a national office, here some
("trans")/gender individual can not even get a proper identification or
employment..... Gender oppression creates a constant underclass world
wide. what can happen here so there are not twenty some murders a year?

As a bona fide mentally ill person, I'd say the last thing anyone in like
condition wants is to be looked at "with sensitivity".  I'd rather be
thought good-looking.
As for good taste, I vote we stamp it out in all quarters and replace it
with increasingly unimpregnable fits of obscurity, accompanied by blaring
sirens, horns and bells.
Better go back to advising on post-terror implementations, Ron; those of us
frothing at the mouth prefer to do so candidly, and without oppressivly
polite preconditions or precautions.Hail to free speech! (& to hell with
Lott, Baraka or those porions of any of our own expression that remain
accusitory yet inactive.

context is everything...i've seen this joke in a number of contexts,
and it's usually people who suffer from these illnesses taking the
opportunity to laugh at themselves.  you know, like the difference
between "anti-Semitic" jokes and Jewish jokes as lovingly told by
Freud in Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious, which is
basically a love-letter to the institution of the Jewish joke.

I hope so.  That Geoff--one of the kindest people I've known--should be so
linked is laughable.  Some also there might be who resent the term "mental
illness."  I know someone who suffers from manic-depression, and he thought
the jokes were pretty funny.  But that's because he doesn't see himself as
aberrant.  Consider that every time we create another exaggerated
"sensitivity zone" we underline someone's alienated status.  Dehumanizing,
I'd say.  PC gone wacko, if you'll forgive the clinical
terminology--producing precisely the opposite of what it intends.  Hell, life
kicks all our bubble asses one way or the other.  No harm in laughing.

The idea of a laureate is pretty odd in a democracy. In the not so old days
there was a Librarian of Congess (and only federal, I think), whose job was
precisely the same. The change in title is further evidence, if one needed
it, of the ascendancy of the imperial presidency.

I never had much use for librarianships of Congress either, but the title
had at least the virtue of making it clear that it was a job, however
cushy. It still is, under its new name, and a job is not a grant--one can
get fired from a job for embarrassing one's boss. Which is not the same as
censorship.

Granted NJ hired the wrong guy if they were worried about being
embarrassed. But Baraka was also a party to the contract--he had to know
that as an employee he had given up some of the freelancer's freedom.

David, i'm glad you liked the Baraka poem.  i'm not sure if you thought i

argument that was originally put forth, whether or not it was a good poem
was irrelevant.  and i agree with you that that should then lead into WHO
THE FUCK gets to say what's a good poem or not?  it's ridiculous really,
but i'm guilty of it too of course, but at the same time like to remember
that someone out there (maybe even someone other than the poet who wrote
the poem) likes it.  i was more concerned with the idea of defending Baraka
for writing his poem, and whatever poem he'll write next, for that matter.

but when Baraka was asked to step down from a position because of a poem he
wrote, this IS an attempt to censor.  okay, some folks on this list make it
clear they don't agree.  but where does the thread of this begin?  or is
the question more, where does it end?  to have something taken away from
you (even though he hasn't had it taken away, just an attempt) because of a
poem written and read aloud before the tender ears of the Dodge Festival,
isn't this censorship?

the whole thing's so stupid really when you think of it.  as if Baraka
wasn't who he was before, during and after.  as if, upon receiving the
chair he would suddenly transform into some sort of polite, grateful
asshole who would promise to write only tender poems for cat lovers, or
whatever seems appropriate for tea on the right side of the New Jersey tacks.

my point is to defend the voice, no matter who owns it.  either that or we
could inform the ACLU of the list of poets who deserve their affections,
and fuck the rest.  and by the look of the news, the sooner the better.

many interesting things are being said on this list on this subject.
in re this post, i agree w/ that the characterization of the ADL is
ahistorical.  I'm no fan of the ADL but they are a watchdog
organization for anti-Semitism, and that should be kept in mind.
on the other hand, i do not agree that a poem should have to be
"good" --determined by whom, by the way?  even this group of experts
evinces a wide range of opinions on the matter --in order to merit
protection and defense.  Though your explanation of your position is
thoughtful and persuasive, in general i see meritocracy as a big
problem in the poetry world.
In re someone's earlier post about the word "Semitic," I agree that
the word has come to mean something very specific --i.e. Jewish
--when the it has a broader meaning.  However, while i don't believe
this is what the poster (can't remember whom) intended, one could
construe her intervention as meaning that if the word "anti-Semitic"
*only* applied to Jews, anti-Semitism would be okay.  This is, of
course, anti-Jewish, if not "anti-Semitic."

"Many poets want you to
write just like them,
only not as well."
    --Jonathan Williams

Kristin, you say if Baraka's poem "was really doing its job, we'd be discussing that, instead of pretending it didn't happen."  Have you been reading the e-mails since your last post?  There are at least two poets who feel very passionate about that poem.  And I'm sure there are plenty of others out there who the poem MORE than did its job for.

But maybe these poets really DON'T like Baraka's poem?  Maybe they've been FOOLING themselves?  Maybe they need to pay closer attention to YOU, since you know SO much about what every poet in the world should KNOW about WHAT is a "good poem."

By the way, there's quite a bit of invention in your e-mail, stating that Baraka may have planned the whole thing.  How do you know this?  You say you feel "tricked."  Where's your evidence for this one?  You REALLY don't believe that Baraka was being Baraka when he wrote/read this poem for the world?

You act as if this whole thing is SO BORING for you to even be bothered with, yet you keep insisting that if he were a "better poet" that MAYBE you'd trouble yourself to defend his RIGHT to speak!

Well, like I said before, why don't you make yourself a Christmas list for the ACLU of poets YOU feel are WORTHY of their protection.  The rest can just fuck themselves I guess?  Freedom of Speech is only a matter of taste afterall.

SO SORRY TO BORE YOU,

I didn't think the jokes about diagnostic categories were at all laugh out
loud funny, but I also didn't think they were all that offensive either.
This may result from the fact that I am constantly asked to diagnose and
after more than 20 years of this have come to think the DSM IV
categorization of human conflict and suffering while being officially
necessary is not always that specific, substantial or useful. Perhaps the
jokes were as much aimed at the emptiness of these diagnoses as they were at
the people who suffer from them, and that most of us experience some
combination of such syndromes at one time or another. But even then, the
jokes were not that funny.  And indeed there are many who suffer from
intense forms of such syndromes. Yet I think it is a stretch to compare this
kind of joking with Trent Lott's comments supporting segregationist policies
and why Mr. Thurmond would have made a great president, or with Amiri
Baraka's harsh poem. Charles Bernstein once made the point that -If you
can't joke, you can't talk.- Still, your question about good taste and
sensitivity towards others on the list is valuable and important and I am
glad that you have raised it. Some debates on this list occasionally, and
mercifully, not all that often, seem to give some list members a feeling of
being entitled to become abusive on the behalf of whatever is their point of
view. To become enraged and or frightened and outraged gives some people the
idea that they should and must become voluble and abusive. Enlightened
protest, of course, should try to exemplify values of maturity and
rationality because such values are usually what the protester feels are
lacking in the policies they are protesting against. On the other hand, when
someone is trying to break out of a tortured silence, occasionally they
cross over the line of fairness towards their opponent. So it seems to me
that the question becomes, what does one do to be heard in a culture where
no one pays much attention or listens to calmly made arguments and the model
for rational debate and argument is Chris Matthews' -Hardball-?

It seems to me that if I acknowledge my true ambivalence on many if not most
issues I discover some humor about them that enables me to try to temper my
viewpoint. On the other hand, there has to be some internal process that can
lead me at crucial moments to take a strong stand. My experience in many
social and formal situations where discussions take place is that the
loudest and most persistent voice wins. This gradually shuts up everybody
else and eventually the strident people come to represent the rest of us.

You know I always get myself into trouble at Christmas
parties shattering the idealistic remembrance some
party-goer had of intellectual moments in high school
or college by suggesting that "Romeo and Juliet" is a
very funny play, probably intended as farce, and that
Shakespeare probably rectified the problem of audience
mis-reading of the play as romance by redoing it, less
subtly as "Pyramus and Thisbe" within Midsummer
Night's Dream.

Nick and Ron,
    You raise an issue here that hits me in the keyboard as I type:  "When I
(or you) post to a list do I do so as a person or poet or psychologist or?
I'm still thinking this through but have gotten into a lot of 'trouble'
posting to a health bb as a poet and as a psychologist and I suspect that
often my posts here may be overanalyzed due to my title.  Even on the
internet it is difficult to shed the robes?

There is also, I think, a distincion to be made in posting here to a poetics
list and posting here poetically.  On the bb I've begun to preface all my
comments by saying something like: "Poetically speaking,..."
"Psychologically speaking,...." or "As a sufferer, I say..."

Maybe we could uselist 'avatars'

As you noted, though, Nick, if jokes are to be posted they should be good
ones and if someone is to post poetically to a poetics list it should be a
good poetic response (not necessarily rhymed!).  This, of course, raises the
quetion of what a 'good poetic' response to mental illness, reactions to
mental illness, our latest war, etc. is?

Dear Ron,

It has been my own personal experience of mental illness (I have six
comorbid diagnoses) that sometimes it *must* be laughed at in order to
diminish its power. Otherwise, it's incredibly easy to give up in the face
of the damn thing.

This Christmas-carol list has been floating around the Internet for
several years, as has the "psychiatric hotline" meme, and I get a giggle
out of each one as they float by, precisely because they do contain
nuggets of truth.

I find your "Lott" comparison more than a tad overblown, I'm afraid. Is
anyone on this 900-member list in a position of power sufficient to
systematically and wide-rangingly oppress the mentally ill?

Gwyn McVay

Tom,

look at the Teachers and Writers Collaborative on-line workshops. I know
that they are intended for students k-12 but I've found them to be good
starts for students of all ages.

also, for me i tend to dump a big pile of books on the table in kind of a
pre-emptive strike. "look how much of this stuff there is!" Solt's
Concrete anthology is always a big hit.

cheers,
kevin

Ron, as someone who was forced doses of lithium as a kid by my state-appointed DoctorMonster, I feel justified saying a sense of humor is NOTHING short of GLORIOUS!  Imagine if Plath had looked in the mirror and BURST out laughing the morning she mistook her head for a rack of ribs?

Okay, when I was depressed it wasn't so funny, but maybe funny is JUST the thing I needed?  They're SO friggon serious when you show up at the office, yikes!

"Bad taste?"  I've tried SO HARD to figure out "good taste" but I break out in HIVES.  Maybe I'm allergic to "good taste," oh dear.  I mean, I didn't get hives at Thanksgiving, but then again I was up half the night playing Black Jack with my mother, cussin' and smokin' and doing shots of Wild Turkey with her.  OH MAMA!

Recently someone (who was that?  can't remember) on the list dusted off their violin and moaned a tune that went something like, "Maybe this list is over?  Maybe this list is dead?"  I BURST out laughing imagining all the DECENT poet-folk RUNNING to the mountains with their respectable brands of luggage, leaving this list to the DEVIANTS, WACKOS, and assorted HEATHEN SCUM!

There's a drum-roll every time the freon settles in the hair behind the music.  Ooo, ooo, hear it?  I'm a vegetarian, otherwise I'd be gnawing a pile of bones while typing this love letter to you all.

GO OUT LAUGHING!

Well, I have severe mental illness and I joke about it a lot.  But it may be
a case of Black people beomg allowed to say nigger, or something.  Anyway, I
don't make fun of the behavior of mentally ill people or of individual
mentally ill people, I joke about the phenomena.  The classic joke was
actially not mine; my schizophrenic ex said it.  We had been trying to be
very understanding about his voices and it had apparently backfired, so one
morning we were in bed and the neighbors started to have a fight and it was
annoying me.  I complained to my ex, "those damn neighbors and their
arguments!"  He replied, not missing a beat, "I know the voices are very
real to you...  would you like some risperidone?"

I also joke a lot about things I did when manic and otherwise sick with
other crazy people, whome I refer to as such and did with the group of
people involved.  But we knew full well that mental illmess was no laughing
matter. We called ourselves the Lunatic Fringe and heped each other and got
up to minor trouble with each other (very minor, like removing an apostrophe
on a sign which purported to rent VIDEO'S in huge letters, and adding our
own sign saying that the apostrophe had been removed by the SSSA -- The
Society for the Suppression of Spurious Apostrophes.  Underneath was a
helpful explanation stating that apostrophes are used to indicate posessives
and the plurals require only the letters 's' or 'es' or other endings for
certain words.)

One of us was always getting taken to the hospital by the others, and our
ambition was to get a padded VW microbus and equip it as the fringemobile
ambulance for taking people to the bin (which we called the bin).  The
silliness  stopped however when something went wrong.

When we got to the hospital, we were very matter of fact and professional
about the whole thing: so and so was taking XYZ meds, ceased medicaation on
or around date, began to have symptoms ABC, now requires hospitalization
because of danger to self because she bought a rope and chose a tree, or ODd
on x# of Y pills and was treated a emergency room K and relased.  I always
was chosen to do the talking because I knew how to sound like one of THEM
(actually, I ended up working as a counselor in a psych residence, so I
guess I really did have the seeds of one of Them) and I was all business, no
emotion.  Only if there was a problem did I starte to say things like "we're
afraid to have her home because she attacked us" "I can't take
responsibility" "put that in writing" "if you think she'll be fine what are
you going to do about the fact that she came over and broke my window?" etc.

But basically I agree wholeheartedly.  Making fun of us is not cool, it's
just like making fun of Blacks or or Jews, which is quite out of style these
days.  (And I mean out of style.  I don't think we have gotten more moral
over the years, it's just that different groups are considereed "protected"
and in fashion not to harass, while others can be harassed and made fun of.
For example, we are alowed to make fun of the English -- including mocking
individual English people's manners and accent, or of the Germans, or of the
Japanese.  But not Blacks, Jews, or Asian-Americans.  Or retarded people,
but menatlly ill people are fair game.  Someone ought to study this.  Not
why individual groups are in and out --  the historical reasons are not too
hard to see -- but why we feel compelled to make fun of some groups of
people and why it is considered acceptable.  Granted, we aren't likely to
seriously discriminate against the British however we may mock them, but we
do discriminate against mentally ill folk.

The attitude we espouse as a group oppressed the mentally ill, as part of
society's attitude. In my first reponse, I rather carefully exmplained the
kind of joking around the illness I do.  The kind I don't do is make the
idea of mental illnesses "funny" as this rather unfunny joke purports to do.
It is not funny to have manic depression or schizophrenia.  It is definitely
not funny to be paranoid.  Moreover, people with OCD might joke about their
condition, even if it is crippling (part of the definition of OCD is that
the poerson is aware that , logicaly, the rituals and checking don't make
sense but they must do them anyway-- this distinguishes it from a more
psychotic version of similar behavior), but people with paranoia and
schizophrenia are usually embarrassed to be ill and find paranoia to be a
very scary subject.  Not a funny one.  Moreover the joke would not make
sense to them, but they would see that they are targeted.  I know this from
contect with a schizophrenic friend and the answering machine joke -- and he
was high functioning and able to read difficult books, but nit able to "get"
jokes -- that is one of the specific disabilities in schizophrenia.

I also think mental illness can be funny to people who are diagnosed with a
mental illness but are part of society, like grad students and professors,
and recognized writers (I'm talking about this list) and even computer
people and bankers and insurance salespeople.  But for those such as myself,
who are JUST mentally ill, ie who are totslly disabled, on disabilty, and
living with parents or in a project for the elderly and handicapped on a
fixed income, mental illness is a tragedy.  If we are on this list, likely,
at one time our lives had other apparent directions.  We probably seemed
promising and likely to do well.  Instead, we will live and die as mental
petients.  This just isn't funny.

I want to thank Ron for making his point.  And I have a lot of humor about
mental illness.  Half my web site ( www.sporkworld.org ) is devoted to it.
I have a cartoon character called Spork the Schizophrenic Skua who has
adventures in the mental health system in cartoons, and in a Spork York
Times newspaper.  Then some of my small epoetry works (really csrtoons or
animations but they are under epoetry on my site) are about a a fictional
"Finkel Center For Psychoanalysis" (these can be seen on the current
hyperrhiz at www.rhizomes.net, under "current issue" the choose hyperrhiz
which is at the end -- my Flash work is featured as one of five artists and
I have the Finkel Center pieces there) -- this is joking about mental
illness issues.  Mostly though, I joke about the system, not about the
people.  I also have a joking but serioous hypertext called Bedlam, under
webworks on my site, and a very serious but funny to the initiate (alas)
site called Suicide (undet webworks) which is a documentary type thing
(though not about an attempt -- it's about suicidality in three women with
bipolar disorder including me. and it has some interactive content and some
stuff that isn't personal -- meant to be an artistic exploration of suicide)

Dear Ron,

It has been my own personal experience of mental illness (I have six
comorbid diagnoses) that sometimes it *must* be laughed at in order to
diminish its power. Otherwise, it's incredibly easy to give up in the face
of the damn thing.

This Christmas-carol list has been floating around the Internet for
several years, as has the "psychiatric hotline" meme, and I get a giggle
out of each one as they float by, precisely because they do contain
nuggets of truth.

I find your "Lott" comparison more than a tad overblown, I'm afraid. Is
anyone on this 900-member list in a position of power sufficient to
systematically and wide-rangingly oppress the mentally ill?

To Ron Millie Chris and Fellow Sufferers (Joke).=20

I think just about everyone has some experience of mental illness OR =
they know someone.  I personally know of three people who have committed =
suicide fairly recently and we all know the young man....look I'm always =
doing that -  I've blanked on his name (dammit) - so I think your point =
is relevant. We have to be tolerant. Both to those who are so tormented =
and to the non - PC people!  PC can be a problem yet we need rules etc =
as you and everyone knows....we've all committed faux pas.

I would make some tired joke at this point about poets all being mad but =
there's the other fairly common one about "every one being paranoid =
except me" and variations; its the context that counts here as you =
know...I'm using you as a sounding board Ron hope you dont get bored by =
it (sorry)...as someone else has said... (context I mean)

I made  a comment about the Mafia to some Italian guy on the internet =
ches club I'm on and I thought I'd  never hear the end of it.... and yet =
the next day one sees  "outrageous" comments on some other non PC thing =
or subject....=20

DIVIGATION COMING ON!

[}} Yesterday a woman I know asked a couple of young Jordanian men =
immediatley after being introduced if they were terrorists !!!! I must =
admit that was  bit funny if potentially dangerous and potentially rude =
hence hurtful depending on the person's reality or response...but these =
guys were one of these ONLY:

either a) were terrorists and liked the unconscious humour/macabre =
nature/aspect  of the situation

b) wernt and thought it is was amusing=20

c) wernt but wernt offended because they were cool modern "illuminated" =
type coca cola drinking arabs (intelligent and very sophisticated and =
MODERN I mean of course)

d) were terrorists and were NOT amused and are plotting the woman's =
death!!! (and possibly mine as well into the bargain)

e) were totally baffled as their English is poor (a it seemed to be)  !=20

e2) were none of the above and in fact were CIA agents and enjoyed the =
"double" humour of that fact

d) were none of the above and we'll never know what they thought

g) were none of the above=20

z) were all of the above

PLEASE, please...  (Choose from a) to d) just tick ONE... PLEASE be sure =
not to tick two letters simultaneously) }}]

I think PC by and large is a good thing but it like everything else it =
can be used for overthumping people and for getting too humourless....

That said it is a difficult area and as (are we all mature...I feel like =
a kid sometimes!?): its like the  "Baraka Problem" ..some people are =
seeing his 4000 thing as rabid anti-Jewish and yet some Jewish people =
are loving the poem: some people hate Baraka, others feel he was right =
...he makes us uncomfortable: I feel he's ok as its contextualised in =
his Blow Up America Poem...as to mental illness: may be we "should " be =
more sensitive to mentally ill people....

For example, I mean: I think that all women are mentally ill - but that =
excludes my mother, my grand mothers, my daughters, my sister, my =
girlfriends...what girlfriends!!!??!

Ahhhhhhh!!!!     Just got attacked by an RWP ( Radical Woman =
Poet).....Ahhhhhhhhhh,.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... good byyeeeeee......ahhhh =
h h .... =
j.........jhh.......hhh......................h...........................=
ooooooooooo...............

Here I was just this week trying to find out Garrett Kalleberg was (after
just having read his stunning _Some Mantic Daemons_, a result of a
completely random book purchase at St. Marks--I like the cover, I say
without shame, and I also liked the poem I read at random from it while in
the store).  Quite at the same time I was trying to ask my poet-friends who
he is, out of nowhere, my close friend Giles Hendrix (who, other than being
my dear dear friend & creative collaborator on proximate.org, did video for
me at Duke U's Blackburn Festival and also at the Segue reading I
participated in a few weeks back) sends me this email...see below.

It seems that this Situation Room still has one more showing to go this
weekend.  If I lived anywhere nearby I'd be sure to check it out.

And it also turns out Garrett runs a web journal (Transcendental Friend)
that recently published some of Araki Yasusada's new work.

It's a small world indeed.

Go on, Garrett, whoever you are.  Go on!

Executive Director: Garrett Kalleberg
Producer: Patrick Daniels
Director: Ted MacLeod

Theater of the absurd's timely and eminently rational answer to a
1963 declassified CIA memo re: releasing firebomb-fitted fruit bats
over enemy enclaves - it's pro-us, anti-them, right? An eternal
bureaucratic cycle of violence and protocols with no exterminating
angel, THE SITUATION ROOM is a new, dark comedy for six actors.
Condemned to repetition, they cling to roles, rules and procedures in
an effort to endure, if not give sense to, their experience.

A preliminary announcement for....


PALACE OF REPTILES

a new book by Maggie O'Sullivan

forthcoming from The Gig, February 2003


PALACE OF REPTILES is the long-awaited followup volume to British poet
Maggie O'Sullivan's _In the House of the Shaman_ (Reality Street, 1993), a
book widely acclaimed among readers of experimental poetry on both sides of
the Atlantic.  Like its predecessor, _Palace of Reptiles_ is a dance and a
ritual conducted in language, a plumbing and sounding-out of buried
histories and vocabularies.  Ranging from the brief and beautiful "Ellen's
Lament" to the central long poem "DOUBTLESS", the eight poems included in
this book touch on multiple genres (elegy, celebration, performance art,
poetics talk) in order to transform them.  _Palace of Reptiles_ confirms
O'Sullivan as one of the most compelling poets now writing.

*

"O'Sullivan's work forces recognition of points of intersection between
bardic traditions and the defamiliarizing practices of an avant-garde. ...
O'Sullivan's poems embrace the oral, aural, visual, and sculptural qualities
of language and include mangled and fractured words as well as dialect,
slang, and archaisms abutting noncewords and loanwords. ... It is hard to
imagine a poetic practice more invested in the polyvalent, physical
properties of language, or one for which paraphrase is a more futile task."
(Keith Tuma, introduction to the selection of O'Sullivan's work in
_Anthology of Twentieth-Century British & Irish Poetry_, OUP, 2001)

"O'Sullivan's writings have a truly inimitable agenda...which moves
through language towards both musical and painterly arenas and the freedom
with which this is achieved suggests an immense disenfranchisement of the
ideological content of language in favour of its raw physique...  ...the
movement of the text is given an acute physical agenda: intensively
condensed and punctuated lines present obstacles to advancement; as they are
lifted we are rushed back into the effluvia of a hand-made lexicon.  This
procedure articulates a widening and intensifying of analogous muscular
activity: running, stumbling, breaking, stifling, releasing; all of which
can also be felt through the presencing--in its inflections and
gesturings--of a voice. ...this is a poetry of breathing, of continuance
along its sinuous sequentialism.  Its libidinal quality of wilful
postponement affords endurance, an economy of the last word..."
(Aaron Williamson, reviewing _In the House of the Shaman_ in _Parataxis_ 6)

*

intersting - throw it at them and they throw back?  connects to the physical
and play I think important in what they call 'experimental' in the academy.

anyone have any info
on the number of poetry books
published per year
in the US
from say 1900 to now
and how that relates to say fiction or other books

also, perhaps how such growth relates to population:
are there still more poetry books being published now if we factor in
population growth?? what about literacy rates etc.
just wonderin' if anyone knows off hand

--noah



Also, if you know anyone in Western MA, here's a great course offered for
the next semester at UMass:




ENGLISH 291A
Contemporary Poetry

Define contemporary as writing from the present—or near present—all the
books we will be reading were published since the turn of the millennium. By
contemporary we will also mean the ways in which these poets handle language
and experience. It has been almost a century, now, since Ezra Pound
proclaimed, “Make it new.” We will look at how each of these poets, in their
own way makes it new. Readings include: Anselm Berrigan, Bernadette Mayer,
Eileen Myles, Alice Notley, John Yau and more, plus recent issues of various
poetry magazines. Course work includes weekly writing exercises, one short
presentation and a final paper. For more information or a complete reading
list contact instructor by email. 3 credits. $150 per credit.

1.

I did not just THINK about painting out the apostrophe.  NOW I think
(remininsce) about having done it.  I really did this, with two fellow
"sufferers" (the word sufffering, must, in this context, be taken somewhat
liberally -- they had both suffered a lot, bot we fully enjoyed the
apostrophe escapade).  This place was open late, and their sign was only out
when they were open and it was on a busy sidewalk, so this mission was
fraught with danger.  We brought to the scene of the crime: a bottle of
White Out correction fluid, a tube of white paint in case that didn't work,
a paintbrish, a pr drawn laminated (with scotch tape) sign asserting that
the action had been undertaken by the SSSA (Society for the Suppression of
Spurious Apostrophes) with a brief grammatical lesson on it, and a roll of
wide, clear tape for affixing said sign to wall of store in difficult to
remove manner.

Approaching the scene of the crime, we noticed that there were so many teen
age druggies on the street (this was in Providence, RI, on Thayer St.) that
no one would notice us if we clustered together.  It would just look like we
were doing a deal or sharing a joint.  So we clustered, and tried the White
Out.  Alas-- you could see the apostrophe straight through it.
Disappointed, we waited for it to dry and then romoved the apostrophe with
white paint.  There was nothing we could do about the unfortunate space
between VIDEO and S but at least they were no longer renting VIDEO'S...

The sign remained for three weeks, through rain and wind.  Our hand done
lamination and affixing had been effective.  We had even chosen a method
(tape extending around the sign) that would not damage the house by leaving
pieces of paper stuck to it, as gluing would have.  This was the historic
house neighborhood, though marred by establishments catering to teenyboppers
and the Brown University students (which we officially were), and we didn't
want to commit "real vandalism."

The SSSA was engaged in other less drmatic efforts.  It erased many
apostrophes on chalk board menus in ice cream places and restaurants.  In
the case of spurious apostrophes in printed menus, it made phone calls to
restaurants as follows:

"Montana's may we hekp you? [note: this is a ghastly restaurant.  Do not eat
there.  Eat at one of the Asian (Cambodian masquerading as Thai/Vietnamese)
places instead.  Providence was a refugeee dumping place for Hmong]"

"Yes.  Thus is the SSSA calling, we are the Society for the Suppression of
Spurious Apostrophes,  We are a grammar watchdog group, and we have been
monitoring menus around Providence which have apostrophes in the wrong
places.  Well, we have found several in in your menu and we'd like you to
corrrect them, otherwise, we will have to pubklicize this...."

[clunk]

The Ice Cream places actually did erase their apostrophes on their chalk
menus because of our call...

Soon, though, the girl who actually made the calls -- I always thought if
these things but never wanted to do them myself, either because I was too
shy or too law abiding, depending on what the latest manic scheme was -- was
ODing again, always at the least opportune moment =like when I hired her to
do data entry on a grant proposal I was doing for the math department, it
was the day before it was due, and I was writing the final proposal awaiting
her data, and she emailed me repeatedly saying how many pills she had taken
thus far until I had to stop working and make sure she got to an ER...  So
all isn't happy apostrophe killing in the land of the manic depressive.

Also,  I am not really like that.  I am rather more serious by nature.  The
years in which I acted that way were an aberration of my character and I
could not do intellectual work and had to quit grad school (in math, when I
had been a brilliant undergrad, proving new theorems and getting thanked in
people's papers and authoring two math publications myself).  At the time, I
was devastated, and wanted to be able to concentrate on work.  I didn't
understand why I did things like found the SSSA instead.  (Which lasted all
of three weeks, but I had schemes after that and before that).

The meds I was on didn't work at all and mostly I was not beig silly, I was
terribly, suicidally, depressed.  Which has no humorous aspect except for
one -- you start telling your story to someone else who has been THERE and
when you get to lying in bed all the time living on corn flakes eaten out of
the box (in bed) they say, "YOU did the CORNFLAKES too?"  Apparently,
everyone who is so horribly depressed that they won't get out of bed to eat
and can barely shop (shopping is done after midnight to avoid people -- one
is usually paranoid when this far gone -- people are always chasing you, in
reality your friends and family wanting tio help but they can't help, no one
can and you need to be alone and you feeel pursued and it makes you
psychotic (so if someone you know gets that depressed, don'e chase them and
try to have a conversation.  Instead,try t make sure they are eating and
especially drinking.  Try to find them better food than cornflakes to eat in
bed, but don't make them eat it with you there if they want to be alone) --
does CORNFLAKES.  I find this quite funny.  There are a zilion things you
could eat, and yet I've run into the cornflakes again and again.  And I
thought I was the only one to descend to such lows...  other items include
bags of Hershey's Kisses (even if in normal states ine eschews chocolate),
orange juice (the universal OD drink, another weird covergence), rice
cakes...

2.  Everyone has a mental illness is a silly thing to say.  That's like
saying everyone has a little cancer (technically true, everyone has cells
which divide improperly that the immune system gets rid of and which would
cause cancer if for some reason the immune system didn't work)  Or like
saying, everyione has a little bit of pneumonia becuase the common cold is
caused by the same germ, and most people have the common cold at some time
in their lives.

The DSM efinitions are silly in many ways, but one thing they say in alll
the mental illness definitions, is that the symptoms must _substantially
impair functioning_ in at least two speheres (out of work, education, social
life, I think ther may be another).  In other words, people with
diagniosable mental illness can't work normally or can't finishe school in a
normal setting (this applies ti children, not grad students, many of whol
don't finish, athough I certainly quit for mental illness reasons), or, most
importantantly for those "normal folk I run into who say "I have a mentakl
illness, too, I understnad" when they are married and have a job, _can't
function normally in a social situation_.  Not as in, "oh, that person's
eccenric!  He must be an srtist..." but rather as in "What's wrone with that
guy?  Is he really allowed out on his own?"  Or the person doesn't act too
weird but can't actually understand what the conversation was about, who the
people are, what they may be feeling etc (often true in schizophrenia).  Or
the perso repons to voices he hears in addition to what is actually said in
the converstaion (this has happened to me.  Not socially, but I hear voices
in hospitals for some reason, and I mostly am aware of this but sometimes
accidentally talk back to one because I thiik it's real.)

3.  I am not in the slightest PC.  For example, calling us mentally ill is
officially not PC.  We have a neurobiological brain disorder (NBD). To me
that sounds godawaful, and I'd never want to talk to anyone who had that in
case it was catching or something or involved viscous goo leaking out of
hole in their head, but that's the official PC term, if you can believe it.
NAMI (the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a huge lobbying and
grassroots organization, has changed all its literature to use NBD.  I wrote
them a letter saying I am mentally ill and the NBD is imprecise as it would
seem to cover stroke, alzheimer's, cerebral palsy, and a host of other
unlreated disorders for whch NAMI does not lobby.  They answered me (I was
an employee and activist in the organization), but only by sying that their
focus groups showed consumers preferred to say they had an NBD than that
were mentally ill.  Also "consumers"  - that one I have gotten used to
although it's highly silly and hardly seems PC to ME-- doctors and
therapists are the providers of mental health services, while we are the
consumers.  This is PC because it implies choice (in the free market
sense -- actually it's not a free market thing since most of us have to go
to assgned menatkl health centers in our catchment areas under medicaid) as
if we were customers looking for a VCR, rather than sick peeople tryijg to
find a doctot to make us better.  We are supposed to be happy to no longer
be patients or clients.  (I personally propose "employers" as in the
employers of mental health professionals, who after all, are consultants we
hire.  But that'a what "client" meant and it didn't work-- however emoplyer
has more of a focus on the ill person as the ultimate boss of his doctor,
whim he can fire at at will.)  But "consumer" has really taken hold, so
that, for example, the newspaper I write/edit for is "A consumer journal of
mental health" [or would be if we didn't have so few artucles that we have
to snitch them from ither sources] etc.

PCism in general is a waste of time.  Black people benefited from being
treated like equal human beings (to the extent that they actually are-- I
don't think blacks are equally treated, especially not in the sense of being
equally viewed by the public now, so there is a lot more to be done)  But
that could have happened even if they were still "Colored people" or
"Negroes."  Blacks aren't actually black (except for some racial groups in
Africa) anyway, so the new term isn't improved accuracy, it's an attempt to
erase stigma by renaming.  But if you hate Negroes, you are going to hate
Black people just as much and hate African-Americans too. For the people who
weren't racist, it didn't matter what they were called.

Some groups have names which at their origin were terms of sbuse, and I can
understand their chnaging the name, but that's slightiy different -- not
wanting to be a "spic" but rather "Latino" makes some sense since spic was
always a term of abuse, and to sime people "Hispanic" and Spic have the same
feel.  That's why Chinese people object to being called Chinks and so forth,
and why Blacks object to "nigger" (but I think it is the ultimate horrid
pCism to not be allowed to use this word in art, as something a charcater
might say, for example, or in a poem, or to have to write it n------ or say
"the N word" ; it's been a long time since I forced myself to call the F
word the F word rather than just plain "fuck" and that is an offensive word,
too.  But you can use it, with care)  which unlike colored person has a
reason to be eradicated s a term for referring to real people or to blacks
in general in one's own voice -- it was a word created for the purpose of
hurting Black people (history says otherwise, it says it was initially
neutral; but for a long time it has been a term of abuse, back into slavery
days)

You know, Tom, I'm not altogether in agreement with this characterization of
what I said or meant to say in my recent post on -Question.- For some time
I've been uncomfortable with the notion of "good" and "bad" poetry. For
example, what would be good or bad meditation, contemplation, free
association or prayer? Perhaps instead of good or bad I would characterize
certain invocations to destructiveness as problematic, particularly when
they are apparently out to be mean and to provoke or incite violence, but
I do tend to understand poetry as a way of thinking aloud, a kind of
-thought experiment- as opposed to an -aesthetic object-. Of course, this is
where the issues of free speech, private language and free association come
in. It seems to me that as a living thing, poetry is out to discover the
sources of revelation, transformation. Then, as a dry husk or monument of
such efforts some poetry survives as an object of admiration and respect,
and even continued pleasure and insight for succeeding generations -like
that of Blake or Rumi or Langston Hughes or Emily Dickenson.- But I am
concerned about the unchecked use and particularly the escalation of harsh
words, particularly here on the poetics list where they can be read and
reread by those who could potentially feel or be hurt by them, and also
there is the question of embarrassing list members who are regular
contributors or readers. With humor, of course, one must always take the
risk of offending someone or there would never be any jokes at all. "Say
that with a smile on your face, cowboy."

One of my all time favorite comments was made by Henry James: -There are
three things to remember about life. To be kind, to be kind, and to be
kind.-

Still, as a group, we can't -and probably won't- just stand by and let some
people bully other people around.

Nick

i am so glad to see someone else finally challenging the value of the
concept of "good" and "bad" poetry.  it's so limiting in terms of
what one can do with poetry and the poetic.  this is a terrific post.
last night had a conversation w/ some formalists (at my mother's
annual xmas open house) who said, why would anyone read poetry for
anything other than its technical virtuosity?  it was not a
rhetorical question but genuine.  but poetry has all kinds of uses
and non-uses in people's lives.

Hi all, I don't particularly want t wade into this most recent Baraka
thread, which hasn't seemed to me terribly productive, but I did think it
might be useful to post a poem of Baraka's from the 60s - "The Liar" -
which has which has resonated for me during the whole controversy. I
myself have never read Baraka for "the facts" but rather for the complex
clash between psychological, social and aesthetic worlds the poms enact.

************************
THE LIAR

What I thought was love
in me, I find a thousand instances
as fear. (Of the tree's shadow
winding around the chair, a distant music
of frozen birds rattling
in the cold.
                Where ever I go to claim
my flesh, there are entrances
of spirit.  And even its comforts
are hideous uses I strain
to understand.
                Though I am a man
who is loud
on the birth
of his ways.  Publicly redefining
each change in my soul, as if I had predicted
them,
        and profited, biblically, even tho
        their chanting weight,
                                erased familiarity
                                from my face.
                                                A question I think,
an answer; whatever sits
counting the minutes
                        till you die.
                                        When they say, "It is Roi
                                        who is dead?" I wonder
                                        who will they mean?

Justices Call on Bench's Bard to Limit His Lyricism

December 15, 2002
By ADAM LIPTAK






May a jurist rule in verse, if he's dignified and terse?

Or are some texts meant to be wholly free of poetry?

A
dissent last month by a justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court, in seven quatrains and one footnote, drew a sharp
response from two colleagues.

Chief Justice Stephen A. Zappala wrote that "an opinion
that expresses itself in rhyme reflects poorly on the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania."

Justice Ralph J. Cappy said "every jurist has the right to
express him or herself in a manner the jurist deems
appropriate," but expressed concern about "the perception
that litigants and the public at large might form when an
opinion of the court is reduced to rhyme."

In an interview, Justice J. Michael Eakin, who wrote the
dissent, declined to talk about last month's case. But he
was cheerful and expansive on the topic of poetic justice
generally.

"You have an obligation as a judge to be right," he said,
"but you have no obligation to be dull."

The case that gave rise to his latest poem turned on
whether a lie about an engagement ring should void a
prenuptial agreement.

Louis Porreco had told his teenage wife-to-be that the ring
was worth $21,000, about half of her net worth at the time
of the marriage. Mr. Porreco, who was 30 years older than
his fiancée, was worth about $3 million. The agreement
entitled Ms. Porreco to a lump sum settlement of $3,500 per
year if the marriage failed.

After they separated, she discovered that the stone in the
engagement ring was fake.

The majority ruled that Mr. Porreco's misstatement did not
amount to fraud because she should not have trusted her
fiancé.

Justice Eakin dissented, writing:

A groom must expect matrimonial pandemonium

When his
spouse finds he's given her cubic zirconium.

Given their history and Pygmalion relation

I find her
reliance was with justification.

Cases involving prenuptial agreements seem to bring out the
poet in Justice Eakin. In 1999, as a judge on the
Pennsylvania Superior Court, he rejected a husband's effort
to undo one.

"A deal is a deal, if fairly undertaken," he wrote, "and we
find disclosure was fair and unshaken."

He has also ruled in rhyme in cases involving animals and
car repair companies.

"I would never do it in a serious criminal case," Justice
Eakin said. "The subject of the case has to call for a
little grin here or there."

Other judges have tried their hand at precedential rhyme,
not always with happy consequences. In 1975, the Kansas
Supreme Court censured a judge who sentenced a prostitute
to probation in verse.

"On January 30th, 1974," he had written, "this lass agreed
to work as a whore."

The supreme court objected, it said, not to the poetry but
to its content, which had ridiculed the defendant. "Judges
ought to be more learned than witty," the justices wrote.

Other judges have escaped judicial sanction but may be glad
there is no appeal to panels of literary critics.

A court of appeals in Michigan, in a case about an
encounter between a car and an oak tree:

We thought that we would never see

A suit to compensate a
tree.

A bankruptcy judge in Florida:

Upon consideration of Section 707(b), loud I cried

The
court's sua sponte motion to dismiss under Section 707(b)
is denied.

Stephen Gillers, who teaches legal ethics and law and
literature at New York University, said there is a place
for judicial verse.

"A couplet here or there is fine, and judges should strive
to use poetic devices in opinions to make them memorable
and readable," Professor Gillers said. "But a judge's
opinions often cause pain. Rhyming diminishes the solemnity
of the event and its seriousness to the litigants."

Justice Eakin said the people affected by his decisions
were generally amused rather than insulted. He recalled the
response of one lawyer on the losing end of a rhymed
decision.

"He filed a motion for rehearing in seven limericks," the
judge said. "He told me it was easy to rhyme `Eakin' and
`mistaken.' "

I seemed to have missed the original joke, but not all the comments
on it. Can someone e-mail it to me please?

I wrote a book about my own involuntary incarceration in a "mental
hospital" called _Insanity Factory_. It's available on Amazon.com. It
also pokes fun at higher education. There's also an e-book version
available from me. For more info see

There is still a Librarian of Congress -- The poetry title used to be Poetry
Consultant to the Library of Congress -- and even given my misgivings about
"consultantship," I have to say I liked that better (though the appointments
were no better on average then than now -- In fact, several of the first
Laureates were just previous Consultants recycled) --

Thanks for the correction. My point about the difference between a grant
and a job still stands.

Maria--

Thanks for your thoughtful comments. It was I who raised the issue about the
term "anti-Semitic", and you are right, I certainly did not intend to imply
that anti-Semitism, in its commonly understood sense (or in any uncommonly
understood sense), is ok ever. What I did mean to imply, though, is that the
use of the term could be construed as anti-Arab because, somehow, anti-Arab
actions/speech are never considered "anti-Semitic," although Arab-speaking
people are also Semitic or, rather, their language is Semitic. Somehow, over
the years, the term has come to equate Jewish (whether English- or
Hebrew-speaking, whether Israeli or non-) with Semitic and Arab (somehow
opposite of Jewish, though a geographic origin and not a religion) with,
well, a whole host of other things, including the capacity, inded the
proclivity, to be "anti-Semitic."

Subject: Re: surrealist petition for baraka

many interesting things are being said on this list on this subject.
in re this post, i agree w/ that the characterization of the ADL is
ahistorical.  I'm no fan of the ADL but they are a watchdog
organization for anti-Semitism, and that should be kept in mind.
on the other hand, i do not agree that a poem should have to be
"good" --determined by whom, by the way?  even this group of experts
evinces a wide range of opinions on the matter --in order to merit
protection and defense.  Though your explanation of your position is
thoughtful and persuasive, in general i see meritocracy as a big
problem in the poetry world.
In re someone's earlier post about the word "Semitic," I agree that
the word has come to mean something very specific --i.e. Jewish
--when the it has a broader meaning.  However, while i don't believe
this is what the poster (can't remember whom) intended, one could
construe her intervention as meaning that if the word "anti-Semitic"
*only* applied to Jews, anti-Semitism would be okay.  This is, of
course, anti-Jewish, if not "anti-Semitic."

Subject:      "good"/"bad" poetry
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Although I used to vehemently reject simplistic
"good"/"bad" poetry distinctions and interrupt
conversation if they were used, I've somewhat
mellowed, and I find situations in which the terms
make sense, ---especially since, no matter how
thoroughly one seems to have hygenicized one's
thinking, the occasion sure enough always arises where
one slips into those all-too-basic terms.

I think they're validly operative (1) where they're
spoken on an assumption of a shared understanding, so
that the terms serve as a form of short-hand for
something that both parties have a common basis for or
where further elaboration was undertaken in nearby
texts that can be taken for granted as "Recommended
Reading", where "good"/"bad" are simultaneously
translated back into more extended ideas, (2) where
they're used for reasons of verbal efficiency, and a
more accurate and detailed explanation would prove too
lengthy or unwieldly, or a "good"/"bad" question is
not the central point under consideration, so that
casualness of word-choice can be disregarded as
peripherally trivial, or (3), their most frequent use,
where you're lacking the critical apparatus to make
more nuanced distinctions.

There are, to follow Nick's metaphor, in fact numerous
circumstances where standards about "good"/"bad"
meditation, free association and prayer prevail.  ---
Some Orthodox Jews, for instance, hold that any form
of prayer that does not exclusively praise G-d but
that ~asks for something,~ a petition, is bad prayer
or not prayer at all, that it is a form of ~magic~ in
its attempt to influence or compel the deity.
Similarly, the same and related prayer-communities
reject ~idolatrous~ prayer as bad.  Prayer that is
performed as a ceremonious, rote recitation without
affective involvement is rejected as "bad" in many
denominations.  Or prayer that's done out of
superstition.  Etc.  ---  Meditation: Korean Zen talks
about "chich" (a word meaning the sound of crickets),
the chatter of the mind that meditation aims to quiet;
so that if meditation remained completely an ongoing
opportunity for the meditators to, in fact, be making
grocery lists in their heads or planning the weekend,
their meditation would be regarded as "bad." Or
meditation, say, with the ulterior motive of gaining
prestigious social standing as a result of
Enlightenment, rather than ending suffering by it.
Otherwise there would be no ~schools~ of meditation
with teacher and disciple.  The teacher is there to
help the disciple move away from directionless,
wasteful, "bad" meditation. --- And, along with free
association, psychoanalysis brings the concept of
"resistance," the analysand's persistent attempts to
refuse, hide, circumvent and avoid the repressed
material that would be a liberatory discovery whose
truth would alleviate symptoms.  If an analysand's
version of free association stayed perpetually in a
state of resistance, the analyst might eventually be
forced to terminate therapy since it wasn't "getting
anywhere" (= "bad").

(Each of these "good"/"bad" distinctions largely
operate out of their own local cultural
communities,--- which is where the notorious
~relativity~ of such criteria enters in.)


"Good"/"bad" poetry isn't necessarily ~intrinsically~
good/bad; but there is a constant assumption about
~relative~ good/bad that underlies poetry's
institutions, even where "bad" would only be the least
superlative in a string of "good," "not as good,"
"very good," etc.  The fact that magazines ~reject~
some submissions comes out of a tacit agreement about
"good"/"bad".  And book contests and awards are judged
with implicit standards of "good"/"bad" (~The *Best*
American Poetry~).

The "good"/"bad" issue is somewhat deflected by poetry
communities' clannish tendency to see "bad" poetry as
principally the style of poetry being written by
opposing poetry communities.  (Judgments against "bad"
poetry tend to be global and sweeping: Ron Silliman
recently wrote, "It is not that bad poetry cannot be
written in the post-avant mode - sign on to the
Poetics List for awhile".)


I do find myself having a feeling of "bad poetry"
about certain writing that's closer to my own
sympathies, lately, though, in reading much
"post-Language Poetry" or second generation Language.
It feels like: my impatience, an unwillingness to read
the poetry from beginning to end, a feeling of
~deja-vu,~ "been there/done that"...  My reaction is
probably a case of (3), above, a failure of my
critical preparedness: critical sensibilities that I'd
learned or developed for reading ~1980s~ Language
Poetry are somehow not able to re-articulate what's
happening when confronted by a ~simulacrum~ of 1980s
Language Poetry; what applies in one case somehow does
not carry over to a near look-alike that shares much
the same features, ...although I can't yet say how I
know it's Memorex.  In another area of fashion, its
attempt at charm would be called "retro".

I suspect that this sense of "bad" ---using Language
Poetry's own aesthetics (of a poetry weighted toward
the reader as the ultimate arbiter of meaning whose
~active~ involvement must complete the business of
meaning)--- comes out of the impression that the
investment or meaning-making that I would have to rise
to the occasion to make would be ~greater~ (more time-
and energy-consuming) than the compositional
investment that the writer is displaying.  (There's a
problem with poetry-as-materiality-of-the-medium, too,
where the imminence of the materiality conceals or
leaves out of the picture the process that lead up to
it, so that it becomes more difficult to tell the
difference between accidental and planned.)  There can
be signals in the poetry that strike me as evidence of
the hasty, the underdeveloped, not thought through...
so that it becomes completely disproportionate and
kind of absurd for a reader to go sweating out on a
limb over something that includes insufficient cues as
to its own intra-relatedness.  I think of this as
poetry that's "refusing to meet me half-way".  It's
up-ended the desired ~active~ awareness of the reader
by turning the text into an overly ~passive~ magma.

Less generally, I also react negatively ("bad") to the
trend's frequent, gratuitous use of abstract
vocabulary (literally abstract, such as "irresistible
force", "restoration", "Statement and persuasion / An
analysis of the physical aspects", or "actual
improvement",--- taken for convenience's sake from a
book recently mentioned on the List, Laura Moriarty's
~Symmetry~, a book with other strengths and appeal
which ---please don't pounce!--- I am otherwise not
condemning or dismissing wholesale) that I find
doesn't alert me it's aware of its own abstraction.
Perhaps it moves from an under-examined surface to
depth too capriciously.  Foreground/background and
field-&-ground become too blurred or dizzying.
Although it may still be achieving the "Language
Poetry effect" of jolting me into self-consciousness
about my own participation, the work itself doesn't
seem to be demonstrating any conscious grasp of the
differences among jargons and dialects that it's
employing.

Etc.

I think I may have said about Daniel Davidson
something like, "If it ~is~ political poetry, then
maybe he was just ~bad~ at it."  This "This is ~bad~"
reaction may happen once intuition becomes faster than
analysis.  After having worked through many, many
prior cases, reaction time speeds up and it takes less
("can tell in the first few lines") to jump to a
practiced conclusion that doesn't merit further
apologetics.

Hello!

a weltanschauung.  giving.  to give.  when something is "a given".  it is
the season, Winter, and to celebrate our ability to give to one another and
to receive from one another, there will be no featured readers at this
month's YARD.  there will be no featured readers because I would like you
all to come up with gifts of a literary sort that we can share with one
another on Saturday.

some examples of literary gifts:

--a cover of your favourite poem or story
--a response to or engagment with another piece of text
--a collaboration
--a large vocabulary

it is so cold outside.  and we'll soon have snow here (I hope!), so let's
warm things up a bit with mirth and good cheer. consider it a party of
sorts, a holiday party even.  after the 22nd the days start to have more
sunlight again.  what more reason do we need?

this month's reading is already a special event because filling station (the
most amazing calgary literary zine which is not connected to the English
Department at the University of Calgary) will be having a free prize draw!

issue 25 of FS is incredible, printed dos a dos with each side designed by a
different designer and both equally powerful, featuring a review of Louis
Cabri's _The Mood Embosser_(Coach house) by yours truly, writing by Salma
Hussein, Susan Holbrook, Rajinderpal S. Pal, and Ron Silliman as well
Lawrence Upton, and Bill Stenson.  acton packed with goodness!

you can pick one up at the Auburn on Saturday, at your favourite book store,
or by emailing editor@fillingstation.ca.

the important part:

Auburn Saloon
712 1st ST, SE
Saturday, December 21st

Hope to see you on Saturday and happy holidays,

Thanks for bringing this one, "The Liar", back up. I think it's interesting
- talking off the top of my head here - to compare the former "Roi" and the
later "Baraka." The former, a romantic & supple voice (read simultaneously
"tenacious" and 'vulnerable') as say, Eric Dolphy's work(sound, pacing,
weaving here then there) carries something similar. And the latter, a public
voice, where the open vulnerability gets supplanted by rhetorics of the
politas - his public voice waging a righteous war upon the others. (New
Jersey was right in choosing a laureate with a public calling as his history
- maybe they persuaded themselves that he was ("finally!") over the hill
and, in at an age of acceptance and wisdom would make a happy farewell
singing the graces of the State! Obviously, to the contrary.))
And yet wasn't it the earlier language, the one in "Liar" that produced
Jones/Baraka's most significant writing? In my life, it certainly stuck a
knife into the jugular of this country's inter-racial life. Particularly the
plays, "The Toilet" and "The Dutchman." The language - the level of combat -
in those works is definitely lasting and emerges out of a deep sense of
personal struggle with the different protagonists. The consequence of the
work -like Baldwin's best writing - was to take the reader into the space in
a way that: (1) did not allow any easy escape and (2) compelled a kind of
visceral contact with the deepest racial taboos in this culture.  No, it
didn't make anybody happy or resolved then either!
Most anytime in this culture that somebody goes down that cross-cultural
and/or racial shaft - including the artist - the way out of the madness is
often to back off and take the high ground of theoretical or rhetorical
speech. Which is not to say these positionings are wrong, but I am not sure
they lead to a langauge that survives its public occasion. Isn't it true
that you know now pretty much what you are going to get with a Baraka poem.
(Which could also be said of much of Ginsberg after about 1960)
Part of the real poetry(!)here is in the anti-poetry of the public response
to Baraka's - which in the media seems to be one verbal shameless version or
another of "lynch the poet." That's pretty scary stuff to witness and give
account - but that seems to be very much where we are.

                         that stretches from one horizon to the next

  displaced  to the ocean's depths in chains

  stilled in the wind chill

  ice at 32 degrees
                 zero centigrade

"Entering the country that is
Impenetrably ours."
   --George Oppen

I was listening to NPR commentators discuss Clarence Thomas in conjunction
with the recent ruling on cross burning.  They stammered their way through
half of a polite paragraph PRAISING the ruling and stopped!  No real
dialogue, no criticism.  How do you feel about this poets?

I feel very strongly that this ruling is the sinister GENIUS of a fascist
government.  How perfect is it to BEGIN restricting the actions and language
of a people by choosing something NO ONE will DARE speak out against?

The level of discomfort with the subject in these two NPR commentators was
evident.  They even made a point of mentioning HOW LONG AGO the Anita Hill
incident was, as if to say everything's OKAY NOW because Clarence has managed
to get a grip on his fly.  (has anyone else noticed how casual misogyny has
become in our post-feminist era?  OOPS!  I used the F word!)

Look, I'm NOT happy about having to defend cross burning, but I feel this
giant eraser is DELIBERATELY starting in a blind spot, and will be coming up
your street, and mine, one day, very soon.

I think the question of good and bad needs to be dealt with concretely, i.e. in relation to particular works, as Jeffrey does with _Culture_.  By contrast, most reviews sound as if their authors were trying to supply jacket blurbs.  And most blurbs say nothing about the particular achievements of their books.

But, insofar as one can draw general conclusions, I think that the most important fact about bad poetry is that it is unwitting.  Badness cannot be helped any more than goodness can be taken credit for.  I'm not talking about automatism or inspiration, but it does seem that, in this sense, writing really is like dreaming.

Here's what I have observed: Even gifted poets usually don't know what they're doing when they write, or whether the results are good.  They aren't totally ignorant, of course, but fundamentally they're in the dark.  That's why some (or many) are reluctant to speak about "poetics": they know that their writing is not really governed by conscious principles.  Or, if they do have principles, they know that these are so general that they explain virtually nothing about what makes an individual poem good.  Such poets understand, in other words, the importance of luck and intuition.

Yet it does seem that artistic principles really do matter, especially when, as I think Jeffrey is carefully implying, they lead to writing whose badness is egregious and therefore _could_ apparently have been avoided.  When a given poetics dominates a scene, writing becomes, as Jeffrey says, "hasty, underdeveloped, not thought through."  For my part, I think the poetics of the incomplete sentence, the non-sequitur, the stray quotation -- in short, the "experimental" style in its present incarnation -- generates (and excuses) a huge amount of bad writing (along with the occasional excellence).  This badness is slightly infuriating to some of us because it also appeals so clearly to academic notions of value and sophistication.  But, that said, I think poets are finally above or beyond blame, because they are -- at their best -- driven by urges and ambitions which make it almost impossible for them to read disinterestedly their own work.  The job of saying what is good and bad
  thus falls to other minds.

Uh, that was just oral arguments, a hearing, before the Supreme
Court, not a ruling. The Court won't issue a decision on this issue
until sometime in the spring.

I rather liked this!

Don't know if it's "good"  Don't know if that matters...  I don't like
sports myself, but I remmeber how that baseball game erased the death of
wellstone in the news and the public eye and no one has said why the plane
crashed.  Wellstone was one of my personal heroes; I had heard him speak
(boringly like a senator, but intensely and fervently in favor of my cause,
and he came to local events not just national ones, including in the
notheast despite being from MN.  He really appeared to believe in the right
things personally, not as a way to get elected (in fat he might not have
gotten reelected).  He was the only  senator against the first Gulf War in
the vote on that in the Senate, and he was one of the few fervently against
this war.  And he was fighting MS and never told anyone or exploited it,
unike the rightwingers with their long-healed war wounds who aren't going to
die of them.  I guess given that, he was spared a rather awful end, but he
had a long time left.  It seems almost disrespectful to his memory to be
upset that his death gave us a Republican and maybe was the final straw in
them taking the senate, but certainly that is very upsetting.  Now there
will be nothing to stop the president from carpet bombing the world.

On another note, I heard on the radio about an anthology about "being an
american" produced by the US Information Service which will be used as
foreign propaganda to tell the world what America is like.  It will not be
available in the US --- in fact it is ILLEGAL to sell works designated as
"for foreigners" in the US.  They intervuiewed an Arab American writer who
contrbuted, and she apparently wrote about life in an american school and
being made fun of and teased, and the "magic door" between her house and the
other kids houses, which she would become aware of when they talked of
Barbies and birthday parties -- in her house it was the veil and women
separate and so forth (so I gathered, this point wasn't made explicit).
They are delibetely including work like that to make the anthology realistic
and also because it shows how she overcame it and became a writer and radio
producer.  She was asked if she felt that contributing to such an anthology
was betraying her culture and she said she's thought about it and that if
she didn't do it somebody else would, perhaps less honestly...

Several people of note contributed to this propaganda rag including
(naturally) Billy Collins.  I have not read a word of his and have felt I
could not take part in bashing him therefore except  that I have looked at
his books in the store and found the little I saw to be quite commonplace.
Also, when I look in the C's I am looking for Clark Coolidge, Brenda
Coultas, Nicholas Christoper, possibly even Tom Clark -- all of whom will be
absent but there will be a big pile of Billy books.  I feel ok being nasty
since he contributed to the propaganda rag.

The US governemnet hopes it will be taught as a literature textbook in
colleges and schools.  It will be made available at very advantageous terms,
especially in key countries...

This is, um, not *just* about baseball . . . apologies for the length . . .
would appreciate any comment.

GAME SIX
                We should all move to Canada and say what we think of the
current situation, because
                obviously it can't be done here. If a poet could speak, we
wouldn't understand him/her--due
                to the way the reception has been constructed.

                               ---Alan Sondheim

This is the apotheosis now
where love conquers all
but she wasn't talking about
the Giants on the brink

of winning the Series, but
Swan Lake, a Bolshoi performance
we'll see on Halloween,
all thoughts of baseball

having faded in the splendor
of the pagan New Year . . .
poetry as chronicle has to
also chart what's timeless,

like marriage, not just
a moment's attraction, but why
walk Bonds in the first inning?
Russ Ortiz, California Native,

family and friends in the stands,
the north-south rivalry
that once seemed so important
when I was living in California

becomes mere rhetoric . . .
Wellstone's death already forgotten
in the political equation,
anti-war rallies not covered

by major media like Fox
where the occasional jerkiness
of this telecast reminds us
how artificial and mediated

the "coverage" really is --
unlike Homer's poetry for example
which tried so mightily
to preserve the fragility,

the attention to the moment,
and was blown away
by Plato's abstraction . . . "lovers,
or poets, who might prefer

the concrete world have
little chance of survival
in this New Republic"
Who? sabotaged Wellstone's plane

sorry, Amiri -- the extremities
of the moment do force
paranoid speculation, even in
the midst of our grief

how odd to hear the words
"the Giants, if they win
one more, will be World
Champions" no score bottom

of the third -- Ortiz the Gemini
looking strong, and at
6:00 PM Bonds walks --
like Achilles -- the angels

fleeing in terror (Appier
needs a Viagra commercial)
marriage means not having any-
more to worry about in that

regard, and Havelock reassures us
"such is the art of
the encyclopedic minstrel
who as he reports also

maintains the social and moral
apparatus of an oral culture"
like marriage -- Achilles outraged
that his mistress was usurped

by Agamemnon, the power
of the State -- CBS covers
the October 12 Demonstrations
but only by comparing them,

unfavorably, to those of
the sixties, ball one
and strike one to Sanders,
baseball possibly only

a few hours to live,
like an affair when seen
through the lens of marriage
"today's students are more concerned

about their resumes -- they want
to get a job"   Shawann!!!
6:22 El Tiempo Pacifico
how about that DH rule?

monkeys and ape (eeyers) to
angels, but they skipped humans!
Nothing brings back Wellstone,
but I'm happy for Shawann,

his son sitting happily on his lap
"an encyclopedic vision with which
goes a total acceptance
of the mores of society, and

an affection for its thought-forms"
it is how I think Homer must have worked
Ortiz the Gemini looking strong
28 years old Saturn in early Cancer

like the moon tonight
and BONDS! obligatory kiss
to the son "He profoundly
accepts this society, not

by personal choice but because
of his fundamental role
as recorder and preserver" . . .
"The furniture in the house

may undergo some rearrangement
but there cannot be a manufacture
of new furniture. If we ask:
Why then is he not dull?

we should reply perhaps
that he would be dull
if he performed those functions
as would a literate poet

composing for readers. But he
is an oral poet composing
according to psychological laws
which were unique, which

have literally ceased to exist
at least in Europe and the West."
Mrs. Autry waves the monkey
touched by an angel

"a piece of reporting
becomes a dramatic device"
the rats -- distant cousins
to Mickey Mouse -- rattle

in the drop ceiling above us
two balls two strikes to Salmon
7:11 PM and Ortiz
strikes him out looking!

Fox keeps showing promos
for "24," but, you know,
those hours have already
been filmed (unlike this report)

"artistic creation as we
understand the term is
a much simpler thing
than the epic performance

and it is one which implies
the separation of the artist
from political and social action"
I didn't go to the demonstration

watched the World Series instead
"he waited 39 years
for the biggest hit of his life"
Dunston born in the early sixties

when the movement was pure
LOFTON! another home run
the Giants now appear
to have won the World Series

this is the apotheosis now
when love conquers all
the angels revealing themselves
as mere monkeys, Darwin was

right after all, this is,
let's not forget, Orange County,
birthplace of Richard Nixon
and the most rabid Republicans

known to man, the kind
that would sabotage Wellstone's plane
Michael Eisner looking on
as Spezio hits it out

is it a Disney finish after all?
my fucking god are they
going to blow this again?
it may seem strange to say

but a poetics of the moment
depends on the moment
and demands astrology
but Salmon singles before

I can look up his chart
Jesus! 5-4 Nen in
why can't this team win?
the pitching change allows me

to check the ephemeris
Nen born under Sagittarius
like the Ape Eyer but GLAUS!
this is an embarrassing collapse

you can't lose a five nothing lead
in the seventh! Shit!
I didn't see this coming
unlike the encyclopedic minstrel

but could I handle
the Giants winning am I
ready for that apotheosis?
obviously not I can't decide

between my wife and my lover
in the city of the angels
Orpheus bringing on Christianity
teaching Plato all he knew

after the forms could Jesus
be far behind? the spin

I didnt see it obviously being about 20,000 miles away; but its doesnt sound
good. They pick on something quite obvious: earlier they banned some funny
adverts with Bush in them: thy have the Homeland Security; in NZ and
Australia the same very draconian anti-terrorist laws apply: people can be
held without trial or even without a lawyer; I can see that the facade of
democracy will collapse; we need Barakas and others like the Berrigans;
despite what Harry Nudel says ( I am affable with Harry back chennel but we
disagreee); things are not good...Patrick Herron can tell you...he was
warning me before S11.

I foresee a super fascist state geared to the benefit of the very rich: it
will be more subtle than Hitler's attempt, but it will work, it will be
possibly world wide ...democracy ...weak as it already is...will phased out
in favour of the  TELEVSION AND COMPUTER GENERATED ILLUSION of democracy.
The US will ahmmer who theyb want. The working people of the world will
suffer more. There will be more wars unless people get organised and unified
against the Bush and teh Republicans and Blair and Israel (the present
regime there) and Russia.

Journalists if they arent payed of will be threatened and cowed: ,amy will
stay silent "trustingrto Congree" and d"due prosess as others are led away
into jails. No trials.  You now have Georgian Stalinism: watch it grow!!

Unles there are mass protests and counterattacks by the people.

I think I was with you much of the way on this, Andrew; and then, having
said we need to be concrete by referring to particulars (particular works,
you said), you became general with _the incomplete sentence, the
non-sequitur, the stray quotation -- in short, the "experimental" style_

I am unclear what the "present incarnation" is in connection with
incomplete sentences. I was reading some Lee Harwood recently, and I dont
think that's what you mean, but he's still writing. Incomplete sentences
have been around a long time and often they are no more incomplete than
sentences in the spoken language

The non-sequitur? Disjunction, you mean? No? Anyway,old as the built-on
hills Like the previous, these are the mechanics rather than the style
itself.

Stray quotation? Would  that be a quotation the relevance of which you do
not understand? Otherwise, who decides it is stray?

Concrete references would have helped  comprehension, as you indicate.

"Experimental" is a useless term, meaningless; and putting it in quotes
won't help that. Or whom are you quoting?

A style which does not experiment is likely to be a dead style though it may
be a fertile basis for someone who wishes to say "This is good... this
isn't" (excluding the rather careful Jeffrey made)

All styles, all approaches, lead to bad writing. Look at  what was written
at the time at any time and the bulk of it is shit; and some of it is good,
but most of that is missed at the time by the arbiters of good and bad often
*because they use absolute terms arrived at by undisclosed judgements

I think there're enough other attacks on the 1st amendment in various
legislative acts and executive actions that are already actively
going right now, that it's hard for me to get too worked up about a
possible judicial decision several months ahead of time.

"most of that is missed at the time by the arbiters of

"

This is quite true..."good"/"bad" proclamations always
depend on a community of users, and these communities
routinely proclaim their own members practioners of
the "good"---I tend to resist this sort of thing, this
parsing in dualities, because it too often is linked
to group thought: instead, I try to define what I like
about a particular work, and what I dislike about a
particular work--which does not lead to any useful
poetics, of course, but does make an attempt to widen
criteria beyond those acceptable to a certain group of
people...I've seen a lot of what I would consider bad
poetry produced by those with great reputations--these
works would be declared good by those in certain
communities because it's been agreed upon by the
community that they like this author's work--(this is
painfully evident in hypermedia)...so, really, nine
times out of ten, I suspect that these communities
don't even need to read or examine work they consider
good---it comes about solely via cult of personality--
---as for Mr. Silliman's remarks that "bad poetry is
possible in the post-avant mode--just sign onto the
poetics list for a while"--well, you can't please
everyone--I for one work only on pleasing myself,
which is hard enough--
as for there Mr. Rathman's remarks: I would agree, to
a point==I've always wanted to see more synthesis in
contemporary poetry, rather than more
disjunction--I've always wanted a smoother
disjunction--of course, my own work is heardly
"experimental" (& i agree with lawrence that this is a
useless term, fit only for those who wish to dismiss a
poetry because of it's resistence to closure, which is
often distasteful to mono-logical palettes (heh
heh)...)===but my tastes change day by day, & i strive
to write that way...
bliss

Hi Caoimhin,

I've hear Paul D. in action a few times, a wonderful reader.

His selected _A Snail In My Prime_, Harvill 1993,  Glasgow, ISBN
0-000271323-3, gives a substantial gathering of work.

best

Referring to James, I think, "to be kind" thrice,
reinforces, resurfaces, shall we say, a value that I
think so very useful, in addition to its more glowing
properties. Thinking aloud here, I used to say how
much I resented the loss of any time and energy I felt
I needed to devote to defense or bully-thwarting. I
still feel this way. Despite a firm commitment to
placing attention on the more luxurious aspects of
living and perceiving, there have been and will
continue to be times when immersion in refined
thought/feeling is sacrificed to struggles in the mud.
One strategy is to invest in the possibility of being
able to "afford" long spaces away from the grit and
grime involved in fending off predators.

All this moves on into and through the "good and bad"
poetry issue. A lot of time is likely wasted on
campaigning in favor of something that ought to
persuade various ones by the nature of itself. I'm far
less interested in making proclamations of "no value"
than I am in celebrating what works, in whatever way
that word might mean.

It has also occurred to me that it generally takes far
more perspicacity to discern what is "right" about a
thing than what is "wrong."

This might be a "bad" poem -- like Andrew said earlier today, I can't quite
tell. It's certainly longish, for which I apologize, as well as "political"
-- I think -- so it's a first response to Gary and Jeffrey's comments (and
Ryan Whyte before them) for a post of mine some weeks ago. And it's not just
about baseball. And happy holidays . . .

GAME SIX

we can't write after the fact - only during it -
---Alan Sondheim

This is the apotheosis now
where love conquers all
but she wasn't talking about
the Giants on the brink

of winning the Series, but
Swan Lake, a Bolshoi performance
we'll see on Halloween,
all thoughts of baseball

having faded in the splendor
of the pagan New Year . . .
poetry as chronicle has to
also chart what's timeless,

like marriage, not just
a moment's attraction, but why
walk Bonds in the first inning?
Russ Ortiz, California Native,

family and friends in the stands,
the north-south rivalry
that once seemed so important
when I was living in California

becomes mere rhetoric . . .
Wellstone's death already forgotten
in the political equation,
anti-war rallies not covered

by major media like Fox
where the occasional jerkiness
of this telecast reminds us
how artificial and mediated

the "coverage" really is --
unlike Homer's poetry for example
which tried so mightily
to preserve the fragility,

the attention to the moment,
and was blown away
by Plato's abstraction . . . "lovers,
or poets, who might prefer

the concrete world have
little chance of survival
in this New Republic"
Who? sabotaged Wellstone's plane

sorry, Amiri -- the extremities
of the moment do force
paranoid speculation, even in
the midst of our grief

how odd to hear the words
"the Giants, if they win
one more, will be World
Champions" no score bottom

of the third -- Ortiz the Gemini
looking strong, and at
6:00 PM Bonds walks --
like Achilles -- the angels

fleeing in terror (Appier
needs a Viagra commercial)
marriage means not having any-
more to worry about in that

regard, and Havelock reassures us
"such is the art of
the encyclopedic minstrel
who as he reports also

maintains the social and moral
apparatus of an oral culture"
like marriage -- Achilles outraged
that his mistress was usurped

by Agamemnon, the power
of the State -- CBS covers
the October 12 Demonstrations
but only by comparing them,

unfavorably, to those of
the sixties, ball one
and strike one to Sanders,
baseball possibly only

a few hours to live,
like an affair when seen
through the lens of marriage
"today's students are more concerned

about their resumes -- they want

monkeys and ape (eeyers) to

Nothing brings back Wellstone,
but I'm happy for Shawann,

his son sitting happily on his lap
"an encyclopedic vision with which
goes a total acceptance
of the mores of society, and

an affection for its thought-forms"
it is how I think Homer must have worked
Ortiz the Gemini looking strong
28 years old Saturn in early Cancer

like the moon tonight
and BONDS! obligatory kiss
to the son "He profoundly
accepts this society, not

by personal choice but because
of his fundamental role
as recorder and preserver" . . .
"The furniture in the house

may undergo some rearrangement
but there cannot be a manufacture
of new furniture. If we ask:
Why then is he not dull?


we should reply perhaps
that he would be dull
if he performed those functions
as would a literate poet

composing for readers. But he
is an oral poet composing
according to psychological laws
which were unique, which

have literally ceased to exist
at least in Europe and the West."
Mrs. Autry waves the monkey

Fox keeps showing promos
for "24," but, you know,
those hours have already
been filmed (unlike this report)

"artistic creation as we
understand the term is
a much simpler thing
than the epic performance

and it is one which implies
the separation of the artist
from political and social action"
I didn't go to the demonstration

watched the World Series instead
"he waited 39 years
for the biggest hit of his life"
Dunston born in the early sixties


when the movement was pure
LOFTON! another home run
the Giants now appear

this is the apotheosis now
when love conquers all
the angels revealing themselves
as mere monkeys, Darwin was

let's not forget, Orange County,
birthplace of Richard Nixon
and the most rabid Republicans

that would sabotage Wellstone's plane

you can't lose a five nothing lead

IDENTITY / GENDER / QUEER THEORY
kari edwards


         I hold the unique position of a gender voyeur, disidentifying =
with=20
the system, but still very much a part of the system which gives me a=20
unique vision of the world inaccessible to insiders.

        as a writer I attempt to disidentifying from the "narrative" and =
use=20
it at the same time to test the limits of its intelligibly, truth, and=20=

reality of societal taboos. I write from the fringes of what is seen as=20=

recognizable, not where gender and sexuality are defined in a neat=20
bipolar package.

        language has become a mac-speak, simple classifications for=20
everything, you=92re a number two with a side order of fries. these=20
classifications (never names . . . [but] one classes someone else) are=20=

bound up with force and violence, placing one in set of relationship[s]=20=

structured through sanctions and taboos ever present in a gendercentric=20=

society, especially when the difference between "women" and "men".
        we continue to believe in the myth that "men" and "women" have =
always=20
existed and will always exist, and that the categories of male and=20
female are based on anatomical criteria - which are neither universal=20
nor valid concepts.
        are you then amazed that the history books have excluded or =
=93newly=94=20
discovered as parenthetical's to human development; the hijras of india=20=

who have existed outside the gender binary for a thousand years, the=20
first nation=92s two spirit people, the castrated gallaes (who date back=20=

to the stone age),  the gender transformations in ovid=92s =
metamorphosis,=20
pope joan,  the sapphist and molly=92s who were considered a third and=20=

fourth gender, and or the drag queens at stone wall.
        Whenever there are two [genders], a third cannot be far behind, =
and=20
where there is a third, there can be a forth and a fifth and so on. we=20=

want to think gender is solid, and that there is an absolute=20
segregation between genders, but then that would deny the existence of=20=

those who are intersexed, and the numerous types of chromosome=20
configurations. if we continue to insist on this segregation by=20
personal pronouns, we will continue to perpetrate a reliance on the=20
slave master relationship.
        we might say, one is not born a woman [or man, but] becomes one =
. .=20
. [one then could say,] if one chooses, [one could choose to] become=20
neither female or male, woman or man. If human beings have constructed=20=

and used gender - human beings can deconstruct and stop using gender.=20
the most obvious way would be to deliberately  and self consciously not=20=

use gender.
        what I am suggesting here, is that we call into question the =
structure=20
. . . [in] which we recognize each other as human[s].
        We are living in an historical discursive moment in which our=20
language has run out, maybe its so beyond our words that we don't know=20=

how to talk about it.  we need to recognize that there is no longer a=20
stable binary, when men have vaginas and women have penises. when we=20
can surgically alter and or strap on theme and variation genitalia=20
beyond most peoples imagination and where sexual encounters are no=20
longer held tightly in categories of gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual,=20=

transgender, but multi-locations of desire.
        gender then can become an action that requires a new vocabulary.
        If each person has their own individual perception to time and =
space
which is based on relationships to the objects, then could this not=20
also so be said of a person relationship to gender, sexuality or even=20
language?
        If [we] continue to speak of ourselves and conceive of ourselves =
as=20
women and men, we deny each and every person their individual=20
relationship to (language), space, time and gender.
        We need to imagine another body, capable of living beyond the=20
incompleteness of what we designate as real . . . alive in its own=20
name, in its own words, where everyone exists as an individual, as well=20=

as a member of a community. it is time to take the next radical step in=20=

dismantling a history of segregation by insisting that there is such a=20=

thing as a proper language, proper gender and proper sexuality.

FRESCOES

(left to right)


I

Flowers through a chain-link fence
Are monkeys shaking hands from a cage.

A Panamanian with tartar skin
And wrinkles of fresh cut wood
Points to an altar un-altered by bombs,
His open smile is a rocking boat.

The gringo with a Lonely Planet asks
“Why don’t you hate us?”

Dandelion puffs float in flocks of wishes.

II

A cardinal wiggles through the wind
Like a goldfish dipping in a bowl.

Schools of dry leaves paper airplane.

Geese hover, black origami,
Then drop like arrows for a rain.

Behind the shades, Father Meenan whispers
To the high school girl that she can be
A Bride of Christ if she closes her eyes
And feels the physical nature of the Lord.

Stars in the sky, the snipped tips
Of the marionette strings.


III.

A bald punk rocker screams at the eclipse:

“You burning bastard!  It’s about time your
white brother came and blackened your eye!”

His head, a light bulb mooning a crude oil night.

IV.

A shovel bells bedrock but houses grow
And fashions get painted over again.

Melees of Spanish, Italian, English and pig
Latin tightrope clotheslines
And lace triple-deckers.

Chilis instead of tomato,
Pesto instead of guacamole?

American instead of chop-suey.

V.

The sails of distant ships are shark fins.
The waves, tame infantry in green,
March to shore to land on their knees.

Max stands in the middle screaming
Form is only an extension of content.

From the right waves gallop with white manes,
Trampling the lobster knight.
Twin lighthouses painted as candles flicker overhead.

VI.

Graffiti in red on a wall:

DEATH IS SO FAR AWAY FROM ME

IF I GOT THERE I’D BE LOST.



VII.

Legions of children in soccer uniforms
Are linked like paper cut-out kids
And wait in line for
“The Art of Pele the King.”

(They made balls from socks
And practiced penalty kicks)

A goalie stands in front of the goal
Like a gun on a tank.

Pele scores in black and white
And dots their eyes.

And why do they hate us?



VIII.

A kitchen window is wide open.

The newspaper, a taught
Sail in your hands.

The eggs on the frying pan
Are fresh daisies

Floating in a black pool.



IX.

Windows flash and flicker blue
From television sets casting silhouettes
Of our heads.

Billy Bulger won’t help them find
What they are looking for.

What a whitey.

Oh well.

The clouds as tops of ice-cream cones.


X.

Scratching a head on a pedestal
Like a crystal ball,

A woman seems to be thinking

If we knew what you were thinking
You would be easy to know.

A big Buick glides under a small sun.

A Playboy calendar at the shop
Flips as quick as a cartoon book
                                     through time.

Why can't you put tree-limbs on the tree-branch house?
Because it's against the law.

(The humor in this lies in the fact that the joke takes an _unexpected

Sheila, I posted this once before, four yrs ago. This from THE POLYANTHOS
of 1809, an American periodical, from a piece entitled "New Art of
Criticism" by Henry Brooke.

   "RULE I. Find fault, at first sight, with every thing that is published.
   This is the first and fundamental rule of all good criticism; and is
   itself founded upon solid reasons. For, 1st. It is ten to one but you are
   in the right; there being at least ten bad productions published every
   day, for one good one.

   2dly. Because finding fault implies a plain superiority of genius....Claim
   boldly, then, for criticism hath, in this respect, some resemblence to
   calumny;  and, indeed, it is so like it, in some hands, that none can
   adept distinguish them; and you know the rule, calumniare fortiter (in
   English criticise boldly)....
           It is a clear consequence from this rule, you should always
   censure those works most, which are thought most to excel....

   RULE III. If your own authority is not sufficient to quell
   opposition, and carry your point; why then, two or three of you join
   forces, and call yourselves the WORLD -- and the work is done....[A]
   critic is a judge; and everyone knows, the business of a judge is, not to
   draw up pleadings, but to pronounce sentence."

i think un-reconstructed marxists should look at a divide more obvious than
class in the usa.
the 9/11 event was executed by second generation muslim americans with
houses and mortgages and lawns to mow.
it may not be monetary capitalism that is in decay but cultural capitalism.
i fear bush is gearing up to protect the white anglo saxon christian
majority in his country and world-wide.

FYI...


----------

CALL FOR PAPERS:

Desire in Transition: An anthology by, for and about partners and potential
partners of trans(gender/sexual), intersex, and gender queer people

Partners and potential partners of gender queer people are extremely diverse
and rarely visible as a group. We are people of all genders (trans and
otherwise), people of all sexual identities (straight, lesbian, gay,
bisexual, pansexual, trans-sensual, s/m, vanilla, some of us still searching
for terminology and some happy without it), not to mention body sizes and
shapes, races, ethnicities, health statuses, physical abilities, economic
classes and so on.  Part of our invisibility is that there doesn't seem to
be a simple name for the one thing we have in common. "Homosexual" might
work for similarly gendered trans people in relationships, but not all of us
with differently gendered preferences are comfortable with "heterosexual,"
and "transsexual" is already taken. It's time for an anthology to begin to
illustrate who we are (in all of our diversity), the issues with which we
struggle, and what we're doing to make the world a better place.

We imagine this book as a beginning of a conversation among lovers of gender
variant folks and the varied communities to which we belong.

So,

We're looking for writing (essays, memoirs, stories, poetry, etc.) on the
following topics or others that you believe would be important for such a
book:

Coming out stories  How has your thinking about your sexual identity and
relationship changed over time?  Did a partner you were already with, come
out as trans? Or, did you find a pattern in the types of people you were
attracted to?  What have you come out as?  Have you come out more than once,
with more than one sexual identity?  How did others react when you told
them?  What were your hopes and fears in coming out?  How have they come
true or not?  Did your partner or ex come out to you?  And how did you
react?

Sex Desire, erotica, safer sex, S/M, vanilla, phone sex, public sex,
fantasies, fuck-ups, and so on?) v Relationships (Is there anything special
about trans or differently gendered relationships?  How have your views on
relationships changed with your partners and/or identities?  Changes during
transition, trans people telling their partners, non-trans partners'
transitions, how to be a political ally to your romantic partner/s,
inter-racial relationships, internet dating, monogamy and polyamory,
commitment ceremonies, state-sanctioned marriages, domestic violence?

Creating Community Where do we fit, and how have our communities responded?
How have our non-trans-identified communities adjusted or changed? Who has
come into our lives that we might not otherwise have met? What barriers have
obstructed our efforts to create community, and how have we dealt with them?
What has been fun or fabulous about your gender community?

Organizing for Social Change

What kinds of trans/partners political organizing are we doing? What tips do
we have for others? How do we work with and in existing political
organizations: queer, people of color, labor, feminist, fat liberationist
and other movements? How has being a partner of a trans person fit with
and/or changed and/or enhanced your political analysis?

Submissions should be no more than 15 pages (double spaced) or 3700 words.

I can only assume that twenty-three of them must serve
the whole damn country. Always wondered where that phrase
came from -- had never noticed the irony though.

I don't live in Virginia anymore, by the way. I live in
California, which as we all know is one big ethernet.

The problem of the sox and the hat may indeed preclude the continuation,
possible, completion, or furtherance, or initiation, intimation,
consideration, contemplation, enfilement,  and indeed any creepance toward
even a crepuscular guesturation (given that monsieur harry von nudel  has
violently suggested i swallow more pills when i suggested that he might
becoming hitlerian or at the very least "cranky" or nudelian) (with which
suggestion I partially concurred as I am not averse to the odd drop of lion
red combined with say 2000 milligrams of valium - it is very relaxing, one
must understand....oh, and some morphine of an evening......as part of me at
least loves to be morphed, as indeed in the literal sense we all are, or at
least those of us who....are...Plato....Pluto..ah...hmmm...where was I?...)
..as I say, GIVEN these issues (what issues? where was?)  I think that
mister Billly Bush and Amiri Collins should be invited to explain what isnt
(or IS as the case may or may not be) decaying in the carious teeth of the
ed dornian desert that spreads around the dying globe these all-hating days
when decent has descended to descant and crooked backs do redance the dance:
all of which leads me to feel deeply frustrate in regard to these
possibilities - and my brilliant proposal of a philosophy and an exchange by
Silly Bollins or Mabiri Araka or whoever wanders off the streets  (say some
homless guy from Manhatten or Philadelphia or Boston or even Texas or
Auckland, K Road) to discuss with us these matters I too much am explained
too much am; too much entwisted and twined: too much do I indeed too much
indeed: and hence in the event of the non appearance or other of B Von
Collinski or Baraki on our hallowed List I must desist, or despair, or just
dissolve......but to this non soluble (or soluble as the case may or ma...)
event: to this non or to this event, I ascribe as the raison: the Hat and
the Sox.

its red with if I recall blue New York on it...if you do find it I would
greatly appreciate its return as I was going to gift it to harry nudel, ron
silliman or george bowering or whoever else.....

For some reason I missed this inquiry when it first appeared -- Did anybody
answer your questions?

Moore appears on an early Muhal Richard Abrams album from Delmark that has been
reissued on CD -- sorry I don't have full info for you -- I'm in California and
my stuff is in Pennsylvania -- but I can dig things out when I go back to the
campus around 1/12 --

Moore was much anthologized in the late 60s --

BLACK SPIRITS has not been reissued,,,, was barely circulated at the time,
though it was a MOTOWN product!

There was an accomanying anthology edited by Woody King, though the book's
contents differ from the LP  (for example, the strange Baraka poem on the
recording is not in the book) --

Surrealism for Sale, Straight From the Source

December 17, 2002
By ALAN RIDING






PARIS, Dec. 16 - In photographs André Breton is rarely seen
smiling. As the founder and undisputed leader of the
Surrealist movement, he evidently took himself seriously.
Between the 1920's and 1950's he alone defined the rules of
Surrealism and tolerated no challenge to his authority. He
encouraged rebellion against prevailing artistic and social
norms, but artists and poets who fell out of his favor were
summarily expelled from the movement.

On the other hand, he must have had loads of charisma.


Over the years, in addition to the artworks he bought,
notably primitive sculptures from Oceania, hundreds of
paintings, drawings, photographs and books were given to
him by friends, followers and little-known artists seeking
his blessing. When Breton died at 70 on Sept. 28, 1966, his
small apartment at 42 Rue Fontaine in the Pigalle district
of Paris was a veritable treasure trove. He had lived there
since 1922. His heirs - his widow, Elisa, and his daughter
from an earlier relationship, Aube - decided to touch
nothing. "My stepmother lived there, and it was her family
environment," Aube Breton Elléouët, 67, explained. "For 35
years we looked for an answer to what could be done with
this collection. My father had never expressed himself on
the subject."

Now, two years after Elisa Breton's death, with the French
government unwilling to buy the collection, the largest
single record of the Surrealist movement is to be sold next
spring at the Hôtel Drouot-Richelieu, where Paris auctions
are held. One measure of the size of the sale is that the
auction house, CalmelsCohen, plans at least six catalogs to
cover the 5,300 lots. The auction, from April 1 to 18, is
expected to raise $30 million to $40 million.

Books, which account for 3,500 of the lots, include some
dedicated to Breton by Freud, Trotsky and Apollinaire as
well as art catalogs and journals. Among the 500 lots of
manuscripts are originals of some of Breton's writings as
well as records of Surrealist "games" and experiments.
Modern art is represented by 450 paintings, drawings and
sculptures and 500 lots of photographs. And there are 200
examples of popular art and 150 works of primitive art,
mainly from Oceania. (A description of the collection is
online at breton.calmelscohen.com.)

To compensate for the inevitable dispersal of the
collection, the entire contents of 42 Rue Fontaine have
been recorded digitally and will be made available through
a CD-ROM. "Everything," explains a news release by
Jean-Michel Ollé and Jean-Pierre Sakoun, who prepared the
database. "Paintings, objects, photos, manuscripts, books.
Everything from the least important to the most, the
historic and the everyday, the private and the public."

The principal item not included in the auction is what is
known as Breton's Wall, literally the cluttered wall behind
his desk that was featured in many photographs and came to
be considered a work of art - the art of collecting - in
its own right. The wall was given by Mrs. Breton Elléouët
to the National Museum of Modern Art at the Georges
Pompidou Center in lieu of death duties owed to the
government by the Breton estate.

The wall's shelves are crowded with dozens of Oceanic
sculptures as well as Inuit objects and pre-Hispanic
figures from Mexico. On the wall itself are paintings,
engravings and drawings by the likes of Francis Picabia,
Alfred Jarry, Roberto Matta, Jean Arp, Marcel Duchamp,
Picasso, Joan Miró and Wassily Kandinsky. And tucked among
them is the odd personal item, like a photograph of Elisa
Breton.

Yet the collection to be sold in the spring reveals more
about Breton's approach to art, since it includes not only
major works, but also lesser works by long forgotten
artists and even objects that Breton bought at auctions and
flea markets or simply found while out strolling.

"My father had as much passion for a piece found on the
bank of a river as for an important painting in his
collection," Mrs. Breton Elléouët said.

Still, the auction will not lack important works, notably
"Danseuse Espagnole" or "Spanish Dancer," by Miró, Matta's
"Poster for Arcane 17," Magritte's "Woman Hidden in a
Forest," an untitled work by Arshile Gorky and "Danger,
Dancer," a painting on a photograph on glass by Man Ray. It
also includes scores of less valuable works by equally
famous artists, among them Picasso, Picabia, Arp, Duchamp,
Max Ernst, Wilfredo Lam, Victor Brauner and André Masson.
More than 100 original prints by Man Ray dominate the
photography collection.

Notably absent is any work by Giorgio de Chirico, the
Italian Metaphysical painter, with whom Breton fell out.
And a postcard-size collage and gouache is the only work in
the sale by Salvador Dali, easily the most famous
Surrealist painter, who was expelled from the movement by
Breton. The auction also includes no book by the poet Louis
Aragon, another friend turned foe. The evidence is clear:
Surrealist rebels were expurgated from Breton's life.

Breton himself, while he dabbled with collages and wrote
poetry of considerable merit, was most famous simply for
being Breton. He was above all immensely curious, his early
poetry and interest in psychoanalysis serving as a
springboard for Surrealism's constant exploration of the
connections between poetry and life, chance, love and
sexuality. To describe Surrealism as a sect is to ignore
its enormous influence, but Breton himself was very much
its guru.

"I believe it is into my thought that I put all my daring,
all the strength and hope of which I am capable," he wrote
in a letter to the art collector Jacques Doucet in December
1924, shortly after publication of the Surrealist
Manifesto. "It possesses me entirely, jealously and makes a
mockery of worldly goods."

Certainly while Surrealism today is best remembered through
the works of Dali, Magritte, Miró and Ernst, visual art was
not central to Breton's vision of the movement. Yet he
undoubtedly had an eye for innovative art: it was at his
insistence that in 1924 Doucet bought one of the landmark
works of 20th-century art, Picasso's "Desmoiselles
d'Avignon," now a jewel in the collection of the Museum of
Modern Art in New York.

As an inspiration for Surrealism, though, Breton was drawn
principally to Oceanic art, which he described as "one of
the great lock-keepers of our heart." While African art was
the rage in Paris at the time, he felt it was too linked to
human rituals and animals. He preferred Oceanic art "for
its immemorial effort to express the interpenetration of
the physical and the mental, to triumph over the dualism of
perception and representation." Put more simply, he
considered it more mystical.

"Oceanic objects were Breton's companions all his life,"
said Pierre Amrouche, an expert on primitive art who is an
adviser to the Breton auction. "It was his family, a tribe
of which he was the chief. The very first object he
acquired was an Easter Island piece bought when he was 15
with money he was given for good school results." (The most
valuable Oceanic work in the auction is "Uli," a
four-foot-high wooden ancestor statue from the South
Pacific island New Ireland, with a sale price estimated at
$600,000 to $800,000.)

When Breton traveled to Mexico in 1938 to visit the exiled
Trotsky, he discovered pre-Hispanic art. And when he was
himself exiled in the United States during World War II, he
further developed his interest in American Indian and Inuit
art, which also joined his collection. From 1941 to 1945,
with Ernst, Dali, Matta and other Surrealists also in
exile, New York became the temporary capital of Surrealism,
although Breton never felt at home there: he never bothered
to learn English.

His own political views were always on the left, but he was
a true militant only of Surrealism. He joined the French
Communist Party in 1927 and, unaccustomed to taking orders,
was soon horrified by its dogmatism. He finally resigned
from the party in 1935 (this was the main cause of his rift
with Aragon, who stayed in the party), but after the war he
was a vocal critic of France's involvement in wars in
Indochina and Algeria and an outspoken foe of Stalinism.

Although Surrealism survived the war, with Breton himself
returning to Paris to preside over it, by the 1950's and
1960's it had been overtaken by new art movements. Yet when
Breton died, while Surrealist paintings hung on the walls
of museums around the world, it was at 42 Rue Fontaine that
the soul of the movement resided. Works were frequently
loaned for exhibitions, but repeated efforts by his widow
and daughter to win government backing for creation of a
Breton or a Surrealist foundation came to nothing.

After Elisa Breton's death in early 2000 and the transfer
of Breton's Wall to the Pompidou, Mrs. Breton Elléouët
decided to make an inventory of the collection. "That's
when we became involved," Laurence Calmels, a partner in
CalmelsCohen, recalled. "We arrived at 42 Rue Fontaine,
where nothing had changed except `the Wall.' Breton's desk
was as he left it, his pipe, the bag of tobacco, the books.
There were paintings on walls, but we found many covered in
dust in a mezzanine. There were cartons of documents. He
kept everything. It took three months to do the inventory."


It was only then, convinced that she had no alternative,
that Mrs. Breton Elléouët reluctantly chose to sell the
collection. "A few works have been sold to the Pompidou and
the new Primitive Arts Museum," she said. "As for the rest
of the collection, during 35 years of representations we
received not a single proposal or offer of help."

i agree...
in school i had a prof who used a "sticky-bouncy"
method to critique poems---she would describe what in
a poem stuck to her peception, and what in a poem
bounced her away...
this is in general the method i use in looking at any
work---there's "theory," of course (and when it comes
to hypermedia in particular i have some strong
beliefs, mostly fostered by long hours stooped over
programming manuals)(i have some strong beliefs as far
as theory goes for poetry too: but these are personal,
& i try not to look at any language work through such
a lens: those parameters are reserved strictly for the
formulation of my own work)...
above all, yes, be kind! kindness and encouragement
fosters great work! (and you, sheila, have encouraged
me more than anyone I know!)
bliss
l

Sheila sez:Referring to James, I think, "to be kind"
thrice,
reinforces, resurfaces, shall we say, a value that I
think so very useful, in addition to its more glowing
properties. Thinking aloud here, I used to say how
much I resented the loss of any time and energy I felt
I needed to devote to defense or bully-thwarting. I
still feel this way. Despite a firm commitment to
placing attention on the more luxurious aspects of
living and perceiving, there have been and will
continue to be times when immersion in refined
thought/feeling is sacrificed to struggles in the mud.
One strategy is to invest in the possibility of being
able to "afford" long spaces away from the grit and
grime involved in fending off predators.

All this moves on into and through the "good and bad"
poetry issue. A lot of time is likely wasted on
campaigning in favor of something that ought to
persuade various ones by the nature of itself. I'm far
less interested in making proclamations of "no value"
than I am in celebrating what works, in whatever way
that word might mean.

It has also occurred to me that it generally takes far
more perspicacity to discern what is "right" about a
thing than what is "wrong."

romantic matter



I was possessed by legs that followed me . . . in the morning they
would kick me awake. the problem, they lived under water and started to
decompose -  disconnected from the main frame.
~

I confronted evil (or the devil) and invited satan to fuck off. I mean
this is a little scary . . . telling beelzebul to get the fuck out of
my 24 foot trailer . . . its enough to make your skin crawl with gnats.
this was going to be a battle alright. I knew it was him or at least
his stand-in. at this point there were no assumption, only matter. I
told him again to leave my travel queen - but that only pissed him off.
I called a truce between the buddha and christ . . . had them hold
hands on my coffee table . . . that started to work . . . I could
finally see my kitchenette . . . then I had to pee - and all hell broke
loose.

Saturnalia Song









Ice swirls painted on the window is the sorrow song sung as Jack Frost

swoops past his blonde haired love whistling in celebration of the season



winter gathering eternity as an evergreen tree adorned

slightly off center, tarnished heirlooms glass



as nostalgia brought down from the attic, colorful garlands decorate woven
green

twigs, dried ornamented shells brought forward as a tree of life,



nestles in its branches intricate light



lights of real candles with apples, ribbons, cinnamon sticks,

and bits of magical symbols that blaze the magic in mistletoe







during their celebration of Saturnalia, Rome's Empire

was ruled by a king for the day, chosen by bean ballot

and every kind of work ceased in celebration of the season







Ice is the frozen contemplation, a moment in meditation

to remind one of the Sun's rebirth and the promise

of new beginnings and hope in the new year.



and bits that blaze forward as a tree of symbols

gathering eternity as an evergreen, adorned

Reject DC over Venezuela



December 17, 2002
Please Distribute Widely

Dear Colleagues,

A paragraph in Spanish followed by its translation into English...

"RESUELVE: Respaldar plenamente la institucionalidad democrática y
constitucional de la República Bolivariana de Venezuela, cuyo gobierno
preside Hugo Chávez Frías, y rechazar categóricamente cualquier intento de
golpe de estado o alteración del orden constitucional venezolano que afecte
gravemente el orden democrático.”

- la Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA)

“RESOLVED: To fully back the democratic and constitutional legitimacy of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, whose government is led by Hugo Chávez
Frías, and to reject, categorically, any coup attempt or alteration of
constitutional order that seriously affects democratic rule.”

- the Organization of American States (OAS)


12:21 p.m. ET, December 17, 2002:

One hour and some minutes ago, the Organization of American States (OAS),
for the first time in the organization’s history, rejected a major United
States initiative.

The OAS backed, by a vote of 32-0 – with two countries not counted – a
resolution to support the continuance of the democratically elected
government of Hugo Chávez of Venezuela.

This unprecedented result of a fierce, tense, and extended, debate marks an
historic turning point for our América.

The nations of the Western Hemisphere rejected, once and for all, any
attempt at coup d’etat, in Venezuela or elsewhere. Washington’s spoonful of
sugar to make the medicine go down was language backing OAS secretary
general Cesar Gaviria to “find a way to channel positive energies” in
Venezuela.

In a veiled message of “no confidence” for its own secretary general’s
pro-coup efforts in Caracas over the past 15 days, the Organization of
American States equally called upon the Carter Center and the United Nations
to promote dialogue in Venezuela, but not to permit any coup attempt nor
pretension of interrupting democracy; not even by the OAS’s own
representative.

We repeat: 32 American nations tonight, after an unprecedented Authentic
Debate among the members of the Organization of American states, rejected
destabilizing proposals by Washington to impose its policies on another
American country: Venezuela.

The foreign ministries of Mexico and Peru – who had, 48 hours ago, been
willing patsies for Washington in this historic debate - stuck their fingers
in the air, and saw which way the wind was blowing. And by voting with the
majority they kept the door open for their membership in the New American
Union that will gain traction in 2003.

December 16, 2002: The day the empire died.

At press time, we still don’t know which States were the two that did not
vote, or perhaps were not present, for the resolution supported by 32 of 34
American countries that have just turned América right-side-up again. We’ll
find out and get back to you on that.

But we can’t help but add: The end of imposition has profound consequences
for the pro-narco drug policy imposed by Washington on other nations.

Narco News wishes all our readers, correspondents, sources, professors,
students, and allies, a New Year that sneaks up on the old one.

Oh my, it already has.

from somewhere in a country called América,

Al Giordano

Somewhat in response to Ron's recent post, I would like to point out that
winking and joking are different acts.

A joke is something you tell someone to make them laugh. It can also be a
pun, or a burlesque, or purposely tripping over your own shoes.  Jokes are
funny.

A wink can be friendly, as John has pointed out, or sneaky/guileful, as
Arielle has pointed out, but there's nothing inherently funny about it.  A
wink usually says, silently, "you and I know, even if others around us
don't."  If I wink at someone at a party, for instance, they're going to
wonder what knowledge we have in common that the other partygoers don't. A
wink can also say, "It's cool, things are under control here," as in the
Bob Dylan quote above.  A wink also can convey "I don't really mean what
i'm saying"; for instance, the Seinfeld episode where George has a twitch
in his eye that causes him to wink--

WILHELM: George, have you seen Morgan?

GEORGE: No.

WILHELM: He's been coming in late all week. Is there something wrong?

GEORGE: No, not that I know of. (winks)

WILHELM: Really? Make sure he signs this. Oh, look George, if there's a
problem with Morgan you can tell me.

GEORGE: Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)

WILHELM: I understand.

I suppose a wink *after* a joke might be what Ron thinks of as "The
Postmodern Wink of Irony."   But the problem with this phrase is that it
introduces a third concept, irony, and overlays it all with a damned
adjective, "postmodern."  I guess irony might be *indicated* by a wink, but
they aren't the same thing.   In any case, the phrase is still confusing,
and I'm beginning to think it's little more than a cliché.

Arielle's post of Dec 10 proposed a concise explanation of what Ron
actually was relieved not to see in Moxley: "when a poet is using humor,
postmodern referencing, high/low culture intermixing, etc., for the sake of
AVOIDING a question, or trying to ENGAGE with the reader on that level, on
the 'aren't we so clever?' level, rather than the same humor or the same
pomo reference coming from a place of utter sincerity or trying to get to
something really honest."

So, I don't think jokes or pop-culture references are objectionable *per
se*, even decontextualized and obscure---  [when I was 15, I read the Waste
Land without understanding 2/3 of the references, and I still listen to
Pound's Canto recordings without a notion of what the f* he's talking
about; and I recently read & laughed at Piers Ploughman, which assumes its
reader is familiar with its historical moment (and I wasn't), and what
about Dylan Thomas?  It's just music]   --- it is more a matter of the
author's willingness to engage her world, to say what's what, to refer to
stuff, and not to worry what people think about her.

Also, I certainly can't worry about what people will "get" in seventy
years.  That's outlandish. (1) Authors go in and out of fashion, in this
shifting "canon";  (2)  I have enough trouble communicating to people
today.

Thanks, Maria, for putting this up. If poetry's job in part is to quote the
invisible, this piece is "pretty" wicked poetry!
One wonders again about Wellstone and how that plane might have met that
particular fate!  & How much has to be put up for Lott to quit the Senate
and then pray that the Democrats may still have a bone in their body??
Fabulous times!

>>RPT: kalamu in houston
====================

houston, 15 november 2002. american studies association conference. lorenzo
thomas panel. my vehicle is still in the shop awaiting a replacement
engine--the second this year. i've rented a car and make the 5.5 hour drive
over to houston, arriving an hour before my presentation. by the time i find
the location in the galleria and set up, there is still a solid half hour
before hit time. aldon nielson is there. he and i are doing multi-media. he
has an mp3 player and is sharing some audio clips, plus a very brief video
clip from a vhs tape. the honoree lorenzo thomas arrives just as the panel is
about to kick off. organized by barry maxwell of cornell university, the
panel includes, aldon nielson, harryette mullen, maria damon (academic
heavyweights all) and yours truly.

when moderator maxwell asked me to participate on a panel about lorenzo
thomas, my initial impusle was to say "no." i'm through writing papers for
academic panels. no mas. but i have a deep respect and admiration for the
work of lorenzo thomas, plus we know each other from way, way back, so i feel
obliged to do something. my compromise is that i will do a short video on
lorenzo. maxwell  buys my offer.

earlier this year, back in march, i drove over to houston to video interview
lorenzo. we sat in an empty classroom at the university of houston. i wanted
to shoot in his office, but lorenzo felt it was too junky, which is exactly
why i wanted to shoot in there. i guessed there would be books all over the
place, hardly anywhere to walk or sit, a desk overflowing with work in
progress, newspapers, magazines, maybe a bottle of water, a coffee cup
stuffed with pens and pencils, a blinking computer behind the desk. a squat,
black telephone sitting sentry like a hungry bulldog. maybe a window
overlooking nothing in particular. it would have made a great set, offering
all kinds of interesting angles, but lorenzo's sense of propriety kicked in.
he didn't want to look bad. didn't want to come off as the disheveled wacky
professor. so we ended up in the sterility of a harshly lit, box of a
classroom. a whiteboard behind him as he sat at a plastic-topped table.
utterly characterless. it was talking head hell.

after the shoot, lorenzo took me out to a mexican restaurant and we had a
good meal, some engaging conversation and i turned around and got back on the
highway, getting home around midnight. not a bad day's work.

once i looked at the footage i was both astounded and dispirited. astounded
because a lot of what lorenzo had to say was not only interesting, he was
occasionally amazing in how he hooked-up various threads of thought. but the
look of the piece--it hurts my eyes, my sensibility as a movie maker to stare
at a talking head for twenty minutes. and then there was the other problem of
how to boil it all down into a cogent 12-minute piece.

enter jerry ward. professor ward and i have been friends for years and years
and years. in the summer of 2002 he accepted an offer from dillard president
michael lomax to become a distinguished scholar with an endowed chair.
accepting the dillard offer meant jerry would be leaving his long-time
stomping grounds of tougaloo college located on the outskirts of jackson,
mississippi. jerry had been dedicated to tougaloo like a farmer to the land,
but in a typical godfather move, lomax made one of those irrefusable offers.

by august jerry was in new orleans. and in september we began our weekly
monday diner dates. we go to one of the thousands of restaurants or eating
establishments dotting the new orleans landscape and hold court with the
eruditeness of old heads on saturday at the barbershop. we have no specific
agendas, and just talk about whatever we feel like pontificating on. except
jerry is widely read, intellectually sharp, and given to precision in his
pronouncements--hence his nickname: surgeon.

surgeon and i have worked together on a number of projects, including
co-editing two issues of the african american review, which is when we
officially adopted our "noms-de-intellectual guerre." so while he slices and
dices, separating flesh from bone, artery from sinew, i be earning my stripes
with overhead swipes and smashing hammer hits--they call me sledgehammer. so
one evening while we're beating that boy, the idea occurs to me, why not
include a segment with jerry and i deconstructing lorenzo's work. jerry
agrees to be part of the video project.

i select about twenty minutes of the interview that i think are particularly
insightful, burn a vhs tape and give it to jerry for his review. a week later
jerry has made notes and points to four segments. i re-edit the lorenzo
segments and then arrange to video jerry. i take my high school crew over to
dillard and they do the actual shooting. typically, jerry has prepared his
comments. two questions, one-take each, and we're in and out within 45
minutes. i spend about two more days editing, finalizing the cuts, figuring
out how to do the transitions (i end up with page turns when lorenzo goes
from topic to topic), use a hip titling device from a slick (that's actually
the name of the product) plug-in for i-movie, and voila, i'm ready to
participate on an academic panel.

i get the nod to lead-off the panel, followed by harryette mullen who has a
plane to catch, then aldon followed by ms. damon, and then comments from
lorenzo. using a video as my contribution is a little different for an
academic panel, and the video is well received.  following the video, i make
a brief statement about the three major revolutions in the recording of
speech. first came writing and the printing press, which stripes away sound
and gesture. then at the turn of the 20th century came recording and radio,
which added back sound. the opening of the 21st century brings us digital
video you can edit on personal computers, that brings back gesture. the
importance of all of this is that african american culture is sound-intensive
and gesture-sensitive, or to put it another way, there can be no appreciation
of black culture without hearing it.

harryette follows with a paper that is both analytical and anecdotal, and
more importantly, she also points to music. (a couple of days after the
panel, mullen, nielson and damon email copies of their papers to all of the
panelists.) here is a long quote from mullen's presentation:

>>In 1967 in a poem titled "Onion Bucket," he wrote "All silence says music
will follow," suggesting to me a dialectical relationship between life and
death, between art and the void of meaninglessness, and suggesting to any
blocked writer that the blank page is ready to receive our creation. In the
poetry of Lorenzo Thomas, there is often an implicit soundtrack behind the
words, an allusive, unheard but remembered music that helps to establish the
mood, location, or social context of a given moment of the poet's observant
participation. The musical influences so pervasive in his poetry include
jazz, blues, R & B, rock, reggae, calypso, zydeco, disco, country western,
western classical music, even Muzak.  Often some particular musical allusion
allows the poet to define intimate or social space, or the speaker in the
poem may borrow a theme or a rhetorical stance from a specific type of music,
as in "Blues Cadet" and "MMDCCXIII 1/2." (The title of the latter appears to
be a street address, 2713 1/2, written in Roman numerals.) In these poems,
whether the blues is directly or indirectly evoked, and whether or not the
poem itself includes blues allusions, the space of home is defined as a blues
space whenever the poet sings of emotional discord and estrangement as
individuals fail to connect. The poet sings the blues when love is off-key
and a house is not a home. In "Blues Cadet," with its title and its epigraph
"after Sonny Boy Williamson" we are alerted to the poem's origins in the
blues. The colloquial voice, intimate address to an absent love, and
household metaphors of the poem's troubled speaker would be appropriate for a
traditional blues singer: "I've worn out the pictures on the carpet/Just
pacing in my room//Ever since you went away." In "2713 1/2" something close
to a classical metrical pattern can be felt in the lines, yet under this
speaker's more formal diction it is still possible to hear the blues:<<

nielson than ups the music ante. first he plays a musical excerpt, the beach
boys doing surfing usa. and follows with chuck berry's original "sweet little
sixteen" thereby illustrating the source, but then going further and
deconstructing the whole context. again i quote at some length:

    >>Brian Wilson once explained to an interviewer from Time magazine:
"We're not colored; we're white.  And we sing white" (qtd. in Kirsch, 2).
The real story was, as it always is in America's racial cosmology,
considerably more complicated than the Beach Boys allowed.  Lorenzo Thomas
would have recognized that on first hearing.  "Surfing U.S.A." had as
co-author none other than Chuck Berry, whose melody, blues progression,
patented guitar licks and even idealistic, adolescent longing are at the core
of what Brian Wilson made from the materials of Berry's composition "Sweet
Little Sixteen."  Berry and the Beach Boys, too, shared a common shore of
enunciation.  The hard "R" sounds and wide open vowels of Brian Wilson's
plain statement resemble nothing so much as the dialect of the plains, the
natural affect of Missourians like Melvin B. Tolson and Chuck Berry.  (It's a
sound that marks the Beach Boys apart from the Oakie inflected pronunciation
of so many of their neighbors, not to mention the Armenian strains of
contemporaries of theirs such as Cher.)  This, unlike the musical
appropriations, was not a matter of conscious mimicry, the sort of thing that
explains why so many fifteen-year-old white boys in Iowa now sound as though
they'd grown up in the Bronx.  But it does raise a rather obvious question:
when white people say that someone sounds "black," what do they really mean?
Brian Wilson says he sings white, and if that means that he sounds a lot like
Chuck Berry, then we need to wonder just what is fit music for an America
always at war with its own racial present?<<

what is totally tickling me is how the "literary" analysis is focusing on
music, thereby reinforcing the centrality of sound in black culture.

the last presentation was by maria damon, and although she offers a more
traditional literary exposition, her emphasis on "witnessing" (or as she
wittily notes, lorenzo is a poet who puts the "wit back into witness," which
is rap-like in its word play) establishes the cultural context within which
sound is supreme. again, i quote at length:

>>In mainstream, or , to use Lorenzo Thomas's terminology, Eurocentric modern
lyric poetry, the poet witnesses his or her own consciousness, the processes
of observation and experience themselves, and comments on them. This private
process, made public in suitably lovely language, ratifies the poet as a
special, sensitive person who represents the ideal of the self-knowing human:
 an auto-erotic Socratic exhibition for the intellectual voyeur.  What falls
out of the equation for the most part is history, context, the social world.
In this mainstream poetic arena, the private contract between the poet,
performing for him or herself but disingenuously conscious of being under
surveillance, and an audience hungry for personal insight, is a
psycho-emotional one; if history intrudes, it functions as a "background"
setting, insisted on, if at all, by the harsh, flat-footed critic,
academically trained in the last 30 years perhaps, to bring "cultural
context" into the picture to muddy the waters and tamper with the proper
perspective of this private, self-regarding metaphysical striptease.
Fortunately, Lorenzo Thomas, the poets to whom he devotes his analytic
energies, and the poetic scenes he documents and participates in are not
mainstream or Eurocentric.  For Thomas, Afrocentric poetry is historiography,
and Afrocentric literary historiography is a form of *social* witnessing.  As
social and subjective witnessing are not separate events --that is, the
poet's subjectivity has itself been touched by social trauma --the stakes are
higher.  To write literary history is to take extraordinary measures to
ensure survival; to write the extraordinary linear measures of poetry is to
link one's own survival to that of one's community. To write history through
poetry and a poetic historiography is to knit oneself even more closely to
community.  Healing the split between history and poetry, literary history,
itself a poetics, can be a way of situating poetic practice in a social
context --one's own.  By looking at Lorenzo Thomas's literary historiography,
we get a sense of how a poet's rendition of history foregrounds the poetics
of community formation and historical transformation.<<

after the four presentations, lorenzo briefly responded. he was thankful for
everyone's contribution. it was a great panel with thoughtful and insightful
commentaries. i was not only extremely pleased to participate, i also really
enjoyed myself while listening to critics who were good at doing what lorenzo
said on the videotape is one of the roles of the critic: to make clear what
one gets from a particular piece of literary work.

my view of the future suggests that what is commonly called "multi-media"
will be used more and more often as we realize two factors: one--multi-media
is now accessible to everyone, you can use recordings, make movies, present
slides and carry it all to the presentation in handheld computers, audio
players and projection devices. two--multi-media enables a more accurate
explication of black culture, a culture that can not be fully understood if
one does not hear it. i believe the use of multi-media will not only
facilitate presentations about black culture, more importantly multi-media
will make it possible for a new type of critic to emerge, a critic who is
grounded in sound, equal to if not moreso than being grounded in text.

think of what happened with music in the 20th century. once the technology of
sound reproduction was effected, the dominance of classical music was ended
as black music came to the fore thanks to records and radio. without
recording and broadcast technology there would not have been a worldwide
musical revolution because one can not appreciate or learn black music
without hearing it. classical music can be passed on through written scores,
but there is no manuscript that can represent blues and jazz, nor gospel or
rhythm and blues, not to mention the current scene. try to imagine rap music
represented  as a musical score on paper.

my neo-griot concept is one of writing with text, sound and light. as far as
i am concerned records and movies are a form of writing, a way to concretize
language and make it possible for the audience to receive the message in the
absence of the author presenting the message in real time. moreover,
multimedia enables those who are proficient at the presentation of sound and
visuals to represent themselves with authority rather than relying solely on
those whose forte is words on paper.

as a writer i have a lot of respect for and proficiency with using text, but
i am also aware that the dominance of text has been to the detriment of our
culture not only in terms of the presentation of the culture but also in
terms of the criteria that determine who is an expert, a critic. often a
critic is considered an authority because they are proficient at writing, not
because they have a real understanding of the culture, but now with
multimedia, we can not only focus on the culture, we also enable other forms
of intellectual insight. the ph.d. is no longer privileged just because they
are adept at writing.

we are on the verge of the third major revolution in writing. multi-media in
general and especially digital technology (particularly digital video)
levels the playing field and makes it possible for non-textual languages to
compete in all arenas. the lorenzo thomas panel exemplified the potential
effectiveness of the multi-media third wave, and this was only the beginning.

personally, it became clear to me that the making of movies is not only a
realistic alternative to writing a paper, digital videos are in fact able to
present facets that text can't. to be clear, what i am calling for is not the
elimination of text, but rather the addition of sound and gesture to text as
a form of writing. i want to be proficient in all three areas, and i think
that we all can use digital multimedia to now more fully and accurately
represent black culture.

on the long drive back to new orleans that night, my imagination was buzzing,
thinking about all the possibilities in terms of using digital video. next
week i head out to san antonio for the guadeloupe inter-america bookfair and
literary festival. report to come...

Jordan Davis inquit:

"Any other poets been featured in ads playing during
the Super Bowl since then?"

Jordan, it's funny you should mention that. Two poets from McLean Co. (home
of the Adlai Stevensons) here in Illinois were featured in a Verizon
commercial last month, one of them wore a sandwich board that read
"Language Poet" and the other wore a sandwich board that read "Post-Avant
Poet." (I'M NOT KIDDING.) They did a "simultaneous audit/recitation." They
stood in their respective livingrooms facing each other across a suburban
driveway, each in front of a huge picture window, visible to the other, and
they each read their work outloud into the phone while listening to the
other's poem. The caption under them blinked "simultaneous performance."
Both poets looked sort of cross-eyed and not too bright. Everything was
very addled. They kind of acted like robots. It reminded me of that old
band "Devo."

Anyway, at the end, this plum, baritone, calm voice rides up and says,
"Verizon. Talk as much as you want. Even if no one's listening. We
encourage it."

It was actually one of the best commercials I've seen in a while. Very
funny. If a little close to the bone.

Filmmaker Michael Moore's E-mail Intercepted/Home Searched by Secret Service
http://www.sianews.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=458
(The Story of a Vietnam Vet Caught in a Government / Celebrity
Surveillance Crossfire)
by Tom Flocco
December 17, 2002
In a not-so-cryptic "message" eventually intended for all U.S.
citizens -- but likely one very famous American in particular, three
armed U.S. Secret Service agents and a local sheriff employed
psychological intimidation to invade the privacy of retired U.S. Navy
Chief Petty Officer Michael Moore, 49, of Goldston, North Carolina at
his home on December 10, 2002...

In another warning sign of what lies ahead for all Americans
regarding police-state abuse of power (thanks to sections of the
post-September 11 "Patriot Act" approved by Congress and signed into
law by President Bush), U.S. Intelligence intercepted North
Carolinian Michael Moore's email -- likely believing it was written
by independent film producer-icon ("Bowling for Columbine") and
author ("Stupid White Men") Michael Moore. Inother words, they got
the wrong Michael Moore.

The Michael Moore raided by the Secret Service last week is a 20-year
war veteran who put his life on the line for his country during two
separate tours of duty aboard the U.S.S. Paul Revere off the coast of
Vietnam in 1971 and 1972 -- one of which was a highly dangerous
mine-sweeping operation...

Hey Ram,


Eleni and I are planning to go to New York for two months, arriving
sometime between Jan. 19 and Feb. 1.  I'm writing in the hopes that you
may know someone who is renting an apartment for this period, or who
would like someone to take care of theirs while away.  Since we're
bringing our small dog (approx. 15 pounds), Sparks, we'd like to be in a
relatively quiet neighborhood, so we were thinking perhaps Brooklyn
Heights or somewhere near there.  Manhattan is ok if we can find a quiet
corner.  Ideally the apartment would be two bedrooms or larger (one
bedroom and two small offices would be perfect).   If anyone has
suggestions on apartment agencies that are ok that'd also be helpful.

I regret having not seen this topic until now; our power was out for 3 days.
I am sorry that Ron feels so isolated. That is insees part of the experience
of mental illness. Though I read every message of his, I do not recalll one
that could be responsible for my having so missed the point as to cause me
to remain silent where support was called for. The sense of isolation that
accompanies some mental illness is terrible, and if I could locate the
thread, I should like to tell Ron that he is not so alone.  But it is all so
cryptic; assumptions have been made, but to me it is not clear how or why.I
see Trent Lott's name--at least, Lott's; I assume this is not Ronnie Lott,
the African American Football star, who married my friend Karen---but in a
sentence that is upset that his mental illness has gone unrecognised......or
upset that it hasn't? Is it ossible to get some update on this topic?  David

Each one of us has something unique to give. Cars
become mobile environments; comfortably entombed,
drivers experience travel as the unfurling of a
landscape remote from themselves.  The walkman defines
a personal sphere of music; the cellphone, a
but-for-thou solipsism (there are customers at the
store in which I work who never leave the confines of
that personal, fantasmally communicative sphere during
the whole transaction; there's no-one at either end of
the circuit, the cashier is a void function, not to be
greeted or conversed with,  just as the cashier
suspects that the customer's conversational partner is
also a void function, only there to stamp community as
another commodity conspicuously consumed).
        The saddest ones are the ones with no cellphone, the
ones who keep their silent negation of the cashier
with no diversion. They toss their goods on the
counter, spill their money in a  scattering fan of
abyss; I'm nothing to them, even then...
        Everyone can make a significant and heartfelt
contribution to American pride.

"The moon," I thread through Baby's lips, "is walking
toward the counter with a cart stiff with milk. Bulbs
in a store can dizzy a skin until the regular bleat of
the register replaces the heart. Milk fumbles from
cart to counter, the old moon grunting with  each
gallon. Baby watches wrinkles around the old moon's
eyes pant for the hard shaft of light that lies hotly
down inside them."
        "But Baby," she stitches across my mouth, "isn't all
light in a store urgent for logos?"
        "Only lies could be so beautiful,"  I embroider from
Baby's tongue. "The moon is beautiful because he is a
lie. An exclamation of the most pedestrian rouge dots
his cheeks; plastic lashes clatter on powdered flesh.
He's switched the price tags of all his products to
lower prices; the coupons won't even scan..."

The process of arriving at fairly firm critical judgment, consensus, is very
slow. I notice, in doing my own work, that most of my writing tends to
appear unsatisfying to me shortly after I write it. I've learned to put it
away and review it much later; sometimes, then, I feel happier with it.
Occasionally, the original judgments stick. People  are probably frequently
tempted to write evaluations of contemporary poetry to counter or share
someone else's enthusiasm. If I like someone's work, of course I want to get
the word out. Someone else might want to counter that opinion, of course.
Sometimes I have to be reminded to work at understanding and appreciating
excellent, but difficult, work. For some reason I think of Zukofsky. Ammiel
Alcalay's work is not easy, but the effort to get with it usually pays off.
It just irks me when very interesting work like that of Sondheim, Highland,
Lacook and others right here on the list are rejected out of hand. Often,
what is called -bad- is just -difficult-. Yes, sometimes it is just -bad-,
read -uninteresting- and stays that way. But who knows how much work it
takes to break through to what is terrific in someone's work? I learned a
lot when I was asked to be a judge for a couple of poetry awards and had to
look at hundreds of manuscripts over time. I noticed that my opinions, as
they should, changed  as I was rereading. I have frequently been very
surprised to find out how much I like certain work if I put in that extra
time and come back to it again and again. Check out the work of Bob Harrison
if you come across it in magazines; or Jen Hofer; a bit of effort might
really pay off. With Sheila Murphy's work I kind of noticed it out of the
corner of my eye for years. Gradually, the momentum built up to a
realization that her work almost always delights me. The same for Kathleen
Fraser. I've always liked and admired Ann Lauterbach's work very much. But
when I read her recent collection -If In Time- I was knocked out. This new
book is more than a selection; it is a rerendering, I might say even a
fascinating autocritical appraisal, a retrospective. All of this takes time,
as the title implies, and some of it is not always fun, but can be
painstaking work including a degree of very worthwhile risk.

By the way, Ron Silliman mentioned David Markson in a recent entry in his
Blog. I want to second the motion and recommend -Reader's Block- and -This
Is Not A Novel- along with Ron's recommendation of -Wittgenstein's
Mistress-.I can also, amazingly, recommend virtually every Krupskaya book,
mostly first books, including the recent -Sugar Pill- by Drew Gardner. If
you're looking for stocking stuffers how about Keith Waldrop's incredible
-Semiramis If I Remember- Avec- and Kenny Goldsmith's -Head Citations-The
Figures? Wow. And when was the last time you looked through the ever
mounting amazing Green Integer-don't miss Rodrigo Toscano's The
Disparities-and Granary catalogues-especially the recent -Turning Leaves of
Mind by Ligorano and Reese with Gerrit Lansing, not to mention the latest
and possibly last issue of Ribot the-Lazy- issue-number 8 in this series of
beautifully printed magazines with quite a lot of interesting art.

Since I'm in the mood for naming some names the other night I went to what
was probably up there with the greatest readings I've ever heard. It was
Steve McCaffery at the Boesky Gallery this past Saturday night. If you've
never heard this guy read get a copy of a CD or a cassette. And if you've
never read his Roof book -North of Intention- you've missed one of the great
critical reads. He also showed some very witty and brilliant films.

No great claims are made for the completeness of this list or the expertise
involved or the finality of the opinions here expressed! Just what's on my
mind right now...And please, save the -bad- and -good- words for the 5 years
and younger set in your life. Oh yes, and for getting those puppies to use
the paper!

Aaron. I hope and prey that you have not..since your reading of Ron's gate
keeping Blogg...contracted the dreaded Anxiety of Blinkfluence? Actually I
think Ron is a cunning fox (he may be worried that he himself will go out of
fashionor whatever...I share your reading experiences (I  just mistyped in
or with my Freudian fingers "dreading experiences!!"...I also enjoyed Eliot
before eg I had even read The Odyssey .... I recall being rather panick
stricken about all the things in Greek, Italian, and French and I'm just
recently "tackling " The Cantos (armed with a glossary -   but ultimately I
intend to fling that aside!) I've just been enjoying Barbara Guest with no
very exact idea of what she is "saying".... it is indeed the deep music of
poetry that ultimately counts I feel.
  But I recall a conversation with Alan Loney (who is a poet here and has
been an editor and printer) that at one stage people would send him writings
claiming that they were Post Modern...(a problematic term as you
indicate)..possibly to get "on his side " and he said to me:  "But they
werent"  ( I paled inwardly..perhaps I too am not Post Modern!!!)...now he
might have been right: eg to his understading of what was "original" or
innovative or Post Modern or whatever the right term is: but of course
nowadays, much as I admire Alan as a writer.....every editor or critic is
(and has to be) constantly subject to evaluation and re-evaluation: I find
it hard to write poetry that is not lineated (an example only of one aspect
of course) but I write now more deliberately...that said I just relax, or
try to: I cant artifically alter my style to "conform" to any thing  (I'm
not saying that that is what Ron wants - I'm sure he doesnt) but there is
feeling I have anyway that I "should" be "innovative" or "postmodern"
somewhow and that means a) a certain "distortion" of my "natural" flow  (not
neccesarily bad as it can open my poetry up to new forms without -
hopefully - sacrificing my own uniqueness)  b)  at least I'm on the lookout,
alert to posssible "wetnesses" (hard to see one's own work though)
    Perhaps Ron's entire production is in fact based on the Philosophy of
The Wink?    He's a cunning artificer!  Maybe he stole The Wink from another
poet?   Can he Wink? Is in fact his Alphabet actually ...can  it not be
summated into one single Wink?  (the poetic  equivalent of Thevinem's
Theorem in electricity!!!)  Sorry to be flippant!! Well, not sorry, I AM
enjoying Ron's Blogg though,  as far as it goes, but I more or less ignored
the part about Moxley ..her name isnt very promising!  Cheers, Richard.
  Richard.

Lawrence, I was just trying to use a kind of lazy but neutral shorthand to
refer to conventions that I think are prevalent.  I do something similar
when I want  to speak of "speech-based autobiographical lyricism."
Obviously these kinds of abbreviation aren't worth very much.  Number me
among those who prefer to look at individual cases, anomalous cases.

As for the incomplete sentence...

"Sentence" is apparently related to the Latin "sentire," meaning aware.
What if there were the gist of a truth in this etymological kinship?
Incomplete sentence = limited awareness?  Or awareness without limits,
boundless awareness?  Perhaps a dog's awareness.  "My bowl."  "My bed."
"Smell of piss in the shrubbery."  I'm kidding.  But.

"Disjunction," "parataxis": using these techniques usually means writing in
verbless phrases rather than sentences.  You can see the origin of the
phrase-based style in the modernists.  But compare Pound with Susan Howe:

These are the stones of foundation
J. A.'s reply to the Governor
Impeachment of Oliver
These stones we built on
I don't receive a shilling a month, wrote Mr Adams to Abigail in seventeen 74
June 7th. approve of committee from the several colonies
Bowdoin, Cushing, Sam Adams, John A. and Paine (Robert)
'mope, I muse, I ruminate' le
personnel manque we have not men for the times
Cut the overhead my dear wife and keep yr/ eye on the dairy

Strange fear of sleep
am bafflement gone
Bat winged dim dawn
herthe midmost wide

Pound wants to say "this is," "this is," "this is" -- "THESE are the STONES
of FOUNDATION" -- but then he gets things moving again with a quick action
verb: "cut the overhead."  Howe is obviously more static, although she too
can write beautiful sentences, as we all know.

I get the feeling -- which may be totally wrong -- that younger poets in
this tradition are moving back in the direction of, shall we say, fullness
of grammar.  Opening at random Catherine Wagner's book Miss America, I read:

Is there a Kenmore, Penny Kenmore for ex
Or maybe it means "extremely canny"
I wrote a joke postcard first time in New York
Age 16 -- "I've been discovered
As Pretty Plus model for Sears Catalog"

(Ken more = more canny?)  I think there's something intrinsically more
canny about complete rather than incomplete -- something good takes place
in the head when subject and verb are joined.

'GOOD''BAD' Poetry--what a static opposition. A poem is good as you find it
so--and may be bad in five years, or by tomorrow. Is this a list of would-be
poets, or rather,of must-be anthologists?
                     I have doted on poems I blush to recall. (some, by me.)
I'm sorry, mates, but it's an inconstant world. "Bright star, would I were
steadfast as thou art".   Ah, but "I" am not. Bad poetry is unreadable, so
how can one know it is bad? I spent an evening with John Ashbery reading
aloud the works of William McGonagal, I think he was named. Yes, he wrote
badly, but it was so bad it was good.  David

Today's News


... the Daniel F. Beatty, Washington, N.J., U.S.A. Golden Tongue 61-key
14-stop pump organ, gold labeling on black above the keyboard, was found
between 3rd and 4th Avenue on a Dean Street sidewalk, trimmings and back
removed and leaning against the main framework, around 4:30 the afternoon
of Thursday, December 19th, 2002, and brought to the corner of Dean Street
and 5th Avenue, at 432, around 5:40 in the evening of the same day, by
Azure Carter, Alan Sondheim, and Mark Esper, where Gary Wiebke was
discovered coming into the same establishment, and his help solicited, to
the effect that Azure Carter carried the properly-cut Victorian trimmings
to the third floor, while Gary Wiebke and Mark Esper carried the 125-kilo
instrument, dating from late 1878 or early 1879, judging by the serial
number, up two flights of stairs and into Azure Carter's and Alan
Sondheim's apartment, while Azure Carter and Alan Sondheim cleared a
passage in order to eventually move and re-assemble the walnut, ivory- and
ebony-keyed small parlor organ, whose bellows and suction box were still
intact, by replacing the trimmings and reattaching the back, removing,
however, the outdated electric motor, preferring instead to utilize the
original and still-functioning pedals to good effect, as the marvelous
sonority of Forte, Coupled, Viola, and Sub-Bass floated over their space,
the instrument clearly played properly and for the first time in a
century ...

But suppose one is trying to present the landscape rather than moralize
about it. Both are at times ok to do, but they may require different techne.

David  Did you see my satiriacal  "I met..." and it was about my "picture"
of John Ashbery and Robert Kelly, I'm wondering how close I got to the
reality! What Isaid will be "buried" somewhere on the archives so dont worry
about it....your a very different 9thta s the key not good or bad but
differnet and why and what appeals etc) poet to John Ashbery who I
"discovered" when I was "getting back into poetry" in about 1989 I found
"House Boat" days (the first modern poet I had read with any atention since
I read Eliot (I hadnt heard of WCW or Olson or any one else except Pound and
cmmings (... I thought Pound and Eliot were British) I was about 44 ... at
first I couldnt make head nor tail of it - in fact i read some of it aloud
to a freind I had then and we laughed a lot: it seemed very funny (as quite
a lot of Ashbery still does) but something about Ashbery's work fascinates
me still (altough I dont read him just at the moment) and I think for me he
is - of the non- Lang poets etc he is something special (as was O'Hara ) of
course there are other extraordinary poets but he has a special
significance...his poetry wont become "bad" he seems almost incapable of
writing poorly: however I dont know how I can justify that ..... but I think
that many of the Langpos and their "offshoots" or whatever are
exatrordinary...in NZ we have some ingenious poets: but if US  Political
leaders leave a lot to be desired your art and lit scene is extarordinarily
rich..going back to where?..Dickinson and Whitman etc (unfortuately these
are in Bloom's canon which is  a bit sad) ...

If I'm more fiscal ext year I want to acquire more of the new writing and
some of such as yourself (I already got Nick Piombino's book and I have
Susan Howe, some of Bernstein, Silliman, Heijinian, Guest (and I have to
confess I have a mass of stuff that I could not obtain cheaply or reasonably
or easily so I photocopied a lot of books entire) however I bought as many
as I could afford ... I obtained two books by Kelly, I have Zukofsky and so
on. I also like Berryman.  But there are many many good poets nowadays
throughout the world: possibly more than ever.

I think we all know somewhow who are good (although here even poets who like
what I do disagree on the merits of poets we both like else) so on its
problematic this "good" and "bad"  McGonnagel....I suppose it depends on
what people want from poetry. Compare it to music: I always listen to the
Concert Programme (its the only radio or TV station (apart from one other)
here that doesnt bombard me with endless advertising and other drivel called
"programmes"  and all  else  otherwise  is very weak (I feel!) and my mother
might object to some (contemporary music) we were hearing ( that might be a
bit strange or dissonant etc) by saying that "I dont like this"... but I
would sometimes say..."well, so far, nor do, I but I cant tell  what its
about or whether it interests me until I've listened to it right through"
(poor old Mum she had to put up with me at home here until 1998 whe she
died) and like poetry we often say "good" or bad at one listening (reading)
...to get the most from a poem is often hard work: it can be, and that hard
work can be rewarding -not always - but sufficiently.   Cheers, Richard

A very simple web site for the careds I desigbn and sometimes sell is at
www.sporkworld.org/cards

Note that this is not my web design, but rather Photoshop's automatic slide
show design.

Some of these images were taken for an as yet incomplete web art project,
and I feel weird selling them...there seems to be a difference between art
and e-commerce and I'm crossing the line!  yeeks!

Millie

P.S. order lots of cards :-)

Having filled the 1 gigabyte of storage allotted for the Factory
School digital audio archive, it's time to think about what to remove
as I'd like to cycle new audio files in over next few weeks.
Eventually, all of the files will be available somewhere, but for now
I need some feedback as to what to keep on-line and what to move
temporarily off-line until arrangements can be made.

Since I know that folks from more than twenty countries regularly
visit the archive, I'm worried about disruptions in service. While
site reports allow me to know which are the most popular files (top
30 by month), please let me know (back-channel, thanks) which files
you currently use or need for teaching purposes. I know from these
reports which files get used the most, so another way to 'vote' would
be to click on your favorite poet reading her/his work. But I am
concerned about files that may not appear on the popularity radar.

Thanks for your help.  http://www.factoryschool.org

Also, would Eric Baus, Jeff Davis, Mike Boughn and Laura Wright
please drop me a note privately? These folks, and anyone else who
makes a donation of tapes, will receive the entire archive on 2
disks-- about 600 files.

>>                  A CALL FOR A NEW, DEMOCRATIC U.S. FOREIGN POLICY
>>
>>   We oppose the impending U.S.-led war on Iraq, which threatens to
inflict vast suffering and destruction, while exacerbating rather
than resolving threats toregional and global peace. Saddam Hussein is
a tyrant who should be removed from power, both for the good of the
Iraqi people and for the security of neighboring countries. However,
it is up to the Iraqi people themselves to oust Saddam Hussein,
dismantle his police state regime, and democratize their country.
People in the United States can be of immense help in this
effort--not by supporting military intervention, but by building a
strong peace movement and working to ensure that our government
pursues a consistently democratic and just foreign policy.

We do not believe that the goal of the approaching war against Iraq
is to bring democracy to the Iraqis, nor that it will produce this
result. Instead, the Bush Administration=92s aim is to expand and
solidify U.S. predominance in the Middle East, at the cost of tens of
thousands of civilian lives if necessary. This war is about U.S.
political, military and economic power, about seizing control of
oilfields and about strengthening the United States as the enforcer
of an inhumane global status quo. That is why we are opposed to war
against Iraq, whether waged unilaterally by Washington or by the UN
Security Council, unaccountable to the UN General Assembly and
bullied and bribed into endorsing the war.

>The U.S. military may have the ability to destroy Saddam Hussein,
>but the United States cannot promote democracy in the Muslim world
>and peace in the
>Middle East, nor can it deal with the threat posed to all of us by terrorist
>networks such as Al Qaeda, and by weapons of mass destruction, by pursuing its
>current policies. Indeed, the U.S. could address these problems only by doing
>the opposite of what it is doing today -- that is, by:
>
>  -Renouncing the use of military intervention to extend and consolidate
>U.S.imperial power, and withdrawing U.S. troops from the Middle East.
>
>-Ending its support for corrupt and authoritarian regimes, e.g. Saudi
Arabia, the Gulf states and Egypt.

>-Opposing, and ending U.S. complicity in, all forms of terrorism
>worldwide --not just by Al Qaeda, Palestinian suicide bombers and
>Chechen hostage takers, but also by Colombian paramilitaries, the
>Israeli military in the Occupied Territories and Russian
>counterinsurgency forces in Chechnya.
>
>-Ending the cruel sanctions on Iraq, which inflict massive harm on the
>civilian population.
>
>-Supporting the right of national self-determination for all peoples
>in the Middle East, including the Kurds, Palestinians and Israeli
>Jews. Ending one-sided support for Israel in the Palestinian-Israeli
>conflict.
>
>-Taking unilateral steps toward renouncing weapons of mass destruction,
>including nuclear weapons, and vigorously promoting international
>disarmament treaties.
>
>-Abandoning IMF/World Bank economic policies that bring mass misery
>to people in large parts of the world. Initiating a major foreign
>aid program directed at popular rather than corporate needs.
>
>A U.S. government that carried out these policies would be in a
>position to honestly and consistently foster democracy in the Middle
>East and elsewhere. It could encourage democratic forces (not
>unrepresentative cliques, but genuinely popular parties and
>movements) in Iraq, Iran and Syria, as well as
Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and Turkey. Some of
these forces exist today, others have yet to arise, but all would
flower if nurtured by a new U.S. foreign policy.

>These initiatives, taken together, would constitute a truly
>democratic foreign policy. Only such a policy could begin to reverse
>the mistrust and outright hatred felt by so much of the world=92s
>population toward the U.S. At the same time, it would weaken the
>power of dictatorships and the appeal of terrorism and reactionary
>religious fundamentalism. Though nothing the United States
>can do would decisively undermine these elements right away, over time a new
U.S foreign policy would drastically undercut their power and influence.

>The Administration's frantic and flagrantly dishonest efforts to
portray Saddam Hussein as an imminent military threat to people in
this country and to the inhabitants of other Middle Eastern countries
lack credibility. Saddam Hussein is a killer and serial aggressor who
would doubtless like nothing better than to wreak vengeance on the
U.S. and to dominate the Gulf Region. But there is no reason to
believe he is suicidal or insane. Considerable evidence suggests that
Saddam Hussein is much weaker militarily than he was before the Gulf
War and that he is still some distance from being able to manufacture
nuclear weapons.

>But most important, unlike Al Qaeda, he has a state and a position
>of power to protect; he knows that any Iraqi act of aggression now
>against the U.S. or his neighbors would bring about his total
>destruction. As even CIA Director George Tenet has pointed out, it
>is precisely the certainty of a war to the finish
>against his regime that would provide Saddam Hussein with the
>incentive he now lacks to use whatever weapons he has against the
>U.S. and its allies.
>  >
>Weapons of mass destruction endanger us all and must be eliminated.
>But a war against Iraq is not the answer. War threatens massive harm
>to Iraqi civilians, will add to the ranks of terrorists throughout
>the Muslim world, and will encourage international bullies to pursue

Marjorie Cook Poetry Festival & Conference September 18-21, 2003
Miami University, Oxford, Ohio

In conjunction with the Marjorie Cook Poetry Festival of readings by
nationally prominent African American poets, Miami University's
creative writing program will host a conference on "Diversity in
African American Poetry."

Plenary address by:

        Lorenzo Thomas

Scheduled readers/speakers include:

        Elizabeth Alexander
        Wanda Coleman
        Terrance Hayes
        Nathaniel Mackey
        Tracie Morris
        Harryette Mullen
        Mendi Obadike-Lewis
        Claudia Rankine
        James Richardson
        Sonia Sanchez
        Reginald Shepherd
        Evie Shockley
        Timothy Seibles
        Lorenzo Thomas
        Natasha Trethewey
        Quincy Troupe
        Crystal Williams
        Tyrone Williams

In a recent panel discussion regarding "What's African-American about
African-American Poetry," poet-scholar Harryette Mullen warned: "In
our anxiety to embody or represent authentic black identity, we may
impoverish our cultural heritage and simplify the complexity of our
historical experience. As poets and as people of African descent, we
are in danger of only performing blackness, rather than exploring the
infinite permutations of our lived experience and creative
imagination as black people." Surveying the flourishing poetic
landscape, we conclude that many American poets of African descent
have negotiated such dangers successfully. All of the most visible
schools of contemporary poetic practice include distinguished
African American poets. There are also many successful African
American poets whose work does not fit easily within any of the
categories by which American poetry has been sorted by critics and
publicists.  Our conference seeks to explore the complex variety of
experiences, expressions, experiments, and influences represented in
"African American poetry" and thus prevent this overarching category
from obscuring the stylistic diversity of individual artists or
imposing an identity politics upon those who may prefer to define
their writing according to other criteria. Papers and panels that
will help us foster an appreciation of diversity in African American
poetry are welcome.  Planned topics for roundtable discussion by
invited poets and scholars include:

        African American Performance Poetry and the Beat Legacy
        Experimentalism in African American Poetry
        Formalism in African American Poetry
        Uses of Narrative in African American Poetry

We welcome papers and panel proposals on specific schools and
movements, genres and forms, artistic influences, theoretical
approaches, individual African American poets, and related topics
including but not limited to:

        the Black Arts movement
        the role of anthologies in defining an African American poetry
        the influence of jazz, blues, funk, rap, hip-hop, and other
                musical genres
        canonization/marginalization/recovery
        the long African American poem
        what's African about American poetry?
        "double consciousness" and lyric identity
        ideolectical poetry
        hypertextual poetry

Several panel sessions will be devoted to readings by younger
well-published African American poets. An evening open mike period
will be scheduled.

Please submit 15-minute papers, 200-word abstracts, or
3-to-4-presenter panel proposals by Tuesday, April 1, 2003 to:
Andrew Osborn DAAP Department of English 356 Bachelor Hall Miami
University Oxford, OH 45056 osbornal@muohio.edu

Electronic submission strongly encouraged. Please include the
acryonym "DAAP" in your subject line.  When convenient, include
submitted text in the body of your message; any attachments should be
in rich text format.

Here's one prophet who's honored in his hometown--

from this ayem's NYT

Criticized Poet Is Named Laureate of Newark Schools
By ANDREW JACOBS


NEWARK, Dec. 18 — In an act of defiance aimed at the state's political establishment, the school board here has anointed Amiri
Baraka the district's poet laureate at a time the state is trying to take the same designation away from him.

The unanimous vote by the nine-member advisory board comes as Mr. Baraka, the poet laureate of New Jersey, is under fire for a poem
he wrote last year suggesting that Israel had advance knowledge of the plot to attack the World Trade Center.

A longtime Newark resident who was pivotal in the Black Arts Movement of the 1960's, Mr. Baraka has ignored calls from Gov. James E.
McGreevey and others that he resign the post, which pays a stipend of $10,000. The governor does not have the power to remove the
laureate mantle, but legislative leaders in Trenton said they had enough votes to dissolve the post entirely when they meet after
the New Year. If that should fail, there are more than a half-dozen other bills meant to strip Mr. Baraka of the two-year position,
which he has held since August.

The school board's decision, made during a sparsely attended meeting late last month and reported today by The Star-Ledger of
Newark, quickly reignited passions that were only just beginning to subside.

"What Amiri Baraka has both written and said is clearly, patently inappropriate for children," said Shai Goldstein, New Jersey
regional director of the Anti-Defamation League. "To make a decision to expose children to this kind of bigotry is a cause for great
sadness." Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the governor, agreed, saying the appointment "just boggles the mind."

But there were few voices of condemnation in Newark, where Mr. Baraka, 67, remains one of the city's best known and beloved
citizens. Many elected officials, like Councilman Donald Bradley, praised the board's decision, saying it brought much-needed
attention to Mr. Baraka's expansive body of work and his years of devotion to the city's beleaguered public schools through poetry
workshops and readings.

"Even though he's written some controversial things, he has his First Amendment rights and he's done some wonderful things for
Newark," Mr. Bradley said.

For members of the elected board, which plays an advisory role in a school system still run by the state, the resolution honoring
Mr. Baraka, a graduate of Newark schools, was an act of solidarity. At the previous meeting, the board passed a resolution calling
on the Legislature to read the poem from beginning to end.

"When someone is under attack unjustifiably, that's the time you have to speak out," said Richard Cammarieri, the board member who
introduced both measures.

Mr. Cammarieri, a friend of Mr. Baraka, said he did not consider the poem, "Somebody Blew Up America," anti-Semitic, noting that it
addresses the oppression of both blacks and Jews and poses a provocative a question that is directed at Israel, not Jews:

Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed

Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers

To stay home that day

Why did Sharon stay away?

Although that theory has been discredited, Mr. Baraka stands by the contention that Israelis were forewarned about the Sept. 11
attacks, saying there were only five Israelis among the nearly 3,000 victims.

"The idea might sound bizarre, but to say I'm an anti-Semite is not based on reality," Mr. Baraka said today. "If they want to find
anti-Semites, read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, poets that are loved and praised."

As in the past, he challenged his critics to a line-by-line examination of the poem, which provoked widespread ire after it was read
at a poetry festival in September. Moved by the school board's proclamation but resigned to the fate that awaits him in Trenton, Mr.
Baraka offered a wry assessment of his short, stormy tenure as New Jersey's poet laureate.

"At the very least," he said, "you can't say I'm not promoting poetry."

Hello everyone.  My new website is up, URL WilliamJamesAustin.com.  All seems
to be functioning well, except for Igor's and my collaboration which still
resists the light of day.  Working out the bugs on that one, but it can be
seen on mIEKAL aND's Spidertangle site.

Check out the "blackbox" gallery for work by Igor Satanovsky, Mike
Magazinnik, Jesse Glass, Geoffrey Gatza, and Lanny Quarles.  The gallery will
function as a rotating exhibit.  In a few months I'll post a submissions
announcement.  I hope to get all you good folks into the gallery sooner or
later.  My college website is still available by link.  Best, Bill

Subject:      something happens in the head
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Andrew,

Are you really claiming, as your post seems to imply, that Pound was a
better writer than S. Howe?  If so, on what basis-- other than your apparent
dislike of the postmodern project?

"Something good takes place in the head when subject and verb are joined."
And I can tell you exactly what that is: recognition of the familiar.  [Read
entire post before hitting Reply.]

One thing I think Pound & Howe have in common with other "good" poets
(Dickinson, Niedecker, Shakespeare, Ashbery, Spicer come to mind, for
starters) is an impatience with that recognition-- an almost violent will to
push poetry toward the unfamiliar.  Note that the unfamiliar is not
necessarily the most disjunct or opaque construct imaginable, though at
times it might be, as for example in the late 1970s.

Is the crux of your argument that complete fragmentation is no longer
sufficiently unfamiliar?  If so I don't disagree.  However, I sense a binary
in your thinking: complete sentence "vs." fragmentation.  Why not use both
in the same poem?  What about the way poets like Stein, Raworth, Coolidge
(in some works) & Heliczer have managed to avoid either/or, by creating
poems which are neither sentences nor accretions of fragments but which
employ a fluidly expansive syntax:

bird burgeoning sky frozen turmoil in the spawning grounds
curved over the dusty line no impressionistic of pretty girls at street
corners

my fathers body lies in this lava hill

where beggars and sea urchins are lapped by the lavender
tongues of dog angels side walk painting of pastel chapels begs
coin of the finest mint enamelled with verdigris my fathers body lies

naked in his icon of blue jeans run
soft white feel flower in the bones center
the bone truly running up your back

--opening of Heliczer's "bird burgeoning sky," p. 84 in the recent Granary
Books collection.  [& Note that his long lines will probably not translate
well into an e-mail message].

Okay, that's maybe even too "syntactical" an example-- but you get what I
mean.

Would Pound have allowed for your "something good happens in the head"?
Shouldn't we demand, even of our casual exchanges, a more rigorous thinking
about poetry?

I have nothing against complete sentences.  I only insist that they be
completely beautiful.

Subject: FACTORY SCHOOL digital audio archive


Having filled the 1 gigabyte of storage allotted for the Factory
School digital audio archive, it's time to think about what to remove
as I'd like to cycle new audio files in over next few weeks.
Eventually, all of the files will be available somewhere, but for now
I need some feedback as to what to keep on-line and what to move
temporarily off-line until arrangements can be made.

Since I know that folks from more than twenty countries regularly
visit the archive, I'm worried about disruptions in service. While
site reports allow me to know which are the most popular files (top
30 by month), please let me know (back-channel, thanks) which files
you currently use or need for teaching purposes. I know from these
reports which files get used the most, so another way to 'vote' would
be to click on your favorite poet reading her/his work. But I am
concerned about files that may not appear on the popularity radar.

Thanks for your help.  http://www.factoryschool.org

Also, would Eric Baus, Jeff Davis, Mike Boughn and Laura Wright
please drop me a note privately? These folks, and anyone else who
makes a donation of tapes, will receive the entire archive on 2
disks-- about 600 files.

Forgive me for cross-posting.  & please spread the word....

To me much of it seems to be relatively old news (specifically, the list of
US corporate weapons suppliers to Saddam particularly between 1984-1988 has
been available for years via other sources, including a former US Army
General) but I guess now that Iraq's list matches what's been in circulation
for a while.  Which perhaps lessens the credibility of the list.

What's being left out is *who* brokered the deals between US Corporations
and the Iraqi government.  We all know a company who sells somethings wants
to sell it.  No big surprise there.  But who lets it or makes it happen?
Hint: the first four letters of one of the brokers' names is: B-U-S-H

Hi,

Two messages today...a head's up on what will be a huge story
(interfering with U.S. war plans) around the world, that MAY even break
into serious visibility in the U.S., and another in our series of book
interviews that we are periodically sending, to let you know about
excellent new titles (this one by Milan Rai called War Plan Iraq).


First, when the massive pile of documents from Iraq appeared, in photos,
in the paper, and the U.S. immediately pulled out all stops to get first
access, to shut down wide dissemination, etc. -- the smart money said
that buried in the morass there would be evidence of U.S. (and European)
culpability in aiding the Iraqi weapons programs, dating back to before
the Gulf War, but covering the period of Hussein's rise and his worst
crimes, etc.

And lo and below...to be reported in tomorow's Die Tageszeitung (Berlin
daily), here is a list of US corporations that alegedly supplied Iraq
with nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile technology, prior to
1991. The list comes, it seems, from the original Iraqi report to the
Security Council. This is a big breaking story in Europe - read the clip
from this morning's Independent (London) below the list.

---

U.S. corporations involved...

A - nuclear     K - chemical     B - biological      R - rockets
(missiles)

 1) Honeywell (R,K)
 2) Spektra Physics (K)
 3) Semetex (R)
 4) TI Coating (A,K)
 5) UNISYS (A,K)

 21) Bechtel (K)
 22) EZ Logic Data Systems,Inc. (R)
 23) Canberra Industries Inc. (A)
 24) Axel Electronics Inc. (A)

Additionally to these 24 companies based in the US, are nearly 50
subsidiaries of foreign enterprises whose arms co-operation with Iraq
seems to have been operated  from the US.  In addition, Ministries for
defense, energy, trade, and agriculture, as well as the foremost U.S.
nuclear weapons laboratories at Lawrence Livermore. Los Alamos, and
Sandia, are designated as suppliers for the Iraqi arms programs for A,
B, and C-weapons as well as for rockets.

Here is the report from this morning's Independent, in London...

Leaked Report Says German and US Firms Supplied Arms to Saddam
By Tony Paterson
The Independent (UK)

Baghdad's uncensored report to UN names Western companies alleged to
have developed its weapons of mass destruction.

Wednesday, 18 December, 2002

Iraq's 11,000-page report to the UN Security Council lists 150 foreign
companies, including some from America, Britain, Germany and France,
that supported Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programme, a
German newspaper said yesterday.

Berlin's left-wing Die Tageszeitung newspaper said it had seen a copy of
the original Iraqi dossier which was vetted for sensitive information by
US officials before being handed to the five permanent Security Council
members two weeks ago. An edited version was passed to the remaining 10
members of the Security Council last night.

British officials said the list of companies appeared to be accurate.
Eighty German firms and 24 US companies are reported to have supplied
Iraq with equipment and know-how for its weapons programmes from 1975
onwards and in some cases support for Baghdad's conventional arms
programme had continued until last year.

It is not known who leaked the report, but it could have come from Iraq.
Baghdad is keen to embarrass the US and its allies by showing the close
involvement of US, German, British and French firms in helping Iraq
develop its weapons of mass destruction when the country was a bulwark
against the much feared spread of Iranian revolutionary fervour to the
Arab world.

The list contained the names of long-established German firms such as
Siemens as well as US multi-nationals. With government approval, Siemens
exported machines used to eliminate kidney stones which have a "dual
use" high precision switch used to detonate nuclear bombs. Ten French
companies were also named along with a number of Swiss and Chinese
firms. The newspaper said a number of British companies were cited, but
did not name them.

"From about 1975 onwards, these companies are shown to have supplied
entire complexes, building elements, basic materials and technical
know-how for Saddam Hussein's programme to develop nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction," the newspaper said. "They also
supplied rockets and complete conventional weapons systems," it added.

The five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States,
Britain, Russia, France and China -- have repeatedly opposed revealing
the extent of foreign companies' involvement, although a mass of
relevant information was collected by UN weapons inspectors who visited
the country between 1991 and 1998. The UN claims that publishing the
extent of the companies' involvement in Iraq would jeopardise necessary
co-operation with such firms.

German involvement outstripped that of all the other countries put
together, the paper said. During the period to 1991, the German
authoritiespermitted weapons co-operation with Iraq and in some cases
"actively encouraged" it, according to the newspaper which cited German
assistance allegedly given to Iraq for the development of poison gas
used in the 1988 massacre of Kurds in northern Iraq. It said that after
the massacre America reduced its military co-operation with Iraq but
German firms continued their activities until the Gulf War.

Die Tageszeitung quoted sources close to the US Vice President, Dick
Cheney, as saying the Bush administration was hoping to prove a German
company was continuing to co-operate with the Iraqi regime over the
supply of equipment allegedly useful in the construction of weapons of
mass destruction.

American weapons experts have recently voiced concern that the German
Government has permitted Siemens to sell Baghdad at least eight
sophisticated medical machines which contain devices that are vital for
nuclear weapons. The machines, known as "lithotripters", use ultrasound
to destroy kidney stones in patients. However, each machine contains an
electronic switch that can be used as a detonator in an atomic bomb,
according to US experts. Iraq was reported to have requested an extra
120 switches as "spare parts" during the initial transaction.

The delivery of the machines was approved by the European Commission and
the UN because sanctions against Iraq do not apply to medical equipment.
Siemens and the German Government have insisted that the machines, which
are being used in northern Iraq under a World Health Organisation
programme, cannot be used to make nuclear weapons.

Also, here is a brief interview for your pleasure/edification with Milan
Rai, in ZNet's usual manner, regarding his new book, published by
Verso...

Interviewing Milan Rai
War Plan Iraq
http://versobooks.com/books/nopqrs/r-titles/rai_m_iraq.shtml

1) Can you tell ZNet, please, what your new book is about? What is it
trying to communicate?

War Plan Iraq tries to explain and document how the US has been hostile
to both UN weapons inspectors and to real regime change in Iraq. It also
sets out reasons why a war on Iraq would be immoral and illegal,
including the likely catastrophic effects on the civilian population.
The book is intended to give anti-war activists the ammunition they need
to win the argument and persuade the uncommitted.

Recent history demonstrates that the US has tried to achieve 'regime
stabilisation and only leadership change' in Iraq (by denying support to
the uprisings in 1991, for example), and has prioritised these goals
over the disarmament/inspection process in Iraq (by collapsing the UN
weapons inspection process in December 1998, for example).

The idea of the book was that it should be possible to give it to
someone who is solidly pro-war and for them not to be able to
immediately reject it, but be forced to engage with the depth of
documentation and the sober presentation.

Very important to the book are anti-war observations by relatives of
September 11th victims <www.peacefultomorrows.org, and images and
photographs of young Iraqis by artist Emily Johns and professional
photographer Kim Weston-Arnold, as well as an important chapter
addressing 9/11 by Noam Chomsky.

(2) Can you tell ZNet something about writing the book? Where does the
content come from? What went into making the book what it is?

The bulk of the book draws on four years of full-time
anti-sanctions/anti-war campaigning as joint coordinator of Voices in
the Wilderness UK, and fourteen years of writing and activism on these
topics with ARROW (Active Resistance to the Roots of War). Quite a bit
of the content comes from reading the British newspapers closely over
the course of the last year. The idea of the images and photographs is
to humanise the Iraqi people, who I have met, and found enormously
hospitable on my four sanctions-breaking delegations to Iraq over the
past four years.

(3) What are your hopes for War Plan Iraq? What do you hope it will
contribute or achieve, politically? Given the effort and aspirations you
have for the book, what will you deem to be a success? What would leave
you happy about the whole undertaking? What would leave you wondering if
it was worth all the time and effort?

What do I hope for War Plan Iraq? I hope that it will be a useful tool
for the international anti-war movement (it is being translated into
Arabic, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Norwegian, Brazilian Portuguese,
Japanese, and Korean) and that it will help to swing/shore up domestic
opinion in the US and the UK against war.

I hope that it will encourage and empower anti-war activists and
persuade the uncommitted to raise their voices against war.

I already feel that the book was worth all the effort, because it has
already helped a lot of people to resist propaganda and to win arguments
and to deepen their understanding of the depths of cynicism and
brutality with which we are faced.

I can't say that I am happy with the book and its effects, because I
wish that there was some way that cultural efforts (books) and political
efforts (organising civil disobedience and so on) could be sure of
preventing mass destruction in Iraq. I'm glad people have found the book
useful, including people like George Monbiot and Tariq Ali and Martin
Thomas (our version of Michael Moore) and left-wing Labour MPs.

In some tiny way the book is increasing the chances of survival of
children in Iraq, that is its purpose and I have to be content with
that.

Hi Bill,



I wanted to comment on your website. I am glad its up and you have done a
wonderful job. I love the picture, you always come off scary on film :-) And
before I begin, thanks for a place in your gallery. I am honored.



I have been dwelling on post avant writings lately and your idea of
visionism hits the mark for me today. Its comforting that it is not set in a
manifesto or something to subscribe to but offering a continuity between
ancient myth through the avant and passing LANGUAGE. The use of obfuscated
emotion is wonderful. Its odd to see your work lined down the page but I am
guessing this is from the HTML. It opens the playing field in Symphony
though. The four parts contrasting inwardly on related movements makes for a
full poem. The sound and echo displayed in divided sentences gives a tense
impression of Silliman but it goes beyond doesn't it. As new sentence
applying for an AARP card, wink. (I'll probably be in trouble on the blog,
[Ron, that's Gatza with an O]).



I am just coming off of a cold and 'vaporized'  made me laugh. The blending
of JC over that hairstyle in a wheelchair is provocative, a finding of Peace
in black and white. Your other new media poems are fun too. The atomic blast
seems unusually timely again. I haven't thought about death from above in
since the 80's. The more things change .



All in all it's a wonderful site and wish you all the success in the world
:-)



Best, Geoffrey

hopefully nada you'll "announce" interesting your new additions to the
list.  I can't bring myself to check blogs religiously or make them
part of my daily internet ritual but if something catches my eye I'll
check it out.  ron's lists even got me to check out his posts a couple

you mention urban wildlife, the permaculture of, I assume.  where does
wild poetry fit in that design?

  the look's not to be trusted -  it's better to twist then sneeze

ends disappeared with the best of them,  becoming sulfur and mercury
that becomes fingers on the hand.  the typical what for's  become
further conveniences' to become every whether tods bravely tethered to
pluses and minuses, carrying on about zed and naught parenthesis filled
with burgeoning slightness of edge, beckoning with broadcast hand-jobs
and perma-press 60 watt fantasies.  a collateral was set up at 5.5%,
accruing interest on a bimonthly rotation, allowing each the option of
the position and a personal motto.  all this, while from a location
still is yet to be determined through a filter of whispers came: "
someone is in pain,  someone is in pain . . ."  it didn't stop for
days; " someone is in pain . . ."
         at the same time or one of those moments later that seems like the
same time  the young and nubile stated to appear everywhere in groups
of three or not singing: "someone is in pain and we are here to help."
reaching out with their pincher type appendages.  all fades to black.
at that same moment; the symbol of an eagle,  a cross, a star, a
pyramid,  one eye,  and a cross-stitched adage of; " there's no place
like home" - appears, then there is a clicking sound or guns or heels,
and again - " there's no place like home."

question...

how many folks on this list would be interested in a site for poetry blogs?
i'd be willing to set up a space similar to the blogspot site for poetry
folks if there was enough interest.

not sure how it would exactly work, but i'd give it some thought depending
on the feedback. i'm sure i could set up the option for a wider choice of
templates to choose from. there would be no banner ads (& thus no
possibility for nasty spyware cookies anywhere), but there might be, say, a
$10 / year charge to cover the server space. still have to think it all
through though.

The poet Sean Cole produced a terrific radio piece featuring me that will
air on WHYY in Philadelphia Friday at 11 AM.  The recent Ruth Lilly gift to
POETRY Chicago got Sean thinking: what happens when you take poets out of
their normal lives of poverty and obscurity and insert them onto the lap of
luxury?  A limo ride and a trip to the posh Presidential suite of the
Charles Hotel proves to have quite an impact on my poetry.  With a cameo by
Alice Quinn of the NEW YORKER!  Please listen, you Brotherly lovers!

Ah ... you begin by quoting me!  No greater honor, Geoff.  Thanks so much for
that, and for your contributions to, and commentary on, the site.  I'm new at
this, and certainly not in your website league, so I'm sure to fuck up often.
 Hope everyone will be patient while I feel my way.  By the way, you're
right.  Visionism is not a movement or school or fedora or wildebeest.  It's
not new and it's never old.

By the way, I have no gripe with Ron.  I don't think he meant to hurt
anyone's feelings.  I think his intent was to protect, not to attack.  His
heart is in the right place, just a tad overactive at times.  I respect him.
Hell, I respect everyone on this list.  I want my work to stir up some
controversy.  Geoff, you seem bent the same way and I love you for it.  After
all, we're not doing anything the langpoets didn't try to do back in the day.
 Best to you and Donna, Bill

Andrew:

Since my one-line reply (lit theory as haiku) I've been troubling over the
above. Etymology is I think a limited, if occasionally useful, signpost on
the road to wisdom. What accrues over centuries is more often than not the
accident of transmission, especially when the transmission is across
languages. Incomplete sentence=they left the cell door open?

No matter--in this case the source is not a noun, but a verb, sentire, to
be sensorily aware, to sense.. Hence, sense, meaning feel, also scent,as
well as the other senses--all sensations.

So if I say "smell of piss" I've expressed a sense, maybe by inference a
sentiment. Sentience. Sentence as sentimentality?

The dog's awareness is actually pretty interesting. It parses that smell,
which is why it takes so long at the sniffing and finds it so exciting. The
dog's poem, if the owner could read it, might well be a list of nouns
punctuated by an occasional question. A four dimensional reflexive field,
its entire vocabulary a list of what's been left there and who left it. One
way to costitute a moment's world.

I remember when cable TV first arrived on the scene. There were so many
hilarious rough hewn, do-it-yourself shows, particularly on public access
channels. I particularly liked twisted parodies of talk shows. One really
weird one, I don't remember the name, I'm told ended up being shown as a
rerun on MTV. I'm sure plenty of this still goes on, but with the current
explosion of channels and cable networks, how would you find them or hear
about the interesting ones? In the early days of the poetics list, there
were few other poetry discussion groups- that I knew about, anyway-
focusing on innovative writing. Then came the subpoetics list-I've heard
it's very interesting- as are many others, no doubt. Then webmagazines like
potepoetzine, Alterran Assemblage, Alienated.net and Laurable appeared-and
others like Ethan Paquin's Slope, August Highland's m.a.g. and Chris Tysh's
mark(s). I've been checking Alienated.net fairly regularly as it has some
interesting poetry announcements, reviews and lists many other worthwhile
sites. When the first blogs arrived on the scene, I realized another step in
this accelerating  evolution was taking place like the much earlier TV
evolution from cable or that from the 60s and 70s explosion of inexpensive
mimeo and xeroxed magazines. Why publish in- or publish, for that matter- a
mimeo or xeroxed magazine when you can be published in or publish a gorgeous
perfect bound mag or book? Why write frequently on the poetics list when you
can have your own blog? You can have all the space you want, and if someone
is not interested they don't have to read it, right? If they like what they
are reading, they can read some or all of the earlier entries. I've read,
for example, Ron Silliman and Jordan Davis' blogs and they are both
worthwhile and interesting.  I guess it's like sponsoring or being sponsored
on your own regular TV show instead of being an occasional or regular guest
on a program. Then, after awhile, why just have your own show when you can
have your own network? Then you can sponsor many shows, and so on. Having
closely watched the fate of cable, I expected this, but I'm  feeling a
little wistful seeing that old gang of mine from the poetics list go on to
fame and fortune on their own soon to be award winning websites and other
terrific spinoffs. I hope they will keep on posting on and visiting the
poetics list frequently anyway, perhaps posting some of their favorite blog
entries on the list- or with permission, of course, those of others. In any
case, before long, we'll be seeing web program guides, the -Webcademy
Awards- or the -E-mies- the Best of the Blogs- and online anthologies. So
far, most prolific listees like Ron keep us up to date regularly about their
writing on other sites -along with their readings and publications. I'm
certainly looking forward to Nada Gordon's and Bill Austin's sites. I'm sure
I'll keep up to date, I usually try, but I am already imagining becoming
nostalgic and going back and reading some of those great early editions of
the poetics list when I wasn't reading it so closely- and rereading Joel
Kuzai's terrific poetics@-Roof-1999. You can always console yourself with
reruns!

A Manual for Intellectual Survival



« For a totalitarian regime, wrote Arendt,
the ideal citizen isn’t a chest-thumping Nazi, but rather the man for whom
the distinction between fact and fiction (meaning the reality of the
experience)
and the distinction between true and false
(meaning the standard way of thinking)
doesn’t exist any more.»

To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the International Parliament of
Writers, www.autodafe.org is starting the publication of a series of
articles
in order to attempt to provide an overview of the new dangers weighing on
literature and thought, the unprecedented forms that censure and propaganda
are wearing today, as well as the new means and networks of intellectual,
literary and linguistic resistance.

As usual I am probably in the minority here, but after so much has been
written about the "death of the author" by experimentalists of every stripe,
hasn't the invention of the blog merely resuscitated him in the most
reactionary way possible, namely, in the form of the personal journal where
the "I" is foregrounded in nearly every word? It makes me think that what is
being called "new media art" is merely an attempt at backtracking modernity
to the bad old ways under the slick guise of a new media facade. Another
example of this is the grossly overused word (and one I happen to hate)
"immersive" that gets tossed about mainly in relation to virtual reality. I
think Brecht and Shlovsky would have had fits over that. O where are the
forward-thinking new ideas that would make this brave new media truly the
innovation it deserves to be, instead of a safe haven for closetted
traditionalists?

Already there are stylistic conventions codifying around blog-use. Most
blogs are evidentiary (based on some measure of topicality) or the
relevatory (x, y, and z happened to me today). But there's no reason these
conventions can't be turned into palimpsests or fissures themselves.

There are also sometimes underutilized collaborative tools with blogging
--although some of the Live Journal sites have the right idea. Good
discussions and the like can come out of weblogging -- it's a matter of
establishing the "right" software (commenting systems, rings, etc.) to
afford those types of opportunities.

One of my favorites to read is The Dinghy, http://thedinghy.blogspot.com.
Performing strangeness, there.

What blogs do best is provide a streamlined typography for thought. Almost
like a Carolingian reassessment of the homepage (probably an imperfect
analogy, but...)

Best,
Alan

BUT----the death of the author was never murder.  The point was always a new
comprehension of authorial source.  We now understand, I think, that the
author is both a product and producer of language, despite the illusion
language provides that an author is somehow and somewhere other.  Analysis
need not change anything on the page.  Best, Bill

Folks-

I'm helping put together an anthology of South Asian,
Middle Eastern and East Asian contemporary poetry, in
original English and in translation. I'm responsible
for the South Asian portion of this anthology and
wonder if you could help spread the word about the
project to any writers who might fit the bill (be they
inhabitants or descendants of South Asia, poets in
their own right or translators). Interested writers
can email a group of up to five poems by 1/15/2003 to:

shankarr@ccsu.edu

Please include a bio and contact information.

Regards,

Ravi Shankar

not sure about this, though it's a provocative point of view (as
always). for me (yes, me me me, it's all about me), the blog's
contingent and unfinished nature can point in 2 directions; one is
the "rushing stuff into premature 'publication' before it's been
carefully thought thru or worked into a coherent 'argument,'" in
which case there's a kind of author-fetishizing frenzy going on
(getting your ideas out as *yours*); the other trajectory is the more
democratic one, where the proliferation of musings at all levels of
sophistication or (in)completion has the power to create a thicket of
discourse that can be revolutionary.  i'm thinking of the corollary
move in academic writing to permit more of the "personal voice"
--that is, it can be seen as reactionary in that it ratifies the
subject position of the author, but it had its genesis in movements
like feminism and minoritarian writing that purposefully set out to
undermine the "objectivity" of the authoritative, disembodied
expert-writer.

Is poetry publishing ridden with (reverse?) ageism?

It seems very similar to corporate America in this regard: with a few rare
exceptions, you don't exist as a poet-author until you're 35 or 40, and then
once you "break through," you're swimming in the publication river until
you're at least 60.

Some say it's experience but couldn't this be merely an apologetic for
ageism?

Either there are

a.  ZERO good poets under 25, few good poets under 30, a handful under 35,
but oodles and oodles of good poets between 40 and 60
or
b.  what is good is decided at least in part on the basis of age and/or
things related to age (such as professorships, "long-standing
relationships", the appearance of "life experience" which is just a
euphemism for poetic solipsism/expressionism, the glacial pace of
conservative perceptions, etc.)

One journal originally came out to address this issue (Combo) and it seems
to have tried its best to stick to this original calling to publish poets in
their twenties and early thirties.

Discuss?

(How reflexively aware is the poetry community?)

I'm glad Nick weighed in about the blogicization, and
it's helpful that he used that self/affect slant that
he's good at and that's an ideological/poetics
position of his, as I'm not as good at it---  Last
night, when I looked at Nada's one-entry blog,
strangely, I felt similar emotional regret, nostalgia,
disconsolate, etc.,--- not because she was writing
poorly or anything like that--- but, a little bit of a
feeling of "Another one bites the dust", another
Stepford blogger.  Pod people become blog people.
It's also striking to me that it's, so far, mainly
East Coast and New York City poets who are blogging
themselves away.  Is this ~not~ a post-9/11 effect?
The saddened feeling that I felt was that it somehow
increases our solitude.

I lean toward M. Palmer's (first name?) response: he
said "reactionary" and, last night, I thought
"counter-revolutionary"; it seemed to me like people
were sneaking back in through the "back door" what
they'd just thrown out the front; etc.  Nick gets to
the point: "Why write frequently on the poetics list
when you can have your own blog?"   My version of that
was: why would people ever ~want~ to blog? what could
possibly motivate this wave?  Jonathan Mayhew's blog
is candid: he unsubscribed in reaction to Richard
Tylor's anti-Americanism (Mayhew calls him "some poet
in New Zealand").  A blog (1) takes conflict-aversion
to the next level of removing oneself from the
possibly risky environment that many have objected to
in the List's social unpredictability (there's a
photograph in my family's album of my sister as a
child, in a party dress, sitting on the carpeted floor
in her bedroom by herself, caught by surprise, playing
with all the toys and birthday things she was just
given at a birthday party ~in progress~ at that same
moment with friends all outside the bedroom whom she'd
left behind: blogs remind me of that protective
self-insulation)--- you can hold forth without
interruption, rebuttal, or disagreement; (2) a blog
allows you to be found by a Google search, whereas the
Poetics List does not: moreso, by writing about poets
and keywords that others would be searching for,
people can be lead to discovering you by Googling
after those other names; (3) importantly, a blog, with
its representational self-depiciton, by returning to
all the Foucauldian "Techniques of Self" mechanisms,
allows ~self-invention~ --- one is not merely a
practicing poet but someone consummately preoccupied
with poetry in every waking moment and every thought,
the poet who is more than a poet (read: bad faith)
(I'm often taken aback at how bloggers ~stick to the
subject~ so.  Like, ~don't these people ever go to the
opera~ [Ron's blog has already stated his antipathy
and condemnation of that] or anything??  Isn't there
another ~channel~ that they switch over into?  Why is
their self-portrayal so lacking in normal
multifariousness, O'Hara's "grace to live as variously
as possible"?  It seems like it would be healthier,
given this day-by-day/hour-by-hour reality TV look
into their solitude, for them to just ~forget about~
being a poet some of the time and change the tune
every now and then.  I'm amazed at how obsessively
they stay on target); . . .

These blogs, so far, are by no means the ~Goncourt
brothers'~ journals.  Regardless of how the bloggers
might actually live, these self-portrayals are
typically catching them at their most a-social,
connecting only through the mediation of what
literature they have opinions about.

I find that this "self redux" or "pre-self" that's
emerging in their self-portraits is curiously lacking
in ~sympathy~ to themselves, too.  It's lacking in
ideology and it's somehow short on compassion for the
very pathos that they're revealing about themselves.
---  Granted, there was remission from psychosis
involved, but if you think of the self-writing in
~Morning of the Poem,~ when James Schuyler returned to
mimetic self-depiction after years of writing in
less-/other-signifying modes, the ~weakness~ and
frailty of self that he had the courage to show: I'll
never forget that puffy plastic WonderBread bag he
went out to buy for his sandwiches.   But how it would
tarnish their authority, to make a sandwich (white
bread).  To return to diary as a literary form is one
thing, but to then behave as those these "discourses"
and rhetoric were completely natural, in no way to
~wink,~ and to conduct re-construction of self with
the same, unconscious prerogatives as the New
Formalists . . . !

Of course, there always had to remain a dialectic
between Language writing (with its various
~semblables~) and the ongoing momentum of
institutionalized normative autobiography, ---if the
latter were to disappear, a world overrun with nothing
but Language would be bedlam,--- but the blogs, like
some of the print essays and interviews that were
creeping up to this, seem blithely oblivious to that
original ~agonistic~ struggle that these poets' poetry
is based on,--- so that ~they themselves~ are
simultaneously re-enforcing the very dominances that
their poetry is challenging, as if undoing with one
hand what you'd just done with the other, language a
row of buttons (clothes buttons) that you take off
only in order to put it back on again, language the
zipper.

The positive side is that the pendulum must have swung
too far, that it's a free market after all and not
capitalism, and that those weren't ~crashes,~ they
were "market corrections."   I'm trying to see it
along the lines that Pierre Joris suggested, a helpful
reminder that it's all (maybe) rhizomatic, and not
~defection from a utopian collectivity and the hope of
symposium.~

---  I admit to generally skipping over Richard's
posts.  But I read one the other day (considering what
slim pickin's there are, these days), his
uncontrollable enthusiasm and curiosity thinking that
dcmb had actually spent an evening with the grand J.
Ashbery himself, just as Richard's earlier post had
fantasized to do.  But when Richard, parenthetically,
wound up including this little, peripheral detail
about having ~lived at home with his mother all his
life~ until she died when he was 53, and how he
wouldn't listen to ~"dissonant"~ music as much as he
might've liked to because the sound of it might've
bothered her in the next room---  ---*that's
excruciating!*  The sympathy just ripped through me.
~This~ is what brought down the project of a poetics
community and drove professors of literature into
hermetically sealed sound-proof booths?!  This is
getting like Sullivan in the computerized cartoon
~Monster, Inc.~ where the monsters try to be so scary
but they're terrified of a little child.   Meanwhile,
the bloggers' armor.  . . . Will they ever get there?
Could they?  Or: the self imago in Heather Ramsdell's
~Lost Wax~ who is always rummaging through closets and
drawers for a pair of missing socks.  But the bloggers
don't seem to know where Beckett took things.  The
narcissistic incapacity of the individual to admit to
any vulnerability or weakness completely parallels the
current national defense.  (Whatever his prose's other
flaws, it should be said in favor of Richard's posts
that he's never erected a reified concrete self as
totem in his writings.)  ---  But maybe it's positive:
maybe these blogged missteps are ~paving the way,~ a
gradual loosening of poetry's puritanical rejection of
some badly needed ballast of self.   I guess I had
expected it to be more conjectural and avant-garde,
though.  Who ~told~ them they are these characters?
The use of "personal criticism" by feminists or queer
theorists, which Maria rightly mentions,--- wasn't it
always an attempt, though, to maintain at all points
the ~partial,~ perspectival, therefore qualified and
limited nature of all writing, to localize each
thought, in refutation of the depersonalized and
therefore more effectively dominant (male) voice of
criticism (that I often slip into)?   It's the
difference between fetish and, say, surveyor's tripod,
the latter being all about a measurement of ~distance~
between objects.  My myopia, my color blindness.  The
"personal criticism" that sticks in my mind, for
example, was queer theorist D.A. Miller putting
himself completely on the line in ~The Novel and The
Police~ by describing an appointment with a
psychiatrist who diagnosed him as Borderline,---
(then, ~what's the rest of the book!?~
Auto-symptomatology?) or his ambiguous, seemingly
gratuitous self-portraiture in the Barthes book as on
his back doing bench press in the gym (man of steel,
or vain conformist? half-naked and at risk of the
barbell he was holding falling down to crush him if
his partner slipped).  (I don't recall if it was word
of mouth or in his writing, but I also remember his
"personal criticism" including his fear of becoming
the man with the poodle and beret, that somehow
stereotypes are true.)

Yes, Richard, yes.  He had a small rose watercolor by
Pierre-Joseph Redouté on his wall.

Jeffrey - I just read your post on blogs quickly - but thank you. I share a
sympathy with much of your thinking here. "Blogs" do strike me as
old-fashioned castles (aloof from the bog, draw bridge access). No
challenge, no outside editorial/critical function (unless pre-selected
quotes permitted into the space. Ron S tries, but he is still his own
arbiter).   I think blogs are good for certain things that I won't go into
here.  But I think a listserv - until it exhausts itself or self-destructs -
is similar to the old fashioned "Commons" - the place where community(ies)
can be argued out and celebrated - a place of contingency ("as variously as
possible" or called for). A place of risk, ideally a safe one (i.e. sans gov
surveillance, coming in the next edition!!??)

Thanks again,
Stephen Vincent

Oh jeez, Michael, Maria, Jeffrey, Nick, all,

I spent all day working on my blog entry and now I have to respond to
this little controversy, eek, well, OK, a few points in response to
the following:

from M. Palmer:
>As usual I am probably in the minority here, but after so much has been
>written about the "death of the author" by experimentalists of every stripe,
>hasn't the invention of the blog merely resuscitated him in the most
>reactionary way possible, namely, in the form of the personal journal where
>the "I" is foregrounded in nearly every word? It makes me think that what is
>being called "new media art" is merely an attempt at backtracking modernity
>to the bad old ways under the slick guise of a new media facade. Another
>example of this is the grossly overused word (and one I happen to hate)
>"immersive" that gets tossed about mainly in relation to virtual reality. I
>think Brecht and Shlovsky would have had fits over that. O where are the
>forward-thinking new ideas that would make this brave new media truly the
>innovation it deserves to be, instead of a safe haven for closetted
>traditionalists?


1) Just because zebra experimentalists have written about SQUARE
QUOTES the death of the author SCARE QUOTES doesn't mean that I
accept it as doctrine or find it helpful to my writing.  Rather, my
writing feels more like the testimony of the expressive subject's
desire -- and struggle, given all sorts of antagonisms-- to thrive.
My attitude might be summed up as "I'M DOING IT BECAUSE I WANT TO AND
NOT BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO." I would like you to take notice of the
pronoun that follows "resuscitated" in the quote above.  That pronoun
is precisely one of the reasons that I was moved to blog. There is no
reason why my "gurlesque" (thanks, Arielle) perceptions and opinions
can't occupy as much cyberspace as the patriarchs'.

I haven't heard the term "immersive" bandied about, because I don't
read any pomo net theory, but I don't have any trouble with the term
per se.  Virtual media *is* absorbing and oceanic.  I know because I
fell in love in it. Am I supposed to keep myself from swimming in
electronic amniotic fluid because I'm afraid of what Brecht (whose
poetics I admire but am in practice quite opposite from) or Shklovsky
(that's with a "k", darling.  did you notice that he blurbed my new
book?) might think?

What is it you want from writers? Everyone in grey headscarves? If I
dont wear a grey headscarf does that make me a reactionary?


from M. Damon
>
>not sure about this, though it's a provocative point of view (as

>contingent and unfinished nature can point in 2 directions; one is

>expert-writer.

Maria, I'm sure I want to go in both of the directions you mentioned
above. "Sloppy in the most available way" they once called a review
of mine on the Brit-po list. I consider that an unintended
compliment. As far as "coherent arguments" go, I have REALLY MIXED
FEELINGS about *the logos*  -- which should emerge as not
uninteresting agonistics (you'll see, Jeffrey, I promise you I won't
get all over-explanatory) on the blog if I actually have the energy
to keep it up. And I pledge to do my utmost to undermine the
objectivity and authority of everything including myself.

I love the THICKET OF DISCOURSE image.  The author as BAMBI.

from J. Jullich
>My version of that
>was: why would people ever ~want~ to blog?


Your image of your sister at the birthday party was right on.  Look,
on my kindergarten report card I got an A (always) on all of my
developmental skills except "Plays well with others."  There I got an
S for sometimes. I really do like to play *in my own room*.  Also, I
would not expect a list as large or as contentious as this to indulge
the kinds of personal musings I extrude.  And I do feel that conflict
aversion is part of the attraction.  Posting on lists can lead to all
kinds of nasty responses -- sometimes even scary ones-- which I don't
particularly need in my life. If that's community then I don't want
it.  But I do love having guests over to my house. You know?

Jeffrey, I don't know how you can say I've "bitten the dust".  I
(almost) never post my opinions to this list.  To me, it doesn't feel
like the appropriate space to do that. There was, of course, a great
deal more to respond to in your post but I just can't do it now, my
arms hurt terribly. Now I'm off to go see a movie! (and you think
bloggers don't get around...)

Stay tuned to ULULATIONS! http://ululate.blogspot.com

love,
nada

I sure don't see the point of all this agonizing. The
blog-space no more reifies a reactionary subject
position than do any number of author-centric productions:
essays and other modalities of critical prose as well as,
less insistently but no less pervasively, any book of
poetry or journal publication with an author's name
attached to it.

Isn't Foucault's notion of the author function just a means
of embedding the effect in society and history, rather than
in an unknowable/fetishized interiority?

Barthes in "Death of the Author" writes,

"[W]riting is the destruction of every voice, of every
point of origin. Writing is that neutral, composite,
oblique space where our subject slips away, the negative
where all identity is lost, starting with the very identity
of the body writing."

He did not write, Therefore let us have no more authors. In
fact *Balzac* is his great example both here and in S/Z --
and he expressly says,

"As soon as a fact is narrated no longer with a view to
acting directly on reality but intransitively, that is to
say, finally outside of any function other than that of the
very practice of the symbol itself, this disconnection
occurs, the voice loses its origin, the author enters into
his own death, writing begins" --

Barthes (like Foucault) seems insistent that this is a
new perspective on extant practices, not a prolegomenon to
the overthrow of the subject. Of course one can write out
of an awareness of "the voice losing its origin," and many
great post-deconstruction works of poetry do exactly this
(Coolidge's Crystal Text being a perfect example that
springs to mind, among many others). But they do not
therefore posit a post-authorial universe. Neither do the
posts to this list, though they do constitute a wonderfully
adaptive social space. How is it that blogging gets singled
out for critique? Doesn't the phenomenon, inasmuch as it's
a subject/offshoot of the list, instead extend and enrich
what's happening here?

I for one am energized by projects like Patrick's Proximate
site that play in the space usually occupied by reflexive
expressionism. But Jeffrey, how is it that you want to see
poets letting their hair down (or putting it up) to go to
the opera, but not settling down into a casual
self-identical mode of commentary in the relatively
informal space of the blog, a mode (disregarding
subject matter) which is pretty indistinguishable from that
of most of us in our non-vatic everyday
self-representations, at the bank ("I would like to
withdraw money from my account, please, although admittedly
when I say 'I' what I refer to is always already only a
thread in the self-annihilating web of the langue"), on the
phone with mom, in a job interview, etc. etc.? I don't see
how this can't co-exist with other stances.

Best,
Damian

This will be of special interest to the post-projectivists amongst us,

Ron


Space in languages:
linguistic systems and cognitive categories

Paris, 7-8 February 2003 Ecole Normale Superieure (salle Dussane, to be
confirmed) 45 rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris

International conference organized by the research group Linguistic
diversity and change: cognitive implications with financial support from
the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique

Entrance is free, no registration

As illustrated by the Kantian tradition and by a number of cognitive
theories, space has been often viewed as a universal cognitive
primitive, an a priori form of intuition' that conditions all of our
experience.   From this point of view, it is of particular interest to
study the linguistic expression of space, since languages seem to
capture and to make explicit the constraints of experience on the
construction of spatial reference. At the same time, language confers to
spatial representations the property of referential 'detachability',
that distinguishes these representations   from those that are produced
by the perceptual experience of space. This fundamental property of
language allows speakers to dissociate and to choose among different
components of spatial reference, as well as to use spatial morphemes to
express other and/or more abstract meanings, such as temporal, causal or
argumentative relations.

A question then arises concerning the primitive and generative nature of
the category of space in languages. To what extent does space, as it is
linguistically encoded, reflect forms of perceptual experience and which
aspects of this experience do languages encode? Does space constitute a
pure and primitive category from which other linguistic meanings are
then derived? This question has been raised by cognitive grammars in
general and by metaphor theory in particular. It is also particularly
relevant in the light of numerous derivations that can be observed in
the history of languages, often indicating that a given term evolves
from a concrete spatial meaning to an abstract discourse one. What are
then the cognitive mechanisms that allow these transitions? Inversely,
some recent linguistic analyses argue that spatial values are neither
basic nor even purely spatial, but rather that spatial terms always
carry other values, for example related to the functional properties of
objects, their force or resistance, or the goals towards which speakers
construct spatial relations in their utterances. According to this
conception, space in language is therefore not a primitive category, but
already the result of some construction. What types of evidence can be
brought to bear on these different conceptions?

Furthermore, in the last twenty years, many studies in linguistics,
psycholinguistics, and cultural anthropology have revealed the existence
of rather varied spatial systems across languages and cultures. These
variations concern, for example, the nature of the linguistic devices
expressing spatial information (e.g. verbs, affixes, classifiers,
particles), the particular distinctions they encode, and the reference
systems that are used by speakers (absolute, egocentric, relative). In
addition, various studies show that linguistic and cultural systems
determine - at least partially - the nature and cognitive accessibility
of the information selected by speakers, thereby casting some doubts on
the supposedly universal properties of the category of space. This
evidence then raises questions concerning the impact of linguistic
categorization on perception, as well as the existence of a single
(a-modal) system or of two distinct (linguistic vs. perceptual and
motor) systems of spatial representations.

The study of space can then be reframed in terms of several fundamental
questions, that will be addressed during this conference from the point
of view of linguistics (typology, diachrony, sign-language), cognitive
anthropology, the philosophy of language, psycholinguistics, and
neurosciences.

To bloggies and antibloggies alike -

If you can only stand to read one more comment on the blog, read JJ's, not
mine, as it is much more thought-provoking than what I have to say. But if
you are a glutton for punishment, continue on. . .


I agree with WJA that the death of the author can be less like murder than
an Osiris-like scattering into many disparate pieces (Pessoa, etc.). There's
more than one way to kill an author, and I think we definitely should try
them all, especially now that we have a new medium, the Internet, that can
facilitate such a dispersal.

I am interested in seeing that art moves forward in its aims and not remain
static or go backwards. I will always find those artists who are pushing the
envelope more interesting than those who cavort in the footsteps of the
past. The "death of the author" is a fairly well accepted notion, but if one
wishes to critique it in favor of something that moves art to a new level, I
am open to suggestions.

Playing the gender card is bogus. There are plenty of radical women artists
who meet the "death of the author" criterion. In fact I think that women are
generally more radical than the men as far as today's poetry and art is
concerned. I therefore don't buy it when one leans on one's femininity as an
excuse to cling to outmoded notions. My use of the word "reactionary" was
perhaps a misstep, as it has unpleasant political connotations. (But then so
does "radical". . . Eh, it's hopeless!)

I find not a little uncondescending the suggestion that traditional methods
of artistic expression offer women and minorities an acceptable means to
compete with first world male-dominated discoveries. Especially since we now
have a large number of very fine women and minority artists in all fields
who show no desire to stay stuck in the past in the name of a rickety
feminist or multicultural ethics. (What is the state of radical feminism
today, anyway? I sense that it is fairly moribund.) Women artists have
quickly caught up and indeed are often surpassing the men in artistic
innovation, and that is to the benefit of all.

> the other trajectory [for a blog] is the more democratic one, where the
proliferation of musings at all levels of sophistication or (in)completion
has the power to create a thicket of discourse that can be revolutionary

Very interesting, but I don't see what would be revolutionary about it (nor
democratic). Journals have been around for centuries. (And constitute some
of my favorite reading. Thoreau, for instance.) Journal jottings "qua" art
might be worth exploring as an idea, as long as one evades the usual
autobiographical trappings. But no matter how many bells and whistles you
tack onto it, a blog is a blog is a blog, i.e., a form of writing grounded
in ego and reason and the urge towards polish and perfection (for even if
the prose is not polished, that is its dream). I oppose its continuance not
because I wish to impose a culture of gray headscarves upon the world but
just the opposite, because I value a culture that thinks and pushes ideas
forwards in a whole variety of colors and stripes.

Traditionalism is as much an "ism" as modernism, postmodernism etc. Favoring
one ideology over the other is not a way of imposing one's views on the
world but of making one's alliances known.

Minor aside: One can find plenty of places on the web where "Shlovsky" is
the accepted spelling. I know because I checked.


Okay I shot my wad for today. Are you happy now?

i like blogs.
i don't see their authors as being of the pre-barthesian single
authority/absolute truth variety.
the bloggers are saying 'here is what i think, here is what i have found,
read it if you wish'.
the writing, the content is more of-the-moment, you read it, you move on,
like so much of what we experience when surfing this medium.
BUT
i have little time to check all the blogs i would like to keep up to date
with, there are too many, and there will be more.
it is hard enough to keep up with the threads in ubpoetics and webartery, 2
lists i belong to.

does anyone know of a blog tracking/search engine which i can configure to
search nominated blogs regularly, look for key words i have nominated, and
report via email when a topic is updated?
(ie something akin to the nytimes tracking service)

But no matter how many bells and whistles you
tack onto it, a blog is a blog is a blog, i.e., a form of writing grounded
in ego and reason and the urge towards polish and perfection (for even if
the prose is not polished, that is its dream).

This list is a great place to get a headache and little else.  Why must Nada
defend her right to have a weblog?  No one here gave Ron Silliman a hard
time when his began.  Get back to your hibernating or wait for other juicy

Mark D,

You complicate my speculations, and I can't answer you, so I'll just describe my reaction to the Heliczer lines.  When I read the first of the strophes, I am a little bored.  You call the poet "fluidly expansive," but that is putting a nice spin on "formless and way too long."  Our brains will go to ridiculous lengths to make sense of what poets feed them.  But, for my brain at least, there has to be some kind of form, and at least the sentence is a form of thought, even if the thought is a flagrant idiocy.

So, what you deride as a recognition of the "familiar," I think of instead as the recognition that the poet is trying to satisfy the reader's possibly addict-like craving for intelligible form.  It may be a new form, or a broken form, but when the reader recognizes it then he/she begins to trust that, however confusing the writing, there will be a payoff at the end.  I don't really trust that Heliczer knows where he is going, based on what you quoted.  I sort of think to myself: shit, some of these images are OK, but it looks like I'm going to have to do _all_ the work explaining what this means.  We are good at that kind of speculative interpretation.  But some people enjoy it more than others.  Or perhaps I will enjoy this poet when I read more of him.

I think rigor, by the way, usually means something closer to the inflexibility of death (call it theory-death) when the talk is about art.  Are you eager to define all of your terms?  Even if you do, they will still be your terms, your abstractions.

A blog is not a literary style. A blog is a string of code. A technology.
Which doesn't mean that, similar to books or alphabets or other
technologies, a blog doesn't encourage, coax and invite certain types of
narratives to be created with it. Simply through the nature of its
interface. But there's no reason that these conventions can be thwarted, or
ignored altogether. And like I said in my last post, blogs are eminently
customizable, and have the potential for great fluidity. It need not be a
form that is isolatory, or rooted in theself. Although appearances of pure
sincerity can be deceptive. Teenagers, e.g., are much more astute readers
and writers with these things than we often give them credit for, and are
able to negotiate these nuances. No scientific data on that; just an
observation.

And someone said a little while back that somehow a listserv like this is
much more of a common space (a hasty paraphrase, my apologies). First of
all, it takes about 2 minutes of installing a code (even in Blogger) for a
detailed commenting system on any blog, so as to provide connective tissue
with any readership that might be out there. But also...what kind of
interface does this listserv provide to the larger world? Why is it
problematic that search engines can plumb blogs? Did I miss something, is
this an intranet or text-based closed circuit tv?(And if it is, should it
be this way?) "Common" spaces like this, much like some such areas in real
life, have their own patrollings as well. There is nothing to suggest that,
for some people, this listserv cannot be (sometimes deeply) intimidating,
or isolatory.

Best,
Alan

<< Is poetry publishing ridden with (reverse?) ageism?

It seems very similar to corporate America in this regard: with a few rare
exceptions, you don't exist as a poet-author until you're 35 or 40, and then
once you "break through," you're swimming in the publication river until
you're at least 60.

Some say it's experience but couldn't this be merely an apologetic for
ageism?

Either there are

a.  ZERO good poets under 25, few good poets under 30, a handful under 35,
but oodles and oodles of good poets between 40 and 60
or
b.  what is good is decided at least in part on the basis of age and/or
things related to age (such as professorships, "long-standing
relationships", the appearance of "life experience" which is just a
euphemism for poetic solipsism/expressionism, the glacial pace of
conservative perceptions, etc.)

One journal originally came out to address this issue (Combo) and it seems
to have tried its best to stick to this original calling to publish poets in
their twenties and early thirties.

Discuss?

(How reflexively aware is the poetry community?)

thinks she'll ever be good.  "Just tell me!" she screams.  "C'mon, I can take
it."  Nolte, the famous artist, replies, "You're twenty-two, so who knows?"

Andrew,

just to put my 2cents in on yr heliczer conversation for a moment:

you wrote:

I want to address this for a minute, but it might help to have an entire
poem of heliczer's to look at...


so here's one
(from _a purchase in the white botanica, the collected poetry of piero
heliczer_ 2001 Granary)


mantis

I.

there is an open scar on my right hand
which i purposely keep unbandaged
when i shake hands with some one
i am giving them perhaps more of my self than they expected
is that the right thing to do

the chestnuts burgeon above walks
in their parasols
                               green buddhashade

II.

the moment of
consent when we stop the bicycles
and go off in the hay stalks
my eyes are pumice waiting for this moment

now we can undress
there is meaning
no more sinus etcetera
so so pretty like finding money on the street

now bird songs bamboo wood
feet this old pedals reliquary
now the spokes sound
like pine needles against the sun

you have such long eye lashes to shade your violet from the sun
the foot step sinks in adams mountain
little stones grow on stems of sand
is it my blooming on old silk that is dull purple in color

i am of no use to this girl
like a prophet to his people
a pebble called the glazed insect rattling in a childs bone

do you call these things hands
gritty water on the coin
but that is what i wait for
and my dogs ears scarred with cicadas

as any stone can be chosen and erected as an idol
and worshipped and worthy of worship


III.

i cant help but give my self away
lately i fall violently ill every
time i meet a girl
                                girls
playing doctor


                                 we slept
on beds saved from the canal
the rafters like pavillions
the morning would have touched them all around like a magic trick
a very holy cloth of a blanket
still smelling slightly of some martyrs urine
le bonheur fait cri cri
sand embryos on the beach dust babies under the bed
a girl tying her hair thinking about the sea
oily water swanned by old papers
_____________________________


okay, i'm sure it's not fair of me to talk about this in light of what I
quoted from you above, as I haven't been following yr back and forth, but I
will say that heliczer interests me so much precisely because he has created
a form/voice/syntax that I'm able to enter into.  And not that I mind doing
the brain-crunch work (in fact, I get so much more out of poems I have to
work with) but heliczer really doesn't require it. I float with him and his
wounded honesty.  That's all, really I just wanted to type this poem...

noah

that, and half of it is reserved for the work of others.  So it's not a blog,
as I understand the function of blogs--if I understand.  But blogs be ok by
me (couldn't resist crowding the consonant).  Don't mind at all a peek into
the other noggin.  I agree that all these individual sites represent, in
part, a new avenue for self-publication, a pelvic muscle most writers, super
duper or itty bitty, have exercised at one time or another.  Much of my own
work on my site has already appeared on other sites or in print, so it's not
unlike an author's webpage via the UB list of favorites.  What hasn't is up
there as trial balloon--some will fly; others will crash and burn--with a
smidgen of vanity on the side.  I can live with that.

Actually, the big thrill was working on the site and getting the thing up.
I've long been a technological idiot, so finally I'm learning.  I'll send out
a call for new work in a couple of months, for the spring BLACKBOX gallery.
Maybe you, and others, will consider sending me something. Best, Bill

Jim Behrle is right. There is really no need to torture people in order to
make a point!

And Nada's blog is terrific! Check it out.

But JB, I think on this flight you can take all the carry ons you like. How
about opening your own suitcase for inspection?

There are several news aggregators that do this--try typing "news
agrregator" into Google and see what you find.  They are both web-based
and application based, and they harvest the XML of weblogs, giving you
notices when they are updated and titles with short excerts of each entry.

Of course, the site has to be set up for XML, but that is becoming more
and more popular.

I think people that blog as a practice find it to be a different process
than authorial writing;  I think that most established writers that come
to bloggging don't.  That's not wrong but it is something worth noting-

I will respond to more of this discussion over the holidays.

all the best,

Brandon

well just to correct a lingering misstep hereabouts:  when we (used
to) look at the canon, we (used to) see a general absence of women's
writing not least b/c we fail(ed) to consider letter writing as the
(in fact very public) literary activity that it was... see margaret
ezell's ~social authorship and the advent of print~---which, if not
the final word on the matter, puts a serious dent in the
male/masculinist point-of-origin view, at least in terms of the old
chestnut that the novel of western lit (presumably "invented" by men)
is the proper starting point for thinking about literature in its
more contemporary manifestation...

so the relationship of blogging to women's writing has to be turned
on its head some, if indeed this relationship is pertinent (and i
think it might be)... for one, the binary that maria offered
initially re women's writing---reactionary vs. (let's say) a modality
of subject-position contingency (maria?)---isn't to be understood as
saying that women's writing is a response to a prototypical male lit,
exactly (albeit women's writing surely has at times been a response
to a preemptive male publishing reality)... i won't bother trying to
sketch the history of women's lit here, but as many of you know and
to ease the discussion some, feminism has surely played a role right
along in this history (1st, 2nd, 3rd wave and beyond---and these
"waves" are hardly mutually exclusive)... so it's disheartening---to
me, anyway---to think that the role of feminism might be lost on
contemporary readers/writers, that one might evaluate radical women's
writing (let's say) w/o a nod toward feminism... to me, that just
doesn't wash in historical terms, not in the least...

as to blogging, well:  it can surely constitute a form of
self-publishing (and what's wrong with that?), or a desire to escape
the constant harping that one finds on lists such as this one (and
what's wrong with that?), or a desire to create a space for more
measured articulation (and what's wrong with that?), OR ejaculation
of logos in solitude... i.e., more of the same sort of
ego-gratification that more and more characterizes much of the web...
and there might be something wrong with this, on which point i find
jeffrey j's characteristically expansive post useful, albeit i wish
he hadn't picked on nada's blog...

there is an *evaluative* question here not of genre but of
singularity... we might end up concluding about this new genre (one
that mirrors perhaps older belletristic forms) that 90% of it is
fluff or puffery... but at present, given its relative newness, i
think it's incumbent upon us to keep an open mind, and be a bit
exacting about what, exactly, gives offense in a given blog---and
hey, what the hell, be nice about it!... otherwise we'll likely drift
into that same binary of evangelical praise vs. unmitigated doubt
that characterized the early years of the web, and new techne in
general...

When I posted the piece of blog humor from mnftiu.cc, I was attempting
merely to share a piece of humor.  I did not intend it as a spot
condemnation of the use of blogs, nor did I intend it as a sort of "chiming
in" against any particular person's use of a blog.  The timing was quite
coincidental, due mainly to the fact that I receive this list via daily
digest.  All things are worth a little criticism, but no thing is the end of
the universe.  It's only the river, it's only the river.

Some good points, some bad points
it'll all work out
well you know I'm a little freaked out

Mark,

Yes, it is interesting.  Watching dogs piss on a long-suffering street sign or clump of grass is a bit like watching people sign their names.  (Some even seem to do it with a flourish.)  So the parsing or reading of the scents may be like reconstructing names in a faded guestbook -- and the dates too, since, as you say, the dog's sensory universe has a fourth dimension.  It would be as if the objects we beheld with our eyes carried a date stamp on them, or slowly faded into nothingness with the passing of time.  Can my dog, I wonder, still detect somewhere in her fur the scent of her mother?  Like seeing a ghost.

Say that nouns constitute the world as objects while verbs constitute it as events.  Is a smell an object or an event?  Perhaps the dog's poem would be mostly verbs: I hunger, I exult, I hear a strange noise, I raise a furious warning, I smell the humans cooking.

This is whole area of thought is powerfully mysterious:

"After tasting a watermelon, Lucy described it as 'candy drink' or 'drink fruit', which is essentially the same word form as the English 'water melon'.  But after she had burned her mouth on her first radish, Lucy forever after described them as 'cry hurt food'.  A small doll placed unexpectedly in Washoe's cup elicited the response 'Baby in my drink'.  When Washoe soiled, particularly clothing or furniture, she was taught the sign 'dirty', which she extrapolated as a general term of abuse.  A rhesus monkey that evoked her displeasure was repeatedly signed at: 'Dirty monkey, dirty monkey, dirty monkey'.  Occasionally Washoe would say things like 'Dirty Jack, gimme drink'.  Lana, in a moment of creative annoyance, called her trainer 'You green shit'."  -- Carl Sagan, _Dragons of Eden_

(I suppose Marjorie Perloff would consider Lucy, Washoe, and Lana to be dupes of a philosophically naive poetics of referentiality and self-expression -- but then again they _were_ doing their best work in the early seventies.)

Hi Jim,



I don't think that the idea is to give Nada a hard time about her blog, but
to question the one way messaging a blog can have. Or more to the point,
what are proper post-millennial delivery systems of poetry? On-list one's
ideas are run through personal differences which can cause headaches, but
opens the playing field for poetic discussions. And good conversation should
fill the head so much it hurts. This list, prior to 9/11 was a place for
great discussions [and a source of great comfort during the crisis period of
9/11] and critical thought, very similar to what Nada and Ron reserve for
their blog.

I think that this is interesting that this tread is co-joined to Bill Austin
's page. His could be a model for a tidy delivery system. He has an author
page along with a gallery of artists.  This turns the tide of a traditional
journal by aligning oneself among a group of artists enlarging a circle of
influence.



For the headache :



There is a very different feel for comparison of the blog's. Nada is poet
with greatness on the rise, where Silliman is a running source of greatness.
I only knew from Silliman's wisdom by print books and journals. The blog
emulates a forum he is used to only in a neat to eat treat delivered hot and
fresh like a pizza. I would disagree with others who say that this is a step
down in his authorial stature, by placing information on a blog that is not
good enough for a book.



However, the blog might open artistic ideas to discussion without the
embarrassing thought that the author might be lurking around.



Best, Geoffrey

Bill.  I work selling books on Saturdays (your Fridays) (12 to 20 hours
working and heavy packing unpacking etc - very exhausting) and my brain
doesnt work too well on those days but I tend to write something (despite
exhaustion there's a kind of "buzz" one gets) I think is "profound" on a
Saturday (I have noticed that if I play Chess in this state of  (feels close
to death!) exhaustion my brain just doesnt work for me (I lose just about
every game and my rating points plummett!) - its a bit like being drunk (or
I suppose like some drugs which act more subtley than alcohol) but it is
amazing that I can still write something that approximates
rationality....however!! The gist of what I was trying to say remains: I
dont have a problem with Blogs or (I see it as manifestation of the larger
"e-project" which is in fact in reality a cojoint or possibly also and or a
cooperative procesional (of) things (or it can be - doesnt have to be
anything): where possiblities open up....I havn't looked at your site, I
will when I get time, but in a sense I see the "e-project" [ but read
generally the wider "project" of language and other innovative writing and
mulitmedia processional things and indeed the totality of Art and life] in
its totality (while not being as marvellous as some would have it) as
possibly an "answer" to Bernstein's essay  "writing and Method" and maybe to
some of the things in "A Poetics" .. the idea for absorption anti absorption
of polyvocality and so on...and if I read C B right he doesnt totally
dismiss even the "confessionals" for example (or oter "movements approaches)
but sees them as part of a general movement to trace the trace of self  etc
which is (possibly at the tail end of Modernism if that "movement is at an
end - depends how one defines it)...but that essay "Writing and Method"and
my exposure (via Wystan Curnow Roger Horrocks Murray Edmond Alan Loney and
Michelle Leggott and other of my lecturers at Auck Uni in the mid nineties
into Stein, Olson, Zuk., Williams. Moore,Bishop, Pound (these via Don Smith
and others) and others and thence the NY Schools and Language Poetry)  led
me to contemplate the Inf. Poem which began as a kind of collage of writings
(including my own ) not completely unlike ideas of Pound etc but I also was
( I cant recall thinking much about Cage though I have his ideas since and
Charles Ives ) but I also thought about Beuys's ( possibly true ) action of
refusing to teach if not everyone was enrolled in his art school..so my
project started to think about inclusivity (I first of all wanted a gnomic
and very exclusive thing - this is the advantage (or is disadvantage?) of
being - metaphorically - a split personality in my writing aaproach  - so
that in the end it - (the Inf Poem) came (conceptually at least) to
approximate the total "reality" of life lived and "art" practised. I dont
separate the arts: to me somewhow they are all part of a single human
project (in fact everything theoretically was to "pour through"  the I.P.
which is why I thought like Ashbery  ..to put everything in or then leave
every thing out!!..the brilliant thing Ron S quoted recently on his Blogg
from Three Poems which had also fascinted me...so I was/am a bit stalemated
(although Jack Ross put my "part one" of it in Brief here in Auck): now,
however, as I say, it mixes (and I feel that the whole e-project  of poetry
on the internet and Vispo -  the whole shebang - I mean...everything eevn
this I'm writing - is like a kind of huge ideational river with eg the links
that enable the "reader" to jump in space or cyber space or ideationally or
whatever and the art and so on or the links back to the List or to physical
books ..even the "jumps" into politics...the reporting of it or
refernenceing of it vocally to others and so on: the entire satura is ( yes
as I saaid  a  huge ideational river))...and I had the concept of process
which just moved on and all and anyone could be part of it - I suppose
Kerouac's ghost comes in here, and maybe Burroughs -: the only limit being
certain practical factors (so I thought well if I was to produce an actual
I. P. then I would have to decide from all submissions who was to be "in" by
throwing a dice)...but in a sense there are now so many journals and e
journals and Blogs that this is kind of preempted: of course it conceptual
mainly: and of course one still makes decisions..( at one time I conceived
of eliminating the author totally by getting various people to retype  in
any way they wanted any "source material" - which material was to come from
anywhere and every where!) but I was prepared to actually do this ( I mean
now to put everywone in!!) (eg my friend who doesnt even like poetry wanted
to "include" a quote from an book on the classifications of animals (he's
not a scientist either just enjoys intelligent "popular" science) but I was
also going to include anything in the "work" (could I include something that
excluded everything  and included itself though?!!?) (this MY blobby
Blog..)...but then I thought: well that in a sense is what is going on out
there! The old days of certain "great geniuses"  (I see Bloom has done some
monstrous thing about geniuses recently) seems to over for most of us on
this List.....BUT
as you indicate you get/got a lot of excitement fulfilment etc from the
actual doing of  your Blog (as Ron will also and others..and that's
brilliant: the commodity is thus (partly) self-consumed (nothing new here
per se except maybe the technology - the same could be gained perhaps from a
journal done by oneself or a book or books..in a different way/s)

Maybe there is a danger of islandisation? Possibly: especially cogent now
with certain  political events on the horizon. But not a problem peculiar to
blogification perhaps...hopefully not.

No apolgies for divigations and fragmentations its both how I write and how
I think and so on...and also I'm still recovering from being a bookseller
yesterday!

I might send something Bill. Good to hear (directly from you and good not to
be raging and raving about politics (we cant exclude politics though ? no?
it seems to be constantly being thrust upon us these days...)...and I
remember you were one of the first to befriend me in an e-friendly way when
I first started raving on this Poetics List !! Hope all is good for you and
others and I wish you and others a great Xmas (if I dont send more emails).

 Kind regards, Richard.  Auckland, NZ.

It takes me a while to catch up with advances in the web world. Nada's was
the first blog I ever visited. I think her comments on decoration and poetry
(through Gargantua's codpiece, full of bejeweled amazement) was brilliant
-stimulating, non-authorial, whatever this well-abused word means.-

I second this wonderful idea. let's do it; for a

Jennifer, to work at culture requires both physical and mental labor.
Nikuko, the distance gets closer as labor disappears.
Jennifer, even thought is physical labor.
Nikuko, then mental labor

I visited Nada's Blog and ws impressed. Re ornament: I've myself have been
writing deliberately over-ornamented prose poems for some time. The
"overkill" I have used as a strategy, probably somewhat derived from
Ashbery. I lke the humorous aspects of it  - the camp aspect maybe. I hasten
to say I'm not gay: which reveals the truth that I am a little "homophobic"
(actually a gay Auckland writer who is well known as a short story writer
and gets stuff on the radio is a big fan of my performed prose poems  -
especially the very  over ornamented and digressive ones!!!) (And he and I ,
afer some initial disgreements and "battles" have  now a good respect for
each other ) ( I'm not hostile though - that is  a misconception)...I cant
say else...maybe I'm also a mysoginist: never think about it much. My
feeling is that it (ornamentation and or structure) is not a more masculine
or a more femininee thing: its just that the dry, pared down poem is seen to
be what people do (a lot nowadays): whereas eg what I have seen of Chris
Stroffolino for example is not so (unornamented).  But I also tried (to
offset a tendency to blow out ) to write shorter, more cut down things: now
I noticed that that was an interesting and useful stage or "experiment": one
thing is that a poem becomes shorter and "sparer" it becomes (I feel) more
and more obvious that more words need to be ommitted.  But that's maybe been
said before and may not be true..it just seems so to me...

Voice recognition - hmmm - interesting.

The quote from Rabellias is good: important, great writer. Ornament. It
depends what works.

Structure: I didnt think a lot about structure for a long time (except in
writing essays on poems etc) and still have a problem with complex,
intricate, structure....however: no matter how instinctive or intuitive a
writer is their work will contain a structure of a kind (if not a
pre-determined water-tight, "claustrophobic?" structure), stilll a pattern
arises (almost despite attemts to impose some "opther" structure or to NOT
inmpose): no I think it is an individual thing more or less regardless of
whether one is a male, gay, female, or whatever other combination....but
these are my initial reactions.

The Blog was good...not as long and analytical as Ron's (we'll all start
comparing  the Blog's now!!) but some interesting insights and references.
And some delights....what was that:  "A jungle of chromium" Was that it ?
Refreshing. I had heard of Mina Loy but dont know her work. Will keep an eye
out.

Thanks for this link Nada and others.  Richard. Auck, NZ.

I'm not sure what straw man or woman you're tilting at, but I'm reasonably
sure that the dog's sense of I-ness depends upon its status within the
pack. Even the alpha dogs, however, probably  don't have a higher primate's
sense of selfhood. Hence, "fido smell, fritz smell, what was fifi doing
here? in  heat! pumpkins."

I don't follow your quip about Marjorie Perloff. The apes in question seem
a lot closer to language as discovery than to confessional monologue. And
of course they're not writing poetry, tho they come pretty close.

I love "cry hurt drink." Can apes sue for plagiarism?

Was Sagan not aware that "dirty" is "a general term of abuse" for humans,
too?  I justr returned from Mexico, where "pinche" serves much the same
purpose. Both are intensifiers. A dirty coward, a dirty liar. Un pinche
pendejo, un pinche cobarde. maybe we should all be issued apes to ride in
the passenger's seat and hurl invective.

Aphorisms


Take it as far as you can; frenzy awakens it.
Suck sex for the enumeration of organs.
Exhaustion eliminates the adverb like the open wound it is.
Leave the gap, there's smoke.
Where there's fire, words suffocate the mouth.
The cloth loincloth falls to pieces.
Bite God at a distance.
Honestly is the last refuge of talking forever.
If you cut out their tongs, you balk at the righteous.
Truth is a running woman.
Sit at the foot of a refugee's house.
When you seek sex, you seek geometry.
The absence of culture is always refused.
Crawl through the dung which is always renewable.
The decision against suicide brings proof to the mountain.
The valley knives the body.
Etiquette conforms paranoia.
Politeness is the best cleanser.
Etiquette is a mingling of other bodies.
Bodies guarantee.
Images guarantee the demises of damaged life.
Revel in the quantity of organisms available.
Illness increases; hatred supports it.
Bring others down with the other.
Do not do with one foot after death.
After birth is the shortest distance between two points.
The alpha and omega court the eternal.
What is never considered is the consternation of the author.
Theory is invaded by the completion of time.
Representation is the origin of negation.
The triangulation of spirit is the reception of the shadow of women.
The first invention of man is the same.
Opposition is the barrier of language.
The circuit of the slogan is a metaphor.
Nothing dissolves in the presence of speech.
Not the shadow of a doubt coheres to transcendence.

what a GREAT idea!  Bernadette Mayer recently read the book in its entirety.  wish i had been able to make it to the event.

the returning light and the poets who honor it make me think of those bards of centuries past (not that i want to venture from OUR most amazing time for poetry) who would be gathering on this day to speak by way of the pressure points on their hands with the alphabet of the sacred grove

Mall Poem | Francis Raven

Francis Raven wrote these poems, she says, "at two vastly different malls,
the Stanford Mall in Palo Alto and Union Station in St. Louis, in order to
understand the phenomenon of the mall not to mindlessly criticize it."

The mall is open, common and destroyed.
It is our own notion of destruction
manifest,
but it is also our own openness,
our field and food.
Our choices gone crazy,
elegance stripped away,
but this is not necessity either.
It is the wealth of anti-elitists
put to strange use, recreating
an elitism again in their own image.

Every object in the mall
is a great idea
metastasized.

                       from "Union Station"

Spread the word. Far and wide,

William Slaughter

Welcome to Fight Club.  The first rule about Fight
Club is: never tell anyone about Fight Club.

http://www.edward-norton.org/images/fc/poseb.jpg


Instantly after sending my post, I thought to send a
correction: "I should have written 'Nada ~Gordon's~
blog' instead of 'Nada's blog'.  She is not someone I
am on a first name basis with, and we have never met."


I was not talking about Nada Gordon's blog.  No one
was.  We were discussing ideas.  .

I was surprised she personalized it and that we were
treated to a rare List appearance.  But now that
they're talking about her, that's a good side-effect
of the discussion, that it's quadrupled the amount of
attention she would've gotten.   My pleasure to play
freebie publicity agent again.    :)



After all, what was there in her first blog entry that
could be said to be "concrete reification of self"
etc.?  (---That was just one of those "circling around
the null point" things that Barrett Watten
described.---)  That she takes public transportation
(rides the F train)?  That she teaches an introductory
course in a "fly-by-night college"?

For that matter, what is there in Ron Silliman's or
Jordan Davis' or Jonathan Mayhew's blogs that could be
called that?  That Silliman has eleven bookshelves in
his house, or that he finds the refreshments set out
at one reading series to be particularly deserving of
flattery?  That he road the F bus in San Francisco
(what is this about blog poets and their F trains and
F buses) and shopped for his own groceries there?
That Mayhew says his books are scattered among his car
trunk (that he drives), his office and his house?

We ~knew~ those were windmills, not dragons.  In a
sense, to the contrary, the blogs might not be
including ~enough~ personal information to weigh in on
their literary opinions.

*

And yet, it's so curious and sort of sad that people's
sense of self is so subjugated by ~fact.~

*

It was not the previous event of having read Nada
Gordon's blog that ~caused~ my feelings and that I was
responding to; one was just sequential after the
other.  (It's preposterous to come in chest-thumping
to defend anyone's "right" to blog, ---such gallantry
over a damsel in distress! as though women can't make
it without bodyguards,--- because it's impossible for
anybody to seriously advance the opposite position:
"No, I insist they ~don't~ have the right!")   After
reading Silliman's blog, Davis' blog, and Mayhew's
blog in their entirety, ~and then~ Nada Gordon's,

it was sort of like the menu served at that noon
luncheon for H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester at Asprey's
on 5th and 56th  back in October: after veloute of
wild mushroom with a foie gras crostini, roasted filet
of veal with caramelized Macintosh apple, braised
endive, chestnut and a celery root ravioli,--- if I
said, after the dessert of mango sorbet Vacherin with
a citrus meringue and verbena ice cream, that I'd "had
enough," that would not have meant that it was a plate
of sorbet that made me sick or that there was
something wrong with the sorbet.





Intellect aside, part of why I may have preferred
listserv and see blogs as pernicious is that---
listserv made the "class struggle" within the poetry
world (between A-list and non-citizen) permeable and
was allowing poets to come to attention who are
otherwise denied it by virtue of geography or some
other idiosyncracy.   What we're seeing with blogs, so
far, is ~celebrity~ blog.

It's a relineation of power.  Sure, Lewis Lacook
announced that he keeps a blog, but no matter how
multi-talented he may be, he's somewhere down south
with little or no face-to-face ties with the poetry
power brokers, so there was no way that his could
generate instant hype and sycophant fandom.

Listserv was bringing whole new artists into
visibility.   How will blog world do that?  No one
would know about an Alan Sondheim without listserv,
and it's questionable who would pay attention to the
blogs of the second class poetry citizens.   Without
listserv (or Yahoo! Groups), who would know about
Millie Niss' work?


(It's like that misinterpretation about why John
Ashbery would subject guests to anything like the
poetry of William McGonagal.  That's not some sort of
aesthetic commentary on "good"/"bad" taste.  He's
consistently throughout his career (and even before
there was any "career" there) championed almost
~exclusively~ the work of total unknowns, the lost,
and the never-was, like John Wheelwright, David
Schubert, Henry Green, etc., etc.  In music, the same:
that time he tried to give Joseph Cornell a Déodat de
Severac album; or Jean Francaix's music.   ---  Aside
from a sort of reverse snobbery trick of giving off
the impression that you have so completely canvassed
the work of everyone whose name is recognized that
you've moved on and are forced into the fringe of the
unheard-of,--- he seems to have remembered very
vividly his own fears that he himself would never
"make it" (a possibility that looked quite likely for
a while), and has consistently used whatever power
he's accrued to bring attention to the ~underdog,~ in
a complete breach and turn-about of poetry world power
hierarchy.)

*

The technology has been there and thriving for years,
although under a different name.  Why poets had to
wait until now (eve-of-war bunker mentality?) is
interesting: there were strong gender connotations to
the previous interface.  (…As though Total Information
Awareness might not be able to find us fast enough, so
we have to rush out into the Information Superhighway
and lay down in the middle of the road pulling "One
Way" signs around to point to ourselves.)

http://www.darpa.mil/iao/images/TIA_graphic.gif

opendiary.com has 4,255 "online diarists"; see also
freeopendiary.com.  There are even diary search
engines, like diarist.net, and the form's mere
existence is already retrospective, with sites like
diaryhistoryproject.com that "preserve the memories of
what online journalling was like in the beginning."

It's significant, though, that the diary movement had
a strong "gurlesque" or teenybopper edge to it that
poets and blog culture had to wait for a new packaging
to avoid: http://www.diaryland.com sells itself with
stereotypically girlish type font and pictures of
daisies and cartoons.  But who could seem impressively
authoritative on something called MyDearDiary.com?
Apparently, serious poets had to wait until the same
technology was re-issued under suitable marketing
(yeah, I get it: ~writer's blog~) and a new interface
and name, with all the previously too femme-feminine
connotations neutered away, graphically and literally.



*

(I'm surprised that Nick, who has been the constant
conscience against hurtful "harsh language", would
second the nomination of

"Get back to your hibernating or wait for other juicy
carrion"

which has to be some of the most violent,
stop-the-discussion, attack language we're seeing,
designed only to hurt.  ---  But then again, in this
week's Village Voice letters column, a newspaper that
reaches millions, Ange Mlinko, a poet (and former
editor of the St. Mark's Poetry Project, before Nada
Gordon) responds to Joshua Clover's article on the
Lilly grant by saying, "The idea of paying mediocre
poets not to write is a good one --- can we also pay
Arielle Greenberg to keep her ideas . . .  to
herself?" --- so maybe it's all relative.)

And--- When Professor Damon was talking about "rushing
stuff into premature 'publication' before it's been
carefully thought thru or worked into a coherent
'argument,'" you have to keep in mind the perspective
that she's thinking from: In academia, a working paper
that hasn't even been ~submitted~ for publication will
have a "thanks" or acknowledgements on its title page
for the dozen or so colleagues who ~offered comments,~
and your goal is to farm the paper around to as many
people as possible and to take it on the road for
seminars where it'll be the target of dozens of
people's most aggressive scrutiny, so that you can
incorporate that dialectic into your thinking, and see
every loophole and weak link in your argument that
working in isolation left unchallenged,--- because, if
it's even ~considered~ for publication, it'll
typically be in a ~refereed~ journal where anonymous
respondents are appointed to find even ~further~ flaws
in your thinking, which you'll have to correct and
account for before you'll ever see publication.

*

I'm all for anything that can accelerate poetry's rush
into a ~People~ magazine type mentality.  I mean it.
I expect it's only at a flood-level of total
personality-minded delirium that the general public
would have a hook to take an interest through.  And
nothing  renders concrete reified self unreal faster
than fame.

*

(About being conflict-averse, a personal anecdote:
When I was interviewing with the vocations director of
the Diocese of New York and religious orders, I was
nervous about the upcoming prospect of a regimen of
psychological testing which all religious institutions
give candidates; so I asked a psychologist friend for
advice.  She said, "There's one test [the T.A.T.]
where they show you pictures and they ask you to
narrate little stories about the scenes that you're
shown.  In some of the pictures, there are weapons.
If there is a gun in the picture, be sure to ~say~
there is a gun in the picture. . . . Otherwise, they
might think that you had some sort of ~cognitive
hole.~")

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

ACTIVIST NETWORK IN NY EVICTED FROM INTERNET BY DOW, VERIO

Bowing to pressure from the Dow Chemical Corporation, the internet
company Verio has booted the activist-oriented Thing.net from the Web.

Internet service provider Thing.net has been the primary service
provider for activist and artist organizations in the New York area
for 10 years.

On December 3, activists used a server housed by Thing.net to post a
parody Dow press release on the eighteenth anniversary of the disaster
in which 20,000 people died as a result of an accident at a Union
Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. (Union Carbide is now owned by Dow.)
The deadpan statement, which many people took as real, explained that
Dow could not accept responsibility for the disaster due to its
primary allegiance to its shareholders and to its bottom line.

Dow was not amused, and sent a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
complaint to Verio, which immediately cut Thing.net off the internet
for fifteen hours. A few days later, Verio announced that Thing.net
had 60 days to move to another provider before being shut down
permanently, unilaterally terminating Thing.net's 7-year-old contract.

Affected organizations include PS1/MOMA, Artforum, Nettime, Tenant.net
(which assists renters facing eviction), and hundreds more.

"Verio's actions are nothing short of outrageous," said Wolfgang
Staehle, Thing.net Executive Director. "They could have resolved the
matter with the Dow parodists directly; instead they chose to shut
down our entire network. This self-appointed enforcement of the DMCA
could have a serious chilling effect on free speech, and has already
damaged our business."


RTMark, which publicizes corporate abuses of democracy, is housed on
Thing.net. Please visit https://secure.thing.net/backbone/ to help
Thing.net survive Dow's and Verio's actions, and to develop a plan to
avoid such problems in the future.

seems to me that they should pull their sites off of verio's network
themselves asap...makes little sense to me to be an activists network hosted
by a multi-national telecommunications corporation...

best, i think, to buy a server or two at an independent datacenter & manage
everything themselves...

there is a lot of very intelligent understanding/critique of malls
out there, starting in the 1980s, including work by Fred Jameson,
Peter Gibian, Susan Buck-Morss, et al.  This looks like a very
interesting and compelling book of poems, but it can't claim to be
the first piece of writing to attempt to understand malls, nor can it
claim that all other work is "mindless."  i guess it's not making
those claims to uniqueness, but there's something about the last
phrase --"not to mindlessly criticize it" --that rankles.

possibly earlier than the 1980s. I can remember a grad student I admired
very much doing work on malls as "the" contemporary gathering place, a
social model of sorts that was replacing downtown centers, as early as
1976, although I dont know if that work was eventually published or not.
But I think the urge to both understand the malls in social and economic
and political context probably began not long after such malls proliferated
american suburban space. my sense of the history of malls (but not a
studied sense) is that it was later that downtown urban spaces developed
their own malls, possibly in competition with those suburban/regional centers.

Joe Strummer died last night. Cause of death unknown. London's Calling, indeed.



Johnny Appleseed

Lord, there goes Johnny Appleseed
He might pass by, in the hour of need,
There's a lot of souls...ain't drinking from no well,
Locked in a factory,
Hey look there goes, hey look there goes,
If you're after getting the honey,
Then you don't go killing all the bees,
Lord, there goes, Martin Luther King,
Notice how the door closes
When the chimes of freedom ring?
I hear what you're saying...
I hear what he's saying...
If you're after getting the honey,
Then you don't go killing all the bees,
That's what the people are saying,
And we know every road...go! go!
That's what the people are saying,
There ain't no berries on the trees...
Let the summertime sun,
Fall on the apple, fall on the apple...
Lord, there goes a Buick Forty-Nine,
Black sheep of the angels riding
Riding down the line,
We think there is a soul...we don't know,
That soul is hard to find,
Hey! Down along the road,
Down along the road...Hey!
If you're after getting the honey...
Then you don't go killing all the bees,
Hey! It's what the people are saying
There ain't no berries on the trees...
You came to skim off the honey, baby,
And you had to go killin' all the bees.


--Joe Strummer

LONDON (Reuters) - Joe Strummer, frontman with the Clash whose 1979
track "London Calling" exploded as one of punk's biggest anthems, has died at
the age of 50, a spokesman said on Monday.

The singer, guitarist and songwriter died at his home in Somerset, western
England of unknown causes.

"We do not yet know the cause of death, but we believe it was not suspicious
and that he passed away peacefully. An autopsy will be forthcoming," the
spokesman said.

Born John Graham Mellor in Ankara, Turkey, Strummer's talents propelled him
from busting on the London Underground to fame with the Clash, who with the
Sex
Pistols came to define the in-your-face sound and style of 1970s British punk.

Until they split in the 1980s, the Clash produced a catalog of punk classics,
including "Career Opportunities" and "Should I Stay or Should I Go?,"
distilling the depression, anger and energy of 1970s Britain.

But they transcended the three-chord aggression to deliver messages of anti-
racism and social consciousness.

Strummer, the son of a British diplomat, wrote many of the band's biggest hits.

"He was one of the most important figures in modern British music, a powerful
performer and a wordsmith on the same level as Bob Dylan," said Pat Gilbert,
editor of British music magazine Mojo

"His music had compassion and vision, backed with an agenda to change the
world
for the better...I was shocked to hear of his death," he told Reuters.

Sometimes described as rebels with a cause, the Clash fused a variety of
musical styles -- reggae, dub, funk and even rap -- with a political message
that brought punk to the mainstream and also found big success in the U.S.
market.

In 1976 Strummer met a then 23-year-old guitarist Mick Jones and linked up
with
bassist Paul Simonon and drummer Terry Chimes. As the Clash, the quartet made
an immediate and explosive impact in Britain.

Rolling Stone magazine called their 1977 eponymous debut "The definitive punk
album."

Follow-ups "Give 'Em Enough Rope" (1978), and "London Calling" (1979) also
became instant punk classics. After The Clash split, a tireless Strummer
stayed
center stage with a variety of projects, dabbling in acting and writing music
for films.

More recently, Strummer toured with a new band, the Mescaleros, and played a
benefit concert with Mick Jones in November, reuniting with his partner in
punk
for the first time in nearly 20 years.

At the time of his death, Strummer was collaborating with U2's Bono and Dave
Stewart, formerly of the Eurythmics, on an AIDS awareness track.

"The Clash are to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year
and
there was hope that there would be a reunion and a tour...this must be
especially sad for their fans," Gilbert said.

His death is a double blow for punk fans still mourning the fatal drug
overdose
in June of singer Dee Dee Ramone from legendary American band the Ramones.

Strummer is survived by his wife, two daughters and one stepdaughter.

Thanks all for the comments on malls.  My initial introduction to the poem
was dumb.  Charles point is especially interesting.  They might be like
television in that with their rise came implicit criticism of them, but not
their demise.  Somehow both television and malls are visited and utilized
even though everyone knows the basic criticisms of them.  It's also
interesting for me to think about the difference between malls in different
climates.  Obviously, midwestern malls have to be enclosed whereas malls in
miami beach do not, a fact which might alter how they are used and what they
do to people.  Charles last point is especially interesting to me: that
urban areas developed malls to compete with suburban malls.  Maybe this is
where the locus of power shifts.  Well, thank you again for your interesting
comments on malls, if you get a chance I'd love it if you read the poems, in
the meantime I'm trying to think of something to change the blurb to,

Cyberspace Artists Paint Themselves Into a Corner

December 23, 2002
By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL






In a 1950's horror movie the Thing was a creature that
killed before it was killed. Now in a real-life drama
playing on a computer screen near you, the Thing is an
Internet service provider that is having trouble staying
alive. Some might find this tale equally terrifying.

The Thing provides Internet connections for dozens of New
York artists and arts organizations, and its liberal
attitude allows its clients to exhibit online works that
other providers might immediately unplug. As a result the
Thing is struggling to survive online. Its own
Internet-connection provider is planning to disconnect the
Thing over problems created by the Thing's clients. While
it may live on, its crisis illustrates how difficult it can
be for Internet artists to find a platform from which they
can push the medium's boundaries.

Wolfgang Staehle, the Thing's founder and executive
director, said the high-bandwidth pipeline connecting the
Thing to the Internet would be severed on Feb. 28 because
its customers had repeatedly violated the pipeline
provider's policies. While the exact abuses are not known,
they probably involve the improper use of corporate
trademarks and generating needless traffic on other sites.

If Mr. Staehle is unable to establish a new pipeline, the
100 Web sites and 200 individual customers, mostly artists,
that rely on the Thing for Internet service could lose
their cyberspace homes. In a telephone interview from the
Thing's office in Chelsea, Mr. Staehle (pronounced
SHTAW-luh) said, "It's not fair that 300 of our clients
will suffer from this and I might be out of business."

The Thing's pipeline is currently supplied by Verio Inc. of
Englewood, Colo., which declines to comment on its troubles
with the Thing. Mr. Staehle said that he had not received
official word from Verio, but that the company's lawyers
told the Thing the service would be cut off because of the
violations.

For some digital artists, these are perilous times. With
the Internet's rise have come increased concerns about
everything from online privacy to digital piracy. Naturally
artists are addressing these matters in Internet-based
works. So an online project about copyright violations
inevitably violates some copyrights, and a work that warns
how a computer could be spying on you could very well be
spying on you.

Most Internet service providers yank such works offline
whenever legal challenges are raised, so open-minded
providers like the Thing become an important alternative.
But as Alex Galloway, a New York artist, said, "There
really are no true alternative Internet service providers
because connectivity is still controlled by the
telecommunication companies."

Mr. Staehle has learned this the hard way. The project that
overheated Verio's circuits was probably a Web site created
by an online group of political activists called the Yes
Men. The site, at dow-chemical.com, resembled Dow
Chemical's real site, at dow.com. But the contents were
phony news releases and speeches that ridiculed Dow
officials for being more interested in profits than in
making reparations for a lethal gas leak at a Union Carbide
plant (now owned by Dow) in Bhopal, India, in 1984.

The hoax's supporters said it was a parody. But Dow's
lawyers contacted Verio to complain that the site infringed
on its trademarks, among other sins. Initially it seemed to
be just another fracas over corporate logos and other forms
of intellectual property on the Internet.

What happened next stunned Mr. Staehle. The Yes Men project
had been put online by RTMark.com, a politically active
arts group that uses the Web as its base and gets its
Internet service from the Thing. After Dow complained about
the fake Web site, Mr. Staehle said, Verio alerted the
Thing, where a technician said he was not authorized to
act. Within hours Verio cut off access to RTMark.com, as
well as to all the Thing's Internet customers. These
included innocent victims like Artforum magazine and the P.
S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens.
Starting mid-evening on Dec. 4, the Thing was offline for
16 hours.

Ted Byfield, a Thing board member who teaches a course at
the Parsons School of Design on the social effects of
technology, would not call Verio's action censorship.
Instead he said, "They hit the panic button." He compared
the temporary shutdown to a meat packer who recalls all his
beef products after discovering a small batch of tainted
hamburger.

Mr. Staehle soon discovered that his virtual supermarket
might be permanently closed, too. When he called Verio to
ask why his entire network had been unplugged instead of
the sole offending site, he said, a Verio lawyer told him
that the Thing had violated its policies repeatedly and
that its contract would be terminated.

Verio had shut down part of the Thing once before. In 1999
the online toy retailer eToys.com asked a California court
to stop an online arts group from using its longtime Web
address etoy.com. The Electronic Disturbance Theater, a
Thing client, staged a virtual protest by overloading the
retailer's site with traffic during the holiday season.
Verio blocked access to one of the Thing's computers until
the protest site's owners agreed to take it offline.

These two episodes may give Verio enough cause to bump the
Thing from the Internet. If so Verio would appear to be a
surprising censor. In January the company earned praise
from Internet-rights supporters when it refused to grant a
request by the Motion Picture Association of America to
shut down a Web site containing DVD-copying software.

Mr. Staehle said he had no knowledge of the Yes Men site.
"I am not in the business of policing my clients," he said.
"I am just a carrier."

Although some Thing customers pursue a radical political
agenda, most do not. Even RTMark.com was included in the
Internet-art section of the 2000 Whitney Biennial
exhibition.

One might assume that museums and other cultural
organizations could provide a safe haven for challenging
works. But they are just as susceptible to legal threats
and technical restrictions. For instance, in May the New
Museum of Contemporary Art in New York was forced to remove
a surveillance-theme artwork from the Internet after its
service provider said it violated its policies.

Mr. Staehle said he was considering several plans that
would keep the Thing alive. While he is confident that he
will find another pipeline provider, he said, he is worried
that customers will abandon the Thing during the
transition, financially ruining it.

The Thing is one of the oldest advocates of online culture.
Mr. Staehle, who moved to New York from his native Germany
in 1976, started the Thing in 1991 as an electronic
bulletin board where artists could exchange ideas about how
the new medium would affect the arts. The electronic forum
continues at bbs.thing
.net, where artists post projects and review works.


Charles Guarino, Artforum's associate publisher, said that
should the Thing vanish, "it would be a terrible loss." But
he noted that the Thing's customers would simply find new,
if less sympathetic, Internet service providers. Mr.
Guarino said, "Everyone will still continue to exist,
probably even the people who got them into all this trouble
in the first place." He added, "Poor thing."

Last night - in addition to having the great pleasure of re-reading
Bernadette M's "Midwinter's Day" - I was at a talk by a mathematician, Dr.
Robert Osserman, whose book is The Poetry of the Universe. In part what was
interesting to me was his analysis of "is", as in the phrase, "The universe
is a stable shape."    Apparently, if you map the universe as a series of
concentric circles extending out from the earth, instruments can currently
reach to a distance of 20 billion light years.  But here's the problem of
"is":  What we are seeing - in terms of time - is the light of the first
day" (i.e., "the big bang") of the universe.  So the "is" ness of the outer
limit of what we see is not reflective of a linear history at at all, but,
the continuous presence we continue to see (and live with) the universe at
its originating moment.
I have not begun to think of the ramifications of this all present "is" in
the light of the poem, or in the light of how time occurs within the
structure of a poem, where phrases dip in and dip out of different spaces
and times, but work to cohere as a "present time" within the poem, negating
any mind drift into chronological linearity - and the sentimentality of
nostalgic response that such may evoke. Ashberry's work here rings a bell as
being an adept at this.

Osserman's vision was indeed a sweet gift to receive on the day of the
return of light.

Happy holidays,

Stephen Vincent

I propose to edit a Schiz Lit Anthology (see below-- it's a way of writing,
not a pathology), initially for Web and hopefully in print.  The entries
will cosists of 10 poieces (poems, unreal prose, creative nonfiction) by
established or emerging writers with no connection to mental illnes or
psychosis and 10 entries from people who have actually experienced psychotic
episodes.

I plan to be highly selective and produce an anthology someone would want to
read, should they ever read experimental literature.  For exxmple, the best
Schiz* Lit that I know was done by Clark Coolidge, James Tate, Jackson Mac
Low/Anmne Tardos, Patrick McCabe, R.S. Jones, John Hollander (only in some
works like Powers of Thirteen), John Yau etc., not to mention many talented
younger writers I've met on the net or semn work of on the Poetics list.

The book will be produced with the author's names and the bios in the back
so that readers are left guesss who is a "real writer" and who is a mental
patient.

TO SUBMIT: Please send work to Millie Niss at men2@columbia.edu before April
1. Response will be in April, at its worst, but you may hear back sooner.
Please let me know which category you want to be in,  Don't call yourself a
mental patient for this purpose if you are able to work and earn your own
living, unless you have eperienced psychotic symptoms or severe mania, take
an antipsychotic, or were hospitalizaed and forced into the full-time world
of the mentlly ill with its day programs and residences etc.

All contributors should write  a brief bio including past writing
experience, and mental health history if relevant  If you have both
backgrounds (mental illness and working as a writer), then either choose an
identifty or else say in the bio that you are surviving despite being sick,
which should be good news to all.
____________________________________________________________________________

Below are the basic charateristics of Schiz* Lit.  If you have a small piece
that uses any of these techniques, please submit it.  The Martians will be
very happy! :)
____________________________________________________________________________
______________________

What is Schiz* Lit?

It is literature that (usually deliberately) uses the thought patterns found
in schizophrenia and other thought disorder based mental illnesses.  Schiz*
Lit forms a large part of "experimental writing" today, and is generally
written by perfectly sane people.  Characterstics of Schiz* Lit:

        * tangentential thinking-- (on the part of the character or the narrative)
story moves from related aubject to reated subject but never gets anywhere
or at least not where it seemed to be going
        * derailment -- entire story gets taken over by another story for no reason
except perhaps a coincidence (common in Schiz* Lit) or a "clang association"
(encounter with a word that sounds like the word previously debing discussed

        * odd syntax, neologisms, circumlocutions to name things (ie "that
leatherbound God thing" for "Bible"  People who really do have a mental
illness do this because they have forgotton the regular word, but the effect
can be arresting). invented languages of one's own

        * no plot or an absurd one

        * perseveration -- repetition with minor variations so that narration ends
up ranting at the reader

        * elements of paranoia or grandiosity

        * ideas of reference -- things that happen in the outside world have
special meaning for a character, unrelated to any rational connection  (ie a
church bell convinces person that they must flee Pennysylvania becuase they
are the secret theif of the Liberty Bell)  The ideas of reference can be in
the narration as well--- the narrator or plot cann involve the relating of
unrelated things

        * bizarre, inexplicable behavior.  Often done by secondary characters
whiile main character acts "perfectly normal" -- or so he thinks

        * weird humor: funnny in a very prticular, rather intellectual but also
potentially side splitting, way, often due to logical incongruities or
visual/object incongruities

        * voices:  talking plants (or plants with feelings), animals, mailboxes,
jewelry, holy objects, etc.  Or else character hears voices.  Or voices are
"really" present, urging charcter to
join a nonexistent cause or to perform silly rituals

        * visions:  in literature, often of dead people, but can be of anything.
Insects are common.  Little green men who know the meaning of life.  Tolstoy
reading War and Peace (in serbo croation) at his own grave, crossing out the
longueurs...

        * word salad: combinations of words that don't make sense at all but may be
evocative, ege Jacson Mac Low's Twenties or much of Brice Andrews.

        * hebephrenia: silliness and inability to stick to anything either real or
serious

        * lack of emotional depth or else agitation and over-intensity (in
narration or character)

Death or Glory


Every cheap hood strikes a
Bargain with the world
And ends up making payments on a
Sofa or a Girl
Love 'n' hate tattooed across the knuckles of
His hands
The hands that slap his kids around cos they don't
understand...
How death or glory becomes just another story

'N' every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock n' roll
Grabs the mike to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this--and it's been tested by research
That he who fucks nuns will later join the church

From every dingy basement on every dingy street
I hear every dragging handclap over every dragging feet
That's just the beat of time--The beat that must go on
If you been trying for years--Then we already heard your song

Check out the radio piece Sean Cole produced featuring me at:

http://wnyc.org/shows/tnbt/episodes/current

Rich Verse

One of the strangest news stories of this year has to be the announcement
that POETRY Magazine is the proud recipient of a $100 million bequest. We’re
left wondering… what on earth are they going to do with $100 million? Next
Big Thing contributor Sean Cole trails poet Jim Behrle as he attempts to
live the life of a poet and a millionaire for a day.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

YOUR POETRY

Your poetry makes me feel a little underdressed. For your
butterflies are cute. They make
me think "thank you." (And I didn't even say "MAKES MINE
LOOKS LIKE QUIVERING JELLY!") Visons,
makes my mind word to figure out the coded puzzles.

Thanks be to the one who suggested your web site.
For I will visit often.
For the world has an ethereal quality to it.
For music touches my heart chord.
For I'm not the only person with "the same problems."
Thank you.
Even in the form of a migraine.
Just like a gothic Martha Stewart.
Furthermore, the experience of reading your poetry, makes it difficult
for me to learn that you are only 17.

You are truely a talented elfwood lysator.
Snippity snip fucking snip. Your
poetry makes me PEE MY PANTS, Little Sister.
That's a GOOD thing.
Your poetry makes me want
to bang my head on the computer desk over and over.

i like poetry a lot, and i'll send it to this list, and
you will like it too, because i like your poetry,
your poetry makes for a good result here and there
and I want to provide a publishing arena where your poetry
makes a difference to others as well as yourselves
let's let others know what it feels like to make sense.

You know we were talking about Vietnam
but your poetry makes it clear that the
American obsession, commitment to violence,
has extended well beyond that.

I'm not posting my stuff anymore because
Your poetry makes mine look really stupid! :oP.

Your poetry makes
me kinda sad
that you do this....
not that I can talk.

Your poetry makes me think that you're the first
to understand, the first to make this sea-
sick shark see land

Your poetry makes me CRY! You're a good poet, but
you're CRAZY. Hearing
you read was like grinding razor blades down my ear canal!
I can only paint the echoes that your poetry makes
onto the earth of my ears.

As reported recently in the New York Times, Andre Breton's studio at
42 Rue Fontaine, Paris, which has been kept intact since his death,
is about to be dismantled and its contents sold at auction. Following
is a petition of protest, urging instead the establishment of a
museum.

If you want to participate, please add your name to the bottom and
email a copy to J Karl Bogartte <bogartte@execpc.com>, who is
administering the petition.

hey check out my attention span, the fine grain of where I come from. and my
participation, which is the sound of my thumb, on the book or door, your
languor seeing my quotient. listen, I've got to reread my own mess. did I
show details just now or was I yawning? there's no difference between the
two but I've got to make a point. I know about Joe Strummer, and I know
where I am. in my career, that is: I've got quality. I've got a voice and
plan to remain votive. in the votive booth, that is. this is my ear. every
year, I listen for the manifest. it is trumpet, or screw up, who cares now?
I've got a target audience, and you know about squids. in our combined
diction, something must fail. let that failure be your career, mine has too
much moxie. I am telling you straight. I've been at it and arraigned. I've
been attached to a square, basically. I will shower recently, then let all
reports fall mute. that's going the long route but believe me, the noise
will be peculiar. this is the attachment to the last message, there is
something in my ear. still. it is my latest attention span, such as space
inheres with. alas, provocative paint spatter in the inkling of morning, can
you spell my name correctly? neither can I.

I've started my own blog, "Elsewhere," on poetics and culture(s).

It's at:

http://garysullivan.blogspot.com/

In the first blog:

Turkish poet Orhan Veli. Comparisons of translations of Veli's work by Talat
Sait Halman and Murat Nemet-Nejat. My own "translation" of one of Veli's
poems.

MINSTREL IN THE GALLERY


Welcome shy one.  You are very talented ... your poetry will be published
very soon at the house of dark phantom.

Please write in poetic form the story of Sri Rama as narrated to you by
Narada.  After reading it your life and your poetry will never be the same
again.  God Bless you as you live and write for His glory!  You are a
blessing not only to our Church but to everyone your poetry will reach out
and touch!

Please DO NOT type in all caps!  Your poetry will sing without them.
Indulge a lady in her beauty and your poetry will die a thousand deaths.
Buried in the flesh of this woman your poetry will escape.  One truth could
easily extinguish another.  Pay service to the gods; for all your piety,
death will tear you from the temple and hurry you into the grave.  Think you
your poetry will save you?  Wait and see.  I wait for you to be heavy with
the implications of sleep and velvet scents.  Here, your poetry will be
preserved till Atlas sets down his burden at the end of time.

I will look over your poem and if I like then "wala" your poetry will be
found on my page.  Your poetry will be written from the heart (mine) as best
as I possibly can express it.  Your poetry will be broken down to word
usage, structure, mood, and idea.  The top-level critique.

I have a sort of sense of where your poetry will be in a year or three,
makes me shiver.  I think that your poetry will change in the same way as
your painting.  I feel strongly with you and I believe your poetry will
live.  Be careful of bad people but yes your poetry will get out there.  As
an artist, whatever you make will always be here.  The world was created
with words.  Awesome motherfucking poetry.  Go, seize the opportunity.

The sun which is also in your future does show success and good things.
Your poetry will introduce itself and your name to many strangers.  When
people read your poetry, your name will appear on the page, identifying the
poetry.  Your poetry will be considered better than all the poets that ever
came before you.  When everybody else is gone, your music, your art, your
poetry will always be there.  Your poetry will be archived in some of the
most prestigious libraries in America, including more than half of the Ivy
League.  This is not all.  Publishing your poetry will make you rich in ways
you never imagined.  You rhyme so very well, I can tell ... your poetry will
sell!!  The sky is the limit, your poetry will sell, if publishers frown on
Social Justice Poetry, then damn them to HELL!  You do not need these
losers.

Never confuse free verse with 'freedom from rules', however, or your poetry
will not hold up well under scrutiny.  You cannot write poetry without
rhythm, and your poetry will never have rhythm if you do not study meter,
foot, and line.  Your poetry will never be that good.  Critics who read your
poetry will raise an eyebrow because it is very simplistic.  Whatever you
have set store by, your dress, your dinner, your poetry, will go wrong.  If
you hope that your poetry will change the world, give it up.  How do you
think your poetry will help others?  If poetry is your way of not having a
life, then your poetry will not give life.  Do you think your poetry will
remain in the annals of Russian literature?  One thing's for sure--your
poetry will never get you elected.  Never.  No joke.

Q: I absolutely love your poetry!  I love it.  It has so many points!!  Will
you be having more published in the future?
A: Thanks very much!  I recall with pleasure 'the cobweb silk of nightfall'
and 'my poetry is redundant.'  I think I said something like that.  Recent
poems are in blue lettering.

"Your poetry will definitely make a girl's head spin," Brenda crooned as she
picked up a piece of passion fruit.

Take heart, poets.  The real test of your poetry will be in its endurance,
its persistence beyond the moment when your words are hurled at the
audience.  What is your poetry saying about you? Are you proud of it?  Come
visit us here down under and your poetry will be more alive with "kissing"
kangaroos.  The very flow of your poetry will change direction.  Your music
and your poetry will never die ... happy 50th anniversary ... continue to be
a "Minstrel in the Gallery."

You have always been fidel to your ideas.  You have good feeling in your
words.  The range and depth is evident for all to see.  I really hope you
can find happiness in your life then your poetry will reflect this too.
Your poetry will grow with your age.  Your poetry will help you your whole
life through and you'll always be able to take a step bigger than you
usually would.  Your poetry will fill this cottage with warmth and light.

Gary,

I think your translation of "suicide" is great, doing what I hoped my
suggestion would do: making Orhan Veli a tabula rasa, a mysterious other
around which to spin riffs. Not that different from what Armand was doing
with his "tablets."

Are you kidding?  The only time I ever stayed out all night on line in
front of a box office was to get tickets to see The Clash at Bonds in
1980...something.  I actually don't remember the year for sure, but it
was the Sandinista tour.

So, yeah, we poets and poeticists certainly know who Joe Strummer was.

Oh yeah? I couldnt keep straight who were the Clash, the Cars or the Police.
I could always tell when it was Charles Tyler, though.

George B, which Clash album do you need me to copy for you?

Billy Bragg (another leftist British singer/songwriter I admire) wrote a
fairly articulate eulogy which appeared yesterday on Yahoo.  Did any of you
see it?  He hit the nail on the head: without Strummer, the Clash wouldn't
have been political, & without the Clash in that role punk wouldn't have
been political.  (It still sorta wasn't, I sez, but it's hard to
overestimate Strummer's role in moving the music toward a sense of social
awareness without a lot of Bob Geldoff pat-yourself-on-the-back We Are The
World liberal crap).

There was sometimes an honesty about class, & about the stakes of small
issues like war, in their songs-- which was refreshing then, as now.

Very, very sad to hear the news.

& I still wish I'd gone to see the Clash at the Royal Oak (Michigan) Roller
Rink, when I was about 18 years old.

When I saw Joe Strummer I thought it was a joke...actually I've never heard
of him so here I am throw things at the man with his head in the hole: if he
is or was a jazz musician or pop musician I'm absolutely uninterested...and
I have never been interested in such even as a teenager.
But I'm a very dull person and live a very dull life: today I just played
over some chess games, listened to Bach - the only musician to listen to
..nothing sles ies needed... and muttered to myself....and the cat: which
deigned not ot reply, even when I asked it, rater hopefully if it knew who
Joe Summer was.
But if its some sort of in joke I've missed the joke.....jez its hot here
today!

 So, there you are. Merry Xmas all same. Richard.

I had tickets when I was learning to drive, back in '83, but couldn't figure
out how to find the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Should've thought of
something. Regretted it ever since.

I think that there is an argument to what B. Bragg says about The Clash's
insertion of politics in punk. Though I think the X-Ray Specs had some great
songs of social alienation that were thoughtful enough to see that evolution
as, perhaps, inevitable.

The punk scene in San Francisco was very politically active, to a point that
it alienated and divided the scene. The climax, as I saw it, was the
demonstration outside of the Democratic Convention in 1984 with a gig just
outside on Mission Street with a line-up that included The Dicks, MDC, and
the Dead Kennedy's. Later everyone walked down to the Convention Center and
got their heads shit canned in by cops on horse back. The interesting thing
was how the whole thing received not one word in the mainstream press, but
did merit a nice full layout, with pictures, in The Daily Worker. What fine
days. The Clash had much influence on the people I knew then, and continue
to know. We were very young and excited by what they where capable of. Joe
Strummer's passing is sobering.

I think of Kathy Acker when I think of writing and punk. That kind of wrong
vitality that can, with a brush stroke, change and charge the ground under
our feet.

So enjoy the sun there Richard, and crank up the Bach. In the words of The
Clash: Go Easy, Step Tight, and Stay Free.

I am not necessarily looking for poersonal experiences, even when I ask for
work by consumers.  You can write fiction or poetry.  The idea though, is
that someone who has experienced psychosis would have a particular style of
fiction or poetry if they were able to be in touch with, but in control, of
the psychotic side of things.

On the other hand, there is a trend in literature towards SchizLit, it just
hasn't been isolated into an anthology.  Some writers may take exception to
my terminology, but the list of charactertistics I gave for Schiz lit are
definitely in contemporary poetry, exspecially, but not only, in
experimental forms.  That is why I hope to get contributions from mainstream
(not mentally ill) experimental writers.

What I find curious is the convergence betwen these techniques and the
definitions of thought disorders.  This is not to pathologize the potry but
to suggest that poetry, havig to do as it does with "making strange," makes
strange thought processes in its narrative structure.  That these correspond
to pattrerns people have who have mental problems is not all that
surprising.  Some people say that we are all a bit psychotic in our dreams,
and there are those who say experimental poetry is dream logic rather than
awake logic.

Personally I take it back further, to Rimbaud who wanted the "dereglement de
tous les sens" [decalibration of all the senses] and literally drove himself
crazy in order to write the Illuminations and other prose poetry.  He
deprived himself of sleep, took drugs, got drunk, etc -- all things that
would lead to the development of schizzy thought patterns.

Later authors have not found it becesary to engage in these wild pursuits,
but have been able to imagine: what if I were paranoid?  What if my thoughts
derailed in all directions rather than going logically?  What if I believed
that everything affected everything else but that I was at its center?  This
is what an author such as Jame Tate has done, and several of his books have
one the Pulitzer Prize, proving to me that Schiz Lit is "in"

As and example, here is a poem from "Distance from Loved Ones" called
"Bewitched"

I was standing in the lobby,
some irritant in my eye,
thinking back on a soloist
I once heard in Venenzuela,
and then for some reason
on a crate if oranges recently
arrived from a frined in Florida,
and then this colleague came up to me
but I was certain I was standing there naked
and I was certain she could read my thoughts,
so I tried to hide them quickly,
I was embarassed that there was
no apparent connection t them,
will-o'-the-wisps, and i needed an alibi
so I told her I had seen a snapshop
of a murder victim recently
thet greatly resembled her,
and that she shoulld take precaution,
my intonation getting me into deeper trouble,
and I circled the little space I had cut out,
as if looking for all the sedereal years
she had inquired into moments before,
and the dazzling lunar poverty of some thoughts
had me pinned like a moth
and my dubious tactic to hide my malady
had promped thuis surreptitious link
to the whilrling Sufi dancers,
once so popular in these halls.
"It's five minutes pasty four," I said,
knowing I had perjured myself for all time.
I veered into the men's room,
astonished to have prevailed,
my necktie, a malediction, stapled in place,
my zipper synchronized with the feminie motive.
In Zagreb just now, a hunter is poaching som cherries.

Note that it doesn't do all of the Sciz Lit techniques, only a few of them.
But that they truly inform the poem.

--- Millie I actually don't remember (I'm sure
repressed) a lot of my psychotic experiences.  This is
too bad, because I am sure that they would make for
interesting reading.  Can you give the name of some of
this Lit that has been published though?
        On the other hand, the more I think of it, the more I
think I may have something to contribute...I'll let

as far as punk & politics & The Clash, it should be noted that they WERE on
a major label and had gotten a lot a lot of shit for the selling out of
punk,  of the image of rebellion, etc. As there were political punk bands at
the time--namely Crass, later the Dead Kennedys--able to produce their own
records...thus not entering into the web of commerce which brought a profit
for the same folks they were critiquing...

just a thought..noah

This just in...an announcement for yet another blog.  I don't think this is
quite the typical blog, however, as it appears to be interested in blurring
the lines of self and identity.  It seems to focus on poetry itself, but not
so much poets.  Part travelogue (Lester is in Cambodia for the Holidays),
part poetry, part commentary, part dungeon, part group sex.

Lester is a ventriloquist doll.  As puppets are known to do, he'll
apparently say whatever you put in his mouth.  He says you just have to pull
his string.  He's quite screwed up in his empty head but he's entertaining;
he brings a little vaudeville to the poetry world (but vaudeville updated
for the internet age).

i don't want to be the bearer of bad news along the Moselle,

had enough barbarians pressed hard against the gate -

Lesbia stood by the bronze auracular
you could read her future if you knew the future
her hands fluttered in sacred cords
Luna Celesta, heard murmurs in the distance
it is love and sex, it is death and hard marl
the grain of the metal of the blade of the sword
behind the auracular, shapes of dragons, pearls
they're here in the world
they're unfurled
the edges of the auracular curled
turbulence, the violence of the pair
there was hardly anyone there
Lesbia and Veneres Cupidinesque were bare
the stones of the auracular murmuring and austere
humans behind the stones of the auracular
i don't want to be the bearer of bad news beyond Moselle
Veneres Cupidinesque was behind her
Veneres Cupidinesque's hands made flame-cast shadows

I always thought that the clash weren't real punk like the sex pistols or
patti smith, or some other bands that folks have mentioned.  that they
were opportunists who glommed onto the scene. But here it is now 25
years later and they're held up as official punksters.

The idea about punk that I really liked was that anyone can do it, the
DIY attitude, and the clash were just too good to be real DIY. Other
people thought at the time that punk was just a cynical ploy to sell
records.

huh? what? sex pistols not opportunists (fab 4 plus snot)?
suicidal tendencies are real punks but not the clash?

like any fertile art movement punk moved in several
directions (and locales) at once. punk is elvis
costello singing "radio, radio" on saturday night live as
much as it's the sex pistols not showing up for the gig.

so i wouldn't dismiss the clash for not being the ramones.
i suspect (not to pick on you, josh) that the
paint-by-numbers simplification of the genre by later
derivative bands like green day and rancid is what might
make the clash seem "too good" now.

as a memorable commercial of a few years ago had it
(our speaker looking as though he was born about 1980),
"Remember in the seventies, when rock got all boring and
corporate, and then punk came along and shook things up?
Well, that's kind of like the new VW Passat ..."

I'm the man who cries
because the moon won't turn
corners with me. In this
prolific universe, certainties

can resusitate a telescope
from almost certain boredom
on a screened-in porch;

in restaurant chatter, my love
orders the potato-skins, I

a sliver of my own shadow
uncoupled from the tracks.
I know it's me because the kids

still throw rocks, even when
I turn the corner. Their laughter

follows me much the same way
you do: all purple and overfed,
scrolling out from under my feet.
Why do you waste so much time

moving so far away, when
even when I turn the corner I'm
the same man?

everything is being used to sell everything. I first noticed the
beatle's hey jude as musck  in 1982, Ginesburg sold the rights to
Howel, and didn't for get the rolling stone, I think Dylan sold the
rights to jumpin jack flash 15 year ago.. whats not up for grabs, maybe
some poetry...homelessness...no there is a whole business around them
for poetical oppression and support, i was going to say L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E
..BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A COTTAGE INDUSTRY AROUND THAT..

it only counts in the moment it happens as radical...may and not...
lets face it even the sex pistols became and still are a huge
commodity.. its all up for sale.

I'm finding it hard to imagine that anyone could say that the Clash "weren't real punks like the Sex Pistols..." They were at ground zero of the Britpunk xplosion. They played together  many times in 1976/77. They were THERE- that's all there is to it.

Did they "sell out" to a major label? This could be a neverending debate choc-fulla back & forths, but let's consider this: The Clash (hardly top-tier in CBS sales)fought tooth & nail to have Columbia release a sprawling, experimental 3-record project called Sandinista. This, in the glory days of Reagan/Thatcher red-baiting.
Their considerable distribution brought class consciousness to alot of (pre-internet)kids who never would've found their way to a CRASS album.

The Clash brought reggae, soul, funk & rap to kids all over that otherwise might not have given it a chance. Not as "great white fathers", but more like directional pointers- encouraging us to move thru new genres & not let our haircuts define what music we listen to.

On their final tour, their opening act was 14 Karat Soul-an a capella group of five black kids from Jersey. It freaked out alot of mohawks- sore because they didn't get what they expected from a "punk" show. That, my friend, IS punk rock.

The Sex Pistols, whatever they became, were CREATED by their manager,
Malcomb McLaren, exactly as "a cynical ploy to sell records."  The Clash
formed shortly afterward-- their first show was with the Sex Pistols, I
think in 1976.  They were all muscians on the London scene-- Joe Strummer
had his own band, which he abandoned when he was asked by Jones & Simonon to
be the singer for the band that they were forming.  Johnny Rotton, on the
other hand, wasn't on the London music scene I don't think, but was
"discovered" by McLaren because he embodied the image of punk that McLaren
was trying to sell.  If you listen to the two bands, it's clear that the
Clash weren't imitating anybody, least of all the Pistols.  The Pistols
became known as "punk" in the USA before anybody here had heard of the
Clash, mainly because workers at a factory supposedly refused to press one
of the band's early singles (I think it was "God Save the Queen") because
they thought it offensive-- and that story made the U.S. papers, no doubt
released by McLaren.  Of course the single was produced, & the Pistols went
on to a U.S. tour.  It would be a few years, meanwhile, before the Clash's
record company allowed their records to be released in the U.S.  But the
whims of record companies and the machinations of the Sex Pistols' manager
have nothing to do with the Clash's authenticity.

> it only counts in the moment it happens as radical...may and not...

Kari, I'm not sure I agree that there is a moment where
something's radical which thing then gets co-opted and
commodified. I mean, obviously, using the Beatles'
"Revolution" in a Nike commercial is commodification on an
infinitely more horrible level (thanks Michael Jackson)
than that of the song's original release, but it did begin
life, socially speaking, as a commodity which was ALSO a
radical statement. (If you read the Rolling Stone
interviews with Lennon around the time of the Beatles
breakup, you see him wondering about his most radical
album, Plastic Ono Band, which song should be the first
single.)

Seems like one reason punk is interesting is because it
pushes the radical commodity oxymoron to an extreme. What's
more pop than "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker"? It's got a good
beat and you can pogo to it. Or more radical than the
Descendants writing songs like the one-word-long "All!"

Makes me think of Levi-Strauss, who was so interested in
how the anthropologist looking at the native culture
distorts it -- even changes it forever -- merely by
looking. Like, there's the impulse and the manifestation;
the manifestation embeds the impulse in a culture; the
culture is what it is, i.e. "smash capitalism" in a
capitalist context ("Steal This Book") would be at least
partially a capitalist statement. Punk (not monolithically,
but frequently) played with pop as a ground for productive
contradictions ("this is radio clash on pirate
satellite / orbiting your living room, cashing in the
bill of rights").

Because they're still just about the most relevant thing around -
the problem's when it is nostalgia, and impresent - reminded of Serres'
on Lucretius - treating L. as contemporary, not as misrecognition or
historicism - or rather creating a deliberate misrecognition of both
historicism and historiography in the instance - Alan

"Because they're still just about the most relevant thing around -"

--give me a break, man. i'm sorry, but no. when i called a friend day before
christmas even, and the first thing out of her mouth was "have you heard the
bad news" i was prepared for something really awful, & personal, and then
she said "joe strummer died" (which I already knew cause i'd been driving
around all freakin day doin last minute pre-christmas things) I said "Oh,
yeh" relieved that it WASN'T a personal tragedy and somewhat ANGRY that
she'd amped up the drama just to tell me that.

while i agree that -- and having watched the dylan documentary "don't look
back" just last week -- there have been far too few politically relevant
entertainers in the past 25 years, i cant bring myself to get too worked up
about mr. strummer, especially considering that he hasn't been much heard
from over the past 10 yrs, not like peter kowald who died at similar age and
circumstances but was tremendously active right up to time of death last
fall.

i'm far more broken up about the death of my beloved cat, jefe, hit by a car
a couple weeks ago. sorry. if you want to start a looonnng thread about
that...

I triumph over the beasts. I slay them with guns, bombs, gas, even my own
bare hands. I deprive them of privacy and sleep. I starve them out of their
caves. I mock their customs and defile their secrets. I beat them to confess
until the words flow like blood. And yet they keep coming back.

Such stupid creatures! Why can't they see that I am the civilized one, the
one who will prevail with my superior strength? Not even if they join forces
with the devil himself will they win. I have faced down great evil before,
and I can do it again. Even if I have to borrow a page or two from the book
of hell itself.

This is my America, in the year 2002. But where is the snow we played in
before the tumbling of the towers? I fear it has all melted away.

Oh yeah? I couldnt keep straight who were the Clash, the Cars or the Police.
I could always tell when it was Charles Tyler, though.

From CNN, 12/26/02:

What music stars are the new punks?

By Tom Sinclair
Entertainment Weekly
Thursday, December 26, 2002 Posted: 2:59 PM EST (1959 GMT)

You little devil: Jacko's wacko behavior? SO punk rock.
=20
(Entertainment Weekly) -- For anyone who remembers the golden era of punk -=
-
roughly 1976-1979 -- it's got to be slightly disconcerting to see what punk
has become. Let's face it: The happy-face,
let's-all-jump-around-and-act-silly music of acts like Sum 41 and blink-182
seems pretty lightweight when stacked up against that of the Sex Pistols or
the Dead Boys.=20

Punk rock was all about deviance and transgression; it was music made by an=
d
for malcontents and screw-ups. Sure, the Ramones sounded poppy, but their
music was informed by real pain -- those songs about sniffing glue and
zoning out in mental hospitals were based on the band's real-life
experiences. "People who join a band like the Ramones don't come from stabl=
e
backgrounds,'' wrote the late Dee Dee Ramone in his autobiography
''Lobotomy: Surviving the Ramones.''

By contrast, the new wave of sanitized, parent-approved Top 40 punk rockers
seem like All-American kids.

So where's a person seeking authentic latter-day punk role models to turn?
Well, the most outrageous punk attitude actually seems to be emanating from
folks who no one would ordinarily think about labeling punk.

Take Whitney ''Crack Is Cheap'' Houston. For the past few years, we've
watched her get skinnier and twitchier than dead Dead Boy Stiv Bators as
rumors swirled that she was caught in a whirlpool of destructive drug use.
Then came her jaw-dropping performance with Diane Sawyer on national
television, in which a blas=E9 Whitney copped to drug use while flaunting a
defiantly unapologetic attitude about her erstwhile ''partying'' lifestyle.
Now that's punk.=20

Let's look at another multi-platinum diva. After exhibiting increasingly
erratic behavior, Mariah Carey had a very public breakdown and was
hospitalized. When she reemerged, it was with an album of almost completely
unlistenable music. Hey, that's even more punk than if she had recorded
versions of the Ramones' ''Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment'' and ''Bad Brain.''

And check out Michael Jackson.

The dude has been going out of his way to antagonize his record company and
its chief, Tommy Mottola, even though the facts prove that Jackson is almos=
t
totally in the wrong. Fighting unwinnable battles -- not to mention making =
a
laughing stock of yourself -- has long been a hallmark of the punk
aesthetic.=20

And just look at Mike's face: The damage he's inflicted on his visage is fa=
r
more extreme than anything old-school punks accomplished with the aid of
makeup or safety pins through their cheeks -- and he paid to have it done!
Plus, he almost dropped his kid off a balcony recently. How punk is that?

And let's not forget Christina ''Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More''
Aguilera, who seems to be trying to outdo the Plasmatics' Wendy O. Williams=
,
Courtney Love, and the Runaways combined in the
let's-pretend-we're-slutty-teen-hookers sweepstakes. Public reaction to her
new image already rivals the shock and repulsion of the British when the Se=
x
Pistols cussed up a storm on the U.K.'s ''Today Show.'' That spells P-U-N-K
in our book.=20

Think you know what constitutes punk? Get hip to the real junk. Just
remember: In this strange new age, punk attitude can be found anywhere --
even atop the Billboard charts.

...I started getting phone calls from all these slick magazine journalists
who wanted to know about this new phenomenon called "punk rock." I was a
litt bit confused at first, because as far as I was concerned punk rock was
something which had first raised its grimy snout around 1966 in groups like
the Seeds and Count Five and was dead and buried after the Stooges broke up
and the Dictators' first LP bombed.

I mean, it's easy to forget that just a little over a year ago there was
ONLY ONE THING: the first Ramones album.

But who could have predicted that that record would have such an
impact--all it took was that and the ferocious edge of the Sex Pistols'
"Anarchy in the UK," and suddenly it was as if someone had unleashed the
floodgates as ten milion little groups all over the world came storming in,
mashing up the residents with their guitars and yammering discontented non
sequiturs about how bored and fed up they were with everything.

Punk had repeated the very attitudes it copped (BOREDOME and INDIFFERENCE),
and we were all waiting for a group to come along who at least went through
the motions of GIVING A DAMN about SOMETHING.

Ergo, the Clash.


I would like to make a couple of things perfectly clear:
1. I do not know shit about the English class system
2. I do not care shit about the Englsh class system.

I've heard about it, understand. I've hear it has something to do with why
Rod Stewart now makes music for housewives, and why Peter Townshend is so
screwed up. I guess it also has something to do with another NME writer
sneering to me, "Joe Strummer has a fucking middle class education, man!" I
surmise further that this is supposed to indicate that he isn't worth a
shit, and that his songs are all fake street-graffiti. Which is fine by me:
Joe Stummer is a fake. That only puts him in there with Dylan and Jagger
and Townshend and most of the other great rock songwriters, because almost
all of them in one way or another were fakes. Townshend had a middle class
education. Lou Reed went to Syracuse University before matriculating to the
sidewalks of New York. Dylan faked his whole career; the only difference
was that he used to be good at it and now he sucks.

The point is that, like Richard Hell says, rock n roll is an arena in which
you recreate yourself and all this blathering about authenticity is just a
bunch of crap. The Clash are authentic because their music carried such a
brutal conviction, not because they're Noble Savages.

The Clash were a bit of a disappointment the first night. They played well,
everything was in the right place, but the show seemed to lack energy. ...
Back up in the dressing room I cracked, "Duff gig, eh fellas?" and they
laughed, but you could thell that they didn't think it was funny. Later I
found out that Joe Strummer had an abscessed tooth which had turned into
glandular fever, and since the rest of the band draw their energy off him
they were all suffering. By rights he should have taken a week off and
headed straight for the nearest hospital, but he refused to cancel any
gigs, no mere gesture of integrity.

A process of escalating admiration for this band had begun for me which was
to continue until it broached something like awe. See, because it's easy to
SING about your righteous politics, but as we all know actions speak louder
than words, and the Clash are one of the very few examples I've seen where
they would rather set an example by their personal conduct than TALK about
it all day.

CAse in point. When we got back to their hotel I had a couple of
interesting lessons to learn. First thing was that they went up to their
rooms while Ellie, Pennie, a bunch of fans and I sat in the lobby. I began
to make with the grouch squawks because if there's one thing I've learned
to detest over the years it's sitting around some goddamn hotel lobby like
a soggy douchebag parasite waiting for some lousy high-and-mighty rock n
roll band to MAYBE DEIGN to put in an imperial appearance.

But then a few minutes later the Clash came down and joined us and I
realized that unlike most bands I'd ever met they weren't stuck up, weren't
on a star trip, were in fact genuinely interested in meeting and gettign
acquainted with their fans one-on-one, noncondescending level.

...

Now, I don't know how much time you may have actually spent around bigtime
rock n roll bands -- you may not think so, but the less the luckier you ar
in most cases -- but let me assure you that the way the Clash treat their
fans falls so far outside the normal run of these things as to be outright
revolutionary. I'm going to say it and I'm going to say it slow: most
rockstars are goddamn pigs who have the usual burly corps of hired thugs to
keep the fans away from them at all costs, excepting the usual select
contingent of lucky (?) nubiles who they'll maybe deign to allow up to
their rooms for the privilege of sucking on their wangers, after which they
often as not they get pitched out into the street to find their way home
without even cabfare. The whole thing is sick to the marrow, and I simply
could not believe that any band, especially one as MUSICALLY brutal as the
Clash, could depart so far from this fetid norm.

I mentioned it to Mick, "I've just got to say that I really respect you...I
mean, I had no idea that any group could be as good to its fans as this..."

He just laughed, "Oh, so is that gonna be the hook for your story, then?"

And that for me is the essence of the Clash's greatness, over and beyond
the music, why I fell in love with them, why it isn't necessary to do any
boring interviews with them about politics or the class system or any of
that: because here at last is a band which not only preaches something good
but practices it as well, that instead of talking about changes in social
behavior puts the model of a truly egalitarian society into practice in
their own conduct.

The fact that Mick would make a joke out of it only shows how far they're
going towards the realization of all the hopes we ever had about rock n
roll as utopian dream--because if rock n roll is truly the democratic
artform, then the democracy has got to begin at home; that is, the
everlasting and totally disgusting walls between artists and audience must
come down, elitism must perish, the "stars" have got to be humanized,
demythologized, and the audience has got to be treated with more respect.
Otherwise it's all a shuck, a ripoff, and the music is as dead as the
Stones' and Led Zep's has become.

NOSTALGIA?
To my mind, few of the comments in the Clash/Strummer thread, which I've
just finished reading, are primarily motivated by nostalgia. A few of the
early notes quote lyrics, a gesture of inclusion I'd say. (Here, I'm also
responding tangentially to an earlier question--asking if listers even
knew/cared who Strummer was.) If a lister didn't know Strummer's work, s/he
could quickly have gotten a sense of it from the lyrics quoted by Behrle and
others. This is an important function of the listserv. Often I've been
introduced to a poet, painter, filmmaker, lyricist, etc. on this list. A few
times I've found invigorating, inspiring, challenging work this way.

Back to the Clash thread: I detected nostalgia only in the notes about going
to or not going to Clash concerts; however, such posts were both few in
number and quite short. No harm I'd say. (I'd also argue that these very
personal responses to a public figure's passing can be valuable to listers
who were not *around at the time* since they give us a sense of the scene, a
kind of social history via memoir. I also value the personal, idiosyncratic
(sometimes nostalgic) accounts of readings, conference, meetings,
performances, etc. that I find on this list.)

Though I was not on this listserv at the time, I'd imagine such *nostalgia*
also characterized some of the posts that appeared when Allen Ginsberg died:
"I did/did not go hear him read in x year in x place when I was age x ..."
However, I'd also imagine that the Ginsberg thread, like this one, was not
primarily nostalgic. Most listers, I'm sure, quoted poems; wrote personal
notes about his importance to them; argued about his influence, politics,
and quality as a poet, etc. I'd also imagine that no one asked "Why is it
that one of the longest threads here is about nostalgia for a poet that was
popular in one's adolescence?” Or maybe someone did.

BEYOND “ONE’S ADOLESCENCE”
I’d also like to challenge the last part of George’s question. I'd venture
to say that for at least a handful of the participants in the thread (and
for some interested readers of the thread), the Clash were *not* "a band
popular in one's adolescence." In my case the Clash had long since (at least
"long" in pop music terms) ceased to exist by the time I reached
adolescence. Folks like me discovered the Clash long after the band’s
buzz-days. Strummer and Jones' manner of handling, say, consumerism...with a
sometimes volatile, sometimes sentimental (some may argue w/ me on this
point) mix of satire and sincerity (the songs “Koka Kola” and “Lost in the
Supermarket” come to mind) are, if anything, more relevant now than they
were when written in the late 70s. Then there’s the catalog of urban imagery
that could be compared to, say, Blake’s “London”. Then there are the
crosscultural musical influences already mentioned in this thread. These and
other aspects of the band have influenced &/or inspired the work of many
poets & perhaps more importantly can be fruitfully compared (although no
line of influence or inspiration may exist) to the work of many others. (Dan
Bouchard's poetry comes immediately to mind.) Consumerism and postmodern
imperialism cast a long shadow these days & the Clash’s critiques of these
phenomena remain relevant because their songs (despite their limitations)
delve into & partake of the inherent contradictions & complexities of the
issues, and are not limited to sloganeering as are so many examples of
“social realist” pop, punk, and poetry.



Lets have some readings of Clash (and other "punk") songs (both lyrics and
music, since I believe the Clash's crosscultural musical influences can be
*read* too). I'd also invite others to write about poets whose work can be
read in terms of various *punk* musics and/or aesthetics.

(Clash lyrics can be found here
http://www.punkbands.com/lyrics/bands/clash/index.htm
and elsewhere.)

MUSIC ON THE POETICS LIST
The thread is really not all that dissimilar from the Lomax thread earlier
this year. Initially reports of his death were sent in, then obituaries &
hagiography, then criticism, then...well I don't remember what followed well
enough to characterize it, so I'll let it be. Was that also nostalgia for
"one's" adolescence or youth?

Lomax, for good or ill, is an important figure for many members of the
listserv. The use of, appropriation of, reimagining of *folk* materials is a
project in which many of us are engaged. & so Lomax is a relevant figure &
it was appropriate for poets to mark his passing w/ discussion of his life's
work. What’s wrong then w/ listers commenting on the Clash’s use of, say,
Caribbean musical styles, or their complicated relationship to commerce and
radical politics, etc. These issues (both found in recent listnotes) are
certainly relevant to the poetry many members of the listserv read and
write.

I’m also reminded of the way in which Geoff Ward takes Harry Smith's folk
anthology seriously as *literature* in his book _The Writing of America_,
though I don’t have the time just now to draw parallels between cultural
hybridity in Smith's anthology & cultural hybridity in much of the best(?)
music that has come after the anthology’s appearance. Nor am I able, just
now, to argue—as I think Eliot Weinberger does somewhere in _Written
Reaction_—-that hybridity (through, for example, translation) has also been
the lifeblood of much of the best(?) post-ww2 poetry, but is lacking in
contemporary, workshop-centered and/or poet-prof centered poetic practice.
When I think of Strummer/The Clash these are the issues that spring to mind
for me and, I think, for other listers as well, though they perhaps, like
me, do not have the time to spell all that out & instead are able only to
steal a few moments from work to quote lyrics (!!!) or rehash old punk
politics that are relevant to this list’s perennial interest in indie
commerce, authenticity, and who’s-more-radical-than-whom. This gets me to
how I (and many others) use this list: usually what is sd in a thread is far
less useful to me than the in-the-flesh conversations that are inspired by
what transpires here; list arguments, nay-saying, & the like are also less
meaningful, ultimately, than the poems (and music and films, etc.) that
various threads have pointed me towards.

Is Reading Milton Unsafe at Any Speed?

December 28, 2002
By D. D. GUTTENPLAN




An article in The Times Literary Supplement of London argues
that John Milton's verse play "Samson Agonistes" is "an
incitement to terrorism."

The convergence of the Milton and Pepys literary currents in my inbox this
A.M. has set my mind racing in weird directions that mught be food for
thought for some.

If Pepys was not reflective and self-conscious this might be what gives me
pause in blogging (2 negs)and has led to my abandoning or jettisoning all
attempts at diarying: revelations of the self are not always comfort food.

Milton had the grace to portray his demons as literature rather than as a
bomb and this might with luck be seen as an enduring legacy of 'modernism'
and liberalism.  This might be a romantic vision of my past but I do recall
making a personal decision like this in the late sixties even though no
'Samson Agonistes' resulted from this decision.

As a side note, I do think it's relevant to the argument that Samson was
blind and perhaps blind as well to the suffering of others.

This has been just about the best answer to my question so far. I am still,
of course, an unreconstructed old fart who is puzzled by the idea of poetry
influenced by rock and roll instead of jazz. GB

A new translation of Darwish's poetry has been
published by the University of California Press. It
includes a generous selection of his work from the
eighties and nineties and what seems to be the
entirety of his most recent book, "Mural"--

It's beautiful and I hope you all will consider
ordering it for your personal use, but particularly,
if you are organizationally affiliated, for your
libraries or course use. Darwish is an immense poet,

Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, Just Dropped In
To See What Condition My Condition Was In 1.
kari edwards

         -or what position my position is in, or how to position my =
position=20
machine, or how to consider situating without signifying, or maybe how=20=

to place another without them becoming a commodity.

        there is this phenomena in this (queer) community (is there a=20
community that I do not know about?) that creates an insurable hunger=20
to situate and name, to volley up to the Act Up power bar with (wall=20
streetish) slogans like =93SILENCE=3DDEATH,=94 or the universal =93I am =
queer=20
and I am proud,=94 or "I=92m proudly queer," or... =93gay power=94.... =
all good=20
at creating an identity and a situation that becomes a media campaign,=20=

with sideorder products and glossy magazines, to be pierced/ perceived=20=

and tattooed. We have queer or (reallY) GAY & LESBIAN =91getaways=92 =
what=20
are we getting away from may be a bigger question? what are we being or=20=

what are we living in that makes it necessary to get away? we create=20
the multiplicity of multiple positions and multiple tracking systems to=20=

situate the multiple positions to a singularity with a few hand picked=20=

letters from the alphabet, then we create dramatic discourses on each=20
letter. no wonder there's a need for holiday getaways..
=09
        by now you have realized this is not your typical academic =
paper. are=20
we to assume one mode fits all with within academic dioramas, or is it=20=

one size will get you by as the standard for excellence in scholarly=20
production units? What is it to exclude types of writing, or limit=20
inclusion of certain types into journals? more of the same, a time=20
magazine for queers? oh that's right we already have those...

        this is not some universal absolute doctrine to rally the troops=20=

around and march to a future tense perfection written all over our=20
utopian dreamscape, or some miracle to bring about greater acceptance=20
by those others in the alphabet soup... (the can of soup I am a part of=20=

but not sure I want to join). this is a question and proposition. what=20=

are we doing here by trying to bring in more and more discussions=20
around "bi" and "trans"? what does it truly accomplish? is it a further=20=

exercise in creating a defense against the oppression, against=20
heteronormative  perspectives, all the while reinforcing that=20
perspective? why are we not talking of ways of disrupting this=20
codification economy,  instead of further situating already oppressed=20
groups?

        one of the questions ought to be, is; what is it when there is =
an act=20
of piracy by the privileged using academic writing within a logocentric=20=

context, to speak of or about queers or =93bi=94 or =93trans=94 issues =
and or=20
individuals? inherently this seems like a problem, situating those who=20=

have already been doubly situated by the medical, psychological, and=20
academic community with further discourse; as if we could write=20
ourselves out of this economy with the speech that created the=20
situation in the first place. this is not to say critical theory and a=20=

deconstruction of social lies are not beneficial, but I do think there=20=

has to be a critic of the critics. without a diversity of voices it=20
becomes a monotone of resistance and an act of doubly situating the=20
already multiply signified.

no one has ever written, painted, sculpted, modeled, built, or invented=20=

except literally to get out of hell.2.

questions:
1. whose writing are we using to get out of hell?
2. have we forgotten Audre Lordre=92s provocative statement: =93The=20
master=92s tools will never dismantle the master=92s house.3.=94?

what is not the master=92s tongue, tool, sword, and or gun?

        Allen Ginsberg=92s - Howl, Anne Waldman=92s - Fast Speaking =
Woman, Leslie=20
Fineberg=92s - Stone Butch Blues, Radcylffe Hall=92s - The Well of=20
Loneliness, Rachel Blau Duplesissis - Drafts, Eileen Myles - Maxfield=20
Parish, use either poetic or fictional positioning /nonpositioning,=20
with at least mild disruption of the father tongue through content or=20
major disruption of syntax. without theory, these text have been the=20
rally point of a queer community in different times and different=20
spaces. would it not make sense then to give these texts equal weight=20
in the discourse? The problem is these text tend to be more=20
phenomenological and less analytical, so there is no measuring stick to=20=

judge them by, but isn't that the point?

        yet even this partial list is segregated when it comes to the =
types of=20
writing accepted by academia, which does nothing but create a hierarchy=20=

of one text form over another, institutionalizing a certain privilege=20
for those that can afford a certain type of education, or privileges of=20=

a certain type of speaking.....

        enough!!

        is it not the content and expression we should be worried about =
. . .=20
not the form it takes? isn't that the whole question; what form are=20
you? should we not hear the mode of expression of ones being, or the=20
content that one carries to the moment?

        so how does this relate to a transgender/bisexual=20
intersections/conception or conscription? it is important to stay on=20
track, be reproducible, predictable, same time every time, part of the=20=

assembly line, a repetitive pattern, to be seen and read, punch the=20
clock, life in a cube, and transport our bodies in sheltered=20
environments whereever we go...

        and I desire rights . . . the right to not be a thing.

        in a society where no one is any longer            recognizable =
by=20
anyone else, each individual                     is necessarily unable=20=

to recognize his (sic) own reality 4.

        the option then is to be super-situated, super-signified with =
special=20
laws to protect us from the gross inequities of this society. even then=20=

we are not recognizable to each other, and passing becomes of yearning=20=

hunger of privilege.  yet, we want to be seen, so we create a special=20
day where we are all together, even then we are invisible... so we try=20=

harder, be more of that which is thought to be our own unique position,=20=

that that is shared by a thousand others with labels like "trans" and=20
"bi"...I am this, I am special... look at me, feel me, touch me . . . I=20=

am not you, but I am in your parade . . . you have to accept me now.

        that will not happen, or who cares if it happens, or it will =
happen in=20
time . . . . time I do not have. I am a stranger in my own land, but=20
that's fine. I do not want to be a contributing member of the GNP . . .=20=

we have to stop situating and create a potential future.  Krishnamurti=20=

said; =93the future is now=94 5., yet we have this desire to =
conceptualize=20
the past/present, instead of future/present.

        so, one of the questions is what does the life of someone who is=20=

"trans" or "bi" have to do with politics? as Kate Bornstein said so=20
beautifully during one of the many times I have seen Kate perform,=20
=93there are not words that can describe me=94 . . . or something like =
that=20
. . . (if I damaged the flow Kate I do apologize) . . . but the deeper=20=

I go into the understanding of language and social construction the=20
further away I get from a need for an inevitable body, or a=20
recognizable figure or a situated constraint. I say we open our bodies=20=

to desire without language, eroticize without shame.

        and what is the meaning of the words "trans" and "bi" when it =
emanates=20
from a bankrupt system bent on violence and subjugation?

        yes, it=92s true, I identify with those "trans" individuals =
brutally=20
murdered. I also identify with those in bosnia, afghanistan, united=20
states of amerika and where ever individuals are denied their freedom=20
of desire and are forced by violence to conform...

        does this mean I try to pass and fit in? . . . hardly . . . I am =
not a=20
thing, or I am everything. I am never a thing, but a verb, that works=20
and lives to do what I can to protect others against the silent=20
violence of the state, such as naming, time, and product placement..

        let=92s face it, any definition does harm . . . instead of =
speaking of=20
this or that, who cares if you are "bi" and you a truck driver, and/or=20=

what that means? or if you are "trans," can you wear other things? the=20=

problems we are facing are so much bigger than what kind of doll does a=20=

"bi" (person) pick, as compared to a "trans" (person). we have only=20
disconnected islands of natural forests left, the oceans levels are=20
rising and threatening indigenous people on the islands in the pacific.=20=

we are in the middle of a world sports match with live weapons, loosing=20=

rights left and right, increasingly told to buy more, spend more, be=20
patriotic, which is an evil unto itself. this is a nation of excess;=20
ten billion hamburgers sold daily and we are worrying about what kind=20
of vibrator "trans" and "bi" people choose . . . this is a world in=20
crisis, and yes, it includes violent discrimination against those who=20
do not pass the state sponsored car buying and baby making test . . .=20
hundreds of those that use labels to protect themselves are murdered=20
each year . . . so there are bigger questions . . . why are we allowing=20=

murder in the name of the state? why do we continue to believe in the=20
failed fairy tale of definitional idenity as an answer, when all that=20
happens is the reinforment of the other?

        we need to consider that even in the name of progress, =
signifying=20
through discourse is based on knowledge, which is equal to power. so=20
the question then is who is discussing what for whom? I do not need any=20=

one describing for me my general sense of the world and reiterating=20
through repetition what may or may not be my world view. I need a=20
personal fiction that sings like poetry and is crossdressed in the=20
night. I need creative writing that becomes philosophical drag in an=20

constantly situate as a thing.

Thnaks, but I looked up the song institutionalized by ST and found the
following lyrics on the 'net but don't see anything about a pepsi-

12. Institutionalized

So you're gonna be institutionalized
You'll come out brainwashed with bloodshot eyes
You won't have any say
They'll brainwash you until you see their way

They stuck me in an institution
Said it was the only solution
To give me the needed professional help
To protect me from the enemy, myself

They give you a white shirt with long sleeves
Tied around your back you're treated like thieves
Drug you up because they're lazy
It's too much work to help a crazy

They say they're gonna fix my brain
Alleviate my suffering and my pain
But by the time they fix my head
Mentally I'll be dead

How do you think these politics and limits of bi/trans physical social

you think that they do at all?)  or is that irrelevant to your discussion?

Looking for truth


"The Baal Shem said: 'What does it mean, when people say that Truth goes
over all the world? It means that Truth is driven out of one place after
another, and must wander on and on.'" (Martin Buber)
Nous sont tres fatiguee sur le pont avec la plume de ma tant.
Nous avons trois souris, aveugles, desoeuvres!
Frere Jacques, ou sont les armes cireux?
Dansez et dormez sur les rues triestes et courir rapid!
Ou sont les cadvres? Marguerite! Marguerite!
Monsieur, la automobile nous mise a mort aujourd'hui!
Medecin, medecine! Nous tombes au-dessous de pont de fer!
Un avion de transport vol au dessus des coureurs qui danses.
Amenez tole; tant etalons! - Etalez - ils vens!
Frottez, ou frisson, ou froisson - frole la question ...
Un tort est une honte ...
"Symbolic function is incorporated by certain molecules only in the
context of specific neural systems in which the molecules are elaborated."
(Ira B. Black)
Cherchez la verite.

that's just the chorus...

here's the section from the song...

I was sitting in my room, and I was like staring at the walls thinking about
everything but then again I was thinking about nothing, and then my mom came
in and I didn't notice she was there and she calls my name and I didn't hear
her and then she started screaming:
- Mike, Mike!
And I go:
- What, what's the matter?
She goes:
- What's the matter with you?
I say:
- Nothing mom.
She goes:
- Don't tell me nothing, you're on drugs!
I go:
- No mom, I'm not on drugs, I'm ok, I'm just thinking, you know, why don't
you get me a Pepsi?
She goes:
- No, you're on drugs, you're crazy, normal people won't be acting that way!
I go:
- Mom, I'm all right, I'm just thinking, you know, so why don't you, like
give me a Pepsi?
And she goes:
- No, you're crazy!
All I wanted was a Pepsi, just one Pepsi, and she wouldn't give it to me,
just one Pepsi.


this, though is a slight variation of the one from their first cd in
'83...this was the version released on _Still Cyco After All These Years_ in
the mid 90's (?)...a kind of 'greatest hits'...

There's a full theatricalized (stage reading)
production of ~Samson Agonistes~ being done as a play
with actors (please teach me to write your English
language) this spring at the 92nd Street Y, in
Manhattan (New York): March 10, 2003 (the 92nd Street
Y, for you English-speaking out-of-towners, is not a
full Village People-style YMCA with men in towels
leaving the doors to their cubicles open) [note,
above: town/towel. Give me a GRADE on my English
talk!] nor knotting towel at hip; it's a reading
series type emporium (as in American slang!).  Among
the actors (-tresses): Claire Bloom (presumably in the
role of Delilah).

(2)

Does anyone know who the 19 Subpress collective
sponsors are, who donate 1% of their income to the
funding of Subpress?

Carol Mirakove is one.

Thnaks.

>From first to last, Jennifer was unable to face the vacancy that pursued
her every step of the way. She felt old and used. She was beginning to
resent Nikuko, and looked for a new Clar. She wanted either war or sex; it
didn't matter. She was human after all. It was a world without men! It was
a world without anything! It was Dangerous-Toy world, and she was on top.
She lay back down to sleep. She never dreamed. The Clar came in with a
question. Jennifer woke with a start. You am your new Clar, she asked,
already knowing the answer. Nikuko would have been shredded; she suspected
nothing. One or the other had to go. War and love in a huge blend, hating
the enemy enough to kill her. She put on her new Clar. She could hear
Nikuko in the distance, begging, begging... What could she do? The
shredder existed beneath the bleak sky of the dome, to one rococo
elliptical center; Jennifer was at the other. It was emptied otherwise.
She loved the begging sounds, the tormented cries and murmurs of the
wounded. Humans mewled in orgasm and death, she mused. I shredded first;
I'm still here, the new Clar unformed, ungrown, at your mercy. Hello, I
are the new Clar. I are at Jennifer's mercy. She keeps me naked and bound;
she gives me a gun. I kill on command but only on command. I are available
to her at any time. I don't have to think for myself. The old Clar has
gone; the screams am dying out. Each bit of tissue cries on its own. They
am dying, one after the other, hundreds and thousands. Hello, I are the
new Clar, Jennifer. The new Clar was breathing deep into Jennifer's holes.
Jennifer was expanding; eyes closed, in ecstasy, she would fill the
universe, break the dome, begin another. The cycle worked because of her
quick draw and politeness. The new Clar would be named Nikuko. She liked
the name and decided to continue it. Nikuko never returned, but Jennifer
mused, there is always a new Clar. The Clar, now Nikuko, was breathing
mindfully. Jennifer was totally at peace; every inch of her body alive
with passion, ecstasy, bravery and fury at the thought of war. Jennifer
was known far and wide for starting the marvel-war. She began and finished
the marvel-war and everyone would die again and again. Jennifer's legs
were spread and her mouth was open. There was a huge man in the sky
writing everything down. He was warrior-man, holding Jennifer with jealous
tenacity. Jennifer did not mind, because she was busy with her marvel-war
and new Clar. The man was shameful watching everything. Time and time
again he would see the Clar shredded, the new Clar coming. He was bound in
chains to an enormous rock. Something pecked at him every thousand years
and the rock would wear down only with eternity when he would be rescued
by the knight. Jennifer was much more alive and had things to do. She was
wayward and shameless and the new Clar cleared out the debris of the
marvel-war. The new Clar asked Jennifer what else to do, but Jennifer had
returned to sleep. Jennifer never dreamed, and was not dreaming now. The
new Clar was called Nikuko and when Jennifer stirred, she asked Nikuko not
to begin the derail-war and specifically not to begin the deflect-war, and
the new Clar agreed and they did return and the mewling had stopped. They
waved their arms furiously in a dance of epiphany and the man was losing
his liver. His liver began to grow. They never spoke to each other and she
never looked at him because she did not know his language. The new Clar
waved her arms more and more and then waved Jennifer's arms. Jennifer
waved the new Clar's arms, which were called the arms of Nikuko. Jennifer
had a bright and shiny smile. Her Clar loved her smile. Her new Clar would
smile when she would smile. Sometimes her new Clar would smile on her own.
Her new Clar was called Nikuko. Sometimes they were at war. Sometimes they
made sexual and non-sexual love.

They made many kinds of war. There was only one Clar, the new Clar. She
was Jennifer's addition. Jennifer was her addition. The tissues from the
shredding machine were very silent. Nikuko did not hear a thing, and
either did Jennifer. The new Clar made many kinds of love. The warrior-man

evening star/And one clear call for me!/O Captain my Captain!/Getting and=20
spending, we lay waste our powers/I'm nobody!Who are you?

These fragments were put there by my mother, who can recite, by heart,=20
pages and pages of verse by Tennyson, Milton, Wordsworth, Longfellow and=20
Dickinson. On occasion, I can manage to recite the poems that contribute to=
=20
my voice-over poem in their entirety. My mother =97 whose voice (like the=20
sound of waves, a kind of sea of words) is one of my earliest memories, my=
=20
first sense of consciousness and language =97 gave me this gift.

Damain,

I do agree, and I think it is a more in depth question/answer then how
I responded. yes I agree, some instructors are wonderfully radical and
bring a lot to the surface...but there is a general cannon (interesting
term) and if  one bumps up against it especially getting a ph.d , or if
instructor is threaten by a students achievement,  or  if a faculty is
just sliding by, all of which I have seen happen to students there can
be a discounting of that students work.  there is also a tendency to
say within the lines. In most case you can not turn in a doctoral
thesis in poetic prose.. why.. its the law... you can not do a
lot...why . .  its the law...or sort of.. it must be acknowledge for
the most part with students there is  transference  issues, and most
students do not question the "law"..

now , I am not saying this happens at every school, but there is a
herirechy of education. this student I mentioned was from a local
school (close to there home- outside the metro area), does outside
metro areas mean less radical in some cases, not always.  and there is
a lot that could be said about locations of school and the faculty
there. this is not to say they are not good,  but I do think there is a
tendency to be more conservative... my experience just mine.. mind
you...again as you said it depends on the school..

but  in gender studies  to leave out some of the major writers... and
Judith Butler is hardly radical...maybe 10 years ago.. well again I
will reiterate, if there is not a full range of discourse in education
to the point where students can challenge the educational system and
given constructs, is the job being done?

And what does it mean to be a fully-realized professional ...I would
question the term itself as a misnomer of sorts..as if there is a state
to go.. or a place to be, or a standard to be able to stratify.. again
that would be what i was talking about.. I think some of the most fully
realized professionals have been some of the most dangerous... there is
no standard.. standers are power...

sorry to be ranting.. not enough coffee..
oh... standards become habits  which become power and create
hierarchies of right and wrongs

its a small k in kari not  a large K

peace.

To mark the passing of 2002, the last blog on poetry:

http://pantaloons.blogspot.com

Two days of entries on Peter Ganick, including his own notes from 2001 and
from Dec 29, 2002 on the writing of "tend.field."

From Nada Gordon, a cryptic "you funny" and a few other syllables.

The ear discussion, brought up on other blogs, gets advanced thru
consideration of "the splanchnic" as well as "schizogenous chemicals." Also,
there's something about how list-making gets calculated.

Among name-drops: those with the following letters: Mina, James (Jimmy), R.,
Brandon, Lisa, Lee Ann, W, Ed, Wan.

You're invited to enter and e-mail on poetry in/as response.

Now we spit such vein-ink, thoughtless,

with emissions. One would think
in this weather of sabres and
ruminations clutched dead-

at least William Carlos Williams would
think that thumb-muddied missionaries

I recieved this too and went to their site to have a look. Its not the
batter-dipped poetry of poetry.com but much more greasy, like last night's
donut. Not relevant really, but I admire how they spam :-)

Best, Geoffrey

I find this email a little bit like being touched on the back by a seemingly
friendly stranger who introduces himself as x and you realize he is the
ex-husband of your new girl friend.
Of course, you want none of him or it and disappear as quickly as possible.

The muse of deception would naturally be hard at work during the holidays!

There is the book "Lipstick Traces" by Greil Marcus which attempts to draw
together punk and dada, the Letterist, May '68 Paris, the Situationists,
various killing sprees, the Gnostics, turns of culture wherein what is most
despised assumes the throne of culture, or something heavy sounding like
that. The shout, "I am nothing when I should be everything!" (I think
Language Poetry receives a few mentions.)

Is there a relation between Punk & writing? Is the frame of: "anybody can d=
o
it", "DIY", "let's write/fuck writing", transgressions both of content and
form, de-commercializing the product-- sound slogan enough to somehow
account for a relation between the two?

These traditions existed in art communities, but not, to my knowledge, in
music movements. And many of us were young enough then, when that music
mattered, to have cared.

At a lecture he was giving in SF several years ago, I asked the artist Vito
Acconci what music he liked, and dropped the name Xenakis for some reason
that escapes me now. Acconci said that he preferred The Clash, which I think
makes sense. Both he and The Clash engage in making rather crudely hewn (by
intent) political statements through a form of agit-prop art, although I
think Acconci is vastly superior in his aims and results. Acconci was an
interesting poet for a while until he saw his first Jasper Johns painting,
from which he concluded that poetry was several decades behind the times and
so gave it up. Acconci still uses texts in his work that I find quite poetic
(mainly evocative of people like Beckett) and frankly more interesting than
most modern poetry. Even now, I myself tend to see today's poetry as
somewhat lagging in relation to the other arts. I mean, would the visual
arts give a moment's notice to a neo-surrealist like Ashbery?[*] I think
not. (Although the recent spate of neo-expressionism was pretty awful in its
own right. I guess all the arts are hurting for fresh ideas right now.)

[*] And I say this as a lover of Ashbery's work. - And knowing full well
that it is far more than over-fluffy surrealistic pillows he is offering us
for our dreams.

critiques of contemporary culture and spiritual commentary leavened with =
sharp wit. The cover design is by Stuart Henley, of the UH Department of =
Art. $12 from Subpress.

Sista Tongue, by Lisa Linn Kanae, is Tinfish's best-selling chapbook =
ever. Kanae has written an absorbing memoir/academic essay about growing =
up a pidgin speaker in Hawai`i. She makes parallels between the ways =
pidgin speakers and children with "speech defects" are treated. A highly =
informative and touching book. Designed by Kristin Gonzales. $10 from =
Tinfish Press.

3 Vietnamese Poets, translated by Linh Dinh, with an introduction by the =
translator. A wonderful sampling of work by contemporary poets writing =
in Vietnamese. A strangely under-achieving seller on our list, but well =
worth the $9. The poetry and design rock! Designed by Stuart Henley. =
From Tinfish.

Hamburger, by Steve Carll, is a chapbook that comes inside a foil =
wrapper. A series of scathing and witty poems about meat, in a meaty =
package. Our most fondled piece of work. Designed by Anne Sakutori, $5 =
from Tinfish.

Piece of Work is Murray Edmond's homage both to his mother and to the =
20th century history of New Zealand. Edmond is not well known in the =
United States, but his poetry is among the best being written in New =
Zealand. He is also a dramaturge and teacher at the University of =
Auckland. Designed by Ken Lincoln. $7 from Tinfish.

Clutch and Hockey Love Letters, by Sawako Nakayasu, include poems about =
hockey, about gender, about love, designed exquisitely by Jung Kim. $7 =
from Tinfish.

Living Pidgin: Contemplations on Pidgin Culture is Lee Tonouchi's =
collected critical works on his life and work as "da pidgin guerrilla." =
Includes talks, essays, and concrete poems. "Standard english to me is =
to me like jumbo shrimp and military intelligence, one oxymoron, cuz we =
know from everyday experience dat english is not really standard-ees =
just our artificial attempt to classify-fo` attach order to dat which =
cannot be ordered." A must read for anyone interested in language, =
Hawai`i's culture, or who simply wants wit with wisdom. $10 from =
Tinfish.

Tinfish 12 features work by writers from Hawai`I, New Zealand, =
Australia, and the west coast of the American continent. Cover designed =
back to front by Jung Kim; insides by Stuart Henley. $8 from Tinfish. =
Copies of Tinfish 11 are still available, with beautiful one of a kind =
covers by Chris Churchill.

Running a small press is an expensive business (or anti-business). The =
expenses are real, running in the thousands of dollars each year, and =
the gains less tangible. For that reason, we ask that you consider =
purchasing some Tinfish Press publications during this holiday season. =
Buy three publications directly from the press and get a fourth (less =
expensive) one free. Take a one day espresso fast and order even more. =
Each book bought and paid for gets us closer to the next good book. =
Please send this notice along to your friends.

Please write checks to Tinfish and send to Susan M. Schultz, 47-728 Hui =
Kelu Street #9, Kaneohe, HI 96744, or order through Ron Cox at Native =
Books (coxr@hawaii.edu). If you're not in the USA, the second option =
includes credit card access. Most titles can be found on amazon.com; =
please use them as a last resort.=20

I've felt that phenomenom: art in New Zealand is (for me as a relative
"outsider" to the art scene), or seems to be at times to me,  almost
endlessly inventive and when I think of art in the whole world I feel that
lit is always lagging and maybe music (or art) is or seems "ahead" of lit
and poetry: but I think its simply that those of us who practice lit and/or
poetry and the variants (and at certain points all the arts "high" and or
"low" as one sees them tend for me to conflate, or they can do): we are
almost too close to the subject we are thinking about or using. I think we -
and  I do include myself - tend to point to another art eg music as being
much more X -  where X is a quality that could actually be applied to
another art or arts or even activities: and I have heard musical people
discussing music (not so much punk or heavy rock or whatever or alternative
but sometimes they might be talking about jazz or "classical"  (which for
some people vaguely includes anything without a bouncy tune and a simple
song, so Bach who is NOT classical gets included...and Xenakis and
Stochausen and even Bartok would be noise if ever listened to)) who mention
poetry or the visual arts or even mathematics: but I think that regardless
of what we like in music or art, that phenomena of "the other side being
greener" recurs: its hard for us as practitioners to see the picture as well
as maybe others looking in and often they, in their turn,  miss certain
aspects we are cognisant of: critics also slide over to other arts making
great clains for what (whatever isnt their own art or specialty) is: but I
think it is wrong: new angles, new takes and also good and inventive usage
of more traditional forms are constantly being found. Talking of Ashbery:
asked in an interview what he regretted he said that it was not having
learnt how to compose music: the musician would hunger for the capacity to
fire and sing and modulate with words and might proceed to quote the way
words signal definite meanings for example....which is something as
practioners ...even if we are but mere "modernists" and lack the All
Encompassing  and Ubiquitous Sillimanic Wink...we may well be rather dubious
of.  I may be wrong on this however. Cheers, Richard.

Allen Ginsberg saw/made relations between punk & writing- in particular with The Clash. There are at least two available collaborations that I know of- "Capitol Air" on AG's HOLY SOUL JELLYROLL & "Ghetto Defendant" on The Clash's COMBAT ROCK.

Interesting note:

The voice of the Sandinistas, Daisy Zamora, wrote a great long poem, "Radio
Sandino." I had the good fortune to hear her read the poem, which took
approximately 25 minutes. When she was done with hit, I said to myself, now
I know where the Clash came up with their song.

The link to the Clash and Zamora? Ginsberg. I wrote Ginsberg once asking
him about the poem and the song, he, unfortunately, never got back to me...

with regard to effectivity--there are many more people who are aware of
the Clash's work than Acconci, who may well be caviar to the general, even
if his work is relatively.  if the object of making crude political
statements is to reach a mass audience, then the Clash were one of the
most successful makers of such messages ever.  That I understand Acconci
now has something to do with the fact that I got "Tommy Gun" when I was
thirteen.

the fact of the matter, though, is that, given the genre, the Clash were
rather sophisticated in presenting their politics.  especially on
Sandinista, their words almost seem ageless, which is virtually an
impossibility with explicitly referential political songs.  as a survivor
of any number of punk and hardcore anthems, I will say that crude is
hardly the word for the Clash.  and you should not underestimate their
attitude about stardom.  the Pistols were no precursors to straight edge,
being all about showing rock music to be a complete con.

RTyler, thanks for your wise -- but not wizened -- post on this topic. I
have nothing to add except a nod of the head across continents.

RCorbett, I take your point and largely concur. I confess that I have not
looked at the Clash's lyrics at all closely, although memory (possibly
faulty) informs me that the words to songs like London Calling are not the
most timeless I have ever heard: "phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust."
Oh, yeah, Beatlemania, that scourge of civilization, right up there with
Reagan's illegal mining of the Nicaragua harbors. But, oh, how Joe S sings
the line with SUCH conviction that you just gotta believe! Well, maybe not.
. .


I am so bad. Please don't spank me! It's all in the spirit of punk, okay?

I penned my missive about the Clash's continuing lyrical relevance and
then thought that perhaps my sentiment was having its way with my usually
unfailing clear-sightedness.  I probably could enumerate other lyrics of
theirs that now clunk, and we need not even discuss "Rock the Casbah."
As much I would hate to admit it, my interest in the Clash is very much
tied to having bought "Give 'Em Enough Rope" at an impressionable age.
"Phony Beatlemania has bitten the dust" probably sounds more dated to you,
than to me, though it also sounds like a wish rather than a prophecy.
But...two comments.

One is the fact that the Clash wrote virtually no relationship songs.  Or
when they did, it was in an undisguised attempt to have an American hit
single.  Train in Vain is a secret track, while Should I Stay or Should I
Go is bilingual.  They had a certain purity, which is what you might
expect from a band that wrote "Death or Glory."  Springsteen, by contrast
(and this is a contrast that always gets me in trouble, but here goes),
has any number of songs which betray (or mature from) his more rebellious
roots (but then the Boss is the kind of guy who puts it all out there).
Also, his politics are intuitive and sentimental--which is why "Born in
the USA" is not quite an anti-war song.  By contrast, the Clash often are
specific about who the buggers are and how they are buggering us, while
still offering a romantic swagger that distinguishes their work from a
policy paper by RCMP, as well as a too die for chorus ("Death or
Glory/Becomes another story.")  But the songs were never about
relationships.  This is stark--even the Sex Pistols wrote songs about sex.

The second point is related.  It's exactly the quality that Lester Bangs
pointed out, and he was in a much better position than me to speak of
their effect on the scene.  It's their purity--that they walked the walk
of punk being democratic and DIY.  That is really what is punk about
"punk."  It's not naming names and speaking truth to power, though that is
often a part of it.  It's not three chords and out (Television is the best
example.) It's saying that you don't have to buy the shite on the shelves,
that you could do it for yourself, and that you can be true to your
instincts.  This is what has Dischord and Fugazi going for now 20 years,
and Merge for over 10.   I hadn't thought until recently that the Clash,
who broke up a bit ugly, might have influenced it.  But they did, and
in comparison, Pearl Jam's battles with Ticketmaster seem kind of rock
star (though PJ has definitely hewed to their own path, in the way of
Springsteen and U2).  If you live in a city like Seattle, with live music
every night--much of it not that good, but much good--the Clash have a lot
to do with this.

kari, point taken; "fully realized" not the best locution
probably, since who ever is etc. I guess I was trying to
say that there's a stage at which one becomes accountable
for knowing the field, and not being ignorant of someone as
obvious as Butler; and that grad students may get to that
stage only late in the process. Far worse are the stories
I've heard of people who teach contemporary poetry and know
nothing of the avant side.

Something else I wanted to respond to is the idea that "in
most cases you cannot do a doctoral thesis in poetic
prose." In a sense this is a constraint -- there were days
before the rise of MFA programs when one could submit
creative work in lieu of criticism, at least at the MA
level (probably not doctoral) -- but w/ the
institutionalization of creative writing (in the political
not clinical sense, to quote Ron S.) there's assumed to be
a place to go if you want to write poetically, and the
Ph.D. in lit ain't it. Of course what you're probably
talking about is hybrid poeto-critical writing,
which I agree is an especially tough institutional fit. I
could imagine that someone might pull off a thesis under
the direction of one of the academic Language poets or the
critics who do work on avant poetry that was along the
lines of, say, Susan Howe's book on Dickinson, but it would
be somewhat risky, given that part of a thesis director's
job is to ensure that their charge is employable, thus one
must anticipate a larger & less "sympathetic" audience. In
which context subject matter would be much less an issue
than conforming to one of several stylistic paradigms.

Best,
Damian

Filmgruppe Chaos has produced two incredible, full-length movies through =
international, net-wide collaborations with writers, producers, =
animators, actors, musicians, etc. =20

Maldoror-an inspiring realization of the text.  This is a compilation =
from 12 independent film groups/artists in Germany and the U.K.  Each =
group took one chapter of Maldoror.=20

Faites vos jeux.  A European examination of these Bush-driven, =
gun-toting, post-911 days.

Both have garnered great reviews from the Observor and other newspapers =
and mags.

We're currently seeking places in Canada, U.S., U.K. and elsewhere to =
show the films.  Both films are available as videos.

If anyone is interested, or has any leads, please back-channel me.  Jess

Though at the time I was more attracted to bands other than the Clash
(The Germs, Black Flag, The Dead Kennedys, etc.), punk presented an
alternative to the values that surrounded me at the time I was
growing up in Southern California, the 70's and early 80's (ugh! I
think you can all imagine what those values are, no?).  Punk
ideas--of thinking for oneself, doing it for oneself, anarchism,
etc.-- helped to give me a consciousness and led me toward a thinking
life and toward experimentation in the arts (I first heard the word
"anarchy" in a punk song).

Punk's greatest musical achievement wasn't, in my opinion, The Clash
or The Sex Pistols but was opening the door to other possibilities in
rock music and other arts and, in the process, killing off the
big-money arena rock of the 70's.  And some of the music that
followed--bands like Sonic Youth (who have moved far beyond
"Confusion is Sex" into increasingly complex experimentation)--were,
I thought more interesting.

In its early days, punk had an unpredictable, amateurish feel to it
that was lost by the time The Clash were rocking the Casbah.  And
when we talk of punk, we're talking, I think, more about values than
a particular aesthetic--i.e. safety pins, mohawks, etc.  I don't want
to sentimentalize it; there were a lot of stupid things going on
within punk as well--skinheads come to mind (and seventh-graders
carving swastikas into their arms with razor blades).  But it was an
opening of possibilities in American culture, of independence and
experimentation (albiet underground).

Kill yer idols,

A very strong link between punk & writing was the "zine scene" that flourished
in the days just before the appearence of personal computers & the internet.
Most were xeroxed (usually at work, with the most famous being "Between C &
D"--which was printed on tractor paper on a dot matrix printer & sealed up in
a bag.

But there were HUNDREDS of these pubs & stores poped up like Manhattan's
SOHOZAT, Canal & W. Broadway, to sell them. And having hosted readings in
Jersey in that period, that attitude of punk affected many youg poets,
producing furious poetry that kept you awake during long open readings

in the downtown scene, many poets were involved in punk bands. Barb Barg led
teh Avant Squares. Susie Timons was in numerous groups, as was ElinorNauen.
And there was always the hovering presence of Jim Carroll, Richard Hell &
Patti Smith

woman named Kyra- (Kira? cannot remember what band for her..) called "Dos"??
(as in Espanol for two)
had an indie tape back in the late 80's, early 90's, lost it, can't seem to
find any evidence of their incredible music..
if anyone knows of a source...?

Minutemen were super as was Watt's next band, fIREHOSE.

I don't know why, but I get weekly emails from Watt, who still plays.

J, try Watt at http://www.hootpage.com/

--Ak, listening to Strummer and the Mescaleros -- for those of you who
haven't heard Global A Go-Go, you must (if you are a Strummer fan, of course)

Will Shatter OD'd. (RIP)

Bruce Loose got in a car accident that keeps him from performing.

I believe that Ted Falconi and Steve depace went on to other bands.

Where do The Replacements fit in for people on this list? Are they an
important band for poets here? I caught on to them late, maybe partly from
time spent in Minneapolis even when they were no more, but they seem pretty
important to American punk/pre-grunge.
