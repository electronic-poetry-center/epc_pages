The creeks
rob mclennan

	The creeks:

		Mercy does not come from the sky
			Norma Cole, Coleman Hawkins Ornette Coleman


	Watershed. Stretched, a bend. Erupts. To be vulgar, coarse.
	Urban song, a thread of water. Spills. Underground, a Mohawk
	sky. We catch the rain. It snowflakes, tongue. Dark, manifold.
	So much a mirror, corner. Questions, held. Held up. This
	constellation, margin. Deeper than fulfilled, arthritic postures.
	We were not afraid. Thin, silent, mouths. Eye on you and then.


	*


	Search. We hold the river, down. This resolution, meets. Mouth to
	concentration, mouth. I cant go. No stream made, out-of-print.
	Useless, feathered, goods. What drawn and twisted, space. Snow
	warrant. Thin portraits. A simple-minded function. What ritual,
	thing. The trees, the skimming moon. Bookstalls. A brittle,
	darkened room. The pavement, ear. Abyss. Tonal waves direct.


	*


	Atlantic, between. Heavy manner, a centred abyss. This battered dawn,
	bashed ancient stone. The remains of civilization. First thought,
	Ur-thought. Grotesque. The oceans subdivision. Tactless. Define a
	score, a roundabout, a hedge. A supernatural crescent. This heated,
	cooling effort. Passive, energized. History, become a mine. A gravel
	tendril. Soothe. You, who are large in our eyes.

Tinfish Press's website now has a page devoted to the new Steve Shrader
book:
http://tinfishpress.com/?projects=the-arc-of-the-daythe-imperfectionist
<http://tinfishpress.com/?projects=the-arc-of-the-daythe-imperfectionist>
Shrader had an MFA from Iowa and lived in Hawai`i for nearly 40 years,
working
as an English instructor, a journalist, and a graphic designer. Toward
the end
of his life (he died in 2007), he wrote two amazing manuscripts of poems; we
are publishing them both in a large, single volume. This book will be an
important
contribution to the literary history of Hawai`i and America more generally--

I hope you will all talk to your friends and colleagues about it. Please
distribute
the link to everyone who might be interested. We're taking pre-orders,
which
helps with cash to pay thefinal bill, coming soon.

The book should arrive in the next two or three weeks to Tinfish and to
spdbooks.org <http://spdbooks.org>. I'll be on HPR's The Conversation
tomorrow morning (Tuesday)
to talk about it. Tune in if you can. There will be a launch later in
the Fall in
Honolulu, along with a gallery show of his photographs.

aloha, Susan

From BEING DUMB:

=B3I am a dumb writer, perhaps one of the dumbest that=B9s ever lived. Whenever
I have an idea, I question myself whether it is sufficiently dumb. I ask
myself, is it possible that this, in any way, could be considered smart? If
the answer is no, I proceed. I don=B9t write anything new or original. I copy
pre-existing texts and move information from one place to another. A child
could do what I do, but wouldn=B9t dare to for fear of being called stupid.=B2

Originally published online at The Awl:
http://www.theawl.com/2013/07/being-dumb BEING DUMB is now available for

Posting for Anne Tardos:

AN OPEN LETTER TO KENNETH GOLDSMITH FROM ANNE TARDOS

Dear Kenny,

Your piece =E2=80=9CThe Burden of Artists=E2=80=99 Crap=E2=80=9D posted o=
ver a year ago in Harriet
(http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/04/the-burden-of-artists-cr=
ap/),
has just been brought to my attention. I am shocked and dismayed by your
characterization of me. Kenny, we=E2=80=99ve been down this road before. =
Only weeks
after Jackson=E2=80=99s death you publicly accused me of interfering with=
 his legacy
by not immediately publishing all his recordings on your web site. May I
also remind you that later you apologized profusely for your behavior,
albeit in private.=20

I feel compelled to comment on your profound misunderstanding of the part=
ial
sale of Jackson=E2=80=99s library. I have devoted years of my life to arc=
hiving
Jackson=E2=80=99s papers and little known publications. His archive was p=
laced at
the Mandeville Special Collections at UCSD, two years ago. To make this
possible, I had to organize his works with the assistance of several devo=
ted
young poets over many years. Without going through the immense amount of
unsorted papers, and cataloguing them, no institution would have been abl=
e
to recognize the scope of the work. As for the Mac Low library, I made
extraordinary efforts to place it in its entirety with reputable
institutions. I am saddened that you don=E2=80=98t realize that parting w=
ith these
books was heartbreaking for me, too.=20=20

I hope it doesn=E2=80=99t embarrass you too much to know that the books y=
ou describe
are duplicates. Perhaps you are unaware of the enormity of the collection=
,
and that most of Jackson=E2=80=99s books are still in my possession. Your=
 own books,
the ones you are so sure were gone with the rest, and which you had
inscribed to both of us, remain on a bookshelf next to my desk.=20

You write that =E2=80=9Cevidently the poet=E2=80=99s widow wanted to get =
rid of it all.=E2=80=9D
Your condescension is both reckless and misguided. The comparison you mak=
e
with Charles Ives=E2=80=99s heirs is laughable. Are you not aware that Iv=
es=E2=80=99s studio
is being kept as it was during his lifetime, intact and complete at the
American Academy of Arts and Letters, which has meticulously recreated hi=
s
studio, down to the radiator piping? Jackson wasn=E2=80=99t so lucky.=20

Your reference to my reasons for selling part of the library are too
offensive to answer.=20

To bring you up to date, in addition to my own books of poetry, I am
currently editing the third posthumous book of Jackson=E2=80=99s. I have =
also
preserved and conserved all of his heretofore unknown visual works, some =
of
which are currently on exhibit in major European museums and galleries, a=
ll
over the world.
=20
You and I have known each other for many years, and over those years I=E2=
=80=99ve
discovered that conjecture formed from incomplete information nearly alwa=
ys
proves wrong. The heartbreak of a friend=E2=80=99s death is one thing, bu=
t the
heartbreak of maligning and vilifying a friend is quite another. I hesita=
te
to characterize it.=20

Regards,=20

Anne=20

 poem "Drip," which appeared last December in the Journal of Clinical
Oncology, was # 2 on last month's list of the top 20 articles published
in biomedical journals during the past six months. This month it has
dropped to #17. (Still not so bad considering that the other articles
feature topics such as post nasal drip.) If you have no idea what I'm
referring to, let me know and I'll send you the poem in question. rcmgt@yahoo.com

My play about the 1964 reading in San Francisco--Poetic
FICTIONs--featuring Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch--a
L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E-esque excavation of meaning & myth & the creation of the
same--was a success.  Nabbed a video of it.  I enjoyed the energy at the
Boog Fest Poets' Theater and the talent displayed in some cases was at
least memorable.  The Venue was tiny but that was made up for by the
availability of fizzy water and applause.

Am sitting in the BUSINESS OFFICE of the HOTEL PENNSYLVANIA at 5 A.M.
smiling over yet another instance where I'm convinced I actually have a
self much to the chagrin of Dennet and the functionalists.

Hi all,

A few days ago Boog began its 23rd year with the final day of our 7th =20=

annual Welcome to Boog City festival. So with the fest over, some =20
notes on what's in store for this Boog year.

First off, some good and good housekeeping. After a year as small =20
press editor, Kimberly Ann Southwick is moving on to other projects, =20
including her own journal, Gigantic Sequins. And I'm real happy to =20
announce that our new small press co-editors will be Jenn and Chris =20
McCreary. Here are short bios for those of you who may not be familiar =20=

with them:

Jenn McCreary's new full-length collection, & now my feet are maps, is =20=

forthcoming from Dusie Press in 2013. Other works include ab ovo =20
(Dusie Press), a doctrine of signatures (Singing Horse Press), & =20
Odyssey & Oracle (Least Weasel Press). A new chapbook, The Dark Mouth =20=

of Living, is also forthcoming from Horse Less Press this year. She =20
was recently named a 2013 Pew Fellow in the Arts for poetry.

Chris McCreary is the author of three books of poems, including =20
Undone: A Fakebook (Furniture Press). He has reviewed poetry and =20
fiction for venues such as Rain Taxi, The Volta, and The Poetry =20
Project Newsletter.

I have been thinking of Cole Swenson's talk in Glasgow (the Ekphrasis Confe=
rence, this past June) particularly her invocation of the moment where Mary=
 - after the Crucifixion - has an apparition of Jesus in the garden. When s=
he reaches out to touch him (or his garments) He disappears (to be of Life,=
 or Greater than Life?). The event/incident makes me think of the relations=
hip between word and image. That is, when the word tries to reach out and t=
ouch the image, the image disappears. And when the image tries to become th=
e word, the word disappears. That finally there is no utopic rapprochement =
between the two. They live in separate "gardens" with one eye towards each =
other. Yet, like Orpheus & Eurydice we give the two an impossible dream of =
marriage.=0A=0AI don't know if this was Cole's intention, but it is what I =
took away.=A0=0A=0AStephen Vincent=0Awww.stephenavincent.com=0A

I=92m writing with the news that PDF copies of Andy Mister=92s LINER NOTES =
are
available for* *review consideration. If you are interested, write
[publishers at stationhill.org] and we=92ll see a copy to you. Here=92s a b=
rief
description, publishing specifics and excerpts and links to early reviews
as well as praise.

Andy Mister=92s LINER NOTES is a semi-narrative prose poem, a meditation on
alienation and pop culture. Beginning with the Beach Boy=92s unfinished
masterpiece Smile, Mister describes a world populated by ghosts. Adrift on
a sea of drug use, boredom and popular entertainment, Mister traces his
relationship to the obsessive collection of ephemera and the coterminous
feelings of isolation and loss. Like an iPod on shuffle, lyrical
descriptions of urban landscapes and memories of failed relationships mix
with song lyrics and deadpan anecdotes of death, failure.  In the end a
life, like the book itself, is assembled from the detritus of pop culture. =
 As
he writes, =93Each billboard is a monument to our ability to believe in
anything, at least for a moment. Then it=92s gone.=94 But belief=92s shadow
remains, amid the news of a world shot full of holes, which LINER NOTES=92
hauntings seem to delineate like the chalk figure at the center of every
homicide scene we=92ve ever imagined ourselves appearing within=85 =93There=
=92ll
probably be some music there, lining your eyelids.=94* *

**Early Reviews and Praise for LINER NOTES:

=93It's not so often anymore that we read a book of poetry [LINER NOTES] an=
d
think to ourselves, "This poet means exactly what they say." It's a
startling realization, that we so often praise the artistry of a poem or
collection for having accurately captured the artistic ambitions of the
poet, but less commonly consider how and when contemporary poetry is
nonfictional, a direct address from the bared poet within the poet.=94

=93I love the blunt care for real time, with all its gaps & noises & bends,
Andy Mister takes in the searching, powerful scroll of paragraphs that make
up LINER NOTES. Working through the implied vision of an undecided note

Mister puts songs at the heart of his relationship to language & digs away
at the disappearances they reflect in their, and his, histories. =93The wor=

span-o (the small press action network - ottawa) presents:
The Factory Reading Series

with readings by:

	Hoa Nguyen (Toronto)
	Dale Smith (Toronto)
	+ Mari-Lou Rowley (Saskatoon)

lovingly hosted by rob mclennan
Saturday, September 21, 2013;
doors 7pm; reading 7:30pm
The Carleton Tavern,
223 Armstrong Street (at Parkdale; upstairs)

Born in the Mekong Delta and raised in the Washington, D.C. area, Hoa
Nguyen studied Poetics at New College of California in San Francisco. With
the poet Dale Smith, Nguyen founded Skanky Possum, a poetry journal and
book imprint in Austin, TX where they lived for 14 years. The author of
eight books and chapbooks, she currently lives in Toronto where she teaches
poetics in a private workshop and at Ryerson University. Wave Books
published her third full-length collection of poems, As Long As Trees Last,
in September 2012.

Dale Smith teaches at Ryerson University, Toronto. With Hoa Nguyen he
published 10 issues of the always-hip and controversial journal, Skanky
Possum. His book, Poets Beyond the Barricade: Rhetoric, Citizenship, and
Dissent (University of Alabama Press), was published last year, and Slow
Poetry in America (Cuneiform) is forthcoming in winter 2014. His poems,
reviews, and essays have appeared in the Best American Poetry 2002,
Bookslut, Chicago Review, Jacket, New American Writing, and more.

Poet and interdisciplinary adventurer Mari-Lou Rowley has encountered a
timber wolf, come between a black bear and her cub, interviewed an Italian
astronaut, found over 44 four-leaf clovers, and written nine collections
of poetry. Most recently Unus Mundus (Anvil Press 2013) was awarded second
prize in the John V. Hicks Long Manuscript Award. Suicide Psalms, also
published by Anvil in 2008, was shortlisted for a Sask Book Award. Her
work has appeared internationally in literary, arts and science-related
journals including the Journal of Humanistic Mathematics (US) and
Aesthetica Magazines (UK) Creative Works Competition (finalist 2011). She
was one of 20 invited participants in Creative Writing in Mathematics and
Science at the Banff International Research Station in 2010. To feed her
poetry habit she has worked as an advertising manager in Edmonton,

Re. the Romanian translations I mentioned in my previous post, I am very
grateful to Racula Tanesescu for casting the poems into Romanian and to
Chris Tanesescu for inviting me and for furthering the project. They
have done major work in introducing contemporary American poetry to
Romanian readers, including most recently a Selected Poems of Jerome
Rothenberg.

MadHat Press is proud to present "Dear Robert" by Lysette Simmons, winner o=
f the Wild & Wyrd Chapbook Contest, judged by the great CAConrad.

CAConrad writes:

"Dear Robert stole my heart!!  Lysette Simmons is one of my
new favorite poets, and I can't wait to see what she writes for us next!!
Carol Novack died before the release of this book, sadly, so
we hold these poems up in her memory of generosity!!"

Brian Kim Stefans writes:

Dear Robert combines sonic invention and metafictional
whimsy with the wit of a stand-up. "But with well trimmed / hair, so
much / inaction, how could you always / rattle my shoulders?"
Teetering within a welter of voices -- at one point flirtatious, the
next melancholic, the next blandly epistolary or convulsively Surreal
-- the poems tell a story best described as addresses to the Unknown,
appeals for certainty from a damsel haplessly "in flux." These are no
ordinary "all-over" collage poems in the line of Ashbery or Berrigan
but a full-blown experience in a spectral, stochastic poetics
reflecting a singular intelligence.

Available now on Amazon, from the Press, and as an e-book.

cheers,

Labradoodle
An essay on David McGimpsey
Marcus McCann
$4

	A primer on David McGimpsey for those who have never
	heard of David McGimpsey


	The poet laureate of the tragic, the mentally
	unwell, and poor dressers, all who opted out
	of the grading curve of the mall parking lot.
	Patron saint of the dive bars of Montreal.

	Every poem unfolds like an episode
	of Full House. Funny, and then, wham!
	a surprise life lesson. And a hug.
	Except, rather than the cast of Full House,

	it's you doing the hugging, and the man
	you're hugging is a prickly SOB
	who doesn't want to be hugged, he will tell you,
	even though deep, deep down he does.

	That and the Olsen twins. People say,
	Oh, David McGimpsey, he's the guy who writes
	funny poems. Which is a little like saying,
	Hey, he's the guy with the really funny cancer.

Does anybody have a copy of April Galleons handy?
Or know, off hand, the name of the poem that this comes from--

I have a vague memory of it, so I'm pretty sure I don't have the exact
words, but I know I'm pretty close--

"But the thing has to come into being, or else all we'll have is
disagreements, desagreements,
to name a few...."

C

I'd love to get the exact quote so I can use it for a little essay I'm
writing....

thanks!
Feel free to email me at chris.stroffolino@gmail.com
i don't always check this list....

For as long as we can remember, poets have addressed the sun and moon,
distant lovers and heroes, while also separately singing odes to the gods.
The Surrealist painter Leonora Carrington once said, "We learn about the
soul, and we have to listen to the soul." Just as some poets use music for
inspiration, ekphrastic work can go beyond description and manifest as an
influence or force of the art work itself and, sometimes, the artist's
life.

In the course of this workshop, we will look at a the work and lives of a
variety of artists such as Leonor Fini, Frida Kahlo, Dorothea Tanning &
Remedios Varo, as well as numerous poets like Paul Eluard, Allen Ginsberg,
Rachel Eliza Griffiths, Edna St. Vincent Millay and many more, and consider
how ekphrasis can extend beyond mere description of the visual arts and be
combined with address (apostrophe) or the ode as a means to reflect
appreciation of an artist's work.

Labradoodle
An essay on David McGimpsey
Marcus McCann
$4

	A primer on David McGimpsey for those who have never
	heard of David McGimpsey


	The poet laureate of the tragic, the mentally
	unwell, and poor dressers, all who opted out
	of the grading curve of the mall parking lot.
	Patron saint of the dive bars of Montreal.

	Every poem unfolds like an episode
	of Full House. Funny, and then, wham!
	a surprise life lesson. And a hug.
	Except, rather than the cast of Full House,

	it's you doing the hugging, and the man
	you're hugging is a prickly SOB
	who doesn't want to be hugged, he will tell you,
	even though deep, deep down he does.

	That and the Olsen twins. People say,
	Oh, David McGimpsey, he's the guy who writes
	funny poems. Which is a little like saying,
	Hey, he's the guy with the really funny cancer.

I'm wondering whether anyone here is acquainted with Janine Zend, widow of
Toronto poet Robert Zend, and if so, would you be willing to introduce me
to her? I'm writing an essay about RZ and would love the opportunity to
speak with her.

I got up, went downstairs, somehow got my tired old body over the dog =

April Galleons off the bottom shelf, where I had to get my tired old =
body down to the floor and back up, got back over the dog gate somehow, =
upstairs, sat down,
skimmed every page of the book, and though I found that Ashbery starts =
with "but" very often, didnt find the passage. Dang. But I did read my =

Axial Music follows a principle of spontaneous interpersonal composition
without the intention of honoring precedent or previous patterns, guided
instead by radical following of actual sounds generated in an
intentional field. When successful the sound event has a life
independent of the musicians and may generate an altered state of
listening. In addition to sound events, the performance sometimes has
visual and language components.

The Axial Band has performed extensively over the past three years in
New York City and the Hudson Valley.

*David Arner*, musician (piano, harpsichord, percussion), composer, and
longtime proponent of innovative music and spontaneous composition,
teaches at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Performing throughout the
US both solo and collaboratively (with musicians Michael Bisio, Tomas
Ulrich, Jay Rosen, as well as poet/sound-artists Charles Stein and
George Quasha), he has also pioneered a re-vitalization of new music for
silent film (for many years at Upstate films in Rhinebeck, NY, the
Knitting Factory, the National Gallery of Art, and the Whitney Museum).
Recipient of a 1980 NEA Jazz Fellowship. Among his many CDs is the
recent 4-CD boxed set: /Spontaneous Suites for Two Pianos/ (RogueArt
label) (duets with Connie Crothers). *www.davidarner.com*
<http://www.davidarner.com/>

*John Beaulieu*, composer, musician, and healing artist engages multiple
mediums in his exploration of consciousness for healing and greater
spiritual understanding. His work ranges from the development of tuning
forks (tuned to precise mathematical formulas) as musical instruments to
intuitive divination-based sonic systems. He experiments with new
systems for creatively generating music possibilities as part of his
quest to incubate neural pathways, empowering a new sense of reality.

Hi, Don. Good paragraph. But for me what Olson accomplishes, and I think it's the primary thuing he swets out to accomplish, is a modelling of how one learns and how to learn through the act of writing, expanding ever outwards geographically and temporally.

Best,

Mark

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

There was a great review of the Israel Journal, IIanot Review in "The
Review Review." This is issue included work by me, Joy Ladin,
Miriam Libicki, Diane Wakoski, annd others.

http://www.thereviewreview.net/reviews/online-mag-delivers-great-new-writing-israel

ALSO. please please consider using BEAUTY AS VERB as a textbook! We're
trying to get it around thee universities, and it remains, until this
point, the only disability poetics anthology. It includes work by Norma
Cole, Jim Ferris, Bernadette Mayer, Rusty Morrison, Brian Teare, Larry
Eigner and many others. Beyond the poetry, the essays serve as great
readings, not just on poetics, but on mobility, prejudice, and other
aspects of disability. If you write to me, I can try to get you a review
copy - or sample. Best, Jennifer

Here is a new piece of writing of mine. It's a new introduction to seven
visual poems by the Seattle polyartist Joe Keppler. I think these poems by
Joe are important. They blow my mind. I tried to write an introduction to
them that will help you start to understand them in your own way. I also
coded the poems in HTML so that you can view them nicely on pretty much any
size of monitor be it TV size or mobile.

We are extremely pleased to introduce Poor Yorick: a Journal of Rediscovere=
d Objects, a new online journal dedicated to work inspired by hidden or los=
t objects and images of material culture. http://pooryorickjournal.com

PY is now open for submissions of writing and other creative productions in=
cluding but not limited to poems about sculptures and paintings in the back=
 rooms of museums or in hidden corners of public spaces; essays about mural=
s forgotten in plain view; articles on lost photographic archives and resto=
red films; newly discovered letters or manuscripts; photoessays on knickkna=
cks in attics; short films about oddities and curiosities in misbegotten si=
deshows; work in any genre that reminds us of pasts we should not forget.

PY also will partner with select museums to feature holdings from their col=
lections from time to time-holdings such as the skeleton of a man named For=
tune, who came as an inspiration to us in the form of Marilyn Nelson's powe=
rful book Fortune's Bones: The Manumission Requiem.

The rollout of PY in the fall of 2014 already is expected to include a phot=
oessay about abandoned race tracks, ekphrastic poems, a story about a golf =
course that few people know exists, and a piece about the cataloging and ar=
chiving of the many thousands of letters, gifts, and other objects sent to =
Newtown, CT in the wake of the 12/14 massacre.

If you have something or would like to write something that might be approp=
riate for PY, please do send it (see submissions link on the site) or conta=
ct the editor, Erik Ofgang, at editor@pooryorickjournal.com. The editorial =
staff is eager to read work for the rollout of first content. Even if you h=
ave nothing to send, we hope you'll share the news about Poor Yorick.

For as long as we can remember, poets have addressed the sun and moon,
distant lovers and heroes, while also separately singing odes to the gods.
The Surrealist painter Leonora Carrington once said, "We learn about the
soul, and we have to listen to the soul." Just as some poets use music for
inspiration, ekphrastic work can go beyond description and manifest as an
influence or force of the art work itself and, sometimes, the artist's
life.

In the course of this workshop, we will look at a the work and lives of a
variety of artists such as Leonor Fini, Frida Kahlo, Dorothea Tanning &
Remedios Varo, as well as numerous poets like Paul Eluard, Allen Ginsberg,
Rachel Eliza Griffiths, Edna St. Vincent Millay and many more, and consider
how ekphrasis can extend beyond mere description of the visual arts and be
combined with address (apostrophe) or the ode as a means to reflect
appreciation of an artist's work.
