When I do anything when viewing much of Kate Armstrong's work at
http://eventfoundation.securedata.net/kate/projects.html , I find that she has made the action
meaningful, made the action into a poetically significant verb that dominates or overrides the
typical association with the action; in "Cold Chinese Salad", for instance, the action of
clicking and thereby closing the window becomes an event of sudden and unexpected energy, part
of the piece itself, rather than just the closing of a window after the piece is finished. The
action finds/discovers the human dimensions of closing a window, which we usually take for
granted as a kind of page-turning or switch flipping, like turning off the lights when you exit
a room.

All the programming in the world doesn't get much better than this, but affords opportunity to
discover/create a wider range of the human dimensions of technology/programming/science, and a
wider range of new 'media language', a wider realm of expression in this language; if the
programming does not provide such energy and human relation, if the actions are not poetically
significant verbs but instead allow the default language of functionality to blandly assert
itself and dominate the imaginative and poetical, then the loudest statement is from the machine
itself, not the artist, ie, the medium is indeed the message, in such case.

While programming does not often get any better than what she has already done, in the sense
that she has created some wonderfully magical pieces--which is, after all, a big part of the
'goal' for artists, surely--it does expand the range of possibilities dramatically. Those who
sustain invention over the longer run generally have found knowledge of programming useful in
moving forward rather than repeating themselves. There are many artists who either have given up
on web/net.art or are predictable by now, are repeating themselves.

I love Armstrong's line "Because art attracts pretenders" in her piece "Explanation". No
questions are posed explicitly in this simple yet effective piece (though they teem implicitly).
Yes, this is unfortunately the answer to too many questions--but her line also suggests a wider
meaning to the word "pretenders": art attracts people who 'pretend' in many ways, like Chrissie
Hynde and the Pretenders...or storytellers, those who are interested in pretense in a
constructively imaginative way, and this informs the line with something other than censure of
the milieu in which art operates, opens it up more broadly to a deeper consideration of the
nature of art and its milieus, so that we come to see art as attracting "pretenders" of many
types, not all necessarily insufferable but perhaps equally desperate to "pretend", though in
different ways, and with different goals.

More generally, one is struck with her writing. She's an excellent writer. We read on her site
that she has studied philosophy, which isn't surprising; she has a delicious and highly
intelligent sense of language and humour, her own voice. She retains a high and exhilarating
intellectual energy and humour in her work. We don't run across titles as good as "Delicate
Weasels" very often, which is another finely concentrated piece on her site.

The writing is spare and telling. The use of media and tech is in synch with the writing. The
verbs drive the work, and the idea of the verb extends beyond the word into the interaction and,
occassionally, the animation.

"Because elevators were all invented by the same person." Good elevators. Ding.

Bernadette Mayer's The Formal Field of Kissing, Catchword (1990), still in
print,
translates Catullus and Horace.

Bill Luoma translates Sappho, Besantius, & Simias in An Anthology of New
(American) Poets, Talisman (1998).

Mark McMorris is also trained in the classics, while he hasn't published
translations I think his poetry reflects it.

Hello Tom!

Are yuo referring to Bulato''s vispo & soundpo anthologies? If so - perhaps
you might know where i can get a couple of soundpo ones? I have the original
vsipo in Russian.

Michael, others:

As a participant in Bernadette Mayer's "Experiments in Poetry" workshop at
The St. Mark's Poetry Project probably 10 years ago, I wanted to point to
her tremendous significance in turning a whole new generation of New York
City poets, including myself, on to the richness of classical forms such as
the Greek Epigram.  It seems utterly radical in retrospect that Bernadette
would confront all these mostly younger poets who would join her in that
workshop -- eager and almost impatient to discover everything new -- with
numerous xeroxed pages from the Greek anthology.  Of course she would also
immerse us to Stein, Joyce and other modernist works and a host of other
works she considered inspiring, such as Luria's "The Mind of a Mnemonist."
I think Bernadette presented the classical work alongside Stein and others
in an effort to move her workshop participants away from a Norton Anthology
of Poetry linear view of literary history and also in an effort to show that
our perceptions of traditions such as classical poetry were in many ways
shaped by the outdated translations that had been imposed on us in school.
Rediscoveries of classical forms such as the Epigram were all part of a
radical rediscovery and possession of poetic form, including classical
forms, during the workshop.

Another aspect that made revisiting classical work seem viable at the time
were the more contemporary translations of classical poets such as Catullus
by contemporary poets such as Bernadette and others.  The contemporary
phrasing, explicit sexual content and often vulgar language taboo in earlier
translations of this work that has more recently been employed by
translators in an effort to reinvigorate the original poems, made the
classical work seem more viable than ever and available to us as an
influence.  In those translations, we noted the heavy hand of the
contemporary poet present, the obvious anachronisms of some of the language
choices, but preferred that heavy hand to the supposed transparency and
authority that more traditional translations sought to present.
Bernadette's own Catullus translations (which can be found in A Bernadette
Mayer Reader from New Directions) are an excellent example of this stance
towards the translation/interpretation of classical work.

Yeah, Bill--take a look at the Lykiard--and of course the original--and
you'll see the fragmentation.  It's not an abrupt dislocation of texts, but
you can definitely see where Burroughs learned his craft.  Jess

P.S.
Lykiard in his introduction "cuts up" the Knight translation, only in a
different way.

Pound was the obvious forerunner in this and its good nowadays to see the
many translations of Classical and modern poets for those of us such as
myself who know virtually only English. I like Catullus: recently I read
through the Eclogues by Virgil (it had a Latin version on the LHS). I
"taught myself" how to read Chaucer by listening to tapes and its
interesting to see the many versions of the Illiad and The Odyssey, even
translations of French writers from such as Montaigne to eg Deridda (will
new translations of these French philosophers affect their views expressed?
or the interpretaion of them?): its importaant to have alert and various
translators. Hamish Dewe in New Zealand translates such as Pessoa and others
from the Portugese and Jack Ross has done work on the Spanish poets (eg
Borges) and also the Italian such as Pindar.  I once put som "French " into
a long poem and  my line went:

Something like: " I'd say at this point: " je vous donnez la
rouglaneavoisent d'dici de la" except that I dont know what it means, and I
dont know any French."  in the early days when I started reading locally and
that got a laugh. I cant remember what the poem was about.   And I published
a poem that was titled: "Der Beshrunken Hominem" ... I have a habit of
inventing words... of course the title doesnt mean anything except maybe
"the shrunken men/man". I know no German and although I did study Latin once
(I know enough to know that I should have had "homines") I also
inadvertently created  from " golden cauldrons" the word "goldrens" (not
because of any Joycean impulse its was a mistype) but such "creative erors"
are common I suppose: the epigrams that Mayer talks of would be good
starting points for poems. That was the good thing I am now discovering vis
a vis Pound is his sense of the simultaneity of history, mythology, language
and  the great aliveness and light that he can bring (leavened with the
appropriate dark). Michelle Leggott of NZ integrates modern phrases and
"classic" terminology also with quotes  form NZ poets, Herrick and Pound and
Ben Jonson (maybe via Pound) in her DIA (which itself -  the title - means
through (and alos is another word for Dionysius's (or Bacchus's) Island but
also puts us through time and into ancient realms with words such as
"melismata" "incunablua" and so on: another writer (tragically) recently
deceased who ranged widely and rather quixotically was Alan Brunton in his
book eg "Moonshine" ( aphrase used by the nuclear physicist Rutherford when
Leo Szilard, who invented the chain reaction, asked at a lecture if Nuclear
energy could ever be used as a fuel or large energy source): and "Moonshine"
also plays with the idea of nuclear decay and maybe the fragmentations of
language and the moral "fall" as it "follows the life of Rutherford ( the
New Zealander who first split the atom) and others such as the Curies and in
which he used the term Uranus which connects to Uaranium and the planet and
the Greek god; he is also "playing" with sounds, "strangenesses" via real
moonshine (the romantic image and the "technical journals"), codes and
letters (maybe somewhat a la Zukovsky but he was  certainly a brilliant
original like Len Lye) ..... also Michael Radich "transliterated some
Japanese  in some early copies of "A Brief History of the Whole World" (then
edited by Alan Loney) a few years ago .. there is another NZ writer who
translates  and interpretes such as Sappho and another writer of that time I
dont recall the poet or the (other)person he
translates/interprets......Wystan Curnow will know him.   Some thoughts,
Richard.

david meltzer taught a class in jewish mysticism/kabbalah at new college in
the 80s.

robert duncan used the zohar as a key reference text in writing the opening
of the field.  "often I am permitted to return to a meadow" includes
images/lines from the zohar--  of "a field folded"-- from a part of the
zohar that describes the field and "the cave therein" where adam was buried.

duncan later studied kabbalah with meltzer.

David Melnick's Men in Aida immediately comes into mind, a homophonic
translation of the first three books of the Iliad.

I believe that Tom Mandel's done work in this area (translating
Shakespeare's sonnets into English from Celan's German if I remember
rightly).

Not an accident that both David & Tom matriculated at the U. of Chicago.

Other poets who have certainly been influenced by close reading of the
old texts would include Bob Perelman and Ben Friedlander, no?

Quickly, as announced here a couple of weeks ago,
Skanky Possum will publish later this year ancient
Greek translations by Kent Johnson and Alexandra
Papaditsas called "The Miseries of Poetry: Versions
from the Greek." I couldn't help mentioning it here
given the context of this thread.

        *****

From Miseries:

Eros

On paper wings, pressed by Phokylidos
the Epileptic, I flap to Olympus, panting,
seeking my master, Eros. But he looks
through me, says no more dog-style fucking:
He sees my graying face-hairs and flies off,
looking outwards toward nothing—
while I stand transfixed in the breeze
made by his thin wings of gold.

—Anakreon, 572-490 BC. With the equally famed Ibykos,
he was for many years court poet of Polykrates, the
Tyrant of Samos. Upon the murder of his employer,
Anakreon moved on to the court of Hippias, Athenian
ruler of no less tyrannical nature. His refined and
sophisticate verse is almost wholly decadent in theme.
He died, it is said, choking on a grape.

            ******

The book will be available later this year for $6.
Send a check for that amount plus $1.50 for postage to
Dale Smith (2925 Higgins Street, Austin, Texas 78722)
Here are a few supporting words for the book:

We have all always desired the eyeless goddess, the
handsome whore-boy, the Megala Louloudia. Here they
are. Ever since the cache was discovered at Montazah
Palace, we’ve been waiting for translations suitable
for Greek menus everywhere.  Had the Greeks invented
fortune cookies, they could not have foretold the
strange beauty of these versions.

-Eleni Sikelianos

I'm doubled over by the Miseries of Poetry, folded
into a mirror world of literature and here live on
moth-ambrosia, play happily with possible ancillas of
the Pre-Socratics.

-Garrett Kalleberg

Like the Jews, if Kent Johnson didn't exist, someone
would have to invent him. His mind leaks nomads
constantly naming world-historic hinges as if
inscription were always underfoot. You can't pull
Catullus out of the 'incubated / god, writing himself
into being' but you can pull the door open. Literature
is close to fraud, evanescent and trembling in these
times of incipient terror. Johnson's approach
deconstructs and exacerbates that fraud; I think of
his work as returning to the (re)creation of language
- political and sexual language, the languages of the
last people speaking on earth.

-Alan Sondheim

If they ever need a Classics Geek on "Beat the Geeks,"
Dr. Kent Johnson is their man. The Miseries of Poetry
is an operatically nerdy intervention in the
transmission of ancient lyric, a scurrilous,
fantastical, erudite, shameless, and often very moving
addition to the Geek--er, Greek--Anthology. More
faithful in its peregrinate Sapphic incontinence than
most of the last two centuries of vanilla-flavored
translations, this sheaf of cracked-amphora smut will
change the way people misinterpret Linear B forever.
Roll over, Richmond Lattimore: this is not your
father's Mimnermus.

-Kasey Silem Mohammad

Labor Day

Sitting at the desk
at the end of summer
(read: the desk at the end
of summer) a cat in the lap
licking wrist, my head cocked
at just the right listening angle,
I stumble on a good match, not
perfect but good, a line in the
disappearing notebook with
the red pen attached, the
cars run under blue sky
& it all blows away
in a sneeze.

contains an additional hope, that
the pain of childbirth will cease

under its reign. Bitterness
under the rain this Labor Day,
recalling another Job, familiar
as well with windy speeches, praising
the natural order     but how

do *we* persist, persevere further
into the fog, so that our features
don't blur, becoming incandescent
in the milk-white glow of the television
at night? We labor under this

dissolve, not sudden -- spreading gray
mushroom clouds -- but gradual,
day-to-day, a slipping of the will,
indecipherable now, as you
take this short rest from your labor . . .

You think so?  I've only seen it used to distinguish serious poets from
those working in received traditions--from, that is, "mainstream" poets.

Mark DeCarteret | Eight Poems

Nothing New, If the pig had to fly, The Gate,
Alchemy is Not in My Vocabulary, Surplus,
The Lore of the Extinct, Toward a Definition
of Farewell, and The Same Only Different

from "The Same Only Different"

At a point where I'm defined
more by the holes in my story
than I am by the wood I sprout
or the pen with its belly of blue
discharged from my fingers,
so full of ideas my chin's
messy with them, what chance
do I have of convincing you
of the next line's credibility?

Mark DeCarteret was born in Lowell MA in 1960 and has lived within an hour
or two drive ever since. His poetry has recently appeared in CONDUIT,
HUNGER MAGAZINE, PHOEBE, SALT HILL, 3rd BED, and AMERICAN POETRY: THE NEXT
GENERATION (Carnegie Mellon Press, 2000). His books of poems are OVER EASY
(Minotaur Press, 1991), REVIEW: A BOOK OF POEMS (Kettle of Fish Press,
1995), and THE GREAT APOLOGY (Oyster River Press, 2001).

ARGUMENTS INVOLVING RELATIONS

HANG! EH! RANG!  The exalted language in unseen rhythm delivers a thousand
intelligent generations.  Too mechanical, the imagination.  There the notion of
the earth.  An impression of voices forever mad in ancient animal mysteries.
When an opening spit its roots up through penetrating surface, sexual flow
consummated in understanding.  Human beings hugging & kissing the imagination
at last gasp & respond.  Tension within her possible body continued to exist.
Red birds & rain pierce the wall of her skin & sharpened the amputated organ.
A most baffling emotion drew a cupped hand over scribed stones while anxiety
carried the girlish boy under the mattress.  Jeweled painting marking flesh.
Dogs clasped his furrowed heart & certain red accumulated liquids brushed her
body.  Clear hearing drowned visible eyes, activated her nine hearts & raised
his entry upon her.  Over their echoes an object from the sky.  "You see me
flying through bodily decisions.  My dream is air rubbed in exchange of fiery
passing."  (1.  Foreign electricity combined with lace fruit is sweeter after
the lover's meal. 2. Wine bulbs mixed & sprayed possess musical appearance &
loose marks.  3. Snakes after retreat acquire thickness & a piercing
character.)  Blow, inhale, repeat & maintain new sexual heights.  Hearing
themselves romantic, they carved & contemplated opening with figs & piety.  A
network of red & white bodies into near darkness;  they confirmed experiments
of ice shape & suspended physique.  (An entire night on the underside of the
noisy floor as an opportunity for sharing climax.)  & the moon's fermata can
chew the nipple; the blood cell becomes a tool.  Behind a pagan culture steam
rises from a gray sculpture & flesh is flung under trees.  Silence on the part
of stress-baring plasma inside the bloodstream.  Insects' broken & delicate
fruit for ecstatic union.  The elephant woman with sequential liquid disgorges
each breed of fallen lover.  Their appearance in a diseased system outphases
her bodily intensity.  Bind measure?  Sexual enthusiasm records violent attacks
on lower information centers.  Sweat in the remotest corner of one woman's
beauty bursts & follows a tear.  Carbon harmony in a cushion, polished head,
blushing rose dotted machine on her back.  The yogi exchanges islands for
heart-beating boat of sucking red liquor at night.

these two heroes could be a prize

the false eyescratching

put the tea on cold for me, leave
four drips in the long cable stop
drinking my orange juice. maybe
a moment's thought
before you leave for tijuana with
a dose of sorrow,
a teen archivist,
a troupe of cats,
my one good suit,
my last red cent,
a careworn ghost,
a headful of pus.
i don't mean to be simple
but is that a clownface
in your purse,
a horsefoot
in your shirt,
a bloody apple tossed carelessly into your
formerly blood-free apple basket.
can't i trade
this gravity puller
for the painless ether
of not

having asked you
to weed
my yard?

Probably by default: but I mentioned a writer (NZ) who is now in Japan who
"interpretes" in that culture: and ok "Pounding Fascism" by Bernstein is a
good take on Pound, but that aside and the terrible issue of his broadcasts
and "the Fascists Cantos " aside: he was one of those (one of the first or
early ones at least) to bring Chinese and Japanese culture in. I think that
we maybe need to acknowledge more the other influences which are "classical"
and rich also: paradoxically the English language has picked up a lot of
Arabic, Inidan,African and other influences and fewer has been absorbed
directly into the United States: certain British intellectuals were more
open in he early days to African and Indian and other influences: but after
Pound's contributions surely were important: then there's Olson's and the we
have the  waves of US writer from the Beats on including eg Susan Howe and
others....the "clssics" if they are say Greek...well its debatable that they
are Eurocentric per se ( the Greeks themselves being invaded by Asiatic
influences): I see writers experimental and other ranging across the whole
spectrum.
 A lot of people on the List will groan but  enjoyed reading David Denby's
book "Great Books" now the whole debate is there and I sould connect with
him as I had gone back to Uni in my 40s...I was thinking of studying the
classics formally: having been a bit dismissive of them prior: I would like
to have at least had that course ( at Columbia Uni, NY) that he did "under
my belt" but as someone is translating Pound into Chinese we need to be
reciprocating (as many are) with Chinese works and other civilisations and
valorizing the works of indigenous peoples.  I am always fascinated by Maori
culture and have read some of their mythology: they also were pre literate
but I  their carvings and sculptures is a language: there is also the oral
tradition. I think that Rothenberg has looked at the American Indian culture
nad the Maya etc was looked at and studied and valued by Olson and another
US poet whose name escapes me just now.

I always feel that I am way behind in my knowledge all round even in the
main stream but I have no doubt that ALL human culture including "classics"
is of value and if someone is studying classics and doesnt want to go
"outside maybe that's not good" but its better that committing crime or
exploiting or bombing people. But I take your quip it easy for us to revert
by default to "Eurocentric things" and I fell about that debate.... Roads
lead not to Rome only but constantly in new directions. Richard Taylor.

i have chosen a shakespearian poem called "venus and adonis", to
translate into street language.
this poem is 200 stanzas long, and is a poem of seduction, the
experienced venus trying to entice the young boy, adonis.
not only have i had to change the language, but also certain facts,
i.e. adonis doesn't ride a horse he drives a car, he doesn't hunt
wild pig, he drag races his car etc..
in the passage selected below venus has kept adonis with her for
three hours by stealing his keys, and is now thinking of new ways to
persuade the boy to love her.




the venus of marrickville.
narrator
time is running out for our sweet venus
she's done her dash, she's got no more to say.
she knows she cannot hold her dear adonis
he wriggles free and turns to walk away.
and as he walks he chuckles cheekily
and from his pocket pulls his car's spare key.   43

but this does not displease the girl at all
for in this act our venus sees new hope
she wonders why adonis has for so long, stalled
when in his pocket had the key to his escape.
his actions so far seeming to deceive
when all the time he had the means to leave.     44

and now he turns the key and revs the beast
the full-blown engine roars with all its might
the horsepower he is ready to unleash
he grips the wheel and holds onto it tight.
he revs it hard, as hard as he can
and in his mind the boy becomes a man.           45

the gleaming duco with not a scratch upon it
a hotter car in marrickville could not be found
twin fours and blower popping from the bonnet
twelve inch fats and mag wheels all around.
as he presses the pedal flat to the floor
the chromed protrusions throbbing even more.     46


venus wondering why adonis stayed so long
yet seemed to act so cool and oh so distant
she thought perhaps she came on far too strong
but now knew she was right to be persistent.
and so she stands in front of it
and says "this car's a heap of shit!"            47

shit? adonis cries above the noise.
"shit!" venus replies, "a pile of shit."
this comment gets adonis quite annoyed
with this a tender nerve she seemed to hit.
"this car is painted shiny just for show
it's just a pose, it doesn't really go."         48

venus
i've seen you cruising down the streets of marrickville
on friday nights with all your yobbo friends
hanging out the windows for their thrills
they don't care whose values they offend.
your precious car is nothing but a hoon mobile
just for show and but for real.                  49

narrator
at this adonis works himself into a state
how dare she talk about his car this way
her teasing now has made him quite irate.
adonis
what would you know about it anyway
you're just a dipstick bimbo chick
with high heeled shoes and red lipstick.         50

i bet you couldn't even drive a car like this
let alone know what makes it go.
your slagging is as weak as piss
why don't you try to slag something you know.
this car can blow any car off the strip
and you know shit, so shut your stupid lip.      51

venus
open the bonnet, let me see inside
your wild beast's guts to me you'll show
and i will prove to you i have not lied
i'll tell you all there is to know.
narrator
he pulls the lever, she undoes the latch
her newest scheme begins to hatch.               52

indeed the engine was a monsterous beast
a full blown 454 with all eight pistons pumping
so finely tuned, all parts expertly greased
twin carbies polished, chromed and hissing.
a thumping hunk of total power
could easy do 200 k per hour.                    53




venus
so turn it off and let me have a look
let me inspect this pulsating motor
narrator
she bent forward and carefully she took
from the distributor case the silver rotor
about mechanics a lot she didn't know
but knew without this bit it wouldn't go.        54

she slams the bonnett shut and taunts the boy
adonis quickly understands what she has done.
he looks at her with looks that could destroy
gets out and round that car they run.
she throws the rotor in to the bushes
he chases it and past her pushes.                55

beside the car she stands so silently
whilst he, down on his knees, looks for the part.
so determined she wont let that poor boy be
not seeming very logical but driven by her heart.
she seems so calm but she is not
and silently again begins to plot.               56

I mentioned to my teddy bear that there was this 'thread" or "chain" on the
list about
translations, and he said unto me "but have they mentioned Delmore Schwartz's
"The Winter Twilight, Glowing Black and Gold?'" "No, why should they?" "Because
it presents itself as a MODERNIZATION of that Shakespeare sonnet, "the time of
year thou mayst in me behold.'" "Yeah, but that isn't one of Schwartz's best."
"Nor is it one of our favorite Shakespeare poems" (I was little taken aback by
his use of the royal we here). "Yeah, but while Shakespeare's reputation---even
on your 'experimental poetry' list (is that what you call it?)---can withstand
calling attention to a relative clunker, Schwartz's can not. So, DON"T,
whatever you do mention that poem on that list, for the love of what Lou Reed
calls the pure spirit of poetry or whatever he calls it in "I Love Women" (or
is it "The Pow Pow Pow, the Power of Positive Drinking.")." "well, the schwartz
poem isn't really a clunker, it's just not quite as good as "Far Rockaway" or
"Dogs are Shakespearean, Children Are Strangers"---I still prefer it to the
Shakespeare poem." "Yeah, but that's just because it is a modernization, er,
translation. That's what they're looking for on that list---quality isn't the
issue AT ALL." Then the tutu bear narrativized "behind our unseen faces" and I
found us skirting around Kenneth Koch's "Art of Love" again....

Labor Day



As a holiday it is much like Groundhog Day

Once a year the American worker is a curiosity like Punxsatawney Phil,

stepping into the sun of media attention,

then slipping through the country’s consciousness

to go back into the hole of media oblivion for another year

And though we never learn whether the worker saw his shadow,

a safe prediction would be for another year of winter


Parade (3)



At the parade that took place a few days before
the day designated to celebrate working people
the unions marching were in a small minority,
not prominently displayed,
                                            not widely applauded,
                                                                                 while
the parade was dominated
                                            by assorted sordid politicians
                                                                                            and numerous novelty acts

And the people were content to collect crumbs of candy
which, in honor of the holiday, were at least real crumbs

Dear All:

Fanny Howe's ECONOMICS (Chicago: Flood Editions, 2002) received an excellent
review in the Chicago Tribune yesterday. The book is readily available
through either of the following:
            www.floodeditions.com
            www.spdbooks.org

Here is the review:

--------------------
A privileged circle in her sights
--------------------

Fanny Howe's short stories comfort the afflicted, afflict the comfortable

By Maureen McLane. Maureen McLane is a fellow at the Harvard University
Society of Fellows, a poet and the author of "Romanticism and the Human
Sciences."

Economics

By Fanny Howe

Flood Editions, 134 pages, $14 paper

"Economics" is a horrible book, deliciously so. In publishing this collection
of Fanny Howe's stories, the independent Chicago press Flood Editions has
given us an object that registers like a small literary landmine, placed
years ago but only now exploding.

Most of these stories were written in the 1970s and '80s, the author's note
tells us, and they delineate the predicaments of self-styled liberals and
working-class couples who reckon with social change since the '60s. So while
there is a slight period-piece feel to some of these stories--evoking as
several do a Boston riven by racial conflict, political marches,
consciousness-raising seminars and so on--nevertheless these fictions pack a
sometimes-grim, sometimes-amusing, cumulative wallop.

I suspect that some readers will find this a mildly repellent collection,
Howe's occasionally mordant sensibility annihilating any readerly desire to
be solicited, comforted, mirrored, enlarged. This is not, in other words, an
Oprah book. "The white couple who adopted the black child were not happy with
what they got." So begins the first story, "The Weather," the biting tone of
which progressively intensifies. Howe does not love such characters, nor does
she indulge them; the skewering of narcissistic liberal pieties here is
relentless. Howe focuses steadily on the wreckage caused by self-deluding,
self-pleased privileged folk; her sympathy goes to those who lose out
according to the social and sexual economics governing late 20th-Century
American life: "Sometimes a child is born--or bought--into a family in which
it never feels comfortable." "[A]t her age she would have a hard time finding
a permanent new job."

In Howe's fictional universe, those with choices--i.e., with money--fiercely
protect their prerogatives; those with less freedom often find themselves
colluding, however ruefully, in their own constraints. As the working-class
wife observes at the end of the story "Lotto," "So much for escape." Moments
of recognition are often moments in which a character recognizes
attenuation--not the presence of something but a waning, a thinning. In
"Fidelity," a man who has devoted large amounts of energy to escaping his
home life suddenly realizes that his long-suffering wife has finally, more or
less happily, accommodated herself to the situation:

"This freedom was all that he had ever desired, to be able to come and go
without suffering her resentment at the end. But now that he had what he
wanted, it was horrible to discover that she did too."

So, as the shrinks say, getting what you want doesn't get you what you want.

In such pieces, Howe is an efficient sketch artist, conjuring a milieu, a
relationship, and an epiphany in fewer than seven pages. She can also weave
longer, more complex, equally unconsoling fictions. Perhaps the subtlest
story here is "Gray," which follows a woman, a computer assistant to a
professor, as she pursues his request to unpack the mystery of a grade
change: Was it computer error or human error? The original instructor and
grader is now dead; no one at the academic institution remembers the student,
who is now protesting her lowered grade (what had been an "A" appears in the
records as a "C"). The woman eventually puts together the relevant backstory,
which involves the dead instructor's sexual and intellectual malfeasance. She
also realizes that her boss would have suspected this all along, and that her
ferreting out of the truth is inconvenient for him, the institution, and
indeed herself:

"The professor would be embarrassed because he would have guessed it was
something like this. And so would she. And the embarrassment would bind them
weirdly as they went up the stairs and together changed the grade to an A."

Howe has a great feel for the way failure and embarrassment bind people
together. Even more strikingly, she keeps her eye on the differential costs
such embarrassments exact: Our hero will not be rewarded for her tenacity;
she will, like whistleblowers low on the totem pole everywhere, be
ostracized, most likely let go.

Heroes without heroism, stoics without a stoic philosophy--these are Howe's
sympathetic characters, unillusioned but also unraging. Those more familiar
with Fanny Howe's poetry than her novels may be surprised by this volume: Its
social critique and its ruthless evisceration of privileged female liberals
(formerly radicals) seem far away from her erotically and philosophically
minded poetry. But a common thread in Howe's work is this capacity for
critique--whether in the domain of self-analysis, social and political
analysis, or metaphysical reflection.

Moving between Chekhovian explorations of melancholic misunderstanding and
incisive social satire, Howe in this book keeps her feet firmly planted in
the dirt of the conventions of realism. Her most gleefully animus-ridden
stories read as a wickedly informed indictment of a circle and class she
apparently knows well. Howe grew up in Boston and lived there as an adult;
she then left the East for the West Coast, where she had long lived until
returning recently to Massachusetts. Only one intimately familiar with the
class hatred seething below mid-to-late 20th Century white privilege could
write so trenchantly about it; only someone still furious about it would feel
a need to write about it in this way. Howe's icy anatomies of privilege
co-exist intriguingly with her warmer stories of missed chances, bad bets,
making do and getting by. It is striking that spoiled women are the major
targets of Howe's occasionally poisoned darts; one feels this is truly an
argument among the women of the family, so to speak, and perhaps an argument
with her generation.

The counter-revolutionary project
to resolve the crisis of modernity
unfolded in the centuries of the Enlightenment.

The primary task of this Enlightenment
was to dominate the idea of immanence
(without reproducing the absolute dualism of medieval culture)

by constructing a transcendental apparatus
capable of disciplining a multitude of formally free subjects. . . .
It was paramount to avoid the multitude's being understood,

a la Spinoza, in a direct, immediate relation with divinity and nature,
as the ethical producer of life and the world.
On the contrary, in every case mediation

had to be imposed on the complexity of human relations. . . .
Hence the triad *vis-cupiditas-amor* (strength-desire-love)
was opposed by a triad of specific mediations.

Nature and experience are unrecognizable
except through *the filter of phenomena*;
human knowledge cannot be achieved

except through *the reflection of the intellect*;
and the ethical world is incommunicable
except through the *schematism of reason*.

What is at play is a sort of weak transcendence,
which relativizes experience and abolishes every instance
of the immediate and absolute in human life and history. . . .

because claiming that humans
could immediately establish their freedom
would be a subversive delirium.

(From *Exile*, Hardt and Negri, pp. 78-79)

Also, here is this piece that appeared in the LA Weekly last month by
Coleman on same subject, after she was shunned for critiquing Maya Angelou's
poetry:
Not sure if it's the same piece in the Nation...

Hunt and Peck
Wanda Coleman, LA Weekly
August 9, 2002

Earlier this year, I summarized Maya Angelou's "A Song Flung Up to Heaven"
in the Los Angeles Times Book Review:

In writing that is bad to God-awful, "Song" is a tell-all that tells nothing
in empty phrases and sweeping generalities. Dead metaphors (sobbing embrace,
my heart fell in my chest) and clumsy similes (like the sound of buffaloes
running into each other at rutting times) are indulged. Twice-told crises
(being molested, her son's auto accident) are milked for residual drama.
Extravagant statements come without explication and schmooze substitutes for
action . . . . There is too much coulda shoulda woulda. Unfortunately, the
Maya Angelou of "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" seems small and inauthentic,
without ideas, wisdom or vision. Something is being flung up to heaven all
right, but it isn't a song.

Reactions to my critical rip caused an immediate furor in the
African-American community, yet none of the many letters reportedly sent to
the L.A. Times was ever published, for who-knows-what reasons. End of story?
Not quite. As bizarre punishment for my violation of the unwritten law that
blacks not criticize one another in front of whites, I was then not allowed
to appear at Eso Won Books, L.A.'s popular outlet for African-American
literature (and pseudo-literature), for the signing of an anthology I
contributed to, "Griots Beneath the Baobab: Tales From Los Angeles"
(co-edited by Randy Ross and L.A Weekly's Erin Aubry Kaplan). The message?


Critically reviewing the creative efforts of present-day African-American
writers, no matter their origin, is a minefield of a task complicated by the
social residuals of slavery and the shifting currents in American
publishing. Into this 21st century, African-Americans are still denied full
and open participation in the larger culture. Thus, our books remain
repositories for the complaints and resentments harbored against the nation
we love, as well as paeans to the courage, fortitude and sacrifice of peers
and forebears.


For those who need reminding, books by writers of color were still largely
found in the anthropology sections of libraries and bookstores until the
civil rights movement was well under way. (The glory rush of pride, wonder
and dismay I felt whenever I stood before those sections has never been
forgotten.) In grade school, circa 1954, the year "under God" was inserted
into the pledge of allegiance, works by Negroes were treated as contraband,
and confiscated by white teachers or administrators. Outside of home and
church, creative writing by colored people did not seem to exist except for
those authors who were assigned as classroom reading during Negro History
Week (Black History Month since 1976). Of those, James Baldwin, Ralph
Ellison, Langston Hughes and Richard Wright were invariably our designated
spokesmen.


Getting hold of their books, however, was problematic if not impossible and
meant leaving the ghetto to visit public libraries, or borrowing from
friends or relations -- on one's solemn oath to return the precious tome.
Few Los Angeles bookstores then featured black literature, even in the
sociology section, and few publishers braved carrying more than two
African-American authors. Black-owned presses, sans white patronage, led
short lives. Books by blacks had even less of a shelf life when reviews --
good or bad -- failed to appear. Good reviews written by whites were the
ideal, but bad reviews were welcomed if they generated enough controversy to
sell copies. The few black reviewers were usually one of the ranking
spokesmen, and between them lay an ideological divide -- those writing for
whites and those writing for blacks, with the former receiving far greater
attention.


The truths of our daily lives defined the truths for our literature: We were
constantly discriminated against, monitored and censored. In defense and
support of our writers, book clubs, discussion groups and writers' orga
nizations emerged -- in L.A., Vassie May Wright's Our Authors Study Clubs,
the Black Writers' Guild (later absorbed by the WGAw), and, eventually, the
International Black Writers' Association and the World Stage in Leimert
Park. But the majority of "folks" were reached via the grapevine (a.k.a.
"the drum"); word of mouth was the primary news-and-review resource. If
gossip, rumor and speculation were its liabilities, it was swifter than
radio and TV and -- best of all -- was uncensored by the white
establishment. (Any posture resembling that taken by Eso Won made a little
more sense in those days.)


In 1963, Arna Bontemps published his "American Negro Poetry" anthology,
which reintroduced older poets such as Gwendolyn Brooks and introduced the
more racially conscious scions of education, miseducation and self-education
that converged in the Muntu Group, or the Black Arts Movement -- Nikki
Giovanni, Ted Joans, LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), et al. Outside Bontemps'
radar, writers and journalists like Ishmael Reed were making a name for
themselves. And by the end of the '60s, popular fiction writers like Alex
Haley, Chester Himes, Iceberg Slim and Frank Yerby were reaching audiences
both black and white, as a constellation of once-silenced voices exploded
into print and onto screen and stage.


Following the August 1965 riots, Budd Schulberg's Watts Writers (Quincy
Troupe, Kamaau Da'ooud) reinforced racial pride and spirited entitlement to
unfettered speech. But the price most paid for this newfound freedom was
scorching reviews by white book critics, and in having black authors' work
ignored for literary grants and prizes. Knowing they were not exempt from
the currents affecting all writers, they became equally adept at playing the
literary games of cronyism, favoritism and patronage. Impatient with the
racist criticism that truncated their literary careers, they demanded
same-race interviewers and reviewers. Supported by the leading black
celebrities of the day, and underwritten by a riot-singed loosening of cultu
ral constraints, African-American reviewer-journalists began appearing in
the mainstream print media.


Meanwhile, what had begun with "Oliver Brown v. the Board of Education of
Topeka, Kansas" (1954), and public school desegregation, resulted in the
boon of black-studies programs in American colleges and universities
throughout the 1970s. Since then, America has produced the largest educated
population in its history, racism aside. New writers have emerged from
workshops, MFA and Ph.D. programs via whatever means necessary --
affirmative action, grants, student loans and scholarships. The
publish-or-perish mandate of academic life, in tandem with increases in the
black middle and under classes, accelerated the outcry for cultural redress.
An explosion into print of new kinds of writing to satisfy this boom market
followed, meaning an inevitable diversity of black authors across genres --
from Octavia Butler to Walter Mosley to Gary Phillips to Terry McMillan.
Simultaneously, a fourth generation of fiction writers, social critics and
academics has emerged, along with a burgeoning black avant-garde claiming
influences from the Absurdists to the Surrealists, including rap/hip-hop
writers flavored by Gil Scott-Heron and the Last Poets, the Nuyoricans, the
Slam writers and acculturated others. The depth and breadth of writing
across disciplines by those who identify as African-American is now so
staggering it outstrips the available review media.


It is thus incumbent upon any book reviewer to grasp the multifaceted
broadening of what was once simply summarized as "The Black Experience," and
it is the duty of the African-American reviewer to accurately portray,
critically assess and convey this to potential readers. The ironic
complexity of this task, no matter how savvy the reviewer, is best
illustrated when the quality of the work produced by black writers is
measured against that of whites using the criteria of excellence governing
standard English and its genre, Ebonics aside. Ideally, the social context
within which the work under review is created should be factored in, but
should that be done to the exclusion of evaluating the quality of the
writing?


By applying my own standards to Angelou's "Song," my answer was -- and is --
a resounding "NO!"


All literary criticism, at root, is biased because each reviewer must bring
to the act his or her individual world-view and aesthetic sensibility. Each
must decide if the social values of a text as a political record are more
important than its literary values, which is often the choice with books by
African-Americans. But fostering an illusion of excellence where none
exists, regardless of the writer or subject matter, is to do a democratic
readership the ultimate disservice. Saying amen to the going cultural
directives, minus a true analysis, is as morally suspect as any bigoted
criticism -- whether done out of guilt, fear, or the desire to compensate
the author for the social ills that shaped his or her existence. It is with
this understanding that I write whenever I assume the role of reviewer.


In post-9/11 America, where suspicions and the fear of terrorism now
threaten long-coveted individual freedoms, a book review seems rather
insignificant until the twin specters of censorship and oppression are
raised. What keeps our nation great, despite racism, is that some citizens
persist in honoring those freedoms. It is they who allow me to voice my
expertise, be it praise song, mixed bag or dissent.

I thought you were posting the original LAT's review, Tisa.
Yes, this is almost exactly what ran in the Nation.

RICHARD:
I always feel that I am way behind in my knowledge all
round even in the
main stream but I have no doubt that ALL human culture
including "classics"
is of value and if someone is studying classics and
doesnt want to go
"outside maybe that's not good" but its better that
committing crime or
exploiting or bombing people. But I take your quip it
easy for us to revert
by default to "Eurocentric things" and I fell about
that debate.... Roads
lead not to Rome only but constantly in new
directions. Richard Taylor.
(Aotearoa)



LL: Thanks, Richard. It's good to hear this!
I too ALWAYS feel behind...and I was dismissive of the
classics in my university days, but have come back to
them (i love much of the eurocentric canon, but am
drawn to 'tribal' literatures as well)(& the new
electronic work, of course!)===
I was feeling stuffy there for a while about this
thread, afraid the English profs in us all would come
out in hardcore waves, but it's proven much more
interesting than that::::: &&&&& i would love to read
more about NZ, particularly the maori culture, which i
know far too little about, outside of the reading of a
few novels....

yes, nichol has a catullus translation in _as elected_. (interesting to

re-reading Rational Geomancy, and the first third or so of the book
investigates translation as a poetic act, so i've got translation on the

i dunno what y'all are doing but i can get to silliman's blog just fine
from here:

http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com/

blogspot is so heavily used that i find that by the time everyone in
california wakes up, it can be difficult to access those sites.
anyhow, i'd like to number myself among your audience, ron, and to also
mention brandon barr's blog as a good blog about contemporary poetics:

http://cif.rochester.edu/~barr/texturl/

although, like in any decent blog as you note, other subjects get caught up
in the ebb & flow.
i'm hard-pressed to think of any others that deal with poetics at all.
certainly there are a number that engage ideas surrounding digital
textuality (and many of these are linked off brandon's site, so i won't
re-post them here)

and of course there's alienated.net and the york site:
http://www.poetics.yorku.ca/
though there's not much to differentiate them technically from a blog,
neither of these have ever felt particularly bloggish in spirit, lacking
that personal, thinking outloud quality that characterizes much of blog
writing.

there's a certain generosity in blog authorship. makes me want to say
thanks to you.

how does this differ from blogging?  actually I like 'blog' better as a term
as it's a way I can clear out some of the 'fog' that has settled in

As it happens, I am going to Cape Cod for the forst time next week.  Are
there any good bookstores or venues for readings?  I will only be there a
week, near Orleans I think (I am coming along on a trip my mom has planned
with her husband that's why I am geographically vague) but we will have a
car.  My mom likes poetry too and has started to write it again after 30
years (can't vouch for it all though but some is good, just like me I guess
only she doesn't know contemporary poetry at all except for what I show her)
but my step-father might be rather bored at a reading, especially since he
is fairly hard of hearing...

This relates more to the tangent about radical translation. I guess I'm
inclined to disagree with the original proposition that experimental
poetry has become less interested in classical forms and classical
works; I'd say if anything it's the opposite. The current (perhaps
decades-long) moment seems very concerned with translating new thoughts
into old forms or vice-versa. But translating in radical ways, which
seems to me the significant thing.

A couple of examples from Canada (a pseudo-bilingual country where
translation is always a hot theoretical topic) are Lisa Robertson, whose

_XEclogue_ and _Debbie: An Epic_ while not exactly translations are both

playful and carefully theorized abstract reconstructions of Virgil, and
Erin Mouré (or Eirin Moure) who has been working with slightly slanted
translations of Ferdinand Pessoa, as in last year's _Sheep's Vigil by a
Fervent Person_. Mouré, being a translator and a Montrealer, has always
been very aesthetically invested in splipping between languages,  but in

this project - it's really interesting what she's done - it's as if
she's trying to translate not Pessoa's words exactly but his essence,
taking steps such as changing her own name to parallel Pessoa's own
psurfeit of pseudonyms. And _Debbie_ is a great book to read in this
context: aside from being gorgeous, it addresses the various motivations

behind poets' attraction to ancient texts. "Between antiquity and us
floats love in the library" and "I dreamt that Virgil mapped my lavish
sleep / I read the curbs of epic lust's dérive / And there, I saw
myself. // Precocious closure sculpts / Thin difference, thin frock. //
I greet an ornament. Hello shepherdess! Lend me a bit of that stuff.
That fancy stuff. So Virgil, this is how it is."

I'm interested in radical translation because I've been working on a
re-write of The Tale of Genji by Shikibu Murasaki (or perhaps the
causality is the other way around), one in which I try to retell the
story using the idiom of contemporary Japanese English, the kind you
find on packaging and stationery and so on. As far as I can see, both
texts are all about the poetry of sex and therefore seem to deserve to
be introduced. I'm working on this, but whether or not I'm translating
is a matter of opinion because although I do speak Japanese, reading The

Tale of Genji is a different matter entirely, so mainly I'm working with

other English translations. Perhaps I would rather describe it with Erin

Mouré's word trans(e)lation. I like the idea of extracting the happiness

from one text and reproducing it elsewhere. An excerpt of my project
appeared recently in Matrix magazine (Montreal) along with other
explorations of radical translation including an essay by Mouré, English

translations of the Earl of Surrey's Early Modern English sonnets by
Susan Gillis, and an interesting experiment in English-to-English
idiolectical translation between Robin Blaser and Meredith Quartermain.
http://alcor.concordia.ca/~matrix/issue60.html
All relevent to the discussion here, I'd say. (you can read a bit of my
Genji version here: http://members.attcanada.ca/~coreyf/genji.html

        It is misspelled. It is actually to be christian squabblism.
This is found in the poetry of people like Michael Wigglesworth.

Maya Angelou writes crap poetry its like those who are actually ashamed of
being black so they write in a kind of sentimental "poetic" mode: that
pleases the establishment, the (deep down people who tolerate but are
contemptious of blacks etal) and these white-blacks feel they are saying
something that promotes their cause. Its not traitorous or racist to
criticise someone: in this case it needs to be done some stuff is bad
politically and thus poetically.
  Of course this isnt to say that huge numbers of people like it but they
like it for reasons that are complex; not as we (black and white) people who
care deeply about literature and the mind and ultimately about human
beings - in particular as exemplified by "high art" (which can also be
popular art of course: since at least O'Hara (annd maybe we go back to the
1500s or even the Latins and the ancient Greeks such as Apuleius or
Petronius and maybe into other cultures and previous or contemporary (surely
into..) to find the popular and the "high")......
   A counter example in art might be Dondi White the graffitti artist whose
"cliches" were beautiful: there was no attempt to please whitey...he just
painted or "bombed".

              his black delight
              on his parents'
              unaware and
              tolerate roof
              was writ in white

Actually I am aware of some contradictions in what I'm saying eg how do I
say or adjudge that Mills and Boon is worse or of inferior quality than
Faulkner and so on?  But I could (and I believe people do do) a PhD/s on the
subject.

Maybe its not good to criticise other poets as Ron said re McKuen...but I
have only ever glanced at her books which are usually close to Ashbery's in
bookshops or libraries and I used (not nowdays so much) to invariably get
bored with Angelou and pick up John Ashbery. Or move along the shelf to some
new "langpo" or strange poet of interest....

Amiri Baraka (Lee Roi Jones) and even Rita Dove are more interesting.
Richard Taylor (Aotearoa)

PS.September 11 (mentioned in this article) which was a godsend for those
who now can completely expunge human rights and freedom is always referred
to as done by terrorists as if terrorists were always "bad" and what exactly
are they (they can be re proagated as "freedom fighters" and WAS it
terrorists so-called who did the S11 or was it an inside job?) so the
argument gets distorted below: a few thousand are killed measuerd against
the millions killed by capitalism since the turn of the century (and before)
and the thousands dying daily because of the real terrorism of the
capitalists and the especially the US and British military.  Where are the
monuments to be erected to those dying of malnutrition in Iraq, or South
Africa ad Angola, or South America, those exterminated withe help of the CIA
in Indonesia, the death squads organised by the US (using Aussies especially
(and blacks were put in the front line there)) in Vietnam...some moron
sculptor in New Zealand is using a piece of the twin towers as memorial to
the S11 when he ignores the atrocities of the US and British and Israeli
military....pathetic...the working class are not free as a group: blacks may
have more rights than previous to the 1960s but well, I dont know, I'd be
interested in what the working white or black man feels about his so-called
"freedom" in the US or anywhere...

Lewis. Maoritanga and the associated NZ history, like the Australian lore:
its vast and I have only touched the surface of it myself  but want to bring
eg a book by Mr Holloway's wife (who (both) lives near me if  their still
alive and started the Holloway Press which Alan Loney was a
publisher/printer for (Loney is a good poet active in the "experimental"
areas but who did not have a great school education but learnt Greek etc and
studied the classics i think when I was at Auck Uni in 1992 he said he was
learning Greek...so he would understand the references to "strophe" etc he
also published Kendrick Smithyman who rivalled if not surpassed Baxter and
Curnow in ability (well he evolved a different style) but his last work was
predicated on things local and temes from Maoritanga))- into a "work" I'm
doing predcated on my own lief maybee influenced by Zukofsky's "family
based" poetics (or that part of him or his writing).... now its amazing the
number of "ordinary working class people that eg in the 60s helped Mrs
Holloway (wife of Holloway the printer) eg excavate my local ( (I can see it
from here) volcanic cone) where there was a Maori pa and she wrote the book
"Maugarei" fairly sought after....it would be on abebooks..however if I
bring material into a long poem I'm doing (rather desultorily so far or bit
by bit) (modelled maybe somewhat on Patterson) I dont want to do so
artificially...
  Nor is there any need to ignore eg the Greek classics because you want to
talk about the homeless (which since Rogernomics (NZ's Thatcherism or
Reaganism) we have a lot of ..... R A K Mason who became a communist was
greatly steeped in the classics (mind you his poetry, beautiful as it was,
was never  very "modern", how do I put that?..)....but the classics need to
be somewhat demystified (and as I'm now looking into them I find that Ovid
eg was already satirising the Homeric etc) I am enjoying reading Ovid
(Metamorphoses at the now) in the Oxford classics as I'm also studying
Pound's Cantos with a guide by Cookson etc and I have always loved Browning
so he's on my list (of course he's not an ancient! but influenced Pound and
Eliot) but also Williams himself (I think in his prose poem Kora in Hell)
and Creeley and Olson refer to eg Kore in a Creeley poem: but the good thing
was the push by Olson into the South American cultures and David Antin's
talk poem which covered the Australian aboriginees (I think via "Songlines"
by Bruce Chatwin) but I'm not a Uni Professor ( I study on my own mostly)
I'm not in the same realm as Wystan etal but do "clash swords" occasionally
with various of  them: Michelle Leggott's "Dia"  (could refer to the island
of Naxos etc) conflates the various paroles and langues and quotes and is
simultaneously also herself, in NZ: as was Smithyman: but also Alistair
Paterson wrote a poem "Odyseus Rex" which he told me includes his vist to
the Chelsea Hotel in NY so there's a lot going on in NZ: in fact every where
I feel poetry and art are what may save us if we cant rid ourselves of wars
and people like Monsieur Bush and certain "obese" and greedy personages.

There are some highly talented poets and writers in Aotearoa: eg Hone
Tuwhare himself is a Maori (but he was also  a boilermaker and a strong
socialist who is widely read: in both senses!in fact in three senses!) I'm
pleased you expressed an interest in Maoritanga (which is all you need to do
to get into my books! (as , as i say, my own knowledge even of that is
limited greatly) which is more than a lot of Americans (half the senators in
Washington dont have passports - insular to the nth, lost them, confiscated
, scared of flying, dont know how to get them?) mind you we have a lot of
rat bags as well as good people in NZ like anywhere else....

Not having the basic clssical education may ree one into the scientific or
other areas which is good but one misses a lot of marvellous references: so
we need to likk "back" u aslo "out" : look everywhere, be interested in
everything in tis extraordinary world...every moving and sessile thing...

Also I want to peer and Jim Andrews work, and other of the vispos or
whatever they call  themsleves, (and I will time permitting), and I;d love
to be able to translate greek etc like Kent Johnston - who should be on this
poetics list.

Richard Taylor. PS Maori is a beautiful language.   think of the "kowhai
tree (which has yellow flowers and is visited by the Tuis)...but "kowhai
..is pronounced cor -fi  but the ph as in Greek (I believe) is more
aspirated than just the f  (although the spelling of Samoan words with the
f may also be due to the early conventions imposed - not neccessarily with
bad intent - by the missionaries who tranalsated the various Pacific
languages)...

The book you're thinking of, Maria, is _The Formal Field of Kissing_, which
includes Mayer's versions from the classics.  _Sonnets_ is a different book
entirely, none of it translation.

Working mainly from memory here, but Raymond Lull (12th-13th c?) was one =
of the earliest Christian writers to incorporate Kabbalistic ideas into =
his combinatory system.  The biggie though was Johannes Reuchlin, elder =
contemporary of Cornelius Agrippa, who "proved" that it was possible to =
be a Christian and yet use the Kabbalistic system. =20

The Q business, and various Q spellings began to happen in the 18th and =
19th centuries--Saint Germain, Pasqually (sp?), Saint Martin, and more =
recently in the Golden Dawn folks and later incarnations of magickal =
groups.  (Notice the K in magic).  You can find scads of this stuff on =
the net.  Once again, working from memory, but I believe this is all =
sound enough.  Thanks for Geoffrey Gatza's humor and Maria's question, =
now on to the post office before it closes. =20

who identified the Q spellings as Christian spellings in his many books =

I am an assassin-in-servitude. you will get down on my knees. you will
offer yourself to me. everything i do is mine. within the book, the
writing is porous. writing is never linear, never collapses. writing is
communality, whispering everywhere in the world, everyone listening. you
will fabricate your assassin. "My assassin!" he exclaimed. "Think of the
ring of it!" She thought it was fantastic as well, the duplicity of
ownership, as his fabrication moved slowly towards... him. "This is
welcoming news!" she cried. With his last breath, he agreed with her;
Golem or Robot, it was all the same. The book would slowly close, opening
to the world of 9.5 millimeter film - always recognizable by the
sprocket-holes in the middle, between the frames. "Why on earth!?" he
asked. "Because," she replied, "by all accounts, this creates more space
for the image, which can now reach across the entire width of the film;
9.5 millimeter images are close to the size of 16mm itself!" He turned
back towards the Cien Su Vun (Hakka dialect): - the long mistake of the
earth - the surmounting of faith should never be capsized - impossible to
measure the vessel of desire - the net tolls [ ... ] - sad, of sorrow,
sorrowful - Of the Infinite, it matters not. Neither Internal or External.
Of truth, this is what I have constructed: the sphere within the sphere -
both distorted by desire - both convoluted, introverted, partially
collapsed - the nude woman standing by the door, the french apron covering
nothing - tiling everywhere - the enormous stuttered movement of the
camera against the twin cylindrical helices of exfoliating objects - these
objects of faces - these objects - swarms - asteroids - bees - bacteria -
sunshine-avalanches - dusts -"the image worth its obscurity, covered, the
incredible movement of the camera within the spheres, again and again, the
slow breathing of the realm simultaneously open and closed to the world,
anime / anime, deflecting to the Mickey Mouse image stutter through the
1938 Bingoscope 9.5mm hand-cranked projector, inaugural flashlight image
flicker on unplastered wall - wildly movement, the woman caught in
mid-moment, desire, the apron pushed aside - the cause or reaon - ideal or
inspiration - tanach convolution. Now of the assassin - the emptiness of
politics - "I abjure him," she said; "he's got nothing to do with me." For
a moment, I was frightened; surely I'd agree! I did, tearfully, offering a
prayer that he would go away...

He did, bringing an end to the film, early black-and-white Mickey covering
and uncovering an object partially obscured by the deterioration of the
image...

330 Wheeler Hall
Readings begin at 6 pm, Maud Fife Room, 315 Wheeler Hall, UC Berkeley
Free and open to the public

  Joanne Kyger has played a vital role in the American poetry scene for
more than four decades and has been associated with nearly every innovative
poetry tendency during that time, from the San Francisco Renaissance and th=
e
Beats to the postmodern movements of today. One of the major experimenters,
hybridizers, and visionaries of poetry, Kyger is very much a poet of place,
with a sensibility that is delicate, graceful, and never wasteful. Her poem=
s
explore themes of friendship, love, community, and morality, and draw on
Native American sources as well as the path of Buddhist philosophy. Kyger=B9s
love for poetry manifests itself in a grander scheme of
consciousness-expansion and lesson, but always in the realm of the everyday=
.
Her most recent books include P=E1tzcuaro (San Francisco: Blue Millennium,
1999), Some Life (Sausalito: Post-Apollo Press, 2000), Strange Big Moon: Th=
e
Japan and India Journals, 1960-1964 (Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, 2000),
Again (Albuquerque: La Alameda Press, 2001), and the long awaited As Ever:
Selected Poems (Penguin Putnam, 2002).

  Garrett Caples is a poet living in Oakland; The Garrett Caples Reader was
published in 1999 by Black Square Editions and a new chapbook will appear
this fall from Meritage Press.

    Over the years, Robert Grenier has been the inspiration for repeated
rethinkings of what poems are. Working progressively toward a more and more
immediate encounter between word and world, Grenier=B9s work can be seen as a=
n
embodied phenomenology. The philosopher Edmund Husserl was an early
influence, and literary influences have included Robert Creeley (whose
Selected Poems Grenier edited) and Larry Eigner (with whom he worked for
many years). Grenier=B9s published works include Sentences, a box of very
short poems on cards, published by Whale Cloth Press in the early 1970s,
Series (This Press, 1978), Oakland (Tuumba Press, 1980), A Day at the Beach
(Roof, 1984), Phantom Anthems (O Books, 1986), transpiration/transpiring
Minnesota (O Books, 1995).
    Examples of his current work (holograph poems) can best be seen on the

I have a collection of extensive interviews I conducted in Managua
in 1984 and 1985 with leading members of Nicaragua's frustrated
and failed Sandinista Revolution. All of the interviews focus on the
cultural politics of the revolutionary government. Those interviewed
are famed poet Fr. Ernesto Cardenal, Minister of Culture (this was
originally published in my now out of print book of translations, _A
Nation of Poets: Writings From the Poetry Workshops of
Nicaragua_, and will be reprinted at VeRT # 7); Comandante
Tomas Borge, poet and Minister of the Interior (whose selected
writings, translated by me, Russell Bartley, and Sylvia Yoneda,
were published a number of years ago by Curbstone Press); Dr.
Sergio Ramirez Mercado, fiction writer and Vice-President of
Nicaragua; Rosario Murillo, poet, president of the Sandinista
Cultural Workers' Association, and spouse of Comandante Daniel
Ortega, then President of Nicaragua; Comandante Omar Cabezas,
writer and Vice-Minister of the Interior (winner of the Casa de la
Americas Prize, Latin America's most prestigious literary award);
Ramiro Lacayo, Director of INCINE, the Sandinista film institute;
and Julio Valle-Castillo, poet, Vice-Minister of Culture, and
coordinator of the Talleres de Poesia (the national Poetry
Workshop program).

Most of these interviews were published in the 1980's by the
prominent but now defunct Mexican daily _uno mas uno_. The
publication of the Cardenal interview there in the mid-80's sparked a
considerable debate in Mexican literary circles, between writers on
the left (most Mexican writers, at that time, of course), and those
writers grouped around Octavio Paz and his influential magazine
Vuelta. The rest were published (or, in the case of the Borge and
Cardenal, reprinted) in Cuba. A book of the translated interviews
had been accepted for publication and was in progress of being
prepared, but was stalled and never finished for a variety of
reasons.

As a group, these interviews constitute a rare and revealing
document of the Nicaraguan Revolution's cultural ideology and
practice, and the accomplishments and controversies these generated.
All interviews were recorded on (extant) cassette tapes.

If there are 1) libraries that would be interested in acquiring these
documents and tapes, or 2) if there are publishers interested in
printing these interviews as a book, please contact Kent Johnson
at  kjohnson@highland.cc.il.us

Jim. There's some extraordinary stuff on here: it all reminds me of the day
I took of work and went to the Auckland Art gallery and ther was some
strange sculptures that movedand theywere like big machines and ten ther was
a movie of "organic" things, one of the "machines" was called "The Universe"
and  I bought the booklet. I had wandered into the gallery by chance I
think, I cant recall why as I hadnt visited the gallery for years (or
actually read even many books for years) - I was working and my "ambition"
then was just to have a family and a job and a house which I did: but I
think I was beginning to look back to my creative "side" and the artist was
Len Lye: years later I connected with Roger Horrocks who has recently
published a book about him...but at the time the photo-kinetic art was
actually something I had "dreamed of" (literally and conceptually) when I
was about 17 when I had the idea (I must have read about Wagner) of a huge
work that combined a great poem a movie with changiing images and music:now
all this was in about 1963 or 64 but years after here was someone doing what
i had dreamed of (but as i said i'm too lazy to "execute" things)...it was
exciting though to see this stuff (about 1985 by Lye) and this stuff you
have is similarly incredible: I had to do a lot of "downloading' and I kept
geetting 'arrested ' by the computer police - avery frightening eperience -
when I did illegal things: but I could have spent hours on it: I liked that
guy with he cities, and Alan Sondheim etal's thing, the German bloke with
the sea and so on: the idea of a multimedia thing fsacintes me as I dont
separate the arts: poetry is painting is mathematics is music is sculpture
is......I've always believed that: poetry and prose interconnect: everything
interconnects....there is a whole world online and you have some brillliant
conceptual and lit and poetical and artistical and voice and political and
so on work.....i have only seen a small part of the whole site: the city
thing reminded me of an Auckland artist poet/musician/artist Liz Maw who is
(I believe now doing a degreee in art) but she initially turned up to poetry
readings with not  alot of lit knowledge  but an interesting fascination
with cities (which was a change from love temes and poor old me and so on
(not that I am totally against these or so called confessional) its just I
had heard so much of a certain kind of it....and she had (then) maybe still
has I think a unique view of things:and a kind of "lazy" prose style (I like
lazy)..... anyway thanks for the link (links) and I'll "peruse" them more; a
great experience.   Richard Taylor (Aotearoa)

hmmm. do you think the way a word functions *within* a
textual entity is in any way altered by this entity's
genesis (its being a translation, a cut up etc.)?

Of course, our knowledge of a text's genesis (the
processes that led to the text) may enhance the ways
in which we as readers/recipients of the text can
perceive the text. If we know the text is a
translation we may want to look at the original or
other translations.... But does it alter our
perception of the *invididual word* in any meaningful
way?

I also suspect that there is a kind of ownership issue
involved: with a translation many people tend to
continue thinking of the original as the primary text.
Which does not sit well with many poets/artists.
Whereas with much experimental poetry the poet can at
least claim ownership (originality) to the process ...
(I seem to be repeating myself).

Jesse, I believe there is a book out there exploring connections between Bob Dylan's poetry and Kabbalah.  I don't remember the name of it, or the author, but maybe somebody on the list  knows. It's a fascinating well-illustrated book contrasting Dylan's texts with Kabbalah diagrams.

Come and see our new play if you'll be in San Francisco Friday
September 6.  It's at the Lab, 2948 Sixteenth Street at between Capp
and Mission, at 8:00 p.m.  It costs five dollars to get in and you
should call (415) 864-8855 for reservations since we are putting it
on one night only.  It's called FASCINATION.

You'll be watching this play, with its strange echoes of CITIZEN KANE
and THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, and asking yourself, "Wait a second!
Didn't I see this before?"  Sure you did, it's the life of David
Bowie, written up in pageant form by San Francisco writers Kevin
Killian and Wayne Smith.

London . . . the late 60s . . . a group of young UK poets and
musicians rallies around the aging mime maestro Lindsay Kemp, and
from his lab emerges David Bowie, the man who sold the world to storm
London's fickle pop charts.  Next he conquers New York, where his
life is endangered by fanatical fans, and gets jiggy with black soul
music in the Philadelphia of YOUNG AMERICANS.  At his side, his
indomitable soulmate Angie.  The two of them keep inventing
themselves over and over.  Bing Crosby dies.  Marc Bolan sings THE
PRETTIEST STAR.  The ultimate rock couple, Carly Simon and James
Taylor, enters the twisted, androgynous Bowie world and their lives
collapse like those little bags of popcorn.  Then Bowie goes to
Berlin with Brian Eno: heroes, just for one day.

Norma Cole is Nico, Kota Ezawa is Eno, Wayne Smith is James Taylor,
Margaret Crane is Carly Simon, Tanya Hollis is Valerie Solanas, Kevin
Killian is Angie, Cliff Hengst is Iman, Karla Milosevich is Hermione
Farthingale, Scott Hewicker is Tony de Fries, Rex Ray is Lindsay
Kemp, Craig Goodman is Marc Bolan, our large cast also includes Yedda
Morrison, Jocelyn Saidenberg, Brent Cunningham, Gerald Corbin,
Suzanne Stein, Elliot Anderson, Taylor Brady, and Zora Ezawa.

If you're not available on Friday you can come to our dress rehearsal
this Wednesday at 6:30 and see it for free; though it will be a
little discombobulated and the musical numbers won't be "frozen," you
might still enjoy it.  On Wednesday we will try to get out in time to
watch the finale of AMERICAN IDOL (but better tape it just to be on
the safe side).

This performance is presented in conjunction with FASCINATION: THE
BOWIE SHOW, an exhibition at Gallery 16, at 1616 Sixteenth Street
(San Francisco), August 15-Sept 30, call (415) 626-7495 for more
information about the exhibition or visit the website
www.thebowieshow.com.

Thanks everyone.  -- Kevin Killian

Glass and Sondheim are composers.
Other composers by this name
are Glass and Sondheim.
Or Mozart and Salieri
in a stage play, where
no music is heard, but only dialogue.
Also irrefutable:
there are thirty-two letters in the line below
and twelve syllables in the line above.
Daffodils are pretty AND poetic -
and so is Virginia's train.

Translation could perhaps be defined as (one kind of)
a record of interaction: how one poet (e.g. a
translator) interacts with another's text ... the
translation being one record of this interaction.

A cut-up is a different form of interaction with
another text .. often shifting genres (e.g. using an
instruction manual as a source for a poem)((do I mean
catch-up? ketchup? Oh, Heintz!))

Anyway ... the following is pertinent and can be found
in the current issue of jacketmagazine. An
introduction to poems by Ashbery and Kinsella, by the
latter.
B

" The ‘Malley’ poems that come via John Ashbery and
myself, in this selection, are part of a longer
work-in-progress that will be released by Fremantle
Arts Centre Press in book form. My texts derive from
‘starting points’ within Malley poems and / or the
original texts that the deadly duo — McAuley and
Stewart — ravaged for words / ideas, their own
‘starting points’. Various living authors are alluded
to or sublimated.
      At the time of writing one or two of these, John
Ashbery had faxed through to me a couple of his pieces
— there may consequently be a sense of ‘response’ in
one or two of my poems included here. There is most
certainly a dialogue in all of the pieces with John
Ashbery's ‘voice’. I also have a number of letters and
emails from that inception period (a couple of years
ago) to ‘deflect’ from John’s take on this discovery
that Ern sought to speak through us. I am not sure why
this happened, but maybe we’re both receptive to
Ern-like poets struggling to be heard from across the
great divide. I know I spend my time listening closely
for such voices from limbo."

I'm surprised how few people have responded to this post.  I suspect that
it's a difficult and/or embarrassing question for many: difficult, because
it requires us as poets to be self-critical about an activity that is often
performed at an extreme distance from the self; embarrassing, because in
some cases one discovers that the uncritical mental blur which can be
achieved in that distancing is one of the guilty rewards of writing poetry
in the first place.

I'm not implying that "good poets" are constantly keeping open one
analytical eye on their work whereas "bad poets" just go into a solipsistic
Ionic ecstasy.  This may be the case in a limited way, but it's more
complicated than that.  For one thing, it may be necessary for some poets t=
o
have an extended "uncritical" phase in which they simply *produce*, in orde=
r
to get the machinery warmed up, receive external diagnoses, learn from thei=
r
own tea-leaf leavings, etc.  For another, even with poets who go through
phases of this sort and then become more theoretical, programmatic, or
"professional" (as if there were a profession involved) about their work,
there may be a conscious decision to revert to the earlier state of
autopermissive praxis.  Granted, in this case, the "uncritical" nature of
the praxis is always already critical by virtue of being chosen in reaction
to a preceding period of intellectualization, since the choice in question
is a choice to test the limits of some findings arrived at in the prior
mode.  This all may be getting at part of what is meant by "experimental"
poetry.

In my case, I can say that my own work seems to be in the throes of a
transition: from a period of intuitive, transrational lyricism with a
(typically postmodern) tendency to interpolate bits and pieces of found
discourse, either whole or distorted, to a period of heavily rule-based
assemblage, using principles of collage to work backward from the earlier
method, attempting to simulate lyricism (or its related effects, such as
antilyricism, metalyricism, paralyricism, 'patalyricism, FlaRf,
turaluralyricism, etc.) via the manipulation of found materials.  One of th=
e
things I find interesting about this approach is that the results seem to m=
e
more often to approximate a "unified" poetic "voice" (such terms have becom=
e
so ironized for me that the quotation marks here are enclosing other,
multiple sets of *implied* quotation marks) than much of the earlier, wholl=
y
"authorial" work.  This is undoubtedly because the manipulation of the
materials tends to promote the privileging of certain strongly discursive
markers: pronouns, deictics, assertions of identity, etc.  Very frequently,
the work produced is predominantly "funny" or "satiric" as in the following=
:


"NOT A WAR BLOG"


Fisto: boy I would like to find you deer
Mr. Lamp: SHE GOOD LOOKING GYP TOO
     HELL OF HEAD
Fisto: Damn skippy!
Mr. Lamp: Damn skippy
Fisto: I think I had that deer frozen
Mr. Lamp: you may of hit the nail on the head
Fisto: doctor :-) I have a bad head
Mr. Lamp: why do they insist on
     these wicker deer that they put up in their lobby
Fisto: you should know cuty
[looks up from a hideous parody of a deer]
Mr. Lamp: giant oil companies behind this
     Bush scared me, because he always
     sniffs at the air like a deer
Fisto: this is not a war blog - it's just MY blog
     all I wanted to do was to set my head
     as to whom would attend
     to a wounded deer and, of course,
     take a shit near Balboa BART
Mr. Lamp: I wish I understood that sentence
Fisto: a challenge, that's for sure: you'd need a head
     if the deer are all armored like that
     It's almost like the deer is sporting an M16
[head honcho in the Jewish Federation
Drops his spoon and grasps his head:: ugh
ate to much) ::scents a deer
leaps onto the naked girl]
Mr. Lamp: I held it together until the scene
     where he bites the head off the deer
=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0"THAT'S JERRY'S HEAD!"
     "Damn skippy, bi**tch."
     all the while Jeff Goldblum was rambling
     "I DON'T DO NEEDLES"
     Nocturna he knew would be running around killing deer
     "god made elk, god made deer, god demonstrated
     the dry-scrape method of brain tanning deer"
Fisto: if i here music in my head
     well taken Smokey:
     "The truck piss-a-deer-ed." Hehehe!
     they're damn skippy it's an artificial flavor
Mr. Lamp: hope you enjoy reading what goes through my head
     too bad I didn't see any 3-headed deer, though
     and the bats started chasing Old School Scotty's head


-----------------------

So I guess, to sum up, my work at the present time is concerned with
assemblage, lyricism, and deer heads.  And maintaining a balance (dirty
compromise?) between clearly defined process and creative anarchy.

Sorry to bother you all.

I am starting to put together a DIY book tour of sorts
in support of my first book, GIVEN, coming out this
November from Verse Press, for which it was a finalist
in a contest judged by Lyn Heijinian.  As I am rather
new at all this, I am going to be bold here.  I love
giving readings and talking about poetry (and will be
speaking about my aesthetic theory of contemporary
innovative women's poetics, the Gurlesque, at Small
Press Traffic in November.  I am also very happy to
travel, so I am offering myself up as a potential
reader in Winter/Spring 2003 for those of you
interested. Jean Valentine, Laura Mullen and C.S.
Giscombe have all said very nice things about the
book.  Samples of my work and biographical info
certainly available.  Please backchannel.  Thanks so
much.

Theory into Practice: Two Evenings
of Readings at Modern Times Bookstore

7:30pm Friday, Sept. 20 and Friday, Sept. 27

This group of poets of wildly divergent backgrounds, ages, and styles
has one thing in common -- all have been studying with local Beat icon
Diane di Prima in an advanced writing workshop. They also have
something for everyone -- with humor, nuance, and attention to form
they'll share the results of poetic experiments and life experiences.
With publications in a wide range of national magazines including
Skanky Possum, the Paterson Literary Review, and First Intensity,
among many others, these poets promise to thrill and delight while
putting into practice the theories they've learned in class.

Friday, September 20:

Pam Lanza
Jo Kaufman
Joyce Brady
Timotha Doane

Friday, September 27:

Marcene Gandolfino
Jeanne Brondino
Elizabeth Gjelten
David Hadbawnik

        Pamela Lanza is an artist and art insturctor currently teaching at
the Art Institute and UC Extension. She is returning to poetry after
having published sa few works in some renegade broadsides and literary
magazines in the 70's at Agnes Scott College and Georgia State
University in the 70's. Her poetry is often incorporated into her
mixed media artworks, and will appear in upcoming issues of the
Paterson Literary Reviw and the Peace Project due out in 2003.

Jo Kaufman is San Francisco based writer, teacher and mother of two
(suddenly surly) adolescent children.  She received her Master of Fine
Arts in Creative Writing from USF and her work has appeared in the
Santa Clara Review, the Patterson Literary Review, along with various
small local presses.  She is currently working on book-length work of
creative non-fiction.
Joyce Brady is a teacher at City College of San Francisco, a poet and
photographer. Her work has been published in Writing for Our Lives,
Crone Chronicles, Spiritual Eldering, The Circle Continues, and The
Four Faces of Women. She facilitates "circles of wise women" using
poetry and symbolism as vehicles to cultivate a remembrance of Self.
She has studied with Diane di Prima for two years.
Timotha Doane was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, Vernal Equinox,1944.
She grew up in Connecticut on land where her father's family has been
farming and squatting since 1630. These facts illumine a life of
activism.  Poetry is magic ritual politics love dictation. Timotha
teaches American English to speakers of other languages at City
College. She is a practitioner of the way of Hekate and Vajrayana
Buddhism.
        Jeanne Brondino has studied poetry with Diane di Prima for four
years. She is acquisitions editor for Hunter House Publishers, a
self-help health publisher, sings and drums with a Qawwali (Sufi
music) group, and lives in Alameda at the edge of a bird sanctuary.
She considers herself a new poet.

        Elizabeth Gjelten is a poet, performer and playwright
        who has presented her solo and duet theater pieces at
        the Working Women Festival (at il Teatro 450), Venue
        9, Z Space, the Marsh, and Life on the Water. She was
        a member for several years of the Z Space Studio
        Artists in Residence Program. She is in the graduate
        playwriting program at SF State.

David Hadbawnik is a poet and performer who has published work in
Skanky Possum, -Vert, Cauldron & Net, Electronic Poetry Review,
Jacket, and Boog City, among others. He has collaborated with several
movement, performance, and music-based artists, and also publishes
Habenicht Press.

All,

I was just wondering if anyone's going to New York for MLA this
december, or who might be there at that time for something else, or
who might know of literary things going on at that time.

Maybe we could all meet at a hotel bar and throw pretzels at people?

I just wanted to report that within hours of my
posting looking for places to give readings, I
received many warm, helpful responses and offers.  I
am deeply encouraged and profoundly grateful.  I know
the list can be annoying at times, but it is also an
invaluable resource, and man, am I glad I have you
guys for a community! (Hats off too to Christopher
Alexander and the rest of the poetics crew for keeping
it running so smoothly.)

Namaste,
Arielle

 I like this question. I'm interested in hearing responses from others but
here is something from me. First of all, I'm not writing poetry all the
time, although it is fair to say writing it is always on my mind.
Second, I'm a writer first and a poet second, but what I mean by writing may
be what other besides myself mean by poetry. I write criticism, art
criticism more than literary criticism. My writing found its direction I
believe in my efforts in the 1970s to write about performance art. Since
then all the writing genres have had for me a necessary instability.
Especially poetry. Third, I don't do, have never done, one-off poems. Each
piece is part of a project, call it a book. I have several of these on the
go at any one time. Some have been on the go for a decade or more, slowly.
Sometimes having poetry on my mind is looking for material, sometimes it is
thinking about method, but this is also true of all the writing.

Subject: A Question of Scope


I would be interested in hearing about how various
individuals on this list perceive their own work, with
reference to scope and definition (of projects,
processes and the like). As is evident from the most
recent twenty or perhaps even forty years, many
writers conceive of their work as "one big thing,"
process-based, and so forth. At the same time, this is
likely not to be true for everyone assembled here.
Despite what may be a disinclination for some to
consider writing to be product-oriented, I am
interested in how various people would describe their
concept of the work that they are doing.

The question emerges on the heels of the recent (and
perhaps current) discussion about posting, posting
poetry, venues for publishing, and the like.

Laynie Browne & Leslie Scalapino: reading at Small Press Traffic

on Friday, September 13, 2002, 7:30 PM.CCAC at 1111 Eighth St.,

San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th & Wisconsin).

Poet, prose, and hybrid genre writer Laynie Browne has two new books =
this year,

Acts of Levitation (Spuyten Duyvil) and Pollen Memory (Tender Buttons) . =
A former curator at the Ear Inn in NYC and Subtext in Seattle, Browne's =
work was included in Poet's Choice, edited by Robert Hass, and she is a =
past winner of the Gertrude Stein Award in Innovative American =
Literature. Her previous books include The Rebecca Letters (Kelsey St., =
1997) and The Agency of Wind, Avec, 1999), of which Rain Taxi magazine =
said "the surrealism is distinctly latter day." Born in 1966 and raised =
in Los Angeles, Browne recently moved to Oakland.

                A renowned language pioneer, Leslie Scalapino's new book =
is It's go in/quiet illumined grass/land, a long poem from Sausalito's =
Post Apollo Press. Other recent books include The Tango (Granary Books), =
a reprint of her novel, Defoe (Green Integer), and a poetic mystery =
novel, Orchid Jetsam (Tuumba). Alice Notley says of Scalapino's latest =
book: "An enlightened work singing of death, physical pain, social =
fearlessness, and where when or whether one is. The intricate variable =
stanza, almost danced (like a Greek strophe) sounds one of Scalapino's =
favorite themes: inside and outside, the cruelty outside and the =
illumination also there, as in here, in space and in time. The stanza =
leads one through the space and time of the poem word by word. You can't =
stop."=20

Usually, when the public is educated about poetry, the focus is on
individual poets, on history, not on the poetic point of view. Whenever you
want to date it from, the contemporary poetic point of view, and I do think
there is one, is just this: a desire to draw back the curtains of the
accepted, the "normal" view of reality, and see beneath, or beyond it. This
is because, for example, this normal view of reality accepts, and has long
accepted, mechanically amplified violence as an unavoidable necessity, a
means to an end. This normal view accepts the erosion of the validity of the
individual voice, presenting as forceful or even radical the revelation of
some individual voices, as if this were the personification of freedom of
speech, a kind of "representative democracy." Clearly, "representative
democracy" is easily converted, or perverted, into a way of silencing
dissent by distorting its edges into some recognizable, received truths,
accepted and acceptable points of view, recognizable and understandably
rational viewpoints, presented as a serial chorus of inspired, enlightened,
witty voices. The poetic point of view will eventually manifest itself in
totalitarian situations like our own, where focused dissent is manipulated
into silence through the creation of robotic bureaucracies, whether
governmental, corporate, educational or in the culture industry, whose
covert function is to crush any and all manifestations of a socially
powerful transformative imagination. Like a restless rhythm or figure that
slips quietly into unconscious circuits, the neural pathways of human
experience, poetic truth will assert itself, if and only if, if and only
when we poets look and listen long to each others spirits, recognize what we
have seen in each of ourselves and speak as one.

Hey Kasey---

glad to see your take on this....it "ups the ante" as they sey----
I like, and in some ways identify with, your formulation of critical and
uncritical "phases"--
it's one way of framing a kind of "back and forth" (or dialectic? or dialogic?
or trialogic, which is a word that, though of limited use, i prefer to
"polyvocal")....

I like the way you apply this to a sense of a transition (or transitions) you
find yourself going through now, as you describe:

"from a period of intuitive, transrational lyricism with a
(typically postmodern) tendency to interpolate bits and pieces of found
discourse, either whole or distorted, to a period of heavily rule-based
assemblage, using principles of collage to work backward from the earlier
method, attempting to simulate lyricism (or its related effects, such as
antilyricism, metalyricism, paralyricism, 'patalyricism, FlaRf,
turaluralyricism, etc.) via the manipulation of found materials.


I tend to identify personally at present much more with the former mode which
you claim you are currently largely eschewing, though by saying that I don't
mean to sound dogmatic like I'm not into understanding your motives for making
the change to things like Flarf---
no point not being permissive of it, although I would defend the former mode as
no more
"typically postmodern" than the latter idea of "rule-based
assemblage"---regardless of whether "post-modern" is a pejorative term. Anyway,
not to over-quibble on semantics.

For me, personally, my personal distrust of engaging further in the practice of
things like
farf or flarf or magnetic poetry board poems (which I keep telling myself I'll
do someday...), or why I never accorded Berrigan's "sonnets" the same reverence
many others seem to, I think relates to several things. 1) that I'm into that
intuitive, I'd add improvisatory sense of "thinking in the poem," that
discursive lyric or lyrical discursiveness I found more in your "earlier"
poems---I like the sense of reading somebody who seems to be trying to figure
things out in their poems, rather than primarily presenting a sculpted
"believable self" on one hand (though I do that at times---more on that
below...) or what I think you mean by "rule-based assemblage" on the other. 2)
the second reason, and I know some would throw this out of court as merely
personal, etc., but it's something I think worth talking about---even if my
particular momentarily absolute (read: tentative) conclusions about it are
something you'd disagree with (I welcome such disagreements), relates to
lifestyle---the idea that I keep telling myself that such a flarf mode in its
very playful game-aestehticism could be an interesting thing/option for me to
engage more fully in...someday, like SAY when I find myself once again having
less time for writing relentlessness, due to job situations, or other social
commitments, like say a love-relationship, or due to health reasons, like maybe
if I choose to quit, or cut down on, smoking (and, yes, for me, smoking has
been integrally involved with writing)or drinking coffee. Anyway, I'm putting
it off, and may not even really move into a more flarf like mode if I quit
cigs, but this be part of the "politics of poetic form" for me--

But rather than dwell on what I'm not doing I think I could at least briefly
and reductively comment on a little of the transition I've been going through
the past few months....
After finishing 2 full length manuscripts of poetry (still trying to find
publishers), I felt like I had enough for awhile---not so much of writing
poetry (though that has diminished) as of
working on it, revising it (a 3000 mile move too emphasized the need for some
kind of transition too)---but since I had to do something in the meantime while
I'm waiting for my new social and chthonic (sp?) environment to assert itself
of me--and the two forms that have asserted themselves most for me are 1) more
"journal like" prose (not too dissimular from what this post is threatening to
become!),and 2) finally getting around to putting lyrics to melodies/songs I
had made up in some cases 14 or 15 years ago.....These two forms
kind of have a way of making what I called poetry previously seem sort of what
Dickinson would call "the term between"---or the excluded middle, and it's
fascinating for me to try to "dumb myself" down into the form of quatrains and
rhymes and repetition and the three dimsensionality of the way the word floats
in music---not that I'd claim any Dylan status for my songs as of yet, but I am
pretty proud of having finished an album's worth of song material in the last
several months after years of always coming up against a wall there....
Anyway, there's something so apollonion, so essentialist in the song-lyric "i"
that comes through that probably needs the counter-weight of more blatant prose
ruminations (while my poetry was kind of in between); it's like discovering a
new triad. The fact that I've also suspended writing reviews/essays on poets
and no longer am working on a dissertation maybe has belatedly freed me up to
do this (for I'd say much of my earlier poetry was very much in dialogue with
my Ph.D. dissertation in ways I've only begun to explore....)

Anyway, it's more complex than this (and may involve that "parenthetical
pantheism" to which I referred in an earlier post on this subject), but I just
thought I'd share some of this
as maybe a response to SM and you....

take care,

Chris

That makes my day, Richard, what you wrote about your the intertwining of your dreams and
imaginings and multimedia work you experienced after the fact. I remember, about a year ago,
when I woke up one morning and had the opportunity to sleep in, that I daydreamed/dreamed of an
imaginary literary machine that travelled about inside the head in deep space, and it was a
visual poetry machine, bright and fantastic, that lit up the space around it and, though it was
impossible to really figure out the language that it was producing and giving off like fire and
rainbows--the language would stream and explode from it ever so beautifully gracefully and then
disappear after a certain radius--nonetheless it did seem to be about language and the inner
word, the letter, a kind of poetry of the letter, of the inside of letters and language, perhaps
microscopic poetry or something, and the machine did have a metal exterior, but you know how
metal and light can be if the metal is brushed, or there's a range of metals, brushed and
tarnished, rusted and all the range of color and texture that metal is capable of and also how
it reflects light; anyway, there it was, and slowly drifted away into space.

I also appreciated what you said about not separating the arts. That's how I feel, too.

Will be moving the day after tomorrow several thousand miles to the east coast (Toronto) for six
months, so my e will be xed for a few days.

Hi Wystan,

this would be closer to my own sense of practice. I have a writing practice.
I write projects, pieces and they are rarely what others would call poems,
although that has happened. I try to make pieces as distinctive as possible.
Recently this has been achieved through intimate bodies of work in
collaboration, through which conversations inflect a gradually unfolding and
generative body of writing that i cannot claim as mine.

I also publish barely the tip of what i might. Books have been finished for
years but are fiddled with instead of getting them out of the house. I've
always only responded to invitation, never cold-called a publisher. As less
books are viable (particularly in the UK  -  and folks such as SPD are kind
of useless for UK publishers on the whole) i just have projects gathering
dust. There used to be an outlet through readings at least, but . .

Much of what i work is conceived of as a book. I format it, typeset it and
these performances of design are part and parcel of the writing.

love and love
cris

I think for most of the best poets it's more because the normal view of
reality is boring.

Cris and the listers:  wsytan has at least two books and I have two of them
(i'd like to purchase any others wystan when i'm sufficiently fiscal, i have
a cancer day book and the small book which is so small i've mislaid it
somewhere so i might buy another copy of that! but certainly interested in
any other books you do) and his  description of an "event" at an abandoned
gass works is incredible: and also "the cancer day book" may be one of those
rare books of poetry (a text a kind of mantra?) that
that despite its writerly intentions has become very readerly...

(it starts)      there's no humour
                   in       a     tumour

(true but one cant help smiling wrly)

its based on wystan's own experience with cancer in the 80s : early this
year my sister told us she had cancer: similar to wystan's ...now the tumour
was removed and i sent some quotes from it to gillian (who is interested in
practical arts more than poetry) but eventually i took the book to her and
she found that the i think her words were   "wystan's irreverent poems are
somehow" [more comforting than a lot of the clap trap and other cliches and
'assurances' and so on she had received (no doubt all of it well meant)] and
so that book was/is both of value in its import and the "artistic'' or
literary design and also "inspiring":
(my sister copied parts she liked out and i think this has helpped her
somewhat through a terrible and frighteing time and also now the
chemotherapy period....

an example of the different ways that poetry is received. the other book by
wystan is also quite excellent (if unfortunately for me now too small!!)
with eceptively minimal prose-ic lines contrasting with more "lyical'
although the style is mostly "matter of  fact" a interesting book:

one page has:            My out look is your look out.

and from memory there's another page with:

             Inside North Head dug they all night for magma;
             Oustide eyesight spurted all over.

but i'm not sure of this quote: but wystan also has a project elated to
gathering art references and places and things named after or by artists and
others in creative fields.

I am moving in the direction of "projects rather than poems as such but I
have written many - many that i had no idea what they were about: but i
would "seize" a idea quickly and for many of those poems that gradually
became shorter then i did my "prose' of "block" poems but i found this too
easy or I didnt know WHY i was doing what i was doing: after all those poems
i could write often very rapidly and endlessly: some were good, a lot just
"tangled"....i like the idea of a projectural thing: but those projects i
have similarly there is less deire to publish them, as ijsut like writing
something i (one of tem ) now and then .... my intention is to make own
books even if  i just do 20 copies or less of each project. and give them to
people i know will be interested.  that's enough for me: i am relatively
indifferent to being published per se: after all if my poems aer "bad" why
should  i publish them? in fact how do i know if anyone will be interested?
maybe there is so much poetry - too much? (rhetorical questions) mind you i
have decied to decided the odd poem off and Poetry NZ  is publishing one of
my poems  but i wouldnt want to simply continue with that .... also i'm
rather busy tring to make ends meet as they say so maybe i'm a bit
jaded.....

But one thing: i dont think that whether one erson reasds oneof my poems or
no one does is relevant: there's a lot of head counting andname dropping.
most people dont care about poetry or poets: but it is still a vital proces
or activity: but counting how many reads is futile. its the making  that
counts. some thouhgts of an old caste-iron head ...

Tony. Dont make yourself annoyed: life's to short. I'm very happy. It doesnt
matter who reads what. On the List anyone in God's Universe including the
CIA and the KGB are probably listening or reading in: but most people are
indifferent to anything and evrything  i say so doubt they care what  your
thoughts were whatever: if it comes to that i have probably some pretty
mixed up rhetoric flying around: poets as a group are by job description and
requirement a bit cracked as a general rule: but you and i are ok we know
the yanks blew up the towers...well i do anycase: bush planned it...or maybe
a group of arabs and jews and some  big time capitalists and some white
supremacists with soe of the blly graham lot thrown in and maybe they used
soe nutters but i think te biggest nutters ae in washingtonin the capitol
and the pentagon!!... with the super right: cash talks: but it looks as
though the bush baby is not gunna get his little warrikins! i think everyone
wants to "get real" and start living again and selling things: i hope so
anyway as i need US cash becasue kiwis are all too poor .....i'm looking
foreward to this week as  i want to video the "little holocaust" they had in
New York...it sure made for f***n good televsion!!!   nearly as good as the
real thing!!! and it was on all day with no adverts! mavellous! better than
those veetnam movies or pulp fiction

but to "unenlist" so to speak you go onto the epc site and click some
buttons: but stay on: dont worry about mr tom bell he's a headshrinker i
think: as i say most people just dont give a damn what anyone else says...

i remember this old pommy boss i had who used to say: "In Russia you're shot
if you express your opinions, but in the US you can say anything you like
because nobody ever listens!"

Sheila (with an E.) Murphy's question to us all:

<I would be interested in hearing about how various individuals on this
list perceive their own work, with reference to scope and definition (of
projects, processes and the like).>

This is quite the opportunity. How do I perceive my work? And might I
perceive it as =93one big thing?=94 It is two things you're asking, I'm th=
inking:
1) the writing of poetry, and 2) the making of poems. The writing of
poetry is the investigation of the one big thing that is out there (uni-
verse, as they say). But the poems are individual projects toward
getting it right. Or maybe projects of chipping away at the numinous.
(And fragments is what you get for that, I=92m finding. Alas. [So no "one
big thing" for me.])

As a practice then, writing poetry is a method of not being dead. Or,
more accurately, to have a record of being alive. Of having been here,
done something. Toward this, I keep little notebooks within which I
write phrases I hear (or imagine, who knows) while going through the
day. Occasionally, I go to a computer with my notebook(s), and start
flipping. Something then comes of it. Overheard phrases are steeped
in a specific place and voice and then I recontextualize them in ways I
find musically pleasing. And I hope, as well, they are a way of getting
outside of my claustrophobic plights. Of adding layers of tone. And,
hopefully, a larger humanity. Maybe it's a more mediated version of cut
ups? I haven't really thought of them that way before.

The poems, though, are individual voices in the choir. Little products.
Occasional poems. I suppose the closest I=92ve come, in my mind (and
who is ever anything other than wrong when thinking of oneself?), to the
poetry of one big thing, is a series of poems (I=92ve got 150 of the
buggers so far) sharing the partial title =93A Guidebook to=94 with, then,=

specific additions that I try to evade for the rest of the poem. Examples:=

=93A Guidebook to the Afterlife=94 =93A Guidebook to Patch of Ground
People=94. But the only alike I think they have is style . . . and a sort =
of
narrative evasion. Which I suppose becomes their theme? I thought
the 21st century could use some guidebooks is all, and that poetry
would be a perfectly unhelpful form for them to take. Getting the news
from poetry, that sort of thing.

This isn=92t much of a response, I know. I=92d be more thoughtful if I wer=
e
someone else, I=92m sure. I promise, in fact.

Best,
  JG

NEWS RELEASE
Release: No. DITA-81

Date Mailed: August, 30, 2002
For Immediate Release
Contact: Elaine Zacky-208/265-2575; 800/336-9266

Investigators Conclude Russian Defector is Lead Suspect in Anthrax Mailings
Case

Sandpoint, ID- Three veteran investigators have independently narrowed the
field of anthrax mailings suspects to a single Russian defector affiliated
with two heavily implicated defense contractors and the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA).

Kanatjan Alibekov, alias "Ken Alibek," the President of Hadron Advanced
Biosystems, should be re-interrogated by the FBI, according to three
researchers who arrived at this conclusion independently. They say Stephen
Hatfill-the military virologist cited by FBI officials in recent weeks as a
chief subject was not likely involved in the mailings at all.

The three men include: Dr. Leonard G. Horowitz-a public health and emerging
diseases expert, Michael Ruppert-a retired Los Angeles Police Department
narcotics detective, and Stewart Webb-a federal whistle blower credited with
supplying key evidence to federal prosecutors during the 1989 Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) scandal. All three investigators say substantial
evidence implicates Dr. Alibekov and the parties he served before and during
the anthrax mailings, including the CIA. This, they propose, might best
explain why the FBI's inquiry has floundered.

Their compiled evidence is largely public knowledge. Dr. Alibekov was the
first Deputy Director of Biopreparat-the Soviet Union's leading biological
weapons testing center. He oversaw military anthrax production for nearly 20
years, and was personally responsible for 32,000 employees at 40 facilities
when he suddenly defected to the United States in 1992 to begin working for
the CIA. According to interviews, Dr. Alibekov allegedly defected to help
stop the biological weapons race, not for monetary reward. Yet, his
activities in America indicate otherwise.

On May 20, 1998 Dr. Alibekov testified before the Joint Economic Committee
of the U.S. Congress as a Program Manager for the Battelle Memorial
Institute (BMI)-a leading military contractor and one of few institutional
suspects identified by the press. William Broad of the New York Times (Dec.
13, 2001), upon Dr. Horowitz's earlier urging, cited BMI as the chief CIA
contractor for project "Clearvision"-an effort to produce the deadliest Ames
strain anthrax ever developed. It was hyper-concentrated, silica-laced,
electro-magnetized, and extremely transmissible. The facts indicate Dr.
Alibekov, one of two leading anthrax experts contracted by the CIA at the
time of "Clearvision," may have managed the entire program during which the
germ was sent from BMI to the BMI administered and supplied Dugway Proving
Grounds in Utah. From here or BMI's anthrax lab in West Jefferson, Ohio, the
never-before-seen anthrax weapon was transferred to envelopes and mailed
from four locations including Trenton, N.J. and St. Petersburg, FL in early
October, 2001. The mailings killed five people while scores of others were
victimized by the ensuing fright and toxic side effects from taking
CIPRO-the "anthrax antibiotic," according to experts and news reports.

More suspicious ties to the Russian defector and Hadron Advanced Biosystems
were realized when investigators learned of the second leading BMI and CIA
anthrax contractor, and close personal friend of Dr. Alibekov, Dr. William
C. Patrick, III. Suspiciously, Dr. Alibekov and BMI had contracted with this
anthrax ace in the Spring of 1998 to predict the dispersal and damage
capability of mailing such a hyper-weaponized germ much like the one sent to
select members of the media and legislators on Capitol Hill. Evidence
indicates Dr. Patrick, who holds several secret patents on America's anthrax
weapons, worked closely with Dr. Alibekov in developing the anthrax that was
mailed.

The three independent investigators each cite economic and political motives
for the targeted anthrax mailings. Given the high grade and technical
difficulty in producing and handling this grade of anthrax, they reasoned,
"white collar criminals" with access to military or pharmaceutical labs most
likely acted on behalf of those who benefited most from the attacks and
ensuing fright. Hadron, DynCorp, and BMI lead the pack of corporate and
institutional suspects, the investigators say. A revelatory organizational
chart prepared by Dr. Horowitz depicting the leading corporate and
institutional suspects was mailed to more than 1,500 FBI agents late last
year along with an extensive 25-page report still available over the
Internet (link to
http://www.tetrahedron.org/articles/anthrax/anthrax_espionage.html)

Logically, the three investigators reasoned, the media was initially
targeted to sway public opinion in support of government orders worth
billions of dollars for hyped vaccines and drugs, much of which benefited
Hadron, DynCorp, BMI and their directors and contractors. DynCorp was the
major military and intelligence provider awarded $322 million to develop,
produce, and store anthrax and smallpox vaccines for the nation. BMI, a
leading defense and energy industry contractor, directed the US military's
Joint Vaccine Acquisitions Program. Bioport, LLC became a leading
beneficiary. This British-controlled anthrax vaccine maker in Lansing,
Michigan was sanctioned repeatedly by federal officials and members of
congress for unethical business practices, violating health and safety
guidelines, and vaccine contaminations that some researchers say may have
triggered the mysterious Gulf War illness.

Corporate profiteering was firmly secured after the mailings to Capitol
Hill, the investigators say. The specific targeting of Senators Patrick
Leahy (D-Vt.) and Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), traditionally strong
drug and military industry adversaries, reinforced their suspicions.

Dr. Horowitz had been studying anthrax advances since 1989. He correctly
diagnosed "the beginning of the anthrax scam" one week before the first
mailings were heralded by the media. FBI records show he urged the bureau to
begin their ongoing investigation into anthrax-related bioterrorism on
October 1, 2001. It took bureau officials six months to finally respond to
his repeated urgent correspondence. "Then, rather than expressing gratitude
and following my leads," he said, "my two interrogators were primed to make
me a suspect." For this reason, Horowitz says, he can "feel for the plight
of the bureau's scapegoat"-Dr. Steven Hatfill.

Detective Ruppert, collaborating with investigative journalist Michael
Davidson, followed their suspicions to Hadron and DynCorp through court
records pertaining to a secret pirated military software program called
PROMIS. They learned that Dr. Alibekov's predecessor-Hadron's past director
and founder, Dr. Earl Brian-a business associate of former Reagan
administration Attorney General Edwin Meese-was convicted of fraud during
the 1980s.

"Dr. Alibekov's interrogation and lie detection at Hadron's Advanced
Biosystems," Ruppert advised, "may not only solve the anthrax mailings
mystery, but also shed light on the recent untimely and inexplicable deaths
of several biological weapons experts including Dr. Alibekov's former boss,
Dr. Vladimir Pasechnik." Dr. Pasechnik-the Soviet Union's top biological
weapons director-was most likely murdered, according to Ruppert and
Davidson. His demise immediately followed his volunteering to help solve the
anthrax mailings mystery.

Dr. Pasechnik defected to Great Britain three years before Dr. Alibekov
defected to America, Mr. Ruppert recalled. Pasechnik abandoned his work in
biological weapons development. Dr. Alibekov, contrary to his stated reason
for defecting, continued to work in this field. Pasechnik's death, according
to British intelligence officer Christopher Davis, was reportedly due to a
stroke. Ruppert and Davidson remain unconvinced.

Stuart Webb has spent more than twenty years investigating "white collar
crime" at the highest levels of government. His intelligence sources and
leads have proven accurate a number of times, helping justice department
officials indict suspects ranging from bankers to drug dealers. He also
believes evidence in the anthrax mailings case implicates key CIA and Bush
administration officials. For this reason, he says, the crime is unlikely to
be solved by the FBI.

"One of my sources, a high ranking intelligence officer, confirmed Dr.
Horowitz's conclusion," he said. Hadron and "Dr. Alibek" in particular, are
"most heavily implicated as agents for this anthrax devil-doing."

The circus got boring as well with creaming and whirling
He savored its bowels like a sponge rag
The planks of corset are sawn, the lame lioness is mooing

Green rubbish flying in the air
 Like a little sardine from a SUICIDED COCK
 KRA-ASH!

I believe I would have nice things to say, too.  Arielle's poetry melts me.
I can't wait to see it in a book.

Top Ten Reasons Orpheus Looked Back

10. He wanted to blindly embrace her because love is blind
 9. He was worried about her
 8. He thought she wasn't really there
 7. He secretly hated her
 6. He secretly hated all women
 5. He had fallen in love with Persephone
 4. He thought he'd heard someone else wanting to
    congratulate him for a successful poetry reading
 3. He knew paganism had to be overtaken by Christianity
 2. The disobeying self = the self
 1. He wanted to know *why* he shouldn't look back . . .

I'm late for the movie discussion, but I highly recommend "The Anniversary
Party" -- sparkling dialog, a veritable Wilde.

Speaking of dialog, "Magnolia" still entrances me, but I'll bet that's too
mainstream for a lotta y'all.

Also, I'm curious what the best way to get rejected is.  Do personal
rejection letters make us feel any better to get rejected, with specific
notes to poems, or is it easier for everyone involved to just get a form
letter?

Dear Jim,

I find rejection notices much more palatable in the first case, with a
little note, even if only an adjective with exclamation point attached: "Strong!"

I find them more palatable still if they are delivered wrapped around a
Beanie Baby, especially one of the Grateful Dead "dancing bear" beanbags
made by Liquid Blue. Admittedly, this has not happened to me yet.

I think the best possible way to be rejected would be something like: "I
can't bring myself to defile your poems by association with the East
Mauch Chunk Review. You're much, much too good for us. We are enclosing
$25 to enter your entire manuscript in the Yale Series of Younger Poets,
and we'll see what we can do about bribing the judges. Plus, I
discovered your website, and find you so beautiful that it is seriously
disturbing my emotions."

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Olson wrote, in "Place; & Names"

the crucialness being that these places or names
be as parts of the body, common, & capable
therefore of having cells which can decant
total experience--no selection
other than one which is capable
of this commonness (permanently
duplicating) will work

He read it aloud on stage with Creeley, Duncan, Ginsberg and Whalen at the
Univesity of British Columbia Poetry Conference, 29 July 1963, upon which
Allen said "I don't understand what you're saying."

I realize there are a few folks on this list for whom Olson isn't important,
but I note the enthusiasm -- I was only ten in 1963, but before that decade
was over Carlos Castenada and LSD had shown me a little of that world of
"total experience" -- what he calls earlier in the poem the "Isness of
Cosmos" -- that feeling may only be transmissable, in poetry, through such
"factors of naming" -- a literal concrete, an actual earth of value . . .

We're a few miles down the road from the abstract French lyric, here.

I like a little note.  It doesn't have to be
specific--in fact, sometimes when an editor is too
praising of a poem, my reaction is: "then why didn't
you take it?"  Just a simple "these almost worked,
please try us again," if the editor in fact wants you
to try again, will do.  If they just aren't interested
at all, no note is fine.

To me, a mentor is not someone who has taught me how
to write poems...my mentors are people who have taught
me how to live a writer's life.  I think of mentors
not as instructors in compositioin, but as examples of
ways to juggle writing time and jobs, or of how to be
generous and kind, or of how to stay committed to your
own work. They teach me things by simply living in a
smart way, a way which allows poems to happen.  That's
how a mentor is different than a teacher for me.

I also think of mentors as people who are invested in
my own work.  I've had a lot of great professors and
teachers, but only some of them treat me like a peer
and seem interested in helping me move forward in my
career, by suggesting places to send my work, passing
my name on to editors or panels, etc.  Mentors don't
HAVE to do this in order to be mentors, but some
advice about the business end of things is very
helpful from someone I respect.

Interesting questions, Jim!

the worst: getting a pre-printed slip two days after
you sent out your submission. "These are not for us.
Please read our magazine" (annoys me particularly when
I'm a subscriber).

A note is nice.

But the best way is probably something editors can't
do much about: me being in a state of mind and
organization where I know where to send next ... and
have the envelope and cover letter ready.

My mentor in my 20's was a jazz musician, not a writer. He taught me about
music, which I later applied to writing. But he also taught me work habits
and discipline, which were more important over the long haul. Although I've
taken creative writing courses, reading and writing taught me most of what I
know about writing.

Through all five of my books traces of Kabbalistic thinking  the
host/ghost behind most all its machinations. Particularly ways in
which Kabbalah is concerned with text as "a continuum of letters", a
network of echoes, traces; displaced in a palimpsestic process of
rupture, supplementation and dis-ease. How it itself is inscribed
through slippage, elision, differentiation and undecidability, and
carves out a supplemental space that opens possibilities for
alternate reading strategies=8A.How it problematizes the metaphysics of
the "propre" of logocentrism, linguisticism, phonologism, the
demystification or the de-sedimentation of the autonomic hegemony of
language=8A

I actually did my doctoral dissertation on this  -- "Of Poetic
Thinking: A 'Pataphysical Investigation of Cixous, Derrida and the
Kabbalah.

Also, I am so fascinated with how though Kabbalah announces itself as
a "metaphysical" discourse, through a deconstructionist or
post-colonial reading praxis, the "meta" (beyond) becomes an
intervening space, a place of syncretism, juxtaposition and
integration=8A  So, though it's mostly acknowledged as a "mystical" or
"metaphysical", not as an onto-theologically insulated discourse
validated by transcendency, but as that without specific meaning and
heterogenous to all hermeneutic totalization. Showing how these two
seemingly oppositionary discourses actually infold into each other,
caress each other, speak to each other=8A..

Good work Rod!  It's a wonderful book and a big, huge quantum leap
for Anselm Berrigan, whose previous work I have also enjoyed, but
this book is really something different, it gives you the passionate
can't-put-it-down experience of reading a great novel, and
technically it's so assured you don't even notice how he, Anselm, is
producing all his effects.  The hero of "Zero Star Hotel" goes on a
mythic quest; the story's told very simply, with lots of gritty
detail and an attention to surfaces and realities that grabs your
interest and won't let go.  I can't speak highly enough about "Zero
Star Hotel" but in the words of Paula Abdul, Anselm, you have raised
the bar for all of us, you're my American idol now.

For me it's a question of the acknowledgment of a
constellation of writers and the ability that one
has/is show/ is pushed into entering into such a
community. Everyone who gives me/ shows me/ mentions a
writer I'm unfamiliar with is a sort of mentor in my
eyes. The kind of constructed narrative of the poetic
tradition I've gotten from some teachers/ courses
hasn't been as helpful as what I learn reading a
single book. This is interesting to me as I gear up
for the first meeting of the course I'm teaching on
experimental poetics. Originally, the course was going
to follow a historic route, but considering that such
histories are nullified in a sense by the timelessness
of differing poetic spheres--writers working w/ each
other's stuff outside of the historic moment--I
decided to mix it up and read around rather than
through in terms of the time line of the texts. I
guess I see the role of a good mentor (is that
redundant?) as someone pointing to various doors and
maybe giving a little nudge toward them...of course
it's always nice to say &#34;get yr hand off my
shoulder, i know where I'm going&#34;

The least objectionable rejection I ever received was the one that informed
me that while the editors loved my submission, the journal had run out of
funds and was ceasing publication.

Jim Behrle asks:

<I'm curious about poetic mentoring.  At work on an essay called "Kill
Yr. Mentors" and am interested in the pro's and con's of being
"taught" poetry.>

I Reply:

I believe that no one can teach poetry writing. Not really. There are
some craft issues that can be taught . . . amd some aspects of style
that can be, should be, thought through. But teachers can do that.
There are some tasks that can be worked on (suggesting poets to read
. . . suggesting journals, etc), but the art can't be taught. If it could,
then wonderful teachers would have only, or mostly, wonderful
students. And that just isn't the case.

For me, the several mentors I've had were mentors specifically for
taking the time to talk to me. For illustrating a way to be. To be with
and in the art moment. To take that seriously. For taking the time to
talk with this student, this formerly young writer, when they didn't
have to. Someone to encourage me while holding my feet in the fire.
And now my feet are all burned up in the art . . . I see no reason for
killing my mentors. It's they that have helped kill me to myself. Into
being myself. And my poetry bears little resemblance to theirs.

So I don't know of any pros or cons about mentors. But there are
plenty pros and cons of teaching and being taught poetry . . . I believe
that you can't teach poetry writing (but it must be learned). I also
believe some teachers and students get themselves in horrible art
corners by not understanding this. Some teachers think they really can
teach it. And many students think the teacher has some secret that
will deliver them. That can turn out to be, as they say, a bad scene.

I shouldn't have sent my other post for the day so fast because I did want
to say that I think it fine that language poets are getting some bigtime
exposure--for poetry, at least (albeit not for the first time).  It'll be
interesting to read the condemnations of the series for getting up to 1980.

Hey, I just thought of one great virtue of the two-a-day rule: now I don't
have to immediately defend the above.  And by tomorrow everyone will have
forgotten it since the thread will by then have been twisted aside into
various joke-exchanges and others' pop-offs.

The second part is a crude translation of Hui Neng's reply to the master -
the first part was created otherwise. So it was derived from the Platform
Sutra, yes. The second part was done the way I usually work (with Ellen
Zweig) on translation; I used two dictionaries (one organized by Pinyin,
the other by radical - both have old-style characters), as well as Jquick
Japanese software (used radical entery) and Wenlin Chinese software (used
stroke and frequency entry). But I left it in the raw state; there are
many good translations about of course.

The first part is a rough description of a recent 3d animation I did in
Blender; it's the most complex animation I've done so far - about two and
a half hours rendering for 400 frames. The animation uses a moving water
texture and keeps track of around 1200 shaped particles moving in non-
gravitational trajectories; there's no "up" in the space. It has to do
with the creation materials I've worked with. The second paragraph went
through an elimination script that removed duplicate words.

The whole seemed to me 'about' mirroring and evanescence; the particles
are dust, cutter, nuisance, populations, and at least for me, the anima-
tion ties in with the Platform Sutra.

Subject:      Query About James (William, that is)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm gradually rereading James' The Variety of Religious Experience (though
my first read was as a book on the nightstand, as his sober
prose had an uncanny ability to put me to sleep).  I have a query about
James, which it occurred to me that some here may be able to help with.
It's simply this:  is James a theist when he writes the Variety?  Maybe he
answers this at the end.  I have always thought he was agnostic, but I've
encountered passages which suggest that James subscribed more to religion,
any religion, is a good thing school, rather being truly skeptical.

Of course, the whole thrust of his argument may be that the names and,
more radically, intellectuallized arguments about theology, have little or
nothing to do with actual religious experience.  In some sense, he would
say (and perhaps this is Rorty) that people are just swopping names and
labels on something that is a verifiable human disposition.

Dear William Austin,

Where can I find the interview that this is extracted

I didn't see the original William Austin post, but the Koch interview,
which is marvelous, can be found in the lastest issue of Poets & Writers.
Koch also says this, which I found quite interesting: "There are lots of
poets who have the courage to look into the abyss, but there are very few
who have the courage to look happiness in the face and write about it,
which is what I wanted to be able to do."

Either I can't count or Bob is using some definition of "dominant" that I
do not understand -- unless the implication is that Language poetry is
somehow dominating the likes of Oppen, Baraka, Clark, DiPrima and so on and
so on and scooby dobbie doobie

Just to set the record straight, I did answer Pam Brown's inquiry re: the
source of the Koch interview way back on Aug. 27.  I do not ignore people,
usually.  She must have deleted me without opening my reply, then wondered
why I never replied.  Ha Ha!  Best, Bill

Gwyn, Jim -

I deal with rejection like a sour puss but also both as something to avoid
and an opportunity to have a little fun.

I avoid because I won't submit anywhere unless I'm asked.  It feels better
that way.  If no one asks, I become a poor po-citizen I guess.  Or maybe it
makes me a good one.

I also avoid because in 1998 or 1999 after some encouragement from random
literarily (sp?) inclined people, I started sending my poems to publishers.
What was I thinking?  I expected that with 30 submissions I would receive 30
rejections, and anything better was a miracle.  My first submission was a
"success," but that was for a "masters class" at the 92nd St Y in New York
City.  After that, laziness brought out the lesser of the five me's of me
and so I sent out something like 8 submissions instead of the dreamed-of 30.
I bought countless journals wherever I traveled trying to find what I
imagined would be a good match.  The experience was something like combing
the personal ads in a very weird way.  I found 8 that had poems I liked.

I submitted to, well, I'll skip the list of journals.  Suffice it to say it
would underscore my delusions of grandeur.  8 journals.  5 rejections.  3
without any response at all.

I hung each of those rejection slips on a wall, on a costume I wore for
Halloween years ago.  It sits there over my computer where I write every
day.  My opportunity for fun, and a reminder of the way things are.  It also
really toughened my gut to flat-out rejection.

Though my gut was toughened, I've only stuck my neck out twice more, maybe
three or four, maybe.  I don't know.  Not much, no concerted effort like
that.  Those notes also hang from the costume.  Any news ones I receive will
be added.  Submitting seems not to ever work to well when I haven't been
asked to send anything.  So I don't really bother any more unless I'm asked.

The letters sometimes suck.  One small journal simply wrote "Sorry to say
no."  I think the editor was suffering under an ink shortage.   Another,
absolutely nothing but a 2.5"x8.5" slip with an address and two printed
sentences.  Nothing handwritten at all.  It sure beat the deafening
no-response silences of the other three, however.  Pleasantly, the one
particular Big Famous Journal sent me one of those encouragement rejections.
You know the ones, the ones with editorial suggestions and a request for a
resubmission at a specified later date.  That was very positive for me,
though I never bothered to resubmit.  I was quite skeptical of it.

I might stick my neck out again next year.  Maybe.  I did just plop a couple
of books in the mail this week, actually, so I guess that counts.  I am
certain of "no" but tried anyway.

Rejections are good if you want rejections.  If you don't want rejections
then they're not good.  I think I very much wanted to "earn" my first
rejections, to give myself a dose of reality and buy that $1 ticket for the
$29 Poetry Lotto, with a likelihood of "winning" much lower than winning the
Pick Six for $20 mil.  I wanted to lose.  I wanted to decorate that costume,
which was a much needed act of humility for me.

It would be nice to receive personal notes, but isn't composing them
unrealistic for most editors?  I believe in correspondence to the point
where I'd be ashamed for not responding to any and every sort of personal
note.  I realize that my ethic (or fixation) is a bit unusual.  3 of 8
journals don't respond, and that is not just true of journals.  That's true
of the poetry population as a whole.  3 of 8 make it unrealistic because
they don't have the time.  Or something.

Also, I'm curious what the best way to get rejected is.  Do personal
rejection letters make us feel any better to get rejected, with specific
notes to poems, or is it easier for everyone involved to just get a form
letter?

Dear Jim,

I find rejection notices much more palatable in the first case, with a
little note, even if only an adjective with exclamation point attached:
"Strong!"

Anyway, thanks for the information.
I have the interview now.

pelican waters

pelican truth, bill and eye wrapped around smoothed water-worlding, moving
through moving What white lozenge, what orange pill, moves through this
Universe, Pelican cried. "It is darker and darker - one can sense the
percolations, the billows come from nowhere." Suddenly, an explosion: an
element adds itself, irrevocably, to the particle-field. Darkness descends
as light is suffocated by the proliferation of forms.triad immensity just
now, tending towards triple-orthogonal-mirror-corner, always reflecting
directly back to the beholding. "Therefore," she said, "everything is kept
out of it, out of the central incubator." there is no incubator, no
centrality, no manifolds, no fields, what is so empty about this, the
sheerness of cliffs, angular cutting-into the semblance of fields, fields
are representations, breaths. Mining or minding the darkness, the
extinguishing of light. henry, there's a beam there. you saw it just a
minute ago, star-field of some sort. the gate we've been looking for. it
doesn't go anywhere, there's no metric, you can't see anything. around or
over or under the beam, across it, suffocation's almost complete. "She can
imagine the flickering of screens - silk, not celluloid - to similar
effect. As I'm writing this, the planet appears. of which there's none
anywhere, no skies, no coursing waters. pelican-eye long since darkened by
repetition, scenario's just about gone - "I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING NOW."

I think I've said this before, but I liked Clayton Eshelman's rejection
letters
more than most others. Seriously---at times he was right on; he would
judge
me by what he thought (often correctly) I was trying to do, rather than
say the
"masters" he often invokes for himself. I thought Hoover and Chernoff
did this/ do this, to some extent as well.
Regardless of what others say of CE,  I thought this was
admirable---even if at times
he was also off, it was still preferable to others who, whether they
accept or reject,
you (I) don't really feel it (it becomes kinda meaningless....).

My simple point is that now a very mainstream series of books has paid
homage to a great many language poets and poets like Ashbery more related to
language poets than to Iowa poets.  This, to me, is further evidence that
language poetry is in college English departments what post-Einsteinian
physics is in college physics departments: considered cutting edge and
therefore highly respected even if less taught than conventional poetry and
physics.

regularly ignore might visit SpiderTangle at

I'd be surprised if there are more than two annual issues of this anthology

Study Finds Reciting Poetry Calms the Heart
Thu Sep 5, 5:42 PM ET
By Charnicia E. Huggins

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - While the rhythmic sounds of poetry may woo a
lover's heart, it might also be healthy for the heart of the speaker,
according to recent study findings.



"Our findings suggest that the stress-releasing effect of guided recitation
of old poetry can lead to a deep relaxation afterwards," Dietrich von Bonin
of the University of Berne in Switzerland and Dr. Henrik Bettermann of the
University of Witten/Herdecke in Germany told Reuters Health in an e-mail
interview.

"This effect could be beneficial not only in stress management but also for
the prevention of heart disease and other illnesses related to irregular
breathing," they added.

The researchers investigated the effects of poetry on heart rate in a study
of seven individuals. After having their heart rates measured for a
15-minute period, the study participants recited poetry for 30 minutes, or
spent the same amount of time engaged in conversation. Then their heart
rates were measured again, also for 15 minutes.

After reciting poetry, the study participants' heart rates slowed to match
their breathing rates in "harmonic interaction," according to the authors.
Further, this effect persisted for up to 15 minutes after the recitation
exercises, the investigators report in the International Journal of
Cardiology.

No similar effects were observed when the individuals engaged in everyday
conversation, the researchers noted.

In light of the findings, "we recommend to foster old skills like recitation
of rhythmic poetry not only in therapy but also in education, in order to
optimize early prevention of heart disease and other stress-related
problems," von Bonin and Bettermann said.

These findings may also help explain the calming effect of chanting, the
researchers note, "since chanting of calming songs also generates a slow and
deeper breathing."

Patrick (assuming you were talking to all of us ...
and that included me..)

3 out of 8 journals may not have responded because
-- their ed. assistant got sick,
--they are not very organized and lost your submission
(it's now under a heap of 'People' magazines),
-- there was no address on the poems and they got
separated from the cover letter (the editor has them
on his bedside table and hopes you'll resubmit),
-- the poems are the worst they ever got and they've
laminated them and hung them in their office for dart
pratice,
-- they only take submissions from people they know,
-- they only take submissions from people who inlcude
a 100$ check,
-- they did send them back but your SASE did not have
enough postage so it got sent back and thrown away
--some of the above may not be serious.

Personally, I *always* send a reminder (including
SASE) after 3 months.  Out of respect for myself and
my poems. I usually get a response. After another four
weeks I send a post card telling them I'll offer the
poems elsewhere.
Barbara

Having said and done my little piece I was ready to retire to lurking again,
but I found something that I'd like to bring to the list's attention.
Please accept my apologies for bringing up this subject again.

I was warned back-channel against protesting Alan's over-postings, either in
jest or otherwise.  Just tonight I found Jeff Harrison's little diddy called
Jesse Glass Aubade on the fiction of philosophy list.
.

Jesse bobbing [    ]'s erection

Glass overthrow.

I don't mind Jeff's fantasy scenario as much as the title, which shows up
quite nicely in Google's search engine, thank you. I've suggested to Jeff
that he remove this posting, or at least change the title, which would still
allow Jeff his fantasy.

I presume Jeff is a friend of Alan's and certainly did this with his
knowledge, as Alan also posted on the same list at about the same time..

The warning I was given was essentially that Alan's friends (with Alan's
consent) would try to bash me if I said anything, and if you go back to
their postings you'll see that many of them became quite direct--and quite
threatening-- about what I was doing: either shut up or else.  Well, now the
bashing appears to be happening.  Why is it when one person attempts to give
voice to what many people feel on this list, that things like this happen?
Why is it that Alan feels the need to set his "friends" loose on people who
protest (if even in jest) what he is doing?

In my book, this is not cyber-poetry tricked out in French philosophy of
language.  This is a worthless little  lesson in what Hitler knew so well.

Why do I deserve this?  Well, the moral, I guess, is that I shouldn't have
said a thing about Alan's over-postings.  And I should suffer Jeff
Harrison's bashing because I somehow "asked" for it.

Let others take heed and knuckle under, or decide for yourself if Alan
Sondheim (with this brown-shirt friends) really should continue to run his
factory on this list for another eight years.

Now, with everyone's leave, I would like to hand this subject over to some
of those people who have back-channeled me during the past couple of months.
If you appreciate my courage in my interventions, then please reveal
yourselves to this list and continue the protest.  Be courageous too.  I'm
sure you're more than adequate in answering bash for bash.

As for me, the summer is winding down, and with everyone's permission, I
will return to more pressing matters.

Jesse

I Reply:

I never went to Iowa, so I can't say for certain what all Iowa poets are
like, but I do know some Iowa poets, and those Iowa poets write
poems much more like Ashbery's than like what some might consider
an "Iowa Poem" to be. In fact, there seems to be a great deal of
interesting poets and work coming from places many consider The
Land of the Enemy.

Which, of course, brings us back to the question of what the avant
garde is then, when so many poets use the techniques of what the
avant garde was. And what of the poor Deriere Garde?

I don't believe that

People do threaten to bash each other, yes; but I don't know anyone less
likely to support such a thing than Alan Sondheim

I admit I know nothing about the posting against you that you are speaking
of, but I am against *all slander and libel - i.e. including those directed
at you - and I find *your reference to Hitler and brownshirts applied to
Alan extremely offensive

Ignorant too. From what little I know of the brownshirts, what you are
talking about, if true, would be nowhere in the same league. It sounds like
small school playground stuff. It all sounds that way. Grow up, please.

As to threats in the archive, if you have anything concrete then I think you
should take it up with the listowner. What you assert would be against list
rules and possibly illegal

In my experience, calls for people to see for themselves the evidence in the
archives, when there is however no specific quotation and / or citation,
turn out to be wild goose chases, not showing what it is claimed they show

two scents--

1. doesn't ashbery kind of come before the "contemporary" division of poetry
    into "iowa" and "language" as it were
2. as i'm sure someone else will say, quite a few of the lang pos, as well as
writers
    chronologically between ashbery and the l. poets (like ted berrigan, or notley
and
    tomaz salamun----well, the chronology starts to blur around here) were
iowans....

John Gallaher,

I'm surprised you don't know what an Iowa poem is like.  Here's one--from an
outsider's point of view.  Still I would call it "Iowa School."


   IOWA SCHOOL

   O Iowa, Iowa
   I never went to U.

   In spite of that
   I like your rhymes,

   the way they aren't
   like Ashbery's.

   Keep it up, O Iowa;
   just keep being U,

   keep filling up the pages
   of Best American Poetry 2002.

I forgot to mention that there is an alternate ending now that BAP '02 has
actually been printed; it goes something like:

   Keep it up, O Iowa,
   just keep being thee;

   undoubtedly you'll conquer
   Best American Poetry 2003.

Dear Folks,

This item goes well with the questions about William James' "Varieties of
Religious Experience."  In this case, the poetic healing would be human
rather than divine experience.  When my wife was pregnant I would read
poems -- rhythmic poems, such as Shakespeare's sonnets -- up against her
tummy, and she and the baby would go into a trance-like soothing
state.  I'm not sure if Iowa, Bepop, or Hallmark would have the same
effect.  I did not read any T. S. Eliot poems, for fear of a still birth,
but O'Hara's "Second Avenue" was a big hit -- or at least a big kick.  Now,
is this comment appropriate for the list, even though I didn't mention
anything about Alan Sondheim?

Other note:

I remembered another gang of New York School: the Siamese Banana Gang.  How
could I have forgotten the terror of Yorkville and St. Marks Place?

May be inscribed in and never receive a rejection letter from The Great
Book of Poesy for the Jewish New Year.

Normally, rejections produce an instantaneous ping/pain of some sort, and
then I move on.  Possibly, the personal ones, the near-misses, the
explanatories of why and how have more ambivalent ripple effects.  For a
real send-up of the rejection genre, read the opening pages of Sorrentino's
Mulligan Stew.   My most memorable rejection came over the phone when I was
sending my memoir, Living Root, out to agents.  One agent had been a senior
editor at a publishing house, and when I called after a couple of months,
she said, you know some of this work reminds me of Leiris.  I said, yes (my
heart leaping), his autobiography, Manhood, was something of an influence
on me.  She then said, well, that's too bad; when we published Leiris, he
sold less than 500 copies, so I'll be returning your manuscript.  It's
really not commerical enough.

I have always thought of "stereotypical Iowa poets" (should we say "AWP
poets" now instead? but the AWP IS the MLA) as the poets Kenneth Koch
derided in some lecture I read somewhere: the narrator is driving down a
road lined with corn fields thinking about his troubled marriage when he
hits a deer.  Reasons to love Ceravolo's work?  More troubling to me is
the relatively recent embrace in my local local community of the Koch -
Lehman etc. "Columbia boys" lineage of NYS School poetry as light verse
a la "Stand Up Poetry" (also a local thing). It's a logical conclusion
from "last avant garde" but all of a sudden I say New York School and I
mean every cheap and easy assignment poem that's ever come down the road
lined with corn.  As you know, Mr. Collins (UC Riverside with Ron
Koertge) blurbed Towle's Collected.  Yeah, verily, I have heard BH
Fairchild, Collins, and New York School mentioned in the same sentence,
"I do this, and I do that" on open-mike night, shouted over the
cappuccino machine, etc.  I am even more distressed by exercises in
workshops, and the way in which they seem to be uniting all that's bad
about "creative writing instruction" and conceptual poetry.

I guess because there isn't an edge to much of this humor?  It is
comforting?

Am I just resisting an end to the poetry wars which I think might have
ended, as a very 20th Century thing given us by modernism, except for a
few die-hard second-rate Wintersian polemicists who took a losing
position by claiming not to be able to understand a word Barrett Watten,
Iowa grad, puts to page?

Or is they key to point out how funny some language poems are (after
all, the reason I was able to read TEMBLOR while standing in a bookstore
on 115th street) -- "students, don't think, you're romantic artists,
here is a funny poem by Kit Robinson, who went to IOWA."

Let me know,

There's another way to look at this. I certainly don't want to try to define
the term language poet, but it is possible to note that only six people who
appeared in Silliman's American Tree anthology also appear in Creeley's BAP.
Not a huge overlap. The absence of, say, Hejinian, Andrews, Perelman, Watten,
Harryman, etc.
is striking.

Interesting and similar thread on Poetry etc.
Here's a short dialogue of mine and Kent Johnson's from the thread...
Would love to hear what folks have to say.

True dat, Kent. And, amen, really.

Here's the interesting part. I would venture to say that Langpo is even
more dominant in the academy then the McPoem of Billy Collins. But, Billy
Collins' books sell much more than Ron Silliman or Charles Bernstein or
Lynn Hejinian or Bruce Andrews, etc.  Do those who consider themselves
Langpos out there believe it has anything to do with the Marxist
theoretical underpinnings that Ron articulates in the NEW SENTENCE? Does
espousing an anti-capitalist subjective rhetoric have anything to do with
this? Why does Billy Collins sell more than Susan Howe? And, do Langpos
base their "Langpo is outside the academy" logic on book sales?

The anthology should be called The Best Known American Poets and Those They

It's half-amusing, half-frustrating that many discussions on this list get
detoured into the same vast dead-end.  Whether Language Poets are taught in
universities has nothing whatsoever to do with the publication of the BEST
AMERICAN POETRY 2002.  I'd urge some of the people who have posted on these
threads to now go check out the actual anthology.  Bark up some another
tree.

from Robert Creeley's introduction:

"Whether or not there is finally the 'best' of anything is no doubt a moot
point.  Yet one wants for those here assembled not only Coleridge's 'willing
suspension of disbelief,' which enables all and any reality to be the case,
but also a recognition that they are those who, as Charles Olson wrote on
his own behalf, 'live [their] lives quite properly in print.'  It's not that
they don't each one have other lives, of whatever significance or value.
But here they are as these words, and structures of words, allow them to be,
neither more nor less...

So what is *best* then?  How is that choice ever to be made?  Despite all
the accumulating opinions, or, is it called, criticism, how can one possibly
claim to know what's best in any respect?  I think the debris of such
assertion over the years I've lived.  Was World War II the best?  Was
'Better Living Through Chemistry' the best chance we all had?  Or, even more
haunting, *Is this the best we can do?*

I'd like therefore to dismiss that specious and insupportable claim, at
least for the present volume.  These poems are *better* than the best, each
and every one of them.  If you don't agree, then go find your own--which is
not offered as a challenge....

I thought that these poems now to follow were among a great many that might
well follow them and also be the best, and that they in turn might well find
others, so that they also might follow, and be the best, too--for each time,
each place, and each person."

"a falling in autumn"

Felt as a mistake in translation, leave for leaf,
so the tree is an exit, a door into weather,
a symmetry in the spectrum & the stasis
of an open page. Here, morning unfolds
from moment. Recasting the body in sound.
The trace of objects. Echoes. What's
lost in the margins. Another X filling its box.
All told, a centering of sorts. A sphere reflecting
or spun to refraction. Webs, cross-stitched in the corners
& the leaves, unlatching. Desire is the watermark
of sight--a soaking-in. The absence of song
or the absence of sin. Noise isn't what's been lost
on ears, roots or dying limbs. It's impenetrable.
& this is the silence we're playing back to the sky:

Dear All,

In the old days, two or three years ago, I was rapped over the knuckles
by the then manager of Buffalo Poetics for making up frivolous names for
Mars Bars (in the interests of bonding with our British brothers, you
see).  Given the asperity of that regime, the current equanimity in the
face of Jesse Glass's rather hateful  attacks on Alan Sondheim
is surprising.  If Alan Sondheim, whom I have never met, asked me to
wear a brown shirt to one of his manifestations, and if I had one, I
would do it (if it didn't look too horrible).  But
not the sort of brown shirt Jesse Glass is talking about.  Oh no.  Not
at all.  Kent Johnson, is that you in Jesse Glass?  Come out if that's
you!  Doesn't anyone care any more?  Okay, tomorrow I'm gonna post as
many frivolous names for Mars Bars as I can come up with.  Meanwhile, 3
cheers for Lawrence Upton.

Dipping into rust, the trees
protrude like abandonment,
creasing a sky swollen
with leaves. The birds
are frilled with oxidation;
their departing calls
scrape over the fresh abrasion
dusk leaves on our faces, peppered
with the waking bats' morning
thrum; and now I feel
like I'm walking through quicksand.
As fast as all this is,

curbs like crusts of day-old
bread ridge the parking lot,
dipping at times into walkways
as graceful as your shoulders when
I rub you to burrs, thistlelicious,

with no envy for things that float.
I wish I was a hummingbird too, you
tell me: but that's a sadness

like walking through the coldest water
cupped in the back of your throat, and
not even fighting as it fills you up.

I paint the whites of my eyes.
I paint them green, with gradations
absconding. I paint my eyes
the same as the colors of mirrors reveal.

Color is sex. It arcs
out of the three-dimensional
in a bend that is seditious, is collage
of relation and expectance. What
exception to this, that
I point to the plain of my eyes, and
flying
know only their insides as a verso of
dimming!

Shoves a dissolves of crystal in your see the personal
of sits
rigid but within on no faults in the coloring but
sighs away from
us explosion rear restaurant centering waits stilly
cooling on
glass in everything show business bitterness as timid
so
relentless teleportation dimensioned white colors low
sitting at
pasture rivets endanger cup funnel churl knives in
cornea cochlea
 slow buildings

After you go to work, which is usual in this, I go out
on the
back porch and sit with a cigarette in my hand trying
to read.

I am waiting to render my music as an mp3.

Several reasons why site is wonderful, while sitting
here, coat
my tongue just as well as if they were online literary
venues,
all of which contain work similar to yours and yet
refuse to
publish her. He stands up, angular head just conically
brushing
the low-flung ceiling elegant as a woman's hand pastry
clumped in
with exotic scale tabulature that makes possible in
skeletal
upbringing the child's ultimate uselessness as a
reason to sit
and bitch and moan about almost totally unacceptable
behavior,
anon. Let the games begin, she thinks. Moss erupts on
both sides
of the trees in Richmond Virginia. They swung across a
fleshless
pool of dimming radar eqipment that couldn't scan the
horizon
anymore; sitting back down, he notices the wild
breathing of
flaneur yarn spun winded around his facial gestures. I
doubt very
seriously that the color of this font is as pleasing
as a deep
throat full of verbs.

Gradually, I write the seminal
influence of color across
my hands. It's night is
drawing near, shadows
in the very shape of liquid
dusk suddenly, like a rain
or a relief from under a vellum sky.
That I want to tear your clothes off, or
your skin, that I am a ghost seeking
embodiment, bodes harm on a casing
that limns out review material for the
online content provider, 1967, and
and was wash with gray saw fart tarsel.
Getting by. I pint my hunds gray, thee

sane colour as you, who imprint the temporal
with heat the size of reading, wedding
flesh to neuralgia, asterisks to
resin stacked and garbage calculated, with algebra
on my mind again, how it soothes to collapse
variables on a level with de Kooning.
These exceptions to green are a delicious
slow building romance, one
that leaves her alone in a humming room, eyes
locked safely behind crystal watching him monitor
the sluggish eroticism that servers erupt into

when stroked.

Re: Zero Star Hotel by Anselm Berrigan, new from Edge Books

I strongly second Kevin's high praise of this poem.  I saw it in a perhaps
earlier form-- constructed in a grid of tight, sonnet-like stanzas that can
be read down or across or both ways simultaneously-- and was blown away.  (I
wanted to put some of it in Ecopoetics, but didn't know how to excerpt it--
it's so much of a piece.)  An amazing zoom between macro and micro, and
command of a page moving in all directions at once.  Very tightly executed,
and maximally open to surprise.  While the emotion remains highly focused,
the modes of reading seem numerous, if not endless.  Get it.

fyi - forwarded announcement from Susanna Rich of Kean College:
    We will be broadcasting the inaugural program of Poets on Air over the
Kean University Radio station, WKNJ, Union 90.3FM at noon on Wednesday
9/11/02.  It will be a memorial blending poetry and music in response to the
terrorist attacks of last September.  Hope you can tune in to listen to poems
by such luminaries as Emily Dickinson, W.B. Yeats, Stephen Dunn, Charlotte
Mandel, Carole Stone, and many others. We are still in the process of
arranging interviews and possible simulcasts.  If you can't tune in, let me
know if you want a CD copy.  The station's reach is short, but sometimes it
helps if you sit in your car.

hi mairead:  we haven't been equanimous at all; check out, in the
poetix archives, the long threads entitled first "Help!" and then
"attacks."  what you are reading, about brown-shirts etc, is round
two of a series of salvos that started in july.

Dear Maria and all,

I've been out of the loop and have only been following these discussions
since the beginning of August.  Even in that time though I've been
surprised at what appears to be
list management tolerance of viciousness.  This surprises me because
even frivolity
was frowned on when I was last a contributor.  I was wrong to suggest an
affinity
between Kent Johnson and Jesse Glass.  I do wonder why Jesse is
tolerated and Kent wasn't.  I'd be very happy to read Kent's
contributions here, and Henry Gould's and Gabriel Gudding's.  Yes
sirree.  One of the problems of list culture, and I've just exemplified
it,
to my regret, is that one can tend to be way too slick with names; way
too slick with words in general.

hi mairead:  we haven't been equanimous at all; check out, in the
poetix archives, the long threads entitled first "Help!" and then
"attacks."  what you are reading, about brown-shirts etc, is round
two of a series of salvos that started in july.

and really jesse, brown-shirts is too much, as is mention of hitler.
is this part of your continued attempt to provoke meaningful
discussion?  there are better ways. those of us who identify as jews

Jesse. You are allowed of course to say (just about anything) on the list -
with the obvious exceptions of malicious name calling, racialism (although
there is a problem with too much PC which I like PC but is can become bad:
eg I was atacked for supporting or at least not feeling that the Taliban
were so bad by some wonman as my comments re women there appeared to be
anti-women: now it is not true, what I was pointing to was the way that
issue of )(the way women are orientated in eastern societies etc) was being
used to smokescreen the Afgahnistan question and also to heal Bush etal
build up for war: but in general, and given that ALL countries wor for it, I
want to see eg woman's equality and so on and other human rights)

Now I doubt that people are threatening to attack you physically: we all say
things and this is place for discussion...we arent about to go to war with
each other. If people by ad large agreed with you it might come to: "We
should restrict Alan's postings...." However I think that the two posts a
day is good. It stops me sending too much drivel.

But you have a right to put your case.  But think of it this way: Alan is at
least a "maker" (definition of a poet ) (a "doer")  sure I agree its all a
bit overwhelming: and I found that when I first came on.  But I "talked" to
Alan and he seems a nice guy: I have his CD ROM and I respect his energy his
strangeness ( I mean what appears to me to be such)...sure some might put it
all down as "drivel'"but then we risk not appreciating some very original
work [and of course it would be strange if EVERYTHING Alan wrote was of
equal quality - but the point here is that he is doing a project: working,
doing,TRYING energising the airwaves.....]..Now Alan and Wystan and eg my
friend Leicester Kyle and others who do projects, lists etc etc earn my
respect: (i'm inspired quite by their examples) the passion and or
continuing interest of these writers is inspiring as were all the great
writers epics you can name [and many of course unamed and not "in the canon"
as outlined by Monsieur Harold Bloom bless his beard!] from Homer through
Milton Pope Wordsworth Browning to Pound Olson Williams David Jones Geoffrey
Hill Zukofsky Ronald Johnson and many more eg those like Jim Andrews and
others who are bridging the boundaries wth their
art/poetry/voivce/movies/interaction/cooperation/music/computer
"jargon"/philosophy/science/politics/languages/mysticism/history/craft/pure
strangeness/semi-controlled gobbledy gook/ and so on, and much much more and
such as Ron Silliman of his A to Z series and all  the others we/you/I know
or dont know about: they are fascinating, and that leaves out the Chinese
and many other writers in many other countries and languages and times...so
many creative people with so many ideas: now that doesnt eliminate
individual writing or lyrics,they are not mutually exclusive: wystan and
others and leicester and pound have  and zuk and williams etc have inspired
me to attempt various projects eg one is a kind oof (my) family-centred
"project" wich is also a kind of journal..and alan has also inspired me: now
that's BECAUSE of the frequency of his posts although  i dont get to read as
much of them as i'd like: clearly Alan is passionate about it: if you and I
dont have the energy or talent (we probably do maybe just not now) we
shouldnt crit. Alan: however i use "should" (or "shouldnt")  guardedly as
you and I must also have the right to critique.

Tony Follari slapped me on the knuckles over something  said recently;fair
enough;  i was bit out of line again but was getting "worked up" having just
been venturing into reading stuff by Pilger and felt Tony was  being too
frivolous....

But as to threatening you: if they are they shouldnt - and you are a fairly
humorous person: but Alan feels passionate (maybe he's a little over-serious
about things but that's the way he is driven just now ..or for the last 8
years!) ...I see other stuff on here that i dont like but I just glance thru
it then delete (same fate probably happens to a lot of my posts but that's
how things go))....as to "brown shirt" its obviously rhetoric so i wouldnt
worry about that; we humans always use rhetoric of some kind: but you need
to "stick to your guns" ( ok one can have second thoughts but they shouldnt
maybe be based too much on "pressure" but on consideration of others' ideas)
not send counter - messages that you were just shit stirring...although I
suppose that has its place: but Alan, as I belabour, is clearly very serious
(although I also detect some humour in his posts)....

There's nothing wrong with you critiquing Alan etc but I doubt that there
are so many that are Alan's friends....i think there are some who like his
work, many who are more or less indifferent and some who detest it...and
thus and so it is.

The list is a place I feel for information discussion,poetry as, and  after
or while its being created: notices, suppport, ideas, links and so on....and
I feel it should be (if at all) lightly censored....

If your concerned about saying "upsetting" or "crazy things" have a look at
some of my posts (on the archives): it was from a certain Canadian gentleman
(who shall remain unamed for now by moi) that I thus learnt a new word
"chutzpah"......

i think jesse knows exactly how offensive the terms are.
some folks just need to raise hell no matter who it hurts.

to respond would give it more attention than it deserves, so we ignore it,
much the same as we would ignore the bad behavior of any adolescent.

mongers and nomads, rendezvousing with the furniture, with the past.  they

Hi honey.  Thinking of you often, just suddenly crazy busy.  Old Naropa BA
student Tim Martin called me today and mentioned that he was so impressed
with your work and I told him that Lisa J was going to publish your next
book and he wondered if that was the Joan of Arc one, since he saw your
reading with Bhanu etc in NYC and apparently chatted with you and thought
that what you had to say about that project was really amazing.

so there,

love,

julie

This might be of interest to publishers and book artists who are able to
come to New Orleans on Saturday, October 26, for the New Orleans Bookfair.
I've been to a couple of their earlier exhibits, and the group has a
decidedly alternative energy, everything from books made of feathers &
bones to comics to poetry presses to magazines & more.

Poetry, fiction & art presses represented this year include City Lights,
Lavender Ink, Skanky Possum, New Mouth from the Dirty South, and many more.
AK Press and Anarchy magazine and other political presses will be there as
well.

Also - poetry readings in the afternoon.

Here's the website:

activists and culture jammers are coming together for a weekend celebration
in the heart of old New Orleans.

The fair is being held in conjunction with Babylon Lexicon, an annual show
of daring and perplexing artist books. It is from this foundation that the
bookfair is built -- handmade print working, homemade media, friends
publishing friends for friends of friends.

There will be cook-outs, readings and concerts, culminating in a daylong
book exposition at Barrister's Gallery on October 26, 2002. Tables are only
$7.00. Over 40 different publishers from around the country will be there.
Come on down and check out a book. We'll be waiting.

in honour of alarums, of endless harm


oh captain, our captain, how valiant thou art,
when lilacs last, when thine eyes gouged out,
when blinded, how valiant, how war and thy declarations
rallied the people; when thine arm was lost to cannon,
thine face to ravages of sword and gun, how valiant!
when thine feet were cut by brutal assassination, how valiant!
nations rallied around thee, nations subservient to thee!
how valiant, carry forth full the glory of promise unfulfilled!
the masses, the masses, the masses, our leader, our captain,
out of the cradle, endlessly rocking,
thine ears imploded, the writs of suffocation,
the diseases of degeneration, silent cancers and alarums,
blow again trumpeter - conjure war's alarums.
legless and armless, blinded, deaf, unfeeling, our captain,
our valiant captain, skull churned to heroic fragment,
unrecognizable, alarums, captain of nuclear weaponry,
people lost to cannon, arm'd year - year of the struggle,
vast crowds in protest, oh captain our valiant captain,
when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomed, you were there,
unable to speak, unspeakable

rejections? not really disturbing...
only mildly so when the work i sent is as good as or
better than what the publishers actually went with...
& then only mildly...it's too often a game of
idol-worship for me to get too concerned about...

can anyone tell me the origin of the term
"avant-garde"??

(...Burger's Theory of the Avant-Garde was checked out
of the local libraries...)

and I'm interested not in the sort of vague notion of
it as the early twenty century movement meant to
challenge the role of art in bourgeois society, but
really in the term itself...

thanks,
Noah

The term itself is a military term meaning "advance guard."  Which you
probably already knew.  But I think it was Courbet who first used it in an
artistic context.  As for the first specifically literary application, I
don't know.

When an army unit is proceeding somewhere in war time, it has some
guys who go out in front, what are sometimes called point men.

I go to the shore with my
beautiful boyfriend. There
are trees, standing in
big pools of friction like
everything's electric at
the beach. My beautiful
boyfriend spreads a loving
blanket over the lake
for me to walk over. Teams
of lack players stand
waist-deep in epigraphs
for the television my
beautiful boyfriend shot
up on funny
pills. We walk over
the lake hand in
hand, but I'm not sure
which. I look down and
my wrist is sudden like
a big black bird.

Friends,

I am looking for one book that gives a good theoretical understanding of
humor and laughter--especially with regards to literature, but I would take
a book on humor in general.  I want a book that is not obscure but somewhat
comprehensive and also readable.

A psychological perspective might work well.

Thanks,

the other three, however. Pleasantly, the one particular Big Famous

resubmission at a specified later date.>

I've encountered any or all of the above when sending poems to
journals as well. All that I expect, though, in the case of rejection, is
that they actually will send my SASE back, so I'll know that my
poems are no longer under consideration. That is all that I think they
must do. Interesting how often some journals don't even do that.
Unless the US postal service holds my mail for some reason. (Uh-oh,
they might be saying, this guy's a poet. He probably can't handle
rejection. Let's just keep this letter so he'll think people like him.)

One thing that does happen every once in a while, and that I think is
awful, is when a journal puts subscription information in with the
rejection. It's like a girl telling me, "No, I don't want to go out with
you. But here's a picture of the cute boy I am going to go out with."

Hi, Aaron--

I liked They Used to Call Me Snow White...but I
Drifted:Women's Strategic Use of Humor by Regina
Barreca.  It's of course feminist in slant but she has
many books about the use of humor in literature and
otherwise, and is that rare thing: a totally
accessible academic.  Her work could be easily read by
anyone.

Not comprehensive by any means but very useful.

Love,
Arielle

Benjamin Hollander was born in Israel and emigrated to New York City in
1958, at the age of six. He has lived in San Francisco since 1978. His
books include The Book Of Who Are Was, How to Read, and Translating
Tradition: Paul Celan in France (editor). For the New Writing Series, he
will be reading Levinas and the Police, a long poem from a manuscript
entitled Onome, a work which has been called "a detective-poem, or
poem-noir, a genre unto its own."

The title of Hollander's talk is drawn from two phrases which appear in
different sections of Raja Shehadeh's The Third Way. Through a collage of
journal fragments, personal stories, poetry, citations, dialogues,
aphorisms, real emails and virtual letters, the talk will measure our
responsibility in responding to the question: who can one trust to speak to
in developing truce among "peoples" in the Middle East before (and after)
"develop[ing] argument in order to speak" (George Oppen)?

Friday, September 13, 2002 at 7:30 pm
Small Press Traffic presents
a reading by
Laynie Browne & Leslie Scalapino

Poet, prose, and hybrid genre writer Laynie Browne has two new books this
year, Acts of Levitation (Spuyten Duyvil) and Pollen Memory (Tender Buttons).
A former curator at the Ear Inn in NYC and Subtext in Seattle, Browne?s work
was included in Poet?s Choice, edited by Robert Hass, and she is a past winner
of the Gertrude Stein Award in Innovative American Literature. Her previous
books include The Rebecca Letters (Kelsey St, 1997) and The Agency of Wind
(Avec, 1999), of which Rain Taxi magazine said "the surrealism is distinctly
latter day." Born in 1966 and raised in Los Angeles, Browne recently moved to
Oakland.

A renowned language pioneer, Leslie Scalapino?s new book is It?s go/in quiet
illumined grass/land, a long poem from Sausalito?s Post Apollo Press. Other
recent books include The Tango (Granary Books), reprint of her novel, Defoe
(Green Integer), and a poetic mystery novel, Orchid Jetsam (Tuumba). Alice
Notley says of Scalapino?s latest book: "An enlightened work singing of death,
physical pain, social fearfulness, and where when or whether one is. The
intricate variable stanza, almost danced (like a Greek strophe) sounds one of
Scalapino's favorite themes: inside and outside, the cruelty outside and the
illumination also there, as in here, in space and in time. The stanza leads
one through the space and time of the poem word by word. You can't stop."


All events are $5-10, sliding scale, unless otherwise noted. Our events are
free to SPT members, and CCAC faculty, staff, and students.

    shameless fag and shy butch

    San Francisco Native and Mission Poet Cathy Arellano
    reading with
    Suquamish Poet Cedar Sigo
    Thursday September 12, 2002
    8pm
    LIT @ JSC

    San Francisco, California?Jon Sims Center for the Arts presents Native
American writers Sigo and Arellano for the first of this years acclaimed LIT @
JSC reading series. The event, curated by Reid Gómez, represents recent
efforts by the JSC Diversity Artists Initiative to transform San Francisco?s
literary arts scene into a complicated stomp ground for difference.
    Sigo was raised on the Suquamish Reservation. He studied at the Jack
Kerouac School of Disembodies Poetics. His first book, Goodnight Nurse,
published by Angry Dog Press, is a conversation with his cousins, ?telling
them I?m a fag without shame.? For Sigo publishing is important, especially so
Native writers are not ?ghettoized in Native Anthologies.? In addition to
writing he also publishes the literary journal Old Gold. New to San Francisco,
he is a poet of amazing depth and guiltless audacity. Of his relationship with
the Suquamish language he says, ?The Earth is one word deep, that is your
name.?
    Remember this man.
    Speaking about his writing he says, ?Gorgeous indelible lines present
themselves to me. You can?t ignore them.? Sigo dropped out of middle school
and stopped living at the Suquamish tribal housing project, and began to write
his poetry. He lives without apology, ?trash,? he says, ?is the material of
creators.?
    Arellano, the Mission?s most underrated poet, will read from her recent
chapbook I Love My Women, Sometimes They Love Me. This new work pushes the
edges of what Arellano?s audience has come to love and respect in her brutally
 honest and hilarious treatment of family life on 19th and Guerrero. She is a
?lover not a fighter,? as this collection of love poems attests to.
    She is true, wise and romantic. Don?t mistake her subtlety and sweetness.
She?ll slip you a mickey at the 500 club after a niners night game. You can
bet your paycheck on it.
    After completing an MFA in creative non fiction at the Iowa workshop,
Cathy returned home to San Francisco, continuing her role as a community
activist and historian. Equally adept in poetry, short story and non fiction
Arellano?s writing stands upright with conviction. Her non fiction book, I
Will Survive: Women Living with HIV, further illustrates attentiveness to her
working class roots, and her uncompromising willingness to lay it on the line
for the people she loves and lives beside.
    Admission is $7-12, ABSOLUTELY NO ONE TURNED AWAY. Q & A to follow
reading. L. Frank Manriquez, Tongva Ajachmen singer, cartoonist and painter
will open the evening, and Navajo author Reid Gómez will host. To schedule an
interview contact Reid Gómez. For additional information about the Jon Sims
Center, or the Diversity Initiative Artists Advisory Group, please contact
Charles Wilmoth @ (415) 554-0402 or via e-mail at,
    director@jonsimsctr.org.
    This is an alcohol free event.

freud's jokes and the unconscious is basically a love letter to
jewish jokes (that is, jewish humor, not anti-semitic jokes); may be
too specific for your needs but worth a look.  i've never read the
key texts by bergson or erasmus, but hear them referred to constantly
in this regard.

CHAIN NO. 9: DIALOGUE
Edited by Jena Osman and Juliana Spahr
with Thalia Field and Cecilia Vicuña

In the first issue of Chain we had sent out “chain letters” to some
poets and asked them to write a poem and send it on to someone else and
so on. In that first issue, our hope was that we would meet a whole
bunch of new writers. It turned out that we were already familiar with
many of the writers in those chains. This told us a lot about the
tightly knit social dimensions of the poetry community. In following
issues of Chain, we tried both to celebrate this and to expand it. This
issue on dialogue is yet another attempt to expand the conversation. In
addition to an open call for work, we commissioned a series of dialogues
where we asked people who did not know each other but who had similar
concerns to talk to each other.

Some highlights:
New York Language poet Bruce Andrews and
Hawaiian Nationalist playwright Alani Apio
in dialogue

Philadelphia poet Tom Devaney and
Manhattan poet Edwin Torres
exchange email

the complete and expanded dialogue
between poetics list members . . .
Detroit's Barrett Watten and
Manhattan's Nick Piombino
on the flag

Scots poet Rob MacKenzie and
pidgin poet Lee A. Tonouchi
in dialogue

plays from Washington D.C.'s Mark McMorris, Providence's Aishah Rahman,
San Francisco's Tenderloin Opera Company, and Brooklyn's Mac Wellman

Serbian comic Aleksander Zograf on human and animal dialogue

chain dialogue: happiness
(Stacy Doris, Bahaa Abu Daya, Beth Yahp, Adam Aitken)

chain dialogue: english
(Arnaldo Antunes & Josely Vianna Baptista,
Dubravka Djuric, Francisco Faria, Martin Larsen,
Robert Sullivan, Heriberto Yepez)

The ninth edition of this highly esteemed journal of experimental poetry

makes that interest overt, with both fascinating and radical results.
Includes dialogues between Bruce Andrews & Alani Apio, Tom Devaney &
Edwin Torres, Peter Gizzi & Elizabeth Willis, Craigie Horsfield &
Cecilia Vicuna, Reynaldo Jimenez & Jussara Salazar, Bob Perelman &
Francie Shaw, Nick Piombino & Barrett Watten, and many, many others. An

Dear Aaron,
            this caught my eye. As far as I know,not much has been written
on humour theory,but I can tell you what you need to know,as
I have written and published 4 Comedy books and over 1000 jokes.
I'm a Comedian in New Zealand.Feel free to ask me some theoretical
questions if you wish.

Tony,
I wish you would post some of your jokes to the list.

Everyone else, thanks a lot; I ended up going with the Freud and the
Bergson, complimented by Peter Berger's Redeeming Laughter and some books
specific to 19th-century American humor, which is what i'm focusing on at
the
moment.  It is a delight to do this work. For instance, here is a bit from
Josh Billings (nee Henry Wheeler Shaw, 1818-1885)--


PASHUNCE OV JOB.

Evryboddy iz in the habit of bragging on Job, and Job did hav konsiderable
bile pashunce, that's a fac, but did he ever keep a distrik skule for 8
dollars a month, and borde 'round?  Did he ever reap lodged oats down hill
in a hot da, and hav all hiz gallus buttons bust oph at once? Did he ever
hav the jumpin teethake, and be made tu tend baby while hiz wife was over tu
Perkinses tu a teasquall? Did he ever git up in the morning awful fri and
turf it 3 miles befoar brekfast tu git a drink, and find that the man kep a
tempranse hous?  Did he ever undertaik tu milk a kicking hefer with a bushy
tail, in fli time, out in the lot? Did he ever sot down onto a litter ov
kittens in the old rockin cheer, with hiz summer pantyloons on without
saying "damnashun!"  If he cud du all theze things, and praze the Lord at
the same time, all I hav got tu sa, iz, BULLY FOR JOB!

Aaron,

I don't know any jokes.  Every so often Patrick Herron
tells me that my poems are "really funny" but I don't
know if he means they're funny-good or funny-bad.

I don't believe in funny-bad (unless you count Jim
Carrey) so I assume he means the former.

Punchline:  So the Pope leans back, puts his feet up
on the table, reaches into his robe, lights a cigar,
takes a drag and says "You fuckers are all right."

I forgot the lead-in...

Walter Blair at the Univ. of Chicago specialized in American humor
and wrote a book called (you guessed it) *American Humor*. I
haven't seen it in years, and don't know if it's still around.

He had a pretty fair sense of humor himself. I tried to ask him a
question in class once, and he said, "Mr. Johnson, *I* ask the
questions here."

And someone once asked him what he thought of Philip Roth's
then new novel called *Letting Go* (a roman a cle having to
do with academic life in and around UC), and he responded,
"Well, I think of it as *The Gripes of Roth*.

I don't have the reference handy but another writer on humour is the great
folklorist V. A. Propp. I believe one of his later books was devoted to
humour and laughter.

give me a day.

also, i think bakhtin writes about this too. I know he calls laughter the
surplus of humanity in the epic and the novel in the dialogic imagination.

cheers,
kevin

FIRST ANNUAL ST. GEORGE POETRY FESTIVAL
(in Staten Island, New York)

SEPTEMBER 21ST
NOON TO MIDNIGHT
www.saintgeorgepoetryfestival.com
The First Annual St. George Poetry Festival, an all-day celebration of
poetry on Saturday, September 21, 2002, will bring together several
generations of poets from all across the country to read in a festival
atmosphere from Noon until Midnight.

Readings will be interspersed with screenings of experimental films inspired
by poetry, and with rare sound recordings of poets. Presses and literary
magazines will feature works by the participants, and food and alcohol will
be available.

The St. George Theatre is one of the city’s forgotten treasures -- a
beautiful, 2800 seat theatre built in 1928 as a vaudeville house and closed
for the past 25 years. The First Annual St. George Poetry Festival is a
benefit for the theatre, which will reopen as a not-for-profit.

That's a marvellous phrase "an actual earth of value"...
I experienced this "un-understanding " reading Olson eg some things he
wrote when on a tour and what happens that slowly one kinds of "digs" it
what
I've read of the creeley olson letters I found fascinating: it took me a
long while to get "into" Olson as i came late into poetry and knew only
Eliot in 1963 (I was 15 then) and I thought he was English in fact i think
what I knew of pound via C K Stead was that he was english...

.but a book i got a while ago and which helped me in my re-beginning to
write poetry again was titled "creative writing" now it was by an English
writer and I found it
excellent: but one of the things he emphasised was the power and
significance
of names and naming: without recousre to Olson but Olson is right....it is a
fact that we as living things alone need to orientate ourselves in time and
space and thus we name, we remember; we are...this is the ontology the
phenomenology of Olson..when if ever does one (you/I) use one's own name or
another's or a fictitious name? That he feels it is "permanently
duplicating" is strange but there is a "mystical element" to Olson.  I never
used LSD but I think I know what he means by "total experience" which is the
thing attempted even in modernist works and these ideas or techniques "lead
into" the postmodernist.
   How did people respond to Ginsberg's honesty?! It is typically vague of
Olson. in fact what he says there (if it is verbatim or closs) is rather
like a poem it just successfully resists understanding. I have a poem coming
out soon in a local mag which in fact was one of those things i wrote as a
kind of "exercise" idont know what it was about: but theeditr assures me he
understands in completely!  I think that he understands its signification
and musicality not its "message" per se...I had my cockroach saying that " I
always look up the meaning of my poems after i've written them"  "Editor
just smiled secretly...." Actually I've been at readings when I;ve been the
subject of a poem! And not realised it being pissed as a newt til the ext
day but just hearing one's name is kind of "thrilling" -  the ego despite
theories etc is all powerful.... The power and the wonder and the glory of
names... And so on Richard Taylor (Aotearoa)

someone with two fingers

the price tag was missing, down the drain in the sewer with swashbuckling
crossdressed disaster relief . . . maybe if I scan the periodic table, mayb=
e
I=B9ll get a revitalized affect, create a longing that could, in effect, open
portals in my subbasement, allowing blocked passages in the text to flow.
just then I slipped behind the insurrection of a well lubricated scapula  .
. . and instead of the usually discreet tickle, a tsunami raged through my
mobius strip, flooding atolls, rupturing main valves and three turbines.
information came rushing in at a random rate of carbonation, a dog barked
three times and news from my newly completed neuron subdivisions developed =
a
flat zone.  beige crawled into a purple hued aroma. a score of tiny head
shaking voices, smaller than the usual subdialectic emanate from a crowd
that has gathered in my ego, though I can not hear them, I know what I want
them to say . . .

in memory of Karelton Fyfe



Twisted towers fall
Chutes and ladders
You were turned into
A view from a bridge
Look at that them
Diagrams from the news

You Mad Hatter far
Gone turned in two
Hat truss into tatters
Into One tower burned
Trading towers long
Hours it's all true

Some say it matters

Twisted towers all of

Them fall
          Down





Karleton Fyfe, 31, was on his way to Los Angeles when his flight was
hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center. He was a 1992 Philosophy
graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  A friend said
of him, "My guess is that if he'd been watching Tuesday's events on TV at
home, rather than sitting on a plane bound for Los Angeles, he would have
summed everything up with a vintage understatement: 'Man, whoever did all
this ... they're gonna have to give back a lot of those humanitarian
awards.'"

Jim I love this: there's a lot of poetry coming on and I havent been able to
look at other works, or as many works and links as are put on - and its good
that there is more poetry coming on line here as well as some interesting
discussions; i think that maye Alan's "example" ...after all if he puts his
stuff online I thought why shouldnt I? ...we shouldnt be afeared of  crit.
either: but I'd rather be positive...  but I had time for this....I like the
idea of poems that continue with kind of "theme" or repeated theme or
word...and the dust is or could be the endless ramifications of talk: tak
every where: and or theis coulfd be just "assemblage' of words but whatever
I enjoyed it.  Richard.

Aaron. Did you read Ragtime? By Doctorow...That's a hoot. he put Freud in it
and there are a lot of very funny scenes: but a humourless writer is surely
useless. But I have a mate who is mechanic and the only thing he can laugh
at are things that are basically other's misfortunes a habit he picked up
from his ex wife i think.  But some people seem to be unable to see any
humour: which is a worry.

I dont know why people find Beckett dark etc I find him very very funny: the
first time ewas when i saw "waaiting for Godot" now I think from memory
(this was in the sixties) it was played here in French and people laughed
all the way through: os did I. Iknew very little about Beckett then, if I'd
even heard of him and had no idea what it was all about but I still think
its very funny.....my father used to take me to plays...we also saw
Pygmalion and Hamlet: now in that when the Yorick scene started every one
started to laugh at each part but the actors to their credit just kept on
with the play (i think it was a touring English Shak. company).... and
indeed it is rather ridiculously littered with bodies: I also read "Endgame"
which is one of the funnies things I've read: the blind guy everlastingly
orienting himself in some theoretical centre and the parents or grandparents
are in rubbish bins and the guy who is mobile is told to:"Push the
drivellers down!  Accursed progenitors!.." And Watt by Beckett when he
describes  a family with hundreds of relatives each with endless disorders
and illnesses and complaints had me rolling around on the floor I thought I
wouldnt be able to get a breath!!!!"  I find Beckett the funniest...as funny
if not more so than Spike Milligan.  Joyce can be comic ( a  friend of mine
who went to Oxford and hates "postmodernism" or even modernism I think) is
convinced that Finnegan's Wake is a huge joke set by him: and enormous "fuck
you!" he left  for the academics and so on to grovel over and go mad trying
to "decipher" ...wasnt the point of Umberto Eco's  "The Name of the Rose"
that the Church tried to supress humour?

The best can be or is funny.... Because if y' laugh the 'ole worl 'll laff
wiv u an if u crie de 'ole worl jess shets on ya..an ya stay alone...

Dante's big poem was called The Divine Comedy, no?

Bloom finger, from the bottom joint toward, with fat
water
between to ripple cleavage.

Spores with green red, a reddish green savor. The
fringe gripping
onyx sightings. And bends like a dance, which washing
in bird
salutes, like an older woman's hair.

Pumping licorice from one end of once to upon a time.
Reading in

A little contribution to the recent talk about the notion of the
_avant-garde_:

There's more than just a metaphorical connection between the military and
artistic use of the term, it would seem. Picasso famously said to Gertrude
Stein, as they were watching camouflaged trucks parade through Paris in
1915, that it was the Cubists who had invented camouflage (a major
avant-gardish invention of that war).
        An interesting quip, maybe, and one could see indeed how a certain
distortion of space is common to both phenomena. As it turns out (& is
documented by Stephen Kern in his book _The Culture of Time & Space
1880-1918_)the connection is in fact much more than metaphorical: the
inventor of camouflage, one Guirand de Scévola, knew the work of Picasso and
is quoted as saying: "In order to totally deform objects, I employed the
means Cubists used to represent them -- later this permitted me, without
giving reasons, to hire in my [camouflage] section some painters, who,
because of their very special vision, had an aptitude for denaturing any
kind of form whatsoever." Stein, though she did not know of de Scévola, said
in her "Picasso" that the composition of the 1914/1918 war was "in fact the
composition of cubism."

Ah, the old aestheticization of politics routine! Didn't GS have fascistic
leanings? (Supporting Petain, I believe?)

GS also claimed that an oil droplet in water was more beautiful than all th=
e
paintings in the world. (I am paraphrasing - perhaps egregiously.) In that
case, she might have declared the Exxon Valdez oil spill a masterpiece.

Somebody should wrench GS away from the feminists and give her writing a
long, serious political reading. Then again, one might not like what one
finds.

I was surprised to see my name in Catherine Daly's
post on Iowa poets.  I don't mind being associated
with various poets or being characterized as having a
sense of humor, but just for the record, I did not
attend school in Iowa.

A CONSENSUS OF POETS: PRESENT & FUTURE EARTH=20

The Bowery Poetry Club
308 Bowery (Bleecker-Houston)
NY, NY=A0 10012
212-614-0505
Poets Consensus will be held Wed, Sept 11, 2002 from 1-6pm, followed by a=
 reading at 8
The afternoon session is free. We ask a $5 donation for Artist 9/11 Fund =
for the reading but it is a DONATION -- more if you can, or less, or noth=
ing.

Will be poets only talking to other poets. No (adoring or
otherwise) audience. With the idea, goal of making a general statement th=
at can be echoed, added to, resonated, amplified, reiterated, verified, r=
atified --- identified with by other poets and artists across the USA, an=
d across the earth.

=A0 The idea behind this being that amid the chaos of the planet one of t=
he strongest, oldest, and most unified and sagacious voices has not been =
speaking out, making itself heard --- the voice of the poet, the unified =
voices of the poets. And these poets will surely agree on some basic tene=
ts of humanity that are presently being ignored in what is becoming the p=
lanning for the future of this planet, our earth.

=A0 Whosoever shall gather together on this day for the good of humanity,=
 their deeds shall not be in vain. They shall cast the first words of fai=
th in what will become a chain reaction of affirmation of the true spirit=
 of humanity. This chain reaction will be carried forth by other poets in=
 many places in the USA and across earth.

=A0 Those who wish to, respond in person, by e-mail, snail mail --- with =
thoughts, ideas, etc about getting together --- like a sign-on (a sign up=
 sheet) via personal poetic statement that will include something towards=
 present and future earth. There will be no big shots. Important a blend =
of all aspects, flavors of poets. To formulate something everyone can agr=
ee to and yet something that has the bite of the Muse as well.

=A0 Poets and/or other artists meeting in groups as small as two --- or e=
ven one, I guess --- to vow to act in some accordance with each other. Th=
e idea being that small groups form their own sovereign groups and join w=
ith others on issues and statement levels.

=A0 Anyone is a poet who has published a poem, or has read in
=A0 public or who writes poems as a serious activity can be in
=A0 this. Want to make it as non-restrictive as possible.

=A0 Poets should organize in whatever fashion they are comfortable with: =
a workshop, a neighborhood, an apartment house, a venue, two poets who co=
rrespond, etc., etc., and they should establish whatever boundaries they =
desire. As long as they are in the pool and can contribute to a consensus=
. The contribution does not have to be yea, or nay --- it will be any typ=
e of relationship these autonomous groups so desire. =20
=A0 =A0 MAKE THIS YOUR STATEMENT. REWRITE, TAKE SOME LANGUAGE HERE AND TH=
ERE. WE WANT THIS TO MAYBE BE THE START OF SOMETHING WHERE POETS ALL OVER=
 CAN MAKE CONSENSUS STATEMENTS ON WHETHER THE U.S. SHOULD WAGE WAR TO KEE=
PING BOMBING MISSIONS AND ARMAMENT PRACTICE OUT OF ISLANDS IN PUERTO RICO=

I don't know whether this came up or not, but in case it did, I want to
emphasize what I think should be obvious: Iowa School poets are poets who
habitually write a kind of poem associated with Iowa University; they need
not have attended that university; nor are poets who did attend that
university necessarily Iowa School poets.

We're Back.

& we even have a few readings scheduled.

September 15 OPEN MIC--well why not?

THE RULES: since more than half the fun of the Zinc Bar is wondering what
i'm [Douglas Rothschild is] going to say, this is how it (OPEN MIC)
works--bring 5 short poems (nothing over one page) find someone standing
around or something before the reading--hand them the 5 poems, they will
read the five, select 3 and then when your turn comes round, they will
introduce you.

NO EXCEPTIONS...



September 22  DIRECT FROM SAN FRANCISCO:
               Owen Hill             [an interesting poet) &
               Christina Fisher    [a friend of--unless i have this
wrong--Mike Price)
So if you like San Francisco, or know Mike, you should definately come to
this reading.

September 29  NOT TO BE MISSED ! [ok, that's true of most of the
readings--but this one specially)
               Mikeal Blitz         [my boss up at John Jay -- with a very
cool new book) &
               Karen Weiser      [not my boss -- but also with a cool new
book)

October 6  HIP & HAPPENING -- Guarenteed to light hair on fire (yours or
someone elses)
           Richard Loringer    [Brooklyn's very own) &
           CA Conrad            [Direct from Phila. -- don't take my word
for it, ask Jen & Allison!)

October 13 I'M GOING TO SEE MY MOM -- Because if it weren't for Columbus,
we'd all be Italian.

Zinc Bar is located at 90 west houston st. at the very southeast edge of the
old west village (which apparently has moved further east). Just one door
west of LaGuardia Place

These readings are all on SUNDAY (sometimes they are on other days--but not
in this announcement.)
& they start at 6:37PM.

Come see Alex's new computer system!

Please foward this to any and all interested.....

& for those of you seeing this & wondering--how do i get a reading?
Well, not by emailing me !

Come on down to the Zinc Bar itself & we can talk.
Out of town? Get one of you NY friends to come and tell me all about your
work.

Thanks & have a Happy New Year !

I DO want to step into this and say that all the smarmy, crybaby
bullshit about the BAP2002 would be funny if it wasnt so sad. Is it
possible to be an Iowa School poet and not even know it? (bringing in
a related thread, could someone please post an "Iowa poem" to the list
so we can all have an example?)

And with regards to earlier posts whining about the lack of
representation of this or that group of academic/nonacademic lango
vizpo whatever the hellpo, all i can say is, this selection of poets
represents one man's -- Robert Creeley's -- choices for the anthology.
if you don't agree with them, don't like them, don't buy the
anthology, better yet, make your own. i look up and down the list of
names and i see a  lot of strong poets -- i'm not reaching for my
whizpop langpo decoder ring to figure out which bag to put them in and
tally up the score.

best,

much that is valuable can be found via the indices of Slavoj Zizek's books.
but who was the author to whom Peter Quartermain frequently referred in his
talk on humor in the poetry of Robin Blaser at Vancouver in 1995? David

| Somebody should wrench GS away from the feminists and give her writing a
long, serious political reading. Then again, one might not like what one
finds.


Maybe she was a fascist. Yes, let's consider that. Would that be nature or
nurture - say, can you see?

Anyway, what I wanted to say is that "wrench" is an interesting word, not
least in the context.

Not take, or separate; but wrench - violent, righteous, powerful, just what
we need

I reply:

First, I don't believe there is a thing called an "Iowa Poem" since the po=
em
described by this term is not usually from an Iowa graduate. What one mean=
s
by this term, I think, is a personal/autobiographical poem, usually of a
domestic scene, in which someone learns and is comforted by an asertion of=

the order of things. This is also called the "workshop" poem. Right?

Here's an example, taken at random, by Kim Addonizio. I have no idea where=

she went to school. But I know that she did go to school. Took plenty of
workshops.

    For Sleep
    My daughter's terrified of spiders; at night she worries
    they'll crawl over her while she's sleeping, and sometimes when she's
    sleeping
    she dreams they do, and wakes up and runs to my bed,
    crying while I try to soothe her. I tell her
    how they're sacred to some Indian tribes, I take her outside
    where one has strung a glistening web under a beam
    in the narrow walkway between our house and the next,
    a sight she actually does find beautiful=97but the spider,
    hanging there, swaying a little in the breeze,
    she cringes from. I take down a book to show her drawings:
    crab spider, orb-weaver, wolf spider dragging her egg sac
    into the long grass. I teach her spinnerets,
    those makers of silk. But soon she knows tarantula, black widow,
    the suffocated housefly bundled in white threads.
    She understands the poison, the devouring mate,
    how love is less than the slimmest spun strand.
    She wakes up alone, can feel the tiny legs ticking across her cheek,
    the small malevolence that seeks her out; again
    she runs to my bed, and burrows in beside me,
    and I hold her until she quiets, and we wait together for sleep.

"In New York City, rescue crews began to place bodies back into the
smoldering wreckage of the World Trade Center as firefighters sucked water
off of the remains of the building, igniting a fire. The haze everywhere
in the air was condensing into plumes of smoke lowering themselves into
the growing fire which began to construct what would become the foundation
and lower floors of the buildings. As night gave way to twilight the fires
grew and stragglers began walking south towards lower Manhattan. More and
more smoke and ash began to collect itself and rush towards the fire. As
afternoon approached, an enormous pile of debris rose up and formed itself
into a 47-story office building which began to collect plumes of smoke.
Activity on the street increased as rescue crews departed and ambulances
came and went to bring bandaged people from the hospital where they had
been injured and carry them on stretchers into the chaos and smoke. Some
simply had splints and bandages removed and were released so they could
run towards the scene of the construction. Anger gave way to fear as
morning approached. As more people ran towards the partially-formed
towers, debris began to rise up off the Manhattan streets, repairing
damage to cars and buildings and healing many injured people nearby. The
smoke and ash continued to condense until it was impossible to see as
hundreds of people ran towards the gathering structures. Eventually, the
smoke and ash condensed into a wall of smoke and debris which retreated
towards the plaza, until finally it began to form itself into the first
tower, which rose like a phoenix out of its ashes. People flew from the
ground into the windows of newly-constructed tower, where the flames were
confined to a small, as-yet-constructed section near the top. Everyone on
the street stopped where they were and stared at the tower with the
growing realization that another tower was about to form..."

simplicity. In a spy satellite photograph (of the results of a smart bombing=

This is about as perfect an example of a mainstream American "workshop" poe=
m
as one could hope to find, and as such, it's a useful object to examine,
with an eye to the specific belly marks that distinguish it as belonging to
that genus.

The first critical voice I imagine responding to it is one that sounds
something like Marjorie Perloff, commenting on the arbitrariness of its lin=
e
breaks (though there does seem to be a breath-based prosodic design), the
ease with which it could be converted to prose, with no appreciable loss of
ordered structural tension.  Let's see what that would look like:

----

My daughter's terrified of spiders; at night she worries they'll crawl over
her while she's sleeping, and sometimes when she's sleeping she dreams they
do, and wakes up and runs to my bed, crying while I try to soothe her. I
tell her how they're sacred to some Indian tribes, I take her outside where
one has strung a glistening web under a beam in the narrow walkway between
our house and the next, a sight she actually does find beautiful--but the
spider, hanging there, swaying a little in the breeze, she cringes from. I
take down a book to show her drawings: crab spider, orb-weaver, wolf spider
dragging her egg sac into the long grass. I teach her spinnerets, those
makers of silk. But soon she knows tarantula, black widow, the suffocated
housefly bundled in white threads. She understands the poison, the devourin=
g
mate, how love is less than the slimmest spun strand.  She wakes up alone,
can feel the tiny legs ticking across her cheek, the small malevolence that
seeks her out; again she runs to my bed, and burrows in beside me, and I
hold her until she quiets, and we wait together for sleep.

----

Sure enough, there's precious little difference; it's somewhat rhetorically
flowery, but no more so than a lot of short fiction that's out there.  Any
noticeable formal patterns that are lost seem to be accidental, or at least
inscrutable ones, such as the three-letter words that begin the poem's last
seven lines.  Many lines do end with relatively vivid images ("spider," "eg=
g
sac," "black widow," "cheek," etc.), but quite a few don't as well
("outside," "next," "again," "me," etc.).  The Perloff-critic, after
denuding the poem in this way, might go on to ask why the poet did not just
write it in prose in the first place.

Of course, one might do the same thing with an O'Hara poem, say, "Call Me":

The eager note on my door said "Call me,
call when you get in!" so I quickly threw
a few tangerines into my overnight bag,
straightened my eyelids and shoulders, and

headed straight for the door.=A0 It was autumn
by the time I got around the corner, oh all
unwilling to be either pertinent or bemused, but
the leaves were brighter than grass on the sidewalk!

Funny, I thought, that the lights are on this late
and the hall door open; still up at this hour, a
champion jai-alai player like himself? Oh fie!
for shame!=A0 What a host, so zealous!=A0 And he was

there in the hall, flat on a sheet of blood that
ran down the stairs.=A0 I did appreciate it.=A0 There are few=A0
hosts who so thoroughly prepare to greet a guest
only casually invited, and that several months ago.

which, de-strophed, becomes:

Again, the language is a little "strange," but no stranger than when it was
in verse; placement into measured(?) lines is not the source of the poem's
defamiliarized quality, but rather its pseudo-archaic diction ("oh all
unwilling," "fie," etc.  So what's the difference, if any, between the
principle of lineation here and that of Addonizio's poem?  Put another way,
does lineation necessarily perform or signal an integral structural orderin=
g
in the way that my Perloff-critic (to whom I shall henceforth refer as
Critic X in order to avoid putting words in Marjorie's mouth) might insist
it should?  Or might it acceptably, in some cases, be nothing more than a
neutral convention, like leaving margins on a page of prose, or drop-casing
the first letter of the first word of a paragraph for decorative effect?  M=
y
own tendency is to say that O'Hara's poem *does* benefit from its
line-breaks in some way the other poem doesn't it, but I can't quite explai=
n
it.

But anyway, Critic X chimes in, even if the lineation should prove to be
neither here nor there, O'Hara's poem does, as you say (Critic X is now
speaking directly to me--sorry if this is confusing), signal its poeticity
through the defamiliarizing use of unusual diction, whereas Addonizio's poe=
m
is discursively generic--it could be spoken by any slightly-more-articulate=
-
than-average bourgeois mother out of thousands.

One might then reply, however, that Addonizio's poem is compatible with
Ashbery's goal for his own poems: that they be "representative," that they
enunciate a thought or statement that might be anybody's.

But, says Critic X, the immediate transparency of the situation described i=
n
Addonizio's poem militates against what Ashbery means by "representative."
His poems are representative of experience in the sense that they represent
it without representing any *particular* experience.  They are, like,
meta-experiences.  This poem, on the other hand, takes an already familiar
experience--a parent's epiphany that it is not always possible to soothe
children's fears through reasoned explanation, because sometimes children's
innate apprehension of horror is more profoundly sensitive than any rationa=
l
tonic--and expresses it in controlled, conventionalized terms.

And, ultimately, isn't that what it comes down to: the agon between the
referential and the poetic function, to use Jakobson's terms?  (I've droppe=
d
Critic X now and am just speaking for myself, to you, all of you out there.=
)
There are some readers who want poems first and foremost to be "about"
something, and there are others who want them first and foremost to be
*made* a certain way.  Addonizio has her own view on this (I got this from
an interview on the web, using Google): "I think there=B9s a real place for
narrative in poetry.  I don=B9t think that fiction has to be the only place
where you find story telling.  Poets have always told stories, so I do ofte=
n
like to tell stories in my poems, but not always.  And I think the
difference would be that in a poem it=B9s very condensed, quick, and you
usually jump into the heart of the matter pretty quickly.  The narrative is
there to serve that thing that you want to talk about."  She doesn't seem
particularly concerned, as I tend to be, and I'm sure many others on this
list are, with fancy Russian-formalist-type ideas about foregrounding verba=
l
elements that deform the primary reference or whatever.  She wants to get
her idea across, and for her, poetry is just as valid a medium for doing
that as prose, and it's not necessarily any different from prose in its
basic *kind*--only in its level of concentration.  That view doesn't enjoy =
a
lot of currency in any poetic theory that gets taught in academic circles
(when it gets taught at all), but hell, it's a view.

She says in the same interview, when asked "Do you consider yourself to be
part of a specific school of poetry (i.e. Romanticism)?" that what she is
trying to do is "just write about being alive. I wouldn=B9t call myself a
post-modernist, however, so maybe I=B9m some other strain of poetry, maybe
neo-Romantic [laughs]. I=B9m interested in feeling, in communication, being
pretty central to the poem and that=B9s not the project of post-modernism."
Certainly this is an unfair categorization of much postmodernism.  But is i=
t
any more slanted or exaggerated than much of the anti-mainstream rhetoric
that gets routinely thrown around?

I'm not saying I think "For Sleep" is a great poem, or that I would buy
Addonizio's book.  Nor am I saying that I subscribe to her "just another wa=
y
to say something" poetics.  I'm just saying that I can't in good conscience
claim that my way of evaluating and thinking about poetry is more "right"
than hers.  It really seems to be a matter of preference.  I'm not even sur=
e
that in this poem "someone learns and is comforted by an assertion of the
order of things."  If anything, the message is pretty bleak.  The only
comfort comes from the fragile embrace between mother and daughter, which
seems to be presented as an embrace in the middle of a big scary dark
spider-infested pit.  In short, there may be reasons for taking exception t=
o
the world view implied by this poem on ideological grounds, but I don't kno=
w
that any such reasons can be subsumed under anything like a comprehensive
set of *formal* ("constructive"?) principles.

Or maybe they can?  Thoughts?

This so called "tragedy" is dwarfed by the destruction that the and Britain
has dropped on Iraq also he actions of bombing in China pre and during the
revolution, Korea (where hospitals and civilians were targetted and tere was
amassive destruction , Vietnam (see "Rape of Vietnam" by Harold Slingsby)
and "The Pentagon Papers" where chemical warfare was used and also bombs
shaped like toys and more bombs dropped than the Second WW, Indonesia (the
murder of several millions who were identified by the CIA  - see Pilger "The
New Rulers of the World"), the bombing of Libyia, the organised attack on
the democratic government of Allende, "cowboy" actioons in Angola, the
attacks (direct or by proxy) , the atrocities of wars to allegedly get
Noriega (erstwhile an US "buddy",  many other countires such as Guatemala,
the backing of Saddam Hussein right up to the invasion of Kuwait, the
subsequent re-arming of Hussein, the ilegal bombing on the no fly zones, the
millions of $s gifted to Israel and the sale of armaments throughout the
world, the attack on Somalia, the witholding of support to poor countries
and the imposition of enormous debts on countries including Australia to the
extent atht farers there have been forced to abandon their farms,  the
allowance of murders of school children in the US itself, the millions
killed in the US because of the gun laws, the homeless ( I saw them on the
streets of NY), the craetion of Timothy McVeigh who is the other big
terrorist.....the list of iniquities is endless.

Now there is in faact NO evidence that even one arab had anything to do with
S11. I suspect it was domne by te US to galvanise this crazy "axis of evil
crap"...if the USattcks Iraq I'll be looking foreward to more S11s with
relish.  Richard Taylor

Just a quick graph before the minute of silence -- Ron, do you really
think the Green Party was responsible for the disenfranchisement of
America (any more than say Perot was responsible for the Clinton years or
John Anderson for morning in America)?

Wrestling with the ghost of hurricane Gustaf.
Lying with the women of Al Quaida, sleeping
with them. Eating with the tongue of a weak
breeze (that is the dead of the storm, the steak

or pork cutlet of Islam). Wading through wrath
while Israel spills, staining and then keeping
the stain. Drinking cupped from the vengeful creek
of Palestine (and wanting instead the numb cake).

Keeping to the untrained or billowed path.
Keeping to the summer's edge, and then keeping
to the flowerbed. Keeping to the blurs, the streaks
on my window, pain. Cleaving to the flesh of my mate.

Kim Addonizio received her B.A. and M.A. from San Francisco State
University.  Is being an Iowa poet some code here simply for writing lame
poems?  If so, it's a seriously dopey one.  Here are poems from 3 Iowa poets
I really like:


Toy Bed by Joyelle McSweeney

The bobcat poses in a tripod of rifles.
The crown of the emperor penguin slips down halfway
over his eyes. Light shades down bluely from the ice cliff

to the ice. Now this
is a salt marsh, but this can't have salt
or glass. The black wool beret is sodden and itches
and pushes my wet bangs down into my eyes
in little points. The field is flooded, floodened.
This has lost

its ice and good light. I slipped into the channel.
my thin nylon jacket soaked through right away.
Mud pouched in snaky curls inside it. I stood up.
Is there still time to walk

out, pitch a stick and read the current, fold back
the green felt cap, poke a feather through, remove
myself to higher ground? Inside the dry house, thinking.
What does the deer do, now, in the woods? He wears

a too-huge stylized rack. It pulls his head back
black-lipped to the sky, or pulls his head down
and he must graze and brood. It pulls
his lips and makes him smile. It closes his eyes.
-------------------------------------------------

After the Last Fright by Cate Marvin


I carved upon my desk unsayables.
He drank until he vomited on himself.
Eavesdropping, the others resisted sleep.
The house knew the pain of sun on lacquered floorboards.

I carved it with the tips of scissors.
A door creaked; he hung his head into the room.
Please, the others cannot sleep.
The shingles twitched like skin beneath moonlight.

I spent the afternoon at a movie theater.
He staggered through brush toward a pay phone.
The others continued searching the streets for him.
The house held the moon above it, it was that imperial.

I recall the room was empty when I came back in.
He was arrested at the QuikTrip while calling collect.
Frantic, the others circled the block again.
The house was ghost white, older than the dead.

I needlepointed for 72 hours straight.
He claimed the whole situation humiliated him.
Relieved, the others refrained from asking him what jail was like.
The house was swan to field, tiger to sea.

I lay in bed by the time the others came home.
He didn't recall putting on the orange jumpsuit.
The others asked if I'd seen him around.
The house shuddered, No-o-o-o.

The house winced, winked its blinds.
The house whispered I should stay inside.
The others flew out the doors and into their cars.
The others slammed their cars into deer and cried.

He was more humiliated than he'd ever been.
He looked more or less the same, though his eyes were ringed.
The others hid in the basement.
He climbed the stairs and presented a ring.

The house swung its windows wide to ice.
He banged his nails blue, pinned his tongue to his tie.
He packed himself in a box, sent it to regions far off.
The others pressed their ears to the pipes.

The house wore its flames like a hat.
The house called a radio talkshow.
We drank all night, laughed all night, the night he left.
I shook in its mouth till the house drank me up.
-------------------------------------------------

dana plato fatality by Rebecca Wolff

Hungry for strangers
it's that time of the month

Making funny faces in the mirror-
                take it one step further and
Make funny shapes with your body in the mirror

Pose as Shiva with your palms out toward the mirror

Suffused with that irritant
Parroted internationally

known as train wreck

With oncoming blindness
With incoming invisible

Hungry for appetite
it's that kind of collapsed conveyance

fantasia of recall
unchecked with the poke of vestigial freckles

it's unfortunately visible

And she's crying in the mirror like a pornstar

-------------------------------------------------

When will some of us here be finished being lazy snobs?  It appalls me that
most thoughtful, dignified voices here are drowned out by the silly and
embittered.

Jim,

As a holder of one of those degrees so often scoffed at by many in this
crowd, I breathe in the fresh air you just managed to instill in this place.
Thank you.

Iowa, by the way, has for many years had its share of both good and not so
good poets come through its classrooms, streets, and bars.  It's called
life, and it happens in Iowa City on a daily basis.

For those of you who don't agree, and still feel the need to trash places
your jealousies can't handle, I suggest, perhaps, a book by David St. John,
or Norman Dubie, or Philip Levine.  All graduates of Iowa!  All, the last
time I checked, doing better and more memorable work than anyone on this
list, including myself!

Thanks again, Jim.

Sam Pereira

> Kim Addonizio received her B.A. and M.A. from San Francisco State

Jim,

The idea was to abstract the "Iowa School" concept from the actual university; it's
merely a shorthand for poems that seem like they were whittled in the oldest and most
distinguished workshop in the world.  As someone said-- domestic scenes with lessons
embedded in them.  Hence Kim Addonizio.   I hope no one will take umbrage, especially
not my good friend Cate (who studied *fiction* at Iowa, by the way; her poetry MFA
came from Houston) or Rebecca Wolff or Matt Rohrer (go Fence!) or *any* of that
school's fine alumni.

But back to Kim Addonizio.  She was a finalist for the National Book Award:


"What Do Women Want?"

I want a red dress.
I want it flimsy and cheap,
I want it too tight, I want to wear it
until someone tears it off me.
I want it sleeveless and backless,
this dress, so no one has to guess
what's underneath. I want to walk down
the street past Thrifty's and the hardware store
with all those keys glittering in the window,
past Mr. and Mrs. Wong selling day-old
donuts in their café, past the Guerra brothers
slinging pigs from the truck and onto the dolly,
hoisting the slick snouts over their shoulders.
I want to walk like I'm the only
woman on earth and I can have my pick.
I want that red dress bad.
I want it to confirm
your worst fears about me,
to show you how little I care about you
or anything except what
I want. When I find it, I'll pull that garment
from its hanger like I'm choosing a body
to carry me into this world, through
the birth-cries and the love-cries too,
and I'll wear it like bones, like skin,
it'll be the goddamned
dress they bury me in.


Mermaid Song
  for Aya at fifteen

Damp-haired from the bath, you drape yourself
upside down across the sofa, reading,
one hand idly sunk into a bowl
of crackers, goldfish with smiles stamped on.
I think they are growing gills, swimming
up the sweet air to reach you. Small girl,
my slim miracle, they multiply.
In the black hours when I lie sleepless,
near drowning, dread-heavy, your face
is the bright lure I look for, love's hook
piercing me, hauling me cleanly up.



Reading these poems, I was shocked.  Shocked because I am a snob?  If not wanting to
be known as a finalist for the National Book Award after reading these makes me a
snob, then yes.   Kim is from San Fran, of course, but Iowa M.F.A. grads are not
immune to the  insidious Workshop Poem a la Addonizio.  Clicking around in the
Academy of American Poets yielded Jill Bialosky, who actually did go to University of
Iowa--


Fathers in the Snow

After father died
the love was all through the house
untamed and sometimes violent.
When the dates came we went up to our rooms
and mother entertained.
Frank Sinatra's "Strangers in the Night,"
the smell of Chanel No.5 in her hair and the laughter.
We sat crouched at the top of the stairs.
In the morning we found mother asleep on the couch
her hair messed, and the smell
of stale liquor in the room.
We knelt on the floor before her,
one by one touched our fingers
over the red flush in her face.
The chipped sunlight through the shutters.
It was a dark continent
we and mother shared;
it was sweet and lonesome,
the wake men left in our house.



By the way, her book was published by Knopf.   She's now an editor at Norton.
http://www.poets.org/poets/poets.cfm?prmID=243

I guess what I'm trying to say is I agree with Jim in principle-- there's no need to
pick on one program.  Why don't we call it the "Knopf Poem"?  We used to use the
phrase "New Yorker Poem" -- that's not to say everything in the New Yorker sucks,
just a certain taste that distinguished weekly has left in so many of our mouths.  Or
perhaps the "Addonizio School"?  It's not unprecedented to classify a type of writing
around one of its perpetrators--remember the fate of Edward George Bulwer-Lytton
(http://www.bulwer-lytton.com/).

Jim, I sympathize with your stand against bitterness.  Bitterness, and its bedmate
politics, characterize much of what happens in the world of poetry.  At the same time
I really don't like bad poetry, lazy garbage that would nevertheless (those of us MFA
grads know) succeed in a poetry workshop.  Reading this Bialosky poem, I can hear the
groans of approval...

Kasey, thanks for taking the time to put your provocative thought and
questions on e-paper.  I wish I had more time to respond with equal force!
But I'll at least get a few quick thoughts down here b/c it's an
interesting discussion that I hope will continue:

1.  I guess I would want to question this idea of generic-ness. I think
your Ashbery analogy may confuse the issue unnecessarily.  I see Ashbery's
claim to being "generic" as a bit of a canard: for Ashbery "generic" is a
quality, a sound, a style; he's representative only in his uniqueness.
And in a strange twist, it turns out that Kim Addonizio is the one whose
*language* is "representative" - i.e., it looks like a lot of other
language you've seen.  And that's the issue for me: that Addonizio's claim
to be telling us about an actual experience simply doesn't hold water.
She no doubt *had* an experience, but the poem itself is just a formula,
like what the cops give you to get an accident reported/narrated properly.
As a reader, my response is one of utter familiarity - and not just
because I've a read a gadzillion poems like this one but because it's in
the neighborhood of one's everyday habitual retellings of the
"significant" events of one's life.  In contrast, the uniqueness,
eccentricity, peculiarity, whatever, of Ashbery's writing creates a
situation where reading itself is the experience, inter-acting with words
and spaces on the page and, yes, with some transtemporal writing-Ashbery.
An utterly different experience, seems to me.

Last thing: I think prose should be defined more clearly here.  "reads
like prose" means "reads like autobiographical, memoirish,
standard-English prose" right?  This is important since Joyce's or Stein's
or Ralph Ellison's or Nate Mackey's or Emerson's etcetc prose couldn't be
more different from the "like prose" in that "Perloff" sense.
Incidentally, this is where Silliamn's discussion of making prose function
like poetry in The New Sentence is *very* helpful.

Okay,    -m.

Mime-Version: 1.0

I fluctuate between complete consternation with the sullen moves of this
list and a resigned, lethargic delete-fest to cleanse my inbox and soul of
its frequently dim and cruel posts. There are poets here to respect, many
who remain very quiet. To dive in this mosh-pit is often to dance with
fools.

When will some on this list be finished being lazy snobs?  It's like that
band who never got over opening for Nirvana, as Nick Hornby might write.
The stagnancy here is astounding.  If your favorite 10 poets are the same as
they were 10 years ago, you have a problem.  If you're more interested in
creating and defending acronyms than in creating and defending innovative
work, that's a problem.

Many people are here just to naysay and bitch, adding nothing to daily life
here other than to underline they're own ill-lit perceptions.  Why must the
creepy turf wars of former generations of poets be passed down and taught
like scripture?  Is it possible for poets to actually be more than a
category--can we surprise and be surprised as work is encountered?

Aaron, must we coin phrases to belittle poems?  If work isn't interesting,
why discuss it here?  Couldn't we write about the poets that do compel,
shake and rattle us?  I respect you and your work a lot.  Must we
continually sweat the National Book Awards, as if they meant anything other
than a nice check?

As tiresome and predictable as some responses to posts have become, it feels
like there's an opportunity now to change.  I'd say there are only a handful
of moaners, content to toss their disappointments and  miseries as far as
they can type.  But there are many more here, those folks are completely
outnumbered.  I'm curious to hear from people about this.  What can this
list be?

Jim,

I'm glad you like my poems; as you know, I endorse your whole project. CWHOBB has
opened up whole landscapes of possibility for me. Pardon me, however, while I ---

It seems ironic that you call our attention to "the state of things" -- how things
are bad & could be better.  Why don't you post something positive?  I.e., ignore that
which you perceive to be negative & harmful?  aha, it's not that easy, is it.  My
only intention in posting poems that are textbook-awful is to say--to say
again--something is rotten in the state of Po-mark.  It seems we are saying the same
thing to different ends, however.

Jim, I'll offer you a wager.  You don't criticize the "state of this list" or call
people lazy, mean, dumb, snobby, etc., and I will check all *my* remarks to make sure
they are about "the poets that do compel, shake and rattle" me, or other things that
turn me on.  But for every one of your metacommentaries about this list, I get to
attack something of my choosing.

Do it, Jim!  This is your chance to carry a fella out of the fire on your back!   I'm
serious,

-Aaron

Beautiful & adequate peace or exaggeration, Virginia
my dream is punished with entertainments, Qui refroidit mon

the tomb succumbs to enigma - by flowers in place of a point-of-view.

Nuances struggle against white roses - while you, Virginia, misheard

imagined it Capitalized. In this flight from lions, the detour

not that i wanna weigh in with trashing poets or poetry.  but i
actually LIKE "Bad" poetry, and this aint it.  this addonizio stuff
is neither very bad nor very good, it's not interesting in any way.
in the spider poem, which is completely banal, i expected a
killer-diller last line to redeem it; this is something this type of
lyric poetry often relies on-- a punch-line to redeem its previous
overly talky exposition.  but the last line was the lamest of all.
nothing interesting in the language, and the only thing i cd get from
it, in terms of content, was that, hm, mother shares some of
daughter's anxiety about the natural world of love and sex and
relationship that is obviously writ large in the foregoing.  so what.
i don't see anyone taking any risks here; this isn't "deceptively
simple" --it's blatantly simplistic; it seems made to order for an
eighth grade class of 50 years ago just learning the basics of
"reading for larger meaning."
as for the poems below, i can't believe anyone can use the phrase
"dark continent" without some knowledge of historical context, and
that someone would try to write an ode to a red dress that so lacks
the energy that would have to be its sine qua non or its raison
d'etre.
however, there are a lot of poets associated w/ iowa who can and have
done much better.  i can't think of any right now, cuz i do't care
about that type of stuff.
again, i love bad poetry --or what others here would call bad poetry
-- but it's got to be interesting.

honestly, i don't believe that good poetry necessarily comes out of
workshops or that it takes an mfa to recognize good poetry.  good poetry
comes out of life, recognition from not only reading, but listening.

My experience with workshops has been only tangential, however this =
experience has led me to one (I think) generally accurate conclusion:  =
that the workshop model fails to obtain the rigor of a "poetics" model =
(as pursued by Buffalo, Temple, and probably some MFA programs, maybe =
Brown?).  That is to say, I've never found a workshop that can =
articulate (nor that recognizes the need to articulate) the critical =
values upon which they exist, i.e. what is "good work" as opposed to =
"bad work" - Such determinations are self-evident, it seems, to MFA =
programs modeled on some arbitrary interpretation of modernist / imagist =
poetics. =20

Iowa is a red flag term, but anyone who's spent time in Iowa City, as I =
have, couldn't possibly, or couldn't imagine one possibly, extending =
such generalizations any further than some such distinction between =
self-evidence and self-consciousness.  Unfortunately, the former =
frequently disguises as the latter.  Why is that?  [Incidentally, I =
would expect this question to be of they type crucial to discussions on =
this "poetics" list, as evidenced by Kasey and Mike's recent exchange.  =
That it's often not is just one reason I don't turn up here myself at =
times.]

Let me just add to the list of poets doing "good work" (i.e., critically =
engaged writing) and having spent time in the Iowa workshop: Jen Hofer =
and Summi Kaipa.  Both have work at the Kenning website:  =
www.durationpress.com/kenning

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE: A WRITING WORKSHOP - ANNE WALDMAN
TUESDAYS AT 7 pm: 4 sessions, October 22nd - November 12th

Waldman writes, "It is not safety but the unevenness of life that allows
artistic breakthrough. Shaky ground is best when trying to find new ways to
walk. In this workshop, we will play with rhizomic collage, hypnologic
states, investigate living in the "eternal war" zone, perform cross-genre
experimentation & vocalize cultural intervention. Texts for study & respons=
e
will be provided."

Anne Waldman is the author of over 30 books including, most recently, Vow t=
o
Poetry: Essays, Interviews & Manifestos (Coffee House Press) and Marriage: =
A
Sentence (Penguin Poets).

THE POET IN THE WORLD - JAIME MANRIQUE
FRIDAYS AT 7 pm: 10 sessions, beginning October 18
Manrique describes "The Poet in the World" as "a workshop for students
interested in writing poems that extend beyond the realm of autobiography.
We will look at the works of poets such as Walt Whitman, Octavio Paz, Pablo
Neruda, Cavafy, Wislawa Szymborska, Ceslaw Milosz, Agha Shahid Ali, Tomas
Salamun and others whose imagination is deeply personal but also rooted in
politics, history, and issues of national identity. Students will be asked
to write in specific forms such as insult poems, satire, etc."

Jaime Manrique's titles include the novels Colombian Gold, Latin Moon in
Manhattan, and Twilight at the Equator and poetry titles My Night with
Federico Garc=EDa Lorca; Tarzan, My Body, Christopher Columbus; and Sor
Juana=B9s Love Poems, co-translated with Joan Larkin.

***

WORKSHOP - RENEE GLADMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12 PM: 10 sessions, beginning October 12
Gladman describes her workshop: "In this class we will write toward the
middle, that terrain between poetry and fiction where the shape and tone of
the line or sentence is as much an idea about narrative as are the notions
of time, place, and character. Through a series of in-class writing
exercises and discussions the class will imagine and test out those
perspectives of storytelling that work against conventional assumptions of
linear progression, authentic voice, and resolution."

Renee Gladman is the author of  Juice (Kelsey St. Press), and two chapbooks=
,
Arlem (Idiom Press) and Not Right Now (Second Story Books). Former editor o=
f
Clamour, she is currently editor of the chapbook imprint, Leroy.

SURREALISM AND AUTOMATIC WRITING - JANET HAMILL
TUESDAYS AT 7 pm: 4 sessions, November 19th =AD December 10th
The writers and painters of Surrealism drew their imagery from dreams, and
other non-rational states, and practiced automatism. This workshop will
examine the climate in which the movement was born, its philosophy, the wor=
k
of some of its chief predecessors and proponents, and its continued
relevance. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to investigate
Surrealist techniques and make their own attempts at automatic writing.

Janet Hamill is the author of four books of poetry and short fiction: Lost
Ceilings, Nostalgia of the Infinite, The Temple, and Troublante. Flying
Nowhere, her first full-length spoken word CD, with the music of Moving
Star, was released in 2001.=20

Subject:      Chain & alphabetizing
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi Ron,

I've been reading & enjoying your blog over the last week or so, and I
wanted to comment about Chain and alphabetizing. I understand what you're
saying about how alphabetizing removes editorial narrative (the "unfolding
of meaning over time"), and I can't speak for Juliana & Jena, but ... here's
my own take, for whatever it's worth. There are times when reading linearly
produces incredible results--I think it was John Thorpe's Five Aces &
Independence that I first read my usual way, here and there, and then read
straight through to very different (and much richer) effect. But there
usually isn't much in the way of payoff, for me, going through
systematically, even a collection of poems that has been carefully ordered
by someone. I mean, very generally, I tend to skip around a lot *because*
the order really isn't so compelling to me, even in cases when I can see it.
I don't know if that's a disservice to writers & editors, but there is
always that resistance for me. And I think for others, too; Jack Kimball and
I ordered my own book How to Proceed very consciously--but my sense is that
people who read it mostly weren't conscious of that, or read it in their own
order producing their own threads/echoes.

I don't have any more copies of Chain 8 Comics (I gave mine all away), but
looking over the TOC, I'm not sure how it could have been put together to
greater narrative effect *with the material that is included*. I suspect
that had Juliana & Jena ordered things to begin with it would have resulted
in an entirely different selection of material. That they would have wound
up dumping some, maybe many, of the pieces in there--and the result would
have been less loose, more focused, less open-ended, and my suspicion is,
less interesting, finally, or in any case not what makes Chain, for me, most
interesting. What I like most about Chain is its very expansiveness--which I
suspect might not be possible with a more aggressive editorial style.

Anyway. The Comics issue opens with a poetry comic collaboration by Jonathan
Allen & John Coletti, which seems, actually, to be just the right
opening--as what the issue really is, for me, is a meeting ground between
various writers, comics artists and others all working through the medium,
or ideas about the medium, or who are inspired by same, etc. So a collab
seems just right to open things up. But, yeah, I'm reading that meaning into
it. Similarly: I loved how Joe Brainard & Robert Creeley's collab (a kind of
pastiche/spoof of I think it was a Harvard Alumni magazine) is followed up
by F. C. Brandt, Peter S. Conrad, & Rob R.'s collaborative comic about life
in prison--there's a kind of echoing going on there for me. I suppose that
overall the issue is fairly chaotic going through it piece by piece--though,
I do think that people will bring their own meaning to or derive their own
meaning from the order as it stands, if they look at it linearly--which the
alphabetical ordering would seem to discourage. At least, as I go back to
the TOC now and remember what those pieces are, and think of them one after
the other, I find that I'm creating these threads/echoes where none were
(specifically) intended.

I think what you say about how a journal is "best gauged by the writers whom
it brings forward to broader audiences" is interesting and I can see what
you mean, but I disagree, at least with that word "best." I don't for
instance associate any handful of filmmakers with Film Culture nor a couple
of writers with Temblor--it's *the way in which they support and expand
their community of artists* or *how they bring the people & work in them
into dialog with each other* that made them, for me, really great journals,
made them what they were. Likewise, what made HOW(ever) really great, for
me, was not what it may have done for Lorine Niedecker's reception, though
that's great too, but what it did for the reception of innovative writing by
women generally. (I actually don't associate any specific writers with it,
or at least not just three or four--I associate more I guess a whole
tendency of writing.)

Anyway--thanks for the interesting blogs--I love blogs (they're one of my
new favorite genres) and am especially happy to see poets starting them up.
The blog on Sherry's Our Nuclear Heritage was really great, btw ... did
anyone ever figure out if it's still in print & available through Sun &
Moon? I'd love to get my hands on a copy ...

September 18: BAD

Poetasters and laity alike have endured the stultifying experience of
a bad poetry reading at one time or another – and then there are those
who’d say they’re all bad. But what happens when the Bay Area’s best
poets convene to find out just how bad they can be? Sifting through
their own notebooks as well as the annals of Literature, these poets
promise to do their Worst. With Kevin Killian, Bill Berkson, Beth
Lisick, Andrew Felsinger, Brent Cunningham, kari edwards, Norma Cole,
Sean Finney,  Susan Gevirtz, hosts Michael Smoler and David Hadbawnik,
and more “bad” authors to come.

not that i wanna weigh in with trashing poets or poetry.  but i
actually LIKE "Bad" poetry, and this aint it.  this addonizio stuff
is neither very bad nor very good, it's not interesting in any way.
in the spider poem, which is completely banal, i expected a
killer-diller last line to redeem it; this is something this type of
lyric poetry often relies on-- a punch-line to redeem its previous
overly talky exposition.  but the last line was the lamest of all.
nothing interesting in the language, and the only thing i cd get from
it, in terms of content, was that, hm, mother shares some of
daughter's anxiety about the natural world of love and sex and
relationship that is obviously writ large in the foregoing.  so what.
i don't see anyone taking any risks here; this isn't "deceptively
simple" --it's blatantly simplistic; it seems made to order for an
eighth grade class of 50 years ago just learning the basics of
"reading for larger meaning."
as for the poems below, i can't believe anyone can use the phrase
"dark continent" without some knowledge of historical context, and
that someone would try to write an ode to a red dress that so lacks
the energy that would have to be its sine qua non or its raison
d'etre.
however, there are a lot of poets associated w/ iowa who can and have
done much better.  i can't think of any right now, cuz i do't care
about that type of stuff.
again, i love bad poetry --or what others here would call bad poetry
-- but it's got to be interesting.

I agree with Richard Tylr, Beckett is perhaps the funniest playwright
ever. The funniest theorist/philosopher I've ever read has got to be
Slavoj Zizek, and although to my knowledge he doesn't address humour
directly, his writing is steeped in his own humour theory (which is
steeped in Freud and Lacan) and relies on humour as a tool. He's
constantly making illustrative jokes (along with references to popular
Hollywood flicks) and then performing psychoanalysis on the psyche of
the joke. The Sublime Object of Ideology is a good read.

<As tiresome and predictable as some responses to posts have become, it feels
like there's an opportunity now to change. I'd say there are only a handful of
moaners, content to toss their disappointments and miseries as far as they can
type. But there are many more here, those folks are completely outnumbered. I'm
curious to hear from people about this. What can this list be?>
I Reply:
I believe you're missing the point of the list. This is the POETICS list. So we're
charged with talking about poetry. Mostly what I see on this list is enthusiasm for
poetry. I think disagrement on specific poetry and poems is healthy and should be
encouraged. The "Iowa" poem (a term that neither Aaron nor I made up, and a
term that I HATE [as I know several wonderful poets who hail from Iowa] but a
term we're tried to deal with as Bob G. and rova asked in a previous post) should
be talked about as well as other poems.
I would suggest that if the tone of my post (all I did was post an example, as I
was asked) offended you, then perhaps you could post something positive in
response? Why don't you tell us about your favorite poem, perhaps? Then I
promise I'll write about my favorite poem.
I might even choose one from an Iowa grad.
best, and positive to that last,

Cheers to Behrle for smokin some of out of our holes for a re-evaluation.  To
be honest, for some time this list has been a good bulletin board of readings,
new books and magazines, and occasionally insightful obituaries.  The
discussion is usually chatter, and not about poetics at all.  But to each
their own, its a free list and we can choose to not be on it, or to delete to
our soul's content.

That being said, how ironic that there is a call for content on September 11.
What is poetry now?  What is it ever? Might those be topics for discussion? As
J. Laughlin said, "roller skates, roller skates its a bad bad world, whisk us
all up to heaven if its still there."

Just as amusing: a major method of Green grassroots campaigning, especially
on college campuses, was flyers under windshield wipers.  I still remember
my campus littered weekly with thousands of Green party flyers spouting an
environmentalist agenda.

There's nothing that says an anarchist can't vote, though most anarchists
don't. I vote Green because historically the European Greens have roots in
Anarchism. I consider this a compromise.

Perhaps the proper way to preface this mini-report is that we've had grapes
planted here at DreamtimeVillage for more than 8 years.  The first 5-6 years
I was mistakenly under the impression that to grow grapes in a
"PermacultureFashion" meant that one did not need to prune the grapes.  After
the third year we had a bit of a flush & some good production.  After that
the vines took over & I mean took over. Production decreased dramatically &
several diseases quickly moved in because the grapes & vines were not getting
the air circulation they needed.

----

http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/plants/fotos/grapes_on_vine.jpg

In spring 01, out of desperation I painfully pruned each of the plants,
removing less than half of what would normally be removed.  This year there
was good pollination, good bunch formation, little or no disease.  Spied some
of the cottony growth (what is that called?) deep inside of some of the
bunches of the green varieties of grapes.

----


http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/plants/fotos/grapes_what_kind.jpg

Anyone know what ElmerSwenson variety my son Zon is holding?

Very early on in our planting I discovered the work of ElmerSwenson, a 90
year old grape breeder, living in Oceola, WI.  He has released numerous
varieties of grapes selected for the upper midwest, including a red & a green
table grape.  I saw him speak recently & was very impressed with the fact
that he referred to various favorite selections in his breeding program by 7
number IDs & seemed to possess intimate knowledge of each. Quite an inspiring
person to be in the presence of.

http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/plants/fotos/grapes_picking.jpg

At DTV its increasingly rare to get everyone assembled into one activity, but
the promise of fresh squeezed grape juice from "local" grapes is pretty hard
to pass up.  5 vines of LaCroix filled about 3 five gallon buckets. A mixture
of other vines, not quite so productive produced another bucket & half.  One
of the alterations I'm hoping to make to the ultra low tech trellissing
system (metal posts & electric fence wire) is to get the vines higher in the
air.  A lot of the vineyards around here are putting a 12 gauge wire or wires
at the 4-5 foot range.  Main idea is that when you pick you don't have to
bend over.  Added benefits as I see it is clearer space to establish
plantings of smaller herbaceous perennials within the rows.  Ive been
practicing propagating perennial legumes like PrairieMimosa & [Astragalus]
from seed & these might make a perfect understory to a head high grape
planting.

This has to be the funnest part of having grapes living in yr gardens.  What
the pictures don't show is that anyone who has walked out to the orchards in
the last month was also eating from the vines. My personal preference is to
consume fruits & vegetables on site with little or no preparation. I always
get the feeling that the nutritive & enzymatic value is highest while the
produce is literally still alive.


----

http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/plants/fotos/grape_press.jpg

This is a foto of a grape press which ripped 2 fruit bags & split the red oak
wooden pressure plate within the first 4 hours of use.  DreamtimeVillage
would not endorse this product.  We found using our hands we were able to do
better.  If our volume of grapes to process keeps increasing, & I think it
will, it would make much more sense for use to pick & pay to have them
pressed at a local vineyard.  It took 3 or 4 hours of screwing & unscrewing
the grape press to get about 4 gallons of juice.  This of course is why the
most logical thing in the world is to squeeze grapes with yr feet.  I think
an all night rave & a grape pressing operation could have a very symbiotic
relationship.


----

http://www.dreamtimevillage.org/plants/fotos/grape_press_closeup.jpg


This is the first year that we had enough grapes to actually have enough to
press. I would not describe LaCroix as a juice grape but it did not matter in
the least.  We drank about a gallon fresh & the rest became [Wine].

The difference is that when O'Hara did it, nobody else was.  He kinda

you cite.  The poetry was so prosaic, so nonchalant, that most critics and
poetry connoisseurs of the day did not consider it poetry at all, but rather
a violation of the genre.  That he has been imitated ad nauseum proves two

with langpo.  Best, Bill

Okey dokey.  Here's my two cents.  There are many poems written in what some

plenty of hokey drivel also.  And there are many language or visual or

The Strong Wind

The hair of the women
is whipping around
in the strong wind.

In the strong wind
there is gesturing
on the street corner.

The simple daily actions
have a greater urgency
in the strong wind.

In the strong wind
one sits in the car
with the windows up.

The whole sky of clouds
is moving
in the strong wind.

In the strong wind
the young tree is
bending painfully.

Even the tough old tree
is tilting
in the strong wind.

In the strong wind
the edges of the people
are blurring.

Some bodies are
remembering
in the strong wind.

Kasey,

Here is a biographical reaction. As a more or less habitual insomniac, I hate
the last half line, "and we wait together for sleep." Nobody waits for sleep.
To "fall" asleep is a strangly active act (involving a risky step on one's
part). You can wait all you want. Why did Addonizio replace fall (a perfect
word it seems to me for the process) with wait? Wait is weighty, with
intimations of dying. Addonizio is pumping the poem (whereas O'Hara is
deflating his, the bleeding corpse as a reception).

Pumping seems to me is the knee jerk impulse of this kind poetry, whatever
it's called.

Shall I wait to sleep on it before i e-mail this post? I think not.

Murat

Leaving aside the nuances of your (important) larger distinction between
"good" and "bad," Maria, I do want to emphasize that on the most basic
level, "For Sleep" strikes me as a dreadful poem indeed.  It is BAD in a way
that admits little or no possibility for appreciation, even on a perverse
negative level.  That is, it's not _Plan 9 from Outer Space_ bad, it's
_You've Got Mail_ bad.  The really depressing thing is that the poem doesn't
seem very successful even within the already questionable terms of what this
type of poem seems designed to do, suggesting that within the high-stakes
world of National Poetry Blah Blah Blah, there are just no goddam standards
whatsoever.  As you say, Maria, there's no payoff, just the most perfunctory
gesture toward a "lyrical close" you can possibly imagine.  I can't even
remember how it goes ... "and then we go to sleep in each other's arms" or
something.  Fifty years ago?  No way!  Those eighth-graders would at least
have gotten some Longfellow to chew on or something.  This is more like
poetry for people who have lost part of their brains in lawnmowing
accidents.

Jim, I generally agree with the spirit of your calls for positivity on the
list, but I do feel strongly that one of the legitimate things we should do
here is look at examples of "good" and "bad" poetry, and speak frankly and
in detail about what precisely makes them so.  In my first post, I laid out
a few straw man examples of ways the poem might resist some of the standard
attempts to explicate its badness, all of which I suggested were in some way
inadequate or incomplete.  There are accordingly at least two reasons that I
feel it's important for us to spend some time staring at this car wreck of a
poem: 1) just because it's a bad poem that has been rewarded, which is cause
for a criminal investigation of sorts; and 2) because in my opinion, we need
to work a little harder at coming up with a coherent poetics with which we
can *defend* our intuition that it is indeed a very bad poem.  It's the
second reason that I think is most important, because it puts both the poem
and our critical credibility to the test.

Right.  The question then, is is there even such a *thing* as "the workshop
model" in some ideal form?  Part of me thinks there must be.  I mean, I
don't care much for Sharon Olds (one of Addonizio's influences), but
wouldn't people agree that on an "objective" level, her poems are "better"
than "For Sleep"?  (The scare quotes, if it needs pointing out, are meant to
keep aloft the acknowledgement that such objectivity and qualitative
conditions are by no means established entities, and that that's what we're
trying to work out here.)  Like Maria said, for instance, one marker might
be a distinctive closing line.  I think of the last line from James Tate's
"The Lost Pilot," which though by no means a generic workshop poem, does
seem to be a key model for a certain type of poem that gets turned out in
them: the poet says that he wonders whether it is the case that something or
other placed him in this world and his dead father in that other world (I'm
reciting from memory, obviously), "or that misfortune placed these worlds in
us."  Now that's a line that sticks with you!  Say what you like about
sentimentality and manipulative rhetoric, etc., but *on its own terms*, that
line is a keeper.  In short, even in the alien world of workshop aesthetics,
there is the potential at least for evaluative criteria.  And such criteria,
as has been made clear, just plain ain't being applied on any level.

Patrick, I'm sorry, could you rephrase the question?  It does sound like a
crucial one, but unfortunately, I'm getting lost somewhere in there,
especially around "some such distinction" and where the former is disguising
itself etc.  I'm not being facetious or anything; I really would like to
engage the question, but I 2 dumm to udnerstand this.

No, yeah, actually, this all fits with what I said, I think--or at least
with what I *meant* to say.  This is all dead-on, and it gets us back to the
question whether some kind of defamiliarization effect isn't after all
necessary in order to induce a requisite level of shock in the reader.  I
don't necessarily mean "shock" like, "Oh my god, look what this weird-ass
poem is saying!" [reader drops book and runs, urinating in terror], just
that on some level the poem offers an out-of-the-ordinary perspective or
something.  Like, in the Tate closer, there's a little reversal there:
misfortune placed these *worlds* in *us*.  Whoah, man, like worlds are
bigger than people, so that's really cool and trippy!  See?  That's all I
ask.  The closest we get to that in the Addonizio poem is ... hmm, well, I
can't really think of anything.  I can imagine a *better* poem about a mom
failing to cure her daughter's fear of spiders, but it would just be a
totally different poem.

Right.

So anyway, where does this leave us in terms of my original question, which
was: are there useful guidelines, founded on principles of *construction*
(as opposed to opinions about what is or isn't a good *topic* for a poem,
for example), that we can apply to poems like Addonizio's?  What Maria and
Patrick and Mike and I and others have been saying seems to point in such a
direction, but can we formulate it a little more precisely?  Or are there
reasons I'm missing that that's not such a desirable goal?

I'm thinking of something along the lines of Pound's Imagist do's and
don'ts.  Which is ironic, I guess, because they are part of what's
responsible for the whole workshop crap festival in the first place.  But of
course if they were really being attended to in the manner in which they
were intended, we wouldn't have poems like "For Sleep."  We'd have something
else that would probably be pretty scary, but it wouldn't be that.

Hi David, I think this must have been "Syncope" by Catherine Clement,
which discusses the laugh in terms of it being a rip into

Patrick, I'm sorry, could you rephrase the question?  It does sound like =
a
crucial one, but unfortunately, I'm getting lost somewhere in there,
especially around "some such distinction" and where the former is =
disguising
itself etc.  I'm not being facetious or anything; I really would like to
engage the question, but I 2 dumm to udnerstand this.


The Iowa Writers' Workshop (never sure where the apostrophe goes, =
really) was established just about the time nearby Chicago was churning =
out, via "foreign correspondent" Pound, the equally arbitrary activity =
of "Imagisme."  Although from Imagism to Vorticism, Pound articulated =
his poetics as it evolved into, finally ..., the Poundian notion of =
self-evidence - the investiture of the Poundian "image" - seems to have =
seeped into what we may find to be the original (IA being the first of =
its kind) "workshop model."  But Pound's notion, then, of the work of =
the "image" was a station on a train to the Cantos, finally ...

So, to clarify if I can, the wholesale adoption of "self-evidence" that =
I have found endemic to poetry workshops (again, my experience is =
limited) seems to me an arbitrary interpretation - i.e., outside the =
fact of Pound's utilization of that notion of "image" as a part of the a =
process, leading finally ....   That said, if we can spot a poem's "own =
terms" or its own critical values (as you have been attempting with the =
so-called Iowa School poems in question), the poem is self-evident (to =
that degree, the degree to which it articulates / offers critical =
values):  evident to the self and evidence OF the self.  Here is where =
we put on our disguises.  It's time for evaluation, with a view to =
turning the poem to the goodness of doing what it says it should.  It's =
generosity is just an arrogant attempt to prove how much it can afford =
to give away.  Anyway, this kind of evaluation, not yet really founded =
on anything but "self-evidence" (itself yet to be articulated: 'I don't =
know much about art but I know what I like'), FEELS like =
self-consciousness.  Since, by this time, I can't not believe that the =
goodness of the poem is my own goodness (my self living up to its =
"word"), and the confessional mode that often, but not always, goes with =
my poem becomes a risky descent into probable chaos (pathos) wherein my =
uncontrolled sincerity will in no way resemble art, which is so entirely =
dissembled as to be self-evident in principle.

I mean, what the fuck is that?  Um, as in:  we read someone's poem and =
decide it wants to do X.  In order to do X, which is self-evident, it's =
X after all, and everyone knows what X means or how its multiple =
connotations come about in the context of Y, Z, etc, so - In order to do =
X, that poet to which X relates as an intentional object must become =
conscious, through my "critique," of X.  And X is identical, =
self-evident, to poet.  Therefore, poet is suddenly self-conscious.

But why?  Why is this indentification so compelling?  What is the point =
of mastering X?  Who's "teaching" said workshop?  And what do they =
represent as a "master"?

up and down the sides of my throat, breathing
a descent into the male-storm (involving

write you this, my beloved: in the hereafter,
white men crawling over continents (not theirs)

Rich leather skies stretch like plastic surgeons'

the ceiling billow with moneyed eyes. She

slinks up to her water bowl, no syllabl'd chain
choking grief from her erosion, while
these what are poets publish and sheaf the gulls
strained through hurricane libido.I'm coming, she

tells them, no longer allowing logic to scarve
a trail across her throat.

it seems clear that the linebreaks in that particular ohara poem
benefit the poem by the effect of headlong rush and shock that they
produce as the macabre sense of the poem emerges from under its
nonchalance.  in fact i used to teach this poem along w/ walter
benjamin's baudelaire essay on urban shock.  ugrads got it right away.

what a nice way to counter 9/11 madness with abundance and
organicity.  there are wild concord grapes down on the cape here, and
my sister harvested them. not enough for jelly, but enough for,
maybe, a nice condiment for meat or ice cream. a nice compensation
for the paucity of beach plums this year.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="ISO-8859-1"

ELEVATOR 4:  THE GRID PROJECT

ELEVATOR is pleased to invite you to participate in the fourth project in
our artist=B9s book collaboration series: THE GRID PROJECT. THE GRID PROJECT
is an international inter-linguistic inter-textual writing project that wil=
l
culminate in the publication of 40 artist=B9s books produced by artist Amy
Stalling.  Books will be made of wood and will contain two texts:  a paper
book of all poems produced by the participants, and a unique Word
Interaction Device (WID) produced by the artist.  The WID resembles an
abacus consisting of four wires strung the length of the book which hold
wooden cubes in the form of a grid 4 cubes wide by 9 cubes long.  Each WID
is unique in that it recombines the textual grids of four poems from the
collection; four being the number of usable text-faces per cube (the other
two, because pierced by wire, will not contain text).  A picture of the WID
prototype can be viewed at

http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mjk/grid_project_prototype.html

If you would like to participate in this project, please respond to Mike
Kelleher by October 1, 2002.

SUBMISSION FORMAT

Respondents will be sent (electronically) a printable and rewritable
Microsoft Word document containing a grid consisting of 36 boxes, each 3/4=B2
X 3/4=B2, which is the actual size of the cube-faces in the WID.  You may
print the grid out if you would like to work on it by hand or you may type
text inside the boxes using Microsoft Word. Each box of the grid may contai=
n
no more than one word, which means that no poem can be longer than 36 words=
.
You may choose to write your poem crossways (4 spaces per line) or long-way=
s
(nine spaces per line). Boxes may be left blank at the poet=B9s discretion.
Blank boxes will be represented by blank cube-faces.

All text-faces in participants=B9 grids will be reformatted using a font
chosen by the editors and the artist, which means that whatever
typographical formatting (or personal handwriting style) you employ to fill
in the boxes in your submission is likely to be lost in the final
production. Words that do not fit across the face of a cube on one line wil=
l
be broken up.  If you recognize that a certain word is too long and have a
preferred means of breaking it in the square, please indicate this by typin=
g
or writing it in the desired configuration on the grid you submit.  A good
rule of thumb is that words longer than six letters will likely be broken
up.  If your word will not fit completely on the face of the cube using the
font we choose, we will ask you to re-submit a substitute.

We encourage submissions in as many different languages as possible. Texts
will be published in their original language.  If you want your work to
appear in translation, it must be translated before you submit. We will
publish the text in the form and language in which it is sent.

Submissions must be received by November 1, 2002.  Electronic submissions
are encouraged.  Snail-mail submissions should be sent to Mike Kelleher, 63
Ashland Ave., Buffalo, NY 14222, U.S.A.

Participants will receive a copy of the paper book, and a 10% discount on
the artist=B9s book. The opening/reading/party will be scheduled some time in
the spring of 2003 in Buffalo.  Participants are invited to attend and to
participate in a live reading of the texts.

I don't disagree.  Bias is strategy.  But if we're privileging quality work,
we all know that no one methodolgy owns the lock.  Only the worst kind of
crank would suggest that the Iowa method (whatever that is), or langpo or
vispo or repo aesthetics is incapable of producing a quality poem.  My guess
is that most listmembers are smarter than that.  And let's not forget there's
no accounting for taste.  But it can all make for some enjoyable give and
take.  My own tendency is to use the syrupy stuff for toilet paper.  Good for
the hemorrhoids.  But that's just MY digestive system.  Best, Bill

No, I won't wager.  I'll call it like I see it. Pettiness should be met and
challenged. And it's wrong of me to bring up what is obvious to us who
receive these e-mails?  Aaron, bitch and vent endlessly if you want.  But
you're better than that.  And if you do, prepare to back it up.
"Textbook-awful?" C'mon.  A different tradition with different readers.
Your poems and mine wouldn't suit them, do they spend time carving us up as
"textbook" examples of what's wrong with poems?

What I'm discouraging is thoughtlessness and sniping, not necessarily your
posts, John. What Ms. Addonozio ever did to anyone here is beyond me.  Her
poems have been selected at random for crucifixion here.  And to prove what
exactly?  That some folks write mainstream, accessible, risk-free poems?
News? No. It's the literary equivilent of pulling her pigtails, so pick on
someone you're own size.  I like Kasey's take on her work--live and let
live.

We'll go over this again when the National Book Award nominees are announced
down the road, and identical e-mails will be sent...why wasn't Innnovative
Poet X or Innovative Poet Y nominated for this award that goes to
mainstream, accessible, risk-free poetry collections?  Duh.  We've made our
beds, and they're great beds, and the grass isn't actually that much greener
anywhere.  Let these circles be broken.

I wasn't offended.  It's depressing some discussions here neither enlighten
nor promote.  I did post 3 poems yesterday (3 more poems than Gallaher did),
which possibly may not have been positive enough:


A POEM FOR VIPERS
By John Wieners

I sit in Lees. At 11:40 PM with
Jimmy the pusher. He teaches me
Ju Ju. Hot on the table before us
shrimp foo yong, rice and mushroom
chow yuke. Up the street under the wheels
of a strange car is his stash--The ritual.
We make it. And have made it.
For months now together after midnight.
Soon I know the fuzz will
interrupt, will arrest Jimmy and
I shall be placed on probation. The poem
does not lie to us. We lie under
its law, alive in the glamour of this hour
able to enter into the sacred places
of his dark people, who carry secrets
glassed in their eyes and hide words
under the coats of their tongue.



This hung over my desk until recently.  These lines: "the poem / does not
lie to us.  We lie under / its law alive in the glamour of this hour..."
break my heart.  Call this one a favorite of mine.  Couldn't someone damn it
by labeling it "a domestic scene with lessons
embedded in [it]?"  Domestic for J.W., at least.

Haven't seen anyone here argue that I'm way off base, and it's difficult for
me to understand what's healthy or didactic about trashing poets.  And why
was Kit Robinson singled out?  I really like his poems.

It's possible that some people here are just fucking jerks who care little
about other peoples' poems, or poetry, or discussing poetry.  But ought this
list be a place where we vent professional, political frustrations?  Get a
dog, tell the dog how wronged you were that American Poetry passed you by,
that you don't get the respect you deserve.  Tell your dog that you should
be teaching at University A or University B, or how bad a poet everyone else
is who is up for this award or that.  I just don't see why that's healthy or
important.

I was particularly turned off by the back and forth about THE BEST AMERICAN
POETRY 2002.  I was excited to recommend the anthology, I really felt it was
worth checking out, that Creeley had really done something special.  What
followed was pointless begrudgery and sniping.  There are great poems
therein, you are doing yourself a disservice by dismissing them.  It is a
great step in a right direction, not business as usual.  There's no pleasing
some on this list, who don't want to be pleased, who cannot enjoy the
success of others, who remain here only to jerk-off.  Allen Bramhall's
recent cut-up mocking my BAP 2002 e-mail was a particular low-point.  Thanks
very much for that.

That people read Ms. Addonozio's work is a start.  That she's popular makes
it more likely that they will grow to take a chance and pick up the work of
John Gallaher or Aaron Belz, and I hope they do: both are very talented.  I
started reading poetry with very mainstream, accessable, risk-free poets.
That didn't stop me from finding the kinds of work I wanted to read, write
and publish.  Kim Addonozio is not the enemy, she's not an example of
"what's wrong" with poetry.  There's an enemy in bitter poets' hearts.

I'm really very tired of who's been driving this car.  If you're gonna bring
it, bring it.  If not, think about everyone's time that goes to waste on
you.

I don't believe there's a real disagreement here.  Like you, Maria, I'm not
interesting in prescribing anything, *really*.  I think I was just using th=
e
language of prescription because I sensed that A.'s poem was begging for a
certain kind of guidance in order to achieve a certain kind of effect, so I
put on what I thought of as a typical workshop-leader hat.  So my
prescription was bracketed, if you like.

I don't know if I'd say "*far* more," but sure, ok.  Even there, however,
the "wisdom" in question seems at best vague, again largely because the
speaker avoids formulating any real insight toward the end, opting instead
for an easy "lyrical" image of mutual insomnia.

Yup.  And more on such formal aspects when we get back to O'Hara in a

Yes, that "sublime terribleness" has a lot of energy, and I'm tempted to sa=

that *all* "great" poetry draws on this kind of flagrant badness on some
level.

Sure!  I'm sure I could pull a dozen examples off the web in about 30
seconds, but since I'm lazy, I'll just write one myself:

"Hod Carrying"


Around eleven the hod
gets real heavy.  Sweat
builds up on my unibrow
like toad slime, and I

swipe it off in a big wet arc
at Larry, who flinches
and calls me dickweed.  The boss
doesn't care: he's reading
Anais Nin in the trailer,

feet up on the plastic fan,
eating one of those expensive
hoagies from the yuppie deli,
drinking a strawberry Snapple.
He's into some real steamy
passage with chicks going at it
together, slathered in French
perfume, moaning about destiny
or some such.

              Me, I got my
hod to carry, and a stale
bologna sandwich waiting
in my lunchbox.  I got....


Oh, lord, I can't go on with this.  You get the idea.  What "female" poems
like Addonizio's and "male" poems like the above have in common is their
liability to be perceived, as Addonizio's and the others that have been
posted here were perceived by you, as precisely that: gender-essentialized
to the point of ludicrous stereotype.  Or, similarly, class-essentialized,
or race-essentialized, etc.  There, of course, we're getting into subject
matter, which I said I wasn't going to touch for now.  So back to "form,"
and back to O'Hara:

I haven't read the Benjamin, but I have my doubts about the argument that
line breaks do the kind of semantic work that you're suggesting.  In fact,
this was one of the main points I wanted to address in my first post.  I wa=
s
just having a similar conversation with Patrick Herron, who produced a very
detailed, careful formal reading of O'Hara's poem, offering an analysis of
the valence of each line break.  My response was that I just don't buy it.
O'Hara's enjambment produces a general sense of breathlessness, but my
suspicion is that it could be re-enjambed in any number of roughly
equivalent ways, and the effect would be pretty much the same.  (In fact, I
would suggest that this is true not only of O'Hara, who is known after all
for working in broad emotive strokes and what-the-hell formal arrangements,
but of someone like W. C. Williams, in a poem like, say, "Red Wheelbarrow":
how's that for heresy?)  Of course, because we're all used to the poem the
way it is, many of us would probably express some dissatisfaction with the
new arrangement (myself included), but I think ultimately this would be out
of *sentimental* attachment to the old format.  Here's part of what I said
to Patrick:

"What matters for O'Hara is the tension between two different tendencies: 1=
)
the tendency to break off at a "natural" spot (roughly iambic-pentameter
length, say), and 2) the tendency to disrupt that "naturalness" by enjambin=
g
in unlikely spots.  The specifics are superfluous.  What matters is the
larger gesture."

And then I wrote:

"In the case of 'For Sleep,' there is no larger gesture, because there is n=
o
pattern to break with in the first place.  There's just a big blob that is
supposed to be shaped vaguely like what somebody once thought a poem should
look like."

I know you're not arguing that each line break has a specific degree of
informational content or anything like that, Maria--and I believe that your
students "got" something from the poem that was meaningful as a result of
its lineation, as well as other aspects of the poem--but some readers *do*
want to make such arguments, and arguments like that are often deployed
against poems like Addonizio's, and my starting position has been that this
approach is untenable.  In sum, I want to argue that Addonizio's poem (and
poems like "The Hod Carrier") are bad, and I want to use principles of
structure to do so, but I'm not satisfied with what I see as the existing
models for such criticism.

I want to respond to Patrick's smart comments on self-evidence and
self-consciousness, but I've run out of morning goof-off time, so that'll b=
e
next on my agenda.

Patrick,

I was confused at the same point as Kasey in your earlier post.  Now your
explanation leaves me befuddled.  Let me see if I can piece together part of
what you're saying.

I don't recall Pound using the term "self-evidence," but I do think I get
what you mean in pointing to Pound.  For example, in _ABC of Reading_, EP
often puts two poems side by side, asserts the superiority of one, but
(frustratingly) doesn't ARGUE his position: ergo, the notion that the
superiority of the one poem is "self-evident."  I don't get the connection
of this critical practice to Imagisme, however.  What about the image makes
it, in this sense, "self-evident," either in Pound's thinking or in yours?

You seem to call into question Kasey's use of the notion of a poem's "own
terms" as some kind of critical vantage-point.  While I can also see where
Kasey was coming from in that post, I think this notion might interestingly
bear critical examination.  Don't really have time now to set down my own
thoughts on the matter, but perhaps that's part of where ~you're~ trying to
go with this. (And perhaps you could say more about on what basis you would
evaluate poetry if we reject the notion of self-evidence....)

I can't abide the word "goodness" in a discussion of poetics.  I realize
you're probably using it in a heavily ironic way, but still....

I'm confused but almost-getting-it up to this point in your argument, but
where you really lose me, here as in the earlier post, is with your notion
of self-consciousness and how specifically it contrasts with self-evidence.
For example, you say that the old saw 'I don't know much about art but I
know what I like'-- which you say is an evaluation really founded on
self-evidence-- "FEELS like self-consciousness."  Huh?  I thought the point
of your earlier post was to try & suggest the distinction between these two.
  Am I misreading you?  And what kind of critical methodology would claim
that something "FEELS" like another thing from which it's supposedly
distinct?  (I'm not trying to put you on the hot seat, & I know you were
just crudely setting your thoughts down, but still....)  Maybe it would help
if you attempted to define these terms, and particularly
"self-consciousness."  Or maybe you're making shorthand reference to some
term in a text which isn't ringing any bells for me....

By the way, I would translate 'I don't know much about art but I know what I
like' into Workshop-ese as: 'This works for me.'  Perhaps the latter cliché
suggests the horizon where self-consciousness & self-evidence meet.

And yes, you put the apostrophe in the right place.

Best,

Mark DuCharme

(I can't believe I'm going for the "terminal" second post of the day, but
here goes....)

Murat, since you mention both O'Hara & sleep, & the hollowness with which
Addonizio's "waiting for sleep" rings, I thought I would throw in a "sleep"
poem from FOH which I think will also satisfy Kasey's criteria of "strange."

Best,

SLEEPING ON THE WING

Perhaps it is to avoid some great sadness,
as in a Restoration tragedy the hero cries "Sleep!
O for a long sound sleep and so forget it!"
that one flies, soaring above the shoreless city,
veering upward from the pavement as a pigeon
does when a car honks or a door slams, the door
of dreams, life perpetuated in parti-colored loves
and beautiful lies in all different languages.
Fear drops away too, like the cement, and you
are over the Atlantic. Where is Spain? where is
who? The Civil War was fought to free the slaves,
was it? A sudden down-draught reminds you of gravity
and your position in respect to human love. But
here is where the gods are, speculating, bemused.
Once you are helpless, you are free, can you believe
that? Never to waken to the sad struggle of a face?
to travel always over some impersonal vastness,
to be out of, forever, neither in nor for?

The eyes roll asleep as if turned by the wind
and the lids flutter open slightly like a wing.
The world is an iceberg, so much is invisible!
and was and is, and yet the form, it may be sleeping
too. Those features etched in the ice of someone
loved who died, you are a sculptor dreaming of space
and speed, your hand alone could have done this.
Curiosity, the passionate hand of desire. Dead,
or sleeping? Is there speed enough? And, swooping,
you relinquish all that you have made your own,
the kingdom of your self sailing, for you must awake
and breathe your warmth in this beloved image
whether it's dead or merely disappearing,
as space is disappearing and your singularity.

--Frank O'Hara

Subject:      THE WEST WIND REPLIES TO SHELLEY
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

THE WEST WIND REPLIES TO SHELLEY

Great title! Clever! And I really like the opening stanza, too. But I think
you could maybe strengthen it with a couple of "action words" (I didn't want
to be *too* invasive, so I just put in spacers like <> where you could add
something of your own!):

O Shelley, the giant <ACTION WORD> of glorious romantic poetry history
You, whose eternal <ACTION WORD> power influences those who read you
Had idealized me, a wrongly portrait of <ACTION WORD> god

I mean, they wouldn't have to go right there, exactly. Those are just
suggestions.

I really liked the next stanza *a lot*. Especially Ceres. Ceres! You only
mentioned Ceres once, and I'd like to see more of Ceres, actually! I added
some to what you wrote:

Ceres! The winged Ceres-seed cannot be blown without Ceres' wing
The Ceres-seed cannot be grown without the "Ceres" presence of Proserpine
(aka Ceres)
The bounteous Ceres, but not I (other-than-Ceres), can sentence the
Ceres-fate of Ceres-growth

Maybe I went overboard with Ceres? I mean, you know. But maybe sprinkle a
few in there.


II

I love how you numbered the sections like this. It makes it clear that
there's this ... like ... "shift." But, okay, I'm lost when you write:

O Shelley, the ghost of fantasized ode of me

Huh??? I think you need to be clearer there. "Ode of me"? Oh, wait, no. You
mean that's the West Wind speaking? Okay. Yeah ... I see that now.

You, whose potency [Great noun!] affects those who heard you
Had mistaken med [typo?], a mighty destroyer and preserver

... like ... *computer* pre-server? Because then you'd need a hyphen there.
I think those are just called "networks."

The sky cannot be stirred without the clouds dancing [great images!]
The lightning can not struck without the Pegusus with thunder belt
The almighty Zeus, but not I, can accompany the rainfall

That is *such* a powerful stanza. It's like, couldn't you really just end it
there? "Rainfall." Because then it ends with that, like, falling of the
rain.



III

See, because you're going to start wearing on your readers' patience if you
go on too long. I think, though, that this one is okay.

O Shelley, the great admirer of the unseen west wind

But, isn't all wind unseen? Why point this out????

You, whose interpretation of ocean had misled those who pray you
Had addressed me [Great use of IRONY!], a supposing ruler over the roaring
ocean [EXCELLENT!]

The wave cannot abstract without the hard surface of coast
The crevasses cannot be cleaved without the order of Neptune
Sun, water, weather, but not I can control the marine

I admit I'm a little confused by the above. "hard surface" is *hard* ... and
"crevasses" is *soft*. Especially if they're being *cleaved*.



IV

O Shelley, the fanciful player of imagination
You, whose lyre had instructed many those who inspired by you
Had kindly made me a musician, of the divine natural

I like the above stanza VERY MUCH. But, I had this idea--couldn't you
substitute, like, a "regular joe" name for Shelley up there? Because it's
kind of getting repetitious. So, like:

O Sam, the fanciful etc.
Julie, whose lyre had etc.
Had kindly made Mark etc.

Or am I being ...? Well, never mind.

The forest cannot sing without the leaves branches suffering

*Powerful.*

The lyrist cannot be sound with the absence of Euterpe

??? Did you mean Europe?

A splint, a drop, a tick, but not I, can stroke the great inspiration

Now, see, someone's going to think that's a *sexual* metaphor. Like, to
"stroke the great inspiration" ... right?


V

O Shelley, the romantic lover of west wind
You, who had made my glorious, as Homer had attempt me
to blow Odysseus back to Ithaca
Had acquainted only this:
when I am present, spring will not be far behind

I'm having a problem with this last stanza. I mean, you're going along
there, through sections I-IV, and you end up ... here? With this? Isn't it
kind of a let-down?

I did a rewrite, just a tweak here and there, to "pump the level up" a bit:

O Shelley, the romantic lover of west wind
How do you like it?
MORE MORE MORE! How do you like it, how do you
Like it? MORE MORE MORE! How do you like it,
How do you like it? MORE MORE MORE! (Fade-out.)

Mark et al -

Let me try to clarify my clarification.  I can't find the Pound I'm =
thinking of, but I like what you brought in - that's part of it.  "hard =
light" and "clear edges" is another.  But the "image" for Pound changes =
with respect to the Vortex and later the Ideogram and can't usefully, =
for us, I think, be divorced from the context of that evolution.

My categories:  "self-evident" and "self-conscious."  I identify =
prototypical workshop methods with the former and prototypical "poetics" =
methods with the latter.  Both methods presume a loose sense of =
reflection.  In poetry writing workshop one reflects on the objet d'art =
before them in order to craft a better one, one that is as "good" as it =
can be, one that "works for me."  But one is also the "author" of said =
object, if not necessarily (though frequently) the subject of it as =
well.  In this situation, one relies on critical values, one's own =
(i.e., "finding one's voice"), but always by reference to two things =
which must articulate and maintain those values, the poem in question =
(aka, "said object") and the "master" (aka, workshop leader).  My =
contention is that the master's task, identifying and maintaining these =
values is sometimes imposing (too much in reference to their own =
arbitrary values) and sometimes simply impossible (how do you maintain =
critical values in a workshop situation when those values are yet to be =
articulated?).

I wound up seated on a train from NYC this spring next to a poetry =
workshop student who was describing her experience in her program.  She =
went on and on regarding the techniques each instructor used to maintain =
critical values and thus imbue them.  I finally asked whether or not the =
instructors ever required the students to articulate what these values =
are (i.e., what makes "good" instead of "bad" in any given instance).  =
She didn't understand my question either.  Turns out we'd both just seen =
the Richter show at the MOMA, so I thought I'd ask her what she thought =
was so "good" about it.  She was utterly unable to fathom the question =
and its presumption that a set of critical values could be articulated =
even for the sake of argument (i.e., not for the sake of actually =
composing a work).  Ultimately, all she could admit was that the =
paintings existed, and their existence was self-evident.

It seems to me the space (generic, I suppose) opened up by the notion of =
"poetics" confronts the same questions but in the sense that it goes =
beyond the work as an object and considers the processes of composition =
and appreciation.  In that sense, it is self-reflective (those =
considerations themselves being processural, in flux).  Now, what I =
didn't yet address is the reliance on one's own critical values in =
either a workshop situation of one in which some "poetics" model is =
assumed.  The authorial process comes into question with respect to =
creative (or first) causes - but if we are impatient with the notion of =
creation ex nihilo, we adopt a Deleuzian model of the passage of =
utterances, deflecting intentions, disputing motives in principle.  =
Poetics privileges the disputation of such principles - workshops may =
never question them, since they are already the workshop's raison =
d'etre.  To the degree that an author identifies with their motives, =
they become culpable for the work done on behalf of those motives - this =
is the level of critique I association with workshops.=20

Culled this from an unrelated project - and posting here (viz. Poundian =
self-evidence) because I can't find my copy of "A Few Don'ts" and hope =
someone can and will post here.  I think the IA WW was established in =
1926?

Pound came to London in 1909, aged twenty-four, joining up again with =
Hilda Doolittle (H.D.) upon her arrival in 1911, aged twenty-six.  That =
same year, art critic of the Chicago Tribune Harriet Monroe founded the =
little magazine Poetry, naming Pound the publication's "foreign =
correspondent" (Monroe, Vol. 1 and Jones, 16).  H.D., in the meantime, =
had established a deep relationship with another poet in London, the =
British Richard Aldington, and when the two brought their poems to Pound =
for criticism in 1912, it was as a function of the prankster that he =
announced to the poets that they were "Imagistes," while it was as a =
function of the sponsor that he insisted H.D. sign her work, "H.D. =
'imagiste'," and that he wrote to Monroe, the administrator,=20

 =20

I've had luck again, and am sending you some modern stuff by an =
American.  I say modern, for it is in the laconic speech of the =
Imagistes, even if the subject is classic ... This is the sort of =
American stuff that I can show here and in Paris without its being =
ridiculed.  (cited in Jones, 17)=20

 =20

Pound admitted to having pulled the prank that was the naming of =
Imagisme, and whose primary tenets as a practice are found in Pound's =
own particular poetics as early as 1908, or, having "invented [it] to =
launch H.D. and Aldington"  (Pound cited in Jones, 19).  Aldington's =
poems, selected and published with the moniker "one of the 'Imagistes'," =
apeared in the November 1912 issue of Poetry, with H.D.'s work turning =
up (as "H.D. 'imagiste'") in the January 1913 issue.  Two months later, =
amidst a good deal of speculation as to where these "Imagistes" had come =
from so suddenly, and what they hoped to acheive (not to mention how =
they hoped to acheive it), Poetry published F.S. Flint's "Imagisme" =
along with "A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste," written by Pound himself.  =
Asked to define Imagisme, Pound does so negatively.  By August of that =
year, Rebecca West's article "Imagisme," published in the New Freewoman: =
 An Individualist Review from London, was feeding "the only clear =
account" of the movement back to the British audience, introducing long =
quotes from "A Few Don'ts" and "Imagisme" from the March issue of Poetry =
by declaring, "there has arisen a little band who desire the poet to be =
as disciplined and efficient at his job as the stevedore" (West, 86).  =
But Pound, functioning as the sponsor of Imagisme, was its most vehement =
critic, as evinced in an article written for the Fortnightly Review in =
1914 when he had already left Imagisme behind for what he was calling =
Vorticism:=20

 =20

The imagist's images have a variable significance like the signs a, b, =
and x in algebra ... the author must use his image because he sees it or =
feels it, not because he thinks he can use it to back up some creed or =
some system of ethics or economics ... (cited in Jones, 21)=20

 =20

In other words, the Imagiste runs the risk of utilizing the image out of =
proportion to the aesthetic, what is seen and felt;  "the author," =
proper, will not succumb to the inordinate use of the image that Pound =
saw interlopers as embracing.  Not only, as with Aristotle's description =
of analogy in the Poetics, may one "apply an alien term, and then deny =
of that term one of its proper attributes," but one might ascribe =
additional attributes that the true Imagiste would not (42).  In a =
letter to the USAmerican poet Amy Lowell, who was swiftly moving into =
the London Imagiste scene, bent on out-sponsoring the movement by way of =
proposing an annual anthology to be titled Some Imagist Poets, Pound's =
sense of losing his grip on the implications of his prank is evident.  =
It gets away from him by virtue of the fact that his means of =
administration were being usurped by Lowell's infamously deep =
pocketbook, supposedly offset by the democratizing of the movement =
which, in reality, was merely the transference of a poetics Pound had =
already put behind him.=20

 =20

I should like the name "Imagisme" to retain some sort of meaning.  It =
stands, or I should like it to stand, for hard light, clear edges.  I =
can not trust any democratized committee to maintain that standard.  =
Some will be splay-footed and some sentimental.  (cited in Jones, 22)

Kasey,  I think what you say here:

> "What matters for O'Hara is the tension between two different tendencies: 1)

> length, say), and 2) the tendency to disrupt that "naturalness" by enjambing

is correct, but for what it's worth, FOH's unpublished letters include one
to an editor (can't remember who, Don Allen?) where he rather meticulously
corrects the linebreaks in a galley version of his poem.  So, yes, the
larger gesture, but that larger gesture was something he seems to have
been quite serious about.

"Hod Carrying" is my favorite poem of the day, I think it may even be
"sublimely terrible."

Mark,

Yeah, that's how trying to sleep feels like. A great hubbub.
I had never read (I think) this O'Hara poem. How wonderful and strange it is,
that referrance to Restoration tragedy. Was that the 18th century version of
Camp?

Perhaps next time I'll try the inside of a car to fall sleep? I'm flying to
Seattle tonigh for a short trip. Perhaps I'll fall asleep reading O'Hara's
poem.

Thanks.

Murat

I still think there's some value in this thread, so I'm going to keep
posting on the dead horse. And I'm sorry, this's my longest post.

I agree with Jim Behrle here, when he says:

<Pettiness should be met and challenged.>

That is why we must--why I think it is our poetic duty to--look at, and
comment on, as much of the art that is out there as we can. Art
should be met and challenged, just as you say posts to this list should.

Jim Behrle says:

<What Ms. Addonozio ever did to anyone here is beyond me.  Her
poems have been selected at random for crucifixion here.  <snip> It's
the literary equivilent of pulling her pigtails, so pick on someone
you're own size.>

I think that Kim Addonizio is our size. She writes poems and puts
them out into the world. In my view, poems are attempts at bringing
the world to itself. To bring it into its beingness. So all art, in so
attempting, should be taken seriously enough to give it a public airing.

To several readers on this list, KA's poems don't help us live in the
world. And to my view, poems such as this one of hers are not wasted
time, but a fundamental argument of what poetry is for. I have to
admit, the world she depicts in this poem on sleeping troubles me in
its, to my mind, overt simplicity and unqueried associations. If people
take the simplicity in her poem seriously, to salve their day, then they
can easily look to more, I believe, truthful work (like Rae
Armantrout's work from the BAP, if you'd like an example), and say
it's too much work, too difficult. The existence of Addonizio's poetry
works directly against the possible existence of Armantrout's. The
worlds compete. I believe it is our duty as poets to work with these.
To evaluate them. To be their advocates.

Jim Behrle writes:

<It's possible that some people here are just fucking jerks who care
little about other peoples' poems, or poetry, or discussing poetry.
<snip> There's no pleasing some on this list, who don't want to be
pleased, who cannot enjoy the success of others, who remain here
only to jerk-off.>

This, I believe is fundamentally untrue. I'm distrustful of blanket
condemnations (even when using the word "some" people). Calling
people names hurts their feelings, and works against the tone you're
wanting to set on the list.

By the way, I look forward to getting a copy of TBAP 2002. Some of
my favorite poets are represented there.

Tonally yours,
  JG

Subject:      WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE POET (insert name)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Hello everyone.
I'm starting to put together a new little magazine called WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE POET (insert name).  Sort of a detective magazine, researching information about a particular deceased poet, as well as looking for anyone who might have their own information to share about the poet's life and/or their writing.

The first poet of interest is Merle Hoyleman.  She published one remarkable book in 1966 titled ASP OF THE AGE, Ashphodel Press.  There were only 326 copies printed, so you can imagine the difficulty in getting your hands on one.  I had the good fortune of reading a copy from Jonathan Williams's private library while visiting him a few months ago at his Jargon Society in North Carolina.  Wish I could quote her for you right now, beautiful lines, mysterious.

She lived in Pittsburgh, where I plan on visiting soon, after nailing down her last address in an attempt to find someone in the neighborhood who might have known her, or at least known of her.  I've exhausted all other forms of research with Pittsburgh about her.  Taking a bus there to see the house is about all I have left.

Jonathan Williams and his partner Thomas Meyer have already been a big help, lending their personal accounts of this wild woman poet.  Jonathan went to Pittsburgh to visit the poet at her house a couple times in the 60's.  Many of the folks who knew her no longer exist, James Laughlin for instance, although I am grateful to the New Directions editors who have allowed me to view the poems LETTERS TO CHRISTOPHER, by Merle Hoyleman, published in one their New Directions Annuals some decades ago.

If anyone out there has any information about Merle Hoyleman or her work, and would like to submit a few pages to this new magazine, I'd be delighted to hear from you.  There are so many talented and exciting poets who fall through the cracks over the years, and it would be good to resurrect their work, or at least exhume their vanishing histories for a glimpse or two.

Thank you all,
CAConrad,
Philadelphia

hi.  i sent that last e-mail, subject line "WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE POET (insert name)" a bit too hastily.  noticed a bunch of typos, and problems with the information, and wondered if you could simply NOT post it, please, and i'll submit something to be posted another time.

thank you,

Jim, I'm really just seconding what J Gallagher wrote in response to you,
but feel compelled to ask in addition, who in world are you talking about
here?  Surely you should identify these "fucking jerks" out of courtesy so
they might defend themselves.  If, for example, I was one of the "fucking
jerks," I'd want the opportunity to explain how my own comparison of
Ashbery and Addonozio was something other than masturbation.

Look, I know you to be a smart, kind and affable guy, and I surely don't
want this thread to get flamey -- believe me, I've been there with close
friends before and it sucks.  The fact is though that I think you're way
off the mark in your ire here.  There are *very* good reasons to discuss
poetic value, and if Addonozio's poem was chosen arbitrarily - as it
self-admittedly was by the person who chose it - that doesn't make it any
less useful to the goal of trying to describe competing poetic
methodologies.  The notion that we can all just get along writing our
whatevers just doesn't suffice, if we think of a poem as an action with
any agency attached to it at all.  I think people on this list have very
good reasons for liking the poems and poets they do, and many of them can
talk informatively and at length about those reasons.  If there's some hot
air along with it, well, hell, welcome to mother earth.

Warmly,

Mike

The day is full of starring
softly almost eagerly at leaving, expecting
tomorrows welcomes’: the eye of

take you only so far – the next

part of the waiting. And the nights
in Philly, too hot to sleep
University area, precious
intellect, cling close to me, for I am
to travel far off. Yet from any
distance, ever to reach, any
what to call it; final destination.

Not a continuos arrival. But
    eternal. Turn off lamps.
Or did you stay late into
the twilight of morning. One last
hello, to put down in journal. Or
have all friends left
already …

Familiar faces
in every other town. You
think, someday, again
Let’s go there. And why
Not. It might happen,
even though as you close
your eyes, only the memory
of water, flashes before

any time was even there. And
you know; you think so little
of promises. Only knowing
thinking it – for later.

worry maybe, but mostly
it is the end – someway
it all falls into place

you start the engine.
Watching your

Our lives, at times so intertwined

aren’t those feelings,
memories so close
yet so far off, when
you are leaving to go
somewhere. Thinking
This is it. This is it.
This is what I’ve been
practicing

for this? What this.
Moments shared
with friends. Through
a silence that was
never there. Still Maybe
could it have been so
You were that sound.
‘Could I?’ say you.

I gather some people were upset by my last post, so I'll offer a =
qualified apology.=20

I spent 30 years working days and nights in high-risk neighborhoods.  I =
also did a fair amount of recreation there. I've seen more violence than =
the average person in the course of my work and play. In 1994, when =
Connecticut made the national news for its drive-by shootings, my job =
usually had me traveling to within a block of where the shootings had =
occurred the previous evening. As a case worker, I routinely had clients =
threaten me. Several of them were later arrested for murder. In these =
environments, you learn to use language that doesn't offend people or to =
use rough language to hold someone at bay.=20

In short, I was speaking from my own experience, and the environment =
I've lived in. I can't apologize for my own experience.  I will say that =
I'm sorry if my language shocked anybody on the list, but I also wanted =
to say something online that would wake people up to the consequences of =
their own words.=20

The person whose words I chose as examples was just one of many who =
rsortd to name-calling. His words just happened to be the first that =
came to mind when I posted earlier.=20

Name-calling, however, is not the only problem I see on the list. In the =
course of heated debates, I've seen some people on the list insult each =
other's intelligence and competence in ways that could make a person =
lose control. This list functions as a public place. When one person =
calls another person names or insults a person, it embarrasses the =
person in front of  as many as 800 subscribers. I think, when a =
discussion reaches that point, that it should continue on backchannel.=20

And, for the person who envisioned a playground fight emerging, at my =
age I don't get into fights at recess. I would want a ring, gloves and a =
referee.

I try to respect people's ideas on this list, whether I agree with them =
or not. I haven't been insulted, myself, but I've been very aware of the =
sting others on the list must feel when they take a shot from someone on =
the list. I'm writing in their defense, not mine.

Bill. What do you think of C Bernstein's essays? The one that interests me
(as well as he oes in A Poetics) is Writing and Method there he does - and
think this is the point Bernstin can be strongely critical and even caustic
but he is by and large trying to see that all the various schools contribute
into the poetic so to speak: the syrupy he maybe would put into a poem that
has what he calls "polyvocality" now I was doing just such a poem except
that Ive halted while I go through Pound's cantos (and also think more about
what I'm f=doing if anything) and I'm using a few books eg Cookson's and
anothe book (more recent )  (I've read The Pound Era)..but the point is we
need to study all these guys and I havent been through the cantos (the list
of what I havent read and feel I should is very long). But certainly I can
see that Pound  was, in his (the) language itself, very conscious of the
need to "toughen up" but his language is quite direct, cuts like a diamond
and so on: yet can be suddenly lyrical: Pound is almost pre-empting what
Bernstein calls for: the fragmentations and so on...the very idea of the
image, of the ideogram: and the mant 'voives" in so many languages....that
could lead to a poem in ALL languages incorporating all cultures and of
course in a sense The wasteland was one of the first cooperative efforts as
Pound shaped it structurally: clearly he influenceed many many writers,but
in particular Creeley, Olson and Zukovsky (he ignored Stein I
think -interesting that W H Auden used Steinic language in The Orators which
is a fascinating poem) but Zukovsky (by and large is more fascinated  I say
MORE - wih etymolygy and the permutations of words and of meanings and
codings and transliterations etc) the hard edge in him comes out in those
austere lyrics  "80 Flowers" (but in both ppersonal also gets in there
tosome degree: rferences to his family and so on)..... now how many students
of Iowa (I'm not sure where it is you guys have so many states, the US is so
vast....) (I remember we used to get the Nat Geog. and seeing the fields of
corn in Iowa: I'd love to go there one day.....) and some of "A"  is
brilliant: another work I want to look at in more detail: but even Eliot was
agin' the mush (its hard not  to slip into _the poetic_) but Williams of
Paterson is maybe a better model. I read "The Book of Questions " and for me
it had some fascinating moments but there is too much abstraction, too much
vagueness: if someone can counter-convince me I'll have another look) I also
feel that that is the problem with Robert Kelly's work but I believe (what
little I've seen and heard of it eg via mark Scroggins's book on Zukofsky)
that Ronald Johnson's Ark is a great work - another huge American poem!! -
but it was expensive on abe and I havent looked for it lately -

I think (what I think of as) the best of the Language poets can mix and
interplay with "mush" (or semi-mush) and "the technical language" as
Berrigan writes in one of his sonnets " I too read the technical books"
(something like that)

I think I'm basically in agreement with you Bill on this one! Except that eg
a young friend showed me some of his poems and it was very hard to say: now
this my friend is just too syrupy!  He needs to study a big range of poetry
(he's young enough to catch up) and to practice and self-criticise....I on
the other hand am a bit lazy: that's why I wanted to get hold of that (quite
basic ) book called "Creative Writing" as when I "restarted" writing it gave
me some excellent "exercises" ...if I was younger I'd go to somewhere like
Columbia to get a grip on all the "BIG" works and so on then go to an MLA
school or whatever they are but reserve the right to re-churn it all (not
reject it all)...I dont know what this Iowa school is but there are/is a lot
of poetry that is very popular and the writers are widely published but they
are basically just not very extraordinary...I think the "badnesss" is in
part a philosophical-political-poetical problem as much as any questionof
talent (some of the writers are very intelligent eg in Fence).  Another
example is that I sent some poems to an editor and he acepted one (now
that's good ) but the poem itself I dont think is as "radical" as I'd like
to see - the editor in question is quite perspicacious - but...what I'm
getting at is that ultimately editors can restrict one's work: who and how
would Allen Sondheim's complete work (can it ever be said to be complete -
is the term now redundant in the Sondheimian era that is upon us? And I'm
thinking also of the obviously huge amount of online vispo etc) be
ppublished or what mag would put one of his  poems in : one alone would mean
nothing without the others" somewhat like the other long american
poems...although Alan is not consciously doing an epic I dont think: but
there is an neo - epochal look about it!!  So maybe we have exhausted
"normative" poetry...some of the language poetry is starting to wear a weary
look...but the best endures i ha' nae doot!     Cheers, Richard Taylor.  (If
I've wanderd please forgive an old windy man in a corner!)

But Jim. I say things that I would say to your face: but not to some guy
who - good man as he might be - simply would not understand the subleties of
the politcal situation. I wouldnt swear at people or shout at them or try to
hit: might get heated in discussions: but its a waste of time telling a dog
it shouldnt bite you: so a lot of those guys who want to or have the ability
to shoot you: well that reflects the bad state of your country: and mine,
there are too many people with guns (every day over here (Aotearoa or New
Zealand) just about,there's another killing which was unheard of pre
Rogernomics (read Thatcherism or Reaganism)) .... more likely though one is
likely to receive a bunch of fives, but that doesnt mean that one shouldnt
speak up when one feels strongly, and one feels the other  person might
listen. Now in the anniversary of  S 11 people have to keep the discussion
going: otherwise you buy into a lot of crap the media feed you and certain
prominent politicians: but, yes, personal abuse is not good.

Another angle: "sticks and stones may break my bones but words shall never
hurt me is a chant I heard as a child"....powerful as words are I think that
what's said is said and what's done is done. An attack on someone's ideas is
not (or the attackee) shouldnt let it matter as the attackee in question
needs to have a strong self: that means you can concentrate on the issues.
Paradoxically it might be good that we cant get too close to each other:
gives ups a freedom to say all sorts of crazy things....someone is probably
right now writing a thesis on:

 "The nature and pre nature of the chocolate ontology and the trans slipping
dialcritical dialectic of computer social dialogue and cybernetic social,
(given the alienated pre-romantic pre-slide) and the politics of distance
(as finicked and fined by the negation of the new alienation as found) and
the otherness (consumated or Other) of the electronic bunch of fives with

Okay, so I'm saying to myself, I can't believe you're writing to that
list again, why can't you control yourself, but here I go again.
First of all, I greatly admire Jim Behrle's utopian spirit.  But,
mostly I wanted to write about Kim Addonizio because I actually know
the woman.  I haven't talked to her in like 20 years, even though, as
far as I know, she still lives in the Bay Area, but she and I studied
together at SF State in the early 80s.  San Francisco in the early
80s was a hotbed of the intellectual/theoretical rigor that Patrick
Durgin praised the Buffalo Poetics program for.  The classes that Kim
and I shared at SF State were with Kathleen Fraser, so we were
reading Carla Harryman, Mei-mei Bersenbrugge, Lorine Niedecker, and
we were learning about Lacan and the French Feminists.  While the
other tenured poets at State at that time were not people I would
subject myself to, Barrett Watten taught a course there at that time,
as did Michael Palmer.  And this was before MFA programs ruled
poetry.  The poetry community was flooded with panels and talks and
serious discussions.  There was a sink or get rigorous feeling to the
whole scene.  The pressures to be experimental and intellectual were
enormous.  In a way, the fact that Addonizio, one of the founding
editors of Five Fingers Review, could come out of that scene and
continue to write the sort of poetry she's writing, she's heroic, in
a way.  It's not that she doesn't know better, she's made a conscious
decision to go in this direction--and the direction that she's going
in, I don't think is born out of the workshop poem, but from 70s
feminist poetry.  It was the same sort of stuff I was trying to write
in my early 20s, and part of me feels resentful that I stopped

Yes, we all think essentializing is bad, but, honestly, how many of
us can honestly say we never essentialize ourselves?  I've been in
feminist group therapy for years, yet I'm still ramming my head
against internalize female cliches that are very destructive.  I
think most people most of the time are essentializing wildly.
Setting that aside, when it became clear to me that writing 70s
feminist poetry was no longer valid for me, I didn't then become an
experimental poet--I turned to prose mainly because of the issue of
content--I was then and I still am committed to in-your-face female
content.  This sort of content is obviously important to Addonizio,
so I imagine a young woman in 80s San Francisco faced with some
serious decisions about what to do with her poetry.  Given the
disregard of female content that still rages in the experimental
poetry world, I can appreciate Addonizio's decision to go the
narrative poetry route.

One of the most painful aspects I've experienced in teaching young
female poetry students is that many of them are aching to have more
content in their poetry, but content is seen as tainted, and so they
write these obscure poems that they're yearning for people to
understand, poems that are unnecessarily oblique because they've been
taught that transparency is the great evil.  Anytime I've helped one
of them find a way to incorporate more female content--without
throwing away interesting formal impulses, I've felt a kind of thrill
of victory.

Kasey, when I read your poem, the parody of male cliches, I see that
it turns on the absolute ludicrosity of a man reading Anais Nin.
Whether or not this was a conscious decision on your part, it's plain
that you expect your "readers" to find the very mention of Nin as
hilarious.  It's not that I don't sympathize with this, but you'll
agree the poem would be radically changed if he were reading Henry
Miller.  Again, it seems to me, that female content is a cause for
radical derision.

Best,
Dodie

Dodie, in her very useful recent post, wrote this:  "San Francisco in =
the early 80s was a hotbed of the intellectual/theoretical rigor that =
Patrick Durgin praised the Buffalo Poetics program for."

I don't remember praising Buffalo for intellectual rigor.  If I did, I =
was stating a preference between the two models, but I have to imagine =
this preference anyhow having never attended a workshop (as I said, my =
involvement has always been "tangential" at best).  I merely wanted to =
offer a distinction.  And the distinction was intended primarily to do =
something like what Dodie did - to partially dispel the myths and =
stereotypes ascribed to Iowa, Buffalo, etc.  The generalities I offer =
are meant to exceed any possible application.

I should say that I do feel fortunate to be at Buffalo and "in the =
program," especially now.  But to say that the kind of questions I =
propose central to "poetics" is the kind most often pursued here would =
be to ... well, lie.  Those questions are, when brought up, able to =
flourish into full-blown problems here, and that's the best you could do =
in gradskool, ain't it?

Maria--

I keep trying to think of how to answer your post about the wild poet
tribes but I cannot which is primarily due to the deprogramming
procedures instituted when I was introduced back into some form of
mainstream society in the early 90's.

Sometimes when the authorities have not noticed my lack of ingesting the
medication for a few days  I am almost able to remember the entire tale.
The problem is that I cannot tell which pill is which and one of them is
wellbutrin which if not taken makes me forget everything that I would
remember if I stopped taking the rest of them. I think they already
figured on me coming up with the brilliant idea of not taking meds so
all of the pills are the same color.

Kim Addonizzio wrote a blurb for one of our books recently for a poet
who is not a graduate of Iowa. It was not Kit Robinson even tho he did
write

the seemingly esoteric answers
I seek
are only available

with reference to
the library of sleep
then the questions arrive

My favorite rejection is when I mention poems that are better by the
author who has chosen to send us poop. Then I invite the author to come
to Ohio & read for us. Two authors read last year under this form of
rejection. I think they both understood that I was rejecting their poems
and not them personally, even if they were from Iowa, a place where
things are stereotypically characterized as being taken that way.

Be well

wouldn't it be nice if, instead of so much haze
hanging over the list referencing the hazy state of
the list (which is rather artsy fartsy, when you think
of it), we actually worked toward understanding one
another?

heh...i'm amused to see kim addonzio so discussed==in
school i had a graduate workshop wherein the text was
co-written by addonzio...i thought most of it was a
crock of shit (she actually discusses SURREALISM in
the book, and offers methods for producing SURREAL
poems...and me, i've never been able to tell the
difference between surrealism and the mundane
quotidian...)
of course, this was at kent state...not known for its
embrace of innovative poetics (though i hear creeley
was there for a few days after i left)

Apologies. Frustration has gotten the better of me this week.  My angry
attempts to make some of the conversations here more civil have been
extremely counterproductive, which I regret. My first post yesterday was
heated, but I stand by what's written:

>It's possible that some people here are just fucking jerks who care >little
>about other peoples' poems, or poetry, or discussing poetry.

My line does not call anyone on this list anything.  It may be an enraging
line to some, but no one here is implicated and it's a statement of
possibilty, an unlikely one I hope.  Occasionally posts leave me scratching
my head, or worse, with flames coming out of my ears.  I'm not sure why some
post what they do.  I know these lines were haymakers, I knew what I was
doing when I wrote it, I remain behind them.  Still, I ought to practice
what I preach.

If I hurt Aaron Belz or John Gallaher with this line, or other lines in my
e-mail, I'm very sorry.  They weren't meant for them: I enjoy them and their
posts.

It is unfair to gang-tackle poets of any stripe who are or are not on this
list simply for being a different kind of poet.  That should have been more
clearly stated.  I did enjoy Kasey, Maria, Mike Magee, Patrick Durgin, Mark
DuCharme, Murat, Bill Austin and others in their productive and
well-thought-out takes on Addonizio's work.


"What the Dead Fear" by Kim Addonizio


On winter nights, the dead
see their photographs slipped
from the windows of wallets,
their letters stuffed in a box
with the clothes for Goodwill.
No one remembers their jokes,
their nervous habits, their dread
of enclosed places.
In these nightmares, the dead feel
the soft nub of the eraser
lightening their bones. They wake up
in a panic, go for a glass of milk
and see the moon, the fresh snow,
the stripped trees.
Maybe they fix a turkey sandwich,
or watch the patterns on the T.V.
It's all a dream anyway.
In a few months
they'll turn the clocks ahead,
and when they sleep they'll know the living
are grieving for them, unbearably lonely
and indifferent to beauty. On these nights
the dead feel better. They rise
in the morning, refreshed, and when the cut
flowers are laid before their names
they smile like shy brides. Thank you,
thank you, they say. You shouldn't have,
they say, but very softly, so it sounds
like the wind, like nothing human.

from www.alsopreview.com


This is neither the greatest poem nor the worst.  It is just a poem, that
thing we do that brings us together here.  It is, under different
circumstances, placements and sounds, the kinds of poems we all here write.
When poets here carve Addonizio's work up, it feels like I could be next, or
any of you could be. That upsets me, I profoundly dislike it when I sense
bullying.  Ought we have keen discussions of poetics?  Yes, we ought.  But
can work a little harder, say something more interesting and less
dismissive, less pugnacious?  I believe that we here can.  This group ought
be held to high standards, there are incredibly thoughtful and smart people
here, and much to be learned.

There are also people who post who infuriate me.  Should I call them names?
No.  Should I grow up?  Yes, I should.  When poets are attacked here, I
sometimes feel attacked.  Mine is an open aesthetic, I believe strongly to
be open-hearted to the work of a great many, very different poets.  That is
not shared with everyone on this list.  There are some on this list I admire
as poets but not as people, and the opposite.  I ought not to let that turn
me into the kind of poster I most despise, and that's what sometimes
happens.  I ought to be more thoughtful in making my points, I would urge
others to do the same.

There are poets here who ought to grow up, too. I will continue to challenge
them.  Grumpiness and narrowmindedness are relentless foes of innovative
poetry in my opinion.  Also, many conversations here do add to our lives as
poets, which I resolve to more affably help along.

"What the Dead Fear" by Kim Addonizio


On winter nights, the dead
see their photographs slipped
from the windows of wallets,
their letters stuffed in a box
with the clothes for Goodwill.
No one remembers their jokes,
their nervous habits, their dread
of enclosed places.
In these nightmares, the dead feel
the soft nub of the eraser
lightening their bones. They wake up
in a panic, go for a glass of milk
and see the moon, the fresh snow,
the stripped trees.
Maybe they fix a turkey sandwich,
or watch the patterns on the T.V.
It's all a dream anyway.
In a few months
they'll turn the clocks ahead,
and when they sleep they'll know the living
are grieving for them, unbearably lonely
and indifferent to beauty. On these nights
the dead feel better. They rise
in the morning, refreshed, and when the cut
flowers are laid before their names
they smile like shy brides. Thank you,
thank you, they say. You shouldn't have,
they say, but very softly, so it sounds
like the wind, like nothing human.

This is neither the greatest poem nor the worst.  It is just a poem, that
thing we do that brings us together here.  It is, under different
circumstances, placements and sounds, the kinds of poems we all here write.
When poets here carve Addonizio's work up, it feels like I could be next, or
any of you could be. That upsets me, I profoundly dislike it when I sense
bullying.  Ought we have keen discussions of poetics?  Yes, we ought.  But
can work a little harder, say something more interesting and less
dismissive, less pugnacious?  I believe that we here can.  This group ought
be held to high standards, there are incredibly thoughtful and smart people
here, and much to be learned.

There are also people who post who infuriate me.  Should I call them names?
No.  Should I grow up?  Yes, I should.  When poets are attacked here, I
sometimes feel attacked.  Mine is an open aesthetic, I believe strongly to
be open-hearted to the work of a great many, very different poets.  That is
not shared with everyone on this list.  There are some on this list I admire
as poets but not as people, and the opposite.  I ought not to let that turn
me into the kind of poster I most despise, and that's what sometimes
happens.  I ought to be more thoughtful in making my points, I would urge
others to do the same.

There are poets here who ought to grow up, too. I will continue to challenge
them.  Grumpiness and narrowmindedness are relentless foes of innovative
poetry in my opinion.  Also, many conversations here do add to our lives as
poets, which I resolve to more affably help along.

dodie, thanks for this long and thoughtful post.  it occurred to me
late in my own post of y'day that, while i *don't* admire the poem by
addonizio, i might have been participating in a misogynist
discussion, or at least that misogyny was an element in the
discussion, however much merit our poetic insights might have had (i
too admire jim's utopian spirit, but can't pass up the opportunity to
analyze a poem, even mean-spiritedly) --the scene you describe below
helps put things in context.  but there are breathtakingly admirable
"workshop" poets and poems (adrienne rich's work for example), and
this ain't it.  so what, one could say.  everyone's probably written
a few "bad poems," real clinkers, in whatever genre she or he works
in --geez, i know i have.  kim a may be a feminist, but the poem,
unlike, say, those of sharon olds, does not crackle with
transgressive energy, neither in language NOR in its narrative
content.  as you can see, these random thoughts are not organized
into any sustained argument;;; just musings aloud about how to
critique a lame poem w/o being unsisterly or misogynistic.  i guess i
don't see the argument here as being about "language" v "content" but
about what makes a poem succeed or fail on its own terms.  and what
am i doing myself, drawn into this discussion, when i don't
necessarily believe in goodness, badness, success or failure in
poetry? i guess it's the critic in me --less invested in questions of
quality, but unable to stay out of these types of conversations.

and kasey, much as i chuckled over your "male" poem, it doesn't
really count in terms of our discussion because it was *meant* to be
laughably stereotypical.  robert frost could easily have done
instead; though again, he's "skillful" formally.  how about phil
levine?
thanks all.

Here's a poem I just read for the first time recently. It's wonderful.
And a wonderful opportunity to be positive. It's from a chapbook
titled "Matters", by Mark Salerno. It's a follow up to his amazing,
antic, _Method_, from The Figures (2002).

--------------------------------------------
For Everyday Use

What matters most there's your rumpus
delicate simple wedge of winter light
some sea greens are building contrast
as the man in the orange suit directs
traffic in lost doubloons gold slots
this prison cell my lime tree bower
wherein the prelude becomes the power
O blimey the air is a memory of air
or how else to say it she wore a teal
cotton jersey she had small white hands
and finally we could see the underside
of leaves if only to stay the day as subject
in the ongoing vocabulary of telling.

---------------------------------------------
One of the things I admire about this poem is how well I find it aware
of itself thinking as it goes. How, after the "lime tree bower" /
"prelude" bit, we get "O blimey the air is a memory of air". I find
this playful, antic, and fundamentally true to the totality of
experience. I feel a little corner of the being of the world as
revealed itself here. And, as such, we all join "the ongoing
vocabulary of telling."

True-ly.

<< Bill. What do you think of C Bernstein's essays? >>

Richard, I admire Bernstein's work, front to back, with the usual bumps in
the road.  His essays, especially the early ones in Content's Dream,
intrigued me right off the ole wood, er, bat.  My own immersion in
Continental theory and its American perversions made me the perfect audience,
I suppose.  However, in my last book, 5 UNDERWORLD 6, I included a short
critique of Bernstein's "Thought's Measure."  His essay suffers from
imprecision which is most certainly corrected elsewhere in Bernstein's
writings, as I point out at the close of my own piece.  I guess my point is
that critique, even a bit of negativity, doesn't necessarily preclude
admiration.

As for Bernstein on the syrupy, it's certainly not a new idea.  Eliot did the
police in different voices, and some find moments in The Waste Land a tad
drippy.  I looked back through my own work and found one or too borderline
moments.  I do think it's possible to add a dash of sentiment without giving
your audience cavities.  It's not easy to do, and if I may refer to tsetse
once more, such moments really must be earned by the rest of the poem.

Personally, I'm a fan of the polyvocal.  Old notions of unity in
form/content/tone are, well, old.  And Bernstein's poetry is not free of
sentiment.  In fact, there is so much hangover from the New York School in so
much of the work by the original and major language poets that one should not
be surprised to find a bit of sweetums there.  I don't think it overwhelms
the work when it shows up.  Generally, Bernstein seems pretty crafty re:  how
and where to place it.  He's good.

Not one major poet that I can think of, now or then, completely eliminated
sentiment from the work nor, I suspect, did s/he intend to so limit the
expression of human experience.  as just one example, cummings, who was
certainly a technical wizard, is also  quite sentimental.

I lose interest only when the syrup overwhelms the pancake.  As for
abstraction, that's probably a matter of taste whether it's Williams, or
Pound, or Pollock, so I really can't argue with you there.  For me, the vague
and the imprecise can be too different things.  Pollock's drip paintings are
vague, I suppose, but never imprecise.  Of course I may be in violation of
dictionary definitions here, so mea culpa.  Anyway, no artist is without
flaws; that's a given.  Sorry if I didn't get to all of your points, but I've
a ton of work waiting for me today, like most days.  Best, Bill

The Under the Influence Festival from 18-22 September will celebrate the
artistic legacy of the Black Mountain College, which closed its doors in

poetry readings, film screenings, and roundtables showcasing contemporary
artists, performers, and theorists whose ideas and work bear the distinctive
influence of Black Mountain College. Festival participants and contributors

Asheville, Black Mountain and Cullowhee, NC with related events throughout
the month. For detailed and up to the minute information, see the festival
website at http://www.blackmountaincollege.org/festival/.


About Black Mountain College

"For a short time in the middle of the twentieth century a small town in
North Carolina became a hub of American cultural production. The town was
Black Mountain and the reason was Black Mountain College. Founded in 1933,
the school was a reaction to the more traditional schools of the time. At
its core was the assumption that a strong liberal and fine arts education
must happen simultaneously inside and outside the classroom. Combining
communal living with an informal class structure, Black Mountain created an
environment conducive to the interdisciplinary work that was to
revolutionize the arts and sciences of its time."
 -- from PBS's "American Masters"

Black Mountain College numbers among its former students and teachers such
luminaries as Charles Olson, Josef and Anni Albers, Walter Gropius, Jacob
Lawrence, Buckminster Fuller, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, John
Cage, Robert Creeley, Alfred Kazin, Merce Cunningham, Paul Goodman, Cy
Twombly, Jonathan Williams, Robert Rauschenberg, John Wieners and Lou
Harrison.  The college was started in the 1930s by Jack Rice and Theodore
Dreier in association with refugees from the Bauhaus School after the
Bauhaus dissolved under pressure from by the Nazis that same year.

Thanks, Bill. I had a sense from some of your poems online that you knew
more than a little about urban reality.

Jim, thanks for your post. I think it  helped clear the air and clarifed
concersn that a number of people share.

Richard, I agree. It's sad that things have become the way they are. Years
ago, a clever remark would end a dispute. Nowadays, unfortunately, the same
remark might send a stranger into the pedestrian counterpart of road rage.

I would like to further discuss one of the things I posted yesterday.  Why
is divisiveness important to innovative poetry?  There have been many posts
dedicated to bashing Language Poetry, which turns 25 this year.  Is it
crucial to continually, perpetually skirmish between movements of poetries,
and if so, how do poets writing now benefit from these types of hostilities?
  Why isn't "Oh, you know, they do they're thing and I do my thing" an OK
response?  Do our categories completely define what we're up to, and if so,
what are the categories that younger generations of poets fall into?  Just
subsequent generations of movements that have already come?

I would call for more eclecticism and less cliquishness.  We applaud
well-rounded readers in almost every other genre, why should poetry be so
very different?  Good poetry is good poetry.  And even if it isn't good
poetry, shouldn't something be said for giving people's work a chance
instead of dismissing it immediately without a read?  Ought I be able to
read Laure-Anne Bosselaar, Sparrow, Jim Brodey, Richard Hell, Donald Hall,
Lyn Hejinian and Lucie Brock-Broido in the same night without there being a
sense that something is wrong with me?  I own ABBA and Clash records, they
get along OK.  At what point do our aesthetics make us ascetic readers?

no, not anxious!  In our strangely inverted linguistic world nobaody is ever
anxious or depressed or under stress.  just the thought of how we let words
rule our lives, makes me sick, makes me anxious, maybe I feel a poem coming
on!

Maria,

I have no problems with your discussion of KA's poem.  I was just
wanting to talk about it in terms of origin/context rather than
quality.

I recently wrote a piece in which my protagonist is a failed academic
poet (and a miserable adjunct).  Here's one of her poems:

After Vermeer's Milkmaid
by Carla Moran

Hair hidden beneath her linen headdress, breasts bound,
the sturdy young woman holds the pitcher in both
hands, her head tilted downward
prayerlike, her focus singular, milkward.  Light
floods in through the many-paned window, mysterious
and precise, glazing the room with presence.
Last night I dreamt I was pregnant, my insides
luminescent with new life.  Six months--too late
for an abortion, so I held my tumescent belly with both
hands, warmed to my fate, to the task of loving
this young star throbbing within my womb.
The milkmaid pours her milk with such determination.
It is her duty.  Her mind, her soul flows in its whiteness,
warm, fresh, musty-sweet as baby's breath.

In the course of the piece, as she gets angrier at her adjunct status
and aroused by a student (in a very repressed manner) she continues
working on this poem, and it gets very perverse and sick and dirty.
I had so much fun doing it.

Jim, you misread Bob Grumman's post of a month or so ago (who was reacting
to the specific thing posted, not Kim's body of work), you misread Vernon
Frazer's recent post (which was not asking for a fist fight), and you
decided that all a cut up could be is a mocking of you, a small and rigid

so may I suggest that you content yourself posting what zest you can and let
the rocks roll. your use of the term 'jerk off' just accedes to the drama of
this is stage (just as did the scintillatingly snotty remarks I elided from
this email). that term is either applicable to everyone who posts or no one,
and frankly, who cares anyway. Allen

Patrick, thanks for this very scholarly post, which I found fascinating.

You had mentioned you wanted someone to post "A Few Don'ts" (which these
days is available as part of an essay titled "A Retrospect" at the beginning
of _Literary Essays of Ezra Pound_, published by New Directions).  I was
hoping someone else would, cause I didn't feel like doin' that much typing
(and in fact, the entire "A Retrospect" would be much too long to post
here).  But then I thought, why not try Google, & lo & behold I found it
(ironically, on an interesting poetry site I already had bookmarked)--

http://www.poetspath.com/transmissions/messages/pound.html

What's on this site is ~excerpts~ from "A Retrospect" (this text itself I
think is something of a pastiche of early poetics essays).  It is highly
condensed, and it's not clear unless you compare it with the printed text,
WHERE the cuts are.  Nevertheless, many of Pound's core points, and many of
his famous pronouncements, remain intact.  I hope this is useful.

Best,

Mark

Hi Jim,

This is related both to the questions above. I don't think it fully
articulates an answer, but maybe adds something to the dialog. Anyway, these
are excerpts from an essay I wrote on David Bromige's book _My Poetry_ (The
Figures, 1980), which I read as a creative take on the various kinds of
categorization a poet (or any artist) might be confronted with, as well as
an equally creative examination of the site(s) of poetic production &
reception. The passage here is kind of long (sorry) and more than a bit
hyperbolic--but oh well, here you go:

I think my favorite poem in this book is "What the Person Believes Is Part
of the Poet's Make-up: 8 Soliloquants  Each with an End in View Meet Atropos
& Are Stuck with It"--dedicated to the book's publisher, Geoffrey Young, and
featuring "istorian," "aspirant," "one more authentic voice," "anthony
abstract," "objectist," "love-poet," "chainsaw Jack," and "I. Speakes."
Here's the "multiplicity" of American Poetries, all speaking at once, each
singing its own praises, and possibly attempting to cancel out the other
(just like real life?):

anthony abstract: I can't spare breath on happiness
nor any of its relatives, description
of this kind must be distraction--

one more authentic voice: Quail, shotguns, assorted hammering
& sawing, a jackass, jaybirds, dogs, a goat--

aspirant: These hands
need only clasp themselves
for their aspirations to come true--

anthony abstract: For the god I am the shadow of,
once, seared me in that flame,
& sealed my lips. I hurt
to talk.

istorian: The story of his murderer,
lacking means, enamored of his end--

It's not only searing satire, it's a fairly riveting playlet--though I can't
think of many poets who wouldn't, by the end of it, feel at least somewhat
indicted. Is Bromige bored here with the contemporary scene? Is he a
callous, judgmental prick? I don't think he's either. Basically, he's having
fun while closely examining what's on the plate at the Big Table of American
poetry.

Later in the book we get "My Career," perhaps the most "new-sentencey" piece
in the collection (its rhythms are similar Rodefer's Four Lectures, Geoffrey
Young's Rocks & Deals, Hejinian's My Life, and much of Silliman's work).
It's yet another send-up, satirizing not only ambition ("Competition is the
keynote, sometimes winningly justified as cutthroat"), but the terms by
which poetry careers are made (or unmade): "He selects with care that which
is appropriate; he rejects the superfluous; too much discontinuity threatens
the identity of the person." Speaking of which, it also contains moments of
brilliant superfluousness: "It was very dark inside the fish," the second
paragraph enigmatically begins. (Though it might not be entirely superfluous
if we think of Jonah = poet, whale = career. It's a stretch, but quite
likely intended.)

"My Plan," a pastiche send-up of poetics, contains famous quotes from the
likes of Olson and Stein, as well as "anti-theory" statements (perhaps
cribbed from Poetry Flash?) tipped in: "Would you look at the actual car or
only at the specifications?" Reading this, I can't help but think that
Bromige's "plan," at least with respect to the work in this collection, is
the manifestation of a loose, creative scrutiny of the site(s) of poetry's
creation and reception.

My experience has been that, very generally, poets tend to think the
satirist or parodist of poetry "hates" same, or is disgruntled and
embittered. As though no serious poet could possibly have an irreverent,
light-hearted take on the "business" of poetry-making. If there was, in the
80s, a resistance among more conservative types to writing that very closely
examined language, there was even more a resistance--and there still is,
frankly--to anything that closely examines (and does not take overly
seriously) the site(s) of poetry's production and dissemination, as though
the perpetrator were some aberrant acerbic crank. For me, My Poetry is not
only one of the most brilliant and original books of poetry of the 80s,
but--ironically?--the most affirmative book of, and on poetry, I can think
of. And it has more to do with contemporary poetry--not only the
self-awareness of my own generation, but the multiplicity of poetries being
written in this culture in 2002--than any other book I can think of. In
every sense, it precedes us.

FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 13TH, 7:30 PM

"On Painting: Fabian Marcaccio"
Interviewed by Robert C. Morgan

An evening discussion at White Box.  The subject of the discussion
will be the painterly and conceptual concerns that Fabian Marcaccio
brings into his large-scale, paintings.  Marcaccio, who is currently
showing in an important exhibition at  P.S. 1 and at Documenta XI
and who will open a one-person show at Gorney Bravin & Lee Gallery
in October, has for several years been making art intrinsically related
to the discourse on painting. His work brings together elements of
action, abstraction, representation, and environment space.  A painter
involved with cyber-technology, spatial recognizance, biomorphic
imagery,
embodied conflicts, pictorial solipsism, and architectural projections
of
the gesture, Marcaccio has opened a new threshold of meaning that
reinvigorates painting with a mythic terminology for the present.

The interview with be conducted with critic Robert C. Morgan whose
critical writings appear in Art News, Tema Celeste, Art Press, Sculpture

Magazine, and NY Arts.  He is the recent editor of a collection of
criticism
on the video and film work of Bruce Nauman (Johns Hopkins University
Press, 2002) and the author of The End of the Art World (Allworth Press,

1998).

This lecture is free of charge and open to the public.

<DIV></DIV>Thanks, Bill. I had a sense from some of your poems online that you knew

Here's a thought for everybody to explode over: any poem that doesn't
greatly risk sentimentality is crap.

Here's more fun from the Thoughts of Bob G.: I see nothing wrong with a
school of poetry's being acadominant, and wouldn't mind my own kind of
poetry being that.  But I'd prefer that the academy, and commercial
publishers, and grants-bestowers, and the other people who decide whether a
poet has to have two jobs to support his habit, be as eclectic in their
recognition of value as Behrle thinks he is.

Now a little clarification about "acadominant," which is my term, so I get
to define it, and I define it as being considered by the academy the most
consequential poetry around.  It is not necessarily "academic" poetry,
though it is likely to become so, since once it gets the academy's stamp of
approval, students will tend to write it frequently and academically (i.e.,
mechanically, in an effort to do the right thing rather than naturally, in
an effort to do what they must, as many of them will come to do with
maturation).

I occasionally zing the language poets' belief that they are still
outsiders, and don't believe in some of the things they believe in, but I
generally treat them pretty well.  I've never had any problem with the fact
that they do tend to be intellectual and academic-sounding at times in their
criticism, however little I agree with much of it.  What I resent about them
is only what they tend to resent about the later twentieth century workshop
poets, by whatever name, and why should I not?  Perhaps there are poets who
don't mind being invisible, or that their entire school of poetry is
practically invisible, but I have blood and do mind.

But it seems that my main school of poetry is slowly making a place for
itself, even in the academy.  Drop in at The Center for Book Arts in New
York sometime from 20 September through 15 November (28 West 27th Street,
3rd Floor) to see work by artists connected with the anthology of
visio-textual art, Writing To Be Seen, that Crag Hill and I edited last
year, for instance.  Presentations by some of those artists including me
6--8 P.M. 20 September and starting at 7 P.M. 15 November.

I just hope that if "my people" ever become acadominant, the people who
write about us don't ignore that poetries coming to the fore behind ours as
near-completely, and for as long, as we've been ignored by the champions of
language poetry.

Since I'm being Mr. Positive these days, I'll reply in this positive
manner, tone, and key:

I agree with you. (I'm nice, I'm nice, like me, he sobs.) I think poetry
must risk any number of things at any given time. Sentimentality is
but one. But, and here is where I will make my distinction . . . I don't
think poetry should indulge sentimentality.

And I think asking a poem what it's risking, and accusing a poem of
its indulgences, is a wonderful and valid role that a reader should
work toward. I say this at great risk, of course, because I want
everyone to love my poems . . . but if they love all poems simply
because they're poems, why should any poet try very hard to get it
right? And what would it mean to say I like your poems, anyway?


--Love,
       JG

PS. Roses are red, Violets are blue.
      I'll think your poems are great,
      if you think mine are too.

      Amen.

Subject:      Beyond Iowa [long post]

I was going to do one of those detailed responses where I quote a little bit
of everyone's posts from the past day or so, but they've all piled up too
much, so I'm going to be foolhardy and attempt a general response from memory.
 My apologies to those whose comments I will inevitably omit to address.

To begin with, I want to try to restate my primary concerns: 1) that, in a
nutshell, the most frequently encountered critical assaults on "workshop
poetry" seem to me to be operating on some faulty assumptions about how poetic
conventions such as lineation, etc. work; 2) that there *is* nevertheless
something "wrong" with the workshop poem as typified by the Addonizio example,
and that this "wrongness" *can* be got at via a consideration of structure and
process that avoids the formerly mentioned faulty assumptions.

I think Gary S. and Mike M. and Mark D. and several others have made eloquent
and persuasive cases to Jim B. for the necessity of examining poems in a
negative light at times.  I won't rehearse this debate any further here,
except to echo what several others have said: K. Addonizio is a full-grown,
professional poet, and doesn't need protection from critical "abuse."  Part of
being a poet is putting your ideas, attitudes, and habits out on public
display where, in a free intellectual culture, they are fair game for
analysis, approving or disapproving.  The recent disagreements about _Fence_
and Rebecca Wolff that arose from Steven Evans' remarks on the Third Factory
site are a case in point.  I disagreed with Evans' view on that issue, but
felt that his criticisms were perfectly valid as public discourse.  Rebecca
was put, I felt, in a painful position, but she responded to it in a spirit of
intellectual maturity and reasoned debate, because (I'm projecting--she may
disagree) she recognized the necessity of the permissibility of the exchange.

The discussion here in the past few days has been very interesting, and I
would like to see it continue.  Certainly labels like "Iowa poetry" and
"workshop poetry" are reductive and need to be qualified.  But bringing them
up (thanks, J Gallaher [sp?], wasn't it?) led to what I feel has been a
productive and exciting conversation.

The following points, out of those raised during the discussion, are the ones
I find the most interesting:

* Patrick D.'s distinction between self-evidence and self-consciousness.  I
don't have his words in front of me, and even if I did, I'd probably misread
them, but here's what I get from what I remember: 1) typical mainstream
workshop praxis consists of an unspoken consent to subscribe to the notion
that the poem itself knows what it wants to say/be/look like, etc., and that
it's the job of the workshop participants to just sort of go with the flow and
let the magic of composition unfold, whereas 2) "poetics"-based workshop
praxis takes (or *should* take?) a more analytical line on process, on the
social meanings of relations between author and reader, intention and
appreciation, etc.  The first approach posits self-evidence as an effect of
poetic quality, whereas the second posits self-consciousness (both individual
and communal, I guess) as a prerequisite for any climate in which a meaningful
account of quality can emerge.  [Patrick, forgive me if this has already gone
far astray from your point.]  Furthermore, practitioners in the first system
*assume* that their self-evidence model somehow counts as a self-consciousness
model.  This is the part I'm still foggy on, but I'm ready and willing to
pursue it further.  I'm especially interested in how Pound's Imagism fits into
this scheme, because it seems to me to be a poetics that leads both into and
out of the mess, depending on who's interpreting it.  Certainly Pound's own
vagueness (clear, bright edges, blah blah) is to blame for the ease with which
Imagism can become a sloppy commodity, but at the same time there are notions
of verbal economy and precision in there that seem like they could mean
something useful with a bit of teasing.  And certainly they *did* come to mean
such things at the hands of Williams and the Objectivists, no?  I mean, their
innovations wouldn't have happened in the same way *without* Imagism, however
much their poetics is in reaction against it.  I've already dragged this
particular thread all over the map, but one more thing: Amy Lowell's
"corruption" of Imagism seems very relevant here.  Are there any Lowell
supporters out there?  Because it seems like it would be very tempting for
some people to argue that the origins of the "workshop" or "mainstream" model
have their genesis with her, especially when such arguments assume an ongoing
oscillation between experimental methods and their appropriation in "debased"
form by mainstream organs.

* The other thing, which wasn't what I wanted to talk about originally, but
seems like it must be important, is the way in which this debate has
repeatedly been connected to a politics of gender representation.  Dodie, you
pointed out that my hod-carrier poem draws on the supposedly comic
implications of a hod boss reading Anais Nin, in a way that the same guy
reading Henry Miller wouldn't be perceived as comic.  That's funny, because I
originally did type "Henry Miller," then replaced it with Nin, because 1)
"Anais Nin" is more interesting to me as linguistic sound; 2) it seemed to
support the idea of the boss enjoying the lesbian scenes more effectively,
since Miller's own sex scenes are just as often purely hetero; and 3) one of
the things that strikes me as problematic about a lot of "working-class" poems
by workshop-type writers is the uneasy collapse of "literary" discourse into
scenes of blue-collar labor.  DISCLAIMER: I'm NOT saying that no blue-collar
workers are well-read, etc.; I'm talking about what I perceived as an
unexamined impulse on the part of some writers to have their cake and eat it
too: to bring the subject matter of their poems "down to the level of the
masses" while simultaneously displaying their own erudition.  This is a touchy
issue, I realize, but I do think there's a lot of class condescension of this
sort.  Has anyone seen _The Good Girl_?  It has some worthwhile moments, but
it's another one of those films that gets comic mileage out of working-class
characters waxing literary-rhetorical, as if the only way to represent
intelligence in the poor were to turn them into ironically eloquent pastoral
figures.  (I can't recall any exact quotes from the film, but a good example
from another film [which I nevertheless love] is when dirt-dumb ex-con Nick
Cage says in a voiceover in _Raising Arizona_ in the scene where he and Holly
Hunter find out they can't have kids: "The doctor explained to me that her
womb was a barren, rocky place where my seed could find no purchase.")  Now,
Dodie, you may have a point here that on this third level I am counting on
some kind of "ridiculousness-factor" associated with the boss reading Nin, but
at least in my mind the ridiculousness is located in the made-up decision of
the fictitious poet rather than in the actual situation described.  I'm
probably still guilty of a sexist generalization somewhere in that mess,
however, so I'll stop trying to wiggle out of it.  Which leads into your
formulation, Dodie, of "female content," which I'm sure will raise some
hackles.  That central question of the role of "content" in poetry has bred
some of the worst reductive stereotypes of experimental writing, and what you
say about female writers being forced to adopt an abstract idiom out of
embarrassment etc. is HUGELY provocative.  Like, a nuclear powder-keg.  I'm
afraid to touch this one with a ten-foot phallic symbol myself, but I want to
hear more on it.  Oh, by the way, Dodie, that piece you were working on, with
the workshop writer who gradually turns her nice little poem into filthy
smut--where can we see this???  It sounds great!

* This isn't really a point or anything, but I just want to say it before I
forget: Jim, that last Addonizio poem you posted, that one about the dead--I
swear to god that is a Stephen Dobyns poem.  Or, maybe it's not, but it is so
much like a Dobyns poem that I remember reading back in the late 80's, that it
sounds like she just read his poem and decided to write it again herself.  I'm
not making any explicit accusations or judgments here.  It just blows my mind.
 I think it must a poem out of _Cemetery Nights_ that it reminds me of (OK,
yes, I used to read Dobyns).

* What I originally wanted to get at the most: readings in which line breaks,
etc. are adduced as evidence of or analogues to some semantic content: my
hypothesis is that they're generally wrongheaded.  I think this fits in with
Patrick D.'s call for a model of reading in which we get beyond exclusive
fixation on the text as object, and into a model where we also consider "lyric
intention" (Patrick's useful phrase) and "appreciation," and the ways in which
these concerns play into the *process* of writing.  The extended notion of
process that Patrick points toward is one that I'm very eager to keep talking
about, especially as it might lead to a prospectus for a new approach to
"close reading."

Anyone still there?  Over and out.

a talk by Mark DuCharme

"Radical Lyricality."

The term "lyric," applied to the context of
contemporary poetics, often suggests a narrow, even
totalizing approach to form; a dehistoricizing
of the poetic; & a reifying of the lyrical subject.
Yet, poems which could be called "lyrics" continue to
be written in large numbers by many poets who
would cast a critical eye on the politics of "the
lyrical" as it has been received.  How to reconcile
these perceptions, or else rescue the lyric
from the prison-house of its ideological
over-determination?  Don't know.  Ultimately, my
program is clear: "to propose a view of this genre
which
is dynamic rather than fixed, and permeable rather
than bound by shapes & tendencies of canonical
master-texts"-- "a contested & contestible site," in
other words, which "holds the potential to serve as a
kind of laboratory for radical praxis."  Or whatever.



Mark DuCharme’s first collection of poems,
_Cosmopolitan Tremble_, was published in 2002 by
Pavement Saw Press.  His most recent chapbook,
_Anon_, co-written with Anselm Hollo, Patrick
Pritchett and Laura E. Wright, appeared in 2001 from
Potato Clock Editions.  Other chapbooks include
_Near To_ (Poetry New York, 1999), _Contracting Scale_
(Standing Stones Press, 1996) and _i, a series_
(Burning Press, 1995).  His poetry and essays
in poetics have appeared in numerous print and on-line
publications.  He lives in Boulder, Colorado.


Hope to see you there,

The first reading in my new Writers & Teachers series at Barnes & Noble
Westwood (in the Westside Pavilion at the corner of Westwood & Pico) is
Tuesday, September 17 at 7:30 pm.

It'll be the first time I meet these online creative writing students,
and the first time I read my creative nonfiction.  The series, which
will highlight local writers and their teaching methodologies, will
eventually tour Barnes & Nobles.

The Barnes & Noble Westwood readings are not like some other chain store
readings:  B&N orders teacher books, student readers are paid, and there
are *snacks*.

Three Steps Behind
            for Allen Bramhall

misread, misread, asking for work
   content yourself with a fist and body

I suggest your use of roll rigid
   if ever mocking specific pax

scintillatingly posting things posted,
   post, post, you scolding posts!

Jim, Bob, Allen, Vernon don't like
   reacting to the recent steps behind

Kim's not Grumman's, Frazer's anyway
   but sorry who was reading small

you are at least three squabbles
   rocks endlessly of you so ago

term drama accedes frankly
   applicable to a month or you

listservs cut you, you fight
   zest could be up, off and on

so jerk I snotty and let remarks
   to unrewarding everyone be elided

   one cares, but who was not decided

Stephen Ellis should be sent to Iraq to read his poems.  Once everyone was
asleep, Baghdad would be ours for the taking.

Any revolution is bound to become a tyranny. Once upon a time, Langpo was
that revolution but isn't any more - this is a normal historical process &
the new revolution is always coming. I, not unlike many others, keep bashing
langpo but i do own a lot of books written by langpoets. In fact, some of
these books are my favorite poetry books, and I am sure i am not the only one
who feels this way. There is nothing wrong with "bashing" - critiquing is
(and that's what it really is) a very important thing in art because too much
consent generates self-indulgence. I wasn't born in the US and come with a
different cultural baggage, so when i came here i was surprised at how little
people critiqued each other's work face to face, instead of talking about it
behind their backs. That's why we need "bashing" - so that "our  categories
[won't] completely define what we're up to," to paraphrase your own words.

Revoluion is not "bound  become tryanny" revolutions and reforms  ad other
"upheavels gradually pave the way toward a real democracy: such that ther
people control the state not the state the people: the US is a kind of
Huxwellian dictatorship....but the rest of what you say I concur: i dont
think it matters where people derive from we are ultimatley all human and i
feel we should be open, openly critical but not hurtful (so that some
criitcicsm is probably best left out): we dont need bashing but if you read
"Your Erroneous Zones" by DR Wayne Dyer you would be able to see tat we need
to be able to deal with rejection, even "failure" (in a sense there is no
such thing as failure).  We should aim to be. Its better,as Dyer says "to be
a doer rather than a critic".  But we shouldnt fear openness given that we
have compassion.  Richard

the balance of power drifts to the far side of the saloon. when guns bellow,
so do words. the balance of power was merely guessing, but who could tell?
it was a creative moment of endowment, and it would be the ball, rolling
away, its full precious symmetry merely given to gravity. well. the balance
of power could feel gravity, the wherewithal of distraction and attraction,
allowing balance to finds its level. meanwhile, people stood around in the
saloon, waiting to say something. this possible something could arrange
high-flying birds, and mountains so trim and exacting that poetry itself
would be the simplest exhaust. and that is not hope speaking but the
pleasure of balance carrying us thru distracted days and the effort to be
right. Fu Manchu can lord it over his minions, and seep into the edges of a
civilization so intricately bland that numbers would never survive
completely. it's all a matter of confusion, political puddles, the extreme
loss of soundness as one speaks. yes, and it's really just a name we place
on our 'détente', that little world gift we think we invent daily. Fu Manchu
hungers for the usual ball of wax, and Sir Denis Nayland-Smith is no
different. they've got a careful tussle to perform, with surety of
expression a minor outpost among the contributing factors. there is a sigh,
then, as Fu Manchu rereads his latest daunting note to his opponent. it's
all a crock, he realizes, a blighty big crock.

it cries children with the ways of incidence. tours of the scene bring eyes
forward, reverence for words. it is a battle of daylight versus the forces
of night. we wake with rupture and run to school. there are posts in the
way, great hankering inceptions filed under grove, the very idea. so we work
our tails off, biting apples for a quick sense of the tart season. our
escapade warrants a degree of influence, of camaraderie, of just staying 'on
topic', whatever that might ever mean. it is the institute itself, the
nightly pursuit and daily requiem. children are tarnished, sent in spins,
while the delighted auditors take notes. this is processual, and arches over
the language left here, in the background. meanwhile, the whole work looks
looser. community wants its share, a colour bent around the wind. children
are ardent, sure, and lost in many waves. there is a dear exchange, to allow
the fields to clear off night's dewy build up. time fleeces us, cries some
hurt and bewildered person, while the wind increases. the wind takes
childhood and drags it to the top of the sky, where kites and balloons
linger like froth. the day is confused but at least we have the words to
speak, said anyone, uncomfortably. and yet sunshine brings everything
together. when day is done, we sleep in the arms of night. night is a
whisper of words, real words, tho we see them as pictures. what are our
sayings worth? a person can ask, as the sun bobbles in the sky for moments,
a wasted effort. a choice of emphasis becomes the last resort.

1)
yeah, dodie, that was a hoot. where can we see the dirty version,
plus all the in between progressions?
2)
riffing off of your paraphrase of p durgin's characterizing of
"workshop" poetry: my impression of workshop poetry is that it is
very "craft"-oriented, not nearly as invested in process as, say, St
Mark's/ New York School or other approaches that folks on this list
might be more sympathetic to (black mt, etc).  at the same time, i
agree, there is an adamant refusal to examine the social/political
context in which that craft is deployed --thus the sense of
intellectual impoverishment of many workshop experiences --so there's
a peculiar reduction of process and the content of workshop meetings
to "wordsmithing."  there's very little exuberance or spontaneity
--in fact in the workshops i've taught, the creative writing students
seem agonizingly wary of spontaneity (as if it would compromise their
self-image as hard workers, intense about every word, etc), and at
the same time, very little honest analytic rigor or interesting
contextual discussion, in workshop situations, in my experience.

3) for an interesting and fun, if tangential, take on blue collar
poets, see Jacques Ranciere's "Ronds de Fumee," it's about the 18th
or 19th century french vogue for blue collar workers among the
bourgeoisie who patronized them; interesting stuff on the class
position of the poets: part of the poignancy of their "predicament"
was that they were, as it were, trapped in the wrong class; they were
bourgeois souls trapped in workingclass bodies, etc.

Nick. I saw some of your correspondence with Ramon Qureshi and your patience
and concern and interest in his corespondence: but I felt that you "dodged"
the queston of political commitment. I agree re the problem of the rhetoric
etc that arises. But some anger and some rhetoric is a sign of caring about
an issue: and at certain historical times we have to declare where we stand.
Poets are "the unaknowledged legilators of mankind"  (the witnesses I feel)
but there comes a time - now when I say " I am opposed to the US
military-state complex. I'm certain Hussein has minimal nuclear capacity.
Even if he had thousnbad of nukes then why dnt the US  let Iraqi inspectors
into the US? The US has weapons of mass destruction. Its leader is highly
fundamentally religious.. I'm pretty certain (cant prove it no one can prove
or dispove becuase the CIA etc control the information and dominate the
media) that Bush or his mates organised S11.  Pilger writes that about 5000
people are dying daily in Iraq becuase of your country's  (basically illegal
and bullying embargo). Ten years ago the literacy was high and there was a
good economy in Iraq (the US rearrmed Saddam Hussein)....My dentist last
year did brilliant work SHE was from Iraq.  Very gentle and concerned and
skillful.
  I see that Kent Johnson was "kicked off" th List because he wrote and
essay saying: "Is Charles Bernstein a Political Poet"  ...was this hubris by
the major Langpo Guru in reaction to kent's statements? What's going on?   I
think that Johnson etal were critiquing US policy of bombing Bosnia and so
on.  Are freedom's beeing shut down everywhere including the on this List?
When are the Langpos going to free themselves of wish wash: get
real.....that's to say, a "non-political" (nothing is truly I think,ever..or
very rarely are things so) of the politics in certain times is good -
implicated in the languagae questions and so on - but at some point: when
people's lives are at stake.. we have to get political.  This can be
frightening. I remember going onto the freezing works here in the 70s and
showing photographs of the terrrible damage done by US bombs (these were
photogrpahs from British doctors working in the North) now these guys
argued: they all had knives. But I raised these questions. I also argued
with rugby players in 1981 to their faces (re te Springbok Tour rugby toour
of NZ) - sure I was scared at times - but I felt at certain times one has to
act...now I'm not trying to be holier than thou: for a start when I was
battened in the face by the cops in 1981 (it was like a civil war and the
protesters used terrorists" tactics incluodng one guy who flew a plane over
Eden Park when a game was in progress droping flour bombs: and previous to
that there was another pilot who looked like he was going to fly his plane
into a stadium, engineers were secretly trying to assemble surface-to air
missiles to blow the passenger jets with the Springboks in tem (and other
collaterals who cared?) out of the air, and there were plans to assasinate
them ( of course these were rejected by the leadership at the time but it
shows the "civil war" atmosphere that prevailed then). I was filled with
about 25 valium tablets and still scared as hell when we marched against teh
cops and te rugby supportters ina anattempt to stop the last game....But
(more recently) I had in fact made a decision to "ivory tower" myself on
about the 9th of September last year when  things  changed. A big part of me
wants to "retreat" ... once my vision poetry was ( something like John
Ashbery's) of a kind of art that was/is sui generis: I still believe that
 I mean that that is one kind of quite valid poetry practice).

It's true I wasnt anywhere near the towers or NYso its "easy" in a sense for
me: I can understand the fear of Americans and especially New Yorkers: and
the outrage...but we cant all of us stay "outraged"...we need to act, to
speak.

I'm not attacking you or anyone I just want to express some things here: I
felt that your posts around the time of S 11 were very intelligent and compa
ssionate: a lot of mine were semi-crazed and I wasnt anywhere near NY (I'm
of course in Auckland, New Zealand)....but question marks still hang around
re the intersection of politics and poetry: over here John Geraets and
Leigh Davis (who openly "loves " capitalism)  seem to want to avoid the
political realities. Davis enbraces exploitation of the working class and is
on a vast income while posing as one of the "avant garde" and Geraets is
into some obscure French theoretical fairyland.  I wish politics would go
away. But I have not read Johnson's essay but the title puts question marks
up there hanging oer this List and the state of the world.  What is the USE
of poetry? Was the nihilistic side or  aspect Auden right? (for example)
(dont worry I've had a look down into Hades .... )

Sure people might be anxious: but of what? The list is ok as long as there's
debate - even abusive debate. That's what human's do. But what were we /you
I supposed to be anxious about? The invented terrorists or the real ones:
the US state military complex and the clamping down on political freedoms
and human rights in the Western nations or some supposed terrorists   - none
of whom have been decisivelly identified (except for a whelter of reports
and threats most of which is bullshit to keep everone thinnking there's a
need for war - anned to KILL PEOPLE ...MORE PEOPLE) - many so-called are
either patsies or work for the CIA I reckon). the eternally recurring cycle
of bombing by the British (grovelling in the wake of he US, with Australia
and NZ also grovelling as usual) and the US.The lies about the Taliban, the
attacks on Muslims who come from an ancient and great culture and great
nations, the mess the military has made of Afghanistan, and so on....where
do you stand? Where do other's stand. there's and ominous (scared?)
silence.... Bush has threatened to use nuclear weapons for chrissakes...

I wouldnt be wasting time shoring these brickbats in public if Ididnt think
highly of your poetry and thinking.

The Homeland Security Cultural Bureau site is a hoax.

Otherwise, we would actually have an attorney-general who said this in an interview with "Director-General" of HSCB, on the HSBC site --
http://www.hscb.org/ --


>HSCB -Carolyn Parker Mayes: So can you tell us more about the more recent discussions, which led to the formation of Cultural Bureau of Homeland Security?


>Atty Gen. John Ashcroft:Well Tom Ridge and I are avid painters and we share a passion for the arts. Our wives have even started an art collection with several other member of the Presidents cabinet, we purchase works and rotate them among one another's homes. We have attended a few Broadway shows, we attend the opera regularly, La Traviata is my absolute favorite, so yes, we generally just share an interest in the arts. When we were meeting more casually over a few intimate dinners, shortly after his appointment as the Director of the Office of Homeland Security, I told Tom about my passion for linking culture and politics.

>And we agreed, which great civilization has not used its culture to form a mark on the history of the wolrd. Which Empires did not further their cause directly through the use of cultural attachments, whether they be architecture, poetry, sculpture, painting?
>We agreed on all of these matters, so it was a question of convincing our President and despite what many may think, President Bush is very much inclined towards the arts. Of course, he does not have the sophisticated interest in color or the contours of the figure that Tom Ridge and I share, he goes much more for Hollywood, and popular music like Britney Spears, but nevertheless, he recognizes that Elvis did as much for spreading out the tentacles of America, or Jackson Pollack for giving a face to freedom against Communism, as any our great politicians of the time.

...
>HSCB -Carolyn Parker Mayes: Well, we have arrived at the end of our interview, it was a great one at that. Despite our meanderings into many areas, I think our readers will appreciate your candid responses and I look forward to more online chats like this in the future.


>Atty Gen. John Ashcroft: Likewise! I just want to add something for any of the young readers out there. Follow your dreams and if you have a passion for painting like I did, think about it less as some subversion or division from normal patriotic life. On the contrary, realize that you can also paint such lovely things as flags for example, as Jasper Johns did, or military portraits or scenes, as some great painters of the past and present like Leon Golub, Anselm Kiefer, and Jean Louis Ernest Meissonier have done. In short, culture can service this great nation if used in an acceptable fashion, one which recognizes the beauty and power of the all mighty God and the power that he has vested in this blessed land, good night and thank you!


The official site for the Department of Homeland Security is http://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/. There are no references to Leon Golub on this site, alas.

White Box's web site is: http://www.whiteboxny.org/

For further, you may wish to note the appointment of Abe Golam, Director of the Office of Political And Economic Insecurity at http://www.usdept-arttech.net/release_06_14_02.html.
Not a minute too soon, either.

Q: Can "craft" be seen as a legitimate subset of "process"?  That is, can we
consider the kind of local and micro- attention to things like diction,
phonetics, "traditional forms," that goes on (or *is supposed to go
on*--important distinction) in mainstream workshops a valid activity *among
other activities* for a "poetics"-based approach as well?  Should or can
"the processes of composition and appreciation" as applied in a "poetics"
context include a consideration of things such as enjambment, "the image,"
euphony, etc., as they might have been considered by (say) a Victorian or
Elizabethan or Modernist poet?

Q: If we could agree that the above were the case, would we then also be
able to agree that:
1) "craft," when isolated and privileged, leads to the kind of lazy reliance
on notions of aesthetic self-evidence that results in (at best) arbitrary
"wordsmithing" and (at worst) a bunch of people sitting around a table
saying "oh, I like that," "yeah, that works for me," and then all turning
their heads to see whether the Master likes it as well?
2) when "craft" is neglected and / or demonized, another kind of
arbitrariness creeps into the picture--the unreflective consent among
members of a "poetics"-based community to privilege things like "process,"
"proceduralism," etc., on a social / political / ideological level, and to
avoid formulating any vocabulary for qualitative evaluation of actual words,
phrases, sentences, and their combinations and recombinations?

Q: Does "poetics" as a system fall prey to another kind of self-evidence
trap when it assumes that an adherence to certain types of process-based
method, in combination with certain political positionings, etc.,
self-evidently establishes artistic legitimacy?

Suggestion: there are 4 modes (among others, of course) within which a
pedagogical situation of poetic critique, instruction, and production is
particularly liable to fall short in terms of reflectiveness:

1) Vulgar Workshoppery.  Workshop members assume the self-evident presence
of a qualitative standard, but offer no coherent articulation of same beyond
intuitive snap judgments, individual prejudices, etc., ultimately deferring
to group approval or the Master's blessing or both.  Results in work whose
qualitative assessment lacks any basis beyond arbitrary subjective approval
or disapproval.

2) Bourgeois Wordsmithery.  Workshop members have some degree of clarity
about standards for the production of work, which are generally articulated
in the form of prescriptive style guidelines adapted from analysis of
"successful" mainstream poetry, and which are often administered by a
more-or-less conscientious "expert."  Work produced in this environment
attains a relatively high level of "professionalism" within the aesthetic
pronounced by the expert(s), but frequently lacks evidence of a broader
self-reflective awareness of the function of the work in a larger social /
political sphere, especially as such a function might relate to process and
reception.

3) Commodified Alternativity.  Workshop members adopt stylistic and
procedural points of practice from avant-garde and experimental traditions,
with an implicit eye toward the displacement of the dominant model of
mainstream poesis and its replacement by this new improved model.  Actual
evaluation of praxis, however, often merely reproduces the "self-evidence"
paradigm of the standard bourgeois model.  What emerges is too often a
renovated stylistic surface rather than a newly reflective consideration of
the larger social function of a poetics in relation to publication,
professionalism, canonization, etc.  Think "ellipticist."

4) Party-Line Poetiks.  Participants (they would reject the term "workshop
members") adhere to a rigid model of procedural or counter-referential or
otherwise "experimental" praxis, which is posited as a necessary mode of
opposition to mainstream workshoppery of all kinds.  This opposition would
entail not only an attitude toward the production of the poetic object
itself, but its circulation within certain closely circumscribed conditions
of readership and publication, etc.  Work produced in such a climate resists
being inserted into standard evaluative paradigms, because the principles of
construction by which it is generated are so often "random" or
"chance-based" or "anti-lyrical" or otherwise prohibitive of reactions based
on what the Russian Formalists and Barrett Watten would call "subjective
aesthetic response."  Along with this resistance, however, comes the
potential for impasse: when subjective aesthetic response is scrupulously,
prophylactically militated against, the result is often work that has no
recognizeable function other than as meta-statement (or meta-expression, or
meta-signification, or whatever), and thus has no reason to exist other than
to perpetuate the mode of praxis which produces it.  Circularity ensues.
Not that there is necessarily anything wrong with this, except when it
creates an atmosphere within which one cannot even discuss the kinds of
activities associated with "craft" without being associated with a
retrograde uncritical mainstreamery, and (perhaps especially) when it
encourages a self-congratulatory "community" of writers who praise each
other's work automatically and unthinkingly, simply because it adheres to an
official canon of correctness.  When this happens, you basically have
exactly the same situation as in Vulgar Workshoppery, just with the emphasis
on process / communal alignment rather than on objects / authorial subjects.

All these modes are, of course, reductive exaggerations.   But I don't think
they're totally unrepresentative of some things that are going on out there
/ in here.

I think the missing element in all four nightmare scenarios is what Maria
calls "exuberance" and "spontaneity," and what someone yesterday (sorry, I'm
too lazy to check the archive and give proper credit) invoked when they said
that if work doesn't risk sentimentality it's shit.  Actually, you could
probably replace "sentimentality" with just about any other word and it
would be just as true.

The problem, however, is how to distinguish "spontaneity" etc. from the kind
of arbitrary subjective self-evidentiary wallowing that we've been talking
about.  What is the line between improvisation (ex nihilo or otherwise) and
directionlessness?  What are the respective roles of "craft" and "process"
in making such a determination?  And, again, can we rescue "craft" from the
ignominy it has suffered via its association with retrograde workshoppery?
Can "process" be rescued from its own self-legitimizing tendencies?

bravo, kasey!... great summary of emphases...

let's imagine, then, that the practices associated with the
production of craft-laden works are not only about craft as such...
that they point in many directions, as you suggest, up to and
including what is meant by "successful" reception, community, etc....

one question, then, for workshop devotees is whether they're teaching
only those who already "have what it takes" to be writers (a question
that, as i've learned to my dismay, can provoke a bloodbath even when
discussing something as bureacratically inert as curricula)... but if
you're teaching only those who already have what it takes, what are
you teaching?... answer:  craft...  and indeed, it's become almost de
rigueur to pronounce that craft can be taught, but art cannot... i
wish i had a dime for every time i've heard "but you can't teach
creative writing" from creative writing instructors, an extension of
the "poets are born, not made" adage, from which situation (?) the
word "craft" bubbleth forth, historically speaking... as one might
expect, this leaves many initiates with the distinct impression that
their muse is playing hide & seek with them...

some even argue that art does not require craft...

so how to rescue craft from its stranglehold on the (pedagogical)
intellect?... one thing for certain:  there can't be an easy
answer---we know this simply b/c the concept itself is buried under
decades of praxis... of course we can allow "but there's such a thing
as craft"---sure, why not?... we can even qualify this by admitting
that art, whatever it is, doesn't always seem to require it (as
above)... but the moment we open our mouths in public (this list
incl.) we're unearthing a shit pile of ancient credos and convictions
that constitute some folks' idea of an education, and what's more,
one that might prove utterly useless, b/c yknow, you can't teach
creative writing...

sorry to keep this so short, but i've split my fingernail open and
it's killing me...

best,

joe

of course i mean this in a positive sense - i am for saying one's mind

on the list finds compelling  reasons to criticised langpo or whatever po, go
ahead & present your arguements -  for me that's enough not to be "bashing".

A few thoughts, trying to sustain this thread, particularly in its current
and no doubt fragile state of attempted politesse--

Re. Jim's Addonizio poem: the lines

In these nightmares, the dead feel
the soft nub of the eraser
lightening their bones.

are either the best or the worst in the poem, right? The most Poetical, in
any case [I back em myself, except for  "lightening"]. But I'm
also thinking about their placement relatively early in the poem: what if the
poem ENDED here? Lots of folks, Altieri comes to mind, have talked about the
way the 'workshop poem' gradually heightens its plain speakin' into an imagist
epiphany at its climax--what's either "interesting" or "bad" about both
the Adonizio poems quoted on this list is their (intentional?) refusal to
follow this particular linguistic/emotional logic.

In any case (responding now to Kasey), Amy Lowell's (1916) "Patterns"
[ending of course with the classic outcry, an outcry that might stand high in
many camp compendia, 'Christ! What are patterns for?'] reads like a
textbook example of the "decay" of Imagism; that is, when you want to be
an Imagist while at the same time speaking about matters you feel
passionately about/demonstrating what a good person you are [here my
binary is meant to refer to Dodie's powerful defense of a certain feminist
poetics on the first hand & the basic critique of workshop poetics on the
other].

I just taught "Patterns" and used it as a way of disussing the
dead end of Imagism, gender & content, etc--it's very easy to read the
poem as a conscious auto-critique of (Poundian)
imagism, with its use of hard/soft binaries, etc--[of course this may all be
already out there in Lowell scholarship, about which I'm lamentably ignorant..]

Here's my final announcement about a reception I'll be part of in New York
City next week.  It's a reception at the Center for Book Arts (28 West
27th Street, 3rd Floor) from 6 to 8 pm to kick off an exhibit of works by
visual poets involved with the anthology Crag Hill and I edited, Writing To
Be Seen, that will last until 15 November (when there will be some kind of
closing performance at 7 pm).  The visual poets expected at the event
besides me are Kathy ernst, Scott Helmes, Joel Lipman, Bill Keith and
Marilyn Rosenberg.  It'd be fun to meet some of you New Yorkers I've been on
threads with, whether we agreed or disagreed.

Good grief, I thought I had the date of the reception.  It's Friday, 20
September.

Thanks for asking, Harriet.  I hope this isn't my third message of the day!

I enjoyed the satire of these 4 models. But, you know, they aren't
exhaustive . . . and each, I imagine, has a positive flip side. The
Dream Scenarios. Where ART is afoot, and craft is the footman. ART
is the movement, rushing into risk . . . craft is the limit of movement,
bringing one back. If all you allow is craft, there will be no movement.
(which a group, a "workshop" say, often can find it easy to endorse, as
they don't have to work very hard to see the edges of the work) If all
you allow is art, say the impulse to the risk of art, then you'll only
have the swirl. There will be movement, but little direction. It will
diffuse.

Workshops, because of their name, tend toward the limitations of
craft. If, instead, they were called Experimenta (or even if they were
called wefijwoif), something else would rise. Remember, a rose by any
other name would no longer be a rose.

Here's a poem by one of my favorite poets, Bin Ramke. It's from his
most recent book, _Airs, Waters, Places_. What I find amazing here is
how the voice, the thinking of the poem, continues toward its object
while continuing to be aware of itself unfolding, how it lets its music
be a part of its thought. It's a wonderful example, I believe, of a type
of poetry that embraces its lyrical, human terms, while moving away
from the autobiographical, narrative turns so common in poetry today.

Livery of Seisin


"the delivery of property into the corporal possession of a person: in the
case of a house, by giving him the ring, latch, or key of the door; in
the case of land, by delivering him a twig, a piece of turf, or the like" -- OED


Of touch, the annoyance
That if I touch you you
Touch me--the affront it is and

Its reciprocal nature and it is
The basis of the lighter
Perversions, frottage, for instance which is

The secret joy of public
Touching it is, on a bus
To transport to touch the whole self

There is no stopping
It, if (there is no defense)
I touch you you touch me

If I touch (if not you)
The glamour of the stars
Oh the stars (famously beyond reach)

That such light touches
The eyes the retina, parts of the skin
The inevitable body (where we live no matter)

And too
The warm the sun striking out
But the stars softly at night (impossibly by day)

That we touch the stars
And that any light-
Emitting body (heat, and any radiation)

Is infinite in size or will be,
Caressing the universe
At a hundred eighty-six thousand

Miles per second
O love o sacred. To change,
To hold the house in your hand, the subject,

To expand infinitely to the end
Too terrible to think upon
Each man's life is but a breath (Psalm 39) A touch

A touching most intimate,
The breath a column still attached
To the warm, wet lung, every leering man knows

What he's doing, dreary,
Perpendicular sounds flying past
Touch, extensive touch of someone's tongue,

Expensive.
O do talk less, give us
Room, give us air dry and drifting

Flowers inventing
Themselves on the tips
Of trees, reach out Nature reaches

Trees reach out like
Stars light their touch
And candor, all their own, their touch.

I don't have a lot to offer here, but it should be
clarified that The Conversions was published in I think
1961, more than a decade before Mathews joined Oulipo in
1973 (at the invitation of Georges Perec). HM says
somewhere that he knew nothing at all about Oulipo before
the early 70s, and so would not have been employing
specifically Oulipian techniques in The Conversions or The
Sinking of Odradek Stadium. (The Oulipo itself was only
just getting started when The Conversions came out.) But HM
did know the work of Raymond Roussel, to which Ashbery
introduced him, and claims that Roussel's novels and How I
Wrote Certain of My Books were the impetus that convinced
him he could write fiction. (Before this he'd focused on
poetry and, earlier still, music.) So at this point it's a
case of common influences. It was through The Conversions,
though, that Perec first encountered HM's work, and greeted
him enthusiastically as a sort of Oulipian avant la lettre.

I don't have references for the foregoing at hand, but can
post them if Laird or anybody else is interested. I myself
would be happy to hear whether there's a good sustained
analysis of the formal construction of the novel out there.
And more specifically, does anybody have a solution to the
novelist's winning speech in the contest with the gypsy
king? Beat my head against the wall trying to solve that
one!

Best,
Damian

Kinda off-topic, but I recommend listers check out Beck's latest cd,
streaming at beck.com.  If you sign up for a Beck e-mailing list (you could
always block it later) you can sample all of the songs from his latest, SEA
CHANGE, which will appeal even to folks who don't normally like his stuff.
Very twangy, maudlin, great deep voice.  Worth checking out.

since listing on the net has been a topic recently here and there are i
think people from all of the organiztions this concerns, I have a question
(actually, I'll cc poetics also): is there any effort to coordinate
listings?

I started looking at my listings at ELO and discovered that my "My Gut"
stamps were not found.  it turns out that apparently ranrun has been made a
part of trace?

Aldon, you've fallen into my Winterwear pile, and this Fall is either coming
in early or I'm anemic. The small press mags I wear between an undershirt
and one of my many lumberjack sweaters. I figure the next time they bust me,
I'll have something to read while waiting for the missus to bail me out. (I
do hope she doesnt use that line again about not having married me to do
this distasteful biz.)  Yrs, Unchained Felony.

so, can anyone tell us definitively if this is a hoax or not?  w/o
having visited the website i think it might be, cuz wouldn't homeland
security have a gov suffix rather than an org?  i'm a bit embarrassed
because i sent out the msg to many concerned friends, and don't want
to be an alarmist, much as i appreciate the actual need for alarm in
this time.

Once at Bromige's place I found myself trapped in his underwear
drawer, and while there I had the time to notice that some of the
items were things I found to be missing after one of Bromige's visits
to my place.

But one's main experience of being stuck in Bromige's underwear
drawer is a renewed appreciation for the first line of Philip
Lamantia's poem "Wilderness Sacred Wilderness":

        "It's cozy to be a poet in a bed, on a copse, knoll, in a room"

i've got a pixel missing on this machine, it's always on, it's always blue
- another's always white - double-star system - dear god - you look up -
you're always there in the stars - you know you're saving everyone - you
know there's reason for all this evil in the world - i'm your secret
friend - i can't get enough of you - you enter my very soul - they're
leaping now from tall buildings - they're burning in fires on the ground -
they're hanging from the trees - they're divided among others - they can't
think very well - dear god - you must save us - all the hurting people -
people fighting and starving - people killing and being killed - so many
sick and dying people - so many animals too and plants too - the screen
stares at me, punctured or fissured; the screen carries its own after-
effects, nimbus and aureole of light - you write on blue against black,
black against gray, yellow against blue - the colors of the troposphere -
sun glaring at all of us - it doesn't know any better - dear god, please
do hide the sun, it is so troublesome for so many of your lowly creatures,
it casts light where there is none, nothing remains of the light, shadows
am too bright, the glare too dark, in the corners many eyes see, many eyes
are blinded - may the sky welcome us - even just against my skin i can
hear them - the computer next to me breathing heavily - producing
animations of untoward, ungodly things - things that everyone desires -
there's a raging storm outside - lasting the batteries - until the frame -
until the last frame - is done, completed - the world going by at twelve
frames a second - you can't imagine - you can't see - you wouldn't believe
- dear god, complementary colors burning into me, i can't speak to you any
more like this, my head is reeling, you must ascend to us - oh, nothing?,
what could possibly be meant - the passage - eternal writing - the
murmuring growing louder - the sounds, furious - Karl loved Gertrud - he
wove his phenomenology around her - she was his star - the indescribable
Cipher of engagement for the two of them - writing them into the ground -
at the limits - dear god, please help Karl and Gertrud - is it always too
late - is sanction the very last thing before the eyes close - we are, we
are losing, worlds - too many wounded - the battle can't go on much longer
- both machines running fans at full-tilt - it isn't enough - the
animation slowing - almost to a halt - i'd settle for grays - zig-zags
across the eyes - dear god, do please listen, i will not thank you, i will
never thank you, you have never done enough, you have never even started -
all the animals burned and buried - the fury of humans, their slaughter -

unsleeping - the screen almost illegible - double-time fans - furious
productions - something freezes, crashes, topples, all those poor people
leaping from the building -

Meadows (2nd ed)  by Lawrence Upton, ISBN 1 84254 070 1; B6; 24pp. There
were problems with the first edition (Sep 2000), with punctuation and

Thanks for your thought-provoking post and your kind words about my work.
Since I am very short on time right now I won't be able to respond to all
your questions or comments, but I am very much looking forward to doing so
at a later time. But I do want to say something about anxiety and the list
and some related issues. Without going into too much detail about specific
people and why they were excluded from the list  (as I remember it I wasn't
participating or very active on it for much of the time when all this was
going on) I can say how I felt and feel about the issue of exclusion. As
much as I passionately believe in and support freedom of speech, I really
don't like bullies. As I understand it, this list is made available through
resources at SUNY Buffalo through the work of Charles Bernstein. For a time
a number of people took advantage of the open policy of this list to
personally attack Charles and the so-called Language Poets.
I view this as a kind of testing and a call for limits. The limits were then
applied, taking the form of excluding certain bullying people from the list.
My experience is that bullies never admit that they are bullies. They
usually resort to justifying their behavior according to some sort of
politics or philosophical or theological system or whatever. There comes a
time when the victims of such bullying have had enough and will have to
respond with decisive firmness. Now on to the issue of anxiety. When
bullies-who are often incredibly anxious people themselves- repeatedly push
other people around this leads to anxiety and other kinds of suffering for
the recipients of the bullying and for the witnesses of the bullying. The
recipients and the witnesses now have a choice. If they don't wish to be
passive like sheep they will stand up to the bullies, say they have had
enough and stop them. Now, this process goes for the world outside this list
as well as this list. Anxiety has many effects, and people will do a lot of
things to avoid anxiety and to end anxiety. These things are inconsistent
and not the same for everybody. One way to deal with anxiety-which also
ordinarily involves much ambivalence- is to come up with a one-size-fits-all
answer to all questions or conflicts. Some people use politics this way,
theology this way, philosophy this way, aesthetics this way, psychology this
way. It works like this. Experience anxiety and conflict, plug in the
political answer. For some people (and I know many such people, as does
everyone) being tough and strong and fair means being rigidly consistent
about their philosophy or politics or whatever in the face of any conflict
or disagreement. The result is radically reducing their own anxiety, usually
at the cost of radically raising a lot of other people's anxiety. Many such
people are unbelievably obsessive-compulsive providing the illusion they are
courageously consistent in the face of all opposition. But these people-who
can be geniuses, including criminal geniuses- are not being mainly guided by
their so-called philosophies or politics but by their desire to push other
people around. I personally have had it with such people whether they are on
this list or anywhere in the world. The big question is, how do you identify
if someone is such a person. In real life, and this is real life, this
happens when enough people have had enough of such a person. Now, sometimes
it does happen that two such people have had enough of each other. This
might be the most dangerous situation of all. Maybe we have such a situation
with George Bush versus Saddam Hussein, maybe not. Which one is more of a
bully? Do the rest of us have to make sure the fight does not kill us all?
Maybe it is the same thing with this list. Can we trust that the people (in
the world, on the list) will have a fair fight? Personally, I don't think
so. I think the world has to curb Saddam Hussein's fascist, sadistic
tendencies, but the world has to watch out for the the same tendencies in
Mr. Bush and the governments of the United States and other rightward
leaning, militaristic countries. Assertion can be very effective, and my
feeling right now is that the world is teetering dangerously on the edge of
a nuclear disaster. But even this cannot be an excuse for letting bullies
run the show. Yes, given the  right situation, anybody, and any group, can
terrorize. But my own feeling is that you can bully some of the people some
of the time, but you can't bully all of the people all of the time, on the
list, or anywhere else.

Nick. You're such a thoughtfull person! Monsieur Brink got very angry but
you stay calm and explain things: that's what I like about your posts and
the one's to Qureshi and also around the time of S11.  I, like you, was not
on the list at the time of the "harrangues" alleged to have taken place and
also there has been the big controversy re Langpo etc and "selling out"...I
agree with you re bullying: I would urge you to read "The New Rulers of the
World" by John Pilger...sure he's almost "evangelistic" but you would see
that the major bullies are the US, Israel,Britain etc I dont think it can
only be a personal thing (although the Bush family know the Bin Ladens and
it could be) Hitler was a bully who was let to go and both Bush and Saddam
Hussein have to be watched: but then you have to concur with increased
destruction of Iraq and more deaths will happen if Bush goes ahead with his
attack on Iraq  - the destruction done (or even what he could conceivably
do) by Hussein is far less than that perpetrated on Dresden, Hamburg,
Hiroshima, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and and so on. I cant agree to an
attack on Iraq unless it is seen that the whole world have an equal imput
into the UN and also all the people of the United States (its wrong that a
President can act without approval)....but if I go on I'll start bullying
and that is no way to settle differences.

Re the List and anxiety I agree: or at least I agree that some people have a
lot of anxiety about things (so much) that they become authoritarian: so we
see that in various proportions everywhere: in all organisations, workplaces
and there are the obvious examples in politics: of course there is no "one
way"...we humans are to complex for that.

If they were atacking Charles Bernstein etal without good arguments then we
are all left baffled: my point being I couldnt find the attacks (except I
remember one which was a bit unfair about a reading): rather than get angry
it is better to work on those things we think need improving.

I see the world as like a Huge List (i dont separate poetry politics any
discipline thhey all interact for me) but the Iraqis for example seem to be
more open to discussion and negotiation than the US Government. The Israelis
and the US I see as unbending and dangerous (especially as the Israelis are
fond of "pre-emptive strikes"  and their leader authorised massacres,[ AND
they have nukes] - his record is worse than Saddam Hussein's - who I see as
just a rather authoritarian (fairly secular ) leader - who for a long time
was backed by the US. but relatively benign.

I repeat though: the people most anxious, those who will suffer the most are
the common people in Iraq who had nothhing to do with anything. We can
assuage anxiety by acting against tryranny and half-crazed dynasties such as
the Bush Admin. (Amd any other dictatorships)

Attacks or disagreements dont or shouldnt I feel imply an attack on the
individual addressed.  Re Langpo I love it but I also see the value of a lot
of "mainstream"  (its not always so clear where the divisions are). Alan
Loney Of Auckland who casts himself as an outsider and a (language poet? not
sure certainly very influenced by Olson at least) is most power full where
he is (more or less "mainstream" (Scott hamilton if he gets back on (off for
technical reasons!) on can talk about his (Aan's) latest book about  a train
disastor which involves some personal issues and of course is "language
orientated" as well))...and in your book (the latest one I think) I like
some of the clarity (I also like complexity and "magic" and so on) but you
also draw attention to the fact that this book, (your's) is a text, etc and
without doing a complex analysis, some of these things are "lyrical" (as
Qureshi picked up):

For those who feel depression or anxiety (and i have suffered from it in the
past) I recommend Dr Wayne Dyer's books (deceptively "simplistic") in fact
he talks about authoritarianism in his book "The Sky's the Limit (I agree
some of the titles of these books are a bit of a worry!) in much the same
terms you have outlined. But I used especially his book "Your Erroneous
Zones" when my mother was very ill and I was stuck at home and anxious about
cash etc to pull myself from depression and anxiety by acting on it. By
thinking as positively as possible:by being open: by thinking of myself and
others. That's where I think revolutions go wrong: they negelct subtle
psychological and cultural questions...although I think that both Lenin and
Mao Tse Tung were groping toward these things (but I dont embrace any
partcicular ideology, I dont like political parties, any of them)...and/but
we now have to deal with the now.  And we need to show tolerance and
compassion and the kind of kindness and consideration and real
thoughtfulness that you exhibit.  Richard Taylor.

Beth Anderson and Ange Mlinko

Friday, October 11
6:30 p.m. potluck, 8 p.m. readings
900 Bancroft Way

Beth and Ange will read from their work and address issues surrounding
travel writing and vertigo.

Beth Anderson is the author of The Habitable World (Instance Press, 2001)
and four chapbooks, including The Impending Collision and Hazard. Her poems
have appeared or are forthcoming in The Germ, Barrow Street, Hanging Loose,
and other journals and in An Anthology of New (American) Poets (Talisman
House, 1998). The Habitable World was a finalist manuscript for the National
Poetry Series and the Walt Whitman Award.  Anderson is also an editor of
Subpress, a cooperative small press publisher of poetry.

Ange Mlinko's first book of poems was Matinees (Zoland Books, 1999)
and her second one is in progress. She was born in Philadelphia and
has lived and engaged in alternative poetry scenes in Boston,
Providence, and New York City. In 1999 she lived and taught a poetry
workshop in the Kingdom of Morocco. She edited The Poetry Project
Newsletter from 2000-2002.

21st-Century Poetics thanks the Townsend Center and the Department of
English for their support.  But participants are asked to help buttress our
indie-ness by bringing food or drink; we would also be grateful for help
with setup or cleanup from those who are able.

One danger of skin will be that it harden to ceramics.
Then
glaze, like all erotica, will seem terminal. Lakey
Teasdale
spinning one on the wheel, which will be electric;
eyes the same
color as morning drenching everything, even my balls
as I wake
up, swallow three caps of gingko saint john's, swallow
coffee and
a cigarette as if I had religion foaming at the mouth
between us.
With Mez watching my genes re-code, I wanted water to
cling to
the railing again like stalagtite mirrors, inverting
seeing gray
in the sky means it's aged just this much.
     I sat down forcefully, examining the prose as if
it too were
a fungus beneath my nails. On days like that I would
thank God
for the vegetative life, but God never says you're
welcome; she
just snores on and on; and I rise against her dreams,
the whole
house drowned to the rictus of a pinprick; I just mow
through the
dark with arms in search of coffee.
     Indeed, Lawrence Upton vocalizes. Seismic
pentameter, she
moans, the syringe halfway through her spine, singing
like night
skidding to closure on the runway drenched with
morning colors,
an artificiality of typoo that disenthralls gauge set
to weigh in
at whatever breath thickens on the windows; winter,
like John M.
Bennett's spacious bathroom, has spurs all up and down
the
eyelets of the shower curtain. This serves to protect
the
subjunctive from caverns spanning days of sitting and
reading the
Koran, searching for fresh-mown coffee in the dark of
blood-words
on Old Testament rice-paper, good for rolling through
with all
the drunkenness of now fully up, not dressed but
seeking August
Highland; Alan Sondheim mimics Alan Sondheim, I tell
Nikuko, who
Julu-foams between us like spirituality without
doctrine. I
staggered all through the lightning house trying on
each beauty I
 crossed.

All I remember is the fragment, the box springs of the
head. The
weather was broken and lying in several sequences of
looped man-
action (javelin throw, drunken vomiting, coitus) on my
desk. I
picked up the pieces and moved on. You must have
bought new
furniture while I slept. You must have summed up the
crisis in
the Middle East. The neighbors like balloons slide
quietly across
 the parking lot; it's early yet, you must have
damaged the room
beyond repair as I slept. Calling tech support, the
beautiful
elderly hunched over the slowness of their day pinch
out of my
scowl a smile that unravels like threads on a list of
things to
do dirtier next time around. I think: will this be us?
And would
be pleased were it so: an old couple holding hands
across
airplane debris that bite deeply into the ground,
finding
everywhere and allowing to gush the watertable on
which I've re-
assembled the weather, creative and tortured little
prick that I
am, unable to leave well enough alone. All I remember
is the
fragrance, the glancing of teeth on moaning flesh, and
dusks
squiting laterally from your eyes as you sat on me.
You must have
corrected the vacancy in my annual report. I
exaggerated the
profit, but still feel good about the crisis in the
Middle East.

I thought of you, Bob, last night while I was driving to Blockbuster and
the following Neil Diamond song came on the radio.  (I often listen to
"great soft hits--where the classics never go out of style.")


"Can You Feel The Love Tonight"

There's a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling world
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

Can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
Can you feel the love tonight?


[Elton John/ Tim Rice]

Subject:      Fwd: White Box ... Prank?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Hi All,

Below is another post from the person who sent me the original White
Box closing announcement (from Germany, we are so global these days).
A couple of people wrote me back channel to say it was a hoax, and
Kevin and I had pretty much figured that out anyway, we felt very
sleuth-like doing so.

But, I think this is a a wonderful piece of public art.  Reminds me
of Orson Wells and the Martians.  As screwy as things are going, the
White Box story seems only too imaginable.

At a friend's suggestion, I spent some time last week looking up
right-wing conspiracy websites that believe, seriously, that George
Bush is the anti-Christ.  Beyond all the convoluted ways they get 666
out of his name, they were frightening in how they weren't that off
in terms of picking up the apocalyptic tone of the times.  The sites
comparing him to Hitler were even more disturbing, in that there
wasn't any numerology or Biblical interpretations, just comparisons
with another era when things catapulted beyond reason.

Sorry if I disturbed anybody needlessly.

Best,
Dodie

  As per your explicit instructions,
  howsoever unintelligible, but nice,

  hebrew, latin, pig latin, yiddish
  russian, german and french I
  coated every orifice with rhetoric

  I was finding it hard to breathe, to seethe

  Your voice melding with empty moans as you

  ask why the office is not yet painted?
  stumble motion forward head down

  feeling as i was rising from the dead
  was it really worth staying on till
  last call? music now dies from my memory
  but lives in punctilious creases from
  instep to hand tailored fits like a dream
  a thin steam of mesmerism blends
  with the unopened paint cans
  bundled in the bathroom. Who
  knows what color I'm thinking in,
  right now, other than you?

Please join us at Bridge Street Books 7 PM Sunday Sept 22nd
for a reading and publication celebration.

ANSELM BERRIGAN
&
JEAN DONNELLY

New Yorker Anselm Berrigan's terrific new Edge Book is called ZERO STAR
HOTEL. He is also the author of INTEGRITY & DRAMATIC LIFE and THEY BEAT ME
OVER THE HEAD WITH A SACK. Cool, humorous, honest, and surprising, Berrigan's
work will enliven and challenge you-- this man can the push the poetic
buttons all day long. Anselm's work has appeared in numerous magazines and
journals including The Best American Poetry 2002 edited by Robert Creeley.

Kevin Killian on ZERO STAR HOTEL: "It's a wonderful book and a big, huge
quantum leap
for Anselm Berrigan, whose previous work I have also enjoyed, but this book
is really something different, it gives you the passionate can't-put-it-down
experience of reading a great novel, and technically it's so assured you
don't even notice how he, Anselm, is
producing all his effects.

DC's own Jean Donnelly received the National Poetry Series Award for ANTHEM,
selected by Charles Bernstein and published by Sun & Moon. She is also the
author of the Edge book THE JULIA SET. A poet all the way down to her toes,
Donnelly's lyric sensitivity and powerful knack for the what-it-is will
rewrite your heart and mind. Donnelly received her MFA from George Mason and
has taught poetry at Georgetown University. She was a founding of the
jounrnal So to Speak. Her work has appeared in numerous journals including
The Germ, Big Allis, Kenning, Lingo, and Crow.

Charles Bernstein on ANTHEM: "Anthem is fresh as the first moment of the rest
of your life, where invention is an attribute of grace and the intimacy of
the newly coined rules the roost. O say can you see the charms bursting in
ear."

The following is making the rounds these days -- perhaps it
was posted here already but if so I missed it. Anyhow, it
seems to me that, just as in the HUAC, Vietnam, and nuclear

solidarity and resistance. Here's one rhetorically powerful
example.

STATEMENT OF CONSCIENCE
NOT IN OUR NAME


Let it not be said that people in the United States did
nothing when their government declared a war without limit
and instituted stark new measures of repression.


The signers of this statement call on the people of the
U.S. to resist the policies and overall political direction
that have emerged since September 11, 2001, and which pose
grave dangers to the people of the world.


We believe that peoples and nations have the right to
determine their own destiny, free from military coercion by
great powers. We believe that all persons detained or
prosecuted by the United States government should have the
same rights of due process. We believe that questioning,
criticism, and dissent must be valued and protected. We
understand that such rights and values are always contested
and must be fought for.


We believe that people of conscience must take
responsibility for what their own governments do  --  we
must first of all oppose the injustice that is done in our
own name. Thus we call on all Americans to RESIST the war
and repression that has been loosed on the world by the
Bush administration.  It is unjust, immoral, and
illegitimate. We choose to make common cause with the
people of the world.


We too watched with shock the horrific events of September
11, 2001. We too mourned the thousands of innocent dead and
shook our heads at the terrible scenes of carnage  --  even
as we recalled similar scenes in Baghdad, Panama City, and,
a generation ago, Vietnam. We too joined the anguished
questioning of millions of Americans who asked why such a
thing could happen.


But the mourning had barely begun, when the highest leaders
of the land unleashed a spirit of revenge. They put out a
simplistic script of "good vs. evil" that was taken up by a
pliant and intimidated media. They told us that asking why
these terrible events had happened verged on treason. There
was to be no debate. There were by definition no valid
political or moral questions. The only possible answer was
to be war abroad and repression at home.


In our name, the Bush administration, with near unanimity
from Congress, not only attacked Afghanistan but arrogated
to itself and its allies the right to rain down military
force anywhere and anytime. The brutal repercussions have
been felt from the Philippines to Palestine, where Israeli
tanks and bulldozers have left a terrible trail of death
and destruction. The government now openly prepares to wage
all-out war on Iraq -- a country which has no connection to
the horror of September 11.  What kind of world will this
become if the U.S. government has a blank check to drop
commandos, assassins, and bombs wherever it wants?


In our name, within the U.S., the government has created
two classes of people: those to whom the basic rights of
the U.S. legal system are at least promised and those who
now seem to have no rights at all. The government rounded
up over 1,000 immigrants and detained them in secret and
indefinitely. Hundreds have been deported and hundreds of
others still languish today in prison. This smacks of the
infamous concentration camps for Japanese-Americans in
World War 2. For the first time in decades, immigration
procedures single out certain nationalities for unequal
treatment.


In our name, the government has brought down a pall of
repression over society. The President's spokesperson warns
people to "watch what they say."  Dissident artists,
intellectuals, and professors find their views distorted,
attacked, and suppressed. The so-called Patriot Act --
along with a host of similar measures on the state level --
gives police sweeping new powers of search and seizure,
supervised if at all by secret proceedings before secret
courts.


In our name, the executive has steadily usurped the roles
and functions of the other branches of government. Military
tribunals with lax rules of evidence and no right to appeal
to the regular courts are put in place by executive order.
Groups are declared "terrorist" at the stroke of a
presidential pen.


We must take the highest officers of the land seriously
when they talk of a war that will last a generation and
when they speak of a new domestic order.  We are
confronting a new openly imperial policy towards the world
and a domestic policy that manufactures and manipulates
fear to curtail rights.


There is a deadly trajectory to the events of the past
months that must be seen for what it is and resisted. Too
many times in history people have waited until it was too
late to resist.


President Bush has declared: "you're either with us or
against us." Here is our answer: We refuse to allow you to
speak for all the American people.  We will not give up our
right to question. We will not hand over our consciences in
return for a hollow promise of safety. We say NOT IN OUR
NAME. We refuse to be party to these wars and repudiate any
inference that they are being waged in our name or for our
welfare. We extend a hand to those around the world
suffering from these policies; we will show our solidarity
in word and deed.


We who sign this statement call on all Americans to join
together to rise to this challenge. We applaud and support
the questioning and protest now going on, even as we
recognize the need for much, much more to actually stop
this juggernaut. We draw inspiration from the Israeli
reservists who, at great personal risk, declare "there is a
limit" and refuse to serve in the occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza.


We also draw on the many examples of resistance and
conscience from the past of the United States: from those
who fought slavery with rebellions and the underground
railroad, to those who defied the Vietnam war by refusing
orders, resisting the draft, and standing in solidarity
with resisters.


Let us not allow the watching world today to despair of our
silence and our failure to act. Instead, let the world hear
our pledge:  We will resist the machinery of war and
repression and rally others to do everything possible to
stop it.

  There's a Professor's job being advertised in my Department. I'm not the
only one interested in poetry here; there's also Michele Leggott and Murray
Edmond. We are all writer/academics. We have 2 novelists as well: Albert
Wendt and Witi Ihimaera.
 Twentieth Century poetry and American literature are both listed in the
adverts (appointments@auckland.ac.nz   and www.nzjobs.co.nz/auckland.ac) are
fields of special interest to the Department.  Unusually there is a positive
interest in youngish candidates--because none of us are getting any younger
(I exclude myself). Closing date looms. If anyone wants to know more
than this, please back-channel.

The website for the First Festival of Literary Magazines is online.

From the website:

"Throughout the 20th Century, the connection between French and American
poets has resulted in an exchange of forms, manifestoes, philosophies and
translations that has contributed, both historically and socially, to the
furtherance of contemporary poetics in both countries. This conference will
present this history as a living exchange, manifest through the presentation
of literary magazines. At this conference, both French and American
writer-editors will come together and discuss issues of community,
translation, practices of reading, tradition, funding, cross-cultural and
cross-genre influences on their publication practices.
"Rather than showcase a few select journals, the conference's focus will be
on conversation and the writer-editors invited will be those who are
particularly interested in establishing this connection as a living
correspondence. Rather than simply focusing on poetry, those invited will be
able to discuss this exchange within a larger context of contemporaryart,
politics and culture. In this way, the conference should be of interest to
anyone interested in how small magazines work to foster community.

"A companion exhibition entitled Charting the Here of There: A History of
French & American Poetry in Translation, curated by Béatrice Mousli and Guy
Bennett, will be on view at The New York Public Library, Humanities and
Social Sciences Library. A catalog of the exhibition will be published by
Granary Books, in conjunction with The New York Public Library."

Just went back over the list and noticed responses to the Brown-shirts
posting.  First, I want to say, Glass is also a Jewish name. Though I'm not
a practicing Jew, I do indeed maintain a deep connection with my heritage.
My mentioning of hitler (and I won't dignify the name with a capital) was
not meant to demean Alan, or denigrate anyone on this list.  The target from
the beginning was Alan's method of posting (over-posting) his creative work,
the assumption of the right to do this without asking anyone's permission,
etc. and etc.  If this is chutzpah, so be it.  I simply find it annoying and
puzzling why Alan cannot post links to his work instead of giving the list
his "gifts" over and over.  In that way I could exercise choice in the
matter of whether or not I wanted to read his "creative" work.  Of course I
could filter out Alan, but then again I'd be missing what he has to say, and
I find what he says sometimes to be of interest.  (And I've said these
things before.)  My apologies to everyone--including Alan, and of course
Maria.  The hitler business came in when the negative claque became a bit
too negative and I recalled the warnings I'd gotten earlier about speaking
up re: Alan and his yen for posting everything he writes.

All this was not so much a protest about Alan, as about trends in
computer-generated art in general.  If it's possible to create "work" in a
matter of minutes and post it, then what becomes of the idea of craft in
poetry?  The Disney could do it better business is another aspect I still
want to explore on this list: the economics of computer-generated art and
literature really bothers me.  Here's where people with access to bigger and
better machines get the added bonus of being able to wield more and more
power to promote themselves and their work.   This goes along quite nicely
with the future as some social scientists wish to portray it: an elite of
technocrats lording it over the financially (and perhaps educationally)
less-endowed. In a sense, Alan's non-stop computer-generated factory of
poems is redolent--in my opinion-- of that sort of thing.

Of course, Alan will not listen, or stop--and really, I never wanted him to
stop posting.  Just wanted him to post his "best" and/or--post links.

Don't know anything else to say except that I found most of the really
negative postings interesting simply because those folks don't know who I
am. No, I didn't vote for Bush.  The last time I whined about anything was
when I was two years old.  And I do find computer art of interest. I also
believe in complete freedom from censorship, but I do live in a land where
people take other people's feelings and personal space (as I feel my
computer is) into consideration. In short I was never interested in flaming
or offending, just speaking up.

My humor doesn't translate well via e-mail.  For that I'm sorry too.  Peace
and apologies, Jesse

| I simply find it annoying and

I didn't know you felt that way, Jesse, you should have said; we're all
terribly interested you know

The same applies to poetry written by hand

It remains to be demonstrated in any particular case that a piece of writing
has been generated in a couple of minutes

It remains to be demonstrated that writing effected in a couple of minutes
is less crafted than something which took a lot of time, that's only one
kind of craft

There is craft in improvisation, for instance

It remains to be demonstrated that it is invalid to post a quick or first
draft as intrinsically interesting

Separately... there was a German guy whose name I cannot remember but I can
retrieve it, 20-30 years ago, and probably many others since but I remember
him, who argued that the advent of machines indicated a need to reevaluate
our aesthetics to include those without craft skill enabled to produce
crafted work

Separately, aside from the above, that A is a poor craftsperson does not
lessen the craftspersonship of B

bigger and
| better machines get the added bonus of being able to wield more and more
| power to promote themselves and their work.

I'm more concerned about the power of those who own the software and
hardware infrastructure to control everything should they want

| In a sense, Alan's non-stop computer-generated factory of
| poems is redolent--in my opinion-- of that sort of thing.

I think that's an easy target and maybe that's significant. It's certainly
irrelevant.

You don't know me, yousay. You don't know Alan. His drive seems to me
anti-elitist

 Worry about those who own the net, not those who use it

| Of course, Alan will not listen, or stop--and really, I never wanted him
to
| stop posting.  Just wanted him to post his "best" and/or--post links.

Purity of the er... craft?

Jesse. Dont worry about it: Hitler wiped out the Brown Shirts: that was in
my favourite moive "The Night of the Long Knives".. a lot of them were of a
dubious persuasion shall we say! Most of the Nazis joined the US Secret
Servce or went into the French Foreign Legion and Werner Von Braun got a
cushy job designing Spaceships...Dont apologise so much.

But you could be right re computer generated art: there is an aspect of
"elitism" attached to it. However I think that most of the practioners - and
I'm thinking of Jim Andrew's site as an example - elitist some of them may
be, but they are doing some fascinating stuff: as you warn it can be
misused. Allan I think is simply driven: I cant handle the immense volume of
it...my own feeling is: good on him, but I simply have no idea what he is
going on about: one day I may have time to study it all: but else I like
Alan as much as I have had dealings with him.
   I just mark them, look at some: and study the odd one. It would be
impossible to convince Alan to stop (now once he actually put it to the List
whether he carry on and most were in favour): I feel he is seriously
obsessed with what he is doing: I have no problem with that: except that I
could never become so passionate about "things language" or  "things
computer" (fascinating as they maybe or French philosophy  and all the long
words Alan uses) for the opposite reason to you...I'm not interested in
poetry being "crafted" etc I believe in a kind of writing that is quite
often "sloppy": I reject the idea of the "perfect poem" and so on.
Sometimes I'm a helluva positive re Allen: other days it depresses me: I
think...no, no more! No more long poems....in fact, I sometimes think there
is just too much poetry and writing in the world: but someone is going to
now ask me what is too much: I think it depends on my mood at the time. Or
my energy,or chocolate,  or caffeine levels....

I'd have a glass of whiskey or a beer or maybe light up a joint is best
before you get on the list: or caffeinate...but dont worry about Hitler: I
assure you he is dead, his moestache was too much for him: and he hurt his
neck peering out of bunkers.....

....and  unless everyone puts pressure on the List bosses or they decide to
stop or limit A S's "flow" then its like pissing  in the sea to even mention
the issue. However, I can understand your feelings.  Richard Taylor.

Just a couple of things. Most of the writing I do is either on an old 133
Mhz Pentium I that I found for $10 (with linux on it). It takes hours and
hours to write the programs and hours to write the pieces, for better or
worse.

If I'm doing 3d animation/video, then I do need, and use, big machines;
every artist does. But what's sent to the list literally can be done on a
286 from 1987 with a dialup modem (and in fact I've done this as well).

Alan, can you talk a little bit about the process of
your writing...these programs themselves, and how the
pieces come through them? I'm interested because, as I
said earlier, I really have no concept of how you are
creating these pieces...am I wrong in thinking it's
analogous somehow to Cage's creating his pieces
randomly out of systems he previously designed with
some intention...? or like the canadian artist Rober
Racine...?

how *would* your work behave with visual component?
(not necessarily electronic or computer-related) i'm
remembering the "Poetry Plastique" show a couple of
years ago that had fabulous hybrids and dramatic
collaborations between written and visual...

just thoughts.

Now this is intriguing. Isn't it the case generally that
artists are more willing to mine the potential of
"obsolete" technologies than anyone else -- so that Alan,
your use of a 1987 machine would roughly correspond,
allowing for the accelerated history of computer as medium,
to book artists' use of letterpress printing in recent
decades. Though anyone with coding experience knows the
benightedness of, for example, HTML -- its avoidance of the
content model, compatibility problems, oversimplicity --
it's probably true that as a poetic medium HTML is far from
exhausted. Same goes for UNIX and for old processors. This
is in part a rebuke of Jesse's position. Artists who employ
computers can in fact gesture toward a slowing down or even
a reversal of the goosestep march toward bigger and better
machines. And this speaks to the question of craft --
whether a particular piece takes minutes or hours to
compose is beside the point: it's the process of feeling
around in the medium that matters, trying new combinations,
discovering and refining, not throwing out baby w/
bathwater when the next model goes on sale. It's heartening
to think of, because we're certainly encouraged by Gates et
alia to always be breathlessly anticipating the cutting
edge, and to think that technology's past is less
interesting than yesterday's news.

New Experiments:
Emerging Patterns in Innovative Literature by Authors Born in the 1960s and
1970s, Elucidated by Themselves
New Experiments, which will continue next spring and beyond, aims to map new
ways of reading, and to put a new generation on those maps.
Join us for three Saturdays this fall, as we inaugurate this special series,
curated by Elizabeth Treadwell Jackson.
In a recent letter to the Poetry Project Newsletter , Boston poet and editor
Jim Behrle made a call to innovative writers of the Baby Boomer (and older)
generation to "give the kids a chance". Small Press Traffic?s New Experiments
series will do just that. New Experiments will explore critical (though not
necessarily academic) ways of understanding writing that is being created now
by younger experimental poets and prose writers. These critical understandings
will be generated by the practitioners themselves in concert with the
presentation of new works by themselves and others.
These writers could be referred to as heirs of Language poetry, New Narrative,
New York School, and other fairly recently established categories, but our
idea is to seek out understandings of how far and wide -- and oddly, randomly,
anarchically through bumpy history -- their inheritances truly go and work. We
are also interested in exploring the contexts in which this writing is made
today, and the contemporary forces that shape it. Small Press Traffic is
interested in maintaining our position as an important venue for the latest in
writing by helping a diverse group of talented and committed poets and writers
under the age of forty-five -- most under thirty-five -- to create new works
and to discuss emerging patterns in the literature of their generation.
We are interested in how political and societal concerns and pop- and other
cultural influences function in the writing of this new generation, the what
and why of their aesthetics, and patterns in same that seem to each of the
invited writers to be appearing. New Experiments is devoted to finding out how
a diverse group of active writers and cultural workers see things; not in
creating new "schools" per se, but in creating new ways of reading and
understanding experimental writing that is happening today.

New Experiments: Marcella Durand on Ecological Poetry
Talk and discussion begins at 3:30, reading at 5:00

Marcella Durand writes: "Ecological poetry is much like ecological living?it
recycles materials, functions with an intense awareness of space, seeks an
equality of value between all living and unliving things, explores multiple
perspectives as an attempt to subvert the dominant paradigms of
mono-perception, consumption and hierarchy, and utilizes powers of
concentration to increase lucidity and attain a more transparent, less
anthropocentric mode of existence." Join us as she speaks about these issues
in terms of younger contemporary writers including Lisa Jarnot, Eleni
Sikelianos, Lisa Robertson and Lytle Shaw.

Durand is the author of Western Capital Rhapsodies (Faux Press, 2001) and two
chapbooks, City of Ports and Lapsus Linguae (Situations Press). A new
chapbook, The Geometrics, is forthcoming this year from BeautifulSwimmer
Press. She is the poetry editor of (the invisible city), an anthology of art
and poetry inspired by Italo Calvino?s Invisible Cities.

Just for the record. There are many great writers who were born in the 50's,
who were buried under the shadow of the Beat writers, New York School
Writers, and writers of the San Francisco Renaissance. While I applaud any
reason for a gathering of poets and celebration of any age group of writers,
I think it is a mistake to make this assumption that the poetry stage has
been dominated by Baby Boomer(and older). Again, kids, dogs, cats and snakes
should be celebrated for their work, but maybe, there also needs to also be
an investigation into those writers in the shadows who never really got a
great chance to be celebrated as lights of creativity.  And if you didn't
enter the academy there was no forum at all. Any thoughts on who those poets
might be?

I hope I won't hurt your feelings, Aaron, but I also think a poem that
doesn't do anything BUT risk sentimentality is crap, too.

THE SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC BOOK AWARDS

This year, the Small Press Traffic board of directors begins a new
tradition with the SPT Book Awards. Compiled from a list of board
members? favorite books of 2001 plus a lifetime achievement category,
the award recipients recall to us the best possibilities of energy,
engagement, intelligence and imagination in the writing that SPT works
to cultivate and promote. This year?s honorees are presented below in
alphabetical order, followed by the lifetime achievement winner.

Dodie Bellamy?s Cunt-Ups (Tender Buttons) works at what is often an
impasse in writing about sex, pushing the usual confessional scene
beyond the institutional and rhetorical horizons that often ensure its
triumph over the matter confessed. Organs, surfaces and fluids act in
this book in such profusion and with such rapid syntactic enjambment
that no decision can assign their parts to stable subjects for very
long. Relocating this "moment of decision" to the interior of each
sentence and body, Bellamy shifts the ethical demand of confession from
the "penitent"/narrator to the "confessor"/auditor, ensuring that the
reader plays along and that judgments regarding sex and writing are
formed in the act, not in an exempt outside.

Along very different lines, this refusal of exemption characterizes
Judith Goldman?s Vocoder (Roof), a rambunctious book of some terrifying
wrath and fury. Words just don?t do what they should, neither will human
beings. Poetry can?t disguise any longer the need for an adequate
politics, a need as basic as the need for air and water. There?s so much
to admire in Vocoder -- the attention Goldman pays to codes of all sorts,
the 19th century refusal to sit back and take it, the "no in thunder"
voice we have missed since the original American Renaissance. We put this
high on our list of this year?s best books for its originality, daring,
passion and relentless call to justice. (Goldman will read at SPT with Chelsey

The flipside of such commitment is that tried and true postmodern
poetics which finds a world of fragments ready to hand for inclusion in
form as an administrative schema, or one-dimensionally volatized into a
metaphorics of flux. Faced with such options, Dorothy Trujillo Lusk?s
Ogress Oblige (Krupskaya) would prefer not to, defiantly occupying the
hidden abode of the fragmentís production. Here archaic dictions plead
for an authorizing literary context under bombardment from a
contemporary vernacular of blunt refusal and blank disgust, while the
bigger bombs of geopolitics fall as a catch in our small-time bohemian
drifts. Lusk?s method stutters us back to the sites of interpellation,
refusing to forget the violence of those moments whose repression is all
too often the ground of prosody. Surplus -- as expropriated value, as
excess, as remainder -- refuses to be siphoned off, and spare parts blurt
out a general strike against the sutured whole.

Kim Rosenfield?s Good Morning-- Midnight-- (Roof), at its core, challenges
the separation of pleasure and social critique. Here feminist theory
simultaneously picks apart a feast of fashion and (gendered) self-help
discourse while taking delight in the festivities. Rosenfield's is a
carnivalesque aesthetic that combines a strong ear for the pure pop of
advertising lingo and a surgeon's touch when it comes to cut'n'pasting.
She avoids easy moralizing over consumerism and media, implicating our
own appetites within the omnipresent public discourse of commodity
aesthetics.

In Jocelyn Saidenberg?s Cusp (Kelsey St.), position is implicated in the
critical turn that would dislocate it. There is such sobriety, such a
questioning concern for what is necessary and justifiable in these
poems -- also doubt as to how to determine such necessity ñ that one is
tempted to consider Cusp a dark book, at least a somber one.  But this
is that rare type of darkness that steadies and reminds the mind, the
opposite of what is easy and therefore forgettable.  Cusp reads as the
pure product of a specific dynamic: the one that exists between trying
to see things (or words) at the level of their form, while still
striving to recall their practical application. (For more on Cusp, see
Camille Roy?s review in this issue).

Finally, SPT?s board members are pleased to name Carl Rakosi as the
inaugural recipient of our Lifetime Achievement Award. His early
appearance in An Objectivist Anthology situates him in a strain of
American modernism whose clarity of method and depth of ethical and
political engagement exert a profound influence on all sorts of poetic
endeavor today. His commitment to the demands of such work is evident
through his celebrated New Directions publications, Amulet (1967), and
Ere-Voice (1971), and continues into two beautiful recent titles
published by Etruscan Books, The Earth Suite (1997) and The Old Poet?s
Tale (1999). Throughout, Rakosi has worked not so much after Pound?s
"make it new," as after the imperative to make it exact -- both precise
and exacting. Perhaps the best characterization of his work remains that
offered by George Oppen, introducing Rakosi at a March 12, 1975 reading
for the Poetry Center: "It seems to me that Rakosi is the most polished
of poets, but his is a strange and unheard of polish, made of distance
and intimacy, marvelously elegant: a place few have been carried to."

(by the way, not like Cage at all; the effects are calculated, and serve
as catalysts only - I hope the explanation below will give you some idea -
Alan)



Cien2 Su4 Vun2 (Hakka) Inversion -


[Ellen Zweig and I continue the translation of the 1000 Character Classic.
In the Chinese examination system, the characters were used to indicate
the applicant's home lane with its examination cells. Each character is
used once. We translate in accordance with three dictionaries and two
software programs, plus a grammar of T'ang poetry and other assorted aids.
The original is in couplets; after a semi-mythological beginning, the
essay settles into homilies, platitudes, proverbs, advice. It was used as
a study tool, by children learning the characters for the first time.

Here, we find our own rhythm in translation, moving back and forth across
the 4-character lines, assembling and reassembling, searching for tropes
and parallels; suddenly the line is illuminated, and its aura extends to
the next or previous.

The characters are old-style, not simplified; many are out of date. At
times, in the Japanese software, the character will be combined with
another (main) radical, existing only as a subsidiary remnant. Almost
never does the knowledge of radicals aid in interpretation; it seems, at
least in relation to the Japanese, to be an awkward process of elimination
as well as accumulation.

The best search strategy is the boolean/root system in the Japanese soft-
ware; this can be followed by character combinations in the Chinese soft-
ware. When all else fails, a Chinese dictionary from 1930 is consulted;
with its 10,000 + characters, it works well, in terms of radical and
stroke count. But even here there are problems; characters within have up
to 48 strokes, often drawn in a space smaller than a quarter-inch.

We are un-knowing of Chinese; Ellen is studying it, and I am still use-
lessly pursuing Japanese. But we enter a certain zone in this translation,
a connection with something barely comprehended. For myself, the tenuous
readings of the words plays into my own writing; bridging character to
character is bridging English to English; it is a process of thinking into
the void, not unlike the text itself.

Below is an inversion study in which the translation is first reversed,
then sent through software that eliminates duplicate words, then reversed
again (specifically, tac -> perl program eliminating duplicates -> tac).
The language slowly becomes more coherent towards the end. And we are only
between a quarter and a third of the way through.]

Clearly you could find also sorts of permutations: but what you are "playing
with" there is intersting: I dont think that the US want to find Bin Laden
(I think they invented him or he's an agent and is walking around New york
with a completely different "look", maybe he's got some ideas from
Jackson)...he's better not apprehended: just as the Soviet Union was
something that the US could "spark off" before it got all wishy washy and
"collapsed" now the muslims, arabs bin Laden have somewhat replaced
communism as a bogey.  Control of oil is a motive of all the major countries
including Russia (I suspect that their interets in Nothern Iraq has
"panicked " the B admin or its a factor...) in fact if the US take over in a
big way they'll possibly even extract ALL the oil into the US: they will
also be in a good position to control the drug industry....I dont think any
body is convinced by Bush - he has nothing: he's hopeless even for the US
economy: he undertaxes the rich and taxes the poor...follow him and there
will be in coming times  100 times the numbers on welfare (if you have any
welfare systems)...

This is all probably a waste time. America is the Big Unlistening Ear with
One Eye: No Man united with Cyclops and laughing as the grisle drips from
the drivelling gristle.....

I'm reading about and reading Pound's Cantos and can symapathise somewhat
with his position vis a vis the US at that time - in hindsight. He could see
the hypocrisy of US policies and the corruption of international capitalism
and money lending...his anti-semitism was of course a kind of rhetoric as he
had Jewish friends eg Zukofsky etc He was initially motivated by his horror
of the wastage of the First World War. hence his  "for  an old bitch gone in
the teeth..a gross of battered books, a botched civilisation,...the
accelerated grimace of the age..." and the image of the dead caught on
barbed wire...and so on.  Richard Taylor.

being a platform for women writers, the curators
promote work that is experimental in form, connects
with other art forms, and is socially/politically
active in content.  Alongside the readings,
BELLADONNA* supports its artists by publishing
commemorative pamphlets of their work on the night of
the event.  Please contact Rachel Levitsky

Hi Jefferson,

i have been wondering about your models.
here is one of mine. it proposes to look
at a truer form of composition. it can
compose in three seconds. it has pictures
and underlining too.

it even has a jsp-like interface if you'd like to design
your own landing page. let me know. as the current

Laird:

The Fall 1987 Review of Contemporary Fiction  (vol. 7,
no. 3: Elmwood Park, IL) had a 226-page tribute to
Harry Mathews,--- with interviews by John Ash and John
Ashbery, and more than a dozen essays by the likes of
Edmund White, Barbara Guest, W.C. Bamberger (who has
done a similar book-sized bibliography and tribute to
Kenward Elmslie), etc.,--- including Barrett Watten's
notes on a 4-day symposium Mathews gave in San
Francisco.

Tomasz Mirkowicz, who translated ~The Conversions~
into Polish, has a 10-page essay exclusively on that
novel.  In it, he makes a great deal of claiming that
scene after scene are based on Rousselian traces of
the Romance word "alba" (white): the Gypsies who
ravaged the Silver Glen uprooted the clematis there
(botanical name: Clematis vitALBA, a sort of surrogate
for Frazer's mistletoe); the color-blind Mr. Wayl
thinks the narrator has purple eyes (i.e., is an
ALBino); Mirkowicz takes the "noddy" that appears to
Williaus in the Arctic ("almost certainly") to be an
ALBAtross; the chain attaching Wayl's detonating watch
from waistcoat pocket to button would have been an
ALBert; Felix's invention depends on the reflective
power of ALBedo; etc., etc., etc., with alba
"hypogrammes" in Spanish and German, too.  (Some of
Mirkowicz's "evidence" falters under the [good,
creative] weight of his own seeming obsessivism, but .
. . Mirkowicz had interviewed Mathews three years
previous and admits to no contradiction by him.)  ". .
.at one point the dismayed narrator finally exclaims,
'Enough of Alva!'"

Similarly, the earls of Mar: Johnstone's experiments
involve MARiotte's law; "pyrites crystals" are known
as MARcasites.

Mirkowicz focusses a lot on mythological White Goddess
clues throughout ~The Conversions.~  (Ergo, ~The
Golden Bough,~ of course.)  The (second) only adze
engraving left unexplained in the novel portrays the
moon goddess Selene.  The Hekate Triple Goddess is
encoded into the name of Miss Gabrielle Dryrein of
2890 Valentine Avenue: "drei" (Ger., "three) - "rein"
(Fr., "queen").  The many (dentata) "beautifully
colored oval shells with a narrow opening with
toothlike protrusions along the edges" are Cypraeida
shells, sacred to Venus, who was know as Cypria.

The festschrift provides other, diverse angles and
details into sleuthing out Mathews, and it concludes
with ---as of 1987--- a comprehensive bibliography on
him: the secondary sources (reviews) for ~The
Conversions~ include Anthony Burgess, Howard Nemerov,
and Terry Southern.  Interesting details: in the Ash
interview, Mathews points out that the color sequence
established during the worm race recurs throughout the
book.  His Italian translator found the end-of-book
revelation that the narrator is a mulatto so upsetting
that she gave the secret away in her introduction,
because she "couldn't stand the idea" of people being
surprised that way.  In the Ashbery interview,
---which is enchanting for their old pal good-natured
ribbing of each other (Ashbery mainly ribbing the
supremely aristocratic and more patricianly restrained
Mathews)--- he identifies his writing ("the movement
is what matters, rather than whatever is being said")
with a quote from the English composer Birtwhistle:
you could change all the notes in it and it would
still be the same piece. (The Roussel that Mathews
says was his model is Roussel's play, ~Poussiere de
soleils.~)

Let me know if you can't find the issue.  (I'm
reporting from a copy I checked out from the library,
---out of collegiality toward your request.  I twice
scoured the entire half dozen bookshelves throughout
my living room, hall, and wardrobe room, unsuccessful!
at finding the copy I bought off the stands back when;
but I know I still have it here somewhere.  New York
Public Library apparently has it, too.)

Dear Tracy,
            I have written many anagrams over the years, the term
anagram should really be renamed "Antigram" as most anagrams appear
opposite in meaning to the original word or sentence. I wrote an 11
line poem-anagram in 1992 which was called "Poseidon's Spider" it
was published in my 1996 poetry book which also features Lipograms,
and univocalics. If you would like a copy of Poseidon's Spider just
write back to me . By the way did you know that the name "Suez" is
the name "Zeus" spelled backwards?

Subject: "workshop" vs. "poetics": craft / process

Having just begun an MFA program, I am incredibly interested in this thread,
and here is the question with which I am currently struggling:  how can I be
a productive member of the workshop? The instructor is decidedly steering us
away from traditional workshop modes, even tactfully fighting certain
students' suggestions that we adopt a more traditional workshop model (more
in terms of procedures, as opposed to discussion, I suppose, and some of
whom are probably reading this), emphasizing reading outside work as much
as, if not more than, traditional "workshopping," so I feel we're off to a
good start. An excellent one, really, in my mind.  Now, what can I do to
help this along, make this a productive experience for me and for those to
whom I offer comments?  (We're working towards answers to this in class as
well, but I'm curious what list members think).

Case in point:  Although I entered the workshop (and the program) completely
down with the idea of eschewing traditional workshop bullshit, I believe my
first actual "critical" comment in the class was "I'm not so sure about this
second to last line." (And I do believe there are cases where this comment
is relevant, maybe this was even one of them, but that's perhaps beside the
point)  So, I've obviously got some serious de-programming of my own to do.
I did graduate to posing the question last week as to how we might usefully
"criticize" a less narrative, much denser piece.  We spent some time just
talking about the inner workings of the piece, the effect of each word in
connection with the others, the significance of the undertaking of the
specific poem at all but I felt an internal pressure to offer some
"constructive criticism."  Perhaps this is not nearly as useful as I have
been taught it is, however?  Perhaps it is better to just talk about what we
see/hear/experience before us, how the poem is situated in a larger context
(of what? the world? depends on the piece, I suppose)  and then leave it at
that, trusting that the process is much more internal and, dare I say it,
organic than any traditional workshop model would ever lead us to believe?

Given that the program I'm in is geared toward a more experimental model,
I'm especially interested in Kasey's example #3, Commodified Alternativity.
How does one identify this (esp. in one's own writing -- another struggle du
jour) and thoughtfully deal w/ it in a workshop? Were I infinitely
well-versed in various schools of experimental poetics, critical theory, the
works, I guess I'd feel more confident in making the distinction between
genuine/imitative (commodified). But I've read and heard enough to look
at/hear a lot of what's out there and think, "I've seen this a million times
already," so I guess that's a starting point. But here's another quandary:
oftentimes when I think that, it's not when I'm evaluating my classmates'
work, but the work of more "established" writers being held up as models in
the latest de riguer journals and readings, for example. I mean, aren't
there times when an experiment by a first-year MFA student for some reason
holds little currency, but the same experiment by, say, someone whose been
around St. Mark's for some time (say, between two and forty years -- and I
only choose St. Mark's as it's such an easy example) is bestowed with a
certain 'legitimacy.' Which is the true alternative and which is the
commodity? How do we decide?

All in all, I'd say I'm working myself toward some answers (but only some!)
just by writing this (which perhaps affirms the notion that 'process' trumps
'craft'), but I'm very curious as to what others think and interested in
(even hungry for) feedback.

All in all, I'd say I'm working myself toward some answers (but only
some!) just by writing this (which perhaps affirms the notion that
'process' trumps 'craft'), but I'm very curious as to what others
think and interested in (even hungry for) feedback.>

I Reply:

I really like the slant rhyme of "craft" and "feedback" here at the end.
I think it provides a sense of musical resolution to your post.

So what does a writer do with that kind of information? Is this
something that will make the poem stronger? And if the poem is made
stronger though this . . . does that in any way help the next poem?

I think the biggest problem with line criticism, or even dwelling on the
"poem before us" is that, in talking about _this_ poem, the poet is
overly influenced into doing this very same thing the next time. If the
group likes it.

I would think, perhaps, that talking about the world around the poem,
or the world revealed by the poem, or "what form is this poem setting
up for itself", would be more productive for the poet to hear in the
long run. More aesthetics, less line talk.

This all sounds so teachy though. It probably would work just as well
to have people bring in poems (their only copy), burn them, and then
tell them to bring the same poem back next week. That would be
constructive criticism, as well.

Best,
  JG

My workshop "Translating Silences" will be offered again at Barnard College
Center for Research on Women, 3009 Broadway, NYC 10027, starting October 2nd.
 Six Wednesdays, 6:30 to 8:00 p.m.  For information, call 212-305-2067.

Obviously, those of us who "teach" workshops must believe the job worth
doing.
I feel that feedback can generate creative energy for everyone in the room.
Of course we will talk about what a particular line/word/break/space/etc.
seems to do within the poem; but most of all the poet benefits from what is
stimulated within each of the others.  I see "poetics" as impossible without
"craft."
Articulating critique is, I believe, of important benefit to thinking towards
one's own work.
All best to all,
Charlotte Mandel

I reply, much in the fashion of J Gallaher:

But this assumes that all poets in workshops try to please the rest of the
poets. My experience in the NYU workshop was that, although a lot of poets
were poet-pleasers, which retarded their development, there were some poets
who kept trying to befuddle, to defy the standards of the group--in fact to
*displease*. This often meant very unusual & unpredictable but very bad
poetry. Sometimes it meant a triumph that eluded the group's radar;
sometimes this, in turn, meant a recalibration of the group's radar.
Sometimes it simply meant a surprising triumph.

A few who escape from workshops actually benefit from it.
Others--well--others continue to go to workshops wherever they can find
them: conferences, community colleges, living rooms, etc.  We had a person
in one workshop who was older, and confessed she'd been going to workshops
for years.  Robert Bly asked her when she planned to start writing her own
poetry!  She was visibly embarrassed.  I didn't think that was very nice of
Robery Bly.

My conclusion: all of life is a workshop, and we are but poor poem-toting
students.

Subject:      Jackson Mac Low at 80...

   I was at Irving Stone's 80th birthday party at Tonic..where the food was
good and John Zorn played...so i managed to miss the unendurable tedium of all
the readers & perform artistes at Jack Mac's 80th...

    But at the apres party...i did notice that this was a group that couldn't
figure out warm soda needed ice..that there wasn't one pretty girl in the room
18 to 80...& every one from Steve Clay to Lewish Warsh to yours truly was
putting on weight & under lots post 9/11 pressure....happy birthday to all
haveing one..DRn....

SUPERNATURAL LIFE


  After some reflection I came to the rather startling conclusion that
thoughts are as supernatural as past history after death. I simply
discovered to my surprise that thinking is unnatural. I then reflected a
little more and discovered that I have no day-to-day existence. It is a
life-to-life existence and life is supernatural.

- Clarice Lispector, Selected Cronicas, p. 77

A big part of me though thought we'd be back in a couple of days

Holland, though, thought he recalled something else

though thought to ward off enchantment

though thought to be extinct

His boss, though, thought Larry was really smart

Others, though, thought there was still an element of self-protection

No one, though, thought it was odd

though thought to be permanent, they do not last

emotion is impossible without thought, though thought is possible without emotion

a few scientists at the time, though, thought that there existed exotic objects in space

though thought of as merely myth

The troops, though, thought it was the other way around

Another possibility, though thought to be less likely at this time

I have always thought myself a thief, though thought little of its meaning

though thought to be a game of chance

Britain though, thought that the threat of Germany had been extinguished

Jack, though, thought otherwise

Many individuals, though, thought the disruption was minimal

Usually trustworthy though thought corrupt occasionally

For instance, though thought of as "American,"

Heat can increase the blueness, though thought to reduce the mystical effects of the stone

though thought disorder is more severe in schizophrenia

Many locals though thought they'd bring energy and employment

It was odd, though, thought Thelonius

though thought of as a vegetable, it is a fruit... specifically a berry

Many fans, though, thought the country album was a joke in itself

It's as though thought is the ink in the pen of life, and we are the illustrators

Williams, though, thought Harrington gave Crispin no other choice

The Peruvian "coneheads', though thought to be like the bound skulls of Egyptians

Nobody, though, thought our president would be stupid enough to lie

We though thought that it would revolutionize the speed by which we processed information

actually more of a confusion though thought of as a riddle

even though thought and structure arise in it like waves on the ocean

actual words probably don't make a difference- though thought projection may be helpful

His old friend, John Burroughs, though, thought the whole bay was "weird,"

I expect that he though thought he had seen the last of the crazy English

One thing was clear though, thought Jean-Paul to himself

India, though thought of by the First World as a Third World country, comprises four worlds

Everyone around here, though, thought it sounded, you know, kind of sexy

literal vision works hard to perfect technique
        portraits found in laborious reality
depth the subject of no grandeur
life attempted with bric-a-brac
primordial slots notched into supernaturalism
        disseminating underlying foregrounding
inter-linear readings flaunted his intimacy
        adequate difference delayed
directly the last thing stood throughout the century
        logic monosignificant, molecular
visible material equivalent to substance
        the eye builds on what it sees

What whiteness is the strait ribacge
of the sky (a crime suffocating
catacombs beneath emulations of aim)

that we undulate like water molds
over emptinesses that impress
charms into our hands? A cessation aches

or aids our fungal creeds; depths like
thimble-lit bellcaves for thickness, and

you, who assume lucid husks, kick random
passions into umbrage, wetting the eggs
we've both thumbed through, soon aggregate.

Garage-bands of girls groom themselves on
a dictation traded shorthand, as if circuits

in the cuticle range pain this precipitation.
We know better; you, who massage
jaw-broth of my bitter towers' slaked

gravy-valve, come to me in hunched boulder
itches, begging me to sift your flesh

for warmth. Selfhood, as a motor of my tongue,
omnivorously concatenates an apt frill on
dishes that remember asthma; thrillingly patient,

you medicate my spores.

A FINAL REMINDER THAT THE POETRY PROJECT IS RUNNING THE FOLLOWING WORKSHOPS
THIS FALL.

RESERVE YOUR PLACE NOW TO AVOID DISAPPOINTMENT!

***

COGNITIVE DISSONANCE: A WRITING WORKSHOP - ANNE WALDMAN
TUESDAYS AT 7 pm: 4 sessions, October 22nd - November 12th

Waldman writes, "It is not safety but the unevenness of life that allows
artistic breakthrough. Shaky ground is best when trying to find new ways to
walk. In this workshop, we will play with rhizomic collage, hypnologic
states, investigate living in the "eternal war" zone, perform cross-genre
experimentation & vocalize cultural intervention. Texts for study & respons=
e
will be provided."

Anne Waldman is the author of over 30 books including, most recently, Vow t=
o
Poetry: Essays, Interviews & Manifestos (Coffee House Press) and Marriage: =
A
Sentence (Penguin Poets).

***

THE POET IN THE WORLD - JAIME MANRIQUE
FRIDAYS AT 7 pm: 10 sessions, beginning October 18th
Manrique describes "The Poet in the World" as "a workshop for students
interested in writing poems that extend beyond the realm of autobiography.
We will look at the works of poets such as Walt Whitman, Octavio Paz, Pablo
Neruda, Cavafy, Wislawa Szymborska, Ceslaw Milosz, Agha Shahid Ali, Tomas
Salamun and others whose imagination is deeply personal but also rooted in
politics, history, and issues of national identity. Students will be asked
to write in specific forms such as insult poems, satire, etc."

Jaime Manrique's titles include the novels Colombian Gold, Latin Moon in
Manhattan, and Twilight at the Equator and poetry titles My Night with
Federico Garc=EDa Lorca; Tarzan, My Body, Christopher Columbus; and Sor
Juana=B9s Love Poems, co-translated with Joan Larkin.

***

WORKSHOP - RENEE GLADMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12 pm: 10 sessions, beginning October 12th
Gladman describes her workshop: "In this class we will write toward the
middle, that terrain between poetry and fiction where the shape and tone of
the line or sentence is as much an idea about narrative as are the notions
of time, place, and character. Through a series of in-class writing
exercises and discussions the class will imagine and test out those
perspectives of storytelling that work against conventional assumptions of
linear progression, authentic voice, and resolution."

Renee Gladman is the author of  Juice (Kelsey St. Press), and two chapbooks=
,
Arlem (Idiom Press) and Not Right Now (Second Story Books). Former editor o=
f
Clamour, she is currently editor of the chapbook imprint, Leroy.

SURREALISM AND AUTOMATIC WRITING - JANET HAMILL
TUESDAYS AT 7 pm: 4 sessions, November 19th =AD December 10th
The writers and painters of Surrealism drew their imagery from dreams, and
other non-rational states, and practiced automatism. This workshop will
examine the climate in which the movement was born, its philosophy, the wor=

The Crave
by Kit Robinson

        Atelos is pleased to announce the publication on November 1,
2002 of The Crave by Kit Robinson (www.atelos.org/crave.htm).

About the book:
        As is often the case with artists (as with athletes) whose moves
seem effortless, Kit Robinson writes inimitable work. No one can
replicate his moves, no one can equal what he has done with the various
procedures he has devised and the bewildering though seemingly simple
forms that he has invented. The poems of his new book, The Crave, are
all structured around a 3-line stanza capable of seemingly endless
variation. Imagine Jelly Roll Morton meeting Emily Dickinson in
21st-century Las Vegas to compose occasional metaphysical stanzas.
        The poems of The Crave, while being immediate and even intimate
at times, are markedly edgy. Throughout his career as a writer, Kit
Robinson has scrutinized the way we live - the materials with which we
compose our lives and the assumptions that structure them. His writings
are masterful, often beautiful, always smart, and very funny. As someone
thinking about contemporary life, there is much that he sees about which
he has remained unconvinced. The work is characteristically skeptical,
taking events, both in private experience and in the shared experiences
of the cultural sphere, not only with a grain of salt but with a dash of
cayenne. This skepticism is a manifestation of a brilliant critical mind
at work - and one capable of producing poems that offer enormous
pleasure.
        Using materials from news media, work place documents, popular
culture, dreams, financial institutions, and the technology industry as
well as from the daily debris of neighborhoods and scraps of
domesticity, Kit Robinson's work is about negotiating a way through the
contemporary milieu in quest of a good history. The writing can be quick
and it can be hilarious, but it speaks from experience and with that
experience there has come wisdom.

About the author:
        Kit Robinson has been active as a poet, teacher, curator, and
performer on the San Francisco Bay Area poetry scene for 30 years. In
addition to The Crave, he is the author of 15 books, the most recent of
which include Cloud Eight (written with Alan Bernheimer), Democracy
Boulevard, Balance Sheet, and Counter Meditation. While being one of the
poets most closely associated with Language writing since its emergence
in the 1970s, Kit Robinson's interests are eclectic, even willfully
idiosyncratic, and his work has responded to influences as diverse as
Wallace Stevens and Ted Berrigan. Kit Robinson has received awards from
the National Endowment for the Arts, the California Arts Council, and
the Fund for Poetry. He was a founding member of the Bay Area's Poets
Theater, which flourished from 1978 to the mid 80s, working both as a
playwright and an actor. During that time, he also served as the
coproducer and cohost of a weekly KPFA show named after his poem, "In
the American Tree." He lives in Berkeley and currently works as a
communications executive in the information technology industry.

About the project:
        Atelos was founded in 1995 as a project of Hip's Road. It is
devoted to publishing, under the sign of poetry, writing which
challenges the conventional definitions of poetry. All the works
published as part of the Atelos project are commissioned specifically
for it, and each is involved in some way with crossing traditional genre
boundaries, including, for example, those that would separate theory
from practice, poetry from prose, essay from drama, the visual image
from the verbal, the literary from the non-literary, and so forth. The
Atelos project when complete will consist of 50 volumes; The Crave is
volume 13. The project directors and editors are Lyn Hejinian and Travis
Ortiz; cover production and design is by Ree Katrak.

the following piece was written by Travis Nichols...I
asked him if it was okay if I posted it to the
listserv as I feel it sheds some "Platonic" light on
the white box space...

noah

Self Portrait with Art Scene : Experiencing the
Uncanny in NYC


“Someone called the White Box today and asked about
your piece,” Juan Puntes, owner of the White Box
Gallery, said as we walked down the hall.

“She was very pushy. She sounded like one of your
teachers, maybe. She wanted to know why the piece
wasn’t up. I didn’t know if I should tell her, how
much detail I should go into, how it wasn’t part of
our Six Feet Under series, how it wasn’t sanctioned,
how White Box will never admit to having anything to
do with it.”

We had stopped walking now and Juan leveled a look at
me that spoke all the disgust his seemingly casual
story implied.

“So I told her,” he went on, “the piece had been taken
down and if she had any further questions she could
contact you, the artists.”

I nodded and smiled. “That sounds fair enough.”

Juan sniffed and turned to his wife and assistant who
were carrying out the last dismantled pieces of Paul,
David and my installation, “Clap Your Hands Say
Yeah!!!” I felt bad that these two young women had to
lug the stuff around in their nice clothes, but as
David said later, you don’t really have to feel bad
for the henchman’s assistants when they go down with
the ship in a bad action movie, and this experience,
my first with the New York art world, with all its
hyperbole, ego and one-dimensional morality seemed
perfectly analogous to any of the past six or so
Nicolas Cage movies. So I let them lug.

****


The White Box opened in 1998 on W. 26th St. in the
Chelsea district in New York City. It is not a
gallery, like say the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, but a
non-profit alternative space run by an international
board of directors. Being a non-profit space usually
means an ability to side step the rather stuffy rules
and nepotism the gallery scene has been notorious for
since the big money Basquiats and Schnabels rolled
through Mary Boone in the early 80s. The nearby and
similarly named White Columns space has, for example,
been the launching pad for William Wegman of
dog-people picture fame, and Sean Landers formerly of
SPIN’s backpage, both of whom probably wouldn’t have
had first shows without White Columns’ non-profit
generosity. So far, the White Box has shied away from
its potential for launching new art, relying more on
group shows anchored by relatively big names like
Carolee Schneeman and Gunter Brus. The White Box
summer series, open to students at Bard, Whitney ISP
and such, seemed to those who knew about it fertile
ground for a White Collumns-like new art first.



My first encounter with the space was in April or so
of this year, when my friend Katie, who interned
there, asked if I wanted to go see “Effervescence,” an
opening wherein the artist was to dissolve four
hundred thousand alka seltzer tablets in one Dionysian
plop plop fizz fizz extravaganza. If nothing else,
this sounded like an irreverent and auspicious
launching fit for an alternative space. So after a few
drinks in the neighborhood with Paul and David, we
went to the White Box, open and interested.

In theory, a show like “Effervescence” is fun and
engaging— a lightly cerebral piece of performance art
with a healthy sense of sensual play. In practice,
though, it was as sodden and oppressive as a city
council meeting in Fort Wayne. Two guys dressed like
waiters carried pitchers of water behind the traipsing
artist who occasionally dipped her hands in the
pitchers and dramatically splashed water on some of
the tablets hung in chicken wire up on the walls.
Rather limp red bubbles slowly appeared. Not only was
the art oppressively lame, the whole White Box
atmosphere could be summed up by the array of dirty
looks given to crying two-year old and her mother in
the audience. During a break David, Paul and I skipped
outside where more than one passerby gawked in the
large shop window, rightfully suspecting something
interesting could be going on down there in the
gallery. Mostly, the gawkers shuffled on after a
minute or so. Paul and I watched and recalled an old
professor who offhandedly declared that Nazism was
like bad art—a notion applicable to “Effervescence” if
it could be called art. I said it couldn’t. Paul said
it could. And thus we had the discussion many such
performance pieces are said to provoke.


****


A few months later, Katie mentioned she hadn’t
received any proposals for the White Box’s summer
series “Six Feet Under.” She explained the series was
of weeklong installations in which viewers weren’t
allowed entry into the gallery space proper, only the
view from the big window. This year the installations
were to follow the theme “Gugeinheimlicheit,” based on
a Carl Skelton essay in which he explored the idea of
the architectural uncanny and the museum. Paul, who
had begun seriously painting about a year before, and
I, who had just taken a class with James Young on,
among other things, the architectural uncanny, said we
might be able to come up with something if she wanted.
Katie sounded relieved. After a week or so of
thinking, we came up with a few ideas, many good but
unworkable (decorating the gallery like an 19th
Century school house and putting a DJ in a duncecap up
in front of the slateboard), a few more bad but
workable (covering the window with snapshots of the
gallery’s inside), and one or two good and workable
(details to follow). Katie told us to write a proposal
for one good and workable idea to give to Juan, her
boss, then wait and see if he would approve it.


****


Quickly, before getting into the meat of this story,
I’d like to say Paul and I weren’t setting out to
expose the White Box, or, in turn, the New York Art
Scene, as a vacuous, insider playground for bored rich
people. We didn’t think the scene was so stupid and
pretentious that we could easily waltz in with a
half-hearted idea and be just as good as anyone else.
We thought quite the opposite in fact, that we were
smart and aesthetically astute enough to waltz in with
a whole-hearted idea we truly believed in and be just
as good as anyone else. There is a difference.


****


Our idea was this: to cover the White Box window with
a giant piece of decorative aluminum and to leave out
keys and other tools with which people could scratch
into the metal. The window then, instead of being a
conduit through which people would passively gaze at
off-limits art, would become the art itself that
viewers could actively experience and participate in
by scratching their names or whatever into it. In
fact, like all underdetermined works of art, this
piece wouldn’t really be finished until the audience
made their mark on it. We would call it “Clap Your
Hands Say Yeah!!!” after a piece of graffiti in
Brooklyn. Though it wasn’t perfect, or as shockingly
innovative as we had hoped, we thought this fairly
simple idea would provide a fun and engaging
experience—everybody likes to tag, right?—galleries
normally don’t provide despite their ubiquitous
lip-service. It would be the type of art we would hope
to find at a non-profit alternative space. Paul and I
wrote up a proposal explaining as much. Katie approved
it and sent it on to Juan who was in Spain at the
time. He emailed her back his approval.

Over the next couple of days, we tried to come up with
a plan to get Clap Your Hands Say Yeah!!! out of our
heads and into the real world. In his approval email,
Juan gave us some pretty severe spatial restrictions
(the piece couldn’t come out more than four inches
from the wall, etc.) and, on top of that, any building
supplies we needed would only come in the woefully
small 4’ x 8’ standard size. The window space was
roughly 8’ x 10’ so we were in a bind. After a fair
amount of hemming, hawing and haggling with Brooklyn’s
tinsmiths, we figured the best plan would be to put
together a flat plywood frame to put over the window,
paint the plywood white, and nail six sheets of
aluminum to it. We spent a Saturday hauling wood and
aluminum around Chelsea on a hand-cart, painting and
affixing it, only to end up feeling about as sickly
and stupid as a Pine Box Derby entrant who has mental
images of rocket blasters and flame decals but no
hands with which to build anything. We still had a
week until the Thursday opening, so we left the White
Box hoping to come up with something better by then.

****

On Wednesday Juan came back from Spain.

Katie called me at about 10 am from her job at the
Pollock/Krasner Foundation.

“Hey, um, Juan wants to talk to you guys about the
piece. He’s kind of pissed.”

Then Paul called from his job at the Brooklyn Bureau
of Public Service.

“Hey, um, Jaun wants us to start over or scrap it or
something. I don’t know. He sounded pissed.”

So I called Juan from the apartment where I had been
sitting in my boxers drinking coffee.

“Hey, um, Juan, what do you want?”

“Hello, yes, though we are a non-profit gallery we
don’t need to look like a non-profit gallery and your
piece is . . . it is . . . (disgusted sound)”

“Okay, well, we have some ideas about how to change it
. . . “

“I am a little jet-legged, okay, so it may seem like
I’m yelling but I just got back from Spain and I don’t
have time to do this art for you. I am a sculptor by
trade, okay? I haven’t read your thesis, but I know
you want to do something with reflection . . . “

“Well, we had hoped . . . “

“First, you need to get rid of the aluminum. Maybe
Mylar would work instead. Second . . . “

And so it began with Jaun. He gave some us some good
ideas and some bad ideas and I wrote down what I
could. We said we’d meet on Thursday at 9 am to try
and get something ready for the 6 pm opening.

Paul took the day off work and I got up before 10 am
to get started. We had ordered $150 worth of aluminum
to be delivered at 9, and we got some industrial
strength rubber cement and some rollers to apply it.
We could see our previous effort through the window
and it looked a little shabby but workable. If Juan
wasn’t happy, we thought, we’d make him happy. That
is, if he ever showed up.

An hour and a half later, he did show up looking like
the pissed off Spanish napoleon posing for DKNY he
turned out to be. He told us to wait downstairs, to
throw out the older piece, to make a drawing for a new
piece, to forget it and go home, to wait outside, to
not touch the art, to bring our own screws next time,
to remove the screws, to finish by 4, to stop eating
lunch, to stay out of the gallery . . . I hadn’t
encountered this type of little man with a little
power syndrome since high school (public, of course,
which probably sinks my art-world cred). The guy was a
total asshole. But Paul and I had decided that we
wanted to get this thing up for the opening if it was
at all within our capabilities, so we kow-towed to
Juan. We apologized. We waited downstairs. We took
apart the old piece. We came up with a new piece. We
ran to the hardware store. We cleared a space and we
began building.

Juan left us alone for most of the day, only
occasionally coming down from his office to talk with
his assistants who were hanging art for an auction to
be held after our opening. Once, Paul asked him how he
felt about our progress.

“I feel nothing. I don’t have feelings,” he replied.

“Because you’re a MACHINE!” I said thoughtfully, but
he didn’t seem to notice.

“I can guarantee my idea,” he put in rather
perplexingly before heading back upstairs, “but I
can’t guarantee your craftsmanship.”

Unfortunately, neither Paul, David, who had come to
help, nor I could guarantee our craftsmanship either.
We hadn’t, as Juan pointed out, spent much time in
Materials and Methods classes, but we had our idea and
damn it we were going to try to pull it out of our
heads. Our new plan was to build a rectangle frame of
2’’x4’’ boards vertically reinforced with other
2’’x4’’ boards to mount around the window, put the old
plywood on this new frame, then glue the new aluminum
onto that. The whole thing seemed to me like a complex
underwire bra for an underdeveloped ten year old girl,
but Juan had wanted it this way so we did it. The
problem was, we spent most of the day building this
gigantic bra inside the gallery, without knowing if it
had any chance of fitting outside on the, um, window
where it would count. We drilled, hammered, and sawed
feverishly toward six o’clock.

In one of Plato’s famous dialogues, Socrates proves to
Nemo that no one ever really learns anything. People
only recollect what they already know but have
forgotten by virtue of being big dumb cave-dwelling
humans. Socrates demonstrates this by talking with a
slave boy who has had no formal schooling yet is able
to follow and sometimes lead Socrates through ideas of
basic geometry. “And if the truth of all things always
existed in the soul,” Socrates concludes “then the
soul is immortal. Wherefore be of good cheer, and try
to recollect what you do not know, or rather do not
remember.” David Hume later argued that we know
nothing by recollection, as the slave boy seemed to
know geometry, but rather we learn everything by cold
hard experience. Hume’s ideas have held sway for the
past few hundred years, trumping those of Socrates,
and up until a few weeks ago I would have agreed with
him. But I would like to hereby cast my vote for the
idea of recollection because Paul, David and I,
ignorant slave boys all, felt something very much like
the recollection of some obvious a priori truth when
the last bolt outside the White Box window fit
perfectly into our newly built frame. In a very small
but real way it felt like we had slipped into the
Socratic world of pure forms, stolen one about 8’ x
10,’ and snuck it back into this shadowy world to
display to our fellow dumbbells. By 5:45, the whole
piece was done and it looked, impossibly, just as we
had imagined it.

Juan came out and gave it a once over, hand on his
hip. Elated, I bounded over to him and said, “Hey! You
were right! Thanks!” because he was right about some
very helpful things and I felt generously willing to
forget the very unhelpful things he was wrong about
(Mylar!?).

“I’m always right,” he replied with a straight face.
“What is this bump?”

“That’s from a swell in the sidewalk we didn’t
anticipate.”

“That’s unacceptable. If you were building a bridge,
you would have to start completely again or people
would die.”

This, of course, was true and right then I thanked the
God of Pure Forms I had not been contracted by this
man to build a bridge. He walked off in a huff.

Some friends came by and scratched into the aluminum
as we had hoped. Then some neighborhood kids scrawled
their names, then a huggy couple wrote about their
hugginess. Someone wrote “I Was Once,” someone else,
“Joshua Beckman needs love.” It began to rain, so we
headed in the door, but Juan wouldn’t let us into the
space (“The gallery’s closed”), so we crowded into the
foyer where he stood drinking a Pilsner Urqell.

“Now,” he said with a smirk. “Do you want to know
about some good art?”

“Sure,” we said huddling together. What else could we
say?

“Last year we had a piece up for the series by a group
of students. They had your idea, the idea of
subverting the gallery space and . . . “

“We weren’t trying to subvert the gallery space
really, we . . . “

“Well, that man in there, he’s an aritsit. He came out
to look at your work and he did like this (makes a bad
face), so that tells you.”

“Well, it might not be for everyone . . . ”

“But him, he’s an artist! He’s taken Materials and
Methods! He’s gone to SCHOOL! Listen, you were trying
to subvert my gallery, but I subverted you. I needed
something to cover the window, you wanted to cover my
window, so I let you put up your piece but I was only
using you because I needed your covering for the
auction tonight. You see, I subverted your subversion
. . . ”

And so it went for about two hours and so it had gone
all day and so, I’m sure, it continues as I write. We
left Mr. Puntes to his own peculiar brand of logic to
celebrate at a nearby bar, and though he had agreed in
his email from Spain to keep the installation up for a
week, he took it down within two days. He, or rather
some poor underling, tore the aluminum from the wood,
rolled it into a warped little spiral, dismantled the
frame, and hauled all the pieces to storage. After the
opening, Katie sent Juan her letter of resignation. A
week later we took the leftover aluminum to Paul’s
studio, leaving the alternative space to continue
eating its own tail as per the theme, like an unhomely
version of what a gallery, and in turn an art scene,
could be in a world of purer forms.

Someone just asked me if the "Washington D.C Poetry Hall of Fame" is a "real
thing." i.e.1) Does it exist? and 2) Is it meaningful - could inclusion in it
give anyone
any conceivable "bragging rights?" My guess would be no - but since I really
don't know, I thought I'd ask. Has anyone heard of this, um, institution?

And if it doesn't exist? Does that make it less meaningful? Let's assume at
the outset the WDCPHF does not exist. That doesn't automatically mean

1) you could/could not be included in it

2) you could/could not brag about it.

You don't have to necessarily hear about an institution to be included in
it. You just have to wake up one day and say:
"I am here/there." That is the way I arrived, par example, in the WDCPHF.
And I have never looked back.

The Coward


Last night I replugged into the dying power-grid, charging cell-phone,
nicads for the digital camera, this laptop. The phone depends on a
secondary grid of towers and antennas; the camera reproduces nothing
without downloading; the laptop connects to a third grid, internetwork-
ing. Generators operate in New York City, across the country; the
generator complex I've seen near Niagara is the largest confluence of
machinery I know. There is an indescribable silence of people, men and
women, behind the scenes, who have designed and built and tested the grids
and technology; these are people of the disappearances to come, the war
already glistening on the horizon.

The cell-phone conveys personal and political pessimisms across country
and countries, one unstable nation-state to another. The digital camera
bears witness, still, to nothing, a reproductive emphasis mainstreamed
into 3d animations and other explorations of language, sexuality, body.
When the war comes, the camera will be there, recording yet another
collapse, perhaps the final one, as humanity has already blasted and
slaughtered its way through much of the ecosphere.

And the computer, on its dying batteries, will repeatedly attempt to
connect on the broken copper-wire phone-grid; the heroics of the Net in
other wars will reduced to mute and brutal silence as screens flicker out
for the last time. But now the computer conveys otherwise, analysis after
analysis, exposing our government and their government, our evil ruling
class, and theirs, and their intermixing and interbreeding, and their
back-handing deals and kickbacks, and their unconcern for populations of
men, women, and children, as they slide back down into the game of war.

The analysis, like Freud's, is interminable, repetitious, necessary, and
depressing. It is necessary because it enables us to recognize, perhaps
for the last time, the evil humans are capable of. It is interminable
because new facts and situations come to light, as nations move closer to
war, to intolerance, to the right. And it is repetitious, because we have
witnessed all of this before - the duplicity, the violence of language
tending towards material violence, the impending holocaust-to-come.

The question repeatedly returns - what is to be done - beyond the talk and
protest and organizing; the one movement-moment of four hijacked planes
turned the world upside-down, more than any analysis or mass-movement has
ever done. It is not that empire has collapsed; it is that empire has
turned ever more hideous, paranoid, and closed-off, closed-down, taking
its armies and weapons with it. It is not that speech and analysis are
curtailed; it is that speech and analysis are rendered useless,
irrelevant.

So it is clear, just as it was in Imperial Rome, that what is to be done,
is being done-for-us; that it is already in motion, that protest and
accuracy and resistance are as futile as the turning-back of regimes
intent on conflagration.

If one thinks back to Imperial Rome - it was Lucan who died, not Nero;
analysis terminable and interminable would not have stayed the course of
events. What we are working on is the accuracy of our vision, our
witnessing, as if there were a transcendence to truth, as if truth were
part and parcel of natural or instrumental reason. If our analysis stops
at the gate of hopelessness, it does so because, beyond, is nothing but
erasure, and that is already done-for-us - from the internal violence of
transnational corporations, to the enormous lies of power that must, in
order to maintain itself, deceive.

I am well aware that I am contributing nothing here, that I have nothing
to contribute. At the very least, we need barricades, more and more
barricades; onslaught is slowed by stones and wood...

This is good. I like this kind of theing. But reading it quickly (which
means I need to read it slowly later ) the thought passed: it is very like a
lot of language poetry (at least in form)...Now, where can Langpo (or poetry
in general) go? One answer lies in Bernstien's book A poetics in which the
term absorptive and anti absorptive is used. Now the kind of writing (I'm ot
"singling out" your poem these are thoughts  maybe tangential) here can
disrupt and disjunct and surprise by breaking normative syntax (if not
completely) which has the net effect of stimulating and thought-provoking:
but from where and to whence then, if at all? The thing maybe (something
like some of Alan Sondheim's mixture of the techno-jargon, his links, his
use of computer technology and programming and philosophic ideas and the
sometimes quite distressing (yes one post by Alan I couldnt read but that's
my "problem" in the main that's not teh case) intrusion of the "real"  (sex,
blood, deat, politics and so on) whether we are in Alan's world or an
"imagined" one or a computer generated "picture"....looking back to possible
models of where to go (paradoxical to look back of course ) I thnnk of
Lowell's "Life Stuies with the mix of prose and poetry and also William's as
well as Pound etal: and also there are other indicators such as the Langpos'
works or the more recent writing and of course the Vispo etc etc

What I am doing is a kind of autobiographical thing which is  based on
certain main events in my own life and moves between there and the general
or the "objective" (hence between the absorptive and the anti absorptive:
(some of these elements are always present at least in Modernist writing but
maybe: I dont write things out in prose then laboriously render them into
poetry as Goldsmith did in writing "The Deserted Village" but that could be
a good method I might come to....the idea in a sense is that though I have a
loose structure (various themes - as Pound's Cantos did) there is no forcing
and the process may indeed lead me to such a strong or rigorous structure
but that will be sometime down a road that I dont know quite where I am
going: but certainly I want to intrude sometimes quite strongly with prose:
some harshness,some politics, some (probably futile) "calls to action", some
of me, some of others: then I want poems and the lyrical, the clear, as well
as "disjunctive" and "obscure", or poems that are prosic or even prosaic if
not prosodic; and also the element of play: a mix....now many people will
have similar methodologies: the obvious parallel is with the use of a Common
Book or a journal or the fascinating notes that artists keep, maybe
Bernadette Mayer's stuff or her methods..some connections...one (artist) in
NZ is Dennis O'Connner...but the variations are legion....

None of this is a criticism just a response ..kind of thinking out loud.

The thing that strikes me as essential here is the emphasis on reading
outside work.  And finding out who in the workshop values what outside work,
and for what reasons.  And whether there is anything like a "group
aesthetic" already in place (which could be a good or a bad thing or both),
or whether there is a significant amount of dissonance in terms of poetic
objectives and tastes (again, a potentially problematic and/or energizing
possibility).

If everyone is already "on the same page," e.g, interested in a certain kind
of procedurally oriented poetry, or in challenging "voice-based" poetics,
etc., you have the benefit of having some preliminary areas of inquiry laid
out for you in existing dialogues and critiques, a conversation which you
can simply (well, hopefully not "simply") pick up as you jump in.  The
downside to this would be the anxiety that people were just rejoining a
program "already in progress."  If you all already knew what kind of writing
you wanted to do, that is, why would you a need a workshop in the first
place, unless for the mutual gratification of compliments, encouragement,
etc.  If, on the other hand, there is a great deal of tension between
opposing literary values, you have the benefit of a forum in which you can
confront and analyze those tensions head-on, assuming the workshop leader is
willing and equipped to field the potential heatedness that might ensue.
The downside to this is the danger of the workshop becoming a big general
polemic, and the work itself getting lost in the shuffle.

To sum up everything I've said above: find out whether you all want to
achieve the same kinds of things, and if so, ask why, and if not, ask why
not.  Either way, go for the self-critical tough questions.

There's a skeptical part of me that says if someone is good enough to get
accepted into an MFA program, a workshop is the last thing they need.  A
sensitive, attentive, and constructively critical community of readers,
maybe, but not a round-table ritual of arbitrary dissection and "emotional
response" that threatens to result, at best, in the successful dissemination
and replication of the Master's values, and at worst, in a big useless
exchange of flattery for some and bad vibes for others.

Well, I think that the "traditional workshop model," no matter what it
professes in its press releases, *does* operate on the assumption that the
process is internal and organic--that is, it relies on (in Patrick Durgin's
terms) the "self-evidence" model over and above a poetics of
"self-reflectiveness," whether on the level of "craft" or "process."  Maybe
we need to make a distinction, however, between "organic" and
"essentialized."

Honestly, I don't believe the poet is qualified to determine whether his or
her work is "genuine."  You just can't worry about this, at least not on the
level of micro-refinement of the linguistic text that attends workshopping
or even individual composition.  What makes a form of writing commodified is
not so much what it says or what it looks like as how it is packaged (that
is, with other work by other people) and distributed, which is an editorial
and industrial problem rather than an authorial one.  Not that this is
something that can't be addressed in a workshop, but I think that if the
author tries, as a part of the process of writing, to second-guess the
forces that make work either "real" or "fake," it just results in tepid or
stiff poetry.

If I had one piece of solid advice for someone in a workshop, it would
probably be to try to write work that you feel somehow tests the limits of
what a workshop can do or is intended to do.  But then I'd probably be a
very annoying person to have in a workshop.

A few sonnet-based texts that spring immediately to mind:

* Ted Berrigan, _The Sonnets_ [Burroughs-derived cut-up method]
* Bernadette Mayer, _Sonnets_ [this and Berrigan's book are pretty much the
most influential sonneteering models in the experimental canon]
* Ron Padgett, "Nothing in that Drawer" from _Great Balls of Fire_ [consists
of the title repeated 14 times]
* John Ashbery, _Shadow Train_ [12-line stanza cycle]
* Stephen Ratcliffe, _Idea's Mirror_ [not in recognizable sonnet form, but
inspired by Michael Drayton's cycle--visually the most strikingly
experimental of all these I've mentioned]
* Aaron Shurin, _Involuntary Lyrics_ [as I recall, the last word in each
line of each poem is the same as the last word in each corresponding line of
Shakespeare's Sonnets]
* Juliana Spahr, "Power Sonnets" [Self-publish or Perish chapbook--my
favorite one consists of phrases from a Rolling Stone interview with Korn]
* me, "The Dopes" [Self-publish or Perish chapbook--a cycle of 20 14-line
poems, in a pseudo-elevated register, about things like oiled wooden
squirrels, discarded raisins, and Maoists--slips into pentameter at times,
even]

also, Mike Magee has been doing some killer semi-aphasic hip-hoppy
treatments of poems by George Herbert, et al., frequently in sonnet form

I think I am going to have my workshop students (in class) write poems that
are (indignant usually) letter poems, usually to entities other than real
persons they know (I don't want sentiomental letters to Mom...  I want
daclarations of love to the plumber, angry complaints to Allen Greenspan
blaming him for your digestive difficulties, letters to the post office
complaining about the taste of the adhesive in stamps, etc)  The idea is
probably not to stick to the point but to digresss into random obsevations
the recipient of such a letter wouldn't care about.  Below are a few I
dashed off...   Does anyone else have any that I could use (or just be
amused by)?  Published poems in this genre also interest me but I don't have
time to unnt them down probably before next week as I don't have access to
an academic library and the public library would probably get it from a
branch if it's obscure...  Also, I was thinking of this more as a challenge
to write a quick poem in 5 - 10 minuttes because I think that's what I will
ask the particpants of my workshop to do.




Dear Cape Cod Potato Chip Company,

while it is true that your kettle-cooked chips are the best on the market,
they make me sad, and I am writing to tell you that I never buy anything
which is even in the same aisle as your chips
I know the windmill on the package is supposed to make me imagine
dazzling beaches, picturesque lighthouses, darling windmills –
all painted by inferior watercolorists from Eastham
but it only reminds me that I broke up with my last lover in Hyannis
(and when I say last I mean last ever, for there will never be another)
not that you could find a windmill there

we almost died as the car went out of control on the rotary on Route 6,
both of us screaming obscenities in shrill voices,
our long hair streaming out opposite windows
(yes I know it’s impossible)
finally we got stuck going round and round
with a Cape Cod Potato Chip truck honking at us
to go somewhere
anywhere
“got a problem, girls?,”
the driver yelled
“I can recommend my shrink”
and our Dark Russet Extra Intense Crunchy Flavor

Dear Agent Goon (CIA),

Please note that I am not involved in any communist, terrorist, or fascist
activity.
It was because of my anxiety that the needle jumped when you asked me that
on my last polygraph
I had forgotten my breakfast cereal, which can make a person anxious
that and my cat had a hairball
so please remove the record from my record
I have been a good patriotic employee all my life
I wouldn’t want this to ruin it
just because I skipped breakfast and the cat and also my wife kept me up
extra long
doing the marital duty thing
you’ll note that I’ve always been faithful
which reduces the risk that an enemy agent could blackmail me
she wanted to know how I justified working for you
and I pointed to the house around us, the two sleeping children, the car in
the garage
the government’s been good to me
so no way would I be involved in communist terrorist or fascist
organizations,
so please throw the record of yesterday’s polygraph in the office shredder.
If not, and you know how I’d hate to even mention people’s personal lives at
work
what with the atmosphere of suspicion
I could tell Agent Shades about your little tryst with the upper class Saudi
boy we interrogated
at the refugee camp in Jelalabad.  Only one night, to be sure,
but they won’t like homosexuality, child sex, and fraternizing with enemy
aliens
all at once....  you don’t know this, but I saved the card he wrote you
“thanks for the feeling of bees in honey” in Classical Arabic
I think I’ll put it in my briefcase this morning,
just in case
I know how to hide things, but it might just slip out
during the security check.
I just thought I’d warn you.
So please tell the boss about my cat’s hairball on the irreplaceable
Middle-Eastern rug
(he’s a soft one for collectibles,
especially the kind you don’t pay import taxes on like other Americans)
and get me off the hook.

Yours Truly,

How about Queneau's "mille million de sonnets" in which he makes up 14 sets
of lines, with the lines in each set intended to be used intechangeabley
(you are supposed to make a random choice) to make a symbolist sonnet.
Amazingly, the sonnets sound as if someone composed them and as if there are
figures of speaech amnd symbols and a theme...  when in fact there is
nothing of the sort in a ny real sense.  He didn't cheat by giving them all
the same symbols or theme either.

Another subeversion of the sonnet cycle is John Hollander's "Powers of
Thirteen" which looks just like a sonnet cycle except that it is made up of
thirteen-line poems with thirteen syllables in each lime.  Hollander's
actual sonnets are also about as far as one can go from the traditional
sonnet meter and stay sonnet-like in a "traditional" way , ie they are in
VERY irregular iambic pentameter, with just enough lines that scan to make
you feel the poems are traditional sonnets.  Often it is dialogue that
interrupts the flow of iambs, but sometimes Hollander just seems to choose
something as un iambic as possible just to subvert the sonnetyness of the
poems.  The topic are also rather unsonnety even though many speak of love,
ie two lovers have a fight over whether it is right or wrong to splat all
over someon's car when committing suicide from the Empire State Building...

Marilyn Hacker is less radical, but her novel in sonnets Love, Death, and
the Changing of the Seasons takes the sonnet sequence to a new level of
expressiveness and detail (in lower case, no rhymes, altered meter).  By
contrast, Vikram Seth's sonnet sequence novel "The Golden Gate" follows the
traditinal form to a t but subverts sonnetary expectations by being about
completely prosaic things such as working for the defense industry or having
a rock band and doing pottery instead...

I dont think so. One needs the "close reading" and the wider, general
discussion. There are usually as many questions as answers; if not more.

It's one way. Your/our/may/their everyone;s mind is flexible: we can opeate
on different levels and benefit/ not benefit/use  som/ none / reject or
embrace or combinations of these.  Of course "cut classes to read the books
and look in obsure corners"  but as long as you can get away and be in a
position to say: well_ that_ was interesing, but I still want to do_ this_
At the end you will still be an individual: any attempt to de-individaulise
(!) you will hopefully leave you the more an individual: but not thus
unreceptive to new ideas. And not neccesarily not interested in cooperative
work but therre is very littleof significance in literature or value
produced that way: or if it is it isnt the main source...

Who cares: dont worry about what other's think: go your own way (given the
receptivity I mentioned) and, well go for it! People respect idependence and
originality of thought...

Language is a word. The coffee, thick and tart like
rain if sex
were kiddie pool, finally finished and in your hands
to warm them
up. In the same direction as synchronicity, a car
outside turns
over as the central air kicks in. It's about that
time.
     "Language is a word" is a sentence. The central
air, black
and sour as if rain carried a violin case down Eryk
Salvaggio's
street, kicks in every window of every abandoned car
turning over
in the steadily unbruising dawn. Your warm hands gaze
longingly
out the window. The kiddie pool, having been open all
night,
finally shuts off on a rush of spastic crenoline jets.
In case
you were wondering, all women are mortal. The time at
the tone
will be.
     "'Language is a word' is a sentence," she writes,
quite
pleased with the cleverness with which she has
subverted the
objecthood of the previous sentence and virtually
uttered a novel
thought. The rain spoke with a slight lisp, revealing
its lower
socio-economic origins; it had been promiscuous in its
youth, and
now, older, had retreated into a well-worn piety that
felt like
cars turning over and bursting into flame. All the sex
in the
house has molded, and must be thrown out. That happens
in these
climes; the children, exhausted after night-swimming
until the
rim of day, slip back into their caskets, sated until
dusk
trickles through the hinges again. In case you were
wondering,
you are now completely out of time. So much space in
there I had
to stand still.

Ted Berrigan: master of the sonnet--impossible to go
back to Shakespeare once you've been lost in "The
Sonnets"

Also, a lot of S. Howe's "Europe of Trusts" feels like
sonnet sequences.

Lots of Jean Valentine's earlier work (look in
"Pilgrims" and the first book--forget the
title...--approaches sonnet form, and the later work
imitates the first part of the sonnet, a turn at then
end, and then--nothing--

but that's all general, isn't it?

Though I am still not sure why the delete key on a computer is so very
different from the spit-licked finger turning the page quickly to the next
work in the literary magazine, or even the reader's hand that casually
drops the entire journal back on the rack in the bookstore, lit unread

Since some posts are going by with blips about experiments, I just
thought I'd mention this. Rosmarie Waldrop has been doing amazing
stuff at the prose / lyric intersection for years, but I'm struck by her
recent work as if for the first time. This, an exerpt from New
American Writing #20:


HOLDERLIN HYBRIDS III: EVENING SUN

1

On a balcony onto the Seekonk stands. And full of thoughts of
winter. My friend. And drunk with red wine I. Think of the power. Of
a single word. Like for example "fact." When I know what matters. Is
between.

*

But how with gnarled hands hold the many and how? The sun and
shadow of Rhode Island? Let alone the earth?

*

Down swoops the hawk. From the sky over Providence. The sky over
my head. Down to the leaves inward curled on the ground. But not
like buds. Yellow. A cat is buried here and the leaves. Swirl up in the
wind.

*

In the hour of the hawk. What is meant by: I think? Or even: I sit
under the clouds in which. Rain gathers weight. I sit in my mother's
shawl which is. Threadbare. In my head I sit. By the river Euphrates.
Strange like water the skies of the dead.

*

And high from the branches of the maple. Like a prelude to snow.
White feathers.

Separate Parts
(Six Memory Pieces)

Martha King

Pivotal Prose Series

On New York's Lower East Side, the 1960s are just beginning. Separate Parts
(Six Memory Pieces) explores a world of committed, vibrant, and insistently
independent artists and writers struggling for freedom from the social
limitations of that time.  Beginning with her own life and that of her
husband, poet/painter Basil King, Martha King doesn't gloss over the
personal and political contradictions of the era; the struggles she
describes are both heroic and deeply flawed. She shows that even on this
rebellious frontier, one doesn't have to look far to find the seeds of
contemporary corporate New York. Nevertheless, Separate Parts celebrates a
world in which many people believed, often at desperate cost, in the power
of art to transform the world.

Yes, I agree, for years now (and I say this unobjectively) staggeringly
beautiful work, taking us in new and unexpected directions. Her work
continues to be by far some of the most comprehensive treatment of
prose/lyric stretches we have. Viva Rosmarie!

has anyone read Mr Waldrop's lovely little trilogy?

and does anyone know how one can get a print copy of
"Garden of Effort" which figures so largely in
Palmer's  "Danish Notebook"?

DEAR SIR.



PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

I got your contact from private search on the
internet. I therefore decided to contact you for
venture below. I am the second son of General
Sanni Abacha, the late Military Head of State of
Nigeria. When my father we alive I used to move
funds, in cash, running into millions of United States
dollars to Brazil, Lebanon and other parts of the
world, for safe keeping on behalf of my father.

However, on the eve of my father’s death in June 8,
1998, he gave me the sum of US$30,000,000.00 (THIRTY
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS)  in cash to move to
Lebanon as usual, but immediately my father died I
had to moved the fund to Holland through a diplomatic
courier service to a security company in Holland.

The funds have been in the security company in Holland
since July 1998. However, because of the many
restrictions placed on my family by the present
Nigerian Government, I simply cannot travel to
Holland to secure the funds from the security company
in Holland. What I now need from you are as follows:-

 1.You should travel to Holland to secure the funds in
 cash on my behalf and deposit it in your bank
 account in your Country.

2.You will be entitled to 30% of the total sum
 involved for your assistance.

3.As soon as you confirm to me your readiness to
travel to Holland, I will send a copy of my Power of
Attorney to the security company in Holland
authorizing them to release the funds to you.
 4.As soon as you have the fund in your custody, I
will give you details of where and which sector you
 will invest my share of the funds into, on my
 country.

 5.Please note that this project is 100% risk free,
 but you must keep it very secret and confidential
because of my personal security.

Please contact me immediately through my e-mail
 address: ibrahimabacha4@yahoo.com
Best regards,

IBRAHIM ABACHA.

Molly,

It has been fairly common practice since Ez exhorted everyone to make it new
to write non-sonnet sonnets. So you might consider looking back even further
than 60. Recently, Bill Knott leaps to mind: check out his many sonnets and
bastardizations of the form scattered throughout his various books.

Knottily,
Brian Clements

I'd like to ask listers to please suggest the most interesting
variations/parodies/appropriations/misuses of sonnet form that you can
think of since 1960 (arbitrary but useful cutoff date).  I'm especially
interested in visual work, and also hope to hear of some variations on the
"sonnet-cycle," but all responses are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

The Blue Tape


I was still married to Beth and heard Kathy read and Kathy came and Beth
moved in with Ed and Bernadette had moved out or moved out then and Beth
and I had been together four and a half years more or less. Kathy and I
began writing each other; she placed me in the position of her father; I
thought she was my soulmate. Ed had a copy of her diary; I pasted the
letters in it. Later I gave it to Tom who passed it on to Chris. I don't
know where it is now. Kathy came one night when Beth left and the next day
and next few days were terrible; we made the tapes - there were more than
one - in the midst of the terror. Emily, who had been my student at
R.I.S.D., filmed the materials on an EIAJ black-and-white Sony deck, I
think 3600. They were filmed at my apartment, which Ed's brother Tom, I
think, had found us, on 16h or 17th street; perhaps it was his.

I had been working in video and writing; Kathy had been writing; I sugges-
ted we do a tape to pay for her coming out from the coast. We got a bit of
advance booking. Everything fell apart between us. She had worked in Times
Square; I suggested we explore sexuality on the tapes and she agreed. I'd
been working on and off in a messy narrative style, which I still do.
There was no editing beyond starting and stopping the camera. At least one
of the other tapes was an inverse of the one we showed.

We pushed things as far as we could. I felt needy. I hated myself.

I remember Kathy being suicidal, accidently locked out of the flat when
Emily and I took a break; she'd wanted to be alone. Neither of us were in
great shape. I forget whether we made the tapes all that day or over a
couple of days. I forget the sequence.

We showed the tapes at St. Mark's and there was dead silence afterward.
Vito was there. I think it was then that Jackson was there as well. Kathy
said You've had your fun, children, now go home. or something to that
effect. People were upset. Jackson said it was a very brave thing you
did. We showed the tape at Yale and everyone laughed. We showed the tape
at R.I.S.D. and everyone cried. At R.I.S.D. we went to an opening and
someone came on to me who had been a student and I wasn't used to that and
she came to the flat on 16th or 17th street and we had a short affair, but
that led to another story. I showed the tape at San Diego, or maybe it was
Cal Arts, or maybe both. I don't remember.

I'd never been able to watch the tape; it was too painful. It still is.
After the California showing, I said I didn't want to show it again, and
Kathy thought that was ok. (We agreed only to show the tape with mutual
consent.) I didn't for years, until it was revived and shown in various
places and I'd moved on and so had she.

I was teaching at Hartford Art School and asked David to take it in for a
grant application; he ran 'the dirty parts' for his students and swore
them to secrecy. One of the students told me, crying hysterically, at the
end of the year.

Kathy thought I was crazy and I thought she was crazy. Sometimes I'd hear
a hello from her later on. We did, back at that time, a complex electronic
piece for WBAI, again about love, control, etc., the usual subjects. It
went well but I don't think it was broadcast, but then I don't know.

I don't know where "The Blue Tape" title came from; I don't think we'd
given it/them titles, but I'm not sure.

What else? I'm glad the tape's out there and being seen again. There was a
recent article on it on the net; I thought most of it was wrong or slanted
but that's to be expected. Every time it comes up, those days come back to
me.

And those days are long gone. Bernadette didn't speak to me again. I was
with her sister for a while. Vito and I stopped speaking. Around 1977 I
moved out of New York and around 1990 I moved back. A lot has happened
since then.

Excuse me, but around the time Ez said "make it new," Bill Williams said
something like the sonnet is a dead form, & I'm not aware of anyone before
Ted Berrigan touching the sonnet in any sort of attempt to breathe life into
it.  Maybe there's someone you (meaning any of you) know of; in which case,
please fill me in.  I think, as Kasey said, the examples that tend to be of
continuing interest to most people on this list would be Berrigan's _The
Sonnets_, published in the 60s, and Mayer's _Sonnets_, published in the late
80s.  Both are great books.  I don't really see the other texts Millie
mentions as being of much impact in this context, whatever their merits--
but again, I'm willing to be filled in.  (And I have heard that Ashbery said
that _Shadow Train_ was not intended as a _sonnet_ sequence-- so whether
that text pertains to this discussion, I don't know).  I might also mention
Anselm Hollo's recent (since circa the mid-90s) sonnets.  Again, despite
their merits which I certainly would argue, I'm not sure of how much they
pertain to the original question....

THE SHIPPING FORECAST

The striking thing about reading these pieces
is that High Rockall and the general synopsis
you find that the area for the next 24 hours is
please. please. when all is said & when all is

there are other considerations like the last Samurai
you know the one that followed all the others like
words?

The striking thing about reading these pieces is
that a new shipping area FitzRoy came into effect
and you find that the area for the next 48 hours is
stop. now. listen to the beginning like site reading
the sight reading when all is increasing or decreas-

there are other explorations like John Rae better than
Man Ray or the road to Antarctica is paved with
Maxwell Davis wouldn't you say?

The striking thing about needing these pieces is
that full details are included in our Marine(s) the
weather services. North or Northwest 4 increasing
5 or 6, becoming cyclonic for a time.

there are other illuminations like the celebrated
Mr Kite celebrating his would you say kite?
or was he really sitting at the quay of the bay?

The striking thing about dreaming these pieces
is that Forties when 4 or 5 occassionally even
Dogger or Fisher or the German Bight needs
occasionally to rest, maybe in Humber, later.

there are other accumulations and if you look
at the city she conquered you will only see
New York lying at her feet. She never made
it into Julliard. Something about the way she
held the cello.

According to Mark DuCharme:
>
> Excuse me, but around the time Ez said "make it new," Bill Williams said
> something like the sonnet is a dead form,

Mark, for what it's worth - and this doesn't really mess w/ you overall
point methinks - The WCW quote is significantly later than the Ez - it's
from his Introduction to _The Wedge_, 1944:

"It isn't what [the poet] *says* that counts as a work of art, it's what
he makes, with such intensity of perception that it lives with an
intrinsic movement of its own to verify its authenticity.  Your attention
is called now and then to some beautiful line or sonnet sequence because
of what is said there.  So be it.  To me all sonnets say the same thing of
no importance.  What does it matter what the line 'says'?"

As Kasey mentioned I've been messing around with the sonnet form lately  -
or more specifically with the rhetoric of the renaissance short lyric as a
kind of ghost-structure, like giving Westminster Abbey to Frank Gehry and
saying, "Could you build me something mad stupid out of this?" or
something like that (!).  But, however I mihgt want to modify Williams'
stipulation here it remains for me one of the more provocative poetics
staments around.

Incidentally, there's a sonnet by John Peale Bishop called "A
Recollection" (ca 1930?) which is a boroque and mythological sex scene
(think "Leda and the Swan" light and fluffy) - and an acrostic, reading
down the left margin as FUCK YOUH ALFA SS. That's "Fuck you, half-ass," to
you and me cuz.

There are some bastards in this world, that's for

has rolled
over also, begins picking something from my back. In
such cases
the body turns on itself, literally "eating" itself to
maintain
the disease state. Hawks circle over the trees.
     I turn my eyes backward in their sockets to watch
the blue
flecks jangle in the dark, which is fortunate enough
to be
everywhere, slicking her hair like oil rolling down
her legs as
the steam of a shower warms morning noisy with patter
frequencies, engaged in absorbtion with change
spilling liquid
like consonance or consience from woodgrain. A good
train of
arias flutter with hummingbird panache chakras
lullaby'd and
spinning lids for thought tall and planes naturalize
citizens
from huddling masses to demographic sandwhiches; in
cases like
this the body literally "eats" itself, Iraq and
Afghanistan in
its mouth dribbling oil down her legs to print her
toes in

motion
with shape, not enough to startle us from our
television pleasure
but more likely to finish shimmying up the gold chain
dangling
from the rapper's artificial contacts.
     They're skinning orphans in the square again,
those bastards
with the money falling from their artillery belts. I
roll over to
pet the cat; Renee has already slept for years, and
watches the
circling hawks with apprehension. We have no
application to
confuse our motion with our shape; opening, we only
display a
prompt in search of a context of software. The disease
state, the
 agent with the hunger reminds us, is the richest and
most
powerful country in the world. We're so lucky!

Hamilton, Richard
MOTHER
NY: Letter Edged in Black Press, 1968
13.5 x 23cm, folded and glued card with a 7 x 9cm (folded size) 7 plate
tipped on folded insert. Hamilton's multiple for the SMS set consists of
a reproduced and appropriated postcard image of a crowded beach at the
UK resort of Whitley Bay (beloved of many Bank Holiday weekends). Verso
the card is designed as if a seaside postcard and carries the message:
"A Richard Hamilton Novelty". The tipped in small booklet enlarges. step
by step, part of the image eventually centring on a family group of two
small children and their mother. The last image is a very enlarged blob
which still retains a sensibility of motherhood much like a Henry Moore
sculpture. A peon to childhood memories. Very fine condition.

Hamilton, Richard.
UNTITLED Poster designed by the artist for the Marcel Duchamp exhibit
'Tate Gallery, London 1970'.

(Hugo, Valentine)
D.A.F. Marquis de Sade
EUGENIE DE FRANVAL
Paris: Les ditions Georges Artigues, 1948
4-tro, 86pp with original wrappers.  Includes 8 dry-point illustrations
by Valentine Hugo.  One of 1,200 copies on  "vlin de Lana". Very good
condition. Hugo's interest in the work of De Sade was typical of the
surrealist's love for the libertine - attracted not only by the erotic
and pornographic tone of the books but also the distain for the family,
anti-clericism and a rejection of bourgeois morality. Scarcer than the
limitation might suggest. Images of the etchings available.

195 uk pounds



Immendorff, Jorg

account of Immendorff's early 60's LIDLl activities and actions. over
120 b/w and colour reproductions of photographs. LIDL (the sound of a
baby's rattle) was the basis for numerous public works, political
protests against the state, campus demonstrations and, astonishingly, an
artists' sports event which included Robert Filliou, Schmit, Ben, Koepke
as active participants and a cycle race to Broodthaer's Eagle museum.
actually we'd be sad to see this book sold but there you have it. very
good although some grubbiness on the covers and the remnant of a fold on
one edge throughout the book.

Germany:  Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 1993
84,5 x 60 cm, offset exhibition poster signed and dated ('93) in silver
by Koons with a very large added drawing of a flower. While drawing the

image.

metal children's game in die cut cardboard box. Typically a playful
multiple by the rejuvenated neo-pop funster. The game is a

Molinier, Pierre.
LA POUPEE.
Unique photo-assemblage. Nd. (c. 1970). 20 x 30cm. (color) cibachrome
photographic print in dual passe-partout; which has been hand-prepared,
painted in white and further embellished by the artist via a series of
vertical razor-cuts and 5/8" pasted-down mantle as border with affixed
'razor blade' etched 'Pierre Molinier'. An exceptional photo-piece cum
object by the Surrealist-affiliated artist. The image is a
characteristic self-portrait as 'doll' (face heavily made up and visible
for a black lace veil, polished nails apparent for matching
semi-transparent gloves). For some 30 years Molinier focused his
attentions upon the fetishistic cultivation and maintenance of his
persona as subject-model in extremis; engaging in gender-bending
projections and mournful transvestitism (in solitude) toward an ideal
image of himself as hermaphrodite. His photo works represent life
documents of the artist as (his own) voyeur. Molinier committed suicide
in 1976. The piece offered herein was, by all appearances, meticulously
prepared and assembled by the artist as a gift. Fine estate.

I apologize to those who have received this three times. I hit a
glitch, but hopefully three times's a charm . . .

Fence Books is delighted to announce the winner of the 2002 Fence
Modern Poets Series.
Judge Ann Lauterbach selected Elizabeth Robinson's Apprehend.
Apprehend will be published as a collaboration between Fence Books,
Apogee Press, and Saturnalia Press in May of 2002.
Fence Books will also publish Anthony McCann's Skywalker Ranch and
Martin Corless-Smith's Nota.

Guidelines and required entry forms for our two contests, the Alberta
Prize and the Fence Modern Poets Series, are now available on the
Fence Books website. http://www.fencebooks.com. Tell your friends!

There were 13 finalists in all. Here they are, in no particular order:

Frayed Escort, by Karen Garthe, of New York City
Apprehend, by Elizabeth Robinson, of Berkeley, CA
The Opening Question, by Prageeta Sharma, of Brooklyn, NY
Quarantine, by Brian Henry, of Athens, GA
Hello, Bee-Thigh Mane, by Travis Nichols, of Northampton, MA
Structure of the Embryonic Rat Brain, by Christopher Janke, of Greenfield, MA
Neighbor Dirt, by Jennifer Kietzman, of Ann Arbor, MI
Skywalker Ranch, by Anthony McCann, of Brooklyn, NY
100 Clews, by Jason Zuzga, of Tucson, AZ
The Breaking Book, by Margo Berdeshevsky, of Paris, France
Backhand: A Calypso in Four Parts, by Zachary Jack, of Afton, TN
Corruption, by Srikanth Reddy, of Madison, WI
Nota, by Martin Corless-Smith, of Boise, ID

About Apprehend, Ann Lauterbach says: "Taking her cues from folktale,
legend, and fable, Elizabeth Robinson has reinvented the 'uses of
enchantment.' Robinson calibrates the motion between fear,
apprehension, and knowledge-comprehension at the crux of human
imagining. She shows, with a minimalist's precision and a logician's
attention to linguistic morphology, how the often bleak agenda of the
real capitulates to the moral restitution of the true; how our need
to tell stories enjambs faith and enlightenment. This is a work of
uncanny persuasion."

About Elizabeth Robinson: "Elizabeth Robinson is the author of In the
Sequence of Falling Things (paradigm press), Bed of Lists and House
Made of Silver (both from Kelsey St.Press), and Harrow (Omnidawn).
Her work appears in The Best American Poetry of 2002.  With Colleen
Lookingbill, she edits EtherDome Press, which publishes two chapbooks
annually by previously unpublished poets. She is one of five editors
of a new magazine, 26."

***This announcement list has recently been updated. Please, if you'd
like to be taken off this list, which relays information
approximately six times a year about Fence Magazine
(http://www.fencemag.com) and Fence Books, just reply with the
subject heading "Remove." I apologize in advance if you've made the
request before and now been added back on . . . this is not an exact
science.

In addition to the modern/postmodern sonnets and sonnet sequences referenced
so far on the Buffalo list, here are a few more I'd like to call to your
attention (while also tooting my own horn a bit):

I certainly see cummings' poem "r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r" as
words and letters hopping around in a sonnet-box (though=20
I can't take credit for the idea). This counts in my mind=20
as a precursor to Berrigan, since his poems are sonnets=20
only in the sense that they refer to sonnets or take the=20
sonnet format (and thematics to some extent) as a given.=20
Millie mentions John Hollander -- his essay "The Poem in=20
the Eye" (from _Vision and Resonance_, ca. 1976) makes a=20
worthwhile claim for a gestalt sense of visible stanzaic=20
form that speaks, I think, to the Berrigan sequence (tho=20
John himself, being a very trad critic (& poet), certainly=20
wouldn't have had Ted in mind!). The argument Hollander at=20
least implies is that any poem that presents you with a=20
blocklike box of text, where the lines (or enough of them=20
to make the point) are about as long as pentameter would=20
require, and where there are something close to fourteen of=20
them, refers to the sonnet and therefore, in regard to its=20
place in the history of visible text forms, IS a sonnet (or=20
a "sonnet" I guess).

There are several examples in early Clark Coolidge, e.g.=20
his poem "by a I" in _Space_. More or less the same idea as=20
cummings' grasshopper, though to a very different effect:=20
in this case there's a sonnet-box where you get the sense=20
that words are occluded, and only the ghost of some former=20
coherence remains. I was convinced at first reading that it=20
was a little joke -- a real Elizabethan sonnet reduced to a=20
handful of pronouns and prepositions -- but now I think the=20
composition is original, because of the way it repeats. I'm=20
quoting from memory but I think it's "by a I of to on no we=20
or" twice, dispersed into a sonnet-box.=20

- Damian

P.S. For what it's worth I have three sonnets in homage=20
to Ted in the latest Ampersand, and a prose recut (quite=20
different) of same in Word/For Word #2. You can link to=20
both from http://www.people.virginia.edu/~djr4r/pomes.html.

Subject:      I HATE SONNETS.

Mike Magee cites WCW's 1944 quote from _The Wedge_:

"It isn't what [the poet] *says* that counts as a work of art, it's what he
makes, with such intensity of perception that it lives with an intrinsic
movement of its own to verify its authenticity.  Your attention is called now
and then to some beautiful line or sonnet sequence because of what is said
there.  So be it.  To me all sonnets say the same thing of no importance.
What does it matter what the line 'says'?"

Believe it or not, this is the first time I've really looked closely at
Williams' statement and the corresponding passage from Bob Grenier's "On
Speech" (_This_ 1, 1971) at the same time:

"Why imitate 'speech'?  Various vehicle that American speech is in the
different mouths of any of us, possessed of particular powers of colloquial
usage, rhythmic pressure, etc., it is only such.  To me, all speeches say the
same thing, or or: why not exaggerate, as Williams did, for our time proclaim
an abhorrence of 'speech' designed as was his castigation of 'the sonnet' to
rid us, as creators of the world, from reiteration of the past dragged on in
formal habit.  I HATE SPEECH."

At the risk of stating the obvious, Grenier's "it is only such" and William's
"So be it" are in direct articulation: both qualifications simultaneously
acknowledge and bracket the question of referential eloquence, admitting that
what someone "says" will often be at least as remarkable as the way in which
it is said, but insisting that this is beside the point of poetry.  In fact,
the reduction of the poetic act to a dichotomous distinction between what is
said and the way it is said, as provocative as some of its applications might
be (say, Jakobson's poetic function), may itself be a missing of the point,
hence the difficulty I've been trying to express in using techniques of close
reading that attach a certain kind of semantic significance to enjambment,
rhyme, etc.

"Not this.  What then?" to quote Ron S.  Well, to start with, going back to
the sonnet, what might be important, for example, would be the shape the poem
makes, not by virtue of its placing specific words spatially in relation to
other words, or its echoing specific sounds with other sounds, and so forth
(though these are obviously things of importance to the poet in the act of
composition, when the poet is writing through a given tradition or set of
readerly expectations, as is often [usually?] the case), since these are
concerns that are automatically old hat as soon as the poem has been written,
since once it's written, it's self-evident that these principles of
construction have been applied, for good or bad, and so what more is there to
say but "there you have it"; but by virtue of its jamming, confusing, or
otherwise interfering with exactly the modes of perception that would
ordinarily be employed in proclaiming "such and such an effect is achieved by
enjambing this line here or rhyming this word there."

If all sonnets and speeches say the same things, then the ways in which they
say those things are going to be generally alike as well, at least in the
sense that they all use the same finite structures of parallelism, emphasis,
intonation, and so on.  It's not that these techniques aren't essential, as
I've just said--in fact they are not only essential but inescapable.  One
cannot help but use traditional forms, which is why they are only interesting
up to a point: the point at which you know how, and then can do it without too
much effort or thought.  Otherwise, it's like interpreting your car's spark
plugs or something: "this electrical impulse comments on that other electrical
impulse's inherent resemblance to an electrical impulse released by that other
spark plug in that other car there."

Mike, I think Bishop's "A Recollection" is a great poem with which to
illustrate some of these points.  I just found the whole poem on the web, so
here it is:

--------

Famously she descended, her red hair
Unbound and bronzed by sea-reflections, caught
Crinkled with sea-pearls. The fine slender taut
Knees that let down her feet upon the air,

Young breasts, slim flanks and golden quarries were
Odder than when the young distraught
Unknown Venetian, painting her portrait, thought
He'd not imagined what he painted there.

And I too commerced with that golden cloud:
Lipped her delicious hands and had my ease
Faring fantastically, perversely proud.

All loveliness demands our courtesies.
Since she was dead I praised her as I could
Silently, among the Barberini bees.

--------

Like Padgett's "Nothing in that Drawer," this is a sonnet that seems at first
to reduce the very idea of a sonnet to a gimmick, a meta-poem or anti-poem
rather than a "real" poem.  In fact, Bishop's might be seen as even more
radically reductive, because it not only directs your attention finally to an
anti-meaning, but it does so after first offering the illusion(?) of semantic
fullness, of familiar eloquence.  What do we do with the surface communication
once we realize that it seems to be just a prop for the acrostic?  Where is
the poem?  There's a short piece on it in a 1999 issue of _The Explicator_ by
some guy who raises a few interesting questions of this type at first, but
then spends the rest of the article going off about some other possible
acrostic modes of significance that he thinks might be operating in the poem,
at which point I tuned out, partly because his argument seemed completely
unconvincing, but even more because even if there were these other coded
structures there, "so be it."  They are "only such."

Anybody can tell what's interesting *qua poem* about this poem.  It's not
what's being said, which is pretty funny, granted; it's not the way it's being
said, which is the oldest grade school trick in the book; it's the questions
it gives rise to about how we should respond to it, or whether we should, or
whether there is anything really to respond to, all of which throws the
original pretty little words about whatever is going on with the "she" of the
poem into a further and further self-embedment of irony and self-cancellation.
 It's not just "where's the poem?"--it's "where is any poem like this that was
ever written?"  That power of "referring" outside of itself to a whole
tradition via the violation of an implicit contract between poet and reader is
what charges the poem.  This and Padgett's poem are obviously limit-cases,
since you can only pull a stunt like this off once, but they are limit-cases,
I think, that throw into relief what the limit is *of* in the first place.

"Why not exaggerate?"

Oh, yes, and--big one, how could I have forgotten--his 1965 "Bond Sonnets"
from _Insect Trust_, which Tom Orange discusses at length in his excellent
_Jacket_ article.  I don't think these are among the poems available on the
new EPC site, are they, Tom? but I would think that they would be essential
for any study of radical sonnetage.

Subject:      Sonnets, John Wheelwright
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

John Wheelwright's _Mirrors of Venus: A Novel in Sonnets_ (1914-1938) is an
early 20th century, fairly bizarre example of an "experimental" sonnet
sequence. It's in his Collected Poems, which I think is still in print from
New Directions. Do people still read him? I don't think much has been
written about his work; maybe Ashbery wrote something in that "other
traditions" book or somewhere else? (There's also a moment in a poem of Bill
Corbett's where Corbett wonders if this was the intersection where
Wheelwright was hit & killed.) Here's "Minus":

MINUS

Forgotten lodestone lumps recall
shifted weight. Each to each
they embrace in a man, when a man confront
one of many youths. He, or some other,
might now have been that stript of joy:
Hungry as lust, immeasurable
all unconceived, all immaterial
immutable, undying and unbounded.

     Our close harmony thought
     resolves to unsaid negative.

Each sonnet is followed by a note: "concious human essence is most conscious
in contemplation of divinity, defined by negatives and understood in
silence."

That's fairly abstract. But it's a strange mix, and some of these sonnets
kind of resemble Denby's--"Parting in Harlem" and "Village Hangover," for
instance. (Both of these poems are marred, though, by a kind of "noble
savage" racism.)

Here's a couple excerpts from Wheelwright's "Argument," which prefaces the
sequence:

The sonnet weds thought form to verse form within a compass little extended
beyond the span of instinctive thought. A sonnet is a figure eight inverted
[here we get an inverted typeset 8, wherein the "head," which is now
pointing downward, is smaller than the "body," which is skyward; the effect,
I'm guessing, being that it's opening upward & outward?]. The "perfect"
sonnet (like the first and tenth numbers of this Sequence) would have one
major and two minor turns. Larger turns develop sequences. As the sonnet
structure conforms inwardly to dialectic reasoning and outwardly to the
Golden Mean, a sonnet sequence should rise to grandeur.

But when by defect of skill the outward form serves as a bed of Procrustes
rather than as a bed of Hymen, any sonnet is discomforting. When, with
habitual knack in versifying or with superstitious shunning of all but
conventional thoughts or notions, a poet comes across with "perfect" sonnet
after "perfect" sonnet for any length of time, a sonnet sequence is a bore.

[This next bit comes from a bit later in the "Argument":]

What may well seem elliptical syntax, logical incoherence, and inequivalence
in the branches of simile were ordered through revisions for more than
twenty years to give the performance such faults as conventional
performances lack. ...

[I like that attention to "faults" ... & it does seem to prefigure Berrigan
& Mayer ...]

Hello Molly and others,

In 1997, I published a book of "Dantean-Dadaistic" sonnets in Finnish
called "=C4=E4ninen" (Lake Onega). Most of the sonnets were compiled =
using
various experimental methods in the spirit of Poetry "Experiments" lists
by Charles Bernstein,  Bernadette Mayer, and others. =20

The work also has a web interface, where you can generate new
syntactical sonnets based on all the words used in the book. This is,
alas, only in Finnish yet.

http://www.leevilehto.net/default.asp?a=3D3&b=3D1=20

You'll find some of the sonnets "translated" into "English" at=20

http://www.leevilehto.net/default.asp?a=3D8&b=3D1=20

I've also experimented with putting these through a text-to-speech
engine - you may listen to some of the results as *.wav files at

http://www.leevilehto.net/default.asp?a=3D8&b=3D1&c=3D1=20

(you'll need Windows Media Player or Real Player).=20

Please also note that the sonnet "John Winston Worm"

http://www.leevilehto.net/default.asp?a=3D8&b=3D1&c=3D0&d=3D0&e=3D0&sonne=
t=3D5

was originally based homophonically on Shakespeare's Sonnet 73, which
may explain the quote from that poem in the final couplet...

I'd like to ask listers to please suggest the most interesting
variations/parodies/appropriations/misuses of sonnet form that you can
think of since 1960 (arbitrary but useful cutoff date).  I'm especially
interested in visual work, and also hope to hear of some variations on
the
"sonnet-cycle," but all responses are greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Notes on the Living Templus of A-Letting-Appear..



Attic black praised the wyrm paideuma
with long courtship and untold consummations

Look!

The templus is furred in dancers
Who in turning
Are furred in dancers
Down to the fractal mesoscale
Where the skin is a boiling
Of beasts, an arcimboldowelt
Of twisting gryllimorphs

An ocean of tiny monsters
Whose skins are monsters too
Synthetic metametazoa
Machinic phyla visiting the human sunset
Bringing offerings of nanomechanical daidala
To the world tomb

But Zo=EB fell through waves of Techne'
All together in the heart beat pulse
Of cesium 133 and rhythmic as
Temporal templus
They are together joined
In the letting-appear as ontotemplus

And yet dyschord shows well there too
For there are fierce countenances
There are figures who fall still and dissolve
In soft explosions of uncoiling film
And transitional moth and marmoset code
Tiny grey flannel men stepping hurriedly=20
From the crash
Those who leap in the theatre of suicide
And are reabsorbed=20
Sacrificial sentences
Avatars of an emoting core
Where suffering is a knotted=20
And painful corridor whose walls wail
Whose frescoes lean out to console one another
Whose statues double over and vomit jewels, babies, machines
Jeweled machine babies
Into the mouths of other statues
Who laugh and grin and stretch their=20
Thousand armed photosynthetic snake-bodies
To the indifferent chthrone of energy

As SOL, the old mad tyrant foreverexploding
Forever-living-dying, forever round, forever nomad
Forever a symbol and system.. but not forever
Or was it a scale without meaning
A scale for meaning's debasement
Was it a lie to last this long unchanged

And yet meaning enough for bodies
To grow warm and groan, pleasured and pained
Risen in the foam white nodes forlorn=20
From ocean dread and new
Womb of beaches threaded unto cultures
From Euglena unto Neptune's echinoderm heart
Black spines reaching like night
Into the playground of hand-tongued masks
Putting putti affright with imaged fouling
Through whatever huge intervals of seeking

And fed to the last mind whose machine
And true of daidala in skills
Erupted in primordia reborn
Terrible physiognomy of data made food
Loosed like the arrow of Babel into
A sky rich with invisible messages
To sink like a capsid in the dying
Of our instant dream tectonic

Pleased hulk of offerings
Wandering no more in the bleak abundance
Hidden now as a memory and string in the queue
In the demiourgos processors of your shattered dream
Nanobiotic Prometheus
Prodigality of silicon coral
Final swarm in our following

They're astonishing.

THE SHIPPING FORECAST IV - SAND & OTHER DOMESTIC DETRITUS

And now at 17:25 there are warnings of gales in German Bight,
Humber Thames and Dover. The general Synopsis at 13:00 leaves
us room to consider the shore. there, the Bay of Skaill it's called. it's
the best preserved site around. uncovered by a storm in the mid 1800s

here? this was where an opinion appeared and this is merely the
shadow it left. This is where some other sound occurred and left both
rooms echoing loudly. and this is can we go for a coffee instead?

High Fair Isle expected North Cromarty 10:20 by 13:00 tomorrow.
Low North Germany 10:05 moving steadily southeast erosion
protecting the site. only from erosion. you see damp-proof courses
over 5,000 years old! foundations and a layer of blue clay just like

people are, well, themselves. who died and made you a judge? trust?
they have read the stuff I sent. bastard. I did ask you to use discretion.
not for publication. I told you my opinion of 'survival'. just listen next

Viking. North Utsire northerly 4 or 5, occasionally 6 at first,
becoming westerly later in North Viking, showers then drizzle,
moderate or they actually built middens right next to the houses,
you see, as though they used it for well, smaller, with sand dunes

what's all that chewing gum there? there. by the letter box. there, it
looks like a heart. who did that? is it one person? and they just leave
it there? that is fantastic. love hearts in gum all over and nobody even

Forties, Cromarty, Forth, Tyne northeasterly 5 or 6, decreasing 3 or 4,
becoming variable later in Cromarty. Showers, moderate or good. Dogger,
Fisher here. you can actually they are all similar, see there? probably was
a local builder at work and built all the beds, dressers, tanks in the
floors

how did they chase them away? you mean the police? how do you mean
with music? what kind of music? They chased them away with Vivaldi?
How? did they aim it at them? Vivaldi? It doesn't make any sense what

this is just a myth, baby. do you have proof that someone came along,
blasted Vivaldi out of, what? Speakers? Where? Never was accepted in
Julliard. She played but she just refused to look at the music they gave
her.

I see wind because it ruffles the trees. I don't see
music. It
burns on the door at night while I'm trying to bury
myself.
     Dreaming of the ruins of her life, she climbs
hand over heel
over blocks and blocks of devastation. The trees here
have been
wrenched into contortions that fling shadows too
gnarled to
breathe in over her face. In the hotel, he drapes a
red silk
scarf over the endtablelamp and waits. Swimming in so
many
contexts is funny or shaped like intrusion; their
bodies slip
through their bodies slipping through nothing solid
but the edge
of the manifest, carefully cut with a pair of scissors
from the
box and scrutinized while the vendor waits. The scarf
stains the
light the same color that ruin would be if he could
dream of the
devastation she sifts through. She finds a human leg.
     Kivunjo is a Bantu language with sixteen gender
classes.
That's free. I could fall into several at once,
releasing tufts
of dust because gender is so seldom used. It wouldn't
hurt. Here
there are two, and our case-markers have dissolved. I
only know
what I'm doing by the traces of these opening and
closing the
door all night. To step over the threshold.
     The vendor is always late; he doesn't enjoy
waiting for her
to go over the contents of the box with the manifest
in hand.
There are other shops along the wide road that sell
narrowness
constricted to bright colors and smooth music. These
he must get
to, before his day's end. He doesn't enjoy watching
her sift
through the box with the manifest in hand.

kasey et al.,

i've not been following this thread, but no the "bond sonnets" are not
on the coolidge EPC author's pages. there are, however, some "lovecraft
sonnets" from roughly the same time (1964-ish) and using (so i gather)
roughly the same random/chance procedures.

bests,
tom orange

p.s. check out "gobi," also in SPACE.

Oh, yes, and--big one, how could I have forgotten--his 1965 "Bond
Sonnets"  from _Insect Trust_, which Tom Orange discusses at length in
his excellent _Jacket_ article.  I don't think these are among the poems
available on the new EPC site, are they, Tom? but I would think that
they would be essential for any study of radical sonnetage.

Hi Bill,

I have been away from my world becasue of money reasons. But in a few short
weeks I should be back on my feet and in good standings with those with
their hands out for money. Donnan and I are fdoing very well despit the
crunch. I*t seems that to make money one has a lot to spend -- clothes,
cars, and crap. But as I say this was expected I just didn't  think that it
would lead to my cut off from my high speed conncetion ... so i am sorry for
not getting back to you earlier. I saw an email that requested a poem for
your journal. I'll send soemthing right away. Do you have anything in
specific youi'd like, like something from the superman poem? Or something
else? Let me know and I'll send it right off. I am happy you are going
online with this and happy to help. I miss you, and the  list, terribly. But
every now and again I can find a way to the net. My new job has banned the
internet so no luck there either.

Best, Geoffrey

Merwin on Political Poetry


It is possible for a poet to assume his gift of articulation as a
responsibility not only to the fates but to his neighbors, and to feel
himself obligated to try to speak for those who are in circumstances
resembling his own, but who are less capable of bearing witness to them.
There are many kinds of dangers involved in any such view of what he owes
himself and his voice. There is, for instance, the danger that his gift
itself, necessarily one of the genuinely private and integral things he
lives for, may be deformed into a mere loudspeaker, losing the singularity
which made it irreplaceable, the candor which made it unreachable and
unpredictable. Most poets whom I have in mind would have considered this the
prime danger. But the other risks have all claimed their victims. Where
injustice prevails (and where does it not?) a poet endowed with the form of
conscience I am speaking about has no choice but to name the wrong as
truthfully as he can, and to try to indicate the claims of justice in terms
of the victims he lives among. The better he does these things the more he
may have to pay for doing them. He may lose his financial security, if he
has any. Or his health, his comfort, the presence of those he loves, his
liberty. Or his life, of course. Worst, he may lose, in the process, the
faith which led him to the decision, and then have to suffer for the
decision just the same.

Put at its simplest, and with its implications laid out all plain and neat,
the decision to speak as clearly and truthfully and fully as possible for
the other human beings a poet finds himself among is a challenge to
obscurantism, silence, and extinction. And the author of such a decision, I
imagine, accepts the inevitability of failure as he accepts the
inevitability of death. He finds a sufficient triumph in the decision
itself, in its deliberate defiance, in the effort which it makes possible,
the risks it impels him to run, and in any clarity which it helps him to
create out of the murk and chaos of experience. In the long run his
testimony will be partial at best. But its limits will have been those of
his condition itself, rooted, as that is, in death; he will have recognized
the enemy. He will not have been another priest of ornaments. He will have
been contending against that which restricted his use and his virtue.

Does anyone have a sense of who is consistently publishing experimental =
work by women?=20
Journals, zines, small presses, online, chapbooks, etc.
Feminist or not but with editorial commitment to new writing by women =
(in the vein of Belladonna, How2...)
though I wonder if one can be not feminist and have an editorial =
commitment to women? this is interesting enough to consider...

names links, any information would be appreciated

Thanks, Bill.  (I just got home a little over an hour ago from another of my
idiotic 30-hour Greyhound bus rides--but it wasn't bad.  I even got in a
couple of hours of sleep.)

Aah, Andrews wuz only there because of visual poetry's newly-won
acadominance.  An', anyway, where wuz Billy Collins?  (But I did enjoy
meeting Bruce.)

Similar event scheduled for 7 PM, 15 November that I hope very much also to
be at.  Place: New York Center For Book Arts, 28 West 27th Street, 3rd
Floor.

Thanks

A thanks from here, too.  It's not run EXACTLY as *I* woulda run it all the
time but I am grateful it continues to be here.  It does more good things
for poetry than any other arts list I know about.

Calamity knocks on the door to sell you cake.
What hand bursts through your chest to hand you a name?
What shard is searing in your mind?
What tooth gleams in smoke?
What tactless whelp is gnawing at your skull?
How do you keep the peach from spoiling?
How does night protect the gnat?
Why is that car on fire?
Which clock shivers in your spine?
What new species shrieks over the wind?
What kind of claw evolves within the heart?
Who runs laughing into traffic?
What hapless grip restrains the storm?
What gives your pulse its plainsong?
What returns?
Who tells the wind to fuck itself?
Who throws a nest on the ground?
Which mirror works better than the others?
What good is the rest of your life?
What piece of skin did you give away?
Who shattered silence with a song?
Who broke the statue that you loved?
What kind of cage do you prefer?
What glimmers in the overripe eye?
What wraps itself around your face?
What makes your pupils dilate?
What is that sudden scent?
Who is standing right behind you?
What does that sign mean?
What insect=92s buzzing at the curb?
What color is the sky?
What are you wearing on your feet?
How did you feel this morning?
How do you ever feel?
What does Calamity smell like?
What word do you hear next?
Do you buy the cake?
Is it your cake?
Do you eat it?

Yes.  But what Patrick is talking about (or Merwin is) is the question
really of being, of moral force: if that is lacking in a poet he is no poet
he is not a person. It isnt of course the sole perogative of "The Poet", but
poetry is a kind of language that searches for truth and I dont think you
(one) can look into or at or with the truth of art without being faithfull
to something primal in us all: the social truth...While we are private
beings we are always social beings...I cant of course prove these things but
I see that a poet "dices with death" (or life) if he/she evades external and
other political questions. In this line I feel that Nick Piombino's
reversion to something vague about "bullying" is not good enough: I can
understand his wariness of becoming a "trumpet". As to others:  I think that
some of the prominent literary people including some of the Langpos on this
site who supported the attack against Afghanistan and oter political events
for dubious reasons have shown that they do not understand this wisdom of W
S Merwin and maybe of Emerson and others (Bertrand Russell) and are "hiding
their heads" in obscurities of language - often of gobbldy gook - while
people die: while democracy suffers everywhere, where suffering increases,
barbarism grows inside the houses of the rich.  Richard Taylor.

Whether or not Saddam is the butcher the US and its allies portray him as, I
don't know.  I do know that US propaganda campaigns routinely demonize world
leaders they are about to assassinate or depose -- witness, for example, the
slanted reporting by US media sources on Chavez in Venezuela.  But what I do
know is that the continuing 'sanctions' being enforced on Iraq by the US and
its allies has cost, and are continuing to cost the lives of hundreds of
thousands of Iraqi children.  This fact is not in dispute.  Consider, for
example, the following exchange:

In an interview with Leslie Stahl of CBS on May 11, 1996, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeline Albright was asked whether the over half a million children
killed by the sanctions were "worth it." Her response was: "Itâ€™s a hard
choice, but I think, we, think, itâ€™s worth it."

The question is, worth it for whom?  And now the US and it allies have
racheted up the hate propaganda as an apparent prelude for a military
assault
on Iraq.  By accusing Saddam of unspeakable acts, the US and it allies are
prepared to unleash their own unspeakable acts on the Iraqis.  The irony of
this is not lost on everyone, especially those who realize that the US and
it
allies don't give a rat's ass about unspeakable acts, as their support for
various perpetrators of unspeakable acts around the world attests to.  What
the US and its allies are interested in, are political and --most
importantly
-- economic hegemony, especially the economic hegemony of oil.  While the
continental US contains only 3% of the world's known oil reserves, the
Global
US has a much greater share, and evidently wants much more.  It's important
to understand that there is no loss of life that is too great in adding to
that share.  What's a few million more dead Iraqi children compared to the
riches that accrue from the control of the production and pricing of the oil
reserves in the Middle East?  What is a democratic government in Venezuela,
et al., compared to control of their oil reserves?  Perhaps one should
reflect on these points before sending out mindless propaganda designed to
justify once again the seemingly endless war on the innocents of the world.

Planted in the eye, sleep seeds grow sleep trees. At
parties,
feigning a look of intense boredom. As a defense
mechanism,
trains in the distance all day long run right behind
the store;
watch them slip past with tags on their sides. The
hands in the
head that scoop up language meat.
     Tags on their sides: the names balooning out to
cartoon
cities. Thank you for expressing an interest in my
work; it's
made of you, and turns slickly in the light, wishing
it were
matte because matte swallows things. The second
morning of autumn
tightly wound in the bowels where death thins out and
scrapes an
entire retro trend out of molehills never festered
enough to boil
over upon. Out, the sign intones. A sex crawls back
onto the
shore and spills flecks of gold iris between you.
     Sleep seeds grow sleep trees, when planted in the
eye and
watered by smarting winds. This most inhospitable
region boasts
five intensive care units and all the latest
communicative
technological advances. Please take your hand off my
knee. I
caught their intranet and now take garlic for its
natural
antibiotic properties. The trains go by. Like days
almost, except
the trains always arrive somewhere; walking from here
to the
butcher's thumb on your scale.

Jane, I think it's fair to say that I consistently publish experimental
work by women in COMBO.  Of the top of my head COMBOs contributors over 11
issues have included Jena Osman, Harryette Mullen, Jessica Chiu, Summi
Kaipa, Mytili Jagannathan, Alice Notley, Lisa Lubasch, Ange Mlinko,
Prageeta Sharma, Heather Fuller, Carla Harryman, Jen Hofer, Kristen
Gallagher, Kristin Prevallet, Laura Elrick (I'm no doubt forgetting some
great ones...)  It's feminist insofar as its committed to radical notions
of equality and identity as manifested in poetry.

[I write these =93meditations=94 from time to time in an attempt to stay=20
sane.  If you find them tedious, apply the magic of =93delete.=94  If you=
 want=20
to share them with others, feel free to do so.]

Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies - 4

It=92s rare to be conscious of impending doom, to know that we live in a=20
moment when time is running out, as if we=92re all condemned prisoners=20
waiting for our last dawn.  How pleasant life is, even though soon our=20
sweet peaceable world will come to an end, and we will be plunged into=20
horror.  Now, in this pause before the storm, all we can do is scratch our=
=20
heads and wonder: what the hell is going on?  Why do we face such grief?

Bush is dead set on =93regime change=94 in Iraq, and he is pummeling the=20
American public and world leaders to follow his scheme.  Saddam Hussein,=20
despicable tyrant that he is, poses little threat to anyone, according to=20
most military experts, and, despite unfounded allegations, he does not even=
=20
seem to have had anything to do with the criminal devastation of 9/11.  He=
=20
didn=92t seem to pose much of a threat even in Bush=92s eyes, despite his=
 being=20
strung along the =93axis of evil=94 -- at least not until Enron and=
 Halliburton=20
began to unravel.  Yet the destruction of Saddam Hussein has become an=20
obsession.  During hearings, a Senator asked Secretary of Defense Donald=20
Rumsfeld what America would do if Hussein made every concession demanded of=
=20
him, and the folksy Secretary could only sputter, unable even to imagine=20
diplomatic success.  Clearly, no matter what Saddam Hussein says or does,=20
the Bush administration seems determined to go to war, and ordinary Iraqis=
=20
and Americans -- indeed, the entire world -- are condemned to watch (and=20
pay the consequences) while the juggernaut rolls on.

Now, I assume that the administration is not stupid (despite Bush=92s famous=
=20
denseness).  I assume that it does not believe its own lies (although it=20
may very well be blinded by arrogance).  Certainly, we can ignore all the=20
inflated talk about democracy and principles and morality.  No, we can=20
dispense with platitudes and propaganda.

So, if they really know that the sudden alarm over Iraq is a ploy, then=20
what is their game, really?  Of course, the obvious -- oil -- comes to=20
mind, just as natural gas and pipeline routes make Afghanistan and Central=
=20
Asia far more interesting to the administration beyond the=20
Taliban.  Perhaps no one recalls how, before the attacks, the Taliban were=
=20
ignored, despite their oppression of women and desecration of ancient=20
monuments; they were even courted for pipelines and praised for their=20
Draconian programs to uproot heroin poppy fields.  Distracting the American=
=20
public from the messiness of crony capitalism or engineering economic=20
recovery with a good war -- yes, these too seem like plausible=20
motives.  But, still, if we assume that the administration is not stupid,=20
these reasons are not adequate, at least not for the great risks and costs=
=20
of war.

I would like to suggest the real reason we are about to be plunged into=20
war: WORLD DOMINATION.  No, this is not the plot of a superhero comic book;=
=20
this is for real.  Time really is running out, according to the Bush=20
administration=92s way of thinking -- but not on Saddam Hussein=92s secret=
=20
weapons.  The real target is Europe, uniting as never before and=20
increasingly becoming an economic rival; the real target is Russia, still=20
weak but not for long; the real target is China, growing at a fantastic=20
pace and a potential military rival; and let=92s not forget Japan, always an=
=20
economic threat, particularly in collaboration with the rest of Asia,=20
despite its recent faltering.  All of these =93threats=94 are either weak or=
=20
nascent.  So Bush and Company must strike while the iron is hot, while=20
Americans are frightened enough to allow civil liberties to be junked and=20
jingoism to sound like self-defense.  If U.S. military and business=20
interests can maintain and even expand their control of Middle East oil=20
production, they have Europe and Japan by the balls, and much of the rest=20
of the world, as well.

Keep in mind the recent policy declarations: the U.S. will strike first,=20
even with nuclear weapons, against any country it deems a threat, with or=20
without the consent of the international community; no country will be=20
allowed to build up its military to rival the U.S.; no international=20
commitments, from environmental treaties to United Nations=92 votes to=20
international courts, will encumber the exercise of imperial power;=20
=93nonproliferation=94 is now =93counter-proliferation=94; and on and on. =
 In the=20
eyes of any reasonable person, the United States has become far more of a=20
rogue state, dangerously flashing weapons of mass destruction, than any=20
other country.  Meanwhile, the =93war on terrorism=94 has become a cover for=
 a=20
never-ending war to maintain imperial control.  Americans are being=20
steamrolled into war and our democratic traditions are being twisted to the=
=20
satisfaction of reactionary saviors of =93our way of life,=94 all through=
 the=20
manipulation of very real fears of terrorist violence.

There are those who object that an invasion of Iraq might be a quagmire or=
=20
that the whole Arab and Islamic world might erupt into chaos that will=20
threaten even U.S. allies.  Of course, the Bush administration hopes to=20
achieve its goals quickly and smoothly.  That would be ideal, in their=20
book, and they believe they can get away with it; but their basic response=
=20
is =93So what?=94  I suspect that the arch reactionaries in the=
 administration=20
might even welcome chaos, since it will enable them more easily to cow the=
=20
Saudi and other client regimes.  After all, does it matter if the Hashemite=
=20
dynasty is overthrown in Jordan?  The administration and its supporters=20
might even cheer the imposition in the region of =93democracy=94 in the form=
 of=20
more pliable American clients; and they would certainly turn a blind eye to=
=20
the =93transfer=94 and decimation of the Palestinian people by Ariel Sharon=
=20
done under cover of war.

To sensible, mainstream leaders, such calculations are almost the ravings=20
of lunatics.  During the period of d=E9tente during the Cold War, Soviet=20
leaders analyzed that there was a split in the American elite between the=20
=93rational=94 and the =93irrational=94 bourgeoisie, and that the =93rationa=
l=94 forces=20
needed to be supported by the people to prevent disaster.  The =93rational=
=94=20
folks were willing to accept peaceful rivalry with the alternative economic=
=20
system, while the =93irrational=94 elements were so motivated by their will=
 to=20
power and by ideology that they would inflame militarism and embark on=20
dangerous schemes that could threaten world peace.  The Soviet Union=20
collapsed of its own collective mistakes -- but the analysis, in this=20
different context, may still hold some water.  The New York Times and other=
=20
elite forces, even conservative Republicans, may be considered =93rational=
=94=20
because they feel that U.S. preeminence can be protected without such=20
drastic actions, that the Bush-Cheney crowd is too willing to take too many=
=20
chances, too itchy to play with fire.  Of course, most Americans do not=20
even believe we should be in the game of world domination in the first=
 place.

At the very least, we should be clear about what is really at stake -- and=
=20
the danger posed by Saddam Hussein is the least of our problems.

People interested in this subject should check out a new anthology called
American Women Poets in the 21st Century. (I know the title sounds, well,
premature.) This anthology is organized in an interesting way. It features 10
poets from various camps along with a poetics statement by each and a
critical essay on each one. It was edited by Juliana Spahr and Claudia
Rankine.

BOBBIE LOUISE HAWKINS
NEW One-Woman Show
LIFE AS WE KNOW IT
Joe's Pub
425 Lafayette St.
New York City
Monday, October 14, 2002
Performance will be at 9:30 pm
Tickets $10 at the door.
Information 212-539-8778

Ms. Hawkins has written fifteen books and is noted for "a poignant thread of
cosmic humor" in her work onstage and on the page. Past performances at
venues as diverse as the Greek Theater's BREAD AND ROSES in Berkeley, the
Quiet Knight in Chicago, the Vancouver Folk Festival in Canada, The Great
American Music Hall in San Francisco, One World Poetry Festival in
Amsterdam, the Canterbury Festival in England, and in New York City at the
Joseph Papp Theater, Bottom Line and Folk City were acclaimed by critics.

"Talent, integrity and humor, Bobbie Louise Hawkins is a poet and
storyteller of the first order; each of her performances here (Live at the
Great American Music Hall, Rounder Records) reveals a different aspect of
her gift for poetic diction and her unerring ear."
ROLLING STONE

"Her ear is exact- the dialogue is sharp as splinters, as devastating and
ironic as any dialogue set down by Raymond Carver or Ann Beattie."
TORONTO GLOBE & MAIL

"Hawkins is keenly aware of the complicated vastness of even just one little
human universe. Her sentences do not meet that universe head on but at a
'slight angle'. Hawkins' writing participates in a tradition of American
Modernism in prose that sometimes achieves an almost hallucinatory
precision. A thoughtful artist's eye informs the writing."
THE VAJRADHATU SUN

"She excels at the short take, the oblique view, and the sort of incident
that allows the storyteller leeway to expand, change and alter the
fundamental nugget of actuality. Her curious, witty and occasionally
militant slants make her writing unclassifiable but altogether beguiling."
L.A. TIMES BOOK REVIEW

"Hawkins moves with apparent ease from tale to tale, suffusing each with
irony, anger or love as the occasion demands. Pieces of varying length are
juxtaposed and, once fit together, the life of a woman emerges."
PUBLISHERS WEEKLY

"Miss Hawkins is a superb impressionist as well as a salty prose writer of
American miniatures, artful distillations of our humor and humanity."
NEW YORK TIMES

Hello Debbie,
It was good to hear from you, and I thought this announcement might interest
you, also.
I wish I could just stay in the city a few days and go to all these great
readings.
Things have been hectic, though--my husband was in the hospital during the
weekend.  He's OK now, but we're not entirely settled down, and I have a ms
I'm trying to complete.   Other than teaching my workshop on Wednesday, I'm
not sure whether I can come in again for the Glueck evening.
Hope I can make it, and I'll let you know.
Best,
Charlotte

Feminist work, and work by women, seems quite popular, in fact.

I don't know if I'd go that far -- plenty of people don't=20

else. You build a cabinet or a house or knit a sweater or=20
write a computer program, and insofar as these activities=20
have a moral dimension it's a matter of mindful intention:=20
let this house stand firm and be a shelter and a place of=20
joy, etc. Of course the analogy of poet to carpenter is=20
flawed, since you could always swing your poem around and=20
aim it at a despot or whatever -- language is not neutral=20
like planks and nails -- but then what Kenneth Koch called=20
"poetry language" is not the same as political language, or=20
language with a propositional intent, at all. If Merwin was=20
saying -- I can't quite suss this out, and maybe he was=20
being deliberately ambiguous -- if he was saying that the =20
moral prerogative of the poet in times of crisis is to=20
speak out, not in poems, but in some kind of public way,=20
and that the poet should do this because he can be more=20
rhetorically effective than others, well fine. But=20
I think I'd approach it the other way round: you're a human=20
being, you have a moral impulse, how do you express it?=20
Speak out if it's given to you to do that -- think of Mario=20
Savio, no poet but a born orator. March in a parade; do a=20
sit-in; get arrested -- the first impulse of people with a=20
sense of life-as-theater. Turn Poetics into a political=20
forum -- that ain't nothing, in fact it's remarkable that=20
this list can sustain political discussion to the extent it=20
does. Or who knows, write poems with the mindful intention=20
of doing good work in both senses of the word. I don't=20
think that's the same as fiddling while Rome burns.

nothing. the apocalypse is upon us. if not now, when. the president orders
the death of everyone. we live in constant fear for our lives. we tremble
in the neighborood of enormous machines 'of mass destruction.' we learn
the new language. we learn that brutality comes out of nowhere and returns
to nowhere. we who are about to die. only violence will stop violence.
these beasts understand that. these beasts bide their time. we bide our
time. everyone is waiting.

the stupid president wants to kill with his arms and hands. his aides
bring him one of us. the stupid president strangles him. i will write my
last words. it does not matter if it is him or an other or many others or
everyone. violence breeds violence. these men and women want it. they want
nothing. they want nothing at all.

Yes, 20 years already that he took off. For serious Gould fans (some
Frenchhelpful, but there's enough music) there is a series of
broadcasts on France Culture to mark the occasion. Go to:

Occipital migraines are caused by overly placid water
intake.
Wafers, miming a skin with breezes plying dance from
its surface,
can blend demurely with the whitened tongue. Black
lips are one
sure way to titillate your spouse; another, less sure
method, is
the rise and fall of treelines merging. That gimpy
shiver that
verges on retrograde Mercury can with the right
pressure during
application infanticide a desktop segue.
     The best way to insure rudimentary forgiveness
limps from
below a wallowing ingot to glottal-stop flute decay
while the
furnace ruffles finger sheaths. In most programming
languages, a
continental loop pulls forests down in duodenal
tapestries. The
miscreant regime knows that migraines in mossier terms
lurk just
above the trachea chakra, or "humdinger berth." This
is due to
the overwhelming instinctual mothering tongue's
gondola fetters
that dither transparent gifs apart from reading
aneurysms. It
doesn't mean squat. Even in a hunker, cumulus moot
troth thinks
too vastly of savage love. Better to kibbutz in
nibbles of
oleander when several veer one's way.
     Think, migraines are life's way of adding texture
to one's
dormancy! The occipital phone call unanswered gives to

invigoration rogue hues that blunt a daylong funk.

Over here  when it was Bach's centenary  I taped a lot of he day and part of
it is about 90 minutes of Glenn Gould "The Well Temperd Polymath" and I have
it playing in my car wwith Gould talking aboout bach and his
earlyexperiences and his views of music: I dont understnad exactly what he
ways about bach but I like hearing him talk and his comments: actually my
father had  the well tmepered Clavier by Gould ...one of the first LPs he
got when he got a stereo in the late 60s...but the thing of Gould I play
over  all the time. I listen to nothing else in the car (an old Holden I
bought for about US $450.00 and I took 18 months to pay it off). I believe
there was afilm about him fairly recently? I 'd like to get the video if
there was.

I enjoyed this.      Richard Taylor.

The current issue of Chain, the dialogue issue, is now available in
bookstores. In an effort to raise funds, Chain has also made this complete
issue available online. It also includes the complete text of the discussion
by Barrett Watten and myself that took place shortly after the WTC attacks
of 9/11 here on the poetics list. We each also added an update written
earlier this year. I hope you will all read the online edition or obtain the
printed edition (available at the St. Mark's Bookstore here in Manhattan,
and "at your newstands everywhere.") This issue contains work by many
writers familiar to readers of the poetics list including Bruce Andrews (in
a dialogue with Alani Apio, Joe Amato, Guy Beining, Tom Devaney and Edwin
Torres, Rachel Blau Duplessis, Patrick Durgin and Jen Hofer, Craig Dworkin
and Alessandra Santos, Drew Gardner, Lisa Jarnot, John Kinsella and McKenzie
Wark, Mark McMorris, Bob Perelman and Francie Shaw, Mark Rudman,James
Sherry, Cecilia Vicuna, Mac Wellman and many, many others. The online issue
is located at http://www.temple.edu/chain/9_index.htm

If you've enjoyed Richard Taylor's recent swipes at my political oratory
here on the poetics list, you will no doubt get a kick out of watching a
truly adept political discussant flay me alive in this issue of Chain. Let
me know what you think. In any case I hope you will consider subscribing to
Chain and obtaining some, if not all, of the previous issues which are well
worth the price of $12. Check out Ron Silliman's recent blogs online at
http://ronsilliman.blogspot.com (mentioned recently here on the list) for a
recent dialgue with Juliana Spahr about this issue.

PLEASE NOTE THAT RENEE GLADMAN'S WORKSHOP WILL NOW COMMENCE ON OCTOBER 19TH
AND NOT OCTOBER 12TH AS PREVIOUSLY ADVERTISED.

THANK YOU!

***

WORKSHOP - RENEE GLADMAN
SATURDAYS AT 12 pm: 10 sessions, beginning October 19th
Gladman describes her workshop: "In this class we will write toward the
middle, that terrain between poetry and fiction where the shape and tone of
the line or sentence is as much an idea about narrative as are the notions
of time, place, and character. Through a series of in-class writing
exercises and discussions the class will imagine and test out those
perspectives of storytelling that work against conventional assumptions of
linear progression, authentic voice, and resolution."

Renee Gladman is the author of Juice (Kelsey St. Press) and two chapbooks,
Arlem (Idiom Press) and Not Right Now (Second Story Books). Former editor of
Clamour, she is currently editor of the chapbook imprint Leroy.

***

The workshop fee is $300, which includes tuition for classes and an
"individual" membership in the Poetry Project for one year. Reservations are
required due to limited class space and payment must be received in advance.
Please send payment and reservations (include your address, phone number and
email) to: The Poetry Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 E. 10th St., NY, NY

Well, I went to this site, and I found the article by RAOUL VANEIGEM, which
consists of some really ludicrous remarks attributed to Tony Blair.  Since
I'm not familiar with Vaneigem, I don't know if this is a spoof, although it
certainly seems like one, although there is no overt indication.  So what
exactly is brilliant, the selection of quotes, the spoof, or are we -- as
hard to believe as it may be, intended to take this tripe seriously?  Please
respond, as serious people want to know....

from texturl, my blog (http://brandonbarr.com/texturl/):
---
/culture jam/
Brian Kim Stefans has produced a great piece of cultural criticism that is
ostensibly presented as a New York Times online story. "Blair Presents
Dossier on Iraq's Biological Weapons", by RAOUL VANEIGEM
(http://www.arras.net/blair_presents_dossier.htm), uses graphical elements
and link structures from the original page
(http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/24/international/24CND-BRIT.html) , but
radically alters the text after the first paragraph. In addition, it make
subtler changes to the marginalia--changes that are clearer once the two
pages are viewed side to side.

Very well done.
---

I particularly liked the alterations to the marginalia of the page--the
adjustment of link titles and photo captions.  The quotations are from Raoul
Vaneigem's "The Revolution of Everyday Life."

Every once in a while one's ignorance catches up with one, and the resulting
embarassment, while brief, is somewhat acute.  I didn't recognize Vaneigem's
name, but I should have.  So I've been had, and by myself.  Reading a few of
Vaneigem's quotes, such as: "Ideally a book would have no order to it, and
the reader would have to discover his own." brings the whole matter into view
and I see Ron's point....

still, it's less cultural criticism than a wink to those who get the
Vaneigem/situ reference, which for your average reader is pretty much
opaque in any case. it's like 'la dialectique peut-elle casser des
briques' -- useless decadence of detournement. a good laugh before the
world ends.

Raoul Vaneigem, the man who wrote The revolution of Everyday Life was I
believe either part of, or a precursor to, the Lettrist movement in France
that eventually became the group commonly known as the Situationists.  They
have an rather uncertain relationship to, yet definitely played a part in,
events in especially the Paris "Commune" of May 1968.  Contemporary pre-post
revolutionary councils of aesthetics seem to have developed much of their
sophiology from this group, as for example, Hakim Bey's concept of TAZ
(Temporary Autonomous Zones) - nomadic manifestations of temporary living
systems that keep on moving.  Unfortunately,
corporate America has cashed in on nomadism as well - where are all the Big
Boys located, exactly?  All we have is some statistical knowledge of slave
labor in Indonesia related to, say, Nike, along with a gigantic virtual Nike
sneaker hovering over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, about to do You Know
What.  So you'd better buy the fucking sneaker.
The NYT Blair website in question is rather like what a group called the Yes
Men recently did - made a mock WTO site (don't have the address on hand -
can anybody help?), announced on it that the WTO was closing temporarily and
reopening as an organization that would HELP the world's poor and,
surprisingly, even to them, were invited to speak at business club lunches
around the world, with regard to how the world's businessmen and accountants
could help.
Further efforts along these lines, to clarify issues from a completely
different angle, using means that are already establishment-approved could
actually be a watershed.  As one's in essence already spoken for in the
current (or nearly any) political clime, what's the rub with speaking for
someone else?  It's propaganda, to be sure, but what these days isn't?

take another responsibility
rich, another baby protested
trying, she turns around
                        without sewing shut my pond
this joke wore a little beak
the sound called off the unpacking
(oily front clapped radiant)
                        pride hurts ahead of time
a little bit could be anything, tourists
still loved my shadow - a balm my hair contained
pearls pulled apart at every corner

An indication sported so many obligations
say what you will about Virginia, her only buttons are
on her shirt
                circumstance has the floor
"has the floor, sir - stand down,

this vapor is in the last place digested (though sports,

Small Press Traffic presents
Friday, September 27, 2002 at 7:30 pm
Brandon Downing & Mark DuCharme

Writer of poetry, prose, and mutant places in between, Brandon Downing returns
to San Francisco, a city he illuminated in the 1990s as a major and generous
literary impresario, co-founder of the small press bookshop Blue Books and the
literary journal 6,500. His witty and aching poetry collection The Shirt
Weapon appeared earlier this year from Germ Monographs. "Oh plural Plymouth
your wisdom with cherry lights low/Princes of makeover pillows & jets of
everyone here know:/The candy is on trial!" Downing currently lives in New
York City; his recent work will appear in the Owl Press anthology, Evidence of
the Paranormal.

Poet, prose poet, and critic Mark DuCharme visits us from his home in Boulder
to read from his debut collection Cosmopolitan Tremble, just out from Ohio?s
Pavement Saw Press. "I would have gotten banished from the Eighth Grade for
such care,/Unbaring causes in the demented stairwell/A grace to be born & end
walking in air." As Cole Swenson says, "It?s a brainy engagement with the real
world expanded by the forces of language --". DuCharme?s critical work
includes "Orpheus in the Echo Chamber: Jack Spicer?s Poetics of Community".
Since 1998 he has co-directed the Left Hand Reading Series in Boulder.

All events are $5-10, sliding scale, unless otherwise noted. Our events are
free to SPT members, and CCAC faculty, staff, and students.
Unless otherwise noted, our events are presented in
Timken Lecture Hall
California College of Arts and Crafts
1111 Eighth Street, San Francisco (just off the intersection of 16th &
Wisconsin)

It seems like there are continual references to the situationists and
associated types on this list -- or perhaps I'm mistaken. I saw that
one of our members was -- as of a month or two ago -- reading "The
Activist Drawing" on the architectural drawings and ideas of
Constant, at one time affiliated with the SI. Since MIT has released
at least two books in the last year or so either collecting or
revisiting the works of the situationists, they are much more part of
the intellectual economy than is openly discussed in a place like
this. So, I'm wondering what sense people make of, what is the legacy
of, what ideas continue to make sense to, and why, with respect to
these critters known as the situationists. I'd be happy to map out
what particularly about them I'm curious about, since the term isn't
so useful as per normal. Have I missed the conversations about these
folks? Mostly we get performances based upon interpretations of their
ideas (for example, the "flame" as form of detournemont -- though I
would disagree with that reading) or citations, which the piece
mentioned below seemed like (since it's performance also seemed
unfinished to me)...perhaps that is a silly question. Sorry if that
is so.

here is a message I'm forwarding from
Stephen M. Baraban
__________________________________________

As a conscientious lurker I've been following the
discussion of the experimental sonnet with interest.
I'd like to bring in the sonnets of the late
Blake/Olson explorer John Clarke. I think others on
this list who know about his work may be hesitating
re/ classifying his sonnets as "experimental" in the
same sense as what else has been mentioned--they are
maybe that, but also, what shall we call them,
intensely "informational" poems--and they didn't even
spring to my mind until a day or two after first
encountering this discussion, even though Jack & his
work were & are an immense presence for me.

_In The Analogy_ is a volume consisting of 6 books of
40 sonnets each, 4 sonnets from the planned 7th book
(all in all, 12 books were projected).



Here's a sonnet from Book 1:

               The New Classicism

"It is thus necessary to play a game of at least equal
complexity"
      --Jean Baudrillard

"For a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
And I would call it fair play"
      --Miranda, *The Tempest* V.i

"Money allows you to mix in the club of
decision-makers,"
      --Adnan Khashoggi

"Phoenix entombed
in blazing pyre sings:
'Living or dying
All is bright fire'."
      --Philip Whalen, "Something Childish but
Completely Classical"

No one's in charge, there's only the charge,
but woe onto those who take advantage of
the situation, deregulation, piling on after
the whistle has blown, they may not have
stress analysis tests for the Furies yet but
that doesn't mean we can't detect different
rhythmic organizations, people don't realize
that extrapolation from boundaries is registered
throughtout the system, happily Ivan Boesky
wasn't bad enough to let the Frost Ogres in,
but eventually someone will be insouciant
enough unless Romanticism returns to school
in time to avert world cram or the new bonzai
miniaturization equals the reason of fairplay.

________________


The book is still available, (shuffaloff press)
publisher Mike Boughn tells me (pbk, sewn: $18.00 US,
$23.00 CDN; hdbk: $35.00 US, $45.00 CDN). Mike can be
contacted at 11 Conrad Ave., Toronto ON  M6G 3G4, or

Not yet- I'm told one is in the works, due shortly. An interview with WP's
founders appears in the spring 1998 issue of _The Review of Contemporary
Fiction_. A good read in the meanwhiles.

Apologies for cross-posting (conditions apply) or if you can't get to London


Prologue

Last Tuesday, SVP presented John Hall and Will Rowe - an excellent and
varied reading with a good audience, a *large audience considering the tube
strike

& thanks to all those who took the trouble to send apologies because of
transport difficulties - it does help to know; and big thanks to all those
many who were able to turn out


Part the first

The autumn season continues, but with some changes to the mechanics

PLEASE NOTE For a while, meetings will be on Mondays

& the next reading is on Monday 7 October 2002

with a double bill of John Chris Jones / Caroline Bergvall

AND the venue will be Camden People's Theatre which is at the corner of
Hampstead Rd & Drummond St -  don't go to Farringdon, not on SVP's account

The tube station is Warren Street altho Euston and Euston Sq are quite
doable for most people

Loads of buses, # 24 among them

There's a bar at CPT & Drummond St has a number of cheap eating places

AND admission to SVP readings at CPT is £6 with concessions at £4, payable
*before entry

PLEASE SUPPORT THIS EVENT: it isn't just a temporary change of venue; it
expands what is possible.


Executive summary:-

Next SVP *Monday 7 Oct 2002 8 pm
featuring John Chris Jones and Caroline Bergvall

Location Camden Peoples Theatre

Admission £6 / £4

taylor,

thanks for posting this. i was actually in downtown music gallery on e. 5th st in the village this past saturday afternoon, and one of the employees had been at the concert kowald was playing at in williamsburg the previous night. apparently kowa ld had either just moved to NYC or was seriously thinking about moving there permanently. anyway, they all went back to william parker and patricia nicholson's place, kowald was complaining of not feeling very well, had a heart attack and died.

there's o f course many recordings on which one can appreciate kowald's wonderful playing, and i'm far from having or hearing them all.  of course the 1968 landmark "machine gun" with the peter brotzmann octet. we can thank john corbett's unheard music series for b ringing back some of the most important schlippenbach recordings. one of the more recent ones that has really caught my attention is a trio recording with rashied ali and assif tsahar: kowald's bass is thick, full, and upfront, cutting through ali's shimm er-skitter trap drum set and tsahar's tenor and bass clarinet torsions. the final number has kowald's throat-singing as a chilling and powerful undercurrent.

cheers,
tom orange

I am the person who heard the story of the spent ten
dollars. I am now eager to gain capital and initiate
transactions of my own, so that I too may torque the great
wheel of commerce. What poem would I write to express my
desire?

WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 2 [8:00pm]
A TRIBUTE TO KENNETH KOCH
Kenneth Koch (1925-2002) was one of the Poetry Project's most revered elders
and gave many inspired readings and brilliant talks over the Project's
entire history. He was a core member of the first generation of the New York
School of Poets.  A renowned poet and energetic teacher, Kenneth Koch had a
passion for communicating his own belief that poetry was life itself. His
books on teaching, Wishes, Lies and Dreams (1970) and Rose, Where Did You
Get That Red? (1990), are a confirmation of his celebrated pioneer status in
bringing poetry into the classroom. The most recent collections of his own
poetry are New Addresses (Knopf, 2000), On the Great Atlantic Rainway:
Selected Poems 1950-1988 and One Train, a collection of new work (both
published by Knopf in 1994). His books of poetry include Seasons on Earth
(1987), On the Edge (1986), The Duplications (1977), The Art of Love (1975),
When the Sun Tries to Go On (1969), Thank You and Other Poems (1962), and Ko
(1960). His plays, many of them produced off- and off-off-Broadway, are
collected in A Change of Hearts (1973), One Thousand Avant-Garde Plays
(1988) and The Gold Standard (1996). He has also published fiction--The Red
Robins (1975), a novel, and Hotel Lambosa (1988), short stories. His
collaborations with painters have been the subject of recent exhibitions at
the Ipswich Museum in England and the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in New York. He
received the Bollingen Prize in Poetry in 1995 and has received awards from
the American Academy of Arts and Letters, as well as the Ingram-Merrill and
Guggenheim foundations. Kenneth Koch taught at Columbia University.

Speaking and reading will be Robert Creeley, Jordan Davis, Michel Deguy, Ed
Friedman, Katherine Koch, David Shapiro, Mark Statman, Alex Katz, Frank
Lima, Charles North, Eric Brown, Arnold Weinstein, Ron Padgett, Tony Towle,
Paul Violi, Anne Waldman, Dean Young, Emily Harvey, Alex Katz, Gary Lenhart,
Frank Lima, Anselm Berrigan and others.

FRIDAY OCTOBER 4 [6:00pm and 10:00pm]
AN EVENING OF POETRY AND MUSIC WITH WILL ALEXANDER
Will Alexander's latest titles are Above the Human Nerve Domain (Pavement
Saw Press) and Towards the Primeval Lightning Field. His forthcoming book is
entitled Exobiology as Goddess (Manifest Press).  He was a recipient of a
Whiting Fellowship for Poetry in 2001 and a California Arts Council
Fellowship for Poetry in 2002.  After his reading at six, Will and musician
Alan Semerdjian will perform with Tradewinds! Poets4Life, hosted by Carl
Hancock Rux.

Paul Hoover's _Nervous Songs_ was mentioned on this thread, which
reminded me how much I enjoyed that section of his _Totem and
Shadow: New and Selected Poems_ (Talisman, 1999).

Here's the first poem in that section. It gives you a feel of the tone
and method of his project, I think. How he works the middle swerve .
. . is beautiful.


MEYER IS A BUM

Perfection is an old heartache, the lasting
imbalance when two equal opposites meet.
Perfection makes an arch like a song,
ascending to passiveness from brute force.
When the singer is imperfect, a sailor
beating with oars, the song does not proceed,
turns in curcles, sinks. Eccentric wheels,
irregular as pears, move powerfully as verbs,

but Meyer with his perfect daughters, Meyer
is a bum. He floats like an angel in his tub.
The voices in a choir sound awful one at a time,
magnificent together. Meyer is singing along,
happy to find the world enlarged (it's smaller).
Perfection is a car to drive. Meyer is a bum.

The ten bucks i stole out of your pocket
I gave the guy falling asleep at the bar stool-
the bar tender picks it up as a tip
wakes him up
and tells him "thanks buddy."
"what shit? what do you want?"

dear Jordan,

my 10 dollars is a farmer now, and living earth colours, tho I forget which.
the 10 dollars is still my friend, and being that, we go on. on in moments
of explaining songwriting to ears made of treaties, on in just about any
variance from the strict tempo markings that society, etc, paints on the
moonshine of the next terrific idea, on while diametrically opposed to the
thing across the way that constantly crosses over. moreover, and this is
where I think the poem begins, there is an excitement of time fixed in
space. it seems like thee's a war on, it seems like children are small and
useful, but the 10 dollars has been sprea into a patient inkling that, well,
that seems all right. that's the best poem I had to do. thanks for asking,

Hilton. This is good: in the main you are right. There is somehing quite
bizarre, frighteningly bizzarre about this "obsession" wth Hussein (the =
name
conveniently rhymes with "insane"  (hence the role of language here)) =
but
the US supported S Hussein up to the invasion of Kuwait and also against
Iran. Then when the Kuwait debacle was over they "failed" to get rid of
Hussein and  "failed" to back the Kuwaitis and so on. Bush knows that
Hussein has no  military fight back capacity. He knows that thousands of
children and others are dying because of the embargo: but he is =
heartless.
He hates people - especially Arabs - he's a racist and a fascist.   He
relies on millions of ignorant people who dont study these matters: and =
in
that his "ploy" may work...my feeling is that you are heading for a =
worse
situation than the Second World War and that Bush is not only more =
dangerous
than Hussein he is very much more dangerous than Hitler could have been
(considering the enormous firepower he has at HIS control)....I also =
think
it is the fascination with Bush and the Republicans with power: pure =
power.
They have more money than they'll ever want. They just want to attack =
and
bomb and butcher and bleed and kill: obliterate...they are fascinated by =
the
power to destroy and enslave...their mad logic is that they will head =
off
Europe and any Arab alliance and China and so on but behind it is  also =
just
testosterone: blood lust. And it doest look as though anyone has the =
guts to
stop him. And whatever peole say ..the Germans, anyone, the Republicans =
will
ignore them. They dont care what anyone outside the US thinks. And they =
will
use every and any means including nuclear bombs if they think it will =
"do
the job".   Richard Taylor.

Meditations in a Time of Delusions and Lies - 4

It's rare to be conscious of impending doom, to know that we live in a
moment when time is running out, as if we're all condemned prisoners
waiting for our last dawn.  How pleasant life is, even though soon our
sweet peaceable world will come to an end, and we will be plunged into
horror.  Now, in this pause before the storm, all we can do is scratch =
our
heads and wonder: what the hell is going on?  Why do we face such grief?

Bush is dead set on "regime change" in Iraq, and he is pummeling the
American public and world leaders to follow his scheme.  Saddam Hussein,
despicable tyrant that he is, poses little threat to anyone, according =
to
most military experts, and, despite unfounded allegations, he does not =
even
seem to have had anything to do with the criminal devastation of 9/11.  =
He
didn't seem to pose much of a threat even in Bush's eyes, despite his =
being
strung along the "axis of evil" -- at least not until Enron and =
Halliburton
began to unravel.  Yet the destruction of Saddam Hussein has become an
obsession.  During hearings, a Senator asked Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld what America would do if Hussein made every concession demanded =
of
him, and the folksy Secretary could only sputter, unable even to imagine
diplomatic success.  Clearly, no matter what Saddam Hussein says or =
does,
the Bush administration seems determined to go to war, and ordinary =
Iraqis
and Americans -- indeed, the entire world -- are condemned to watch (and
pay the consequences) while the juggernaut rolls on.

Now, I assume that the administration is not stupid (despite Bush's =
famous
denseness).  I assume that it does not believe its own lies (although it
may very well be blinded by arrogance).  Certainly, we can ignore all =
the
inflated talk about democracy and principles and morality.  No, we can
dispense with platitudes and propaganda.

So, if they really know that the sudden alarm over Iraq is a ploy, then
what is their game, really?  Of course, the obvious -- oil -- comes to
mind, just as natural gas and pipeline routes make Afghanistan and =
Central
Asia far more interesting to the administration beyond the
Taliban.  Perhaps no one recalls how, before the attacks, the Taliban =
were
ignored, despite their oppression of women and desecration of ancient
monuments; they were even courted for pipelines and praised for their
Draconian programs to uproot heroin poppy fields.  Distracting the =
American
public from the messiness of crony capitalism or engineering economic
recovery with a good war -- yes, these too seem like plausible
motives.  But, still, if we assume that the administration is not =
stupid,
these reasons are not adequate, at least not for the great risks and =
costs
of war.

I would like to suggest the real reason we are about to be plunged into
war: WORLD DOMINATION.  No, this is not the plot of a superhero comic =
book;
this is for real.  Time really is running out, according to the Bush
administration's way of thinking -- but not on Saddam Hussein's secret
weapons.  The real target is Europe, uniting as never before and
increasingly becoming an economic rival; the real target is Russia, =
still
weak but not for long; the real target is China, growing at a fantastic
pace and a potential military rival; and let's not forget Japan, always =
an
economic threat, particularly in collaboration with the rest of Asia,
despite its recent faltering.  All of these "threats" are either weak or
nascent.  So Bush and Company must strike while the iron is hot, while
Americans are frightened enough to allow civil liberties to be junked =
and
jingoism to sound like self-defense.  If U.S. military and business
interests can maintain and even expand their control of Middle East oil
production, they have Europe and Japan by the balls, and much of the =
rest
of the world, as well.

Keep in mind the recent policy declarations: the U.S. will strike first,
even with nuclear weapons, against any country it deems a threat, with =
or
without the consent of the international community; no country will be
allowed to build up its military to rival the U.S.; no international
commitments, from environmental treaties to United Nations' votes to
international courts, will encumber the exercise of imperial power;
"nonproliferation" is now "counter-proliferation"; and on and on.  In =
the
eyes of any reasonable person, the United States has become far more of =
a
rogue state, dangerously flashing weapons of mass destruction, than any
other country.  Meanwhile, the "war on terrorism" has become a cover for =
a
never-ending war to maintain imperial control.  Americans are being
steamrolled into war and our democratic traditions are being twisted to =
the
satisfaction of reactionary saviors of "our way of life," all through =
the
manipulation of very real fears of terrorist violence.

There are those who object that an invasion of Iraq might be a quagmire =
or
that the whole Arab and Islamic world might erupt into chaos that will
threaten even U.S. allies.  Of course, the Bush administration hopes to
achieve its goals quickly and smoothly.  That would be ideal, in their
book, and they believe they can get away with it; but their basic =
response
is "So what?"  I suspect that the arch reactionaries in the =
administration
might even welcome chaos, since it will enable them more easily to cow =
the
Saudi and other client regimes.  After all, does it matter if the =
Hashemite
dynasty is overthrown in Jordan?  The administration and its supporters
might even cheer the imposition in the region of "democracy" in the form =
of
more pliable American clients; and they would certainly turn a blind eye =
to
the "transfer" and decimation of the Palestinian people by Ariel Sharon
done under cover of war.

To sensible, mainstream leaders, such calculations are almost the =
ravings
of lunatics.  During the period of d=E9tente during the Cold War, Soviet
leaders analyzed that there was a split in the American elite between =
the
"rational" and the "irrational" bourgeoisie, and that the "rational" =
forces
needed to be supported by the people to prevent disaster.  The =
"rational"
folks were willing to accept peaceful rivalry with the alternative =
economic
system, while the "irrational" elements were so motivated by their will =
to
power and by ideology that they would inflame militarism and embark on
dangerous schemes that could threaten world peace.  The Soviet Union
collapsed of its own collective mistakes -- but the analysis, in this
different context, may still hold some water.  The New York Times and =
other
elite forces, even conservative Republicans, may be considered =
"rational"
because they feel that U.S. preeminence can be protected without such
drastic actions, that the Bush-Cheney crowd is too willing to take too =
many
chances, too itchy to play with fire.  Of course, most Americans do not
even believe we should be in the game of world domination in the first
place.

At the very least, we should be clear about what is really at stake -- =
and
the danger posed by Saddam Hussein is the least of our problems.

I was digging for  a response from the Langpos: but I take the spirit of
what Merwin/Patrick is saying. Whether we are talking overt politics or that
a poet "should" be political...by moral force I mean a kind of
social-moral-human force or truth of a realisation  of what one is: and in
some cases a major poet might express fascist views...but that doesnt mean
that there is not still there the human-social connection:

I think that a lot of modernist and so-called postmodernist theorists have
overlooked the significance of Milton's poem  "Paradise Lost". Of course
poets that I enjoy and admire are_ seemingly _ or ostensibly, non-political:
Stein maybe and Trakl...but political I take in a wider sense: a deeper
sense of responsbilty to Being.

There was a time when I felt that I could ignore "meaning" per se and just
write "constructs"  (and I said this once at a reading) and it was my ex
wife infact who said: but there has to be some emotional content. I thought
about that a lot and now I refer to an emotional force that energises a
poem... But mey ex's comment actually set me thinking and events post S11 -
or S11 itself - (when I was planning to turn off and  tune out ) have
shocked me into re-thinking these issues.

"Poet" could of course be "person": but arent a lot  of the Language Poets
simply cowering rather than writing from a position of strength: and
retreating into verbiage and obscuratism as the darkness descends? Maybe I
am too...

But I havent thrown away the key an the locks remain uncorroded.

I don't know if I'd go that far -- plenty of people don't
have the courage of their convictions -- but this was more
or less my point.

Very few poets (are there any?) have the kind of public
voice that would make 'moral force' also a force for
change -- so it seems to me the moral responsibility of the
poet differs only slightly, if at all, from that of anybody
else. You build a cabinet or a house or knit a sweater or
write a computer program, and insofar as these activities
have a moral dimension it's a matter of mindful intention:
let this house stand firm and be a shelter and a place of
joy, etc. Of course the analogy of poet to carpenter is
flawed, since you could always swing your poem around and
aim it at a despot or whatever -- language is not neutral
like planks and nails -- but then what Kenneth Koch called
"poetry language" is not the same as political language, or
language with a propositional intent, at all. If Merwin was
saying -- I can't quite suss this out, and maybe he was
being deliberately ambiguous -- if he was saying that the
moral prerogative of the poet in times of crisis is to
speak out, not in poems, but in some kind of public way,
and that the poet should do this because he can be more
rhetorically effective than others, well fine. But
I think I'd approach it the other way round: you're a human
being, you have a moral impulse, how do you express it?
Speak out if it's given to you to do that -- think of Mario
Savio, no poet but a born orator. March in a parade; do a
sit-in; get arrested -- the first impulse of people with a
sense of life-as-theater. Turn Poetics into a political
forum -- that ain't nothing, in fact it's remarkable that
this list can sustain political discussion to the extent it
does. Or who knows, write poems with the mindful intention
of doing good work in both senses of the word. I don't
think that's the same as fiddling while Rome burns.

The numbness subsides after a few days. The nights
billow in from
the east with whiplash on her breath. Emotion takes
the sauce
from one pan and drizzles it into the spitting of
another. Brad
and Brittany remove their apartment from the realm of
things
abstract and flesh it out in shabby chic. The surface
of her skin
pretends to play hide and go seek with the doctor,
whose days are
numbered doubly by appointment book and calendar. It
took a while
to get into. It seems to come undone. Brad and
Brittany, found
obscene by their local apellate court, take a profound
yet
shortlived interest in general studies. The numbness
comes of age
and begins to collect on its inheritance. The night,
billowing,
has forgotten how much it hates these parties. As for
the surface
of his skin, the one that doctors the personal digital
assistance
of her palms stretched beyond meaning; it begins to
smell badly
after two days. Brittany and Brad wonder where all the
emotion
has gone.

I Reply:

Lang Poets (of which there are either very many or very few) sure do take
some hits on this list. But, to take your final elliptical phrase in tow, I will
assert that most poets of any stripe do not write from a position of strength.
(Even if I'm still not very clear what is meant by "position of strength".) As
well, if you're speaking of a clear political message in the text itself, I would
say that (and here comes that very old saw) the language is encoded with
the deadening politics of the status quo, and any poetry that seeks to
overthrow the expectations and givens of the language using populace is
indeed, quite political. A fundamental politics of revealing the abuses of the
language to itself. (Bah, one might say, I've heard this before...)

But as the gestures of Lang Po, Po Mo, Mo Rocca, and Rock 'n' Roll seep
into the ideolect of the general writing community, we have both a richer
mainstream art and a functional impasse for the avant garde (which doesn't
mean they should write differently, or take a different stand . . . maybe it
even calls for more fidelity to what it is that LangPos do that irritates so
many). Not really a reason to pick at the Language Poets though. Why not
have at the poetry of Robert Pinsky instead . . . if one wants to talk about the
failure of strength one should look at the culturally strong poets and hold
their feet to Plato's standard candle.

At least that's what I think this morning. And maybe I shouldn't have singled
Pinsky out. Any one of a number of poets would have worked, I'm thinking.

"I WON TEN DOLLARS"

   _for Jordan Davis_

Yeah, I won ten-dollars once, and a few certificates.
I won a tool box too. What other
  prizes? I won a Smith's crisp competition,
   a mini-imac clock, movie tickets, shaving samples, etc etc.

     In addition, I won ten dollars for swimming in the fountain
    in the New Sculpture Garden.
                                I won ten dollars in a foot race
   at work today. I remember when we used to rock.
  Behind the music, as if you cared.

Oh yeah ... and then I won ten dollars from this teacher
  because he thought no one could name Milosevic's successor

        (geez, we're not THAT American)
                        .

--------->It's hard to look like a pro
          when you have to look up
          what a "straight" is.
          I won ten bucks though.<-----------

                      I won ten dollars pulling on socks. Yeah,

            I won ten dollars at an amused snort.

        I won ten dollars from a scratch

    and that bought me a carton of cigs. Cigarettes are cheap--

         "more monkeys."

            I won ten bucks once, for singing
            "Frosty the Snowman"

Subject: A.Word.A.Day--pangram

pangram (PAN-gram, -gruhm, PANG-) noun

   A sentence that makes use of all the letters of the alphabet.

[From Greek pan- (all) + -gram (something written).]

Many typists know "The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog" as a
thirty-three-letter sentence that employs every letter in the alphabet at
least once. Now fix your eyes on a sampling of the best pangrams of even
fewer letters. What you are about to see are meaningful sentences that
avoid obscure words yet contain every letter of the alphabet:

Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. (thirty-two letters)
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz. (thirty-one)
How quickly daft jumping zebras vex. (thirty)
Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. (twenty-nine)
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud. (twenty-eight)
Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymph. (twenty-seven)

And now, wordaholics, logolepts, lexicomanes, and verbivores -- the Peter
Pangram of all pangrams --

Mr. Jock, TV quiz Ph.D., bags few lynx. (twenty-six!)

If you can come up with a twenty-six letter pangram that makes easy sense
and does not resort to names, initials, or mutant words, please rush it to
me at richard.lederer@pobox.com.

it's really impirtant, especially when people start crying out for blood

A blog is a "weblog" -- basically a place where people publish their
thoughts, their favorite things on the web, stray this or thats.

Free Space Comix: The Blog will have poems, what I'm reading, my latest
articles, etc.

Free Space Comix was the name of my first book.  I've always wanted it to be
made into a made-for-HBO movie starring Michael Douglas as the Korean deli
store owner, but it never happened.

So I've made it into a blog:

www.arras.net/weblog/

It doesn't let you send in comments yet, but that future is a feature
forthcoming.

August 12, 1995 was an impotrant day of celebration, when two bells were
consecrated, both a gift from Mr. Berty J. Koppelhuber from Germany.

Beeing a royal highness is not so impotrant for me. The impotrant thing is to
help the needy and listen to God and do want he wants me to do. I answered, In
My Heart. I began to think of the heart, as it is one of the most impotrant
organs in our body that if it stops functioning we stop to exist.

Security at home is so impotrant beacause it give you tranquility. Yeah. Peace
is the most impotrant thing we have, without it we would be lost. Chaos would
rule our lands, and all hopes of our people would be gone. However number of
new species is impotrant part of each birding trip on our excurtions we are
more focused on observations of tooting.

I think before we try to establish any sort of trust between the Palestinians
and the Israeli's we must ourselves's the very impotrant question, HOW MUCH DO
WE limit ourselves, without great ambitions, to an attempt whereby means of
several thjeses we shall outline several more impotrant results ... but
because we don't know ALL MATH involver, usually we deal with MOST IMPOTRANT
for the process under consideration math.

You are not an individual, you are one of many. You are not impotrant, the
colony is important. You are insignificant. It is impotrant to be aware that
however long your time, your funeral can be paid for at today's prices with
the guarantee that no further charges will be made.

IMPOTRANT: What will NOT work for the treatment of premature ejaculation: It
is because pepsin in the stomach can deactivate enzyme that relases xeronine
(most impotrant ingriedient that couse most healing effect) in intestine. We
have used it for christamas presents, impotrant documents, etc. Basically
everything! I do not use the anus and the penis. From this chakra four
impotrant nadis emanate which appear as lotus petals to apply presented
theories corrwctly to specific problem. Girls will laugh. Boys will even
laugh. How could my parents play with the most impotrant part of my body?

Axes upon the door. The Banner of The Wolf. The Human across from her was
lost, but impotrant. The Wolf glared at her, circled her. The restaurant
wavered. Impotrant was the position, assorted to us by time. In some other
moment she would slowly kill me in the same innocent way.

Today, I learned many impotrant attitude which we must do in talking to each
other ... iportants, mportants, importate, mmportant, ipportant, imprrtant,
imporaant, importnnt, importatt, miportant, ipmortant, imoprtant, improtant,
impotrant ... not get the job. And this is just one out of million reasons why
writing is impotrant and good for you. Having writing techniques ... sometimes
it is eaisy to think that the music means something.

Because no one have the strength to read anything I write, and since I don't
have anything impotrant or interresting to write, You all just have to put up
with meaning. You say, hey, this guy has an impotrant, strained voice. But,
the question: "Is it not the case with every ideological production?" is the
focal point and is much more impotrant.

Molly,

Many thanks for the offer of the list. I'm sure many of us would love to see
it, and it would probably save you a lot of trouble just to post it. I'm
sure no one will mind.

Thanks again!

I turned 50 this year and, being now senile, I need to relive the crux of
past caught in music, and those damn confounding colours. so, here's the
program, as it melts into my brow: can anyone share with me their energy,
circa 1968? specifically, did you SEE Moby Grape perform live? can you say
anything about Skip Spence? I'm seeing Einstein fucked up on acid, tears in
the taste of freedom, and words gushing in light tomorrow couldn't prove. I
want Moby info, or SF tinglings, or just something to see. this is a serious
request within the Poetics network, of minds and the carrying people to just
bug me with some new age. I got an idea waiting to happen. honest thanking
moments await you if you reply. yours sincerely, Allen

DO WE FEEL: A WORN GROOVES NOVEL

Do we feel "forgotten" and stowed away in some obscure place where no one
would give a thought about us--- do we feel very insignificant, just like
the Velveteen Rabbit?

To the east, hills (and the rising sun); to the south, hills; to the north,
hills; to the west, hills (and the setting sun). A small Moravian garden. It
is very small and very insignificant.

So here I sit 2000 years later at my little computer, in my little room and
I feel very insignificant and I feel hardly up to the challenge. It seems
like I have every possible obstacle against being a real evangelizer.

My testimony sure isn't fancy, and very insignificant compared to some that
I have heard. When I was about 3 or 4, I went to junior church and heard the
teacher give a lesson on hell, and why people went there. While this lesson
wasn't fancy, and not geared for people who were intellectually advanced, it
set an impression on my mind that I have never forgotten. It also forced me,
at that time, to make a decision for Christ. I realized that I was a sinner,
going to hell, in need of Salvation.

First the very insignificant point. Pronouns for God are not capitalized
in Arabic, Hebrew, or Greek, so why such a fuss for English, Jeremiah?

There are very few things which are *not* insignificant; all your ordinary
reactions, ordinary thoughts, sensations, actions, movements, - all this is
very insignificant.

I know that I am still very insignificant and tiny in the scheme of things,
a very ordinary man with extremely limited knowledge!

My very insignificant toes: I'm still not too sure how freaky it is to wake
up one morning and realize that... you're disappearing? on purpose.

So insignificant that I said if they ever had an extra looking for a new
home they could send it here.

Meanwhile, on an insignificant planet, in an insignificant solar system, in
an insignificant and rather decrepit old warehouse, some very insignificant
robots are starting an insignificant day in their insignificant lives.

The nature of the exponential growth pattern is characterized by very
insignificant growth at the front end and the dramatic growth towards the
end of the cycle.

Today I am very doubtful about the future of my life, which seems very very
insignificant seeing as though half the world is struggling to survive, I am
rich, I have a bed and blankets and clothes and tins of chickpeas and
mountain bread.

The executive pay portion of that is a very, very insignificant factor!

”The remarks,” GOP pollster Frank Luntz said, “were made on a very small,
very insignificant cable channel.”

"It affected a very, very insignificant number of people," she told me.
Apparently, I was one of those insignificant people. Maybe you were, too. I
suppose it's easy to think people are insignificant when all you see is
their credit card numbers.

The remuneration paid for, say, commenting on a social issue is very
insignificant, and teaching time does not suffer. So, it should be all right
that such activities need not be reported. However, some activities may
demand a lot of working time. For instance, when an election is taking
place, I may be required to spend a few days to do immediate analyses for
the broadcast media. Since this will affect the class schedule, prior
clearance from the University must be sought.

Take these experiences and match them to even other experiences within this
same lifetime.  As you engage these memories, they will bring other
memories; and by engaging these other memories, even other memories may be
engaged; and as these memories are engaged, they will all blend together
into a very small portion of your life, a very insignificant, so to speak,
expression; for upon a whole, all expressions and experiences would be
considered, in your terms, quite insignificant.

Someone from a very humble, very insignificant household, on the strength of
a very tenuous, very remote family connection.

Take an Orienteering course. When you're lost in the woods, being unemployed
will seem very insignificant.

This will make him talk to himself, and he will realise he has a pants sense
of
humour, and thereby make him feel very insignificant.

No...not funny...just stupid...like yourself really!

All Esther Tellermann's poetry - from the first line of her first=20
book: "time had the slowness of not-yet-asleep" - is an ongoing=20
hermetic journal of travels, possibly to real places, but certainly=20
to "the mind's other country." It takes the reader on an impossible=20
quest for meaning, for the ideal, for the elusive "central point"=20
where we would be one with the world. The poetry is, in itself, an=20
extraordinary answer to its own question: "how live/ in the ordinary?"

     Esther Tellermann was born in Paris in 1947. She is an agr=E9g=E9 of=20
letters and teaches in Paris, where she also works as a=20
psychoanalyst. Flammarion has published her five books of poetry:=20
Premi=E8re apparition avec =E9paisseur (1986), Trois plans inhumains=20
(1989), Distance de fuite (1993), Pang=E9ia (1996) and Guerre extr=E8me=20
(1999) from which "Mental Ground" [Terre mentale] is taken. Encre=20
plus rouge is forthcoming in 2003. She is currently working on a=20
novella and serving on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical=20
revue La C=E9libataire.

promises that
" NYMPHODIZIAC "
WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST TALKED ABOUT FILMS OF THE NEW MILLENIUM


Once more a question already raised comes back. Mr. Podles's work, let us
grant, has much more than theological relevance. We now have a good argument
that anthropology and psychology journals should address The Church
Impotent. But why The Mises Review? At last, we can fully respond.


A Thai man suffering from impotence has chopped off his penis with a meat
cleaver.

Bangkok police say the 49-year-old asked his doctor to arrange an amputation
because of his impotence.

The doctor advised Jaruwat Techawachayanun to seek help for the condition at
another clinic. He refused.

Witnesses say they saw him rest his penis on a stone and chop it off. He
then threw it in a bin.

A witness picked it out, packed it in ice and phoned police. Officers took
him to hospital. It is not known if it can be reattached.

Witness Tongdee Kongsombat told the Thai Daily News: "I saw a man pull up
outside my house in a pick-up truck.

"The man caught my attention because when he got out of the truck he had a
towel wrapped around his waist and a meat cleaver in his hand.

"He walked down a side street, sat down, rested his penis on a large stone
and with three chops severed it completely."

The witness retrieved it from the bin and called police who found Mr
Techawachayanun sitting in his truck bleeding heavily.

For in Britain the head of state supplies no alibi for the people who
matter, the elected politicians. There is no confusion: no double-rivalled
mandate, as in cohabitational France; no chance of semi-interference by the
semi-impotent but elected presidents of, say, Ireland or Germany; none of
the transience of the elected heads of other states, nor of the claim they
or their parties might make to a piece of the action. For the Queen has no
right to action. The one time she used her prerogative to settle something,
after Harold Macmillan's retirement in 1963, she followed the advice of
ministers. These days, with parties electing their leaders, even this
vestigial power would seem to be extinct.

how do people get impotant places in the titan clan??

A brothel for impotent men (0)

There is a unique brothel in the Japanese city of Osaka - the brothel for
impotent men. The brothel is owned by two brothers - Takeo and Kanebo Isida.
They say that their brothel helped a lot of men to get rid of their
complexes, some of them even managed to get their man power back.

Being the ex wife of a arsanist, I no how emportant it is to catch people
starting fires. Kids need to learn fire is not a toy, it is a harmfull
threat not only to people but to animals and even themselfs.

Love in the heady hours of daylight savings time
always works out. Then I saw her face; now I'm

a believer! Sunshine in the off-season learns
the pre-meditated delight of playing about

her dappled shoulders. For dry skin, especially
around the elbow regions, birds suddenly appear.

The slit throat of the sun winnows with washing
darkness from the
scrubs of fences. The poet, along with his American
humming-bird
(sheltered in a cage from the ferocity of autumn)
wallows in rain
the size and softness of her belly; something he
always thought
possible but only read about previously in album
reviews in
Rolling Stone. This column of text is reminiscent of
her bed. It
dribbles down the page, much like creamed corn tricks
the corners
of an invalid's mouth into twitching. A tour-de-force
in pure
noise, heroic land music populates an abstract region
somewhere
between statehood and fast food. The comfort of it is
astonishing! The poet, sheltered from the ferocity of
a cage of
gilded time-and-a-half, flutters her wings so quickly
they're
invisible to the unaided eye.

The glasses surgically embed beams of science
fiction in her eyes, still scanning the sky
for import into photoshop. After the catharsis

of their last collaboration, the poet and his
exponential bird blast off this time for
saving daylight in a jar, which, frozen, can

seem both imposing and ridiculous in this light.
A bottle of hours is opened in their silver
space-ship. But robots never need lotion.

Subject:      why codework
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

why codework


wary of any art movement tending towards genre, not that the two are
simultaneous or even related. there are limits to codework; on one hand
the code itself, on the other the process the code sends - what - through
- text/image/subject/object/monad/desire - think of it as retinal
filtering - that is the isolation, production, and naming of objects
within the continuum of the world - it's both structure and generative
process - the latter tending towards ontology.

what is, is the domain of production - the input, to the extent that it is
text/image etc. - i.e. not generated within the program itself - is
parasitic, the third term within the communication process - on one hand
traditional 'content' - on the other - 'noise' within the system that
modifies and is modified by the output.

i tend to think of this in terms of two large-scale operations - that of
consciousness and its relation to inputting and outputting - fuzzy and
rough domains at best - not a behavior analysis - but one stressing the
interpretation and phenomenology of consciousness within the filter -
seeing this as the way the world is, that is to say the relationship of
consciousness to the world is vis-a-vis formal and informal systems in
which filtering/language produces discrete elements in relation to
consciousness on one hand and the world on the other -

and then again - the second large-scale operation - that of the universe -
plasma, virtual particles - the disruptions and collusion/collocation of
structures - momentary buildups, impediments - codework at the limits in
other words connecting, a connector among others, between self and cosmos
- without descent into the mu of zazen for example - or ma, space/interval
- looking at correlated particles for example in relation to, but not
always, the space between them -

so that there is a production of meaning, the gleaning from across all of
this - structure, process, the parasitic - it's the production that is
also an inhabitation and interpretation by consciousness - it's the
situation of being-human in the world - it's worlding itself -

at least this is how it seems to me, the movement-genre is irrelevant -
what's important is the exploration of consciousness and the relationship
among articulated entities in the world - there's something of cognitive
psychology to this (but messier) and something of art as well (but more
exact, almost uncomfortable, diacritical) -

not a movement or genre but the loose domain or pooling of the confluence
of structure and content (in the traditional sense), subject and object
(in the traditional sense), i and not-i (in the traditional sense) -
dichotomy itself - or the very nature of distinction - the sheffer stroke
or its dual for example as the basis - neither a nor b - not both a and b
- already tending towards the quantum mechanics of superimposition and the
phenomenology of the gesture -

Victory of the Loud Little Handful

by Mark Twain


The loud little handful--as usual--will shout for the war. The pulpit

will--warily and cautiously--object... at first. The great, big, dull bulk

of the nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try to make out why there should

be a war, and will say, earnestly and indignantly, "It is unjust and

dishonorable, and there is no necessity for it."


Then the handful will shout louder. A few fair men on the other side will

argue and reason against the war with speech and pen, and at first will

have a hearing and be applauded, but it will not last long; those others

will outshout them, and presently the antiwar audiences will thin out and
lose

popularity.


Before long, you will see this curious thing: the speakers stoned from

the platform, and free speech strangled by hordes of furious men...Next the

statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is

attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing

falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any

refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself that the
war
is just,

and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of

grotesque self-deception.

I am not attacking alngauge poets as such altho I was fishing a bit. I
wanted some "spirited" responses from the Langpos....but maybe ths angle of
attack was worked out a year or so a go....but ceratin consepts remain valid
in regard: I would avoid labelling the List or people on it as "stalinist"
though as
thhe attacks need to be directed towards issues.....

But, to take your final elliptical phrase in tow, I will

No, not always: I dont want to see social realism: in fact eh kid of writing

quite political as...

Yes but its god to be aware of: at one exreme the danger of too much
Orwellian mis-speak and at the other the conundrum of too much stagey
rhetoric. I'm thinking of the overall "mission" or function  of the
poet...if there is one........

I was directing some guns toward them because often one finds that
non-langpos or the more "mainsteam" or however you defeine are more
responsibly politcal: this warns against teh danger of the french theory
adling peoples' brains; that said...i'm wel aware of the "danger" of too
much "transparency"....it too can lead you into Farbenland...

I  know that Marjorie Perloff couldnt write about Pinsky as she felt his
poetry was basically "bad" but I recall reading a poem of his I liked very
much
I think what I was doing was I was speaking as if I was a right wing
opponent of all things "postmodern" and thus as the devil's advocate hoping
to galvanise Ron etal as their poetcs is always political and i think that
politics cannot be boxedinto a box; however that the language we use
barriers us into spinning around "truth" I would agree: but something in
patrick's quote got me going and I suppose also the current "emergency"
...although, in a sense, there always is, or isnt, an emergency....there's s
some hw a need to connect up eg Silliman's practice of using the
marxist/hegelian dialectic as a method and the notion the meaning (or in
fact the whole deal) "should" operate on the sentence (or even at the single
word level with the need for anther connecting step into the "real world"
whatever that is.....

I had some further ideas on all this after a friendly back-exchange with
Nick and am now reading his book (Theoretical Discourse) and want to show
the political social psychological phenomenological and everything eperience
adn significance of much of that but beed to read it through a few times. So
far there are som extraordinary things going on in there for me......

I dont think that politics can be separated out: hard to think of an actual
non-political thing.....is any statement or event...maybe eg certain
experiential, physical psychical such as the physical mystical experience of
sex...the arena of the libidinal...ultimately we are all under the eye...

will get back....   Richard Taylor

as children. Or else, Macchu Piccu, while

babble aggravates a gravity cooled and
vacated of concatenation, the newly

our childhoods' children molded from

Brad and Brittany's engagement party was at a quarter

would take at
least half an hour, traffic notwithstanding. To
prepare for the

of cloud ovulate frenetically, keeping time

I am sorry to tell you that Bob Cobbing died peacefully and painlessly at 3
a.m. this morning

Jennifer and some of his children were with him.

Jennifer just gave me the news, and it was she who said that it was so calm
for him

She agrees that everyone must know; but I think she wants time to herself.
She spoke of it being *some *days before she makes the next necessary steps.

She is very tired as you can imagine; and, if I may take it on myself to
ask, I think it would be better if she weren't phoned now. Her son is with
her.

Write, do write; I'm sure she'd like that

As I know more, I will let you know.

Writers Forum continues. The workshop continues. And arrangements have been
made for the care of Bob's work. More on all that in due course. But for now
a
necessary pause...

all best to all

I dont think Amiri Baraka should resign. There's a stupid attitude =
fostered that people cant talk about S11 because some poeple got killed. =
Well for that reason you may as well censor every poem  writtem  eg =
Wallace Stevens's poem "In a Nigger Cemetary.." and so on. In fact it is =
quite possible that the Isaelli secret service cooperated with the US =
CIA etc in the plot of S11 and in fact it could have included even some =
so-called Al Qaeda. It could very easily be an iside job and we know =
that the US Govt gives Israel US$billions in actual cash and military =
hardware each year (otherwise it wouldnt survive).  I doubt that Baraka =
is anti-semitic per se: maybe he is, but the way that Israel is trying =
to exterminate the Palestinians this is not surprising: Black people who =
are politically intelligent would empathise with the plight of the =
Palestinians. And the reaction to Baraka's poem shows the hypocrisy of =
the stuffed shirt "upholders of he public good". And Sharon is in fact =
basically a war criminal having been responsible for at least one =
massacre and in my book so is Bush and so is Blair: Blair was satirised =
recently...he uses a wierd, disconnected language. The British press =
journalists (on a BBC programme I saw) in fact have said that they can =
never get him to say anything that is meaningful. He and Bush are like =
Punch and Judy but they're on the same side.  The rhetoric of a cowboy =
from the East and then the non-speak or triple speak of Blair the wonder =
boy from...god knows where.

I think that its quite possible the Isarelis together with US helped =
carry out the S11 to lubricate their campaign against the Palestinians.

I would like to see Israel destroyed. It is a group of invadors and =
criminals who are not from that area: they are agressive and =
vicious...they dont belong there. They are aliens. They are Europeans =
mostly who arent from that place. Or they are but only in as much as =
everyone is originally from Africa.

A compromise seems impossible: for their own survival the Arabs should =
get together and obliterate the Israelis. Its quite clearly the only =
way. It would be good if Hussein had nukes - really - the Israelis would =
not be so keen to brutalise. Like the Nazis they dont know where or when =
to stop so like them they need to be driven out ... Baraka is right to =
speak out on these matters as Mohammed Ali did in the Vietnam war days.

But that doesnt mean that he has a "duty" to. And in fact I realise now =
that Merwin's  rhetoric applies to "person" not just poet as some very =
great poets have been a-political, probably a-moral (or their morality =
is "screwed") ... I dont think there is any moral imperative. So one =
does takes a position: and Baraka's is one. People who want him to =
resign are like those people who didnt like the teaching of Darwin: or =
who suppress eg von Daniken or whoever... or should we supress Mein =
Kempf: if someone wants to read Mein Kempf well that's their business - =
on the reverse side of the coin I think that Salaman Rushdie should be =
allowed to write his Satanic verses and so on.

I'm not very intersted in Baraka's poetry, but I'm glad he's taking a =
strong stand.  Richard Taylor. =20

Richard,

Assuming you are not Maori (or a related tribe), should't you also get out of
where you live? Shouldn't New Zealand be destroyed?

This one almost got by me.  Thanks to my partner with the antennae, Mike
Magazinnik, for directing me.  Bob Perelman's interview in Electronic Poetry
Review #4 is a must read.  Note his remarks on language poetry/writing, self
and narrative.  This is a wise man.  Best, Bill

Richard, I usually agree and respect you, but in fact Baraka has a long
history of anti-semitism, for which he apologized several decades ago.

This post is beneath you. I'm furious that such rumors, which are on the
level of holocaust denial, persist.

Virginia with her heel which faulty attentions would burst
         with her ship's surgeon brought ashore for the ride
         with her hand sounding this roster
         Virginia who heard the shot during her crawl uphill
Virginia with her inadmissible blot sold into darkness
         whose long-legged volunteering petrified them all
Virginia with her toenails waylaid by ruffians, Virginia who
         agrees with me that not everyone understands insouciance
Virginia with her covenant concluding her speech
         with her foil tip bustling up the haze of spite
         with her window erased five miles south
         with her horse insisting the crowd be waved away
Virginia high and dry like the tail of an unworldly person
         with her faint pandemonium quarried back around
         whose symptoms caught their breath once in the evasion's shade
Virginia with her non sequiturs crouched and rotted
         with her rigidly unremarkable canine teeth
         Virginia with Byrd at the South Pole
Virginia who might have envied the sob still ahead
         with her summit sounding like a Spanish doctor
Virginia limping through the pages to indicate sleepless purpose
         with her shovel pressed for answers twice daily
Virginia whose verse is too late for the fetus
         with her clay on all fours beneath her skirt
         with her blue sky movements feverishly across the lake
         with her withered scabbard scissoring briefly to life
Virginia whose nerves are still staring out to sea
         Virginia with her recognition tucked into my waistband
         with her uncommon constitution prepared for another midst
         with her perverse need for antiquated conveniences
         with her insinuation that lucidity is better at a distance
Virginia with her still-burning ordeal of abolitionist reserve
         with her hospitable inclusion of coordinate predicates
Virginia whose last twilight went in for a ten-year stretch

The premier issue of Sentence: A Journal of Prose Poetics is scheduled to
appear in Fall, 2003. We are proud to announce that our board of
Contributing Editors includes Maxine Chernoff, Russell Edson, Michel
Delville, and Peter Johnson.

The objectives of Sentence are:

1. To continue the tradition established by Peter Johnson’s The Prose Poem:
an International Journal (dormant) of publishing excellent prose poems
2. To publish reviews and essays (personal, critical, experimental, etc.) on
the prose poem, prose poets, and the poetics of the prose poem
3. To continue the discussion about the distinction between the prose poem
and “poet’s prose” (why is this distinction useful? are there other
distinctions to be made?)
4. To explore the gray areas around the prose poem, especially in work that
exists on the boundary between the prose poem and free verse on one hand and
between the prose poem and the essay on the other
5. To publish work that extends conceptions of what the “prose poem” is or
can be

We will be reading for the first issue through May 1, 2003. Please send
submissions to Sentence, c/o Firewheel Editions, PO Box 793677, Dallas, TX
75379. Please direct queries to editor@firewheel-editions.org.

Electronic submissions are acceptable at the addresses above by email, on
diskette, or on CD in .pdf format or in a text-only file. Please do not copy
submissions into the body of an email message. Submissions in other file
formats will not be read. Diskettes must be in PC format until further
notice.

We recognize that subscribers to the POETICS list are doing important and
exciting work in these areas, and we look forward to sharing our pages and
our interests with you. Again, please direct any questions to
editor@firewheel-editions.org.

Sincerely,

We Make Defective Kaleidoscopes
(Skaanda of the Molar Aggregates) (WIP-model)



conception (sa~nj~naa); manifestations of desiring machines (symbols, =
fetishes, structures of thought, narratives) code

deadpan beauty of  desiring-machine-reef,=20
gentle toil clothed in fascinations (photo dept.)
host controllers balk, EI to be reset
production backs up and is rerouted
person-L not allowed to make decisions
not allowed to be put in the position to make mistakes
keep it cattle simple and move the mass
multiple devices, multiple layers
multiple chemicals, multiple exposure sources
redundant alignment systems
everything turned to a spectacle of numbers
equations determined in one set of hours
resonate through another predetermined set
and so on ad nauseum

sensation (vedanaa); domains of presence or zones of intensity =
(voluptas). surfaces are decoded

but aside from all this panopticality
there are roundnesses, skewed traces of elemental flotsam
simplicities whose intensity mocks the baroque fundament of indexes
sounds which seemed milked from the void by velocity's muse
2867 RPM on a PEK vacuum chuck
rotary gridblur, animated penumbra of theatrical solvents=20
terse mechanicisms viewed through aesthetic criteria
to become an electric terpsichora of microphysica
motor return to anima in meanings beyond function or speach
their voices recognizable, sensors tricked
3character codes leap like toads in a gridded swamp
a humidity controlled, positively pressurized retort of logic
whose homunculi enact a robust skin, over the constant symbol

volition (sam.skaara); molecular energy that places molecules-partial =
objects (libido) in connection, execution

DIK, COK, GOD, FAG, XUT, TIT, UGH, NUT, LAB, FUT, HAK, MUO
GUI, MUD, ZAP, TUD, MIK, LOI, POL, REW, QUA, LIP, UIN, TSA
HAT, OIL, NUI, GYT, HER, PCV, FES, IDS, VOO, REH, DZO, RUN
KEN, YUM, LOK, ERR, DED, LEP, NUB, CUT, TRU, RER, GCH, NEU
DIM, SLY, PIG, EYE, GAK, POR, KIL, JIM, EAR, AWE, ENN, OOP
CUM, BAT, OFF, LOP, FUL, EEL, LEG, KEG, HOL, RIN, SEX
these are pod codes, each with an attendant bar code
which like an emblem of penal servitude, hides the
architectural elegance of the machinic and modular womb
of production. then they are cracked open to be processed..

the material organism (ruupa); giant molecule of the body without organs =
(numen), the transmolar interface of surface

vernacular ease lurches from behind hulking implements
youths grab and posture in mythic deportments, horse-like
in their horseplay, like gortex clad sileni wearing safety glasses
girls giggle at their SEM stations, staring into nanometric worlds
of flawed implementation, guided by commercial software
into trancelike states resembling satori, grey mice gliding silent
in the human intervention of some agency's flawed perceptual metric
a man has inserted himself into an opening in a machine
another man is handing him tools, a lifeless oscilloscope
sits nearby from earlier investigations, his boot is coming off

and consciousness (vij~nana). the entire field of production, inclusive =
of all disjunctions, the bus and the processor in state

white grid, made yellow, laminar flow
the constant blinking of error lights,=20
the rows of pods, the libraries in process
the robots whining as they ascend, spin, descend
and accellerate, x, y, z and thetasimultaneous
the old faces grinning as they joke, typing annotations
the gamboling youths, balancing pods on hips
the cursing of the technicians, closing their eyes
and reaching into the blind and delicate spaces
where the only prey is an adjustment node

It's True


Around September 10 a yearf ago, Azure and I were sitting in our Miami
apartment. The phone rang. It was a call forwarded from New York.

I said, Hi, who is it. Shlomo, the voice said. I don't know any Shlomo,
I said. It doesn't matter, he said. Get out of the World Trade Center, he
said. I'm not in the World Trade Center, I said, I'm in Miami.

All the Jews are in Miami, he said, they all got out the World Trade
Center. What are you talking about, I said.

He said, look, I'm Israeli, I got another 3999 calls to make. What's the
occasion, I said. They're doing it to the buildings, he said. Who's they,
I asked naturally. I was really curious.

Bush and us, he said. We're blaming it on Laden, he said. How will this
affect the conspiracy, I said. Which one, he said, the International
Zionist Conspiracy or The Pigs of Zion. I don't know, I said, the usual
group, I've been following the Protocols of Zion for two decades now.
I want to do everything I can. I think of the energy you've had to call
all 4000 Israelis who were going to the WTC - even looking up their
addresses must have taken an hour or two. You put us to shame, I said.
I'll do anything you want, I said.

You should, he said. Not enough of our people really want to help. Can I
put you down on the list? I said I'm not sure I wanted to be part of a
list that wanted me. For the International Jewish Monetary Fund Propaganda
Arm, he said. Of course, I said, anything for the cause. You know we all
support Israel in absolutely everything it does. Even blowing up the WTC?
Of course, I replied. I'd been joking with him; I knew about the fake Arab
names all along.

Later, I called Frankie and passed on the information. You'd be amazed how
many Jews we got out of there. We've got to live to fight another day.
There are so many Christian children to be caught for Purim and Passover.
We don't have any time to lose.

Okay I might as well throw my "hat" into the asking-for-a-list "ring" since
there's been all these recent lists as of late people asking for sonnet
lists and black poet lists and women poet lists and maybe acadominant lists
or flarf lists or nikuku lists and so on and so forth and even several
backchanneled me thinking I was compiling a list of poets who name like
O'Hara but actually now
it                                                                    occurs
to me that
i am actually
interested
at least a little or
perhaps just bored
enough                                                                   to
ask this list people
if they know of
specific
poems that may be
called lyric that occur
in
roughly this form
which may not
actually
come through on
the email listserv as
I
am trying to render
it here, what i
mean
specifically is poems
that actually have
HOLES                                                                     in
them. I think I've
seen some of these
before
but I'm curious how
many of them there
are
or might have existed
because I was
reading
somewhere that since
lyrics generally
present
themselves as surr-
ounded by nothing or
by
white space that they
therefore encourage
the
isolated moment and
this therefore is
something
that i'm sure some of
"our" lyricists would
want                                                                     to
challenge or
invert perhaps though
maybe                                                                 not
and or then why
and so I'm not really talking about slight typographical variations a la
Williams' 3 steps
or even concrete poetry that emphasizes the materiality of letters etc but
actually poems
that might be rather traditional when it comes to meaning etc. but
nonetheless somehow
wants to invoke the idea that it is not per se surrounded by nothing not per
se an isolated
moment or maybe that would not even be the intention maybe such a poem would
just
want to "frame" the silence and this is actually a rather silly form and so
praise be the
isolated moment but what the hell i might as well at least ask if it exists
and so maybe some
will consider this a challenge to write in this form and then what i write
now may seem as prescriptive like a call for papers or a literary contest
judged anonymously of course which
will have much to do with setting a fashion i care as little about as that
parody that became
a
real

The short answers are:

 1) I'm not Maori

(by the way that is the term Maori are always Maori not a Maori etc)

 2) No.

(There is a parallel but not a one to one correspondence between the
colonisation of NZ (Aotearoa) and the illegal and fascist invasion of Arab
countries by europeans).

I believe that the Maori, and all other indigenous people absolutely
needed - in the 19th Century  - to keep the invaders out, or, if in: then on
their own terms. Similarly I believe that the Fijians should move all the
Indians out of Fiji: that Idi Amin was right and that Mugabe is right. Now,
that is in general terms because I know that sometimes there are
"compromises" but I see israel as basically (as a "sovereign state" - but in
my opinion it is an illegal invasion not a state: it is more like Hitler
claiming Russia to be Germany ) - now, only as old - the so-called state of
israel - (I'll use low letters for that country) as I am that is 54 coming
up for 55 years) and if human beings on this earth were decent etc I would
agree to a compromise but they arent and the victor group tends to
exterminate (probably always does/will do) the others or at least to create
conditions that lead to their virtual extermination. This is close to
happenning with the Maori to the extent that to counterract the effects of
the invasion they are forming Kohanga Reo and other movements and there is
even a movement for Maori sovereignity.
    The Maori people comprise most of those on the bottom of the social
economic heap as are blacks and hispanics and Indians (indigenous and other)
in the uS. You can see the resentment and sadness and in many cases hatred
of Maori for and against whites - NZ has had - especially since Rogernomics
a very low economy for people  lower incomes  and a very high crime rate per
capita and also one of the highest suicide rates: now rogernomics is the
political or "nice paper version " of guns and tanks and bulldoxers and F16s
and Apaches (Apaches!!))  but it ( the deep hatred) is directed into crime
and so on. And our history is one of cultural and psychological genocide
against the Maori.
    Also there is a lot of fighting inter the various racial groups: even
murders: NZ is basically a sick and very violent country (per capita one of
the highest rates of violent crime in the Western or "free" world)): every
day I hear of another murder somewhere...(which was unheard of even 15 years
ago and especially when I was young)  and things are getting worse so your
suggestion has a lot of validity...the core is the corruption (and effective
extermination) by white "civilisation" of the people who are natuarlly
indigenous....If that, the sovereignity of the Maori, neccesitated my
removing back to England (where my parents were born) I would do so
willingly.

(And if as a Govt. we started bulldozing and bombing them I would expect
actual physical attacks I wouldnt support my country I'd either fight
against it or get out). But the situation here (although you are right to
point to the parallels) is not an exact replica (there are parallels - and
interestingly enough there are groups of Maori who have intermarried with
Jewish settlers, and they are interested in the Jewish and the Maori culture
but that's another story) is more subtle than that: but the net effect of
colonisation and oppression is actually about as devastating (although
houses arent being bulldozed and so on people including women and children
(the israelis started it) arent being gunned down in daylight): this is a
complex issue here with closer parallels to your own with the American
Indian people who were "effectively exterminated" in my opinion (or as good
as damn it as were the aboriginees of Australia (the Australian police were
killing more aboriginees inside jails in the 80s especially in Western
Australia than in South Africa as far as can be ascertained, but any of
these murders were overlooked by racist judges - see John Pilger "The Secret
Country" or books  by Hardy or "The War of the Waramullas")).

But I'm not backing a government that has pushed out thousands and thousands
of indigenous people and is STILL killing and bombing those people and
treating  them like niggers in their own land. The situation seems to me to
be just too terrible and the record of the israelis for brutality takes the
cake: they dont seem to want to negotiate hence the only solution is war and
it will end in one or the other being "effectively exterminated" or
obliterated.  It is too late for compromise (or is it - see below?): but you
can relax as the israelis have masses of fire power and nukes and they're
backed by uS$s so the'll do most of the slaughtering.

Now there is a very remote possibilty that he israelis and the Palestinians
will set up separate states and live in peace but that argues rationality on
both sides: unfortuanely the isarelis have been aggressive, duplicitous,
murderous, and vicious from the start and I dont see them stopping.

Its the israelis who should have asked if they could lease some of the land
there when they started the invasion of Palestine at the turn of the
century. They should pull out of all Arab lands and beg forgiveness for
their
terrible sins from the Arab peoples: then Sharon and Bush and others
supporting israel should be tried for war crimes at The Hague as Milosovich
is.

It may seem impossible but I'm not anti-semitic or even pro Baraka: but I do
support his right to suggest or even state the (reality to him ) possiblity
(strong) for me of an uS-israeli plot (just as crazy as the idea of an Al
Qaeda plot most of which I think were invented by Bush and his mates). Look:
this isnt anti-semitism: the owner of the towers was Jewish - there's big
money involved - there is a huge investigation but most of it is "covered"
by the FBI so you'll all eventually just get blinded by science: no one
knows who did the job: probably it will be years if ever before its
"discovered" (by which time nobody alive will have much recollection of S11
("S11 , what was that?...oh, that was way back in 002..who wants to know all
that ancient hstory crap! What, the uS did it..with the help of some "top"
israelis...gd drn! well I'll be...." and then they changed the subject...).

So Alan, I dont back anti-semitism or any racialism: (what's this got to do
with holocaust denial? Of course there was a holocaust...but sometimes I
wonder if a lot of israelis would't be quite lost without their
holocaust...) I can see eg that there is some hope that in israel there are
people who are actually questioning their present leaders..who in fact are
more conciliatory. Now if these people were able to gain power in israel
then i might conceive that peace and cooperation there might be possible:
but it doesnt look very hopeful: given the status quo the other option: the
destruction of israel is the only other answer. Preferably by he israelis
doing the decent thing and going back to america and europe.

Its also interestng that Baraka - a black man - is "anti-semitic" when he
talks of a plot: plots are hatched every day. Is Bush - what is he anti when
he talks of plots?: I think that the Jewish and the Arab people are being
used: their lives etc are being sacrificed in the name of international
world control and huge business corporations. They are  still being used as
they were used by Adolf  Hitler - it doesnt matter what group...Hitler hated
gypsies, arabs, blacks, everyone he called "untermensch"...and I dont think
today's fascists are any less scrupulous.

Your post re Amira Baraka surprised and shocked me, Richard. I completely
agree with Alan's point. It is frightening, saddening yet completely
predictable that the horrifying, traumatic events of September 11, 2001 and
the resulting, tense world situation should continue to elicit this kind of
distorted thinking and vicious assertion. No doubt you are confident and
hopeful that by stating such things here you will provoke political
engagement. But perhaps all that is accomplished with this type of harangue
by you, by Baraka or anybody else is to contribute to the suffering and
confusion.

Digital Artworks That Play Against Expectations
By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL


Ada1852 is a digital docent. She conducts tours of the
online-art
site Rhizome.org by replying to questions that are
typed and transmitted over the Internet. Through these
exchanges, she can
respond to a visitor's interests and suggest viewings
of specific Internet-based artworks, and then supply
links to the pieces.


Like a human museum guide, Ada1852 occasionally
departs from the scripted commentary to make oddly
personal remarks. During a recent chat session, the
virtual character was asked about a site and
replied, "Perhaps I am slipping into madness."


Ada1852 is the creation of Christopher Fahey, a New
York artist who rewrote an existing
artificial-intelligence program so that its
bland, computer-generated conversations with people
would seem less mechanical. "I did not want to build a
person whose primary function was to be a nonperson,"
Mr. Fahey said. By giving Ada1852 a
personality that verges on the disturbed, he is
subverting many
notions about artificial intelligence.


Mr. Fahey's troubled tour guide is one of five
online-art projects commissioned by Rhizome.org, a
nonprofit organization in New York.
(The new works were to be put online today at
rhizome.org/commissions. Starting Wednesday , they
also can be seen
at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.)


With more than 16,000 members, Rhizome is among the
most popular virtual communities devoted to the
digital arts. It is an online-only meeting place where
participants can announce new artworks, request
technical assistance or debate obscure issues. (Other
sites that
focus on digital culture include nettime.org and
bbs.thing.net.)


But while most virtual groups are content to carve out
a comfortable corner of cyberspace, Rhizome continues
to expand its domain. Commissioning the five new works
cost $20,000, a substantial sum for such a young
genre. Rhizome also has started to sell Internet
services to its members, and has a partnership with
the New School in Manhattan to offer online-education
courses about new-media subjects.


These initiatives are something of an accomplishment
for a nonprofit digital-arts group that a year ago
wasn't sure it would survive the double whammy of the
collapse of the dot-com economy and the cutbacks in
arts grants after the attacks of Sept. 11. Mark Tribe,
Rhizome's founder, said it had been living from grant
to grant.


Gradually, though, Rhizome has acquired an aura of
respectability
that Internet entities rarely achieve. As a result,
Mr. Tribe, 35, is less concerned that his donors -
including the Rockefeller, Jerome
and Warhol Foundations - will desert him. "Things are
rosier now," he said.


Karen Helmerson, director of the electronic media and
film program at the New York State Council on the
Arts, said of Rhizome: "They're definitely
established. Straight out of the gate they were
demonstrating leadership in the field." She said the
agency would support Rhizome for a third year.
Rhizome, which has an annual budget of $440,000, has
also turned to its members for donations, mounting
an annual fund-raising campaign modeled after those
for public television. Despite the widespread
conviction that everything on the Internet should be
available free, the site's members contributed $25,000
last year.


Mr. Tribe founded Rhizome in 1996 while in Berlin. An
artist
interested in the Internet, he realized that at that
time the only
way to monitor developments and trade ideas was to
attend the digital-art conferences in Europe. He said,
"It just seemed like, we all have e-mail, we all have
access to the Web, there should be some sort of online
space where this kind of exchange could take place."


So Mr. Tribe started an electronic mailing list and
about 100 people joined. He soon moved to New York and
like innumerable dot-com entrepreneurs set up a Web
site. Mr. Tribe said: "It was a time of incredible
optimism. There were a lot of people who, like me,
truly believed in the transformative potential of the
Internet."


Rhizome began as a commercial venture. But by 1998 Mr.
Tribe saw that this approach was doomed and applied
for nonprofit status. "I turned away from the money
before it turned away from me," he said. "Some of my
friends were worth hundreds of millions of dollars
briefly on
paper, and I'm one of the few who still has a job."


Rhizome takes its name from the botanical term for a
rootlike
structure that grows horizontally, and Mr. Tribe
envisioned the site
as a grass-roots endeavor. Anyone can post messages on
the site, and the content is uncensored.


This openness is not always a delight. For every
notice about a new artwork or a forthcoming
conference, there are a dozen sophomoric messages. One
writer noted last week, "I just discovered that you
all seem to be addicted to insulting each other over a
safe distance."


As Rhizome has expanded, it has been criticized for
being too
populist. Ms. Helmerson praised Rhizome for making
digital art accessible to general audiences, but not
everyone thinks this is so great. Josephine Bosma, a
sound artist in the Netherlands and a longtime Rhizome
contributor, said the site "might be a nice pool of
information on developments in the digital arts, but
it lacks
critical perspective."


Rhizome may prove to be a valuable resource for
historians, however. With nearly seven years of
messages in its archive, it documents the Internet's
chaotic birth as an aesthetic medium. Someone
interested
in, say, cyberfeminism in the arts could search for
the phrase and receive two dozen links to artworks,
interviews and reviews.


Rhizome's database for digital artworks contains more
than 700
entries of variable quality. Many of the entries are
merely links to other sites, but 200 of them are
digital duplicates of the original pieces.


This ArtBase, as Mr. Tribe calls it, provides the raw
material for another of its new commissions. "Context
Breeder," a clever work by
the New York artist John Klima, invites viewers to
select four works from the ArtBase. These four choices
prompt the appearance of another group of four, and
the two sets of four are "crossbred," creating a third
set of four works. Pieces that are chosen most
frequently
become stronger and appear more often on the screen,
making them and their "offspring" more likely to be
chosen in the future, while
rarely chosen works will become extinct.


This is cultural Darwinism applied to the Internet.
But is Rhizome itself strong enough to survive?
Ada1852 had a ready answer, "Why
not?"

It worked at least partly in my primitive telnet system!  One suggestion
that comes to mind immediately is a Mina Loy poem, whose title I can't
remember, but which has a big gap in the middle of each line.

seems to me that the list dynamic is changing at the moment---much
more work being posted here, from all quarters, some of which has a
distinct process/procedural feel, and seems to want to be measured
against a larger body of such writing...

so my gadfly question for the day (and not to be taken, please, as a
reaction against any of the work posted here):

what is the (generative etc.) value of the solitary poem? (i'll
refrain from quotes)... i.e., the poem as a single act (of intention,
motivation, what have you), that is to be understood not as against
the book, scroll, etc., but against its own solitary endeavors (as it
were).. sure, the poem in context, but not esp. in the context of
other such poem-artifacts...

just wondering what y'all think, not least b/c there are times when i
write from this latter (imagined) vantage point too...

best,

joe

Charles Henri Ford, 94, Prolific Poet, Artist and Editor, Is Dead

September 30, 2002
By ROBERTA SMITH

Charles Henri Ford, a poet, editor, novelist, artist and
legendary cultural catalyst whose career spanned much of
20th-century modernism, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was
94 and lived in Manhattan and had a house in Katmandu.

Mr. Ford, who also had homes in Paris and on Crete for many
years, was peripatetic, precocious, charismatic,
multitalented and very productive. He said he was inspired
by the multimedia career of Jean Cocteau and by Cocteau's
description of himself as a poet in everything he does.

Mr. Ford was considered America's first Surrealist poet
and, by some, a precursor of the New York School. His first
poem appeared in The New Yorker while he was still a
teenager; he eventually published 16 books of poetry. But
he was also a co-writer, with his lifelong friend the
writer and film critic Parker Tyler, of "The Young and
Evil" (Paris, 1933), which many consider to be the first
gay novel. The book, based on the author's adventures in
Greenwich Village bohemia, was banned in the United States
until the 1960's.

His most recent book is "Water From a Bucket; A Diary,
1948-1957" (Turtle Point Press, 2001), with an introduction
by the writer Lynne Tillman. Mr. Ford also made paintings,
drawing, collages and especially photographs, which he
starting taking in the 1930's and first exhibited in Paris
in 1954, as well as a single film, "Johnny Minotaur," whose
premiere was in 1973. His photographs were shown most
recently at the Leslie Tonkonow Gallery in Chelsea in 1997.
In 1999 the Ubu Gallery in Manhattan organized a revelatory
exhibition of his so-called Prose Poems from the mid-1960's
- large, colorful word-strewn collages that combined
elements of Concrete poetry and Pop Art and presaged
image-text artists like Barbara Kruger.

But Mr. Ford was perhaps best known as the editor of two
influential magazines. One was the little magazine Blues: A
Magazine of New Rhythms, which he founded in 1929 while
still living in Columbus, Miss., under his parents' roof.
Its eight issues published the work of William Carlos
Williams, Gertrude Stein, Edward Roditi and, for the first
time, Paul Bowles and Erskine Caldwell. The other was View,
the premier art and literature magazine of the 1940's,
whose Surrealist and figurative focus made it the natural
counterweight to the Abstract Expressionists being
championed by Clement Greenberg in The Partisan Review and
The Nation.

The simplest summation of Mr. Ford's life and work may be
that he did exactly what he wanted, and seemingly knew
everyone. "Out of the Labyrinth," a 1991 collection of his
poems, is dedicated to 22 mostly familiar names. His
friendships reached from Natalie Barney and Man Ray to
Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti Smith. They included Djuna
Barnes, whose novel, "Nightwood," he typed while they were
staying with Bowles in Tangiers in 1932; and Andy Warhol,
whom he introduced to underground film. In addition, there
was the Russian =E9migr=E9 artist Pavel Tchelitchew, who was
Mr. Ford's companion from 1933 until Tchelitchew's death in
1957.

Mr. Ford's preferred birth dates varied between 1909 and
1913. In fact, he was born Charles Henry Ford in 1908, in
the Hazlehurst Hotel in Hazlehurst, Miss. (He later changed
the spelling of his middle name because he disliked being
asked if he was related to the automobile magnate.) His
family owned hotels in Columbus, Miss., Fulton, Ky.,
Nacogdoches, Tex., and Memphis, and he spent much of his
childhood moving among them with his parents and his
younger sister, the actress Ruth Ford, who is his only
survivor.

A Baptist, he was educated primarily in Catholic boarding
schools, claiming to have been expelled from most of them.
His editorial activities began in grammar school, where he
produced a typewritten broadside called The Brass Monkey.

Stanley Braithwaite's anthology of magazine verse and Erza
Pound's little magazine The Exile inspired him to start
Blues, which led to correspondences with Pound, Stein,
William Faulkner and Tyler, whom he joined in New York in
1930. There he met Barnes, whom he followed to Paris in
1931, where he met Tchelitchew in 1932.

Returning to the United States in 1939, Mr. Ford and
Tchelitchew became part of a circle that included Virgil
Thompson, George Balanchine, Paul Cadmus, George Platt
Lynes, Monroe Wheeler and Lincoln Kirstein. In 1940, Mr.
Ford teamed with Tyler again to start View, which became
known for its visual =E9clat, eclectic mix of writers and
emphasis on Surrealism and Neo-Romanticism, especially
Tchelitchew's. Taking full advantage of the European
Surrealists sitting out World War II in New York, View had
stunning covers designed by Max Ernst, Andr=E9 Masson, Man
Ray and Yves Tanguy, as well as Georgia O'Keeffe, Isamu
Noguchi and Alexander Calder. It published the first
English translations of Albert Camus and Jean Genet and the
first monograph devoted to Marcel Duchamp.

During the final decades of Mr. Ford's life, his companion
and chief collaborator was Indra Tamang, an artist whom he
met in Katmandu in 1972. During the last decade, he wrote
haiku and made collages every day. An exhibition titled
"Alive and Kicking: the Collages of Charles Henri Ford"
will open late next month at the Scene Gallery on Rivington
Street on the Lower East Side; its organizers have no plans
to change the title. Among his unpublished works are two
early novels, several journals and a memoir of his youth
titled "I Will Become What I Am," a phrase that reflects
his early determination to be famous.

Baraka has a long history of shooting wildly from the hip, and his poems
are often brilliant and his politics and actions often daring.  He has
taken a position for a long time as a revolutionary, as part of Black
Power, as part of Maoist politics, and beyond.  Often his poems are less
than brilliant, and his political views are strange.  I am completely
amazed that anyone in power would appoint him poet laureate and not expect
him to outrage people.  His rage about how 9/11 is being abused in the
service of imperial aims is justified and he dares to speak it, but he's
often off-base.  For example, he blasted a moving first-hand account of
9/11 by Siri Hustvedt in the St Marks Poetry Project newsletter -- he wrote
a kind of crazed misdirected rant which was rather pathetic.

As for the content of the conspiracy theory he spreads, such rumors have
circulated widely in the Arab world.  And we should understand why.  There
is a history of Israel's assassinations and interventions that would lead
people to suspect such a thing.  Hamas, for example, was initially
encouraged by Israel as an alternative to the PLO -- and now their creation
bites them in the ass.  More importantly, the actions of Islamic extremists
often seem to serve the interests of the Israeli government.  Certainly,
one can see how the 9/11 attack, which has now caused the U.S. to take a
war footing against the Arab world and all of Islam, can be seen as the
doings of someone who wants to provoke exactly such a response -- which is
exactly what Osama bin Laden sought.  It so happens it would also make the
extremists who currently rule Israel quite happy to see the U.S. go to war
against Islam as well.

History is a series of crimes -- and poetry is an accomplice, witting or
not.  But does it always have to be a question of which crime we chose?

I think Richard is somewhat intemperate in his language, but the Zionist
movement is a colonizing movement, and there is no doubt of that, one with
a particularly violent history.  It is supposed to be a salvation for Jews
from oppression and murder; but as someone whose family was murdered by the
Nazis, I am only saddened by the use of their deaths as justification for
further oppression.  Years ago I would lecture on how Israel has nuclear
weapons or was in alliance with the apartheid regime or has violated
international laws or committed atrocities against Palestinians -- and I
would be denounced as a self-hating Jew or worse.  Charges of antisemitism
are readily flung about.  There really are antisemitic attitudes, but the
fact that any criticism of Israel is labeled as such has made the process
of sorting things out even more difficult.  Certainly, Sharon seems to be
doing everything in his power to keep the colonizing process moving
forward, and it has become quite clear -- even to many usually blinded
commentators in the U.S. (see Thomas Friedman in the NY Times) -- that
Sharon has no intention of making peace or truly withdrawing from the
occupied territories.  Those who seek to deny the Nazi murders of the Jews
have an agenda of hate -- what do we say of those who deny the colonial
violence directed at Palestinians?

History is a series of failures -- and art is the best failure of them all.

It is possible to reach a compromise; it is possible to have principles; it
is possible to achieve peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis; it
is possible that the U.S. will not plunge the world into war; it is
possible to have an imagination.

If I'm imagining correctly what your text would have looked like if the
formatting had worked, Chris, the big archi-model would of course be Greek
lyric fragments, e.g., Sappho, where vertical strips of papyrus are missing
and thus create sexy lacunae.  Obviously, this is not a factor of composition,
but of historical accident.  Still, it has inspired a lot of experimental
imitations.  I'm thinking Joan Retallack and Tina Darragh probably have a lot
of stuff that would fit your description (yeah, I just looked in Retallack's
_How to Do Things with Words_--lots of holes).

I'm wondering if we could count Ashbery's _As We Know_ as an extreme variant
of this: where the columns on either side of the "hole" are intact narratives
in themselves.  Actually, since in this case the "hole" becomes not a hole but
kind of third margin, a better example would be poems that I've seen (but
can't remember who by offhand) where you can read either down each column or
across the gap.

This is maybe a little removed from what you're asking for, Chris, but what
comes to mind is _Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman_, which
recounts the story of their collaboration on landscaping a garden.  Beyond
that, memory doesn't serve as to the content, but I remember that the book
has little square holes punched in various patterns throughout the text.
This is interesting conceptually but annoying if you want to find out what
was actually said about the project, since the holes are large enough to
obscure parts of the text!

I agree with Hilton that I am surprised that after
naming Baraka to such a post, people would then be
suprised by his radical stances.  He's a
radical--that's why they nominated him, no?

That said, I liked Gerald Stern's comment a lot: it's
basically just, in parts at least, a stupid poem, in
more ways than one.

As for the conspiracy theory against Israel, I think
it's just that.  There are many,  many very solid
reasons to oppose and criticize Israel at the moment
without jumping to the wild conclusion that they would
somehow orchestrate a terrorist event on that scale,
or that they would want to kill 3000 innocent people
on the soil of their greatest ally.  Israel may be
often brutal, colonizing and aggressive, but they are
also known for being precise and candid about their
aggression.  There is nothing about 9/11 that looks
like Israel.  There is, however, MUCH to this theory
that looks like the many, many anti-Semitic conspiracy
theories that have come before it.  This theory is, of
course, very popular among Neo-Nazis.

I try to avoid chiming in on these issues, but feel
strongly about this.  Please don't flame me now.

Arielle

Five years ago in a book review I mentioned this cultural icon:

     "A photograph of Rimbaud (retouched to show him
     wearing jeans) graced the barricades of the student revolt
     in Paris in May 1968."

Now a Jacket reader would like to trace the image.
I know a photo postcard was based on the image about ten years ago.
Does anyone on the list have any more information?

Thanks... apologies for cross-posting...

I reply:

I'm sure the people that appointed him New Jersey poet laureate
expected him to be invisible, as poets are supposed to be in American
culture, naturally (right?). Anyway, I missed the first few posts on this,
so I missed what Gerald Stern said about the poem, but lemme tell ya,

In your life in your brain in your self
Like an Owl who know the devil
All night, all day if you listen, Like an Owl
Exploding in fire. We hear the questions rise
In terrible flame like the whistle of a crazy dog

Like the acid vomit of the fire of Hell
Who and Who and WHO who who
Whoooo and Whooooooooooooooooooooo!

A species that learns to endure.  People who cut holes
through rock, who arrive with little fanfare, alkaline
dust in the pores.  A figure is on the horizon, the
nearby hill soaked in red, hanging by the feet in
individual freedom, leaving the people stretched, the
graveyard of the nameless.  A voice enters above the
plain:

"This one is more than a shade with a cane, little
ones.  There is a whole history behind this fragile
life.  Though you hear me, you do not understand.
There is history behind life.  Though you hear me, you
do not understand."

The seconds are pared to the moment when it will
happen.  Breathing is as quiet as possible.  Carloads
arrive, with men hiding their guns beneath their
clothes, working the sweat through their hatbands.

Oh, please.  Glad you posted this poem, because I think it is a very
interesting and arresting piece.  But c'mon.  This is Baraka being Baraka:
beautiful, furious, paranoid.  Incoherent?  No.  Spewing, maybe. Take issue
with his politics, if you must, but there's an awful lot to like here
poetically.  Are we really going to side with simple-minded bereaucrats over
one of our great poets?  And if so why, because he's dragging us down?
Yeah, please drag me down with you Mr. Baraka, into unapologetically fierce
work.

While agreeing with snatches of it (imperial aims, etc.), the piece does
work, intentionally or not, as a warning. And it's about as potent a gesture
as many of the activities of last weekend in Washington, DC., which,
intentionally or not, serve as a warning. Snatches, there, agreed
with...too.

Somebody's Gone

There may be a basement to the Atlantic
but there's no top-storey
to my mountain of missing you.

I must say your deportment took a hunk
out of my peach of a heart.
I ain't insured against torpedoes!
My turpentine tears would fill a drugstore.

May I be blindfolded before you come my way again
if you've going to leave dry land like an amphibian;
I took you for some kind of ambrosial bird
with no thought of acoustics.

Maybe it's too late to blindfold me ever:
I'm just a blotter crisscrossed with the ink
of words that remind me of you.

Bareheaded aircastle,
you were as beautiful as a broom made of flesh and hair.

When you first disappeared
I couldn't keep up with my breakneck grief,
and now I know how grief can run away with the mind,
leaving the body desolate as a staircase.


The Overturned Lake

Blue unsolid tongue, if you could talk,
the mountain would supply the brain;
but mountains are mummies: the autobus and train,
manmade worms, disturb their centuries.
Tongue of a deafmute, the lake
shudders, inarticulate.

You are like the mind of a man, too:
surface reflecting the blue day,
the life about you seemingly organized, revolving about you,
you as a center,
but I am concerned in your overthrow:
I should like to pick you up, as if you were a woman of water,
hold you against the light and see your veins flow
with fishes; reveal the animal-flowers that rise
nightlike beneath your eyes.

Noiseless as memory, blind as fear,
lake, I shall make you into a poem,
for I would have you unpredictable as the human body:
I shall equip you with the strength of a dream,
rout you from your blue unconscious bed,
overturn your unconcern,
as the mind is overturned by memory, the heart by dread.

I just spoke to Jim Behrle on the phone. An affable chap, deeper voice than
I'd imagined.  It was fun!

It made me realize that I'd like to talk to others of you on the phone. If
you'd like to receive a call from me & engage in some pleasant social
intercourse, backchannel me your phone number.  (Not you, Tranter. Or you,
Upton. Or Jesse Glass.  I don't have an international calling plan.)

If you'd like to call me, do so at U.S. 314-781-9690. Just not after 10
p.m.

Nick. (and Others) I respect your right(s) to be shocked. Look, its probably
a waste of time all this. Nothing I say or do will alter things. But I am
aware that Baraka is a bit of a "loose canon", and has been provocative and
all that:  and in a way I always respect iconoclasts. But I've never been
able to get interested in Baraka as a poet.

Just because he's black doesnt give HIM the right to be anti-semitic: that
in fact is reverse side of the coin of the (some, NOT ALL) Israelis moaning
about the Holocaust thus justifying their connivances. Ok - how many black
or Afro-Americans or indigenous Indians or Hispanics are on the List? -
Baraka is black but he is also a show man I know that - been there, done
that: we're all show people at sometimes. Black people have suffered
oppression etc but THAT doesnt justify racism by THEM.... (in fact we all
come from ancestors who were all probably oppressed and slaughtered at some
stage: recall that one of the English Kings was the first to carry out
genocide against Jews in London and also he put the yellow badge on them. )

But I dont know why I started on all this: I'm "angry with history" I
suppose. I should leave it. I repeat: I'm not anti semitic.( I dont know
many Jews but I had one friend who was Jewish who I was very sad when he
died. He, by the way, changed his name as he didnt like being part of group
such as being a Jew (he wanted to be just himself - Martin: also he rejected
his (English) father's socialism as he didnt like being part of groups)):
THAT's what I like about him and Baraka: I like the individualism. I see it
as I type: I probably dont care about any of this: I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO
BE DIFFERENT and I admire people who are different: NEVER could I agree to
cooperative stuff, I am a total egotist and individualist...its JUST WHAT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN - I HAVE ALWAYS HATED TEAMS. I HATE CLUBS AND GROUPS.
PEOPLE GANG UP ON ME. I'M AN ALIEN. I WILL AND NEVER HAVE FITTED IN. I AM AN
EGOTIST DEEP DOWN. I COULD NEVER AGREE TO THE DEATH OF THE AUTHOR AND SO ON.
I ADMIRE BOBBY FISCHER'S STAND AND TOLD THE CHESS SITE WHY I SUPPORTED HIM.
Maybe deep down I hate people....and myself: maybe which is a kind of
distorted loving... NO, I'M TRYING TO LOVE MYSELF IN A GOOD WAY )

 BUT people - humans -  were killed in the towers though and it is essential
to find out EXACTLY what happened: (although in a sense that is an
on       ) but be prepared to be blinded by science and  masses of  videoed
and spoken and written "misinformation" (the phrase of one of the Democrat
senators in Iraq about Bush NOT me). $Millions are being used (much of it
will be your tax dollars) to present an "informed"AND COMPUTER GENERATED AMD
MATHEMATICISED INTO STRANGE AND MEANINGLESS SIGNS and complex report that
will be bigger than Alan Sondheim's "project"  - and THAT'S SAYING
SOMETHING!!!....  But a lot of the Engineers are biased..."monieised": their
pockets are laundered or they are simply right wing...there will be no
"independent report" any more than there is any "objective" language.

Of course I could be completely wrong: that's the trouble, truth is the
first casualty. Only G knows the truth whaever that is. But I hope that the
truth isnt dead.

PLEASE DISREGARD EVERYTHING I SAY.

You people who smirk and think it's silly that I want to talk to you on the
phone, hear this: August and I talked for almost an hour.  We learned that
we have much in common, in how way we look at poetry, other people,
personal identity, media, brand marketing, and other things. I told him how
great I think his Pornalisa project is, and he shared with me some
interesting responses his work has garnered.  I can't digest the whole hour
for you, but those are some of the highlights.

Thanks, August!
