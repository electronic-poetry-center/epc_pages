*Eco-poetics Workshop* with *Jack Collom* Saturday, June 6, 2-5pm $25
includes ticket to 7pm reading

To me, Humor and Nature are one, or maybe one and a half. Nature is
everything and everything is funny. Case closed. Incongruity donut, I mean
done it. We'll look into some old shell games (like which is funnier,
skeletons or people? trees without leaves or trees with leaves?) but mostly
we'll make our own via tradeoff poems, trying to write something that isn't
funny, and other doomed enterprises. We'll also woodpecker a little surreal.

*Jack Collom* was born in Chicago, Illinois, 8 November 1931, and grew up in
nearby Western Springs. He walked a lot in Salt Creek Woods and began bird
watching at age 11. He joined the U.S. Air Force and wrote his first poems
in Tripoli, Libya. After spending time in Germany, he returned to the U.S.
and worked in factories for twenty years. He has four grown children and is
married to the writer Jennifer Heath.

He earned an MA in English on the GI Bill, and has taught Creative Writing
free-lance for over thirty years. He is Adjunct Professor at Naropa
University, where he received the 2001 President's Award for Faculty and has
been teaching Eco-lit (Ecology Literature) for 19 consecutive years, as well
as outreach teacher-training.

Collom has authored 22 books and chapbooks of poetry. He is, moreover,
responsible for three collections (with essays and commentary) of writings
by children, all published by Teachers & Writers Collaborative, New York. In
2001, Tuumba Press issued a more than 500-page-long volume, *Red Car Goes By
*, as his *Selected Poems*. His latest books are *Exchanges of Earth & Sky*and
*Situations, Sings* (with Lyn Hejinian).

Jack Collom long ago rejected the notion that a distinction is to be made
between the quotidian and the poetic. There is poetry everywhere. But to
find poetry everywhere means that one is incessantly engaged with the world
at the level of poetry... His attention to surprise is pronounced but never
programmatic. The result is (as Merrill Gilfillan has phrased it) "the dance
and weave between fierce notation and ceilingless song." from Editors'
Preface to *Red Car Goes By*

Charles,=0A=0AThis seems right to me, the distinction of McLow, etc. as bei=

 category as well, among many others. Aleatorical methods are not to be con=
fused with Improvisational ones and I think that has a lot in common with t=

ect: Re: What is Open?=0A=0AAlso, I think Duncan and Olson thought the poem=
 was not a "closed" system, i.e. it was open to what is "not" the poem, so =
that a poem didn't need to feel "finished" and set apart, so that one might=
 think of the field as encompassing more than the single poem, even more th=
an the single poet, a field of relations in which any single poem is partia=
l. I think Blaser touches on this in the quote Paul brings forth here, abou=
t where the poem takes the reader, where it takes the poet. I'm not quite s=
o comfortable with "organic" only in that I'm not sure how that might fit w=
ith the use of various procedures (a la Mac Low), which I think can (but do=
n't necessarily always) partake of "open" poetry as well. "Organic" as I mi=
ght understand it would apply various sorts of natural progressions in the =
poem, and I don't think that "natural" is the only way for the poem to move=
 openly. But quite possibly Blaser had no such sense of "organic" as I do.=

Hi folks - this is just to remind you all that from 7 until 10 on thursday, June 11 the 9th Big CLWN WR Event will be unfolding at the SAFE-T Gallery in the D.U.M.B.O. ("down under Manhattan Bridge overpass") section of Brooklyn

the information follows below, but first a word about Onomatomania, the group show that will be filling the walls of SAFE-T Gallery during June and July with some exciting work that explores the repetitive, obsessive, and compulsive involvement of visual artists with words - i'll have seven collages in the show - six of them are brand new (and quite different from what you've seen me do in the past) - for all the information on the show (plus a reproduction of a work by each of the artists) follow the link below:

http://www.safetgallery.com/Onomatomania/OnomatoWriteup.html

there will be an opening celebration for Onomatomania this thursday, June 4, between 6 and 8 at the Gallery (and if you want to make it a gallery evening there will be openings as well at 3 or 4 of the other galleries that share the building) - the show will be up until July 18, so if you wish you can wait and view the show on thursday, June 11, at the

9th Big CLWN WR Event which will feature readings and performances by Holly Anderson, Joel Chace, R. Nemo Hill, Sheila Lanham, Katrinka Moore, Jane Ormerod, Carolyn Ota, Adriana Scopino, Elizabeth Smith, Moira T. Smith, Phyllis Wat and Nathan Whiting

plus there will be an exciting special guest as well - the extremely talented coloratura soprano Patricia Sonego will be performing several early baroque songs accompanied by Michael Eisenberg on lap harp - Patricia is a wonderful performer who i never tire of hearing (i've heard her over a dozen times!!) - most recently i had the pleasure several nights ago of hearing her rehearsing with Michael the pieces she'll be performing on the 11th - i think it's safe to say that if you attend you'll be in for a memorable experience - if you want to read more about Patricia check out her website at www.patriciasonego.com

SAFE-T GALLERY is located at 111 Front Street, Gallery 214, in the D.U.M.B.O. section of Brooklyn (take the "F" train to York Street, walk downhill to Front St. and turn left under the Manhattan Bridge - for more information, maps, and directions from other subway lines go to the Gallery's website at http://www.safetgallery.com)
admission is free and everyone who attends will receive a copy of the latest issue of CLWN WR
hope to see you all soon
- Bob

Dear Fellow Listservees and Listserved,

I'm teaching a class on New York City in Fiction in the fall and wanted to
hear your suggestions for supplemental reading. I have a few in mind
(Invisible Man, New York Trilogy, etc), but I'm looking for more. Length
isn't a concern: 50 or 500 pages, they'll read it.

I'd greatly appreciate suggestions.

Thanks!

Best,

Ryan Daley

*SoundEye Festival of the Arts of the Word
8-12 July, 2009
Cork, Ireland*

Participants include:

Christine Wertheim
David Toms
Fergal Gaynor
Frances Kruk
Geoff Squires
Jaap Blonk
James Cummins
Jerome Rothenberg
Jim Goar
Keith Tuma
Keston Sutherland

Louis Armand
Maggie O'Sullivan
Mair=E9ad Byrne
Marcus Slease
Michael Smith
Peter Manson
Sean Bonney
Swantjia Lichtenstein
Tom Raworth
& others in readings, and the SoundEye Cabaret

"Without question it is the most innovative and most important literary
gathering to take place in Ireland - or just about anywhere else - over the
last decade". - Charles Bernstein (2005)

"One of the most important ongoing poetry festivals in the Anglophone poetr=
y
world. . . . This is the festival poetry scholars of the future will be
writing about." - Marjorie Perloff

"Our affiliation has provided UbuWeb with new content focused on the rich
terrain of Irish and British poetry and poetics. The partnership works both
ways: for our audience, SoundEye is Ireland''s most important literary
festival." - Kenneth Goldsmith

+++

This year SoundEye will take place in the context of:

*The Avant: Ten Days of the Progressive Arts

July 3-12 in Cork, Ireland*


Go see their website at http://theavant.wordpress.com/

Where you can read Fergal Gaynor's account of the origins of the idea . . .

"In 2008 experimental composer Alvin Lucier bumped into Ubuweb founder and
conceptual writer Kenny Goldsmith on a street in Cork. Completely surprised=
,
each wondered what the other was doing in this provincial city on the other
side of the Atlantic. Apparently, SoundEye Festival of the Arts of the Word=
,
in which Goldsmith was participating, was on at the same time as The Quiet
Music Festival, which featured Lucier. So Kenny attended as much of the
music festival as he could, and took me aside one evening for a chat.

Kenny is a can-do kind of guy: "you've got these two great festivals here i=
n
Cork, why don't you talk to each other and co-ordinate the programmes? I'm
sure lots of people in SoundEye would like to go to Quiet Music stuff and
vice versa."

The irony of Kenny's chance encounter wasn't lost on me, but I'd been so
busy with SoundEye in the preceding months that I simply hadn't surfaced
sufficiently to be aware of what was happening in the city apart from the
poetry festival. Soon afterwards Mick O'Shea informed me that it was
unlikely that a Quiet Music Festival would take place in Cork in 2009. But
neither fact mattered: Kenny had sown a seed.

And once I managed to look around it was clear that these two summer
festivals weren't the only things happening in the city. After what had fel=
t
like a hangover period in the wake of 2005 and the European Capital of
Culture Year signs of renewed energy had begun to appear: the opening of
artist-run galleries like the Black Mariah and Couch; a host of sound art
and improvisation events; film nights run in the National Sculpture Factory
and the Sl=E1inte Bar; regular events at the Glucksman, including Ed Kr=E8m=
a's
Eye and Mind series of discussions. What was evident in all of these
enterprises was a taste for the avant-garde: it could almost be said that
Cork was becoming a centre for avant-garde art. All that was needed was som=
e
of Kenny's co-ordination.

The Avant is a simple idea: ask a number of Cork-based organisations,
supportive of avant-garde practices, to schedule events which they would
programme in any case, in a limited period (9 days) in the summer. Pool
their resources in terms of audience and publicity, but in all other matter=
s
let them run their events independently. Voil=E1, with no extra funding, an=
d
little extra effort, a festival of experimental and pioneering art in Cork
city, worthy of national, if not international attention. Hopefully that is
what will happen, and hopefully the public interested in hearing sonic
improvisation in the Crawford Gallery will be willing to try out conceptual
writing at SoundEye; the SoundEye poets will be found scrutinising the
artworks at the Black Mariah; the art lovers will find their way to the
SoundEye cabaret, and the music lovers there will give Sonic Vigil a chance=
.
And hopefully from all of this - new ideas, new publics and new
collaborations.

The Avant won't be perfect: I'm not a waged arts administrator, so
organising this means that I'm again immersed, unable to take in what's
happening outside of my little sphere of business. The organisations
involved in The Avant are associated with individuals I meet regularly:
there are certainly a number of other vibrant groups whom I don't often com=
e
into contact with, and who have therefore fallen outside the range of my
organisational activity, but might very well wish to be involved. On the
other hand there is a strength in this kind of more personal practice: it
means that The Avant is based on ongoing conversations, and conversation, t=
o
my mind, is the soul of culture. With any luck the 'festival' itself will
draw new people into the conversation, just as it will reshape that same
conversation, leading to wider and deeper urban activity in the wake of Jul=
y
2009."

So, come see us in Cork, early July!

Best to all,

Trevor

Career and Applied Studies.

Robert Thompson's poems have many admirable qualities, chief among them:
a light touch. A light touch is only admirable when it goes against the
grain, when it is something more than willful fun 'n games, or mere
whimsy, when it undermines solemnity without sacrificing attention.


Born in Nashua, NH, USA, Donald Wellman attended University of New
Hampshire, served in the US Army(1968-71), and completed a Doctor Arts
at the University of Oregon in 1975 (concentrations in Old English,

Humanities at Daniel Webster College. From 1981 to 1995, Wellman
directed O.ARS, a literary and cultural organization, publishing
anthologies of poetry, visual poetry, experimental prose, and
commentary. Each volume explores an aspect of postmodern poetics. From
its inception O.ARS published works of experimental or sur-fiction,
visual poetry and other forms of writing associated with the
international avant-garde, as well as what has come now to be known as
language writing.

Wellman’s poetry and criticism have appeared in a variety of venues,
including the on-line journal Jacket. An e-book entitled Baroque Threads
has been published by Mudlark. Fields . a selected poems, spanning
twenty years work, appeared in 1995 from Light & Dust. Wellman has given
conference papers and published criticism on key modernist poets such as
Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson. He has also
written and published on contemporary world poetry, especially that
employing hybrid forms. In both his poetry and prose, Wellman engages a
field poetics, using tropes like margin, frame or overlay to explore the
ways in which cross-cultural contact or liminality produce meaning. He
has translated contemporary poetry from French, German and Spanish
sources. Current translation projects include Jardín cerrado by Emilio
Prados and several works by Antonio Gamoneda, 2006 winner of the
Cervantes prize. His translation of Gamoneda’s Book of the Cold is
forthcoming from Swan Isle.

Hi Amy, I was a writer for Teachers and Writers Collaborative many years
ago. During the summers I also taught creative writing at a day camp, Usdan,
the Center for Performing Arts in Huntington. Right now they are looking for
a person to teach creative writing at camp. If you know someone who might be
interested please have them contact Andrew Copper at ACopper@Usdan.com. A
teaching writer would be perfect for this summer gig. Thanks.

Writing here to ask for contributions, and for contributing editors, to the
next issue of *Celery Flute: The Kenneth Patchen Newsletter*, which will
focus on the visual poetry (officially known as "picture-poems") of a
unique, late-modern American poet/artist.  Jim Woodring calls Patchen's
works of 1954-1972 "drawings *of* words," because "the way they are drawn
determines the way they affect our minds".

With the recent re-publication of seven of Patchen's books of picture-poems
in two new volumes (*We Meet *and *The Walking-Away World*), a reasonably
complete "collected poetry" is now available alongside the *Collected Poems*
*of Kenneth Patchen*, which was published thirty years earlier, in 1968.

Woodring again:  "He can make his phrases flow like trickles of mercury or
stick like a bone in the throat."

The intent of the forthcoming summer issue of *Celery Flute* is to provide a
productively critical tension in current poetics by way of essays and
commentary focusing on Patchen's visual poetry and his influence on poets,
musicians and artists.

Possible themes include:  the contemporary context of visual art and poetry
(intermedia) in relation to Patchen's aesthetic, as well as the literary
historical issues surrounding his publications and critical reception.

I'd also like to announce that a new issue of *Celery Flute* has just been
printed, which focuses on the "performance" of Patchen's poems in Jazz and
Pop contexts, as well as a production of his play *Don't Look Now*.  The new
issue also features tribute essays, a recap of the '07 Patchen-Fest in
Cleveland, OH, and reviews of small press titles and chapbooks.

email  (inksaudible@gmail.com) or write to me for a copy ($9 ppd) of the
magazine, or to send your work for consideration:

Celery Flute
82 Livingston St. #2
Buffalo, NY 14213

After this limited-run issue sells out, and with the help and assistance
from as-yet unknown, interested web developers, the magazine will be
available in .pdf formats on a website dedicated to the magazine, and to my
"micro" press, little scratch pad.


Once again, please send your critical works, poetic collisions, editorial
contributions and/or other media to this email address or to our office
address for consideration by June 30, 2009.

Thank you!!

I am seeking contact information for whomever may be involved with the
literary estate of V. R. "Bunny" Lang, founding member of the Cabridge
Poets Theater in the 50s, friend and inspiration to Frank O'Hara, among
others. On behalf of the press Kenning Editions, I seek to acquire
permission to reprint a work by Lang in a major forthcoming anthology of
Poets Theater. Her husband Bradley Phillips controlled the estate until
his death. It is known that he has a sister, Sarah Phillips, who may
still live in the Boston area. Lang biographer Alison Lurie suggested
that Sarah was a Radcliffe graduate, but the name is not on file with
the Alumni Association at Harvard. Although Lurie has given the reprint
her blessing, she does not in fact control the estate. Lang's papers,
donated by Lurie, are held by the Harvard Libraries' American Theater
Collection, though the library has no leads in this matter. It seems
that only the Phillips family would now know who does. Any information
you can provide in this regard would be greatly appreciated. Please back
channel kenningeditions@gmail.com and/or spread the word.

ED SANDERS : GLYPHS 1962-2009

A rare exhibition of nearly half a century of Ed Sanders?s glyph-poems
produced between 1962 and 2009 will be on display at The Arm in Williamsbur=
g
[Brooklyn, NY] from July 10 through July 31. An opening reception will be
held on July 10th at 6PM.

Building on a long history of utilizing a highly visible language that
continues into the present, Sanders?s glyph-poems fuse image with text, and
image as text. Political, personal, ephemeral, historical, uncanny, and
humorous=A1=AAthe glyph-poems on display at The Arm appear in several different
mediums, including original drawings, collages, mimeographed pages from Fuc=
k
You/ A Magazine of the Arts (1962-'65), plus a number featuring color
images, and an artist?s book. Over 200 Glyph-works will be featured in the
show.

In addition, Glyphs 1962-2009 will feature new letterpress prints and a
limited edition catalogue produced on location at The Arm.

Edward Sanders is a poet, historian and musician. He is at work, since 1998=
,
on a 9-volume America, a History in Verse. The first five volumes, tracing
the history of the 20th century, have been completed and published in a
fully indexed CD format, over 2,000 pages in length, by Blake Route Press.
Another recent writing project is Poems for New Orleans, a book and CD on
the history of that great city, and its tribulations during and after
hurricane Katrina. He has been granted a Guggenheim fellowship in poetry, a
National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in verse, an American Book Award
for his collected poems, and other awards for his writing. Other books in
print include Tales of Beatnik Glory (4 volumes published in a single
edition), 1968, a History in Verse; The Poetry and Life of Allen Ginsberg,
The Family, a history of the Charles Manson murder group, and Chekhov, a
biography in verse of Anton Chekhov.

Sanders was the founder of the satiric folk/rock group, The Fugs, which has
released many albums and CDs during its 45 year history. The Fugs have
recently completed a CD, Be Free, The Fugs Final CD (Part 2), featuring 14
new tunes. Be Free will be released in late summer. Two of Sanders' books,
The Family and Tales of Beatnik Glory, are under option to be made into
movies. His selected poems, 1986-2008, Let?s Not Keep Fighting the Trojan
War will be published by Coffee House Press in the fall of 2009. He lives i=
n
Woodstock, New York with his wife, the essayist and painter Miriam Sanders,
and both are active in environmental and other social issues. Sanders will
perform a section of America, the 17th Century, tracing the voyage of Henry
Hudson up the Hudson River in 1609, at the Byrdcliffe Art Colony in
Woodstock on August 8, as part of the 400th anniversary celebration of
Hudson?s discoveries.

Opening reception for Glyphs 1962-2009 on Friday, July 10th from 6PM.

Colson Whitehead's The Intuitionist is very teachable (and you can also assign bits of his The Colossus of New York, which is nonfiction), also Jonathan Lethem's Motherless Brooklyn.

Dear Fellow Listservees and Listserved,

I'm teaching a class on New York City in Fiction in the fall and wanted to
hear your suggestions for supplemental reading. I have a few in mind
(Invisible Man, New York Trilogy, etc), but I'm looking for more. Length
isn't a concern: 50 or 500 pages, they'll read it.

I'd greatly appreciate suggestions.

Thanks!

So that I no one else feels the need to correct my enthusiastic misreading =
of the request for fiction, here's what happened. First, I am so sorry that=
 I misread that request for New York in Fiction (my eyes not as good as the=
y once were); however, I read Ryan's message as a request from someone teac=
hing IN New York ON Fiction" ...I love to share my love of books with other=
s, so I just jumped in named all my contemporary lit favorites without real=
izing Ryan wanted only fiction about New York, written with New York as Set=
ting, New York as Character, New York New York --what a beautiful place!=A0=
 So on one else is required for whatever reason to give me a heads up. I go=
t it. Thank you.=20

SITE-BASED PRACTICES
a workshop led by David Buuck & Jessica Tully
Marin Headlands Bunkers
Sunday June 21, 11am-2pm
co-sponsored by the Headlands Center for the Arts

Please join writer David Buuck and artist Jessica Tully for a site-specific
workshop at the former military bunkers in the Marin Headlands. We will
explore a wide range of methods and practices related to site-based writing
and art practices, including several on-site exercises and experiments. This
workshop is designed for ALL levels of interested writers and artists, to
explore how we engage place, site, environment and the political histories
therein as writers, artists, and citizens.  We will discuss and explore
writing and research techniques as well as much more performative and
embodied strategies of site-work, so be prepared to try new ways of
thinking, moving, and working!

David Buuck is an alumni artist in residence this June at Headlands Center
for the Arts. He is contributing editor at Artweek, and teaches at the San
Francisco Art Institute. Recent publications include The Shunt (Palm
Press)and Buried Treasure Island, a guidebook printed in conjunction with an
installation and audio-tour by Barge (the Bay Area Research Group in
Enviro-aesthetics).

Jessica Tully is a conceptual artist working at the intersection of culture
and politics.  From hip-hop water ballet to a rock opera of live
construction equipment to voter education drives, her site-specific
performances, videos, drawings and campaigns are set within socially charged
public spaces.  In 2008 she debuted a new stencil series and walking tour
entitled Syndicate commissioned by Yerba Buena Center for the Arts for the
Bay Area Now 5 triennial exhibition.

Note: We will meet at the Headlands Center Dining Hall at 11 for
introductory remarks and head out from there. We will arrange for
car-pooling to the site for those who need it. There will be optional
pre-workshop readings. Bring notebook, camera, sunscreen and/or hat, outdoor
shoes, layers for cold, etc. The Marin Headlands is home to several former
military installations, including the bunkers, the Nike Missile Site, and
the current home of the Headlands Center for the Arts.
$40 general public / $30 students and members of Headlands Center for the
Arts and/or Small Press Traffic.
Class is limited to 20 participants.

NYTimes: Chen Guan: Tiananmen Square Scars Soldier Turned Artistþ





http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/world/asia/04soldier.html?th&emc=th
very amazing article with links and video etc
it's always amazed me the quasi-sentimentality  of the "good feelings" of the "unknown" lone man facing down a tank in the name of democracy
compared to the emotions that immediately churn forth if the lone man is replaced by a Palestinian child with a rock and slingshot staring down an Israel tank. rockets' red gale, bombs bursting in air, white phosphorus raining down illegally--today's David taking on Goliath--
if one thinks about the immediacy of the reflexive thoughts whiich each image stirs and the perhaps or not gulf between them--
isn't it a sign of the Pavlovian response that is generated by a socio-cultural training
the immediacy of the response, depending on one's training say--seizes the respondant with such force and swiftness that THERE IS NO ROOM NOR TIME FOR THOUGHT-
a push button respondant immediately to rush in on the attack--or to cry or handwring or shrug who knows--in terms of soldier turned artist's imagery--one wonders what built in responses there to it in different parts of the world-
an example of a  silence which meets an act of silencing, and that silence regarding the act installing as it were a regime of such silence--
in the us there was hardly any reporting at all, thus creating a ssilence a priori--regarding the Israeli Army and Police trying to shut ddown Palfest 2009--the Festival of Lieterature--on its opening and closing nights in Jersualem.  (In the interveing days the festival of poets toured the wet bank giving many readings--and observing everything possible)--
since there was no news of the event, there will be no protest of it, which in turn creates in which silencing and being silent unite int a form of complicitiy--
think of the contrast of these two statements:
"If it's not in writing it never happened."
and Walt Whitman's
"The Real War will Never be in the Books"
looked at from one angle it seems to suggest that what is in writing is not "real,"nor true--and that what is outside of this is where the reality lies, literally dead in the earth--
an uwritten writing, an unbookedone--a conceptual writing like Robert Smithson's "a great artist could cast a glance and it would be a work of art."
that is, there are no objects which imprsion what Smithson calls "the time of the interest"
if it is not in writing--it never happened--
yet the Real War will never be in the Books--
one might think on this in a great many ways--
(of courase someone in the back pipes up and says loudly, pronouncing with care the nostrum--"actions speak louder than words."
but do they thenwhen the persons actions are no more?lying in the fields and ditches--
a Real Death literally outside--
while what then is it one readsin writing that has ahppened that would not have if it were not for writing, for being written--
is everything wirtten permeated with the ambiguity of not being the Real War--and at the same time claiming to be what happened--
as hsitory--as ficiton--???
you see--a very amaazing condundrum to go with an amaing artilce--

OBITS

David Bromige=92s bold and experimental poetry won him multiple =20
literary honors and the respect of readers around the world. But the =20
retired Sonoma State University professor and former Sonoma County =20
Poet Laureate, who died June 3 at home in Sebastopol at the age of =20
75, will be remembered by those who knew and loved him for his rapier =20=

wit and generous support of other writers.

=93I am happy to say that in the last week of his life his family was =20=

reading to him my new memoir and he was laughing at my jokes. He =20
never missed a joke,=94 said former SSU colleague and novelist Jerry =20
Rosen.

Bromige, he praised, =93knew as much about contemporary poetry as any =20=

person in the world=94 and managed to communicate his love for poetry =20=

to his students during 25 years at SSU.

His wife of 28 years, Cecelia Belle, said he had a large filing =20
cabinet filled with what he labeled =93Uncalled For Manuscripts.=94 But =20=

he gave them all an insightful read and passed along encouragement =20
with his comments.

His prodigious gift for writing mixed with his giving spirit won him =20
many fans. Russian River poet Pat Nolan recalled watching him at a =20
gathering of poets five years ago, seated in the shade of a porch in =20
his signature Panama hat.

=93One by one, everyone at that gathering stepped up to pay their =20
respects to him...But the homage that was being paid to him that day =20
was more of that befitting a godfather.=94

Bromige had fought his way back from a heart attack and stroke in =20
2001, going on to serve as Poet Laureate of Sonoma County, writing, =20
mentoring other writers and giving readings. But a lifetime struggle =20
with the effects of diabetes finally caught up with him.

Only last month, he gave his last reading in a gathering by the =20
Healdsburg Literary Society of 16 poet laureates from around the =20
state. The ever dapper British-born writer stood to deliver his =20
piece, the first time he had risen from his wheelchair in many =20
months, said Belle.

The author of more than 40 books of prose and poetry, Bromige was =20
working on a memoir, =93Til There Was You,=94 at the time of his death. =20=

He also was eagerly collaborating with Reality Street press in =20
England to publish a complete collection of his poetry.

He could often be seen seated in a chair in the front yard of his =20
Sebastopol home soaking in the sun while pounding on a manual =20
typewriter.

Born in London, he was a childhood survivor of The Blitz of World War =20=

II. He attended agricultural college and worked on a farm in Sweden =20
before settling into a teaching program at the University of British =20
Columbia. But it was his poetry and playwriting that won him prizes =20
and a graduate scholarship to UC Berkeley.

He became involved in the emergence of historic poetic movements, and =20=

was taken up by the poets known as the San Francisco Renaissance, =20
=93who valued his erudition and his abilities with form and narrative,=94 =
=20
said fellow poet and provocative poetry blogger Ron Silliman.

Always questioning conventional wisdom in poetry and the arts, =20
Bromige was also adopted by young writers practicing what came to be =20
known as language poetry, said Silliman. His 1980 volume =93My Poetry=94 =
=20
is considered =93a classic of the genre,=94 he said.

Bromige counted among his distinguished mentors Robert Duncan of the =20
Black Mountain School of Poets and Denise Levertov, for whom he was a =20=

teaching assistant at Berkeley.

During his years at Sonoma State he helped launch and maintain the =20
university=92s literary magazines while bringing a host of =20
internationally known writers to campus.

His numerous honors include the Western States Book Award, the =20
Pushcart Prize for poetry, the Canada Council award and the Gertrude =20
Stein Award for Innovative Writing. In 1994 the Luther Burbank Center =20=

for the Arts named him a Sonoma County Living Treasure.

In addition to his wife he is survived by his son Christopher =20
Bromige, of Vancouver, B.C., his daughter Margaret Belle Bromise, of =20
Sebastopol, two grandchildren and numerous in-laws, nieces and nephews.

Bromige will be buried at Pleasant Hills Memorial Park in Sebastopol. =20=

A public celebration of his life is being planned for sometime in July.

The family suggests memorial contributions to the Sonoma County Book =20
Fair, socobookfest.org/donate.shtml.

no mention of Brooklyn New York native, Gilbert Sorrentino. "Imaginative Qualities of Actual Things" is a wonderful take on the New York artistic and literary world.

SITE-BASED PRACTICES
a workshop led by David Buuck & Jessica Tully
Marin Headlands Bunkers
Sunday June 21, 11am-2pm
co-sponsored by the Headlands Center for the Arts
Please join writer David Buuck and artist Jessica Tully for a site-specific workshop at the former military bunkers in the Marin Headlands. We will explore a wide range of methods and practices related to site-based writing and art practices, including several on-site exercises and experiments. This workshop is designed for ALL levels of interested writers and artists, to explore how we engage place, site, environment and the political histories therein as writers, artists, and citizens.  We will discuss and explore writing and research techniques as well as much more performative and embodied strategies of site-work, so be prepared to try new ways of thinking, moving, and working!

David Buuck is an alumni artist in residence this June at Headlands Center for the Arts. He is contributing editor at Artweek, and teaches at the San Francisco Art Institute. Recent publications include The Shunt (Palm Press)and Buried Treasure Island, a guidebook printed in conjunction with an installation and audio-tour by Barge (the Bay Area Research Group in Enviro-aesthetics).

Jessica Tully is a conceptual artist working at the intersection of culture and politics.  From hip-hop water ballet to a rock opera of live construction equipment to voter education drives, her site-specific performances, videos, drawings and campaigns are set within socially charged public spaces.  In 2008 she debuted a new stencil series and walking tour entitled Syndicate commissioned by Yerba Buena Center for the Arts for the Bay Area Now 5 triennial exhibition.

Note: We will meet at the Headlands Center Dining Hall at 11 for introductory remarks and head out from there. We will arrange for car-pooling to the site for those who need it. There will be optional pre-workshop readings. Bring notebook, camera, sunscreen and/or hat, outdoor shoes, layers for cold, etc. The Marin Headlands is home to several former military installations, including the bunkers, the Nike Missile Site, and the current home of the Headlands Center for the Arts. http://www.flickr.com/photos/24889946@N08/sets/72157618977407766/

Class is limited to 20 participants.

Dear Friends and Colleagues:

I learned today of the death of William Witherup.

Bill wrote some of the finest nature poems of the 20th century.

Twenty years ago, I reviewed "Black Ash, Orange Fire: Collected Poems =
1959-1985."=20
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Writing/witherup.htm=20

Then, in 2000, "Down Wind, Down River: New and Selected Poems" was =
published, which I also had the privilege of reviewing:
http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/weishaus/Writing/wither-2.htm

Bill will be missed, and the body of his work will live on.

-Joel=20

Subject:      ottawa: the unknown city by rob mclennan, arsenal pulp press

In 2008, Vancouver publisher Arsenal Pulp Press published my
travel/listings book Ottawa: The Unknown City as part of their ongoing
"unknown city" series, originally written to counter the false notion that
Ottawa is boring, and to counter Ottawa's baffling self-dismissal.
Unfortunately, the result was that the city media and booksellers, almost
completely ignored the title, thus rendering it impotent; thus putting it
exactly into the same problem it was working to counter.

This is a book I'm extremely proud of, and one that explores many aspects
of the city's literature, history, politics, alternative cultures,
festivals, music, sports and people, as well as listings of where to
purchase food, clothing, books and whatever else you might need while
inside a city, whether you have no money, some money or too damned much.

This is a book worth looking for, and looking at, and a tourist guide for
locals as much as for out-of-towners. Even if media and Chapters insist on
ignoring it, please be sure to check out a copy yourself, and make up your
own mind.

My Hubris in Writing Itselves


A description of a talk for the Subtle Technologies gathering (Toronto),
unpacking the following short abstract:

'The world, the body, the existent, have information in common; informa-
tion is always already inscribed. The real and the virtual commingle; they
appear separated only by virtue of a phenomenology of technology that
emphasizes prosthetics and cyberspace as "additional" fields of research
and perception. My work in the virtual world of Second Life describes
space, sexuality, and body as problematic inscriptions which require
negotiation within and without the Second Life environment. Inscriptions
have no beginning and no end; they're holographic in a holographic
universe. I'll explain, we'll look about.'


Information is a way of looking at the world; in-formation characterizes
the world. The body looks at the world which is of and not of the body;
the world is therefore abject, debris - almost, but not quite escaping.
What escapes is articulated by mathesis; mathesis is our window on the
existent. Mathesis grasps everything and nothing; an equation cannot
_directly_ move an object, but describes its structure to the extent that
its structure is nothing. Mathesis is what lies beyond the reach of the
_gesture._

The _existent_ is almost entirely unobservable, process at a distance;
beyond the imminent, the existent and mathesis coalesce. Neither copula
nor protocol statement apply, and the verb 'to be' devolves, itself
abject, inconceivable. (In fact, what is abject is inconceivable; what is
conceivable is potentially parameterized.)

Information is always already inscribed: The world as imminent totality
(which for us is a broken totality, broken immanence) possesses an onto-
logy of inscriptions and an collocation of nearly decomposable epistemolo-
gies. The ontology of inscriptions devolves as well to collocations of the
ordinary.

The real and the virtual commingle, since there is no split, only a
dividing-up of ontologies of the ordinary. Inscription is always virtual,
always real; inscription is _neti neti,_ Sheffer-stroke and its dual
fundamental. Don't mistake this for an ontology based on propositional
logic - that, too, falls by the wayside.

'The real and the virtual commingle; they appear separated only by virtue
of a phenomenology of technology that emphasizes prosthetics and cyber-
space as "additional" fields of research and perception.' Let us think
this through together. Technology implies progress, procedures, split,
free and bound variables, mathesis, 'materiality'; phenomenology implies a
deep and potentially fundamental structuration of 'world' in the broadest
sense possible. We can define _broken phenomenology_ as a combination of
phenomenology and heuristics of the imminent. Broken phenomenology _cannot
be extrapolated._ Prosthetics is what engenders from exteriority; what
might be diacritical, addendum; what bridges world-body and body-world;
what in-forms body, forming-body. Prosthetics is sited, gestural - as
usual in this thought, prosthetics is imminent.

All space is cyberspace, helmed, to the extent that space is _thought,_
related to the thinking-of space. All space is steerage in this sense. But
what is at stake in the quote above is that of '"additional" fields of
research and perception.' Research is not necessarily perception and
perception is not necessarily research. Fields in the sense used here are
ideological-cultural constructs, discursive formations, loosely defined
domains. Now I am questioning through this '"additional"' separations that
are explicate, not implicate (in the sense of Bohm's implicate order),
and whose entanglements can ultimately, theoretically, be separated. Let
us replace 'additional' with 'mess,' with 'more of the same,' with 'rasa'
or 'tenor' and let us think through fields or fielding as wide and wild
indefinite domains (wildernesses) of inscriptions, fields, particulations,
intensifications, strange and other attractors. Let us think of the world
as inherently _lossy,_ and by world I refer to potential 10^500 universes.

Here is the rest of the quote, which is fluff, descriptive of one project/
ing among many by many, and which doesn't necessarily map into the above:
'My work in the virtual world of Second Life describes space, sexuality,
and body as problematic inscriptions which require negotiation within and
without the Second Life environment. Inscriptions have no beginning and no
end; they're holographic in a holographic universe. I'll explain, we'll
look about.' And what 'about' this? Second Life is a 'virtual world' in a
technical sense that is a world which has a broken imminent ontology in
relation to the avatar operator organism; it's a projection based on
fundamental protocols and matheses. Within the server++ domain, SL is a
totalization, total institution, and in this sense a _seriality_ (Sartre)
as well. In a very classical sense, it is always already inscribed,
channels of information constructed from binary encoding within deep
potential wells. So my 'work' in SL is addenda, supplement - my 'work' in
SL is the appearance of installations-within-the-virtual of SL, bending
the local fabric of SL into patternings which are fundamentally the usual.
Nothing new here at all. The installation then 'deals with' - is 'about' -
inheres within the sememe - of body, space, sexuality, and deals with
these in the in-forming of abject fields of indexicalities, negotiations
of process and movement, crude effects of avatar presence or absence, and
so forth. There's nothing more than the narratology implied, which, if it
is a form of research at all, is a form depending on the psycho-analytics
of inscription and inscriptive processes anywhere at all. But there's
more: I argue that inscriptions and inscriptive processes are 'problem-
atic,' problematized, by which I mean, there are no problems and no
solutions, only the inhering _mess_ of entanglement and imminent domains.
Now the negotiations of the subject organism (not object/avatar) are
within and without the SL environment, by which I mean they are flux-
states that are basically irresolute as well, and that tend to corrode law
and justice (as well as subject and object) _everywhere,_ just as
intellectual property is corroded among reals and virtuals, duplications
and instantiations, variora and holograph editions, everywhen and
everywhere. Think of such property as extended inscriptions and remember
the old adage that there are no authors (bad paraphrase); one might see
everything inhering, and in that sense might read Dufrenne's phenomenology
of literary worlds as not only indefinite and imminent, but gesturing
towards an inauthentic immanence, and in this gesturing, corroding
everything: Literature, then, is a corrosion, not construction, of worlds
(in the sense of worlds as habitus, inhabitations).

Again, 'Inscriptions have no beginning and no end; they're holographic in
a holographic universe. I'll explain, we'll look about.' 'Holographic'
references Susskind's theory, of which I have nothing to say (not being-
physicist, string or otherwise), but it also references a modeling of
entangling in such a manner as perception (read 'theory' as well) is
blurred, domainless, holography modeling itselves within itselves. Sooner
or later these 'quick' broken epistemologies and ontologies will replace
the older classical models; sooner or later the universe (world, cosmos)
will be recognized as fast-forward fast-backward slow-forward slow-back-
ward among inconceivable (broken) orders of magnitude; psychoanalysis
pales as domains fall into alien abjections which are deeply unknowable.
The hall of mirrors requires quick-depth disorderings.

I say 'I'll explain' but there is no explanation, not on this level any-
way, nothing of the physics or mathesis of it, embedded almost as if in
defiance of the 'real.' Or the explanation is without concept of origins,
neither punctum nor 'turtles all the way down' nor mutual creating and
recursion. Or the anecdotal is all that's left.

I say 'we'll look about' this is nothing but a reference to the particu-
lar installation, 'about' the usual confine. And of course in looking, am
I not your prosthesis, to the extent that I am not?

I use Patchen every year in my Chicago Public School classes. I have What
Shall We Do Without Us? which reproduces many fine picture poems in color.
The kids go nuts!

This looks / sounds like a fantastic project:



On the afternoon of Sunday June 7, a group of visionary artists will lead
sonic excursions throughout New York as part of a rare live sonic arts
experiment - the ISSUE Project Room Soundwalk-a-thon - a fundraiser and
collective public inquiry into the connection between urban space and our
collective sonic imaginations.

Led and designed by some of New York's most exciting sound artists and
musicians, these walks will take groups of 10-20 people at a time on an
intimate journey of sonic discovery to experience our community in a way
they may never have done before - through sound. Walks range from meditative
deep listening, to sing-a-longs, to noise-making walks incorporating
instruments, iPods, boomboxes, cell phones, or silence in order to amplify
the nuances of our ever-changing soundscape.

David was brilliantly witty, and warm as well. I loved our 4-way banter
on the list years ago (w/ Rachel Loden and George Bowering). Cracked me
up every time. And so lovely in person, when I met him at Orono. What a
shining light.

http://www.subtletechnologies.com/2009/?page_id=206

The Pauline Oliveros / Ione / Chris Chafe trio
Pioneers in extended forms of American New Music; their performance
explores musical spaces often across physical spaces. Blending music
and spoken word improvisation, the festival performance links stages
in Toronto and Banff. The three have been developing artistic
practice within the telematic medium collectively.

Pauline Oliveros, composer, performer and humanitarian is an
important pioneer in American Music. Acclaimed internationally, for
four decades she has explored sound -- forging new ground for herself
and others.Deep Listening, her lifetime practice, is fundamental to
her composing, performing and teaching. She serves as Distinguished
Research Professor of Music at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy
NY; Darius Milhaud Artist-in-residence at Mills College, Oakland CA;
and president of the Deep Listening Institute in Kingston NY.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Oliveros
Chris Chafe is a composer, cellist, music researcher with an interest
in computer music composition and interactive performance. He has
been a long-term denizen of the Center for Computer Research in Music
and Acoustics, Stanford University, where he directs the centre and
teaches computer music courses. Chafe developed the Jack Trip
software which has enabled an exploration in near realtime telematic
music. Using a fast network the open source software facilitates an
eight channel Cd quality audio link where bi-costal delays are around
400 milliseconds.
IONE is an author, playwright and director, & spoken word performer,
whose seminal work, Pride of Family; Four Generations of American
Women of Color, (a New York Times Notable Book) was published in a
classic edition by Doubleday/Broadway Books. (October 2004). Ione is
also the Artistic Director of Deep Listening Institute, Ltd.

Alan Sondheim
Alan Sondheim and Sandy Baldwin performing in Second Life: Sandy and
I AvaTanz together which means we trigger objects to take us over,
splurge on the chat, maybe have some sound at work beyond the usual
click-clack, and work those altered mocap files at around 800 meters
transparent space. Usually stuff crashes; here, who knows? It's about
eroticism, memory of neighborhood, being-mess.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sondheim

Second Front - performance of Red White and Blue Dawn
Second Front are a pioneering avatar performance group in Second
Life. They create theatres of the absurd that challenge notions of
virtual embodiment, online performance and the
formation of virtual narrative. Tactical art by the performance group
currently serving a Second Life sentence. Scott Kildall and Patrick
Lichty will be present in the flesh.
http://www.secondfront.org/blog/

Jeremy Bailey - ~QWar Mail~R
a launch of War Mail by Demo-Performer Jeremy Bailey.
Bailey creates videos and performances that demonstrate satirical
software programs of his own design. His work has been described by
filmmaker magazine as ~Sa one man revolution on the way we use video,
computers and our bodies to create art~T.
http://www.jeremybailey.net/

Johannes Birringer - Ukiyo - Movable World
Johannes Birringer will present an excerpt from the choreographic
installation UKYIO, a collaboration between performers in the UK and
Tokyo. The performance blends audio, dance, and digital projections,
inviting the audience to shift its perspectives by moving among the
various elements as the work unfolds.

Dear Poetics List,

I recently rejoined the list and it is nice to be back. I am glad it
is still going strong, for I have a humble request for assistance.

I=92m trying to assess poetry by American poets that have written on the
American invasion and occupation of Iraq. It=92s for research purposes=97I
am especially interested in antiwar poetry, but if there is also
pro-war poetry it would be important to know of it. As I am living in
Taiwan and have scant access to small journals (of which there are
hundreds) any suggestions for notable poems and essays would be
greatly appreciated.

An anticipatory thank you for any help.

Matt Cutts, head of Google's web spam team, has a terrific blog post about a
$65 barcode scanner you can buy from Amazon.com. You can scan the barcodes
and easily upload them to Google's My Library. Among other things, you can
combine this with Google booksearch and do a full textual search of your
entire library. A lot of potential there...

Hi all,

I'm working with a student this summer who's writing horror fiction, a genre I haven't done much reading in myself.  I was wondering if there are any recommendations for essays about the genre, or recent writers I should plunge into besides Stephen King or Clive Barker.

Many thanks,

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

King's son, Joe Hill's novel, Heart-Shaped Box is quite good. I'm not up on

Before WRITING

WRITING

& AFTER WRITING

A poetics course w/

David Meltzer &

Neeli cherkovski

July 21st through august 25th

6 consecutive Tuesday nights

7:00 - 9:30 pm

Presented by the

Bird & beckett

Cultural legacy project

653 chenery st., SF, ca 94131

www.birdbeckett.com

415.586.3733

$100 for All 6 sessions

in advance, or

$20 per session, on a

space available basis



 We will talk about origins -- When

did poetry begin? Why do we

choose the poem as a primary

means of expression? What does it

mean to take on the identity of

"Poet?" These and other crucial

questions become the ground for

talking about the life of a poet over

time, and the relationship of poetry

to art and music. Haiku, Whitman

and Dickinson, modernists such as

W.C. Williams and H.D. -- along with

the poetry of today, will lead us to

look on the role of a poet in the

larger society.

The English novelist Colin Wilson has a couple of Lovecraft
imitation/homages.

Hugh:

Though he's not named as such, I'd argue Chuck Palhniuk is a contemporary
master of horror (or he's a provocative tangent of that genre). That's
certainly how much of his work (Haunted, Invisible Monsters, Dairy) was read
by my high school students in the last decade. Many adventerous readers also
liked looking back at H. P. Lovecraft.

Best, Crag

Dear George,

So very sorry to hear about David Bromige.
I enjoyed your banter - yours & Rachel's & Maria's on this list.

Living here not going there I never met him but I think I'd have
enjoyed that privilege .

But I'm emailing to give you Jacket on this other current subject,
Gilbert Sorrentino

All good wishes & condolences to friends of David B.

(CHICAGO, IL)
We want to launch your book. On a catapult. We're not kidding.

If you have recently finished writing a book, or have published your first =
book in the past year (or just feel like taking out some aggression on a pu=
blication of your choice), we invite you to celebrate by launching your wor=
k into space--or at least halfway down the block.

In addition to the catapult book launch, we're hosting a literary science f=
air so that you can receive proper admiration for your writing. Now is your=
 chance to explain to the world what's so special about your fiction, poetr=
y, non-fiction...by means of a diorama, poster, or tri-fold board. Baking s=
oda volcanoes are welcome, colorful graphs encouraged.

Because space is limited, if you'd like to participate in the literary scie=
nce fair, we'll need a short proposal for any table-top display, due by 15 =
June. (We'll squeeze in as many as we can, but space will be available on a=
 first-come, first-served basis.)=20

OUT OF TOWN WRITERS are encouraged to submit posters, rather than moping at=
 home all night on Facebook.  Note that we have near-unlimited room for wal=
l poster displays.=20

I'd recommend two of Richard Matheson's books, The Shrinking Man (aka The I=
ncredible Shrinking Man) and, especially, I Am Legend. =A0The latter's been=
 the basis for three bad films, most recently Will Smith's. =A0The books ar=
e both very good.
Anne Rice's first vampire book, Interview with the Vampire, is also a very =
good novel; the second, The Vampire Lestat, is passable, much less rich. =
=A0I wouldn't recommend the third and that's the place where I stopped read=
ing the series.
I read Stephen King's novel in the 70s and 80s and recall that his best boo=
k, at least from that time, is Cujo.
I've been meaning to follow up on Peter Fleming's work after coming across =
his lycanthrope story, "The Kill," in an anthology some years ago.
Good luck with the student.

The classiest horror story I've read recently is by (brilliant)
British young adult author David Almond: a novel called Clay.
Genuinely chilling devil's child story.

Hi Catharine,

According to my research, 'The History of Luminous Motion'(Knopf) & 'Good
Girl Wants it Bad', are written by Scott Bradfield and not Patrick Mc Grath
Scott as per your message.  Hope this helps.

Regards,

Roy Exley.

Dean:

I highly recommend Brian Turner's _Here, Bullet_.  Turner served in the inf=
antry during the war.  We had Turner give a reading here a few years ago, a=
nd he was great.

There is also, of course, the Sam Hamill collection, _Poets Against the War=
_, which contains a fairly wide range of responses.  In addition various co=
llections were produced as resistance geared up in 2003.  The online journa=
l nthposition (www.nthposition.com<http://www.nthposition.com/>) produced 3=
 different PDF-only e-books anthologizing antiwar poetry: _100 Poets Agains=
t the War_, _100 Poets Against the War Redux_, and _100 Poets Against the W=
ar 3.0_.  If you can't find these online, b/c me and I can send them to you=
.

You might also want to browse the archives of Poetics-L: I remember a flurr=
y of writings coming out of the list as the war erupted--lots of exchanges =
about what poets could do, and many poets communicating with each other abo=
ut their newly published or performed antiwar works.  In addition, several =
antiwar poetry websites were constructed in response to the war.  Most seem=
 to be dead now, but some still exist.  I have the links in my office PC, s=
o if you'd like these, just b/c me.

Xerolage 43=97Grapyrus by Matina L. Stamatakis


Matina Stamatakis has "arrived" even if the rest of the world has been
too slow to realize it. Her newest "art/non" textscape is a veritable
plum pudding of ruthless extravagance, a cryptological scherzo written
in "sanscript", so to speak. Teasing out texture from text, this most
recent offering from the Xerolage series has a haunting aspect that
unites papyri and the phantom after-effects of words in constant
stochastic exile. In essence, Stamatakis "writes" perpetually double,
the reflection upon a surface of "lin/geist" that judders with an
ekphrastic motion of the cinematic or photographic double-take.

=97Kane X. Faucher

Tombstones and footprints, prehistoric imperial Chinese silk
distressed and preserved in airtight tombs, Sapphic papyrus scrolls
used as winding sheets for the human dead: languaged shapes (letters,
glyphs, cuneiform, runes) layer each other on multidimensional,
neonic, poly-textural surfaces that glow through the eras, aeons and
ages.  Evocative of sound, syntax and melismatic intuition, these
works are endlessly resonant through time, space, and mind, expanding
them all.

=97Maria Damon

In Matina Stamatakis' Grapyrus, an utterly fresh light unveils
antiquities. Under the cold glare of the photocopier's bulb new
thoughts are seared onto the richly textured venerability of the page.
Here is a vibrantly dark art that does not merely mimic or ape
antediluvian roots, but consciously honors and revises them,
relentlessly refreshing deep-seeded threads of thought. Flourishing
gestures of contemporary graffiti no longer deface or elide, but
honor; the visually brutalizing process of Xeroxing accentuates,

pasted to crumbling edifices, and couldn't be happier to be so utterly
lost.

A Catalogue of Rare Movements by Monica McFawn & Curtis A. Rhodes

from the introduction:

Making art is hard. The empty page or canvas seems limitless and
glorious, one of the few places where anything can happen. But the
moment a word is written or a mark made, what can happen is
suddenly=97violently=97limited. A line is a barrier, and words silence all
other words that could have been said. To commit to a course of action
in art is, paradoxically, to commit to not-doing the infinite anything
else. Making art is the bold relinquishing of possibility.

In the larger world of art, every art movement is a theory of how to
get free=97how to get free of the influence of earlier artists, how to
get free of public expectation, and how to get free of the limitations
of what one has already done. In the insular world of this Catalogue,
each of our art movements likewise describes how a drawing tried to
transcend itself. The following work is an example of what can happen
within, or as a result of, narrow constraints. Each drawing was
created using a strict set of rules: they were collaboratively drawn
with the same pens, using a postcard-sized rectangle as a starting
point. The box is the first limitation, the other person=92s
contribution another.

Within this insular process, the subtitles, deviations, and variations
took on particular import. A Catalogue of Rare Movements depicts
twenty-four art movements that flourished and flared out in this tight
space of possibility. Xerolage 42- Monica McFawn & Curtis A.
RhodesEach drawing itself became a theory of art, rising up and
burning out within the course of its creation. But by the time each
art movement was identified, it was already obsolete, and only another
drawing could get us free of it.

There's plenty of anti-war poetry here, from the continued military
harassment of Iraq under Clinton through the present.

Here's one example:

Subject:      "The end is the beginning." Harold Norse, dies at 92.

*************************************************************************

We recently received word that Harold Norse passed away on Monday.=C2=A0 He=
 was 92.=C2=A0=20

The Beat Museum will be hosting a Memorial forHarold on Sunday, July 12th, =
time TBA


From the Beat Museum: "In 1951, Norse's talent was recognized by William Ca=
rlos Williams, who invited him to read at the Museum of Modern Art
in early 1952. Williams remarked on Norse's ability to "use the direct
image on its own," and became an important mentor to Harold. Williams
would later call Norse "the best poet of his generation," a profound
accolade considering Williams was mentor to such figures as Charles Olson, =
Denise Levertov, and Allen Ginsberg. Following the 1953 publication of his =
first book of poetry, The Undersea Mountain, which was reviewed in The New =
York Times and Poetry magazine, Norse left America for Italy.

In 1957, Norse was nearly deported from Italy when the Italian government d=
eemed his poem "Victor Emmanuel Monument (Rome)," political fodder for the =
Communists.

Norse moved to Paris in 1960, on a tip from Williams, and at the Beat Hotel=
 he met Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin,
and others, drawn by their interest in Buddhist meditation, which Norse
had recently taken up. Using the cut-up technique devised by Gysin and
Burroughs, Norse wrote his experimental novel, Beat Hotel. Originally
titled Sniffing Keyholes, the first chapter=E2=80=94which he describes as "=
a
sex/dope scene between a muscular black youth called Melo and a blond
Russian princess called Z.Z."=E2=80=94 made even the often stoic Burroughs
laugh. During his time at the Beat Hotel, Norse began creating his
'random paintings' or Cosmographs (using the hotel's bidet).

Norse
returned to America in 1969, and with Carnivorous Saint: Gay Poems
1941-1976 became a leading gay liberation poet. For the last 35 years
he has lived in San Francisco=E2=80=99s Mission District."

Talking points (OCAD talk)


1. The virtual and real are united by inscription: inscription is a form
of mark.

2. The body is always already inscribed.

3. A 'metric' is associated with every phenomenology - a certain _tenor_
of behavior, style of inscription.

4. The 'metric' sets forth 'geodesics,' paths of least resistance; it's
easiest to construct along them - in which case what might be considered
'corporate style' dominates.

5. There is always the possibility of the cheat, kludge, or hack:
a. Cheat: something appearing as more or less than it is, something
'magical.'
b. Kludge: making do, using available tech: the clumsy.
c. Hack: beneath the surface, something doing something it wasn't 'intended' to
do. Along this line: reality was intended to _do nothing_
of course.

6. Inscription is information; the more information, the less entropy.
Information is of various sorts:
a. Autonomous: Information within event horizons (black holes, universes).
b. Intended: Information created by _agency_ - in which case one might
speak of residue and parasitism.
c. Unintended: residue or trace.

7. In my work I want to make a mess, something apparently disordered,
something _abject._
a. Abject because impossible to disentangle.
b. The world is deeply entangled.
c. Outside of narrative, the world is _inherently_ entangled.
d. Through reduction, narrative tries to make sense of the world.
e. Through expansion, non-narratives inhabit it, i.e. are _equivalent_
'one way or another.'

8. Intended or interpreted information:
Information is a way of looking at the world; in-formation characterizes the
world. The body looks at the world which is of and not of the body; the world
is therefore abject, debris - almost, but not quite escaping. What escapes is
articulated by mathesis; mathesis is our window on the existent. Mathesis
grasps everything and nothing; an equation cannot _directly_ move an object,
but describes its structure to the extent that its structure is nothing.
Mathesis is what lies beyond the reach of the _gesture._

9. The ontology of mathesis is neither real nor virtual: Mathematics, in
other words, is elsewhere.

10 The more the universe is 'comprehended' in terms of fundamental
characteristics, the greater the mathesis required.

11. Eventually mathesis dominates and the use of 'proper models' falls by
the wayside.

12. The question: 'How are we' within the alien - i.e. within a knowledge
that we occur, inhabit, the alien?

Hi all,
=C2=A0
My=C2=A0book Manhatten=C2=A0is just out=C2=A0and I=E2=80=99m celebrating wi=
th a launch:=C2=A0
=C2=A0
Friday June 26, 7:30pm, Canessa Park Gallery, 708 Montgomery (x Washington)=
 in San Francisco.

Reading with me from Manhatten will be poets Dana Teen Lomax, Erin Wilson, =
Jono Schneider, Andrew Felsinger, and Lauren Schiffman. Bay Area musician S=
teve Musial will perform on classical guitar. Wine, tea, other non-alc bevs=
, and desserts will be served.

Parking in the immediate vicinity is usually findable; here's a garage just=
 in case: http://www.sfpsg.com/directions.php

 visit http://spdbooks.org=C2=A0(also available at Amazon).

From the jacket:

This is not the mythic Manhattan of bright lights and glitz. It is called M=
anhatten and it is wonderfully out of kilter. In this mixed-genre book (fic=
tion, poetry, review), Sarah Rosenthal layers headlong, voice-driven prose =
with silent, otherly poems to tell a story of an island where relationships=
 are disturbed yet meaningful and luminous. --Juliana Spahr

Proudly misspelled, Manhatten chronicles the adventures of a young woman as=
 she searches for her life story in the ultimate American metropolis. The h=
eroine--who may or may not be author Sarah Rosenthal--leads the reader into=
 one scene after another filled with family, friends, chance acquaintances,=
 exes, and current love interests, where relationships and geography intert=
wine and memories collect on every street corner. As keen and insistent as =
the city it describes, this writing attains a clarity fueled by hunger for =
insight and language's tonal responsiveness. Spanning two coasts, leaping w=
hole decades in a single clause, Manhatten documents the rush of events and=
 the meditative spaces between, negotiating a life complete with all its en=
chantments, illusions, intersections, and collisions. --Pamela Lu

I like Sarah Rosenthal's Manhatten because it's generous with self. Also al=
armingly well written. And best of all, Manhatten awkwardly and beautifully=
 makes the claim that heterosexuals are human too! --Eileen Myles

Thanks,
Sarah

Nobody's mentioned Frankenstein or Dracula. The latter tends to get
short shrift as literature, but it's very fine, very perverse.

I just published a novel with Blazevox, And Beefheart Saved Craig. It is full of typographical experimentation. I am going on a reading tour from Minneapolis to Rhode Island during the last week of July and the second week of Aug. If anyone could help me set up a reading in either a public or private space, I would appreciate it.

If I read in a private place, I will sell books for wholesale: $4.

Hi all,

Many thanks for all the suggestions!  If I could narrow things down a little more, I'm particularly looking for Horror writing from African American/Canadian writers.  There's some Octavia Butler and Nalo Hopkinson I plan to show my student, but other leads would be most welcome.

Thanks,

Hugh Behm-Steinberg

The classiest horror story I've read recently is by (brilliant)
British young adult author David Almond: a novel called Clay.
Genuinely chilling devil's child story.

"Joel Chace=92s reading at Robins Books May 19 makes me want to look at his
linebreaks again," wrote Ron Silliman in a footnote to a recent post to his
blog. This new chapbook provides the perfect opportunity.


A SCRIPT
Joel Chace
24 pages

$8.25 + p&h

Joel Chace's A Script cons our part: part Asbergian stutter, part zen
enlightenment, words and white spaces carefully/randomly placed pace us
through a spectrum of verbal light, asking if there is a difference between
self and other, background and text. These experiments of space and the
phrase and word range over nature, food, and communication, invoking Inca
and Silliman both, "speaking that other language again ... yield itself eac=
h
sentence." =97Larissa Shmailo

I like what Joel Chace does with the topology of the line, the way he shows
how far it can be stretched while still maintaining its integrity. And I
like how in doing so he takes the plainest words=97especially everyday noun=
s
like work, linen, world, office, desk, ceiling=97and makes them oddly visib=
le
in the poem's raking light:
"words        /                tiny         far
         but clear" indeed.  =97Barry Schwabsky

The IL Adult Education program provides ESL and GED classes to immigrants, refugees, and people without high school degrees at the City Colleges of Chicago and across the state.  With the current state budget crisis, $53.7 million dollars in state and federal Adult Education and Family Literacy funding will be lost if the Illinois Community College Board's funding is eliminated.

Tell the IL government that you support the Adult Education Program and oppose any cuts to its funding.  People need education to get jobs.

You can reply to anna.vitale@gmail.com.

For those who might be interested, my current posting on Poems & Poetics =
(poemsandpoetics.blogspot.com) is the first installment of Outsider =
Poems, a mini-anthology in progress.  What I'm hoping to do here is to =
work in public while assembling material toward a gathering of poems & =
near-poems from anywhere/anytime that exist in literate societies but =
outside of the normative literary nexus.  I'll be developing the project =
- as far as I can take it - with a sense that the term "outsider poetry" =
can cover a wide range of sources & possibilities, from art brut & =
mystical/religious poems & offerings to folk & working class poetry, =
sermons & rants, glossolalia & glossographia, dialect & "nation =
language" (K. Brathwaite), & so on - works in short both written & oral. =
 In doing so, as with Poems for the Millennium, I'll be open to =
suggestions from anyone out there, both definitional or theoretical ones =
for "outsider poetry" in general and specific ones for the selection of =
poems & poets.  I don't for the moment know exactly where this is taking =
me, but that's the pleasure & mystery of any new beginning.

Beckett as Poet; unpublished Beckett, Frost, Paz; great current poetry

FULCRUM: An Annual of Poetry and Aesthetics, #6 (730 pages) features unco=
llected Samuel Beckett; unpublished Robert Frost and Octavio Paz; essays =
by Christopher Ricks, Marjorie Perloff, Eliot Weinberger and many others;=
 a feature on "Poetry and Myth"; a debate between poets John Kinsella and=
 Rosanna Warren; translations of Seferis, Vian, Quevedo; and a great deal=
 more.

Most readers of Samuel Beckett are well acquainted with his plays and pro=
se, but few are aware that Becket was a considerable, stunningly original=
 poet. The special feature (185 pages) on "Samuel Beckett as Poet," edite=
d by Philip Nikolayev in the current FULCRUM #6, presents Beckett's negle=
cted masterpiece, "Ceiling," drawings of Beckett from life by Avigdor Ari=
kha, and essays by Christopher Ricks, Marjorie Perloff, Eliot Weinberger,=
 Anne Atik, S. E. Gontarski, Jean-Michel Rabat=C3=A9, Simon Critchley, Ch=
ris Ackerley, Se=C3=A1n Lawlor, David Wheatley, Mark Nixon, Philip Nikola=
yev, Daniel Albright, and a previously unpublished conversation between O=
ctavio Paz and Eliot Weinberger on Beckett's English translation of An An=
thology of Mexican Poetry. A few of the essays quote extensively from Bec=
kett's unpublished correspondence and manuscripts.

FULCRUM # 6 also presents previously unpublished lectures by Robert Frost=
 ("The Claims of Poetry," "The Most Dangerous Phrase in America," and "Th=
e Natural and Supernatural Bounds of Science"), transcribed with annotati=
on and commentary by Frost scholar James Sitar.

The special "Poetry and Myth" section, edited by Cliff Forshaw and David =
Kennedy, presents a variety of essays and poems on the subject.

And there is a great deal more outstanding poetry and criticism in the is=
sue!

"FULCRUM has in only a few years established itself as a must-read journa=
l, a unique annual of literary and intellectual substance positioned on t=
he cutting edge of culture."--Billy Collins

"FULCRUM serves as a primary resource for anyone interested in diverse po=
etic practices not only from these States, but also from around our tremb=
ling globe."--Michael Palmer

FULCRUM #6 is 730 pages long and offered at an artificially low price. Pl=
ease visit http://fulcrumpoetry.com for more information, or to acquire a=

*For Immediate Release * 13 June 2009 *

Just as you make the chronic mistake of believing the intrepid Keith Tuma t=
o
have pulled his final card in a teetering gambit of interlocking blitz
evacuations, Critical Documents finds itself with recourse to naught but
impassioned hyperbolic announcement of Tuma's very own THE PARIS HILTON, no=
w
available at websites such as http://plantarchy.us/the-paris-hilton.html.
This slick red pamphlet, filled to the over-running nostril's brim with som=
e
32 mono-lyric squibs, torqued in the veritable plain style, and made to
rhyme itself, is priced at $5/=A33.50, that's with postage included, and wi=
ll
ship instantly to locations around the entire globe. Remote interpretations
imply such predictions as: first edition of thousands / eminent upon sell
out. Even Mao, his celebrated verses, couldn't so efficiently dish. The
printers themselves have ordered 30 bags of Tuma *straight*, and Hilton
herself has put out an indeterminate A.P.B. for some lines of "that *pure*
Tumaein stuff". The cover image is by Tom Raworth. Paypal purchases may be
made online or through the mail, payable to Critical Documents at 40
Brighton Street - Providence, RI 02909 - USA. Those of you attending the
upcoming SoundEye festival will find them available for purchase from the
Author himself. Potential reviewers encouraged to send inquiries.

'June 2008 through March 2009, I worked in an installation/performance
space called Odyssey in the virtual world Second Life. I changed the
environment almost daily, reflecting dynamic (moving, shuddering) complex
spaces that were narratives in their own right, difficult to navigate,
built on phenomenologies of being virtual real, really virtual. I will
walk/work my way through these transformations, presenting videos and
images of installations with Azure Carter), dance (with Foofwa d'Imobilite
and Sandy Baldwin), and performance (with Sandy Baldwin). This work is
unique within and without Second Life.' - A.S."

Best outsider poet I know is Malok.  Never read a poem in his life, in & out
of mental hospitals in the late 70s (once for trying to take over a naval
carrier), on the dole, hermit, curmudgeon, divinely inspired by Charles
Bronson...  You can real a lot of his work at

http://malok.org

Also new recordings soon out of his reading of F*ck Dirge & of C*nt Utters
produced by Foist.  Also a full length documentary of Malok by Camille Bacos
is in the works.

This past winter, I recorded some poems in downtown Toronto for a programme
designed for high school students in the British Columbia Interior. The
students viewed the videos and then they and I met online, where they asked
me questions and I got them to write poems.

The videos are here:

Jerome,
I don't have any ideas right now, but I think that is a wonderful idea.

For those who might be interested, my current posting on Poems & Poetics (p=
oemsandpoetics.blogspot.com) is the first installment of Outsider Poems, a =
mini-anthology in progress.=A0 What I'm hoping to do here is to work in pub=
lic while assembling material toward a gathering of poems & near-poems from=
 anywhere/anytime that exist in literate societies but outside of the norma=
tive literary nexus.=A0 I'll be developing the project - as far as I can ta=
ke it - with a sense that the term "outsider poetry" can cover a wide range=
 of sources & possibilities, from art brut & mystical/religious poems & off=
erings to folk & working class poetry, sermons & rants, glossolalia & gloss=
ographia, dialect & "nation language" (K. Brathwaite), & so on - works in s=
hort both written & oral.=A0 In doing so, as with Poems for the Millennium,=
 I'll be open to suggestions from anyone out there, both definitional or th=
eoretical ones for "outsider poetry" in general and specific ones for
 the selection of poems & poets.=A0 I don't for the moment know exactly whe=
re this is taking me, but that's the pleasure & mystery of any new beginnin=
g.

Ironically, the attacks--and making fun of in a nasty way--on the French
"influence" mirror a long standing American popular tradition of equating
the French with crazy ideas, moral turpitude, a fey (vaguely homosexual)
style of speaking and gesturing, and cowardice in war, insuring their alway=
s
needing the US to "save them".

My mom used to point this out to me a lot growing up, especially when at th=
e
movies.  In Casablanca, the morally ambiguous middleman between opposing
sides is Louis (Claude Rains), in the Deer Hunter the courrputer of
Christopher Walken is French; then of course there's The French Connection
and Maurice Chevalier sining "I like little girls."  (Spoofed by Gerard
Deparideu in a film in which his American-raised duaghter has told everyone
that her French father is actually her lover.Immediately the French father
is loathed as an overaged lover of possibly underage girls, who goes about
play8ing piano and singing about hoe he "likes little girls.)

I remeber that during the buildup of the final months leading to the US
Invasion of Iraq, FOX Netwrok had a daily anti-fench/make fun of the French
number of  inutes set aside everyday for viewers to join in, like the "Two
Minutes of Hate" in orwell's 1984.

Remember how French Fries had to be changed to Liberty Fries!!???? Despite
the fact that the Statue of Liberty herself is a gift from France--

I saw also a book called "Our First Enemey"--France!! because "we" as
colonials fought them in the French and Indian Wars.

Being from the family of the defeated French and Indians, my mother used to
remind me how this defeat of "cowards" who were more into fashion than
fighting,  has been wrapped in the arms of American culture ever since,
despite Lafayette and the pardon of Jean Lafitte (the famous pierate)  for
services rendered to the Americans  during the War of 1812.

So--what red blooded American writer of any gender would want to emulate
these scum or be caught reading one of their twisted perversion spanwing
works?

Don't you know how stupid the French are people cry--they worship Poe and
Jerry Lewis!

Depite the occaisonal "fashionable" intrusion of French thought into
American acedemia, for the most part American poetry is influeced as Jason
wrote--by the Anglo-philsiophers and by previous American writers in the
"Modernist" tradition.  (Charles Olson used the word "postmodern" in a 1950
statement.)

Actually from the too little I have read of more recent American poetry and
prose, novels--I would say the biggest influences have been Creative Writin=
g
taught in any of the now available manners.

Often one reads a sentence that has been so carefully worked, a phrase in
apoem, a line--that has been labored over as a Diamond erging from the
rough--and at the end of the phrase so gorgous so compolte so fixed,--
I always looka round expecting to hear clapping--

My guess is that comes from the endless classes, workshops, groups, etc
people seem to be willing to  undergo--
"wreading expperiments" to produce "experimental poets," solid poem
production taught in another place, and over here--"the Duncan Tradition,"
and there The Spicer radio playing at basebal game--seenon tiv in a bar.

Perhaps these exercises themselves are part of that mystical training in
Becoming a Poet in the "Imitation of Christ" enactments of depravity
debauchery or simple clean livin and the great karmic Outdoors--that are
"guaranteed to  PRODUCE THE POWERFUL POET WITHIN YOU--and Heed the Call of
the --wild or bar or philsophical discrpancies and so forth--

Has joining Poetry become something akin to joining the Army or a Club Scen=
e
inwehcih identity is part of "group formation?"

Who knows??
The main thing above al is don't have anything to do with the French!

If I may speak as an amateur for a moment, there was something very
inspiring in Cole Swensen's intro to American Hybrid, basically (as I took
it) that there is so much diversity now in poetry that it is kind of
incoherent to think about being influenced by 'the influences,' by the basic
theoretical or poetic or whatever texts of the field.  There are enough of
these 'basic' texts that the term basic cannot really apply to them.  I
think this is maybe similar to what Jameson means by impossibility of
cognitive mapping in the postmodern city as the postmodern condition.
 Swensen seemed to be saying that the excess of influences means that what
makes a poet strong is the decision by which specific influences are
selected from the larger set, and the field of influence is thus reduced to
a manageable field.  In my experience, what can make workshop poetry bad is
lack of specific influence.  In other words, if the poet has not selected
something particular, such as the work of certain theorists, painters, etc.,
to be influenced by, and studied it.  This commitment to a particular
influence, and the concomitant risk of not-studying something else with the
same time, I think is a good application of Badiou's concept of "fidelity"
in Being and Event.  Without choosing a fidelity, however idiosyncratic it
may be, poets will fall into a relatively homogenous voice (or lack
thereof).  At least by doing this, they define a situation out of which
venturesome, faithful, selective voices can emerge.  But I think the point
is, even among the most capacious reader-writers of the 20thc., there was
always a selection, and a fidelity tending towards a particular cut of the
spuriously conceptualized 'whole.'  (Maybe I'm being too general?)Adam Katz

Dispatch from Tehran #7






To: Retort
From: BK

Dear friends,

First of all, thanks so much for your messages! We share them with=20
friends here, and it gives us strength and morale to know we are not=20
alone!

I know these dispatches are long, but please circulate wherever you=20
think helpful, even if you don't have time to read.  It was too=20
dangerous to take photos or video today, but i'm sure there are plenty=20
of images being spread over the net. I don't do Facebook, and it has=20
been officially blocked here, but some are able to access it through=20
proxies.  It is a good minute to minute update, and somewhere we have=20
been sending our images.

b
-------------------
TEHRAN, June 14, midnight---The streets of Tehran are under siege.=20
After this coup d'etat, people are remaining in the streets, although=20
today there was severe repression and riot police everywhere.  The word=20
revolution is in everyone's mouths, and people are refusing to stay=20
indoors, as the regime and police are asking them to.  The fascist=20
apparatus is coming on full force.  Riot police are accompanied by=20
Bassiji militants, huge men with beards, dressed in emblematic khaki=20
pants and white button up shirts, with one-meter long wooden batons in=20
hand, and colt pistols.  These men, usually hidden on a 'normal' day in=20
the streets to monitor behavior and the dress code, are now working at=20
full force with the police, especially at night.

Today we mostly stayed indoors, although there were some gatherings=20
further into the city.  Because Ahmadinejad was holding an official=20
victory rally, where thousands had gathered (although as usual, many=20
were probably brought in by bus from the outskirts of the city), people=20
in opposition were encouraged to stay away.  This is mostly because=20
meeting face to face with these people would lead to violent clashes,=20
and more deaths.  Although there are no official figures, there have=20
been some deaths.  We have heard that 11 were killed yesterday, but=20
there is no way to know.

This is not an explosion or a spontaneous riot.  This is not a show of=20
anger or rage.  Something bigger is happening, and we can feel that=20
people are preparing for it.  Although there is severe repression and=20
fear, people are maintaining their presence in the streets.  This is=20
not just an angry reaction to election fraud, but a real movement that=20
is bubbling.  The slogans on the street now are mainly 'Death to=20
Dictatorship', and people are not afraid to cry this out.

Again, through some accessible weblogs (or others we get through to=20
with filters), and phone calls to others around the city, we gather=20
information. Internet has been virtually cut, although a slow dialup=20
service allows us to send a few emails or read feeds every few hours.

A short list of today's news: Moussavi is still under house arrest; his=20
wife gave a talk today at Tehran University announcing that tomorrow=20
there will be a massive demonstration (for which they will have asked=20
for a permit, which is not sure to be granted); a large number of=20
reformist leaders were arrested, threatened not to make any radical=20
moves or declarations, and then released; SMS services are still=20
deactivated, as are any wave using internet services; Ayatollah Sanei=20
(a reformist, elderly cleric) took to the streets of Qom in protest,=20
wearing a shroud that Muslims are wrapped in when they die; weblogs=20
called for people to stay in the streets and to walk calmly; Tehran and=20
Isfahan Universities were attacked by Bassij militia who severely beat=20
students.

As night fell on Tehran, we went up on the rooftop and along with=20
hundreds of other people began yelling "Death to Dictatorship".  You=20
could hear the voices in the dark across the city.  Friends who live in=20
other parts of the city reported that in their parts the same was=20
happening.  People were also yelling, "Allah Akbar" (which I personally=20
have an extremely hard time saying, but it is a tactical move for=20
people: they need to keep the support of figures like Moussavi,=20
Rafsanjani, Ayatollah Sanei, and others important within the political=20
sphere if their movement is to build and go forward with force).=20
During the 1979 revolution, the movements were leftist, but what is=20
happening today is first and foremost a fight for social and political=20
freedom.

Officially it is illegal to gather, meaning that groups of 3 or 4=20
people standing together in the street are threatened and hit with=20
batons if they don't move.  So the quiet walking continues tonight.

In our street, Bassiji militants have attacked people and beaten their=20
wooden batons onto our doors, insulting us and telling us to get back=20
in the house.  They are trying to create fear and hysteria, but people=20
continue to go outside, to walk in the streets, to drive their cars and=20
honk.  This will only grow.

But the situation is severe, and the police have been given orders to=20
kill.  That said, we are all seeing a clip today of a number of=20
protesters protecting a policeman after he was beaten by a group of=20
protesters, pleading with each other that we are all the same people,=20
that we are all in this country together.  Today, I witnessed a few=20
occasions where people were discussing with young policemen in riot=20
gear.  At one point a few friends and I conversed with a policeman in=20
his twenties.  He was ashamed, and told us that they have been told to=20
shoot to kill, but that they are
'trying hard to keep the situation calm'.  He said that he considers us=20
like his brothers and sisters; we told him to drop his weapons and join=20
our ranks.  This will hopefully happen soon.

The main problem for us is the plainclothes police, Bassijis, and=20
secret service that are stationed all over the place; on each street=20
corner, as well as around the major squares of the city.

Something is happening, slowly but surely, and the force of the people=20
will only grow each day.  Tehran, Isfahan, Mashad, Ahvaz, Shiraz,=20
Zahedan are [sic], and probably more cities in the coming days and=20
weeks.

What we want may take a long time, but it is happening.  The walls are=20
covered with "Death to Dictatorship", and it will come to an end.

Latest news:
? Helicopter police have opened fire on a crowd in Haft Tir Square (in=20
central Tehran).  We heard that this was with plastic coated bullets,=20
but this is to be confirmed.

? Tehran University is under severe attack; this is the first time that=20
the army has actually entered the university grounds in 44 years.

? The above mentioned, Ayatollah Sanei has come to Tehran from Qom and=20
is maintaining a sit in in Khomeini's home, asking others of the Ulema=20
to join him.  This is extremely important; a remnant action from the=20
Constitutional Revolution of 1906.

Dear Poetics List,

Thank you very much for helping me locate poems and anthologies on the
invasion and occupation of Iraq. I hope to correspond and form
alliances with everyone interested in using poetry and critical
writing to reframe what we know in terms of what we know rather than
what we are told in the media that we know (a starting point). There
are so many approaches to resistance and I hope to support them all in
a Guattarian critique. I will let the list know of any fruits of this
small (?) research project.

I want to thank (in order received):

Halvard Johnson, for The Sonnet Project.

Lisa Samuels, for War Holdings and 'Fire Skin with the cell phone
execution on', in The Invention of Culture.

Dan Wilcox, for "BAGHDAD/ALBANY"

Jeff Encke, for Most Wanted: A Gamble in Verse

Carrie Etter, for "The Occupation of Iraq"

Justin Katko, for leads to many British poets.

Maxine Chernoff, for "Embedded in the Language"

Francesco Levato, for "War Rug"

Philip Metres, for Behind the Lines: Poetry, War, & Peacemaking
(http://www.behindthelinespoetry.blogspot.com/) and the last chapter
of his book, Behind the Lines: War Resistance Poetry on the American
Homefront Since 1941.

Wallis Leslie, for pointing out Brian Turner's Here Bullet.

Christopher Leland Winks for pointing out Gloria Frym's collection
"Solution Simulacra" and Kent Johnson's collection Lyric Poetry after
Auschwitz.

Michael Bibby for emphasizing Brian Turner's Here Bullet, as well as
Poets Against the War, and this list itself as an archive of
responses.

William at Spineless Books suggested his press's "newspoetry" section,
and Rob Halpern's Disaster Suite.

Steve Dalachinsky, for "Beached 2"

Michelle Detorie's for the collection Bellum Letters.

Patrick Dillon, for pointing out Barrett Watten's Bad History (about
the first Gulf War), and Eliot Weinberger's What Happened Here,
especially the long poem "What I Heard about Iraq."

Rodrigo Toscano=92s "State & Sensibility," "Improvised Poetics Device
(IPD)," "Inaguraci=F3n" (Inauguration), "Exaltado"  (Jumpy), and
=93Tacitus=94 and =93Cicero=94 in To Leveling Swerve.

Luke Roberts, for many suggestions of poets and criticism especially
in the UK, including an essay by Andrea Brady, "Grief Work in a War
Economy."


Thank you everyone!

Hi guys, here is a review by Thurston Moore form the rock band Sonic
Youth...

3. For whatever reason, new jazz/improv disks have not been finding us as
regularly as they once did. Maybe we complained about the format too much,
and since no one apart from SIWA, QBICO, Eremite and a coupla other places
even understand that jazz should be available on LP, it=92s usually no big
deal. But recent car travel has made CDs a somewhat more useful format (at
least in the short term), and we got these three new things from the
Porter Records label (previously noted for reissuing a few key
Philadelphia pieces), and figured they=92d ride as well as anything. And
they did. Opus de Life by Profound Sound Trio which documents a show from
June =9208. Saxophonist for the date is Englishman Paul Dunmall, who double=
s
on bagpipes, and really blows like a maniac. Long mired in my brain as a
second tier freebopper, Dunmall presents a much weirder surface here than
expected, creating raw melodicism with an almost primitive grace. The
rhythm section is Andrew Cyrille and Henry Grimes (Cecil Taylor=92s
legendary Blue Note-era backline). Cyrille sounds as good as
always=97alternately multi-dimensional and hammy=97and Grimes puts in a ver=
y
solid arco-heavy performance on bass and violin. Had not paid much
attention to the rediscovered Grimes, but his work here is fine. Julu
Twine by Alan Sondheim and Myk Freedman finds Sondheim=92s various strings
(he=92s been playing, writing and creating in various fields since the earl=
y
=9260s) paired with Freedman=92s lap steel to lovely weird effect. Tones ge=
t
bent so far they curl back on themselves, and eternity=92s whistle is alway=
s
just a psychedelic heartbeat away. Sondheim=92s reactivated musical career
has been very interesting to track, and this album=92s a good one. Not jazz=
,
but good. Even less jazzic is Folkanization by Francesco Giannico. This
young Italian electro-acoustic composer in whose work we can hear tendrils
of everything from Luigi Nono to Toru Takemitsu. Filled with odd details,
the music is fascinating. Good for the car, anyway.

Attractive arrangements, but far too literary.  Try making some pieces where
your "symbols" don't stand in for ideas but are non-language based.

Another of my favorite outsider visual poets was a man named David
Barkus who lived on the streets of Madison in the 80s.  Still haven't
tracked down what happened to him.  He was convinced, among other
things, that he was a leprechaun & could speak & write in
leprechaunese.  For the record, he did have a twinkle in his eyes &
unexplained things were certain to happen around him.  Xexoxial
published his one & only book, basically an anthology of pages from a
few of his notebooks.  He asked that the book be published under his
leprechaun name, Gazaliel, tho no one knew him by that name.  I've put
up a pdf of the book so more folks could see what he was doing.  It's
apparent when seeing these pages that he was spontaneously collaging a
lot of known alphabets, which I think he had taught himself at some
point.  I often times saw him writing & not once did I see him copying
a script from a book.

Camille Paglia in "Sex/Art/& American Culture" wrote about how (to paraphra=

the richness of pop/American culture. Her argument, not very convincing, al=

Hello everyone,

Some excellent news:

June 16 =96 Jeramy Dodds wins Trillium Book Award for Poetry!
Debut poetry collection, also shortlisted for the Griffin Prize, tops =20=

year=92s Ontario poetry titles

Jeramy Dodds=92s debut poetry collection, Crabwise to the Hounds, was =20=

announced the winner of the Trillium Book Award for Poetry. The =20
Honourable Aileen Carroll, Ontario Minister of Culture, announced the =20=

winners of the 22nd Trillium Book Awards in Toronto earlier today at a =20=

luncheon at the Park Hyatt. As winner of the Trillium Book Award for =20
Poetry, Dodds receives $10,000 and joins fellow Trilllium winners =20
Pasha Malla, Marguerite Andersen and Paul Prud'homme.

The full list of Trillium winners can be found at =
http://www.quillandquire.com/blog/index.php/2009/06/16/malla-andersen-dodd=
s-and-prudhomme-win-trillium-book-awards/=20
. Dodds will be in the Toronto area until June 23rd (when he returns =20
to Fredericton). But he returns on July 13th to read on the mainstage =20=

at the popular Scream in High Park, the cornerstone of the summer=92s =20=

Scream Literary Festival (http://www.thescream.ca).

About Crabwise to the Hounds:

With cameos by jackalopes, Glenn Gould, homemade spaceships and Carl =20
Linnaeus, these poems are astonishing for their technical agility and =20=

their restless inventiveness. There's an elegance here that matches =20
Dodds=92s impulse to challenge the reader with fresh metaphor and =20
remarkable phrasing; the formal ambitions of many of the poems in =20
Crabwise to the Hounds are balanced by an inclination toward wordplay =20=

and bright musicality.

Humorous at times, yet always handled with consummate craft, these =20
poems invoke historical figures like Hiram Bingham and Ho Chi Minh =20
even as they traverse a poetic landscape that includes telephone-game-=20=

style translations, interpretive-dance poems on historic paintings and =20=

carnivalesque jaunts into a natural world overrun with mules, =20
Alsatians, lions and motorcycle-sized deer.

Praise for Crabwise to the Hounds:

=91The most exciting Canadian debut this year, hands down.=92 =96 The =
Poetry =20
Foundation

=91There is a cyclonic lexical energy here, deep intelligence, and a =20
serious commitment to craft. His poems build and infold all at once, =20
and opposing forces create incredible tension in them: the reader=92s =20=

mouth, open in awe, next barks a disbelieving laugh.=92 =96 Griffin =
Prize =20
jury citation

=91Crabwise to the Hounds is akin to having your room lit up by sheet =20=

lightning ... [I]n this poet=92s hands language itself is a musical =20
instrument, capable of an entertaining variety of sounds, tones and =20
tempos.=92 =96 Toronto Star

=91Most remarkable about Dodds=92s writing is its resourcefulness and =20=

versatility ... his poems resonate physically with cunningly crafted =20
language while they successfully amuse the intellect. He balances =20
form, content, entertainment and ingenuity without giving any =20
indication that any ingredient is more or less important than the =20
others.=92 =96 Globe and Mail

Jeramy Dodds was born and raised in Orono, Ontario, and currently =20
lives in Fredericton. His poems have been translated into Finnish, =20
French, Latvian, Swedish, German and Icelandic. In 2007 he held a =20
residency at the Baltic Centre for Writers and Translators on the =20
island of Gotland, Sweden. He is the winner of the 2006 Bronwen =20
Wallace Memorial Award and the 2007 CBC Literary Award in poetry. He =20
has worked as a research archaeologist and co-edits for =20
littlefishcartpress. He currently teaches creative writing at the =20
University of New Brunswick.

also, check out Denis Johnson's (author Jesus's son) collected poems. It's =
about an outsider, a janitor who worked for the Musuem of American Art in W=
ashington, D.C., an artist/janitor ... beatiful work. As much as I enjoy DJ=
's novels, his poetry is at least as good.=20

In Protracted Type=2C Nico Vassilakis provides us with a stunning and exten=
sive survey of the impressive variety of his visual and conceptual work wit=
h language over the past several years.  The book is punctuated with though=
tful statements about the nature of creating that work=2C of =93finding you=
r aleatoric self among the pencils=94=3B i.e.=2C coming to grips with the p=
aradox of working subconsciously with language which is generally experienc=
ed as a conscious medium.  In one of his statements he describes his creati=
ve process as a kind of disassociation: =93I let my brain do the thinking. =
 I watch it think for me=85it makes the associations=85maybe my brain think=
s I=92m staring and is piecing the puzzle together for me.=94  This is an e=
xcellent description of the creative process at its best.
Vassilakis has explored the possibilities of visual poetry from the outer l=
imits of the purely letteral to the purely graphic=2C and the results are c=
onsistently stimulating and resonant: from enlarged and manipulated photos =
of typewriter keys and printed letters=2C to collaged cut-ups=2C to glyphic=
 drawings=2C to concrete poetry=2C to photocopier artifacts=2C Vassilakis h=
as given us a tour-de-force of styles and approaches.  This is an essential=
 work=2C and would be a bargain at three times the price.

 perception of visual poetry from minimal to maximal with letters ranging f=

Hi all:

Poetry and Cultural Studies: A Reader, edited by yours truly and Ira
Livingston, is now available. I'm hiding under my desk as i anticipate
rocks and tomatoes from people who see their favorite scholar/poet
unrepresented and/or their favorite scholar/poet's work redacted in a
way that they don't like. Nonetheless, it's available, with cover art by
our own David-Baptiste Chirot.

I was going to do the official David Bromige site. David and I had =
talked often about it and I had some bigraphical and other material here =
for it that he sent me.  I had asked Steve Tills to assist, and, of =
course, he said yes.  I'm so sorry now that it did not materialize =
before David left us.  And now that David's work is understandably and =
rightfully so in the hands of family, I have used the domain to, for =
now, just put up a goodbye to David.  If anyone would like to visit this =
simiple page, you will find it at http://davidbromigepoet.com.

Peace,
Layne

...Denis Johnson, I hope he doesn't stop writing poetry because THE THRONE OF THE THIRD HEAVEN OF THE NATIONS MILLENNIUM GENERAL ASSEMBLY was truely awesome; he wrote about an artist janitor and the lifelong project this man assembled while he worked as a janitor at the National Portrait Gallery.

I will at some point figure out how links get transferred when my email is transposed to the list.

Just go here:

http://www.geocities.com/pj_nights

for ~50 pages of free poetry (not mine even though the URL suggests so - new web address for the journal next fall)

and please send us your art and audios for the next issue.

I apologize in my last announcement of the new issue for spelling Gary Lehmann's name incorrectly and for leaving out Lynne Shapiro altogether.

Dear poets and fellow travelers --

De-lurking briefly to say that "Dear Possum," my riff on a few lines from
"The Waste Land," is at Poetry Daily today:

All good things,

I can't speak for Troy, but I don't view the "French Theorists" we're talk=
ing about here
as a monolith of ideology, but rather as a series of misadventures in
antifoundationalism. They are, as you rightly quote Butler pointing out, o=
ften
contradictory with one another in some ways, but those ways are the ways t=
hey choose
to disparage foundationalism, not their opposition to it. Where Butler (an=
d, I take it,
you) go wrong, in my view, is to assume that modes of thinking which disag=
ree with or
contradict one another about means can have no common end.

Antifoundationalism is not solely French, I think we can agree -- perhaps =
even that it
isn't French at all except that it is the French literary intellectuals in=
 the last century
who were its most recent primary sponsors, Rorty aside, and are the writer=
s under
whose influence most of the people on this list are antifoundationalist.

You also rightly point out that most poets don't read philosophy. I'd like=
 to add that
when they do, they read it like they read books about quantum physics, and=
 they get it
miserably wrong. Even among the poets who've read Russell do you know any =
who
could explain his Theory of Types? Of course one could paraphrase Byron ab=
out
Coleridge and say even Russell couldn't explain his Theory of Types, but t=
hat's not a
serious objection. Not only do most poets not read philosophy, and thus do=
n't
understand it, even those who read a little philosophy don't read it well =
or in context.

The problem, though, isn't that poets do or don't read or understand philo=
sophy. The
problem is how uncritically accepting most contemporary poets are of the
antifoundationalist view. Well, okay, that means that the problem really i=
s that poets
don't read and understand philosophy. But most poets won't read poetry -- =
so what are
the chances of getting them to read philosophy?

OK, so, my new book Advanced Elvis Course is OUT, and I do mean OUT,
as in the reviews (they're been really good reviews) are mentioning
the queer content of the book.  Well, it's making some Elvis fans
INSANE with rage that I would DARE make Elvis MY OWN, for me, as who I
am.

One dude wrote to me, "You know Elvis was straight, don't you?"

First of all, NO, I don't know that, and neither does Dude.  I think
it's VERY SAFE to say that YES, Elvis liked women, and liked them A
LOT!  But who is to say he didn't also like men?

So I wrote back to Dude, and said, "OH REALLY!?  LET'S GO OVER THE
LYRICS TO JAILHOUSE ROCK TOGETHER, SHALL WE?????"

"Spider Murphy played the tenor saxaphone
Little Joe was blowin on his slide trombone.  (yeah, BONE all right!)
The whole rhythm section was the purple gang."  PURPLE GANG?

There's not A SINGLE female pronoun or female name in this entire
song, I challenge ANYONE to find her between the tromBONE and the
purple gang!  But wait, we're not finished:

"Number 47 said to Number 3:
You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see.
I sure would be delighted with your company,
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me."

WHAT?????????  Number 47 and Number 3, those are prisoner numbers, right?
There's no such thing as a co-ed prison in 2009, and I certainly don't
believe there was one in 1957 either!  But wait, we're not finished:

"Shifty Henry said to Bugs, for heavens sake,
No ones lookin, now's our chance to make a break.
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, nix nix,
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."

BUGSY is so turned on he's not even interested in escaping when he's
got the chance!  This is SUCH A FAG SONG, GIVE ME A BREAK!

Well, as you can imagine, this did NOT go over well with Dude when I
wrote to him, to which he replied with the single word "PERVERT!"  Ah,
yes, Dude got that one right at least!

BRING IT ON BABY!

Hi all:

Poetry and Cultural Studies: A Reader, edited by yours truly and Ira
Livingston, is now available. I'm hiding under my desk as i anticipate
rocks and tomatoes from people who see their favorite scholar/poet
unrepresented and/or their favorite scholar/poet' s work redacted in a
way that they don't like. Nonetheless, it's available, with cover art by
our own David-Baptiste Chirot.

"Pretty Little Lies" by W. R. Mayo=20

Pretty Little Lies by W. R. Mayo

NEW RELEASE - AVAILABLE NOW!=20

PRETTY LITTLE LIES=20
by W. R. Mayo=20
ISBN: 978-0-9773695-4-0=20
Copyright 2009, 211 pages=20
Non-fiction and fully illustrated with 29 photographs, maps and charts with=
 extensive reference notes.=20

It is more than a history of the Eastern Arkansas Delta. It is a journey co=
vering three and half centuries from the origins of a Southern Arkansas fam=
ily through the the plantation days of slavery, the Jim Crow Era to the pre=
sent following a trail of lies, deceit and betrayal.=20

Take a pinch of Poe, mixed lightly with Faulkner and thicken with Tennessee=
 Williams and you will not find a more dysfunctional family in the Southern=
 Gothic tradition.=20

=20

Pretty Little Lies , as told from the perspective of a member of the southe=
rn Mayo clan, reads like a gothic novel spanning centuries. In a take no pr=
isoners accounting. W. R. Mayo's memoir is a serious undertaking that makes=
 for fascinating reading. Though not from an old southern family, I, for on=
e recognize much of what we all carry in our DNA.=20
- Susan Tepper, author of DEER=20

In his biting family memoir, Pretty Little Lies , W. R. Mayo courageously p=
uts a dagger into the heart of the southern plantation myth. By unflinching=
ly facing his own dysfunctional past, Mayo gives the romantic, idealized ve=
rsion of ante- and post-bellum life below the Mason-Dixon Line a well-deser=
ved paddling. In moving prose, he reveals the underbelly of the "big house"=
- a way of life created and sustained by traffic in human slavery and one r=
eliant upon the manipulation, or far worse, of the land and those who lived=
 and toiled upon it. Pretty Little Lies is a must read for anyone looking t=
o see past the mythology of the Old South.=20
- J. B. Hogan, author=20

Unflinching. Revealing. In this exhaustively researched family history, May=
o charts the rise of a Southern family from its roots in England to the fou=
nding of a plantation in Southeastern Arkansas in the middle of the ninetee=
nth century. Through the degradations of the Civil War, two world wars, and=
 countless family conflicts still raging to this day, Mayo lays bare the my=
thology of Southern "Nobility." He frankly examines the treatment of slaves=
 by his family which led to "the other Mayos," a family of blacks descended=
 from these slaves, and describes the uncompromising natures of his progeni=
tors. From his mother who never apologized for anything, considering it a w=
aste of time to his racist, domineering father, Mayo chronicles the infight=
ing, manipulation, and xenophobia prevalent in his family's past. Mayo digs=
 to the core to face head-on not only the lies, exaggerations and conscious=
-salving stories of "pride" passed down within his family, but also to unco=
ver the real story of Southern history. As Faulkner said, "The past is neve=
r dead. In fact, it's not even past." Mayo's past is certainly not dead, th=
ough this book is an attempt to put a stake through it's heart.=20
- C. L. Bledsoe, author of Anthem, Riceland and editor for Ghoti Magazine=

Cervena Barva Press announces a new book=20
"Anthem" by CL Bledsoe=20

=C2=A0 =09

CL Bledsoe has published work in over 200 journals and anthologies, includi=
ng The Cimarron Review, Nimrod and The Arkansas Review . Winner of the Blue=
 Collar Review's Working People's Poetry Contest, he is also a 3-time Pushc=
art Prize nominee. He is an editor for Ghoti Magazine . http://www.ghotimag=
.com and the author of a chapbook entitled_______(Want/Need)=20

Fresh, funny, hip, anarchic, jaded, secretly hopeful, angry, wry, laid-back=
: to read CL Bledsoe's Anthem is to enter a world that may make you twitch =
- but will surely help you keep on keeping on. These songs of punked-out in=
nocence stage-strut across the page, even when they claim they're simply sl=
acking on the couch. Join Frog and Death and the absinthe squirrels on a sa=
vvy, consciousness-jolting road-trip through the landscape of right now. I =
loved this smart and artful book. I bet you will to. Open it. Find out.=20
-Jeanne Larsen, winner of the AWP poetry book award=20


CL Bledsoe's Anthem is succinct, shrewd and contemporary. Bledsoe is a mode=
rn-age poet with the unique ability to bring the reader smack into the mome=
nt with him ... Anthem's poems are no exception. Often confessional, occasi=
onally biting, Bledsoe proves once again that he is the poet for generation=
 X, Y and whatever lies beyond.=20

Cervena Barva Press announces a new book=20
"Anezka Ceska" by Jaromir Horec=20
Translated into English by Jana Moravkova Kiely=20
as Agnes of Bohemia=20

=C2=A0=20

Jaromir Horec was born on December 18, 1921 in Chust, in Sub-Carpathian Rut=
henia, which in 1919, at the treaty of Versailles, had voted to become part=
 of the newly formed Czechoslovak Republic with an enlightened, freely elec=
ted government led by the humanist philosopher, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk.=20

Throughout the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Jarom=C3=ADr Hoec was act=
ive in the underground anti-Nazi youth movement. After World War II, Sub-Ca=
rpathian Ruthenia was not returned to Czechoslovakia but was annexed by Sta=
lin to the Soviet Union. Thus Horec, living in Prague, became an expatriate=
 in his own country. He was a prolific poet, who was not allowed to publish=
 for two periods of twenty years each: 1948-1966 and 1969-1989.=20

In 1977, he signed Charter 77 and two years later, he founded the Czech und=
erground press Ceska Expedice for which he was imprisoned in 1981. His many=
 works of poetry, include Anezka Ceska , and Chleb Na Stole , as well as ma=
ny other publications, such as Why I Am Not a Communist and Sub-Carpathian =
Ruthenia-an Unknown land have been coming out only since 1989.=20

Certainly they aren't a monolith, and anyone who says I said that they were=
 was either disingenuous or didn't understand my argument. But Marcus is ri=
ght that they are all antifoundationalists. They also tend to be anti-epist=
emologists as well. And their ideas tend to be founded in a combination of =
fascism and Marxism (read Richard Wolin's "The Seduction of Unreason" and A=
lexander Argyros' "A Blessed Rage for Order"). Further, Marcus is also righ=
t that too many poets either don't read philosophy, or don't understand wha=
t they are reading. There are a few contemporary exceptions, like Frederick=
 Fierstein and Frederick Turner, but it sadly remains the rule. He is also =
right that too many poets don't actually read much poetry, except their con=
temporaries, who also haven't read anybody. This is in no small part due to=
 the prevalence of antifoundational thinking, making people think they don'=
t have to have any sort of foundation to be an artist. The result
 tends to be a bunch of garbage that all sounds the same. Or looks the same=
, with the visual arts. =0A=0ATroy Camplin=0A=0A=0A=0A_____________________=

yeah. more accurately: Flanagan was outside of academic circles. He's had p=
lenty of recognizition, especially as a performance artist. I think Jesse H=
elms mentioned the crucified cock thing during an NEA debate. Actually, I'm=
 not necessarily sure if Flanagan nailed his cock to a cross, but if I'm no=
t mistaken, nails and pain were involved, and Helms couldn't appreciate S/M=
 mutilation. Go figure...

Arthur Rimbaud=2C =93Alchemy of the Word=94





It might be very  interesting to also have some --perhaps--who knows----at
any rate some examinations investigations questionings of "outsider
poems"=97'outsider poetry" in an anthology of this kind----


Such as when does one begin to find the lists of =93outsider
Poetry=94 such as Rimbaud=92s beginning to first appear=97in Rabelais or Vi=
llon=2C or
among the romans or Greeks--??=97

Among the =93idees recues=94 of Flaubert=92s dictionary of them
compiled by Bouvard and Pecuchet=97among the anonymous Faits divers of Feli=
x Feneon
in 1906=97al the disappeared and forgotten works which begin to beckon to o=
ne from
out of the shadowy little known or visited areas where Outsiders are said t=
o
dwell=97hidden inside fictions as among camouflaging and codes=2C so as to =
remain
hidden until the =93right person comes along and finds them . . . =93 a soo=
n to
arrive or quite distant M Champollion to translate them from Outsider langu=
ages=97=93
( these works while considered "classics" within  themselves ask questions =
which may be of use in thinking on "outsider poetry--"


 The usual journalistic questions come swarming to mind----what is Outsider=
 Poetry--when did it first appear--by whom--anonymous  or known--where--and=
 then why--why this anthology=2C why now=2C and what for--and why or when o=
r how is the editor interested in this--new territories to conquer?--to ope=
n up things not already opened or come to mind--and for whom one may ask ot=
her than as a corollary of textbooks already taught and used by poets also-=
-as yet another tome creating a whole new field of teaching jobs and essay =
production and commentaries and so on--which accompanies the outsider's pro=
cession into the insiders' worlds-- . . .=20
Perhaps the simple asking of basic journalistic questions is a good way to =
start some thinking about the "outsiders" and who and why they are and wher=
e and when and which to put inside and insider collection of outsiders . . =
. / to generate some ideas and evermore questions--else one is just going a=
long with a kind of blurry image in the mind of something called willy nill=
y an outsider by all manner oc qualifications without asking oneself what t=
he heck am i actually thinking about--in considering this or that poet

so there is a lot of work and fun and creation to be done withal these ques=
tions and there swarming descendants and proliferating extended families fo=
r sure--



Yes--as very many of these questions=2C investigations=2C
perhapses and wonderings can and do swarm into the light like moths disturb=
ed from
their somnolence in the quiet darkness of libraries where the book worms cr=
eate
a new form of writing which is the literal consumption of the texts=97creat=
ing strange
labyrinthine passages which re-write whole sections of poetry and devastate
fields of prose=97

=20

and mimic in their way certain acts of reading which eat
their way through texts leaving behind them an erased zone someday to be pa=
rt
of palimpsests of dust=2C grime=2C  or jottings
when the blank pages are reused by the recycling minded as the =93blank spa=
ces=94 to
fill with a diary=2C or an outline of an essay on the manner in which locus=
ts
resemble readers devouring texts=2C and in a much more systematic and ruthl=
ess
manner than mere book worms or moths resembling worn out scraps of old
carpeting imbued with the dust of many fortunately departed days--



Yes=2C regarding an anthology of Outsider Poetry=20
on might well ask--How much does this idea borrow from or diverge from
the original conceptions of Outsider work that began early in the  late 19t=
h-early 20th century with
artists trying to get "outside" their own culture via arts from other
cultures (Gauguin=2C Van Gogh

=2C Picasso etc) or via the discovery of a "Sunday Painter=2C a naif"
like Rousseau who could also be included in "art=2C"=2C or art from
children (Kandinsky=2C abt 1905) and then art from the mentally ill (Prinzh=
orn=2C
1922). .  . or the Surrealist uses of the dream and exquisite corpses and a=
utomatic
writings (precursors perhaps of the machine programmed writings of today us=
ed
to =93get outside of the lyric I=94--) or the uses of drugs and alcohol to =
create =93out
of the same old same old mind experiences=94 so to speak=97and then Dubuffe=
t=92s concepts
and collection of Art Brut first announced in 1947=97



There are a huge number of ways to examine what is "outsider poetry"
depending on the cultural construction=2C as well as the academic=2C poetic=
=2C social
constructions that one brings to the concept=2C the idea=2C the image of wh=
at
"outsider poetry" is or is not=2C or could be etc=97



There=92s also an immense worldwide phenomena across many media and arts of
"the outsider artist and his/her works" in art magazines=2C lit mags=2C
among musicians and record collectors=2C buyers of "primitive" or
"self taught" artists' creations--al of these have contributed to the
vast explosion of a now very widespread popular appreciation of and deliber=
ate creation
of "outsider works"  as an  "underground=2C legendary
source" of some of the works considered to be "extraordinary=2C different=
=2C
outside the usual run of things=2C brut"--from the past=2C the present--and=
 maybe
even in a sort of Futurism based on the sense that what exists in the Prese=
nt
is a "ruins in reverse" of the future--when the present is taken to
be a "construction site" from which building s emerge=97

Yes=2C out of art brut and outsider works for a long time have
the professional or amateur =93artists =93of the non-brut variety found ins=
piration=2C
solace=2C the recognition of a =93fellow spirit=2C=94 Just as they do with =
non-Outsiders
except the Outsider comes with far less cultural baggage=97at least for a w=
hile--



What then would make "outsider poetry" different from the other
"outsider works and artists?"  What then might be the meta
literature of outsider works like that of Roberto Bolano's book Nazi Litera=
ture
of the Americas=2C whose last section led to the novella Distant Star in wh=
ich
exists such "outsiders" as the Barbaric Writers=2C fan zines of
football teams that aspire to a kind of super aggressive poetry=2C bizarre
motorcycle white power club mags on badly printed low quality papers----and=
 so
on-or those produced as de luxe =93vanity editions=94 to the select few--



Then there are the various approaches to what a French writer  has called "=
The Literature of the
No=2C" which  I have worked in for a
while now and been ecstatic to begin finding it in the work of  other write=
rs such as Edgardo Vila-Matas and
M. Berube-as well as a long tradition going back especially to some example=
s in
the travel Literature of the 17th century---this is the
"Bartlebys and Company" branch of the unwritten and--al the same
perhaps readable texts--the areas of the unreadable which will someday emer=
ge
as readable or the unwritten which is ultimately written by a completely
different person as though "taking dictation" from an unknown
source--a voice=2C a trace among spider webs "blowing in the wind"--



then there could be the question of the history of the recognitions of an
outsider poetry at different epochs--say beginning at one period and ever s=
ince
the uses and interests of such an Outsider text as the confessional  writin=
gs of the condemned serial killer Gilles
de Rais=2C or that of "peasant writers" in several European countries
"coming to light" during the Age of Enlightenment--

Speaking in tongues--might have found through its immensely long history
various ways other than Zaum which attempted to create/included in itself
something akin to this in writing?--



Then there is the language and writings of it given to puppets=2C Guignol=
=2C the
works written with much use of slang like Celine and Genet--and  ones who a=
re more extreme by far--so many many
others now in the usa alone--in which there=92s the return to the kind of j=
argon
used by Villon whcih not long after begins to decay in its being able to be
understood and turns then into a form of writing "outside" the very
words around it=97

=20

one could include as Outsider Poetry could one not the
immense amount of writing which is right on the paintings and objects of ar=
t
brut=97which is quite like the book of Kells as redone say by the pre-persp=
ective
=93primitive=94 painters of Italy=2C whose works are like forerunners to co=
mic
strips=97with the writing of what the personages are saying underneath the =
image=2C
esp of Holy persons=2C the Holy Family and Saints and so forth=97

(I am for the most part limiting this to Western examples=97as
that is what i am more familiar with--)

=20

Outsider writing/poetry could be that done in Mail Art by
the writings and stampings collaged images and quotations from magazinzes a=
nd
newspapers =96

=20

The question of what is Outsider Poetry=97and according to
whom=2C and why=97and at what time in art historical and in literary histor=
ical and
in historical time=97al of these play a prt do they not in considering what=
 or
may not be =91Outsider poetry=97=93

=20

In Visual Poetry=2C my works are accepted as =93visual poetry=94
though at a kind of extreme (=93the dirtiest of the dirty=94 according to G=
eof Huth
and =2C with Bob Cobbing=2C part of the =93extreme school of Quick=92nDirty=
=94 by jw
curry)=97

But when one asks about whereone might display them=2C as soon
as they are moved from one realm (poetry=2C visual poetry) to another=97the=
 visual
strictly=2C the become immediately called =93art brut=94 or =93punk art bru=
t=92 etc

=20

In writing how then does one qualify an outsider poet=97by
many criteria of a person=92s life and influences an the effects methods an=
d
interests and style of the writing=2C a person like Bill burroughs and myse=
lf are
lumped as a form of =93outsider=94 writer off in the darker areas close to =
the
=93Poetes Maudits=94=97

=20

Yet one might also say=97yes but =96despite the other
qualifications these birds pass without question=2C what about other factor=
s
involved--??=97the same with jean genet or a writer like Mohamed Choukri wh=
o was illiterate
until age twenty and went straight from illiteracy to writing in classical
Arabic=2C as genet wrote in Classical Racinien French=97

=20

Yet they are considered also Outsiders due to
thebackgr9unds=2C life story=97

So it al a much more complex and swarming area=97to really
extend the questions of I wd think=97or hope=97because otherwise why do an
anthology of outsider poetry now=2C at this moment other than perhaps=2C si=
nce
writing is always fifty or more years behind painting=97

To only now =93catch the wave=94 of a guaranteed mass
appeal--and throw together an anthology of something vaguely called an
=93Outsider poetry=94 =96

Isn=92t it important to present some ideas of what Outsider is
in poetry what might be different from it than in other arts=97or=97to make=
 use of
these for forms of thinking on works that aren=92t outsider ones=97either w=
hat I
call =93Fauxk Art=94 type writing or the neo-Brute =2C or the  Nostalgic po=

or a =93kind of ruin of the images of the old west=94 down to the fake Faux=
k --yes=2C
one can indeed fake the fauxk!!!--wagon wheel in the corner to be immortali=
zed
in a harsh yet =91swinging=92 meter based indeed on Western Swing music=97

That is=2C one can INVENT all manner of outsider Writers just
as Borges did to a good and powerful extent and Bola=F1o=2C Berube=2C Vila-=
Matas and
myself invent them whole sale=97out of whole cloth=97because even the ficti=

****Please not the change of length and cost for this amazing workshop****


Conceptualism and Craft with K. Silem Mohammad
CCA San Francisco Campus
*WEDNESDAY JULY 8TH ONLY*
Time: 6pm-9pm
*$40 / $30 students and members*

This *one-day* workshop will begin by examining and rehearsing various
techniques central to Conceptualist poetics, broadly considered so as to
encompass appropriation, transcription, and other versions of what Kenneth
Goldsmith has called =93uncreative writing,=94 as well as the deliberately
awkward and expressively debased gestures associated with Flarf. We will
then look at these techniques in relation to older and more traditional
notions of craft: can there be coherent criteria for craft-based evaluation
of texts written using blankly conceptual or intentionally =93bad=94 method=
s? Do
any of the familiar aesthetic categories still apply, and if so, how?

K. Silem Mohammad is the author of three books of poetry: Breathalyzer (Edg=
e
Books, 2008), A Thousand Devils (Combo Books, 2004), and Deer Head Nation
(Tougher Disguises, 2003). His work has been featured in numerous journals
and anthologies, including The Best American Poetry 2004, Bay Poetics, and =
A
Best of Fence, as well as the forthcoming Flarf: An Anthology of Flarf,
which he is co-editing with Sharon Mesmer, Nada Gordon, and Gary Sullivan.
With Anne Boyer, he edits the poetry magazine Abraham Lincoln. He is
Associate Professor of English and Writing at Southern Oregon University in
Ashland.

Jacket magazine: John Tranter, editor -- Pam Brown, Associate Editor:

JAcket 37 is growing, and more items will appear through June and July
2009. In accord with Jacket's long-standing tradition of tardiness,
this issue is a little late this year. Apart from accepting the
editor's humble apologies, we advise you to invest in this opportunity
to practise the skills of "patient waiting"! A week or two of "patient
waiting" is guaranteed to elevate your Good Karma(R) rating by up to
forty per cent, make beautiful people fall in love with you -- even
against their will!! -- completely cure those unsightly nasal warts,
and reduce your next "community work" probational sentence for
shoplifting or animal assault by three to four weeks. Come on, do it
now!

You can browse the issue as it is being built -- as we speak:

**Boog City
http://www.welcometoboogcity.com

Boog City is a New York City-based small press now in its 18th year =20
and East Village community newspaper of the same name. It has also =20
published 35 volumes of poetry and various magazines, featuring work =20
by Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, and theme =20
issues on baseball, women=92s writing, and Louisville, Ky. It hosts and =20=

curates two regular performance series=97d.a. levy lives: celebrating =20=

the renegade press, where each month a non-NYC small press and its =20
writers and a musical act of their choosing is hosted at Chelsea=92s ACA =
=20
Galleries; and Classic Albums Live, where up to 13 local musical acts =20=

perform a classic album live at venues including The Bowery Poetry =20
Club, Cake Shop, CBGB=92s, and The Knitting Factory. Past albums have =20=

included Elvis Costello, My Aim is True; Nirvana, Nevermind; and Liz =20

Jim Behrle lives in Brooklyn.


**John Coletti

John Coletti is the author of The New Normalcy (Boog Literature), =20
Physical Kind (Yo-Yo-Labs), and Same Enemy Rainbow (fewer & further).


**Dibson T. Hoffweiler
http://www.myspace.com/dibson

The latest in a long line of quirky anti-folk ingenues, including =20
Beck, Adam Green and Jeffrey Lewis, Dibs applies that time-honored =20
tradition of off-beat songwriting to his own private world of sugar =20
factories, laundry baskets and ducks. With a low voice, both sweet and =20=

deadpan, and a guitar-style both virtuosic and sloppy, Dibson =20
Hoffweiler carves out a space of compassion and intelligence in a =20
landscape of boring love songs and thinly-veiled songwriterly misogyny.


**I feel tractor
http://www.myspace.com/ifeeltractor

I feel tractor performs music to "make your children feel funky like a =20=

donkey."


**Bob Kerr

Bob Kerr was a founding member of the Minneapolis band Alien =20
Detector.  He has written songs for his plays Meet Uncle Casper, =20
Kingdom Gone, and End Times, and wrote the book and lyrics for the 10-=20=

minute musical The Sticky-Fingered Fianc=E9e.


**Limp Richard
http://www.myspace.com/toddcarlstrom

Limp Richard's alter ego, Todd Carlstrom, has played in NYC bands for =20=

years (The Domestics, Heroes of the Alamo, Dirty Vicars, and =20
currently, Todd Carlstrom and the Clamour). Limp rarely performs live, =20=

preferring to wait until Boog City presses him into service. His =20
influences include, but are not limited to, squid, bacon, epilepsy =20
medication, and the guy sitting next to you as you read this. He is =20
managed by the beautiful, but criminally pathological, Remorah.


**Arlo Quint
http://www.puppyflowers.com/9/quint.html

Arlo Quint is the author of Days On End (Open 24 Hours) and Photogenic =20=

Memory (Lame House).


**Douglas Rothschild

Douglas Rothschild's life has been one long miasma of failure, =20
disappointment, coffee, and overarching desire. Though he has not yet =20=

accomplished anything of note, Mr. Rothschild intends to continue on =20
for some time yet. Some of this life, such as it is, has been =20
chronicled in Bill Luoma's Works & Days and Jennifer Moxley's The =20
Middle Room.

BERNADETTE MAYER & PHILIP GOOD invite you to participate in a weekend workshop on Experimental Poetics. Their home, once a synagogue in days of yore, is located in rural Upstate New York on the historic acreage between Kinderhook and Tsatsawassa creeks at the foothills of the Berkshires.

Exclusive weekend workshop sessions continue throughout the summer months culminating on the weekend of Oct 10-12. The fee, which includes accommodations, as well as all meals & activities, is $400 (double reservation) or $225 (per person). Since each weekend session is limited to four participants, please RSVP well in-advance. Any inquiries may be sent to the contact information provided below. Guests arrive Friday afternoon and depart Sunday after lunch.

There will be writing assignments with plenty of time for casual conversation.  Bernadette Mayer will discuss her Experiments List and encourage participants to expand their poetics to greater levels. The central focus in the workshop will be in-depth Investigations of Traditional Forms Made New. In addition, each participant will receive constructive feedback about their overall work through individual consultation; and all participants will be given an expansive list of reading recommendations. At the conclusion of the weekend the group will collate their new poems into a stapled poetry magazine.

To Reserve/Confirm availabilities, please email poetswksp@yahoo.com.

Bernadette Mayer (born May 12, 1945 in Brooklyn, NY) is a poet and prose writer. In 1967, she received a BA from New School for Social Research. She has since edited the journal 0 TO 9 with Vito Acconci and the United Artists Press with Lewis Warsh, and worked as Director of St. Mark's Poetry Project. She is also known for her wonderful dancing.

This year Bauhaus celebrates its 90th Anniversary.  "Bauhaus: 90 Years / 90
Days" is a new project which celebrates the Bauhaus movement; it will take
place over 90 days. During this 90-day period -- which will begin next month
-- projects will happen which will commemorate & pay homage to Bauhaus in
different ways. Those could include a dance performance inspired by Oskar
Schlemmer's ballet, a musical performance that uses a Kandinsky painting as
a graphic score, a poem inspired by Walter Gropius' architecture, a short
story inspired by Marianne Brandt's work, a video inspired by a Josef Albers
painting, and other possibilities.

Please feel free to contact me at dgodston@gmail.com if you are interested
in finding out more about "Bauhaus: 90 Years / 90 Days." Thanks!

ED SANDERS : GLYPHS 1962-2009

A rare exhibition of nearly half a century of Ed Sanders?s glyph-poems
produced between 1962 and 2009 will be on display at The Arm in Williamsbur=
g
[Brooklyn, NY] from July 10 through July 31. An opening reception will be
held on July 10th at 6PM.

Building on a long history of utilizing a highly visible language that
continues into the present, Sanders?s glyph-poems fuse image with text, and
image as text. Political, personal, ephemeral, historical, uncanny, and
humorous=A1=AAthe glyph-poems on display at The Arm appear in several different
mediums, including original drawings, collages, mimeographed pages from Fuc=
k
You/ A Magazine of the Arts (1962-'65), plus a number featuring color
images, and an artist?s book. Over 200 Glyph-works will be featured in the
show.

In addition, Glyphs 1962-2009 will feature new letterpress prints and a
limited edition catalogue produced on location at The Arm.

Edward Sanders is a poet, historian and musician. He is at work, since 1998=
,
on a 9-volume America, a History in Verse. The first five volumes, tracing
the history of the 20th century, have been completed and published in a
fully indexed CD format, over 2,000 pages in length, by Blake Route Press.
Another recent writing project is Poems for New Orleans, a book and CD on
the history of that great city, and its tribulations during and after
hurricane Katrina. He has been granted a Guggenheim fellowship in poetry, a
National Endowment for the Arts fellowship in verse, an American Book Award
for his collected poems, and other awards for his writing. Other books in
print include Tales of Beatnik Glory (4 volumes published in a single
edition), 1968, a History in Verse; The Poetry and Life of Allen Ginsberg,
The Family, a history of the Charles Manson murder group, and Chekhov, a
biography in verse of Anton Chekhov.

Sanders was the founder of the satiric folk/rock group, The Fugs, which has
released many albums and CDs during its 45 year history. The Fugs have
recently completed a CD, Be Free, The Fugs Final CD (Part 2), featuring 14
new tunes. Be Free will be released in late summer. Two of Sanders' books,
The Family and Tales of Beatnik Glory, are under option to be made into
movies. His selected poems, 1986-2008, Let?s Not Keep Fighting the Trojan
War will be published by Coffee House Press in the fall of 2009. He lives i=
n
Woodstock, New York with his wife, the essayist and painter Miriam Sanders,
and both are active in environmental and other social issues. Sanders will
perform a section of America, the 17th Century, tracing the voyage of Henry
Hudson up the Hudson River in 1609, at the Byrdcliffe Art Colony in
Woodstock on August 8, as part of the 400th anniversary celebration of
Hudson?s discoveries.

Opening reception for Glyphs 1962-2009 on Friday, July 10th from 6PM.

but so much remains invisible.

invisibility, isn't that outsider art?
are there any taboos left?
any area of the human psyche still unexplored?

any socio-economic wound in need of further artistic flagellation?

does the invisible artist yearn to be seen?
doesn't any artist wish that his/her work is seen?

=C2=A0think of Philippe Petit, his ultimate dance with death, as he became =
in the most literal sense an outlaw artist walking the high wire illegally =
rigged between the New York World Trade center's twin towers.=20

outlaw art, not art that is merely deemed obscene (if such a thing is still=
 possible), but art which literally breaks the law ...
... guirilla art, activist art, art which seeks to destroy ...

is it still possible to shock the goddamn bougeoise?

home invasion art/identity theft art/art that imitates anything at anytime =
but remains as insignificant as...

Yes, regarding an anthology of Outsider Poetry=20
on might well ask--How much does this idea borrow from or diverge from
the original conceptions of Outsider work that began early in the=C2=A0 lat=
e 19th-early 20th century with
artists trying to get "outside" their own culture via arts from other
cultures (Gauguin, Van Gogh

, Picasso etc) or via the discovery of a "Sunday Painter, a naif"
like Rousseau who could also be included in "art,", or art from
children (Kandinsky, abt 1905) and then art from the mentally ill (Prinzhor=
n,
1922). .=C2=A0 . or the Surrealist uses of the dream and exquisite corpses =
and automatic
writings (precursors perhaps of the machine programmed writings of today us=
ed
to =E2=80=9Cget outside of the lyric I=E2=80=9D--) or the uses of drugs and=
 alcohol to create =E2=80=9Cout
of the same old same old mind experiences=E2=80=9D so to speak=E2=80=94and =
then Dubuffet=E2=80=99s concepts
and collection of Art Brut first announced in 1947=E2=80=94



There are a huge number of ways to examine what is "outsider poetry"
depending on the cultural construction, as well as the academic, poetic, so=
cial
constructions that one brings to the concept, the idea, the image of what
"outsider poetry" is or is not, or could be etc=E2=80=94



There=E2=80=99s also an immense worldwide phenomena across many media and a=
rts of
"the outsider artist and his/her works" in art magazines, lit mags,
among musicians and record collectors, buyers of "primitive" or
"self taught" artists' creations--al of these have contributed to the
vast explosion of a now very widespread popular appreciation of and deliber=
ate creation
of "outsider works"=C2=A0 as an=C2=A0 "underground, legendary
source" of some of the works considered to be "extraordinary, different,
outside the usual run of things, brut"--from the past, the present--and may=
be
even in a sort of Futurism based on the sense that what exists in the Prese=
nt
is a "ruins in reverse" of the future--when the present is taken to
be a "construction site" from which building s emerge=E2=80=94

Yes, out of art brut and outsider works for a long time have
the professional or amateur =E2=80=9Cartists =E2=80=9Cof the non-brut varie=
ty found inspiration,
solace, the recognition of a =E2=80=9Cfellow spirit,=E2=80=9D Just as they =
do with non-Outsiders
except the Outsider comes with far less cultural baggage=E2=80=94at least f=
or a while--



What then would make "outsider poetry" different from the other
"outsider works and artists?"=C2=A0 What then might be the meta
literature of outsider works like that of Roberto Bolano's book Nazi Litera=
ture
of the Americas, whose last section led to the novella Distant Star in whic=
h
exists such "outsiders" as the Barbaric Writers, fan zines of
football teams that aspire to a kind of super aggressive poetry, bizarre
motorcycle white power club mags on badly printed low quality papers----and=
 so
on-or those produced as de luxe =E2=80=9Cvanity editions=E2=80=9D to the se=
lect few--



Then there are the various approaches to what a French writer=C2=A0 has cal=
led "The Literature of the
No," which=C2=A0 I have worked in for a
while now and been ecstatic to begin finding it in the work of=C2=A0 other =
writers such as Edgardo Vila-Matas and
M. Berube-as well as a long tradition going back especially to some example=
s in
the travel Literature of the 17th century---this is the
"Bartlebys and Company" branch of the unwritten and--al the same
perhaps readable texts--the areas of the unreadable which will someday emer=
ge
as readable or the unwritten which is ultimately written by a completely
different person as though "taking dictation" from an unknown
source--a voice, a trace among spider webs "blowing in the wind"--



then there could be the question of the history of the recognitions of an
outsider poetry at different epochs--say beginning at one period and ever s=
ince
the uses and interests of such an Outsider text as the confessional=C2=A0 w=
ritings of the condemned serial killer Gilles
de Rais, or that of "peasant writers" in several European countries
"coming to light" during the Age of Enlightenment--

Speaking in tongues--might have found through its immensely long history
various ways other than Zaum which attempted to create/included in itself
something akin to this in writing?--



Then there is the language and writings of it given to puppets, Guignol, th=
e
works written with much use of slang like Celine and Genet--and=C2=A0 ones =
who are more extreme by far--so many many
others now in the usa alone--in which there=E2=80=99s the return to the kin=
d of jargon
used by Villon whcih not long after begins to decay in its being able to be
understood and turns then into a form of writing "outside" the very
words around it=E2=80=94

=20

one could include as Outsider Poetry could one not the
immense amount of writing which is right on the paintings and objects of ar=
t
brut=E2=80=94which is quite like the book of Kells as redone say by the pre=
-perspective
=E2=80=9Cprimitive=E2=80=9D painters of Italy, whose works are like forerun=
ners to comic
strips=E2=80=94with the writing of what the personages are saying underneat=
h the image,
esp of Holy persons, the Holy Family and Saints and so forth=E2=80=94

(I am for the most part limiting this to Western examples=E2=80=94as
that is what i am more familiar with--)

=20

Outsider writing/poetry could be that done in Mail Art by
the writings and stampings collaged images and quotations from magazinzes a=
nd
newspapers =E2=80=93

=20

The question of what is Outsider Poetry=E2=80=94and according to
whom, and why=E2=80=94and at what time in art historical and in literary hi=
storical and
in historical time=E2=80=94al of these play a prt do they not in considerin=
g what or
may not be =E2=80=98Outsider poetry=E2=80=94=E2=80=9C

=20

In Visual Poetry, my works are accepted as =E2=80=9Cvisual poetry=E2=80=9D
though at a kind of extreme (=E2=80=9Cthe dirtiest of the dirty=E2=80=9D ac=
cording to Geof Huth
and , with Bob Cobbing, part of the =E2=80=9Cextreme school of Quick=E2=80=
=99nDirty=E2=80=9D by jw
curry)=E2=80=94

But when one asks about whereone might display them, as soon
as they are moved from one realm (poetry, visual poetry) to another=E2=80=
=94the visual
strictly, the become immediately called =E2=80=9Cart brut=E2=80=9D or =E2=
=80=9Cpunk art brut=E2=80=99 etc

=20

In writing how then does one qualify an outsider poet=E2=80=94by
many criteria of a person=E2=80=99s life and influences an the effects meth=
ods and
interests and style of the writing, a person like Bill burroughs and myself=
 are
lumped as a form of =E2=80=9Coutsider=E2=80=9D writer off in the darker are=
as close to the
=E2=80=9CPoetes Maudits=E2=80=9D=E2=80=94

=20

Yet one might also say=E2=80=94yes but =E2=80=93despite the other
qualifications these birds pass without question, what about other factors
involved--??=E2=80=94the same with jean genet or a writer like Mohamed Chou=
kri who was illiterate
until age twenty and went straight from illiteracy to writing in classical
Arabic, as genet wrote in Classical Racinien French=E2=80=94

=20

Yet they are considered also Outsiders due to
thebackgr9unds, life story=E2=80=94

So it al a much more complex and swarming area=E2=80=94to really
extend the questions of I wd think=E2=80=94or hope=E2=80=94because otherwis=
e why do an
anthology of outsider poetry now, at this moment other than perhaps, since
writing is always fifty or more years behind painting=E2=80=94

To only now =E2=80=9Ccatch the wave=E2=80=9D of a guaranteed mass
appeal--and throw together an anthology of something vaguely called an
=E2=80=9COutsider poetry=E2=80=9D =E2=80=93

Isn=E2=80=99t it important to present some ideas of what Outsider is
in poetry what might be different from it than in other arts=E2=80=94or=E2=
=80=94to make use of
these for forms of thinking on works that aren=E2=80=99t outsider ones=E2=
=80=94either what I
call =E2=80=9CFauxk Art=E2=80=9D type writing or the neo-Brute , or the=C2=

That is, one can INVENT all manner of outsider Writers just
as Borges did to a good and powerful extent and Bola=C3=B1o, Berube, Vila-M=

myself invent them whole sale=E2=80=94out of whole cloth=E2=80=94because ev=

i'm very sorry to hear that gerry gilbert has died. i am a fan of his
writing.

poetry, the trick to read what can't be read,
quick to write what can't be said.
(from his book 'azure blues')

his work is very smart, fun, political, musical, for the page, for the
voice, informed, technically accomplished, global, local...he was an
extrordinarily committed poet.

i used to listen to his show radiofreerainforest on cfro fm in vancouver.
and catch his readings on the odd occassion he came to victoria.

one time i arranged a reading for him in victoria. he was "living on hugs"
at that point. as always, he read/performed his work with the polish and
style of the life-long poet he was.

he was the real thing folks. like bill bissett, he never won the prominent
poetry awards in canada. but he is one of my faves.

my condolences to his family and to the vancouver folks for whom gerry was a
very special voice and presence.

rob mclennan put some links together concerning gerry's work at

Subject:      This Friday: Manhatten in San Francisco!

Hi all,=A0A reminder that there's=A0a launch for my book "Manhatten" this F=
riday, June 26:=A07:30pmCanessa Park Gallery, 708 Montgomery (x Washington)=
 in=A0San Francisco$3-$5 door fee to support Canessa reading series

Reading with me from Manhatten=A0will be poets Dana Teen Lomax, Erin Wilson=
, Jono Schneider, Andrew Felsinger, and Lauren Schiffman. Bay Area musician=
 Steve Musial will perform on=A0classical guitar. Wine, tea, other non-alc =
bevs, and desserts will be served.
Parking in the immediate vicinity is usually findable; here's a garage just=
 in case:=A0http://www.sfpsg.com/directions.php

Gallery website: (http://www.canessa.org/)

Map:=A0http://www.mapquest.com/maps?city=3DSan+Francisco&state=3DCA&address=
=3D708+Montgomery

The book is available at http://www.spdbooks.org and=A0http://www.amazon.co=
m.
=A0From the jacket:This is not the mythic Manhattan of bright lights and gl=
itz. It is called Manhatten and it is wonderfully out of kilter. In this mi=
xed-genre book (fiction, poetry, review), Sarah Rosenthal layers headlong, =
voice-driven prose with silent, otherly poems to tell a story of an island =
where relationships are disturbed yet meaningful and luminous. --Juliana Sp=
ahr

Proudly misspelled, Manhatten chronicles the adventures of a young woman as=
 she searches for her life story in the ultimate American metropolis. The h=
eroine--who may or may not be author Sarah Rosenthal--leads the reader into=
 one scene after another filled with family, friends, chance acquaintances,=
 exes, and current love interests, where relationships and geography intert=
wine and memories collect on every street corner. As keen and insistent as =
the city it describes, this writing attains a clarity fueled by hunger for =
insight and language's tonal responsiveness. Spanning two coasts, leaping w=
hole decades in a single clause, Manhatten documents the rush of events and=
 the meditative spaces between, negotiating a life complete with all its en=
chantments, illusions, intersections, and collisions. --Pamela Lu

I like Sarah Rosenthal's Manhatten because it's generous with self. Also al=
armingly well written. And best of all, Manhatten awkwardly and beautifully=
 makes the claim that heterosexuals are human too! --Eileen Myles

Thanks,
Sarah

Subject:      12 or 20 questions, second series;

On June 1, I started posting on my blog (with a couple of other online
hosts thrown in, for good measure) a second series of interviews with Canadian
and American (etcetera) poets, fiction and non-fiction writers as the "12
or 20 questions" series, as a follow-up to the original series that ran
from September 2007 to June 2008, a series that held 175 interviews with
various authors. The second series includes interviews (so far) with Jason
Dewinetz, Matthew Tierney, Sandra Ridley, Jacob McArthur Mooney, Carrie
Olivia Adams, Dayle Furlong, Antanas Sileika, Sharon Harris, Ken McGoogan,
Daniel Allen Cox, J.R. Carpenter, Anita Dolman, Ray Hsu, Karen Houle,
Susan Olding, Jeanette Lynes, Asher Ghaffar and Zachariah Wells.

Interviews are still forthcoming with Peter Norman, Eric Baus, Betsy
Struthers, Graham Foust, Steven Mayoff, Mike Spry, Kevin Killian, Charles
Bernstein, Forrest Gander, Chris Ewart, Andrew Faulkner, Mary Pinkoski,
Rebecca Rosenblum, Arielle Greenberg, Peter Richardson, Eva Moran, Ken
Sparling, ross priddle, Michelle Berry, Stephen Henighan, Annabel Lyon, and
plenty of others.

The series as a whole, with links to invidiaul interviews (to be updated
every day or three over the next six months or so), lives here:

There has just released Planned, the first full-length book of poetry by
Sarah Trott. It is an evocative look at how the American Dream, a
three-bedroom house with a two-car garage on a quiet cul-de-sac, became a
national obsession with a nightmarish hangover. And nowhere was that more
true than Northern California.

http://www.therejournal.com/ordersarahtrottplanned.html

Born and raised in California, Sarah Trott=92s writing has been featured in
journals and anthologies including Watchword, There, Cricket Online Review
and Crux among others. This is her first full-length publication. She
teaches high school in Richmond, California, and lives in San Francisco.

once a society has accepted torture on a routine basis, indeifnite
detentions, loss of habeus corpus, the sacrifice ongoing of individuals
rights of freedoms for the security of the corporations and the fixers who
run the govt--
language is losing its power to even "take a stand" and so is hiding away-
"the new mccarthyism" makes it way thoughout the land--
and the tyranny which one does not see is the one that is themost
tyrannncial
--one can no longer see it or hear it and  it is banned-to utter any
doubts--or critiques-for are we notturly inthe best of all possible worlds,
willnot the economy get better beforeyou know it?--

Poetry, Language, Arts and Torture are along with Guantanamo,
Palestine/Israel, and arts of al media from around the world
including my own clay impression spray paintings, rubBEings, collages, etc
with focus on Visual/Sound Poetries, Poetry, Visual Arts & Music
there's always a lot on sidebars--right now flckr streams of Iranin stencal=
,
graf, street arts, one from th iranian artist A1One
Gaza, what's left after latest ethnic cleansing attack, american bombing of
140 people in afghanistan, american punk garage (music)
a roberto bolano short story, and lots of news and essays reports videos
a piece from an ongoing series which is basically when finsihed going to be
one re the internet
and one re the history of american electricty from ben franklin to abu
ghraib, gunatanamo bagram
these pieces & deletion from the web series is on the deletion of persons
and lands fro the world online and off)-have been appearing through the las=
t
four years on the blog and in ejournals, print--
these are interwoven with art works, poetry, documents, fotos etc-
athey are accompanioed online and in print b the ongoiing series of stories
re "El Colonel"
"The New Extreme Experimental American Poetry & Arts"
"from the electric chair to the bean bag chair--"

i believe that the language and culture of a society are prfoundly
"speaking, writing,acting, sounding" in ways overlooked--for example the us=
e
of forgeries of the Italian letter and non-eixstant "evidence
online"provided by Curveball, an iraqi refugee seeeking asylum in German
whom the Americans never met--al of these fkaes and hoaxes  for the invasio=
n
of Iraq
(ever wonder why Colin Powell used artist's conceptions of the trucks and
othermateril for making poision gas by the tanker load--and not fotos?)
what is the part that words and images play when there is such a breakdown
that things are compartmentalized so as not to reveal their "not adding up,
inequalities" etc--why does a Black American President support Apartheid?
why do you? or you --unquestioningly people race to the Orwellian vision!

in a time period in which memoirs and poems also are being reveled as fakes=
,
hoaxes at an almost weekly rate --why not fake the evidence for a War?
now it's Iran's turn--
with the iranian "Prince" being interviewed on US TV for his ideas about
the"Democracy Movement in Iran"
nothing like a Prince to tell you all abt that eh-
the goal of Newspeak is to prevent the mind frm being able to see
contradictions--War is Peace  Ignorance is Strength  --
or the drastic devlotution inanimal farm from "four feet good, two feet bad=
"
to "all animals are equal but some are more equal than others"--and inthe
end, on two feet, the pigs "rise to thelevel of humans"  and like them chea=

the following might be offensive to some because it uses images drawn from
the internet via a google image search of silvia saint, a 'pornstar.'

here's a new series of dbcinema screenshots as a slidvid/slideshow:
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/saint2/slideshow.htm

if you're on a pc, the F11 key should toggle the browser to fullscreen (and
back when you're done).

you can also view the screenshots individually at
http://vispo.com/dcinema/saint2

you can watch a concatenation of all the dbcinema slidvids at
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/saint2/slidvid.htm

all these images were made with dbcinema, a graphic synthesizer i'm writing.
alternatively, it might be called a langu(im)age processor.

here's a video talk i did in vancouver about dbcinema:
http://vispo.com/dbcinema/video/vantalk . here's something i wrote about
dbcinema: http://vispo.com/dbcinema/kandinsky3/intro

Dear friends of Tinfish Press:

I hope everyone is having a good summer.

Tinfish Press will be re-publishing Lee Tonouchi's important 2002 book,
LIVING PIDGIN, soon. We would like to offer it at a pre-publication
price of $10 to anyone within reach of this announcement. Send checks to

Tinfish Press
47-728 Hui Kelu Street #9
Kane`ohe, HI 96744

or use our (usually) handy 2checkout.com method on our website (hit
“purchase” and then scroll down the alphabetical list until you get to
Living Pidgin).

http://tinfishpress.com

You can see Tinfish Press's description of the first edition of the book
here:

http://www.tinfishpress.com/living_pidgin.html


I 've blogged on Lee's book here

http://tinfisheditor.blogspot.com/2009/06/contemplations-on-contemplations-on.html

I also blogged on Paul Naylor's new Tinfish volume, JAMMED TRANSMISSION

http://tinfisheditor.blogspot.com/2009/06/paul-naylors-waste-of-paper-in-jammed.html

and on Norman Fischer's CHARLOTTE'S WAY

http://tinfisheditor.blogspot.com/2009/06/on-impossibility-of-meditative-poetry.html

Please check out the rest of the blog, as well. It's proving a good
place for me to meditate on the poetics behind the poetry published by
Tinfish.

Thanks for your continuing support of small press poetry from the Pacific.

Aloha,

Susan M. Schultz

WHERE: 155 St. & BWAY
WHEN:  June 30, 7PM
WHY: PEACE, AIMLESSNESS, RELIEF, SOLDARITY, RESISTANCE, SOLACE, IRONY,
FRIVOLITY, HAD ENOUGH

Being invited by Dia to curate a performance for a summer evening vaguely i=
n
response to Zoe=92s show and the Hispanic Museum=92s collection. I have inv=
ited
five poets who invited five other poets (so there=92s 25 of us, names below=
.)
Invited as well are The Village Zendo, soprano Juliana Snapper, dancer
Christine Elmo and four cohorts and about 40 kids from PS 4 conducted by
poets Julie Patton and Christine Hou and finally a life drawing group from
Brooklyn known as  F>A>R>T>S (Friends of the Fine Arts) ; all will converge
to sit, move, read and perform SILENTLY for one hour on the Hispanic
Museum=92s incredibly spacious and evocative Audubon Plaza. You as audience
are invited to come up and stroll amongst this silent happening at your own
genial pace. You=92re urged to dress vividly & shamelessly as if you were
attending a wedding or a renaissance fair or a nature hike, an art opening,
poetry reading or to spray-paint things on your roof. At 8;15 the silence
will end and morph into a decent party.
