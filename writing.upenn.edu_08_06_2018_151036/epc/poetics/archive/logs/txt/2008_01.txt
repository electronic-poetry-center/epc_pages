I've just used the YouSendIt site to send Peter Durgin the recording of the
reading in Chicago.  If I understand correctly, the file will remain available
to anyone for download for the next 14 days at this link:

If your computer isn't plugged into decent speakers, you may want to listen through headphones to get good volume.  I haven't taken time to track this, so it's one continuous recording.

hmmmm -- When I emailed that message last night, it did not include the part
that goes "A class=content" etc. -- the only operative part was the very last
part, which was the link -- I have no idea what made the message come through
with additional characters -- I'm pasting the link in again and hoping we don't
see the same result.  At any rate, the ONLY part that actually is the link
reads: <http://download.yousendit.com/78BFA162312959F>.  I see that if you
clicked on the first appearance of that string in the garbled message, you get
a "page not found" message, whereas if you click on its last occurrence it
works just fine -- odd -- still, the file is there waiting for any who want to
download it --

I've uploaded a slideshow of photos taken at this year's MLA reading to my blog
site:

<http://heatstrings.blogspot.com/>

I think I managed to get pictures of all but two or three of the readers.  If
your browser works like most, just click on the arrow to start the slides.  If
there is a particular shot you want to download, you should be able to click on
the picture, get to the web album and download from there.

Screenshots from dbCinema movies generated by typing in "abstract art" as
the concept. dbCinema proceeds to download images from the net somehow
relating to "abstract art" and, while this is happening creates a painterly

David - with much respect for much of what you deliver to this list, I think your take on Holzer is 'off' - not 'on' - Jenny Holzer's projections of Rumsfeld's quotes. Unlike the whoever's who made and supported celebratory little operas or chamber events of R's phrasings when the R charade masqued (criminally, as such) what was really happening in Iraq -  the Holzer at MassMOCA does not strike me at all as either disingenous, or  a way to secure cash from the Art World.
 (I don't know of any artist who makes money directly off installation art as such. Spin-offs, maybe. But I don't how many folks want to live with Rumsfeld in their living room - even as a miniature, that would be still like having a monster in the house.)
 To confuse Holzer's intentions - which I think are genuinely political - with say that of Damien Hirst - takes the eye way off the value of the work.

I made xerox copies of these and put them on my wall; the first of these on the inside of my door to prevent me from leaving my apartment to buy things on impulse that I don't really need and won't even want for very long. I'm very sorry the current show isn't coming to New York City as I would love to see it. I read the review and it sounds fascinating. Regards, Tom Savage

David Chirot  wrote:  Dear Stephen:

I recently an interesting short piece by the American Indian writer
James Welch regarding the Jewish novel and "Novels of Assimilation" among
others which dominated the literary news of his youth. "The assimilation
into American life"--Welch writes--for an Indian as THE American does not
exist. "American life" is foreign life, and a foreign life in which the
Indian has never been wante and in which the Indian does not want to be. .
Portnoy had a complaint, Welch notes, and it is heard and sells in the
millions, it becomes a "great book." An Indian has no complaint, Welch
says, because a complaint, like everything else, would be taken away. Some
one else would take it away and make millions and have it be called "a great
book." So an Indian has no complaint, no assimilation. Something other,
else, has to be found, already existing, being made, moving among knowns and
unknowns, the first and existing "America".

"O, say can you see . . ."

Reading through the various articles about the "Projections" show and
looking at the images in photos. one finds an immediate and unquestioning
"belief" in the Institutionalized Aestheticization of words and images which
on their first appearance in newspapers, tv screens were greeted with much
the same unquestioning and immediate belief. The reviews of Holzer's show
echo the rave reviews for going to War with Iraq, Home of the Worst Monster
in the World and the untold horrors threatening WMD extinction of Israel,
Great Britain and the USA. While the reception is the same, there is the
literally BIG difference between the old Rumsfield documents and the new
Holzer ones in that the new ones are no longer "lies" and "mistakes" but
Great Works of Art . These will make a bundle for Ms Holzer, her galleries
and associates, and find ultimately , like the politicos involved, "good
private/corporate homes" to "pass the rest of their days in."

The giant paintings made of memos taken from cyber space images--how
different are they from the online images and documents that Curveball used
to give to the German BND who passed on this "intelligence" to the CIA,
DIA, and other American organizations and created these very memos? This
already-on-line "intelligence" was used to start the Invasion/Occupation
campaign for the Iraq war, just as the "intelligence" Holzer uses becomes a
new American installation campaign for Ms Holzer. (All the review and
articles note this is her first American installation of the "Projections"
works, as well as the use of a Real Poet's words used in place of her own
"more moralistic" ones being new)

"Won't get fooled again,"!! the reviewers and public cry who troop to
see the same documents which fooled them the first around. No, this time
the same words and images used to slaughter millions and cost trillions will
be turned to the quiet business of making "art world" money and "selling"
the public on "being able to distinguish the difference between a big
painting and a virtual version of a small document." Different media,
different objectives, same campaign: SELL the reviewers and public on the
"Installation" of these words and images as Truth. First Rumsfield & Co's
Truth, now Holzer's Truth.

The Artist, Art World and Art Market "Triumph" and profit, from this
"sleight of hand". Mean while the politicians and military attempt to
"surge" forward from the jaws of near defeat.

To make up for the former "wrong belief" of cheering the documents' Truth,
the reviewers and public may now witness and rave about the "purifying of
the language of the tribe" via a Very Highly and Institutionally Approved
Artist's "renditions" of "bad words" into an Aesthetic-Ethical Realm of the
Good. Beholding one's own now Light-Bath cleansed reflection in the Image
which has cleansed the Words,--is this not "Good?" (For the soul, the
pocketbook, the Institutions, the Artist, America?)

The art works may also be seen another way. What if the viewer is a
True Believer in the Greatness of the War and its Architects, its Document
Makers? Then do not these art works confirm the Heroic Status of those
involved--Rummie, Bush, et alia?

The manner of the presentation, which the Times reviewer likens to a
post apocalyptic, empty political or rock'rool' stadium--doesn't it echo
magnificently the Art and Architecture of Leni Riefenstahl and Albert Speer?


To further enhance the aestheticization of the political, (which
Walter Benjamin noted is the Fascist way), the spectator is bathed in
rippling waves of words made of letters of light--and not just any
words--but the "impressionistic" lyric poetry of a Nobel Prize Winner.

The "impressionistically" lyricized and lit spectator advances--or
is ensconced, agog, in the the "artfully scattered" giant bean bag chairs
often found in front of the "Home" TVs of the Homeland----into the
Spectacular Light Show glorifying the paintings. "Let there be Light"--and
the documents are now "up-lifted" in Moral Aesthetic parlance, in to the
realms of High Art, into the Aura of Great Art and the Great Artist. (For
were not Speer and Riefenstahl the Artists who transformed the works of the
"failed artist" into Great Works of Art glorifying his ascension into the
Being of Supreme Artist?)


Behold O spectator, O puny being of lyrical lightness--the great
tablets of Mammon, Deity of War and Art. Behold the dirty Rumsfield Files
metastasized, the blood lusting documents Super Steroid Sized, and the
Return of the Aura of the Original to what had once been mere copies of
copies of copies based on forgeries, faulty analysis, deliberate
mistranslations, in turn based on copies of copies of things which were
interpreted to be something else other than what they were subsequently
found and/or not found to be.

Where the "original" WMDS were not found, are found now Temples of
Art where the Resurrection of Death's Documents is accomplished, the
redemption of Lying Copies achieved and the wiping clean of guilt
accomplished in the Triumphant Celebration of the Signature of Art and
Artist over the Signature of mere Party hacks.
What was once copies, forgeries, lies, is now made Original, Truth,
Art. ("O say can you see . . . ")

And as the lyric-and light-bathed spectator lifts an adoring and
completely Believing gaze to the Aestheticized Political Documents,
near-starvation homeless farmers and imported near-slave laborers under the
dangerous watch of Contractors like Black Water are digging up the last
vestiges of the vast historical strati of Iraqi history. These rapidly
dwindling supplies of artifacts and documents in the world's oldest writing
are being shipped out and sold off to the highest or most closely associated
bidder. ("O say, can you see . . . ")

While a civilization vanishes, its destroyers celebrate its
destruction with the Spectacular
Exhibition of their discredited war plans raised to the status of Art. ("O,
say can you see . . . ")

High Art, Art of Great Value and Importance, Art of the Land of the Free
and the Home of the Brave.
One feels a Patriotic swelling in the breast, the genesis of the
Patriotic Act and the Patriot Act. The right hand goes almost automatically
to its place above the heart and--standing at attention--one joins in the
Mighty Choir of "Projections" and Lights:

Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof thro' the night that our flag was still there.
O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

Dirty Swan Projects announces the release of The Cheer-Up Book of
Wounded Soldiers, a book of wartime conversations from the mouths of
World War I deserters:


Don't be unprepared for tomorrow's newspaper! After dissolving all
borders by our cowardice, we deserters harnessed a hopeless cheer, a
laughter of artillery-sized trembling. Want to learn a thing or two?
No visit to our caves is required! Spend the day with our CHEER-UP
BOOK ($8 USD). Read the newest pick-me-ups, speculations, and ephemera
=96 fresh from No Man's Land.

All returns from these CHEER-UP BOOKS will go to St. Dunstan's, a
school established in 1915 to rehabilitate blinded soldiers. The
purchase of two CHEER-UP BOOKS can equip a St. Dunstan's lad with a
talking watch! War goes on, but so should good cheer!

i remember that when schindler's list came out, the ending struck me as
goofy odd and the whole thing seemed somehow odd to me. a friend remarked
that it was a story of big money doing good. like spielberg with his movie.

i think it's hard to create art that does not negate what it would affirm
and affirm what it would negate in art of spectacle. in non-spectacle work
also, but perhaps especially in spectacle. big budget art. we know that in
any media, the artist has to grapple with the active principles of the
media/um or they will hijack the work, being active.

how much more challenging to deal in an art of political spectacle, as
holzer has done here? the whole thing is ready to cave into any number of
darknesses, pits, hypocrasies, fearfulnesses, compromises.

very interesting exchange, david and vincent. thank you.

elegy for Boojum, our companion cat, we are all poor,


'i can't do elegy' -
this is a poor and sleepless poem -
when something's at the limit there's nothing more to say -
for a moment i might have reversed the process
but heard nothing more than wailing or sounds like an animal -
nothing of crying, just tattered sound -
nothing of warning, fear, existence, trepidation -
nothing can be said on either side of death -
neither this one nor that one -
neither this nor the other -
death is an other -
(eighteen years, and death is an other) -
death is everywhere, death is not around -
(eighteen years, and death is everywhere,
death is poor, death is not around) -
always already other can't speak can't hear can't see -
double needles, of sedative, of anesthetic overdose -
doubled needles -
who are these people & their kindness -
(eighteen years and the kindness of strangers) -
i'm done with it, the other's never done with it -
always the last trip last day last night
last meal last touch last scent last sound -
(eighteen years and the last day and night,
last touch and meal, last scent and sound) -
in and out of the thick of it -
the thick of it never changed -
it stayed dry, viscous, substance and fissure -
it's uncomfortable, stains, sticks to everything -
lives on in us, exchanged, drops to the ground -
crawls out, walks to the sea, drops to the ground -
i can't drop to the ground, i drop to the ground -
there's an elegy on, everyone's there -
she says i think we're at the beginning of speech -
she says she's very sad and wants to go hone -
she stood dry, unattended -
(eighteen years and dry and unattended,
accompanied and unaccompanied, who can go
into and out of the world) -
the fire went out, into the world --
today someone counted elements,
earth, fire, water, wind, air, heat, dearth,
wood, & metal -
(eighteen years and the counting of elements) -
how was the air, the air was cold, bitter,
the wind harsh, we turned the carrier against
the wind, dearth of it all, harboring a flame
until the last, dying in our arms, the metal table,
off to a far wood of hunting -
the world is filled with secret coordinates -
impermanence of the metallic -
she says she thought of the limit -
in a small heaven somewhere -
& now we are silent in the night, existence is silent -
existence crawls, we heard her cries, the catheter
carefully inserted elsewhere in the building -
we held her heat against us, we exchanged heat -
the tablets - prayer wheel spinning above a slow flame -
we couldn't bear to empty her water, clean
her bowl of food, now despair reigns, & in our arms
nothing happened, everything seized --
'this is a poor and sleepless poem' -
without goodbyes, with ill-knowledge,
with infinite regret, with the world undone -
(eighteen years and the world undone) -
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah
ah ah ah ah

First Annual =E2=80=9CSnowman Slam=E2=80=9D Brings New Voices to Buffalo
Buffalo, NY, December 18, 2007:
On Friday, January 4, 2008, Buffalo will experience a literary first =E2=
=80=93 four poetry slam teams from around the regional will face off in the=
 first annual =E2=80=9CSnowman Slam=E2=80=9D to try and qualify for partici=
pation at the National Poetry Slam in Madison, WI in August of 2008.
=C2=A0
=E2=80=9CPoetry slam has grown so much around the country, that there are c=
urrently 110 venues registered with Poetry Slam, Inc., and only 75 slots at=
 the annual competition. The Slam Family created this Regionals system to h=
elp deal with the increase in participation,=E2=80=9D said Nickel City Slam=
 Founder, Gabrielle Bouliane. =E2=80=9CBuffalo is one of the newest certifi=
ed venues in the nation, so it=E2=80=99s a big deal to be able to host this=
 event.=E2=80=9D
=C2=A0
Poets from Dayton, Cleveland, and Toronto will pack their bags and bring th=
eir best to Shea=E2=80=99s historic Smith Theater, giving Buffalo its first=
 taste of a larger team-style competition. Teams will participate in four r=
ounds, with each team getting one slot per round. Teams can compete with on=
e poet or a group in their slot, hoping to get the highest score per round =
and get the highest total score at the end of the night. The top two scorin=
g teams will be guaranteed slots at the National Poetry Slam, with third an=
d fourth place going on a waiting list. Scoring is done by five judges rand=
omly chosen from the audience, on a scale of one through ten, Olympics styl=
e, with the high and low score being dropped. =E2=80=9CThis is what has mad=
e the poetry slam so controversial in the academic world, and yet so compel=
ling =E2=80=93 it was meant to involve a =E2=80=9Cregular guy=E2=80=9D audi=
ence in poetry, which had become something completely removed from everyday=
 life. Poets have to connect with their audience immediately, be entertaini=
ng and enlightening to get the elusive perfect 30,=E2=80=9D Gabrielle conti=
nued. =E2=80=9CObviously it=E2=80=99s working, or we wouldn=E2=80=99t need =
Regionals.=E2=80=9D
=C2=A0
Getting the event off to a hot start are two performers sure to set the bar=
 high =E2=80=93 two-time national individual champion and Def Poet Mike McG=
ee (San Jose), and national individual finalist Robbie Q. Telfer (Chicago).=
 =E2=80=9CBoth Mike and Robbie are not what you think of when you hear the =
word =E2=80=98poetry=E2=80=99,=E2=80=9D says Bouliane. =E2=80=9CThey talk a=
bout everything from pudding to MuppetsTM, will have you rolling in the ais=
les, then spin their words into something that changes how you see everyday=
 life. They=E2=80=99re awesome.=E2=80=9D
=C2=A0
While the competition is important, especially to Buffalo poets hoping to m=
ake =E2=80=9Cthe Big Show=E2=80=9D, just as important are the friendships a=
nd contacts made during the event. Says Bouliane. =E2=80=9CIn my 11 years w=
ith the poetry slam, I=E2=80=99ve travelled to 29 cities and made hundreds =
of friends. I hope that for these poets, this show is just the beginning.=
=E2=80=9D
=C2=A0
The fun begins at 7pm on Friday, January 4, 2008, at Shea=E2=80=99s Smith T=
heater, 660 Main Street. Tickets are =2410 and are available at the door. F=

Dear Stephen and Friends--

Priez que le Bon Dieu m'absoudre--pray the Good Lord forgives me--for havin=
g
mentioned filthy lucre in the same breath with the Purity and Sanctity of
the "intentions" and "political" aspects of the mass event sized , marshale=
d
and lit "Projections".  "Perish the thought." (Just kidding--)

In psychological terms, as a friend suggested to think on, a "Projection" i=
s
a defense mechanism by means of which a person projects on to another their
own most unacceptable and feared inner desires.  In which case, perhaps the
artist is Projecting on to Rumsfeld what she most despises and fears in
herself?

Or--on to the spectators?

Or- are the spectators passively gazing in rapt Belief at the icons of
Holzer duplicating those of Rumsfeld =96 lifting up shining eyes reflecting
back the Projection into its own eyes- and seeing there the reflection of
Rummie's memos reflected in "Holzer's eyes----so that it then becomes a
"triangle" in which Rummie, Holzer and spectator are all involved.  A
"m=E9nage a trois"  or a "Nuclear Family" tripping the Light Fantastic?

Are the spectators reflecting Projections which simultaneously carry the
conflicted emotions of "for" and "against"  the others and themselves?  A
Projection-Spectacle in which abasement and elevation are at once murky and
calling out for a "black and white" division between "good" and "evil"? A
separation of "us" from "them"? Holzer reflecting via Projections the same
sense of "opposition" as Rummie & Co demand?  The "Opposition" between "us"
and them"=97an opposition of passive spectatorships occurring only "in the =
eye
of the beholder"?=97



One thinks of Lacan's ideas re Poe's "Purloined Letter," in which the Lette=
r
is moving through the doubled scenes of purloining, is  folded in on
itself,  reversed and hididen in plain sight  for the with/holding of its
Power.  The "action" of the "plot" being to re-purloin, unfold, reverse bac=
k
its original state and return the Letter to its correct "address"--that of
its destination, the "rightful" Power.

  (One also recalls that for Poe/Dupin/Lacan--what brings the Letter "to
light"--is the Detective's reflection on it in the dark which brings to
light the reversed and hidden-in-plain-sight  nature of its location hidden
in plain sight, in the light of day.   This making use of the darkness to
see what is hidden in the light is  the reverse of "Projectons'" massive
display of Light--which is what leads one to think not that something is
"revealed," but that something is hidden in all these pyrotechnics--which
is  that spectators cannot see their own powerlessness, can only see and
Believe in the Power of Authority, of Control, of conformity.

 Projections and reflections, a doubling of the same memos, a doubling of
their "interpretations," a doubling of their receptions, a doubling of
Authority Figures--=97in al of this doubling is there not the opportunity f=
or
the "double cross"?  For a "Smoke and Mirrors" Light Show not unlike the ol=
d
Shell game, in which it is proven once again that the hand is quicker than
the eye?



And what is returned to the correct address is always the same:  Power.

"The names may change, but the game remains the same." Or, as the Italians
say, "to change everything so that nothing is changed."



It's disturbing to me that the reception of the work is a repeat of the
reception on the whole of the reasons, the memos, for the War in Iraq and
the War on Terror.

At first Rummie's words and those of the administration--the speech by Powe=
l
to the UN, Bush's famous "16 words" which were based on the known-to-be
forged "Italian Letter," mixed in with the faked intelligence of
"Curveball,"-were embraced as "Truth"=97


And now, five years later, known to be "lies" and "mistakes" they are
embraced in Holzer's "Projections" as "Truth" all over again, simply becaus=
e
while the words remain the same, the Belief in them shifts from a Belief in
Rummie's use of them to a Belief in Holzer's use of them

What remains the same is the Belief in Power, Authority and the "Truth" of
the one who is currently in possesion of the "Letters/memos"

This is like Poe's Purloined Letter=97changing the addresses   where Power
resides=97from the Pentagon to the Museum--while not changing Power itself =
one
whit=97so that it arrives at its destination--


 Rummie's writings have come full circle and repeated themselves in being
found first as "found art" and now found again as words "writ
large"--installed inside another institutional environment of Power, the
Museum--

Rummie's words, repudiated as "Truth," become "Truth" yet again, only now
one that "belongs" to Holzer and the Museum, to the High Art World, to the
High "value" which Stephen ascribes to them=97



The memos are returned to the correct address=97an Institution of Power and
Authority,  and given the full opprobrium of the media--
which had the first time around given the same treatment to the memos when
they "belonged" to Rumsfeld--

from the Pentagon and White House to the Museum--

from the tv screen and newspaper image in the privacy of the home--seeing
the memos there-first---and now seeing them  writ large=97( so we don't "mi=
ss
the message"?) in the privatized paying customer "public" Spectacularly Lit
sphere of the Museum--

 It is not only Power which remains the same,  it's also the unquestioning
Belief in it-and in the Figure of Authority which is representing it in an
Officially Sanctioned Institution of High Art, High "Values"-- "replaying"
Shock and Awe's bombardments and flows of Light=97to ensure that the pacifi=
ed
spectator "gets the message"--

after thirty years of exposure to a brand name designated "Holzer" many hav=
e
come to Believe that its "words" are Truth--
one "invests" them with a Power due to their being presented, represented b=
y
the signature brand name "Holzer," which is equated with  being  the
"opposite" of,  or "oppositional" to, the "reverse" of the  Power of anothe=
r
brand name and its "values"-


that this is "True" is shown by the mass scale of the "Projections" and
where they are installed--in an Institutional setting which the reviewer
likens to sites for rock concerts or political rallies--and are not unlike
the Light Shows and massive set-up's, the "Projections" that Speer
constructed for Hitler--

the setting, the lighting, the rapt Belief that one is in the Presence of a
Figure of Authority and Bearer of Truth. supported and buttressed by the
Authority of the Museum and the Institutions of High Art--all of these
ramify, magnify, glorify Belief in Power, in Authority, in the Rummie/Jenny
Artist, in the Institution=97in the Projection Before Our Very Eyes=97of th=
e
spectacle that is "in denial" in these-Projections=97that is, the spectacle=
 of
one's conformity, one's obeisance, one's adoration and assent=97one's
abasement=97before Power=97itself--

from the point of view of Power--what could be more desirable than this
situation--
that the "opposition" is a mass of spectators prostrate before the "Truth"
of their "Belief" in Authority--

to Power, this Belief in Authority is the "sign" of the passivity of the
"opposition" every bit as much as it is the sign  of the Believer in
Rummie--

when "oppositional" views are hanging in Museums for all to see and give
unquestioning Belief to, with the idea that by doing so the spectators  are
participating in 'resistance"--

this is the ultimate triumph for Power--
that the opposition is safely ensconced in rapt Belief and contemplation in
a Museum--

NOT outside in the streets demonstrating or trashing government offices, NO=
T
actively engaged in "change on the ground" but simply content with the
"change" of the mis-en-scene of the contemplation of Power=97of Authority--

the "assent" to the Power in the Museum is no different from this viewpoint
than the "assent of the governed"--

while the Constitution is being shredded, and every day it seems more right=
s
taken away, trembling on the verge of disappearance, when the checks and
balances on an Imperial Presidency aka Dictatorship are being hacked away s=
o
that barely a few threads remain to be severed for an "elected" president t=
o
declare themselves the Dear Leader-



-while al this serious business is going on--the spectator is finding
"freedom" and "dissent" in the contemplation of Belief in a "Truth" hanging
inside a Museum and lit for all the world like a mock up model for a truly
Great Spectacle--of the enshrinement of Total Power=97

Perhaps even a "trial run"--

(Hitler accomplished this, even pointing out that now that the laws had
given him the means to attain total power, he could of course do away with
the laws--since he now had the power to do so with their very own legal
consent)

 The  "being moved" and Believing one is "seeing  the Truth" that the
spectator experiences before the Museum display is what one is supposed to
feel at the exhibition of Power--that one is "moved," that one finds one's
Beliefs confirmed--and raised to a High Art, to a Truth=97a "real value" "w=
e
all share"=97


It is an emotion almost the same as an unquestioning Patriotism that the
spectator is supposed to feel in the Museum--that indeed one reads in the
words of the reviewers=97

(this is why I quoted from the "Star Spangled Banner" previously--)

and just as one runs afoul of Power in being critical of the president or o=
f
several other agencies of Power, it apparently is almost sacrilegious to
question the Purity and "value" of Holzer's "intentions"--to not be "for"
the Museum installation is to be "against them"--and so an "enemy combatant=
"
as it were--because one refuses to be a blind Believer in Power=97


to think that one is "resisting" and "oppositional" by "agreeing" with and
Believing in what bears the label of "opposition" and "appears to be"
manifesting the signs of this--not the action of it, but the signs of it as
read within the "Friendly Confines" of the Museum, of the Stadium=97of
Homeland Security=97


"rooting for the home team" as it were-- means rooting for "our" "freedom"
--to be spectators=97at the spectacle of the unfreedom of "our" own
conformity=97"our own" passivity=97"our own" unquestioning Belief in Author=
ity
and Security--

Power itself could not be more happy--to see that those thinking of
themselves as being "resistant" to it--are simply passive spectators, payin=
g
customers, i.e. consumers--lining up to have a rapt time of unbridled Belie=
f
before the Icons and Figures of Authority within the safe confines and
powerful embrace of state and corporate funded Institutions--

Power, seeing how easily "the people' can be led around by the nose--one
moment unquestioningly Believing in the War and the Government's "Truth" an=
d
the next in the "Truth" of the same documents simply displayed differently
at a different point of time, when Rummie is safely out of office and gone
to join Marjorie Perloff at Stanford-



Power, Seeing this, -then Power knows there is nothing to fear at all--from
within--as long as Fear is kept up by those Evils without=97i.e.  it's now
Iran's turn to be the Great Fear---the "new Hitler"=97



(remember when the "new Nixon" was elected?=97"Nixon Mach IV" as Hunter S.
Thompson dubbed that particular model)



--Iran--which Bush is attending meetings about in Israel next week=97(last
week Israeli intelligence visited Washington)-Israel  has openly announced
it intends to attack Iran no matter what the latest American intelligence
reports say--because, having been wrong before, why should they be right
now?=97


which means in reverse that they "were right the first time"--



much in the way the Rummie memos, being "right" then "wrong"  become "right=
"
again when hung in the Museum--when right/wrong have been shown to have bee=
n
based on false premises--why should right/wrong the next time around be
Believed in as "True"=97yet their very "falsity" the first time around=97be=
comes
turned into "Truth" the second time around=97in the Museum=97in an attack o=
n
Iran--

Power, seeing the workings of this running so smoothly, will feel no
compunction in launching another War--having seen that "resistance" and
"opposition" are safely ensconced in Museums=97


in Museums, mind you--like "Old Masters"--and "Mummies"--the infantilized a=
s
a friend wrote--spectator there before the First Authorities--Daddy and
Mommy--
is not this the complete triumph of Power, of Authority and is it not
fitting that the Museum installation be so reminiscent of those constructed
for the Daddy of the Third Reich/--managed and documented by Leni
Reifenstahl--lit by Speer=97as the plans are laid for the attack on "the ne=
w
Hitler"?--

one imagines if there were anyone in Power with any kind of sense of
humor--they would be laughing themselves silly at the realization of how
pacified and passive the population has become, when it thinks it is "free"
and "resisting" and "voicing opposition" in the contemplation of works on a
massive scale within the walls of the Museum, the ultimate receptacle of th=
e
Past--the symbol of Historical Archives , of "purifying of the language of
the tribe" =96of the Mummies and  Old Masters of "our" Culture--



Purifying and Canonizing, Sanctifying , so that "lies" and mistakes" become
washed clean in the Baptismal  Baths of Light and become "Projections" of
the feared and despised hidden "Truth"=97that the spectators have become
"helpless children" in the Presence of Authority=97obedient, conformist,
"enthralled" by the spectacle of their own "being good children" and
Believing in the "Truth" and "Authority" of  the Institutionalized Power of
Rummie and Mummie=97manifested in their sharing the same memos=97

      . . . ."politics makes strange bedfellows" after all--

love it. it occurs to me, in reading your post, david, that it rarely goes
well for many poets because they find themselves with such very unpopular
thoughts.

poetry as the art of unpopular thoughts.

or, half relatedly, as gerry gilbert said,

"Poetry, the trick to read what can't be read,
quick to write what can't be said."

isn't it possible, though, david, that rather than operating as you have
detailed (or perhaps not 'rather than' but something else), holzer's piece
seeks to expose the lies and perfidy of the administration, to hold
inexcusable actions up to the light? so that they be held accountable.

i know the art world would settle for much less with its art, but might it
be what holzer is trying to bring about with art?

David, I think the real essence of your critique comes when you say that Po=
wer triumphs when the Opposition is inside the museum and not in the street=
s--which is true, or would be if one could so easily reify Power and Opposi=
tion, as if there were not many powers and many oppositions and as if they =
could not change places--but when there is no opposition in the streets, wo=
uld you rather there be no opposition at all instead of opposition in the m=
useum? And if you are not yourself "trashing government offices" so that ot=
hers could at least begin to gauge the utility of this gesture, do you real=
ly have any ground to criticize others for not doing so?=0A=0A=0A----- Orig=

No Man=92s Land: The Love Poem at the Start of the 21st Century

=93Though, for the most part, nineteenth- and twentieth century women =
writers
have been far less confident of women=92s victory than their male =
counterparts
were, they nevertheless document the casualties of a battle of the =
sexes, a
battle over the zone that many men experienced as a no man=92s land =
because it
debilitated masculinity but that a number of women defined, if only
fleetingly, as a no man=92s land because it seemed to herald=85a =
=93Herland=94.
Gilbert Susan M. and Gubar, Susan, No Man=92s Land, Volume 1: The War of =
the
Words, p. 66

The love poem has a long history both in English and in other languages =
=96
and, for most of that history, it was the male of the species that was
writing it. Long before Shakespeare and the Sonnet - a form borrowed =
from
the Italian - Dante, Petrarch, and a host of others, influenced by the
troubadours and trouv=E8res, were creating amour courtois, defined by =
the
University of Reading=92s Department of French Studies in the internet
syllabus to their course Medieval Love Literature as:

Courtly love (amour courtois or in Proven=E7al fin=92amors) is thought =
to have
developed in the twelfth century in France. Its origins are obscure but =
it
seems to have been influenced both by the Latin love poetry of the =
clerical
schools of the period and by the Arab love songs and poetry which were
popular in the courts of Spain where bilingual minstrels flourished. =
Their
work was also known in the courts of southern France where Proven=E7al =
was
used and where the troubadours flourished throughout the twelfth =
century.
Guillaume IX de Poitou was the first troubadour whose poetry survives. =
From
the troubadours came the concepts of mesure (mezura), prouesse =
(proezia),
courtoisie (cortezia) and jeunesse (joven) which lead to joie (joia). =
These
qualities lead to a spiritual enrichment of the lovers which has an
uplifting effect on the society around them. The lovers are usually not
married to each other, and in the south fin=92amors was between a =
married
woman and an unmarried, often younger, man who might well be slightly
inferior in rank to her although still noble. Fin=92amors was often =
platonic
in the sense that it was unconsummated although the emotions expressed =
by
the troubadours were burningly passionate and carnal. Troubadour poetry =
has
been described as the =91poetry of frustration=92 as the poet derived =
his
inspiration from the unsatisfied longing which he felt for the beloved.

Two things should be noted from the above: (1) the concept of the cougar =
is
not a new innovation although it has probably been carried to further
extremes in the 20th C, and (2) this period and studies of the =
Proven=E7al
were major influences on Ezra Pound. On a more serious and more =
important
note, this was the period of the pedestal =96 something which has =
haunted
women since and which has created the image of a separate, superior =
species,
- woman as =91other=92 as Simone de Beauvoir would say several centuries =
later -
thus hampering attempts to gain equality.
This is the background then for the love poem entering the trough of =
English
literature. Prior to Shakespeare and his Sonnets, we had Sir Gawain and =
the
Green Knight, Beowulf, Chaucer, etc =96 some of which may have been =
bawdy but
none of which could properly be called love poetry. These cats were more
interested in fighting than fucking =96 more into the exploits of a =
brave
knight fighting against a formidable beast than into even braver nights
fighting an even more formidable one but, at the same time, much more
pleasurable and rewarding. Then Willy came along and the whole thing
shifted. Inheriting the Italian legacy, he wrote sonnet after sonnet on =
love
=96 which was pretty amazing considering the number of plays he was able =
to
write while diddling =96 which he must have been quite prolific at =
considering
where his imagination lay most of the time.
Following Willie (have you ever considered why he=92s called that?), =
there was
somewhat of a lull during which Edmund Spenser and his eunuch cronies
perfected the iambic pentameter. Oh, sure, they had their moments but, =
on
the whole, they would have given their left nut for Viagra. Then came =
John
Donne and Andrew Marvell and the other metaphysical poets. John was a
contemporary of Edmund but he knew how to do the horizontal mambo to =
great
effect. He could talk about compasses and make you horny.
Then there was silence =96 at least in poetry. Certainly, the 18th C saw =
Henry
Fielding, writer of Tom Jones, and Daniel Defoe, who wrote Moll =
Flanders,
but he and his contemporaries wrote in prose, not poetry. These texts =
were
also about fucking and getting fucked rather than about love - which is =
a
completely different playground. The English poets seemingly forgot not =
what
it meant but how it felt to procreate. Oh, sure, D. H. Lawrence diddled =
a
little bit, having written Lady Chatterley=92s Lover, but he thought it =
was
dirty and was himself a misogynist. So it was left to a 20th Chilean =
poet,
Pablo Neruda, to teach those male poets of English ancestry (and here I =
mean
poets writing in English speaking countries) where their cajones were.
You will note that I have been distinguishing male from female poets. =
This
is because there have been many fine female poets who have inherited the
cajones of their male counterparts and have had no difficulty getting it =
up
and writing extremely sensuous, erotic love poetry. Elizabeth Olds, for =
one,
comes to mind although Sylvia Plath was no slouch. Nor was Denise =
Levertov,
etc.
But all of that is mere preamble. The question is: Is a male poet in a
post-feminist, politically correct mine field - one who has become
completely confused as a result of the events of the last fifty odd =
years or
so when the second and third waves of feminism, or is it womanism?, hit =
-
one who, due to the virulent strains of radical feminism, and the =
competing
strains of feminist thought (Are women different (Irigaray) or not =
(Judith
Butler?)) doesn=92t know whether to shit or get off the pot and is =
afraid to
enter the bedroom because he is expected (What a fucking concept!) to, =
god
forbid, satisfy her - still permitted to write love poetry? And, if so, =
how
is this shell-shocked, PTSDed victim/survivor/hero (pick one) of the =
sexual
wars supposed to go about this - what are the restraints, the =
prohibitions,
the protocols? Does size matter?

Boojum


Our cat, Boojum, had to be put to sleep today, in our arms, two days after
her 18th birthday. We were closer to her than most people. She meditated.
She taught patience. We're distraught; she was a good friend, a companion
who helped us through bleak times. She loved olives, asparagus, tomato
sauce. She was beginning to close down; her last purring was about ten
days ago. Losing a companion (Haraway's companion species) is as bad a
loss as any other (in spite of my father, who said, It's not like losing a
person you know). I can't do elegy after days of crying, running to emer-
gency rooms, trying different foods and medication. Below is her Internet

Boojum Carter (medical report four years ago)


feline, aged 13 1/2, four years after our mother's death, biopsy diagnosed
as follows:

Microscopic: MAMMARY MASS ONE - This mass is demarcated and has a well
localized appearance. It is comprised of a collection of neoplastic
epithelial cells that are forming tubules. The tubules are separated by
variably thick connective tissue septa. The neoplastic cells have ovoid
stippled nuclei and a scant amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate is low and ranges from 0-1 per
high-power field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins. There are
scattered aggregates of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the
growth MAMMARY MASS TWO - This is the larger of the growths evaluated.
There are several large cysts. There is a proliferating population of
neoplastic epithelial cells. The cells are organized in the lobules that
are forming occasional tubules. The central areas of the lobules are
degenerate. Neoplastic cells exhibit invasion. One or two layers of cells
line the tubules. The cells have large round vesicular nuclei with
multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, scant and cytoplasmic
borders are distinct. The mitotic rate ranges up to six per high-power
field. Nonneoplastic tissue is forming margins.

DIAGNOSIS: MAMMARY MASS ONE- MAMMARY GLAD ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR, LOW
GRADE MAMMARY MASS TWO - MAMMARY GLAND ADENOCARCINOMA, TUBULAR CYSTIC

PROGNOSIS: Guarded

COMMENTS: Feline mammary malignancies should be considered capable of
metastasis and warrant a guarded prognosis at best. The first smaller
growth evaluated is well localized and is not exhibiting invasion. This
appears to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The second growth is
exhibiting invasion and this growth should be considered as having
potential for metastasis. Lymphatic invasion is not identified with any of
the sections evaluated. These growths appear to be excised.

Comments by doctor: Guarded. Felines tend not to recover. She might live
six months, several years, or less. There is no way to tell. She needs
immune system fortification. The doctor wishes her news would have been
better. The question is whether or not the tubules remain within the body.
The cancer could spread rapidly or even go into remission.

Comments by writer: Boojum is named after the Boojum tree in Baja
California. She is thirteen and a half. She exhibits no signs of illness.
She has been my companion and is highly sociable and nervous, She has the
personality, if not the skills, of a brilliant writer. At the moment she
is sleeping, recovering from the removal of her stitches. She travelled
with us to Miami, where she encountered, even indoors, new and interesting
forms of flora and fauna. Azure and I pray that she will live forever.

Comments: That cancer is always the same, disordered, disorderly, a tough
go whose treatment is violent and invasive as well. The well-defined
structure of the body begins to collapse as tunnels are formed through
highly-organized tissue.

Every organism is a world of miracles, and every creature dissolves in the
fury of cancer and creation. Azure and I are beside ourselves, and Boojum
Carter dreams now, not of death.

David, I love the Poe Purloined Letter Lacan 'projection' on to my monitor screen as per support of your argument.
 I think a fundamental flaw here is to assume the Museum goer as some hapless subject or, 'at best' performing an act of genunflection before the sanctified icons of the Museum quo Temple or Church.   I don't think it's that passive - or why not see it as a dialog between object and viewer.  Holzer's claim on righteousness of a sort has certainly pissed me off in the past. But certainly being pissed-off and/or critical ought to be part of the provocative context of the Museum (or poetry journal or poetry list or whatever).   Yes, sabotage the audio guides, the authoritarian docents and other culture feeders and put 'the self' - all you bring into the Museum and make it part of the show!

And if you are not yourself "trashing government offices" so that others could at least begin to gauge the utility of this gesture, do you really have any ground to criticize others for not doing so?

Dear Stephen and Friends--

Priez que le Bon Dieu m'absoudre--pray the Good Lord forgives me--for having
mentioned filthy lucre in the same breath with the Purity and Sanctity of
the "intentions" and "political" aspects of the mass event sized , marshaled
and lit "Projections".  "Perish the thought." (Just kidding--)

In psychological terms, as a friend suggested to think on, a "Projection" is
a defense mechanism by means of which a person projects on to another their
own most unacceptable and feared inner desires.  In which case, perhaps the
artist is Projecting on to Rumsfeld what she most despises and fears in
herself?

Or--on to the spectators?

Or- are the spectators passively gazing in rapt Belief at the icons of
Holzer duplicating those of Rumsfeld â€“ lifting up shining eyes reflecting
back the Projection into its own eyes- and seeing there the reflection of
Rummie's memos reflected in "Holzer's eyes----so that it then becomes a
"triangle" in which Rummie, Holzer and spectator are all involved.  A
"mÃ©nage a trois"  or a "Nuclear Family" tripping the Light Fantastic?

Are the spectators reflecting Projections which simultaneously carry the
conflicted emotions of "for" and "against"  the others and themselves?   A
Projection-Spectacle in which abasement and elevation are at once murky and
calling out for a "black and white" division between "good" and "evil"? A
separation of "us" from "them"? Holzer reflecting via Projections the same
sense of "opposition" as Rummie & Co demand?  The "Opposition" between "us"
and them"â€”an opposition of passive spectatorships occurring only "in the eye
of the beholder"?â€”



One thinks of Lacan's ideas re Poe's "Purloined Letter," in which the Letter
is moving through the doubled scenes of purloining, is  folded in on
itself,  reversed and hididen in plain sight  for the with/holding of its
Power.  The "action" of the "plot" being to re-purloin, unfold, reverse back
its original state and return the Letter to its correct "address"--that of
its destination, the "rightful" Power.

  (One also recalls that for Poe/Dupin/Lacan--what brings the Letter "to
light"--is the Detective's reflection on it in the dark which brings to
light the reversed and hidden-in-plain-sight  nature of its location hidden
in plain sight, in the light of day.  This making use of the darkness to
see what is hidden in the light is  the reverse of "Projectons'" massive
display of Light--which is what leads one to think not that something is
"revealed," but that something is hidden in all these pyrotechnics--which
is  that spectators cannot see their own powerlessness, can only see and
Believe in the Power of Authority, of Control, of conformity.

Projections and reflections, a doubling of the same memos, a doubling of
their "interpretations," a doubling of their receptions, a doubling of
Authority Figures--â€”in al of this doubling is there not the opportunity for
the "double cross"?  For a "Smoke and Mirrors" Light Show not unlike the old
Shell game, in which it is proven once again that the hand is quicker than
the eye?



And what is returned to the correct address is always the same:  Power.

"The names may change, but the game remains the same." Or, as the Italians
say, "to change everything so that nothing is changed."



It's disturbing to me that the reception of the work is a repeat of the
reception on the whole of the reasons, the memos, for the War in Iraq and
the War on Terror.

At first Rummie's words and those of the administration--the speech by Powel
to the UN, Bush's famous "16 words" which were based on the known-to-be
forged "Italian Letter," mixed in with the faked intelligence of
"Curveball,"-were embraced as "Truth"â€”


And now, five years later, known to be "lies" and "mistakes" they are
embraced in Holzer's "Projections" as "Truth" all over again, simply because
while the words remain the same, the Belief in them shifts from a Belief in
Rummie's use of them to a Belief in Holzer's use of them

What remains the same is the Belief in Power, Authority and the "Truth" of
the one who is currently in possesion of the "Letters/memos"

This is like Poe's Purloined Letterâ€”changing the addresses  where Power
residesâ€”from the Pentagon to the Museum--while not changing Power itself one
whitâ€”so that it arrives at its destination--


Rummie's writings have come full circle and repeated themselves in being
found first as "found art" and now found again as words "writ
large"--installed inside another institutional environment of Power, the
Museum--

Rummie's words, repudiated as "Truth," become "Truth" yet again, only now
one that "belongs" to Holzer and the Museum, to the High Art World, to the
High "value" which Stephen ascribes to themâ€”



The memos are returned to the correct addressâ€”an Institution of Power and
Authority,  and given the full opprobrium of the media--
which had the first time around given the same treatment to the memos when
they "belonged" to Rumsfeld--

from the Pentagon and White House to the Museum--

from the tv screen and newspaper image in the privacy of the home--seeing
the memos there-first---and now seeing them  writ largeâ€”( so we don't "miss
the message"?) in the privatized paying customer "public" Spectacularly Lit
sphere of the Museum--

It is not only Power which remains the same,  it's also the unquestioning
Belief in it-and in the Figure of Authority which is representing it in an
Officially Sanctioned Institution of High Art, High "Values"-- "replaying"
Shock and Awe's bombardments and flows of Lightâ€”to ensure that the pacified
spectator "gets the message"--

after thirty years of exposure to a brand name designated "Holzer" many have
come to Believe that its "words" are Truth--
one "invests" them with a Power due to their being presented, represented by
the signature brand name "Holzer," which is equated with  being  the
"opposite" of,  or "oppositional" to, the "reverse" of the  Power of another
brand name and its "values"-


that this is "True" is shown by the mass scale of the "Projections" and
where they are installed--in an Institutional setting which the reviewer
likens to sites for rock concerts or political rallies--and are not unlike
the Light Shows and massive set-up's, the "Projections" that Speer
constructed for Hitler--

the setting, the lighting, the rapt Belief that one is in the Presence of a
Figure of Authority and Bearer of Truth. supported and buttressed by the
Authority of the Museum and the Institutions of High Art--all of these
ramify, magnify, glorify Belief in Power, in Authority, in the Rummie/Jenny
Artist, in the Institutionâ€”in the Projection Before Our Very Eyesâ€”of the
spectacle that is "in denial" in these-Projectionsâ€”that is, the spectacle of
one's conformity, one's obeisance, one's adoration and assentâ€”one's
abasementâ€”before Powerâ€”itself--

from the point of view of Power--what could be more desirable than this
situation--
that the "opposition" is a mass of spectators prostrate before the "Truth"
of their "Belief" in Authority--

to Power, this Belief in Authority is the "sign" of the passivity of the
"opposition" every bit as much as it is the sign  of the Believer in
Rummie--

when "oppositional" views are hanging in Museums for all to see and give
unquestioning Belief to, with the idea that by doing so the spectators   are
participating in 'resistance"--

this is the ultimate triumph for Power--
that the opposition is safely ensconced in rapt Belief and contemplation in
a Museum--

NOT outside in the streets demonstrating or trashing government offices, NOT
actively engaged in "change on the ground" but simply content with the
"change" of the mis-en-scene of the contemplation of Powerâ€”of Authority--

the "assent" to the Power in the Museum is no different from this viewpoint
than the "assent of the governed"--

while the Constitution is being shredded, and every day it seems more rights
taken away, trembling on the verge of disappearance, when the checks and
balances on an Imperial Presidency aka Dictatorship are being hacked away so
that barely a few threads remain to be severed for an "elected" president to
declare themselves the Dear Leader-



-while al this serious business is going on--the spectator is finding
"freedom" and "dissent" in the contemplation of Belief in a "Truth" hanging
inside a Museum and lit for all the world like a mock up model for a truly
Great Spectacle--of the enshrinement of Total Powerâ€”

Perhaps even a "trial run"--

(Hitler accomplished this, even pointing out that now that the laws had
given him the means to attain total power, he could of course do away with
the laws--since he now had the power to do so with their very own legal
consent)

The  "being moved" and Believing one is "seeing  the Truth" that the
spectator experiences before the Museum display is what one is supposed to
feel at the exhibition of Power--that one is "moved," that one finds one's
Beliefs confirmed--and raised to a High Art, to a Truthâ€”a "real value" "we
all share"â€”


It is an emotion almost the same as an unquestioning Patriotism that the
spectator is supposed to feel in the Museum--that indeed one reads in the
words of the reviewersâ€”

(this is why I quoted from the "Star Spangled Banner" previously--)

and just as one runs afoul of Power in being critical of the president or of
several other agencies of Power, it apparently is almost sacrilegious to
question the Purity and "value" of Holzer's "intentions"--to not be "for"
the Museum installation is to be "against them"--and so an "enemy combatant"
as it were--because one refuses to be a blind Believer in Powerâ€”


to think that one is "resisting" and "oppositional" by "agreeing" with and
Believing in what bears the label of "opposition" and "appears to be"
manifesting the signs of this--not the action of it, but the signs of it as
read within the "Friendly Confines" of the Museum, of the Stadiumâ€”of
Homeland Securityâ€”


"rooting for the home team" as it were-- means rooting for "our" "freedom"
--to be spectatorsâ€”at the spectacle of the unfreedom of "our" own
conformityâ€”"our own" passivityâ€”"our own" unquestioning Belief in Authority
and Security--

Power itself could not be more happy--to see that those thinking of
themselves as being "resistant" to it--are simply passive spectators, paying
customers, i.e. consumers--lining up to have a rapt time of unbridled Belief
before the Icons and Figures of Authority within the safe confines and
powerful embrace of state and corporate funded Institutions--

Power, seeing how easily "the people' can be led around by the nose--one
moment unquestioningly Believing in the War and the Government's "Truth" and
the next in the "Truth" of the same documents simply displayed differently
at a different point of time, when Rummie is safely out of office and gone
to join Marjorie Perloff at Stanford-



Power, Seeing this, -then Power knows there is nothing to fear at all--from
within--as long as Fear is kept up by those Evils withoutâ€”i.e.  it's now
Iran's turn to be the Great Fear---the "new Hitler"â€”



(remember when the "new Nixon" was elected?â€”"Nixon Mach IV" as Hunter S.
Thompson dubbed that particular model)



--Iran--which Bush is attending meetings about in Israel next weekâ€”(last
week Israeli intelligence visited Washington)-Israel  has openly announced
it intends to attack Iran no matter what the latest American intelligence
reports say--because, having been wrong before, why should they be right
now?â€”


which means in reverse that they "were right the first time"--



much in the way the Rummie memos, being "right" then "wrong"  become "right"
again when hung in the Museum--when right/wrong have been shown to have been
based on false premises--why should right/wrong the next time around be
Believed in as "True"â€”yet their very "falsity" the first time aroundâ€”becomes
turned into "Truth" the second time aroundâ€”in the Museumâ€”in an attack on
Iran--

Power, seeing the workings of this running so smoothly, will feel no
compunction in launching another War--having seen that "resistance" and
"opposition" are safely ensconced in Museumsâ€”


in Museums, mind you--like "Old Masters"--and "Mummies"--the infantilized as
a friend wrote--spectator there before the First Authorities--Daddy and
Mommy--
is not this the complete triumph of Power, of Authority and is it not
fitting that the Museum installation be so reminiscent of those constructed
for the Daddy of the Third Reich/--managed and documented by Leni
Reifenstahl--lit by Speerâ€”as the plans are laid for the attack on "the new
Hitler"?--

one imagines if there were anyone in Power with any kind of sense of
humor--they would be laughing themselves silly at the realization of how
pacified and passive the population has become, when it thinks it is "free"
and "resisting" and "voicing opposition" in the contemplation of works on a
massive scale within the walls of the Museum, the ultimate receptacle of the
Past--the symbol of Historical Archives , of "purifying of the language of
the tribe" â€“of the Mummies and  Old Masters of "our" Culture--



Purifying and Canonizing, Sanctifying , so that "lies" and mistakes" become
washed clean in the Baptismal  Baths of Light and become "Projections" of
the feared and despised hidden "Truth"â€”that the spectators have become
"helpless children" in the Presence of Authorityâ€”obedient, conformist,
"enthralled" by the spectacle of their own "being good children" and
Believing in the "Truth" and "Authority" of  the Institutionalized Power of
Rummie and Mummieâ€”manifested in their sharing the same memosâ€”

      . . . ."politics makes strange bedfellows" after all--

in this argument, the love poem entered English through the romance
languages to the Elizabethans (itself arguable)

at the beginning of the twentieth century the love poem enters the poet who
would write love poetry from a variety of times and places -- and sources --
previous poets were not able to access

A while back I looked at the list and schedule for AWP's Panels. With few exceptions am I wrong to imagine that anything that happens "off-site" will be a major piece of fresh-air?!  Frankly the program - and much of the poetry under celebraton - looked like Iowa (the writing program) before Ted Berrigan momentarily crashed through the Iowa City limits  circa 1975! This is definitely ol' boys territory.   Fortunately it looks like a great number of good small presses will be represented. Maybe there will be spontaneous panels around Publishers' tables! At least the exchange of something Fresh.

 I guess it's only emblematic that "quiet" programming like this is happening in the final year of the Bush Reich.

 By the way, a delight to read Susan Stewart's Nation essay on Ben Freidlander's Selected Robert Creeley for UC Press - and that Peter Gizzi is now on board as the Nation's Poetry Editor!

When not doing battle with the truants on Staten Island in his guise as a
mild-mannered social worker, Joel Lewis can be found criss-crossing the
Jersey landscape via bus, train, PATH and light rail -- transfers and
tickets in pocket and an unlined, softback Moleskine notebook at the ready
with a Waterman rollerball pen in his right hand. His latest book, Learning
From New Jersey (Talisman House) is an all-NJ hejira that saves the reader
tunnel and Turnpike tolls. Previous books of poetry include House Rent
Boogie and Vertical's Currency. He has edited the anthology of contemporary
New Jersey poets, Bluestones and Salt Hay, along with the selected poems of
Walter Lowenfels and the selected talks of Ted Berrigan. Chris Martin is th=
e
author of American Music, recipient of the Hayden Carruth Award and
published this year by Copper Canyon Press. His poetry has appeared in
Jacket, Cannibal, Aufgabe, Lungfull!, and Swerve. His discourse on the
phenomenology of rap recently appeared in Poiesis, a journal of philosophy.
He is the editor of Puppy Flowers, an online magazine of the arts. After
living in Colorado Springs, San Francisco, and St. Paul, he is now five
years deep into Brooklyn.

Ariana Reines is the author of The Cow (Alberta Prize, FenceBooks 2006) and
Coeur de Lion (Mal-o-Mar 2007). Writing has appeared in Skanky Possum,
WebConjunctions, Soft Targets, Action, Yes, tema celeste, etc. A book of
stories, THANK YOU, is forthcoming from Mal-o-Mar, and a translation of the

intolerable.


always, I thought, intolerable.
I cried intolerable, it was a sound.
it is intolerable to decide for or against death.
if I leave a house, I may or may not return.
things may not return exactly, but most often they may return.
death is intolerable. death does not return.
I may decide, I will harbor this animal, this person, this cause.
caring, giving, are implicated; sympathy, and perhaps empathy.
this is a tending, not a shepherding or stewardship.
or a mutual tending, shepherding, stewardship.
this is a continuity, this is constant.
the decision for death is instantaneous at the moment of death.
it is intolerable to make these decisions.
a decision for life may be revoked.
then, again, at the moment of death, implying already decided.
or that action or performative accompanying.
I saw the sedative administered, needle and catheter.
even then, I could have stayed that other, harboring the moment.
I went through with it into eternal darkness.
surely Boojum did not suffer, just as surely she wanted to live.
I made a decision, for her, and against her living.
for in the theater of steel, she resisted everything and strongly.
she defended herself, lovingly as usual, her claws withdrawn,
her mind full, commodious, insistent.
she defended herself, death was the last thing on her mind.
and we held her and tried to comfort her, she growled slowly,
and then lay down and then not at all.
it is intolerable to make these decisions!
one should kill oneself after such decisions! I am a coward!
one should not make these decisions!
for one universe has ended and why should another continue?
WHY?

Yeah well it was the same in 2003 when the conference was held in =
Baltimore just as US/Britain were getting ready to invade Iraq.  Because =
the programming is proposed like 7-9 months ahead, there was NOTHING =
relevant to the political situation in those dozens & dozens (hundreds?) =
of events.  I organized a largeish panel/reading in the Enoch Pratt Free =
Library ("Barbaric Yawps") & David Fenza came through at the last minute =
with a conference slot for us (because of a cancellation).  The AWP is a =
monster, already ancient by the time it hatches.  There's life at the =
fringes & in the joints.  Last year in Atlanta I participated in the great =
reading at Eyedrum -- thanks to the Atlanta Poetry Group.  From the vivid =
but almost derelict territory outside Eyedrum, I could see the AWP hotel =
in the FAR distance: marooned on a traffic island of similar hotels.  =
Poetry goes to big ugly hotels (actually I though John Portman's hotel in =
Atlanta was STUPENDOUS!!) immune from city communities?  I don't think so. =
 AWP I'm going again this year, briefly, but ....

A while back I looked at the list and schedule for AWP's Panels. With few =
exceptions am I wrong to imagine that anything that happens "off-site" =
will be a major piece of fresh-air?!  Frankly the program - and much of =
the poetry under celebraton - looked like Iowa (the writing program) =
before Ted Berrigan momentarily crashed through the Iowa City limits  =
circa 1975! This is definitely ol' boys territory.   Fortunately it looks =
like a great number of good small presses will be represented. Maybe there =
will be spontaneous panels around Publishers' tables! At least the =
exchange of something Fresh.
 =20
 I guess it's only emblematic that "quiet" programming like this is =
happening in the final year of the Bush Reich.=20
=20
 By the way, a delight to read Susan Stewart's Nation essay on Ben =
Freidlander's Selected Robert Creeley for UC Press - and that Peter Gizzi =
is now on board as the Nation's Poetry Editor!

Every third or fifth year, I go in for a meeting & battery of tests with a
clinical psychologist, to determine if my government disability benefits get
re-instated for another several years.  I went in last month, talked for
about fifteen minutes from the most superficial vantage to my daily life,
then three hours of tests: intelligence, motor skills, auditory.  I went
back in yesterday for the results.  The practitioner, a middle aged man who
drives a silver corvette, said: "Well, you're 14% more intelligent than the
average Ph.D, you've got the motor skills of an aircraft mechanic, and your
hearing is OK."  I just looked at him for a minute, then asked what's next.
"Oh, your benefits are re-instated.  Honestly, I never revoke them from
anyone who's ever been diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.  You're free to
go.  See you in five years."

Also, it's a big thing this year that they're increasing benefits by 2 or 3
percent (as they do each year).  I guess the Bush administration wanted to
embellish this routine adjustment.  They even fooled NPR.  I laughed.

Including Medicare / Medicaid, you could say I'm actually above the poverty
line.  Some nice social workers even talk that way, like I'm earning it.
Most, in fact.  I love social workers.  I wonder what planet they come
from...

To the person who wrote "Who is Elizabeth Olds?", thank you. I was studying
Elizabeth Bishop's poetry at the time and, without realizing it, conflated
the two names. I appreciate your catching that error as I probably would not
have even on editing.

I am sorry to say that the word "Asian" is being used to refer to countries
mostly around the Pacific rim and ending basically somewhere at Himalyas,
excluding everything west of that, for instance, Pakistan, India?,
Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, etc. This points to a narrowness of vision
(partly, the way the United States assumes it is America) to combat which I
believe Kundiman was originally established.

I have thought of saying something about it for a while now. This is as good
an occasion as any.

Ciao,

Of course, to this list of Asian countries we can add many from former
Turkic Republics, Kazakstan, Ozbekistan, Kyrgizistan, Turkmanstan, in
addition to Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel, in further north, Ukraine (?), etc.

I've put a new introduction to Kluge which I think is worth looking at:

http://www.arras.net/kluge/

Still working on some of the programming, but it's nearly done, though I've
had to shelve the video fish and other elements that some of you might have
seen at presentations of mine recently. Computers are just not there yet (or
maybe I just can't program for shite).

Hope you like,
Brian

Is there such a thing as a good Inaugural Poem? How many people can remember which poet read for what prez? I remember Maya Angelo's insufferable poem during the Clinton Inaugural. I don't remember if Bush had anyone read. Dickey read for Jimmy Carter. I believe it was Robert Frost who read for Kennedy. Imagine an Ashberry poem, or something dark &  ironic, say, a Baraka poem if Obama wins. Better still, a Ginsberg clone reads for a hyper conservative Republican.

this is a poor and sleepless poem -
when something's at the limit there's nothing more to say -
for a moment i might have reversed the process
but heard nothing more than wailing or sounds like an animal -
nothing of crying, just tattered sound -
nothing of warning, fear, existence, trepidation -
nothing can be said on either side of death -
neither this one nor that one -
neither this nor the other -

today someone counted elements,
earth, fire, water, wind, air, heat, dearth,
wood, & metal -
(eighteen years and the counting of elements) -
how was the air, the air was cold, bitter,
the wind harsh, we turned the carrier against
the wind, dearth of it all, harboring a flame
until the last, dying in our arms, the metal table,
off to a far wood of hunting -
the world is filled with secret coordinates -
impermanence of the metallic -
she says she thought of the limit -
in a small heaven somewhere -
& now we are silent in the night, existence is silent -
existence crawls, we heard her cries, the catheter
carefully inserted elsewhere in the building -
we held her heat against us, we exchanged heat -
the tablets - prayer wheel spinning above a slow flame -
we couldn't bear to empty her water, clean
her bowl of food, now despair reigns, & in our arms
nothing happened, everything seized --
'this is a poor and sleepless poem' -
without goodbyes, with ill-knowledge,
with infinite regret, with the world undone -

break glass ceiling !  .........reminded me of an Adrienne Rich poem

That I can look through glass
into my neighbor's house
but not my neighbor's life
That glass is sometimes broken to save lives
That a word can be crushed like a goblet underfoot
is only what it seems, part question, part answer: how you live it

It's called "On the Pulse of Morning," and it is bearable only if you
immediately afterward read the n+7 version by Charles Bernstein (and what
collaborator?), "On the Pumice of Morons." The latter version is utterly
brilliant, just better in many ways -- if I recall correctly, "created
only a little lower than the angels" becomes "than the angiosperm."

As I recall, that poem made God so angry that he smote the wrong Washington.
:(  We didn't have power for almost a week, but it was kinda fun watching
the trees fall.

Imagine if we inaugurated a president Adrienne Rich would be willing to read
for.  "Art means nothing if it simply decorates the dinner table of the
power which holds it hostage."

I totally agree. I was eagerly scanning the entire mail for any mention of 'India' but I was very disappointed.

  Call for Papers:


Society and Sensoria: Books at the Speed of the Senses



=93=85for the skin is faster than the word=94

=96Brian Massumi, Parables for the Virtual



The 10th Biennial Pyramid Atlantic Book Arts Fair and Conference

  November 2008, in the Washington DC area

The intent of this conference is to advance a critical language for =20
artists=92 books that emphasizes both sensory-based and social =20
perspectives. Considering our societal trajectory for electronic =20
communication, as well as the increasing speed through which we =20
correspond by electronic means, we see the field confronted with the =20
following questions: What is artistic communication, and what is its =20
place or role in society? Are the uses of slower, =93handmade,=94 or =20
historical processes, often involved in the production of books, an =20
emerging form of protest or a simple refusal of technological change? =20=

How are books resisting or embracing the rapidly paced exchange of =20
information?  What do the often slow, time-consuming methods =20
surrounding the production and reception of artists=92 books mean for an =
=20
electronic society where the distribution and intensity of sensory =20
stimuli appear to be shifting? How is the reception of artists=92 books, =
=20
and the literacy they promote, affected by a potential sensory shift =20
into areas beyond the visual, in a society still dominated by visual =20
imagery?  Are artists=92 books a reaction against, or a reinforcement =20=

of, what we might call an overly visualized society? How does our =20
sense of touch relate to the predominately visual language of artists=92 =
=20
books? What is our phenomenological understanding of artists=92 books =20=

into a context of an expanded sensorium?

We are looking for papers and creative panels committed to rethinking =20=

artists=92 books as socially synthesized media devices with themes that =20=

foreground speed, touch and rhythm. We invite artists, writers, =20
critics, publishers, activists, students, and educators, to articulate =20=

how we experience books under the particular conditions of handling, =20
reading, and viewing, in a context of social interconnection and =20
difference.

We encourage presentations from, but not limited to, the following =20
areas: artists=92 books, visual and performing arts, visual and cultural =
=20
studies, visual anthropology, cognitive science, sociology, analytic =20
philosophy, comparative literature, literary theory, linguistics, =20
political science and activism.

The following are examples of potential topics.  Presenters, however, =20=

are in no way limited by them:



=B7      Speed of space and rhythm in books



=B7      Haptic interface and books



=B7      Phenomenology of artists=92 books



=B7      Embodiment and books



=B7      Devotion to craft as content



=B7      Time-consumption and memory



=B7      E-flux versus paper permanence



=B7      Techno culture as a site of confrontation with books



=B7      Synthesis of electronic information into non-electronic books



The conference runs in tandem with a biennial fair for well-known and =20=

emerging artists, publishers and dealers in the field of artists=92 =20
books.  We intend to create synergy between the fair and conference by =20=

extending lines of communication between the various parties involved =20=

in the fair and will make special effort to link books exhibited in =20
the fair to the conference presentations. We encourage conference =20
presenters to consider such a link as they develop their papers.



Please send abstracts of no more than 500 words by JANUARY 15, 2008 to:



Tate Shaw and Ward Tietz



pyramidatlantic08@gmail.com



With your proposal, please include a current CV.



The conference will provide a modest honorarium, though we strongly =20
encourage participants to apply for funding in their home regions and/=20=

or through institutions with which they are affiliated. Please do not =20=

hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Robert Frost wrote a poem called "Dedication" for JFK's inauguration but because he was old (87) and because the sun was shining on the page, plus his unfamiliarity with the new poem, he recited from memory a poem called "The Gift Outright" instead, which was a better poem anyway.  Sheila Black


                                            "Dedication"

"... The glory of a next Augustan age
 Of a power leading from its strength and pride,
 Of young amibition eager to be tried,
 Firm in our free beliefs without dismay,
 In any game the nations want to play.
 A golden age of poetry and power
 Of which this noonday's the beginning hour."

   and


  ~ The Gift Outright  ~

  The land was ours before we were the land's.
 She was our land more than a hundred years
 Before we were her people.  She was ours
 In Massachusetts, in Virginia.
 But we were England's, still colonials,
 Possessing what we still were unpossessed by,
 Possessed by what we now no more possessed.
 Something we were withholding made us weak.
 Until we found out that it was ourselves
 We were withholding from our land of living,
 And forthwith found salvation in surrender.
 Such as we were we gave ourselves outright
 (The deed of gift was many deeds of war)
 To the land vaguely realizing westward,
 But still unstoried, artless, unenhanced,
 Such as she was, such as she would become.

  ~ Robert Frost; 1874-1963 ~

N+7 poems are stupid, one and all. There is no cleverness, no craft, no wit, no
art, in any of them. Art is not, and cannot be, random, because an endeavor
based on randomness is mere time-wasting: the results cannot be significant
or important. In particular, N+7 cannot "spoof" anything because the very
notion of a parody or spoof is to be an intentionally significant (and maybe an
important) act. No N+7 substitution can be either significant or important
because art is a matter of human intentions, not a matter of the mere
propinquity of words in a particular edition of a particular dictionary. Removing
human intention from the endeavor removes the possibility of art.

What's clever or witty about a mechanical change of "pulse of morning" to
"pumice of morons"? Nothing, unless you thought it up yourself. As an act of
human creativity to go on from you'd have something to go forward with. But
of course the N+7 method offers nothing even faintly resembling a way to go
forward with, and even less of human creativity.

And what is clever or even interesting about mechanically substituting "a little
lower than the angiosperm" for "a little lower than the angels"? Again, if you'd
thought it up, it might be an interesting place to go forward from, but it is not
gone forward from. Worse, it has no meaningful connection to the "pumice of
morons". Neither phrase has the least wit or art when the result of merely
mechanical selection because without human intention the entire enterprise is
dead on arrival. Algorithms do not write poems -- people do.

N+7 offers nothing whatever since the idea of parody or spoof is to show, by
human intention, how badly some other human intention has gone wrong. N+7
is no more a parody or spoof of anything than mowing the lawn is a parody or
spoof of grass.

Mechanical word substitutions do not create parodies -- people of
accomplishment do -- and they must, since the nature of parodies and spoofs
requires that the writer and reader are familiar with the original, with the
context in which the original was offered, and the changed context in which
the parody is offered. N+7 not only is no satire, no parody, and no spoof, but it
cannot be: to mechanically substitute N+7 to someone's poem and then
purport to laugh at the ridiculousnesses thereby engendered because you'd
get the same proportion of the same sorts of ridiculousnesses by
mechanically substituting N+7 for ANY poem. It is no accomplishment. For
people who want to be thought of as people of accomplishment it's worse than
that: it's inviting your friends over for dinner and serving them the excrement
you've fished out of your toilet bowl instead: it's an insult to your friends, not to
the notion of dinner.

In short, N+7 is self-evident incompetence. Randomness as the basis for art is
the first refuge of scoundrels and the last word in confidence tricks.

Thank you Jim, Barry and Stephen for your responses--

perhaps new forms of "travel literature" need to be invented for the voyage
to the end of the infinite, into the unknown, which is signalled by the
"Projections" and their "oppositions" via doublings and reversals,
mirrorings and copyings . . . .

"he did not want to compose another *Don Quixote*--which would be
easy--but*the Don Quixote.
*It is unnecessary to add that his aim was never to produce a mechanical
transcription of the original;  he did not propose to copy it.  His
admirable ambition was to produce pages which would coincide,--word for word
and line for line--with those of Miguel de Cervantes."

--Jorge Luis Borges, "Pierre Menard"

'He was obliged to *express *himself in a a language of *non-expression*, to
make himself *understood* by the same means he had and sought and tested in
order *not to be understood*.  He had to communicate through the language of
non-communication.  Out of necessity.  That is through censorship and
self-censorship.  As a prisoner.  As a spy in enemy territory and under
enemy supervision."

-Leonarado Sciascia, *The Moro Affair*
*
*Often what is written is "unreadable" because other aspects of it are more
easily "read into," thus producing a text which though unwritten is read in
preference to that which is written but "unreadable."

Reading and unreadability may indeed co-exist simply as things "in the mind
and eye of the beholder."  One may read into texts things not there, in the
desire of finding them--as the Bush administration's pressured intelligence
agencies felt happened to their "findings" and memos- which had, by virtue
of said pressures, turned into "evidences" used for War--regardless of their
being forgeries or outright raving lies---and at the same time remark on the
"unreadability" of what one does not want to read, or does not know how to
read.  Much that is written is unwritten and much that is read is unread.
What is written that is read is often the area in which "unreadability" is
discussed, for only in that area of supreme certainty can such judgement be
passed.

For who would want to read an unreadable text on unreadability?  Other than
a non-writer of readable works.?  Or a non-reader of written works, or even
better, a non-writer of non-readable books.  The dilemma of "criticism" is
trying to chose which "readings" it will "write about" when copying or
interrogating a text. After all, the highly trained expert cannot admit to
an "unwritability" on his or her own part, whatever merits of readability
the text may posses!!

The primary concern in writing re the Rumsfeld/Holzer  memos collaborative
"Projections" is that in all the reading produced by the writings of the
pair, the spectator/reader is "written out"
and "condemned" as it were to the nether worlds of "unwritability," a
relatively "quiet" zone as in a library where the readers are instructed to
remain as hushed as possible.  The spectator literally carries the "burden"
of the projected lines of the for the most part unwritten about poetry of "a
Nobel Prize Winner," (cited as though certifying the pedigree of the "show"
dog and horse at a dog and pony show), which are "lost in translation" in
the transition from "lines" and "letters" to "light" and "shadows" moving
disembodiedly about on the "lit" and "shrouded" bodies of the "visitors" to
the  "morgue" of "dead civilizations" which a Museum was often seen as being
by "avant-gardes of the past" that have become the "retro-fashions" of the
"near Future" of "next season's shows," and "upcoming revivals."

Bartleby, who had once worked in the "Dead Letters Office, " perished in the
Egyptian darknesses of The Tombs, having decided he would "prefer not to" be
a copier of other's "deadly" memos any more. Perhaps the "Projections"
signal the opposite.


{re unreadbaility from a different aspect :
*UNREADABILITY On the Road from Alexia to Zaum
*www.pd.org/topos/perforations/perf26/*chirot*.html }

In Borges' story of Pierre Menard, a "minor" French belle-lettriste devotes
his life to producing thousands of pages of writing that he destroys, while
managing along the way to produce, word for word, some complete chapters of
the Quixote of Cervantes.  Yet while each word is the same in the two
versions, Menard's, Borges' narrator tells us, is infinitely richer.  While
Cervantes' text, written in the colloquial language of his time, is
unremarkable for this very reason, Menard's text, written centuries later by
a foreigner to the language and culture, brings a life to Cervantes' text
which it never before possessed.  The platitudes and cliched phrasings of
the "idees recues"  of the times which one finds in the Quixote of
Cervantes, become, written by Menard during the modern era of William
James--(and around the time of Unamuno's Cervantes text)-- words of a
challenging depth and insight.  The Menard, in short, is in every way  the
superior work,leaving Cervantes' far behind, in the dustbins of history,
relegated to the status of an old paperweight for the more cumbersome heaps
of "dead letters" littering the busy desks of the omnivorous reader.  In
short, by writing word for word the Quixote, Menard has surpassed it,
rendering the original superfluous, and created a new text which via its
"redoubling of effort" is infinitely richer in meaning, superior in style
and pregnant with provocative and philosophical  thoughts.

By reversing and doubling Rummie's memos, has not Holzer become the Menard
to his Cervantes?  Are we not now witnessing an infinitely richer,
stylistically superior and much more philosophically provocative work in
Holzer's "Projections" of the mere "common, everday, colloquial" words and
marks of the discredited former Secretary?

And is not this massive copying and projecting, this huge display of a
"redoubling of effort" quite the opposite of Bartelby's obscure and shadowy
"I prefer not to", which fades away into nothingness in The Tombs, the
mirroring doubled reversal of the Museum?

The Prison as mirror to the Museum----

The "Egyptian" Tombs with their living dead and the Modern Museums with
their "living dead"--the Still Living Great Artists now hobnobbing quite
fashionably and familiarly  with the Great Deads  of the Past, all under the
sign of the Timelessness of Great and Eternal Art.

As Henri Rousseau remarked with great feeling to Picasso:  "We are the great
painters of our Epoch.  You in the Egyptian style, and I in the Modern."

For Bartleby, as for Melville, death came to an almost entirely forgotten
being. Only in the Eternal Timelessness of Art do we find them "emblematic"
and "significant"  and "connect with them." Paul Metcalf in a letter noted
that the "South Sea Island Romances"  of his great-grandfather were being
taught at a college in Missouri alongside the "Hawiian Films of Elvis
Presley" as examples images of the Pacific in American culture.

Rather than censorship, the nature of Interrogation and the Interrogation of
the Text, is to  FORCE THE PRISONER/TEXT TO SPEAK.  It does not matter if
what the prisoner/text says is a reversed doubling of "giving them what they
want to hear" or perhaps a "hitherto concealed secret," for these are the
same thing.  What matters is that silence has been unsilenced, broken,
literally and figuratively, and there is THE PRODUCTION OF LANGUAGE, OF
TEXT, which is now in the Interrogator's  possession.

Copying the text, "interrogating the text," what is the goal if not the
production of a replacement text, to replace silence, to replace "the
original?"  And, in full possession of the"infinitely richer," stylistically
superior and philosophically  more provocative "copy" or "confession," is it
not more than high time to broadcast this to the world via "Projections," in
a spectacle of a "Triumph of the Will?"

The corollary to the "Projections'" enthusiastically embraced exhibition is
the the discomfort with which the Guantanamo Poems The Detainees Speak
volume was received.  A book that most do not want to and will not read, and
claim that by not reading it, they are "not missing anything" because they
have read or heard it is "bad poetry" and as well, a "production of the
Pentagon," if not of Satan and "Islamo-Fascism."

On the one hand, the copying of the words of the discredited Secretary of
Defense and their "Projections" are considered "Great Art," while the words
of detainees FORCED TO SPEAK, then only allowed to be translated by
non-literary translators under strict supervision are of course exactly what
the Pentagon and the Poetry World want them to be--"bad poetry" by "bad
people" with whom there is a "clash of cultures" in which "they" don't
Support or Believe in the same wonders "we" do--i.e. the originals and the
copies of Rumsfield/Holzer's memos, the beauties and phliosophical inquiries
of "Projections" of the Language of the State as the State of the Language,
poetic and otherwise.

The writings produced by torture and interrogation which Rummie
enthusiastically encouraged, and their interrogations as texts before,
during and after their production, translation and publication, has
subjected the Guantanamo poets and their texts to the full battery of the
Projections of Shock and Awe.  The electricity triumphantly illuminating the
Rummie/Holzer collaborations viewed in the Museum setting of the
Timelessness of Great Art, is the same electricity used to torture the
detainees and essay the production of texts, any old texts, from their lips,
let alone the damaged minds and hands of persons repeatedly subjected to the
jolts of   "Old Sparky's" cousins and the joys of Water Boarding which the
new Attorney General at his confirmation hearings  may have confused with a
form of surfing on the beaches of Guantanamo Bay.

The Museum texts bathed in light--and cells in which the lights never go
off.  Or, when off, may be off for months at a time.  While the eyesight of
the detainees is damaged, ad the text they hold Sacred is routinely abused
in front of them, Museum goers find themselves in "awe" of the artistic
handling of The secretary's texts, subtly modulated, enriched, nuanced, deep
with cultural resonances echoing in the vast halls as they are projected for
an enthusiastic and respectful hushed paying audience. The complex and
ambiguous play of "oppositions" among the doublings, mirrorings and
reversals creates a pleasantly narcotic  euphoria, a sort of "higher
consciousness" via a language of "unforgetfulness" which is "safe and secure
from all alarm" and at the same time poised at the ready for the sounds of
alarm. For who knows when the next Attack on Homeland Security may occur and
the Museum itself be targeted? In which case, the "Projections" turn readily
into into Super High Beam Search Lights fingering the sky as hitherto
concealed anti-aircraft guns appear with astounding speed  from behind the
Paintings of the Memos.

On the one hand, everything possible is done to "torture" the poetry out of
poetry, to create a non-poetry for non-readers.  On the other hand, a poetry
of reversed and doubled projections of the memos of Power, accepted as a New
Art that is "infinitely richer" and "more powerful more eloquent" than any
words of any "enemy combatant" could never be.

On the one hand the "barbaric writing" of the detainees, non-writing for
non-readers,(which is to be "the end of literature") in the same formulation
that "barbaric writing" is described in an essay written under a pseudonym
by the Chilean Air Force  Lieutenant torturer, serial killer and "poet"
Carlos Wieder in Roberto Bolano's *Distant Star*--and on the other, the
"civilized" Museum of "Projections" accorded the full opprobrium of the
culture's elites combining as they do the elite of the Government and that
of the Art World.


The larger the "Projections" "broadcast" their messages, the more they
project unreadability on to the bodies and eyes of the spectators.  The
flowing letters of light of the poetry of Szymborska vanish into the
"stability" of the enlarged lettering of the memos.  And what are memos for
but to ensure and reinforce "unforgetfullness"?  That is, the
"unforgettably" of the "twice amplified"  memos and the "forgetability" of
the "unreadable" poetry.

As Jack Spicer said, looking out over the Pacific Ocean:  "No one listens to
poetry."  And many years later in the film "Atlantic City," Burt Lancaster
gazed out in the opposite direction and murmured, "Not even the Atlantic
Ocean is what it used to be."



Meanwhile, discredited as military man, a "failure" in the eyes of a mocking
world, --and what easier time to kick a man in a Museum than when he is
down--"Rummie" has none the less heard the Call of Vocation and resettled at
Stanford, there to go into Post Doctoral Poetics Studies with Dr Perloff.
By using the methods of one her favorite "radical Artificers," Charles
Bernstein, Dr Perloff and Rumzer (as he is now known, in defference to
Holfeld)  are hoping to capitalize on the recognitions accorded his memos
and find ways to turn his military "misfortune" into the Future of Poetry, a
"Restoration of Futurism" via the hindsight of the 21st Century.  For in the
foresight born of hindsight lies the restoration of the future as a superior
copy of the past.

As Dr Perloff outlines briefly in a memo subtly echoing those of the
Secretary, the method Bernstein takes in hand  is the old "bait and
switch,"  in which cliches and "official verse"are reversed, "doubling their
pleasure, doubling their fun" by this clever method of "turning them inside
out."   The redoubling of cliches and platitudes, their mirrorings and
reversals, allows Bernstein to produce the same "truisms" as now infinitely
richer and wittier poetic and philosophical paradigms, which if "reverse
engineered" also allow one to produce from the same "anti-capitalist"
reversed words the stunning  High Capitalist High Art moment of advertising
for the Yellow Pages of Businesses during the Corporate Non Plus Ultra Half
Time of the Super Bowl.  This ultimate in Big Screen Big Audience
"Projection," Rumzer is beginning to see, is what makes the possibilities of
this method so "infinitely richer," stylistically superior and fraught with
philosophical significance.  In a moment of breathless anticipation too
great to stifle,Dr Perloff  has even let Rumzer know that no matter who if
anyone is "elected," or,even if there is an "election," the Inaugural Poem
will be from now on the sole provenance of Dr Bernstein, the Old Master of
turning doggerel into an Inaugural and vice versa.

"I'm beginning to catch your drift--" Rumzer  writes back, deliberately
re-using the same but now "infinitely richer" Rumzer colloquialisms as
before,  just as he re-uses with stylistic superiority the same set of memo
papers he once did in the Office, (now sold, even blank, as Collector's
Items on EBay) having left Office with hundreds of boxes of them. "See you
tonight at eight. Or make that ate," he adds with a "poetic" flourish,
ravenous already for his "dinner date."

Clinking their cut glass crystal chalices of wine, ever mindful of the
starched white expanses of table linen, the "couple at the corner table"
reserved  for those deserving of privacy for their intimate tete-a-tetes,
gaze  assertively and affirmingly into each other's eyes, their free hands
poised in intimate proximity with pencils at the ready beside the finest
specimens of handmade paper. In the enveloping warmth of the vast dining
room, basking in the fragrance of the very best fresh cut flowers, Dr and
Secretary set to work with pencils, knives  and forks at the task of
creating the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry.

O Museum Muse, by whom MEMO is reversed as "O mem(e)!" O reversed mirrored
double image"Projected"  onto the bodies of spectators so that Rummie
becomes an "artist known as Rumzer"  reversed into a "Secretary of Defense"
known as Holfeld projected on to the "screens" of their eyes.  Eyes which
now "see" Rumzer's words as "art" and Holfeld's as a "new American
military," "mobilized" and "light"--easily able to be "launched" from any of
close to 700 "military bases" worldwide--now reversed into "museums"--in the
reversal of Marinetti's "war the world's hygiene," which does away with
Museums--now the Museum is the projector of a "hygienic war" which
"cleanses" "enemy combatants" and makes them into "spectators of art"--

in fact, one might envision the good Dr. suggesting to the former Secretary
that  a study of Marinetti's Futurist "Parole in Liberta" (precursor of Il
Maestro Fondatore's  Parole in Liberace, in turn Il Fondatore's contribution
to "The Grand Piano" and included in its archives) , with its battlefield
sounds and arrows pointing directions of attacks, placements of artillery,
"bombs bursting in air," might be of some real use and  interest in the
Secretary's development of the "sketches" of the memos into a more sustained
"elaboration" --"con vivo" --of his already extensive and barely tapped
"command" of  military nomenclature and rhythms.  And so, this surprising
and intriguing "Dynamic Duo," working long hours after hours at an
"undisclosed location," proceed with the production of a "Tour de Force,"
powerful generator of a "Coup d'Etat," a "Regime Change" within the
hierarchies of American Poetics and the MLA ushering in the era of the New
Extreme Experimental American poetry.

 And as Secretary of The Projections of a New American Military, Ms. Holfeld
and Dr Bernstein assume their rightful places in the Coup d"Etat of a New
Regime of the American Extreme Experimental Democratic Republic .

 "this is my last communique from the planet of the monsters.  Never again
will I immerse myself in literature's bottomless cesspools.  I will go back
to writing my poems, such as they are, find a job to keep body and soul
together, and make no attempt to be published."
--Roberto Bolano, Distant Star

I'm so glad we have you here to define art for us. Thank you.

Parody too. Great allusion to the Samuel Johnson quote. Very clever.

And the zinger: "Removing human intention from the endeavor removes the
possibility of art."

Absolutely ridiculous. That intention be equated to the artist's "meaning
to," as in, I meant for this poem to be about a one-eyed kitten that I found
while walking in my field of barley or whatever rather than the art of the
absurd: the ridiculousness of writing about dead kittens and one-eyed, is
absurd. Even more so is the notion that had I not gone walking and had I not
discovered said maimed -- now dead -- kitten, I'd never write what some
might consider a work of art. So where does the removal of normatively
"inaugural" phrases and ideas and replacing them with nullified
"substitutes" fall on the scale of spoof/parody? If anything, spoofing the
haughty and pseudo-epic language of inaugural poems certainly seems needed.
And this is where I really disagree:  On the Pumice of Morons isn't a
parody, but a way to declaw the uselessness of On the Pulse of Morning. It
doesn't have to represent the text it attempts to subvert. It becomes the
text it subverts. It's a substitute teacher whose job is to ruin what you
know about Pulses and Mornings, a red red herring.

Art comes from many angles, usually where it's needed, regardless of
intention. If manipulation of an image (as in CGI, or computer generated
image, based on programs, code and algorithms) is free of intention, is it
not art? What of the endless future possibilities of  its art-ness?

I see the N+7 as --at worst-- a prompt. At best, it's a way to remove false
language from its speaker. Namely, language used not to speak of the
situation to be described, but to reflect back onto the speaker. This is
what politicians do. I'm wondering what the point of  your outrage might be?
If I like country music and you hate it is it your duty to insult my taste
(with irrational appeals) until you convert me? Is the N+7 representative of
something that you really hate that much?



Best,

Ryan Daley

For who would want to read an unreadable text on unreadability?

Perhaps the late Samuel Beckett. As usual, cool essay.



David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote: Thank you Jim, Barry and Stephen for your responses--

perhaps new forms of "travel literature" need to be invented for the voyage
to the end of the infinite, into the unknown, which is signalled by the
"Projections" and their "oppositions" via doublings and reversals,
mirrorings and copyings . . . .

"he did not want to compose another *Don Quixote*--which would be
easy--but*the Don Quixote.
*It is unnecessary to add that his aim was never to produce a mechanical
transcription of the original;  he did not propose to copy it.  His
admirable ambition was to produce pages which would coincide,--word for word
and line for line--with those of Miguel de Cervantes."

--Jorge Luis Borges, "Pierre Menard"

'He was obliged to *express *himself in a a language of *non-expression*, to
make himself *understood* by the same means he had and sought and tested in
order *not to be understood*.  He had to communicate through the language of
non-communication.  Out of necessity.  That is through censorship and
self-censorship.  As a prisoner.  As a spy in enemy territory and under
enemy supervision."

-Leonarado Sciascia, *The Moro Affair*
*
*Often what is written is "unreadable" because other aspects of it are more
easily "read into," thus producing a text which though unwritten is read in
preference to that which is written but "unreadable."

Reading and unreadability may indeed co-exist simply as things "in the mind
and eye of the beholder."  One may read into texts things not there, in the
desire of finding them--as the Bush administration's pressured intelligence
agencies felt happened to their "findings" and memos- which had, by virtue
of said pressures, turned into "evidences" used for War--regardless of their
being forgeries or outright raving lies---and at the same time remark on the
"unreadability" of what one does not want to read, or does not know how to
read.  Much that is written is unwritten and much that is read is unread.
What is written that is read is often the area in which "unreadability" is
discussed, for only in that area of supreme certainty can such judgement be
passed.

For who would want to read an unreadable text on unreadability?  Other than
a non-writer of readable works.?  Or a non-reader of written works, or even
better, a non-writer of non-readable books.  The dilemma of "criticism" is
trying to chose which "readings" it will "write about" when copying or
interrogating a text. After all, the highly trained expert cannot admit to
an "unwritability" on his or her own part, whatever merits of readability
the text may posses!!

The primary concern in writing re the Rumsfeld/Holzer  memos collaborative
"Projections" is that in all the reading produced by the writings of the
pair, the spectator/reader is "written out"
and "condemned" as it were to the nether worlds of "unwritability," a
relatively "quiet" zone as in a library where the readers are instructed to
remain as hushed as possible.  The spectator literally carries the "burden"
of the projected lines of the for the most part unwritten about poetry of "a
Nobel Prize Winner," (cited as though certifying the pedigree of the "show"
dog and horse at a dog and pony show), which are "lost in translation" in
the transition from "lines" and "letters" to "light" and "shadows" moving
disembodiedly about on the "lit" and "shrouded" bodies of the "visitors" to
the  "morgue" of "dead civilizations" which a Museum was often seen as being
by "avant-gardes of the past" that have become the "retro-fashions" of the
"near Future" of "next season's shows," and "upcoming revivals."

Bartleby, who had once worked in the "Dead Letters Office, " perished in the
Egyptian darknesses of The Tombs, having decided he would "prefer not to" be
a copier of other's "deadly" memos any more. Perhaps the "Projections"
signal the opposite.

his life to producing thousands of pages of writing that he destroys, while
managing along the way to produce, word for word, some complete chapters of
the Quixote of Cervantes.  Yet while each word is the same in the two
versions, Menard's, Borges' narrator tells us, is infinitely richer.  While
Cervantes' text, written in the colloquial language of his time, is
unremarkable for this very reason, Menard's text, written centuries later by
a foreigner to the language and culture, brings a life to Cervantes' text
which it never before possessed.  The platitudes and cliched phrasings of
the "idees recues"  of the times which one finds in the Quixote of
Cervantes, become, written by Menard during the modern era of William
James--(and around the time of Unamuno's Cervantes text)-- words of a
challenging depth and insight.  The Menard, in short, is in every way  the
superior work,leaving Cervantes' far behind, in the dustbins of history,
relegated to the status of an old paperweight for the more cumbersome heaps
of "dead letters" littering the busy desks of the omnivorous reader.  In
short, by writing word for word the Quixote, Menard has surpassed it,
rendering the original superfluous, and created a new text which via its
"redoubling of effort" is infinitely richer in meaning, superior in style
and pregnant with provocative and philosophical  thoughts.

By reversing and doubling Rummie's memos, has not Holzer become the Menard
to his Cervantes?  Are we not now witnessing an infinitely richer,
stylistically superior and much more philosophically provocative work in
Holzer's "Projections" of the mere "common, everday, colloquial" words and
marks of the discredited former Secretary?

And is not this massive copying and projecting, this huge display of a
"redoubling of effort" quite the opposite of Bartelby's obscure and shadowy
"I prefer not to", which fades away into nothingness in The Tombs, the
mirroring doubled reversal of the Museum?

The Prison as mirror to the Museum----

The "Egyptian" Tombs with their living dead and the Modern Museums with
their "living dead"--the Still Living Great Artists now hobnobbing quite
fashionably and familiarly  with the Great Deads  of the Past, all under the
sign of the Timelessness of Great and Eternal Art.

As Henri Rousseau remarked with great feeling to Picasso:  "We are the great
painters of our Epoch.  You in the Egyptian style, and I in the Modern."

For Bartleby, as for Melville, death came to an almost entirely forgotten
being. Only in the Eternal Timelessness of Art do we find them "emblematic"
and "significant"  and "connect with them." Paul Metcalf in a letter noted
that the "South Sea Island Romances"  of his great-grandfather were being
taught at a college in Missouri alongside the "Hawiian Films of Elvis
Presley" as examples images of the Pacific in American culture.

Rather than censorship, the nature of Interrogation and the Interrogation of
the Text, is to  FORCE THE PRISONER/TEXT TO SPEAK.  It does not matter if
what the prisoner/text says is a reversed doubling of "giving them what they
want to hear" or perhaps a "hitherto concealed secret," for these are the
same thing.  What matters is that silence has been unsilenced, broken,
literally and figuratively, and there is THE PRODUCTION OF LANGUAGE, OF
TEXT, which is now in the Interrogator's  possession.

Copying the text, "interrogating the text," what is the goal if not the
production of a replacement text, to replace silence, to replace "the
original?"  And, in full possession of the"infinitely richer," stylistically
superior and philosophically  more provocative "copy" or "confession," is it
not more than high time to broadcast this to the world via "Projections," in
a spectacle of a "Triumph of the Will?"

The corollary to the "Projections'" enthusiastically embraced exhibition is
the the discomfort with which the Guantanamo Poems The Detainees Speak
volume was received.  A book that most do not want to and will not read, and
claim that by not reading it, they are "not missing anything" because they
have read or heard it is "bad poetry" and as well, a "production of the
Pentagon," if not of Satan and "Islamo-Fascism."

On the one hand, the copying of the words of the discredited Secretary of
Defense and their "Projections" are considered "Great Art," while the words
of detainees FORCED TO SPEAK, then only allowed to be translated by
non-literary translators under strict supervision are of course exactly what
the Pentagon and the Poetry World want them to be--"bad poetry" by "bad
people" with whom there is a "clash of cultures" in which "they" don't
Support or Believe in the same wonders "we" do--i.e. the originals and the
copies of Rumsfield/Holzer's memos, the beauties and phliosophical inquiries
of "Projections" of the Language of the State as the State of the Language,
poetic and otherwise.

The writings produced by torture and interrogation which Rummie
enthusiastically encouraged, and their interrogations as texts before,
during and after their production, translation and publication, has
subjected the Guantanamo poets and their texts to the full battery of the
Projections of Shock and Awe.  The electricity triumphantly illuminating the
Rummie/Holzer collaborations viewed in the Museum setting of the
Timelessness of Great Art, is the same electricity used to torture the
detainees and essay the production of texts, any old texts, from their lips,
let alone the damaged minds and hands of persons repeatedly subjected to the
jolts of   "Old Sparky's" cousins and the joys of Water Boarding which the
new Attorney General at his confirmation hearings  may have confused with a
form of surfing on the beaches of Guantanamo Bay.

The Museum texts bathed in light--and cells in which the lights never go
off.  Or, when off, may be off for months at a time.  While the eyesight of
the detainees is damaged, ad the text they hold Sacred is routinely abused
in front of them, Museum goers find themselves in "awe" of the artistic
handling of The secretary's texts, subtly modulated, enriched, nuanced, deep
with cultural resonances echoing in the vast halls as they are projected for
an enthusiastic and respectful hushed paying audience. The complex and
ambiguous play of "oppositions" among the doublings, mirrorings and
reversals creates a pleasantly narcotic  euphoria, a sort of "higher
consciousness" via a language of "unforgetfulness" which is "safe and secure
from all alarm" and at the same time poised at the ready for the sounds of
alarm. For who knows when the next Attack on Homeland Security may occur and
the Museum itself be targeted? In which case, the "Projections" turn readily
into into Super High Beam Search Lights fingering the sky as hitherto
concealed anti-aircraft guns appear with astounding speed  from behind the
Paintings of the Memos.

On the one hand, everything possible is done to "torture" the poetry out of
poetry, to create a non-poetry for non-readers.  On the other hand, a poetry
of reversed and doubled projections of the memos of Power, accepted as a New
Art that is "infinitely richer" and "more powerful more eloquent" than any
words of any "enemy combatant" could never be.

On the one hand the "barbaric writing" of the detainees, non-writing for
non-readers,(which is to be "the end of literature") in the same formulation
that "barbaric writing" is described in an essay written under a pseudonym
by the Chilean Air Force  Lieutenant torturer, serial killer and "poet"
Carlos Wieder in Roberto Bolano's *Distant Star*--and on the other, the
"civilized" Museum of "Projections" accorded the full opprobrium of the
culture's elites combining as they do the elite of the Government and that
of the Art World.


The larger the "Projections" "broadcast" their messages, the more they
project unreadability on to the bodies and eyes of the spectators.  The
flowing letters of light of the poetry of Szymborska vanish into the
"stability" of the enlarged lettering of the memos.  And what are memos for
but to ensure and reinforce "unforgetfullness"?  That is, the
"unforgettably" of the "twice amplified"  memos and the "forgetability" of
the "unreadable" poetry.

As Jack Spicer said, looking out over the Pacific Ocean:  "No one listens to
poetry."  And many years later in the film "Atlantic City," Burt Lancaster
gazed out in the opposite direction and murmured, "Not even the Atlantic
Ocean is what it used to be."



Meanwhile, discredited as military man, a "failure" in the eyes of a mocking
world, --and what easier time to kick a man in a Museum than when he is
down--"Rummie" has none the less heard the Call of Vocation and resettled at
Stanford, there to go into Post Doctoral Poetics Studies with Dr Perloff.
By using the methods of one her favorite "radical Artificers," Charles
Bernstein, Dr Perloff and Rumzer (as he is now known, in defference to
Holfeld)  are hoping to capitalize on the recognitions accorded his memos
and find ways to turn his military "misfortune" into the Future of Poetry, a
"Restoration of Futurism" via the hindsight of the 21st Century.  For in the
foresight born of hindsight lies the restoration of the future as a superior
copy of the past.

As Dr Perloff outlines briefly in a memo subtly echoing those of the
Secretary, the method Bernstein takes in hand  is the old "bait and
switch,"  in which cliches and "official verse"are reversed, "doubling their
pleasure, doubling their fun" by this clever method of "turning them inside
out."   The redoubling of cliches and platitudes, their mirrorings and
reversals, allows Bernstein to produce the same "truisms" as now infinitely
richer and wittier poetic and philosophical paradigms, which if "reverse
engineered" also allow one to produce from the same "anti-capitalist"
reversed words the stunning  High Capitalist High Art moment of advertising
for the Yellow Pages of Businesses during the Corporate Non Plus Ultra Half
Time of the Super Bowl.  This ultimate in Big Screen Big Audience
"Projection," Rumzer is beginning to see, is what makes the possibilities of
this method so "infinitely richer," stylistically superior and fraught with
philosophical significance.  In a moment of breathless anticipation too
great to stifle,Dr Perloff  has even let Rumzer know that no matter who if
anyone is "elected," or,even if there is an "election," the Inaugural Poem
will be from now on the sole provenance of Dr Bernstein, the Old Master of
turning doggerel into an Inaugural and vice versa.

"I'm beginning to catch your drift--" Rumzer  writes back, deliberately
re-using the same but now "infinitely richer" Rumzer colloquialisms as
before,  just as he re-uses with stylistic superiority the same set of memo
papers he once did in the Office, (now sold, even blank, as Collector's
Items on EBay) having left Office with hundreds of boxes of them. "See you
tonight at eight. Or make that ate," he adds with a "poetic" flourish,
ravenous already for his "dinner date."

Clinking their cut glass crystal chalices of wine, ever mindful of the
starched white expanses of table linen, the "couple at the corner table"
reserved  for those deserving of privacy for their intimate tete-a-tetes,
gaze  assertively and affirmingly into each other's eyes, their free hands
poised in intimate proximity with pencils at the ready beside the finest
specimens of handmade paper. In the enveloping warmth of the vast dining
room, basking in the fragrance of the very best fresh cut flowers, Dr and
Secretary set to work with pencils, knives  and forks at the task of
creating the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry.

O Museum Muse, by whom MEMO is reversed as "O mem(e)!" O reversed mirrored
double image"Projected"  onto the bodies of spectators so that Rummie
becomes an "artist known as Rumzer"  reversed into a "Secretary of Defense"
known as Holfeld projected on to the "screens" of their eyes.  Eyes which
now "see" Rumzer's words as "art" and Holfeld's as a "new American
military," "mobilized" and "light"--easily able to be "launched" from any of
close to 700 "military bases" worldwide--now reversed into "museums"--in the
reversal of Marinetti's "war the world's hygiene," which does away with
Museums--now the Museum is the projector of a "hygienic war" which
"cleanses" "enemy combatants" and makes them into "spectators of art"--

in fact, one might envision the good Dr. suggesting to the former Secretary
that  a study of Marinetti's Futurist "Parole in Liberta" (precursor of Il
Maestro Fondatore's  Parole in Liberace, in turn Il Fondatore's contribution
to "The Grand Piano" and included in its archives) , with its battlefield
sounds and arrows pointing directions of attacks, placements of artillery,
"bombs bursting in air," might be of some real use and  interest in the
Secretary's development of the "sketches" of the memos into a more sustained
"elaboration" --"con vivo" --of his already extensive and barely tapped
"command" of  military nomenclature and rhythms.  And so, this surprising
and intriguing "Dynamic Duo," working long hours after hours at an
"undisclosed location," proceed with the production of a "Tour de Force,"
powerful generator of a "Coup d'Etat," a "Regime Change" within the
hierarchies of American Poetics and the MLA ushering in the era of the New
Extreme Experimental American poetry.

 And as Secretary of The Projections of a New American Military, Ms. Holfeld
and Dr Bernstein assume their rightful places in the Coup d"Etat of a New
Regime of the American Extreme Experimental Democratic Republic .

 "this is my last communique from the planet of the monsters.  Never again
will I immerse myself in literature's bottomless cesspools.  I will go back
to writing my poems, such as they are, find a job to keep body and soul
together, and make no attempt to be published."
--Roberto Bolano, Distant Star

That's the point! "The pumice of morons" means nothing in particular --
and neither does "the pulse of morning." "Created only a little lower than
the angiosperm" is random, but in its randomness, actually more
provocative than the original trite glurge, "than the angels."

Angelou is the one who essentially crapped on a plate and handed it to the
whole country. What we ought to be offended by is the notion that her
boring-ass poem (which I would think would have pissed you off the more by
being itself so utterly devoid of craft and relying instead on a long list
of People We Ought to Include) was worth something in the first place.
Coolidge and Fagin (as was pointed out, the little saddle-stapled booklet,
down to the typefaces and such, looked almost identical to that in which
the Angelou poem was published) merely held up the mirror to the great
icon standing there with her platter of crap.

Dear Marcus and others:

I found (by accident) that n+7 poems are a wonderful teaching method.  I
had a group of students doing substitutions
one day years ago, when one of them said it was difficult because they'd
been punished in school by being forced
to look up words in the dictionary.

This exercise cured them.  "Look at THIS word!" they kept saying to each
other.  Happens every time.  Great method.

aloha, Susan

If we are algorithms, they're algorithms that will always be too difficult
for mere algorithms like us to figure out.

i don't share marcus's perspective on the random and algorithms in writing
and art, but he raises some interesting issues. i sent his post to someone i
know who is considering doing a doctoral thesis on randomness in art.

i can remember having a perspective very similar to marcus's concerning
randomness and algorithms.

i wonder if anyone knows of any insightful books that addresses the sorts of
issues marcus raises?

i thought about responding to marcus's post but it seems like a lot of work
to do it well.

it wasn't really until i started to experiment myself with the random in art
that i realized it can be erm magical. and not only magical, but it offers
perspectives on the material of writing or radio that can be quite useful
regardless of one's perspectives on the efficacy of random methods. it gives
one a different perspective on one's own work, for instance. so that we can
begin to be a bit more objective about our own writing, see it from other
points of view where our intentions are less precious and the words we've
written and their dynamics perhaps more or differently evident. it can also
open up the notion of voice, for instance, into undiscovered areas.

and it is a kind of portal into another force or power operating on the
writing apart from one's own intentions. as though one lets a mysterious
part of the universe into the writing process.

so Jacquard Mace Lower, Joint Cain, the Ouster pepsin, the surtaxes,
daguerrotype, i.e. the corked of twiddle cereal expletive pois are all scowls
and concave menarches? Come on, Margrave, you seem to have missed a
whole cereal in poi.

Here is an N+7 substitution for your original, and thus I refute your assertion
that any N+7 substitution is great art that reveals the essential nonsense of
the original. Say, no wonder you postmodernists like this kind of thing -- it's so
easy! No thinking, no art, no work involved. Just look things up in the
dictionary! Real class, that.

What are you going to do, Pierre, write 4'34"? Maybe 4'35" as a topper?

Yes, Jackson Mac Low, John Cage, the Oulipo people, the surrealists, Dada,
the whole core of 20th century experimental poets are all scoundrels and con
men. They are laughing up their sleeves at the extraordinary ease that your
bourgeois M. Joudainist gullibility fell for their Tartuffian schemes: why, you've
been speaking Poetry all this time!

You're saying the point is that since you can get equal ridiculousness by N+7
substitutions for ANY poem, that therefore by using N+7 substitutions to mock
Angelou's poem means you have done something significant or important or
even interesting? That's like claiming that your bowel movement was
signifricant or important or interesting on the grounds that since everyone has
bowel movements yours are particularly interesting. It's not only nonsense, it's
nonsense on stilts.

The only way "pumice of morons" or "lower than the angiosperm" would be
interesting, significant, or important would be if someone thought them up as
ways to mock Angelou's poem -- but no one thought them up. They are the
result of an N+7 mechanical process and are, therefore, even more
meaninglessly trite (however trite you may think it) because at least Angelou
was writing her own stuff. It took two postmodernists to look words up in the
dictionary (it took two! postmodernists must be in even sadder shape than I
thought) were merely looking words up in the dictionary and substituting them
in someone else's original work. There's nothing significant, important, or even
interesting in that -- anyone, well, okay, if it's postmodernists, any two can do
it. Anything that anyone, or even any two (allowing postmodernists their
handicap), can do can't be, by definition, significant or important.

The claim that looking words up in the dictionary is a significant artistic act is
paradigmatic of the aesthetic bankruptcy of the postmodern worldview. The
sadder thing is that that may be the very best that postmodernists can do.

So, an interesting, significant, or important critique of crap is to provide more
and bigger crap? By that standard, which seems to be the standard of
postmodernists everywhere, it's a race to the bottom of the art endeavor: who
can do the most bad work the worst? It's not merely wrong-headed, it's
pathetic.

Sturgeon's Law applies to poetry as well as to everything else -- 90% of
everything, even poetry, is crap. But one does not better distinguish the crap
from the valuable by producing more and worse crap as fast as one can. It's
the fundamental fallacy of the entire postmodern world view that by practicing
to do more worse crap faster that one will thereby produce something
valuable. Postmodernism is among the 90% of the crappy world views. Get
over it. Look for something better.

Right on, Marcus -- this is brill!  I specially like "the corked of twiddle
cereal expletive pois," where the first phrase seems to have an intertextual
resonance with Jack Sheppard indulging in a jorrum of diddle in Newgate, the
evening before he was sent to morris at the nubbing cheat before the
hundreds of Drury, a.k.a. the hoy polloy, who no doubt had their expletives
deleted for the occasion.

Marcus,

You determined that because "pumice of morons" was arrived at through chance methods, rather than someone "thinking them up" like Angelou (as you state below), the results are not significant.   This type of elementary attack against exploratory poetics recurs on occasion here, but your gross characterizations and belligerent accusations of "crap" ultimately mire any merit your posts might have in useless defensiveness and your anger, rather than furthering constructive discussion.

The purpose of the list is not to repeatedly defend why innovative techniques exist as there are other forums for those general discussions.  Please note:

"The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion          of poetry or for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform,          and extend those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,          renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the questioning          of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the otherwise unimagined,          untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible. While we recognize that          other lists may sponsor other possibilities for exchange, we request that          those participating in this forum keep in mind the specialized and focused          nature of this project and respect our decision to operate a moderated          list. The Poetics List exists to support and encourage divergent points          of view on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics,          and we are committed to do what is necessary to preserve this space for          such
 dialog."

The only way "pumice of morons" or "lower than the angiosperm" would be interesting, significant, or important would be if someone thought them up as ways to mock Angelou's poem -- but no one thought them up. They are the result of an N+7 mechanical process and are, therefore, even more meaninglessly trite (however trite you may think it) because at least Angelou was writing her own stuff.

Thanks for passing this on Barry. I may have to write about it more.
Did Hilary mean the "you" as a negative thing, something she =20
disagrees with (that the 'inexperienced' Obama does, for instance), =20
or did she mean it as a self-characterization? As something "one" does?

I don't see why being attentive to randomness should be regarded as a disregard of craft. One chooses, assembles, & no matter how seemingly random, things take on some sort of shape.  DA DA started to hint strongly towards the often violent dis locations that would shape modernity. so why not involve our friend the machine?

Jim Andrews <jim@VISPO.COM> wrote: i don't share marcus's perspective on the random and algorithms in writing
and art, but he raises some interesting issues. i sent his post to someone i
know who is considering doing a doctoral thesis on randomness in art.

i can remember having a perspective very similar to marcus's concerning
randomness and algorithms.

i wonder if anyone knows of any insightful books that addresses the sorts of
issues marcus raises?

i thought about responding to marcus's post but it seems like a lot of work
to do it well.

it wasn't really until i started to experiment myself with the random in art
that i realized it can be erm magical. and not only magical, but it offers
perspectives on the material of writing or radio that can be quite useful
regardless of one's perspectives on the efficacy of random methods. it gives
one a different perspective on one's own work, for instance. so that we can
begin to be a bit more objective about our own writing, see it from other
points of view where our intentions are less precious and the words we've
written and their dynamics perhaps more or differently evident. it can also
open up the notion of voice, for instance, into undiscovered areas.

and it is a kind of portal into another force or power operating on the
writing apart from one's own intentions. as though one lets a mysterious
part of the universe into the writing process.

Marcus,



While I agree with you that N+7 has little chance of producing 'artistic'
results,

I would not dismiss the possibility that it might do so-especially with
small

samples of text, perhaps run through several different dictionaries (some of
which

might yield interesting results for various samples). I don't necessarily
agree that

randomness has no place in creativity-a position you seem to take; rhyme and
meter,

certainly, have rather arbitrary roots. Orthography, too-especially in
English!-has

an arbitrary quality (I don't mean here to confuse the arbitrary with the
random, but

in many cases, such as the one I will offer, the distinction means little).
I would like to

know your response to an anagrammatic form I invented ten years ago,
examples of which

appear on the Beard of Bees web site at
http://www.beardofbees.com/zimmerman.html.

By constructing 4x4 word squares, running them through an online anagram
generator

(which produced thousands of lines of words using the same 16 letters),
selecting those

that seem grammatically and otherwise interesting, and combining some of
them, I have

created a form that requires many of the same kinds of decisions that
traditional poetic

composition involves. Also, the form invites others to run the word squares
through

the anagram generator, select other (or even the same) lines, and create a
sibling or

Isotope poem, perhaps 'better' than my original. I don't write  many poems
in this form

(nor do I write sestinas), but I regard the form as at least as legitimate
as other forms

(including the sestina, which shares some of the difficulty of writing an
Isotope; try one

yourself if you don't believe me).



~ Dan

(the best "Inauguration" piece i know of is Burroughs's "Roosevelt After
Inauguration"  The "Commissioner of Sewers" is also highly recommended--the
latter is available at you tube)


Andre Breton stated at one point in Surrealism's development that the
perfect Surrealist act would be to go into a crowd with a revolver  and
begin firing at random

(when Goering and others embraced the phrase, taken from a stage play,"When
I hear the word "culture" i reach for my revolver" this put a different
angle on the proposition and Breton later with drew it--

For in words there are consequences--

yet consider this:

"Targeted assassination" a war crime, is "made" in a way similar to that of
the approach Marcus writes of--considerable work, planning, "revising,"
"craft" and "intelligence" goes into this--
yet at the same time that it occurs there is the random--the people close
by--(One is after all firing missiles into the world's most densely
populated area)--are killed or wounded, buildings and other vehicles are
damaged, and the psychological effect of terror is inflicted on the
population--
(studies of the children of Gaza have found for example that close to 90%
already have Post Traumatic Stress Disorders--in Iraq, Afghanistan, Congo,
Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan the number of very young children traumatized by wars
as soldiers and victims both creates a "future" in large part destroyed well
before its arrival--a continual trauma ready to explode at any moment over
and over again--)

To combine the chosen and worked at, planned and crafted with the random
creates a "collective punishment"--a war crime

The change in Breton's view on this particular example of randomness and its
effects, consequences, even and especially when "planned"--reveals the
madness--

All the same random shootings in crowded areas have turned from being
Surrealists acts into "the daily news"--

When there are outbreaks of what seem "random events" this causes the search
for "connections," "patterns of behaviours," and "means to identify the
symptoms ahead of time"--
which "push the envelope" of "acceptable" and "unacceptable methods" for
doing so--

In working for a very long long time with chance, found, random materials, i
have the sense often that there develops a "synchronicity" with which one is
working--

things found seem to be "just what i needed"  (NOT "what i wanted")--
they seem to fall into place--or to open the way where there had been the
possibility of a cul-de-sac--

it's this area which i think is related with what Jim writes of as
"magic"--and the sense of "something other" working with one--making
suggestions, suddenly appearing--"collaborating"--participating" with one
and the materials--
an encounter of oneself and the materials which enters into an areas of
"collaboration" not unlike that of Burroughs and Gysin's working together
which resulted in The Third Mind--

one can achieve the Third Mind by oneself also and the materials also, as
Burroughs himself showed--

working with the found for me is the opening into what is hidden in plain
site/sight/cite
I've never had any interest in "programmed chance operations" or using
systems to "find chance" or the random--

("programming chance" seems too controlled--)

these things are "already t/here" all around one--
even in lock-in, barely any thing of"interest" in a blank space under too
bright light--one finds things going on, to work with--

working with the found around one where on is at that moment is a way of
opening awareness with the arrangements already existing in the randomness
of being--
which at the same time humans for ever have found patterns, meanings,
visions, "a sense of purpose/direction/fate" in--

it is the areas where it is indeterminate that one moves--where the random
and the pattern are co-existing, not yet separated, sorted out, defined--


the one person whom i  have read on this that is very good --for a writer
and visual/sound/writing artist, including tape recordings, films, etc)--is
William S. Burroughs--In pieces included in the Word Virus collection, The
Job, The Third Mind and scattered through out  interviews and many other
works--

Picasso said--"I do not seek, I find"--
of course one could say that Burroughs, Picasso and myself all developed
methods that issued  from and worked with the found--

so there is in a sense a "method"--of one's own that one arrives at through
time--yet it can be changed simply by coming across something which suddenly
reveals something "new" and "unknown" and at the same time--strangely
familiar--The Uncanny--

which will confront one with what i call "necessity, the motherfucker of
invention"-because the methods one used suddenly are not immediately
applicable and one has "come up with something else"--which emerges from the
possibilities within the limits of the materials--

in a sense, working with the found, one is an "attarctor' for the kinds of
things which seem to be "passing through one's mind" at the moment--some
theme--some floating desire or fascination which the oddly reappearing
examples of a certain word or type of sidewalk crack, the way a leaf fell
and its shadows outlined a space in which there are "things never before
seen yet here al the time"--open out--

a great deal of thinking and work is set up so that one is most often going
to see what one set out to see--
even in "seeking" there is a desired to goal to "arrive at"--

so "programming chance" to me--this is just myself personally--too much like
"seeking the random" rather than finding it--already all around one--

so i think that even working with the found--what it is that is found in a
sense is responding with and calling out to--something which is within one
in some way uncannily recognized back and forth among the things the
sites/sights/cites , the events, and the person--

at a certain level it is an acceptance of the simultaneous randomness and
"serendipity" as the poet  Larry Eigner called it, in al that is going on
around one--

the more one develops an awareness within this, the less there is an
"intentionality" or a planned randomness--a method of "generating
randomness"--

the more one voyages into these areas, the more such questions of things
like "plots" and "plot less" become intertwined--allowing for ever more
"viewpoints" "angles'--and a sense of the reversibility and doubling,
mirroring, "simulating," camouflaging and dis-and-re-appearing aspects of
the neg entropy going on continually  "making itself available to be
found"--

The Pre_Socratics have many interesting writings on this interplay among the
random and the "destined" so to speak--
Heraclitus:  The most beautiful world is heap of rubble tossed down at
random.

Three other books of great interest and use i can think of are Hans Richter
Dada  Art and Anti-Art, The Writings of Robert Smithson and Rudolf Arnheim's
Art and Entropy and parts of Order Out of Chaos by Stengers and Prigogine
though in a sense they "explain" what is "hidden in plain site/sight/cite"
continually--

We aren't, and there are a couple of great books on the subject. If you haven't got the patience to wade through Heidegger's "Being and Time" then the more readable, fun, and interesting version of the story can be found in Hubert Dreyfus's "What Computers Can't Do."

aleatory is a paintbrush. like any other paintbrush it's suited to certain jobs better than others. i think it would be a little bit short sighted for a painter to say "I'm never ever going to splatter paint on a canvas" although one notes that most perfectly good and interesting painters go whole careers without using the technique, while others find lots of interesting ways of using it, and still more overfocus on it to the point of silliness.

same thing with Aleatory in poetry.

This reminded me of possibly the best lyrical poem to emerge from the US post-punk movement in the early eighties. I won't bore everyone who doesn't share my belief that poetry is by and large alive and well and living in pop music, but I will link you to a performance of it if you're curious: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzMu6ugTNfA

David,

"Not what one wants" but what one needs. I think you hit exactly on the
serendipitous mystery of discovering what one needs. That way the randomness
of one's surrounding gains shape, which seems itself to be no shape at all
(possibly an aura, what holds electrons together. I am thinking of Joseph
Cornell's constructions.

David, how much walking (the original flaneur of urban life, later perhaps
the trash collector, the clochard) become the method implicit in the
madness. Aren't't perhaps digressions the core of random thinking for us?

Great post.

Murat

Jim,

"and it is a kind of portal into another force or power operating on the
writing apart from one's own intentions. as though one lets a mysterious
part of the universe into the writing process."

Randomness has something to do, it seems to me, with the disintegration,
destruction of the ego, which is an essential concept both in Sufism and
perhaps Buddhism. In Sufism, this loss of ego (which , specifically in
poetry, leads to Eda, a transformation in the concept of the lyric "I")
opens up the spirit to divine consciousness.

Ciao,

Murat

I would think her words meant something like:  You (one) can (or might) =
campaign in poetry, but you (one) must govern in prose.  And yes, surely =
she was referring to Obama - to be more specific and clear.

Not very raucous really, despite a couple moments where all four =

There is no proof, and probably never will be, that there are any thought
processes of which humans are capable and computers are not.

There are things that computers can't do. But there is no proof that humans
can do them either.

Turing devised the Turing machine (though he didn't call them Turing
machines), which is a mathematical construct, not a material machine, as a
means to show that there are some tasks that no algorithm can accomplish.
More particularly, he showed that there cannot exist any algorithm of the
type requested by David Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem ).

In other words, Turing invented computers somewhat incidentally; he invented
them as a theoretical means to solve the Entscheidungsproblem, which was one
of the outstanding mathematical problems of its day. And it's rather
delicious that he invented the Turing machine to show that there are some
things that algorithms cannot accomplish. Computers were invented
incidentally as a means to show there are some things computers can't do.

So we have known from the very start of the theory of computation that there
are some things that computers/algorithms cannot accomplish.

But there is absolutely no proof that humans can do any of these things
either.

There are many claims to the contrary, but to date, they are all fallacious.
It would be front page news if Computer Scientists verified any of these
claims. Because it would mean that the human mind is truly more advanced
than any computer will ever be, can ever be. Many people really want to
believe this is true. But I think it unlikely. Which doesn't make us any
less marvelous than we truly are.

It takes a very simple algorithm to make very complex and unpredictable
patterns. Though actually, I wasn't thinking of computers at all, but of the
biological processes that, for example, lead to spots on cows.

Murat,

Journalists try not to write themselves into the story. That is a kind of
destruction of the ego, at least in the piece itself, in the sense that they
or their editors edit out/destroy any personal reference. This is not what
you're talking about, I realize, but it nonetheless is a sort of
"disintegration, destruction of the ego". Or perhaps more typically a
veiling of the ego.

In William S. Burroughs's trilogy of cutup novels (The Ticket that Exploded,
Nova Express, and The Soft Machine), one of the effects of the cutup is
indeed a disintegration or destruction of the distinction between the
characters, sometimes. You can see how this might work. The reference is
unclear, often, because of the cutup (and Burroughs's decision to go with it
and shape it) as to whether this or that character is being referred to. So
that, in a sense, the cutup merges the characters into one character. It's a
rather cosmic thing. Or so it seemed at the time I read it! Brilliant!

Whether one is a journalist or a novelist or a painter or poet or whatever,
we realize it isn't really about us. Our work attempts to be involved with
and to involve others and ideas, as well as the 'beyond us' in another
sense, whether a religious sense or whatever one's notion is of what is
beyond us, ourselves, what is powerful and at work in things, in us, in the
world, in the cosmos.

And random methods can be useful in this regard. Burroughs felt that to get
beyond one's wee self and habits, limitations, acknowleged and unacknowleged
intentions, the cutup was useful. And so it is in his work.

He was one of the more interesting writers about the poetics of the random.
I gather John Cage is another. And undoubtedly some of the Oulipo poets.

The book of Burroughs I'm familiar with where he talks about this sort of
thing is The Job, which I found fascinating. What are some of the other
books by others where the poetics of the random is written about
insightfully?

Here are some pieces and tools on vispo.com that involve the random. There
are many other pieces on the site that use the random() function, but it
isn't a focus of the piece. Often I use it simply to provide a bit of range
in the behavior and a selection is made among similar things. But the random
plays a different role in the below pieces, is more central. Or, in the case
of the stir fry texts, there isn't any use of the random() function but its
very combinatorial.

that a good sestina may be written using six words randomly chosen.  But t=

sestina is a piece of art, if it turns out to be one instead of a mere exe=

The production of `artistic=B4 results for N+7 after a human, using small =

N+7 and other such algorithms will make the same kind of hash out of ANY

It seems that in the discussion of the n+7 constraint, the role of mathemat=
ics in OuLiPo has been forgotten. The majority of the readers of this list =
already know the following, but this is for Marcus: there is nothing random=
 about the method. OuLiPians abhorred the randomness of the Surrealists and=
 Dada (see the introduction to the Oulipo Compendium, edited by Harry Mathe=
ws). What they sought was to instill a mathematical rigor and consistency t=
o their study and writing of mathematics. What the n+7 method reveals (beca=
use there is a scientific hypothesis to what the Oulipians did) is how synt=
ax and meaning have a relationship, based on certain social conditions (her=
e, the dictionary).=0A=0AAgain, here is the explanation of the method from =
the Oulipo Compendium:=0A=0AN+7 (S+7). A method invented by Jean Lescure th=
at "consists" (in Queneau's terse definition) "in replacing each noun (N) w=
ith the seventh following it in a dictionary."=0ABefore beginning the opera=
tion, it is obviously necessary to choose a text and a dictionary. (...) Wh=

American context, the word-results are going to differ on the choice betwee=
n a more "progressive" dictionary like the American Heritage and a more "co=
nservative" one like the OED (not quite sure why I am putting quotation mar=

to write something original. Rather, it seeks to study the rules of languag=

Marcus' posts, before today, were riddled with name-calling, among other insults, and an anger against the poetics many list members engage in.  That kind of anger reminds me of the historical problems the Poetics List has experienced, especially before the list was moderated.

Such attacks have sufficiently silenced members in the past, and so, my post was a reminder of  the supportive aim of the Poetics List, most especially, "The Poetics List exists to support and encourage divergent points          of view on innovative forms of modern and contemporary poetry and poetics,          and we are committed to do what is necessary to preserve this space for          such dialog."

Anyone can challenge the very existence of these poetics, but I am certain that since most members engage in these practices, he can do so respectfully and with civility.

Does this mean that each subsequent N+7 endeavor lacks originality?

I would say there a whole lot more --not to take issue with Fran=E7ois, sin=
ce
the paraphrasal was mentioned-- involved in the method than just which
dictionary you grab. Namely, the text you choose to N+7. Fagin and Coolidge
chose Angelou's for a reason. I suspect it mostly had to do with the fact o=
f
what they knew: that Angelou was treating language as a marker of
distinction; that I speak and you listen to me because of who I am, not wha=
t
I'm saying. They found (I assume) the idea preposterous. It's a resting on
one's linguistic (not to mention, societal) laurels. The text On the Pulse
of Morning -- granted, in my humble opinion -- is a reminder that
intelligent people can become lazy (and cheesy, sentimental, etc) when they
assume their every word is received with epic weight.

N+7 really functions as a teaching mode (again, imho) when students learn
exactly what is changed when syntax and meaning are altered. Some words
don't change a sentence's "weight" all that much, and they then attempt to
resolve why that is...

There had been, of course, no rigor or consistency to the study and writin=

mathematics prior to 1960, so thank god for the oulipians, eh?

There is no scientific hypothesis to what the Oulipians did -- there is a =
social
hypothesis, but no scientific one. Science is a different endeavor from ar=
t
primarily because one cannot make a testable hypothesis and a replicable
experiment that predicts how artists are going to act in any specific enou=
gh
way to be meaningful under any particular set of circumstances. Artists do=
 not
orbit the sun or the like -- their acts are volitional, not mechanistic. P=
seudo-
science using scientific-sounding words, which are almost always in
postmodernist practice either misunderstood or simply used wrong, is not t=
he
same as science.

Yes, yes, we all know what the N+7 method is. But it's still a claim that =
by
replacing nouns with the 7th following them in the dictionary one can crea=
te a
piece of art mechanically, without human choices in the process. Gwyn's cl=
aim
went even further -- she claimed that the N+7 process was an effective par=
ody
or spoof of a particular poem. My point is that that cannot be true even i=
f you
accept N+7 as a valid artistic procedure because the N+7 method makes a
hash of ANY poem, not just bad poems. There is nothing in the N+7 method
that distinguishes between good and bad poems and makes good poems
better and bad poems worse. The method treats all poems the same, and
equally makes a hash of good ones and bad ones.

Studying the rules of language and seeking not to be enslaved by them
doesn't sound like much of an aesthetic manifesto, does it. As a pedagogic=
al
tool (as someone has posted) to get kids to use the dictionary and become
more interested in language and words, the N+7 method has obvious merit --=

but its merit consists in comparing how words work within a grammar, and n=
ot
in creating a new piece of art. As a philosophical experiment to examine h=
ow
dictionaries work, or how language works, the N+7 method may have merit,
too -- but, once again, it's not the merit of creating new works of art.

Coming up with a poem on your own is a different kind of endeavor from
coming up with a procedure on your own, unless you're saying that the N+7
claim is that the procedure will always produce a work of art by mechanica=
l
application of its mechanistic process. Are you really saying that?

If you're not, then writing a poem and initiating a procedure for examinin=
g
language are different endeavors. Lescure's creativity in philosophy is di=
fferent
from Angelou's creativity in poetry -- even if you claim, as it appears yo=
u do,
that Lescure's work compared to his philosophical colleagues' work is supe=
rior
in a way that Angelou's work compared to her poetic colleagues' work is no=
t.

In order to make the point you seem to be trying to make, that Oulipian wo=
rks
using the N+7 method are works of art in and of themselves as a result not=
 of
any human choices, but rather by mechanistic reference to a particular boo=
k,
then any book-code must also be a work of art. That might also mean that a=
ny
code is a work of art. Do you claim either of those?

I reject the notion that any algorithm is going to produce a work of art. =
I do not
reject the notion that algorithms are useful for any number of other sorts=
 of
endeavor. I do not reject the notion that algorithms can be used heuristic=
ally to
jump-start the human creative process. But I do emphatically reject the no=

First, I assert that there is no such thing as "divine consciousness". The=
re is
no god, of any sort. I think the feeling that is described as, for example=
, "divind
consciousness" or "afflatus", among others, is merely a psychological stat=
e. It
has no connection to any sort of divinity because there is no such thing a=
s any
kind of divinity.

Second, the notion of destruction of ego seems to me to absolutely elimina=
te
the possibility of any art whatever. It is human striving that creates art=
, and to
eliminate one's humanity in the service of becoming so unaware, so
unconscious, that one lives entirely in the moment, like an animal, must o=
f
necessity eliminate any capacity for making art. I suppose I must leave op=
en
the possibility that such a striving to eliminate one's humanity is in and=
 of itself
an art, the artifact of which is an animal that outwardly resembles a huma=
n
being but which has, by art, sacrificed its humanity on the altar of the p=
rocess,
and is no longer capable of either art or humanity.

I reject the entire notion of spirituality whole. Human beings create thei=
r own
meaning within an experience of the external world that is only a partiall=
y
accurate recreation of that external world internally. There is no meaning=

either external or internal to a human being that a human being does not
create -- but there is an external world which each human being experience=
s
more or less accurately depending on the various cultures he or she has be=
en
brought up and lives in. That external world is spectacularly unforgiving,=
 and
often dangerous, which means that human beings have come up with a wide
range of explanations for why what happens happens.

Among the failed explanations are all sorts of divinity stories. The unive=
rse, as
JBS Haldane observed, is not only queerer than we imagine, it is queerer t=
han
we can imagine. Human beings will simply never understand it all, but some=

explanations are more successful than others, and we should at least pursu=
e
those explanations that are more successful, and abandon those that are no=
t.

So it seems to me that since randomness is generally as unsuccessful, all =
by
itself, as any divinity story, it is unwise to privilege randomness with a=
ny sort of
sublime effects that approximate or replicate divinity stories. Not one of=
 you is
really serious about randomness in your lives, or you'd never survive. If =
you
really believed in randomness as a path to divinity you'd eat, for example=
,
randomly -- not only with respect to time but with respect to what you put=
 in
your mouth. You'd pee when you needed to and shit when you pleased,
irrespective of any social conventions, which any devotee of randomness
must regard as trivial nonsense. Since by the fact that you are successful=

enough at western-style living to be subscribed to this list you are clear=
ly not
devotees of randomness, why theorize about how randomness might make
art, when following randomness in life is so obviously a bad idea?

Dear All,

A list of things I've learned since last week, framed as 3 parts actual, 2
parts lunacy ---

- That the dual equality operator ( === ) is only relevant in object
oriented ((socially) progressive) programming methodology.
- How to escape from writing static web pages in PHP, for Ruby, and Ruby on
Rails.
- How to make use of the fact that one plus one equals two.
- How to make use of things that don't work if you need them to work.

And more, on my blog: http://denacht.blogspot.com.

All the best,

Jesse

In what way is the argument on behalf N+7 creating art different from a
monkey writing Hamlet (or a "critique" of it) given a typewrter and enough
paper and time? One has to still locate "the Hamlet" among infnite numbers
of paper (maybe a Boges library made up of pages typed by a compulsive
obsessive monkey). I think that infinite endlessness of a seductively easy
method (which may even appear like a revelation) that Marcus is reacting to=

Marcus,

Your responses to my arguments are so packed with pithy assertions that it
almost hurts me to unpack them, besides the fact that  it may take me for
more than a week. Therefere, I will only gently touch a few of your
assertions:

a) > Randomness has something to do, it seems to me, with the
> disintegration, destruction of the ego, which is an essential concept
> both in Sufism and perhaps Buddhism. In Sufism, this loss of ego (which ,
> specifically in poetry, leads to Eda, a transformation in the concept of
the
> lyric "I") opens up the spirit to divine consciousness.<

First, I assert that there is no such thing as "divine consciousness". Ther=
e
is
no god, of any sort. I think the feeling that is described as, for example,
"divind
consciousness" or "afflatus", among others, is merely a psychological state=
.
It
has no connection to any sort of divinity because there is no such thing as
any
kind of divinity.

"Divine consciousness" exists because it exists as a concept in Sufism. Do
you mean that I made this whole assersion about Sufism up or only that the
concept itself is an illusion? If it is the latter, is "a psychological
state" then not merely a concept but something more? How is "a psychologica=
l
state" more real than "divine consciousness"?

By your argument there is "a psychological state" but no "divinity"? How ar=
e
they different? Pray explain.

b) "Second, the notion of destruction of ego seems to me to absolutely
eliminate
the possibility of any art whatever. It is human striving that creates art,
and to
eliminate one's humanity in the service of becoming so unaware, so
unconscious, that one lives entirely in the moment, like an animal, must of
necessity eliminate any capacity for making art. I suppose I must leave ope=
n
the possibility that such a striving to eliminate one's humanity is in and
of itself
an art, the artifact of which is an animal that outwardly resembles a human
being but which has, by art, sacrificed its humanity on the altar of the
process,
and is no longer capable of either art or humanity."

How did you come out with the definition "it is human striving which create=
s
art"? To expand on one of your metaphors, human striving might also be a
solution to constipation, but is it art under the circumstances? Does it
mean that if a poem is written easily, it is not an artistic poem? Or do yo=
u
mean that the subject of art should be about aspiring to something superior
or out of ordinary, provided that abject is not divine; but it can be about
a psychological state?

How come you equate "living entirely in the moment" with being unconscious
or being like an animal? Do you mean that a poem like Andrew Marvell's "To
His Coy Mistress" might as well have been written by an animal, devoid of
wit or consciousness?

Come to think of it, do animals live in the moment? Does one need language
to say that? When we say an animal does not think of  or know its death, do
we not mean it has no language in relation to us? Doesn't being "conscious
of one's death" by necessity imply the consciousness of deathlessness -in
other words divinity- whether such a thing exists or not?

It is 2:20 A.M. I have to go to bed. I will leave it here.

Ciao,

Murat

i presume (correct me if i'm wrong) you mean that magic and random methods
are notions at odds with one another. a sort of einsteinian position--he
said 'god does not play dice'. whereas heraclitus said 'time is a child
playing at dice. the kingdom is a child's.'

no, not really. in part it's a way of letting something other than me into
the writing process. in a way that sometimes is more interesting than what
was there or is sometimes a way to experience the writing afresh or a way to
see how the language works at the level of the phrase (cutups seem to stress
the phrase) or a way to ponder it or experience it from a different
perspective.

and other people who use random methods will have different reasons and
approaches. just like different people will use the same brush differently.

there's a type of art called 'generative art'. it needn't involve computers,
but these days often it does. part of the idea of computer-based--or perhaps
also other types of generative art--is to create algorithms interesting and
rich enough that they do indeed either create art on their own or they do so
with some sort of interaction with people.

i'm working on a generative art piece at the mo called dbcinema. it is a
program that creates images and movies. interactively. there are some
pictures at http://vispo.com/dbcinema/meditations.htm that were created by
dbCinema+me.

natural processes such as evolution have been magnificently successful in
creating the awesome diversity of amazing life on our planet. natural
process is certainly enough to create art.

Dear Jim and Murat--

Jim wrote:

Journalists try not to write themselves into the story. That is a kind of
destruction of the ego, at least in the piece itself, in the sense that they
or their editors edit out/destroy any personal reference. This is not what
you're talking about, I realize, but it nonetheless is a sort of
"disintegration, destruction of the ego". Or perhaps more typically a
veiling of the ego.

In William S. Burroughs's trilogy of cutup novels (The Ticket that Exploded,
Nova Express, and The Soft Machine), one of the effects of the cutup is
indeed a disintegration or destruction of the distinction between the
characters, sometimes. You can see how this might work. The reference is
unclear, often, because of the cutup (and Burroughs's decision to go with it

and shape it) as to whether this or that character is being referred to. So
that, in a sense, the cutup merges the characters into one character. It's a
rather cosmic thing. Or so it seemed at the time I read it! Brilliant!





Dear Jim and Murat

(Jim, i am not sure if you saw my earlier letter re Burroughs and others
from two days ago----it added "a few books" to the subject "spoofing
inaugural poems"

I think there is a misunderstanding of what Burroughs is doing with the
cutups and also with this idea of the journalist.

I was a journalist myself for some years,  a self-trained one, and still do
"journalism" of the kind in newspapers now and then and. like Burroughs,
play with/on  a "mock" journalism in the creation of essays, fictions,
poems,  Burroughs i was drawn to early  as share with him the idea of the
writer as "private investigator," "journalist", ("Your intrepid reporter") a
type of secret agent".

 The writer is an "agent" whose mission is NOT to become "ego less" in the
systematized product of randomness, for this makes one all the more
passively part of the very systems of control which one has been given the
illusion of "breaking down."  The writer essays to find "fugitive"  ways of
"survival" in a system which has an immense, insatiable "algebra of need"
for Control, the flipside of the addict's "alegebra of need" for the "drug
of choice."  Control needs addicts to its never ceasing variety of "opiums
of the people, " It is "cunning, baffling and powerful" let alone ruthless
in its means of creating the availability of addictive "substances" and
"ideas" and "languages" and in maintaining its "empire," the very least of
which is "the status quo."

Burroughs' cut-ups, unlike the productions of the machines online that one
can use to do cut-ups as though "not by oneself," are methods of making a
"minority of one" which via camouflages, masks, "being obvious," essays
survival as an intact writer. "The Death of the Author" so beloved of
Authors, for this kind of writer has already been experienced near-literally
and figuratively; what remains is the desire to live, go on living as a
writer--and so the camouflages, disguises, masks, "role playing" and
heteronyms, "alter egos."

In Burrogghs' cut-ups--the cut-up uses texts to reveal  the synchronicities
and correspondences which exist among them, which in turn give evidences of
the "plot," the "conspiracy" going on and conducted by Language As Control.
The cutting up is to reveal the inner anatomy so to speak of the bodies of
the Monsters, the Mobsters of the Nova Mob and their spreading
virus-word-conspiracy.

The "consciousness"  "outside oneself," which one "lets in" via "destruction
of the ego" through randomness--on the way hand may be "cosmic, the
universe,"--"a power greater than ourselves"--of it may be Control--the Nova
Mob, Big Brother, "His Master's Voice" as was the old the RCA Victor record
label's image of the dog listening to the ginat flower of the victrola's
"speaker."

Burroughs as he noted in the Introduction to Queer--thought of himself as
being of the Middle Ages in his thinking regarding "psychology."  (He had
after all studied for a year in Vienna after graduating from Harvard.)  It
is NOT the "ego" which one wants to get away from but the forces outside one
which try to destroy one's being, take control of it and use it for their
purposes.  The writer's activity is a guerrilla one against being turned
into a passive, consenting, or unwitting accomplice in the vast complicities
with the conspiracies of  Control.

In the Introduction to the first edition of Junkie, which is reprinted in
later printings, Burroughs notes of the little glossary of street/drug terms
at the back of the book:  "Therefore a final glossary cannot be made of
words whose intentions are fugitive."

The writer is at once the detective and the outlaw--an agent "posing" inside
the imposed "seemingly random" cover of Control.  The secret agent/intrepid
reporter/private investigator/"Inspector Lee" is ceaselessly at work to
dismantle and discover, uncover, recover "evidence" to be used  not simply
for "cutting up" but--as Burroughs makes clear--arranging, editing, creating
the "Files" which make use of the juxtapositions of words, images,
memories,dreams, fictions and facts, so  as to be making an ongoing
"fugitive" language which at once perceives and deceives Control.

the writer is not attempting to become "ego-less"--but a series of
"identities" which are 'disguises" and "camouflages" such that the writer
becomes "El Hombre Invisible" as one of Burroughs' own sobriquets "pictured"
him.  The writer participates in a series of anonymous, heteronymous,
pseudonymous and invented personas" parts," "roles," "charcters."   This is
not to destroy the "identity" of the writer at the core, but to preserve the
writer in order to continue writing for writing is the means of survival in
a world in which both the "seemingly random" and the "obvious' are bent on
maintaining their control over one.

The great Jazz musician Don Cherry used to very often say--"Free Jazz can
only be played by superbly disciplined musicians."  Burroughs' years of work
with the cut ups in texts, images, sound recordings, film--this has
affinities with Rimbaud's "long reasoned derangement of the senses" in order
to arrive at the Unknown," which for Burroughs is the being always a step
ahead of the Control, of Language.  For Burroughs this to make possible not
only travel in space, but travel in time for the writer.

Burroughs was always precise on the point that no work was done when he was
using drugs.  Drugs are Control which wipes out the writer. Tabula rasa.
Having been a long term addict like Burroughs, it was only after one gets
away from that Control, that one enters writing--and why writing is very
different from  becoming "outside" to oneself--it is the means to find a way
to exist as oneself--to survive--what one knows of the Forces of Control.
It is that necessity of survival  the necessity that is the motherfucker of
invention that is involved with the fugitive, "outlaw," "outsider" aspect of
writing, the need for the "undercover" aspects, and the reason why so much
that one finds around does not appear to one as it does to others. It is too
see what is hidden in plain site/sight/cite and at the same time see how
many things that "seem" to be  "liberating" are disguised traps, or inside
out reflections of what they purport to be the opposite of, in opposition
to.  Often the concept of "opposition" itself can be used as a diversion
from what is the overall issue of Control and an essay at understanding and
recognising as much as possible its manifestations.

An aspect of this is the breaking down seemingly of voices in which Jim
notes  "all characters seem to be one."    The key is that they "seem" to be
"one."  From the point of view of the writer, they are not one, but many,
and constitute a swarm.  The swarm is camouflaged by this "seeming" to be
one--if it is simply "one" then it can be easily crushed.  The multiple
"identities" of the writer creates such a swarm, a way of continually being
"a minority of one" "on the move"  whose "intentions are fugitive"--a
"minority of one" whose intentions are to appear now as "one," now as
"another," and in turn as a swarm which may appear to the eyes of Control as
"one."

Kurt Schwitters is one of the truly profound "cut-up" artists--and his
collage "method" was to use what he found in the street.  Again, Picasso's
"I do not seek, I find."  This is Burroughs' method in the cut-ups--he used
the found texts of newspapers, things found in the street, passages found in
his favorite writers, in turn collaging these edited cut-ups, which he put
through many transumuttations of his own cutting and pasting by hand--and
the n arranging--along side the passages from his dream journals, and others
from the memories which were stimulated in turn by the collaged cut-ups and
dreams and fictions, poetry of other writers.  This for Burroughs
constitutes the writer's method of time travel--to be able to travel among
memory, dream, imagined places and persons, factually recorded ones known
and unknown to the writers and so create extensions of fugitive

As Burroughs writes in the Intro to Queer--writing is for him a matter of
life and death.  On the day that he shot his wife, he feels that the forces
"outside" were in Control, and the use of drugs was the allowing of Control
to reduce him to zombie sitting on the edge of his bed staring at his foot
for what was a period in which time is "junk time" only measured by the
drops from the syringe, the injected transfusions of Control.

The Carny world, the hustlers, the small time dope peddlers, snitches,
thieves, punks and assorted "low life" and "criminal" doctors, scientists
etc that populate Burroughs' universe are his verison in a sense of the
Medieval Carnival, in which the masks fall away and the Emperor really has
no clothes, Death walks nonchalantly in broad daylight, the Sins come out to
play, and the monstrous buffoons that are the forces of Order are for a day
or a few truly Buffoons.  That is the meaning of "Naked Lunch"--the title
from Kerouac's saying that it was the moment when indeed what was on the
forks was seen for what it is--not unlike the scene of The Last Supper in
Bunuel's Viridiana, the Feast of the the deformed, the degenerate, the
diseased and their having their "picture taken" by a woman facing them who
lifts her dress up to bare her "camera eye" as the "recorder" of
"posterity"  that "degrades"not only the Last Supper, but particularly its
representations.  In a sense, this method destroys not what is the Last
Supper itself but the use of its representations as methods of Control  The
woman's "camera" image "exposes" the degeneration and diseased ("Word
Virus") "state of the image" and "image of the state" as a "rotting
edifice".  (A leper--literally a "rotting one,"  plays prominent part in all
of this, including the violating of Viridiana, the former Nun now a secular
"doer of good."  Among the "rotting edifices" of the film is Franco's
Spain--this is 1961--where "miraculously Bunuel made this, one of his finest
works.)

"Look at it this way," so to speak.  A reporter does not necessarily become
"more objective" and "less present"  via self-censorship and editing, but
more representative of the point of view of the "editorial board" which in
turn is accountable to the "board of directors" and they are accountable to
the ultimate holders of the accounts--the advertisers whose payments for
Space enable the "reporting" to exist as an extension of their "ideology, "
their efforts at Control.  (Burroughs' grandfather was Ivy Lee, one of the
first great "Image Makers," who created John D. Rockefller's image and whom
Hitler was intersted in hiring.)

 This is why really good reporters are so often running afoul of the papers
who employ them, let alone governments, state espionage agencies,
authorities of al sorts whom they are "investigating" and "reporting on."
The rise of infotainment and the increasing employment of huge
corporate-state-intlligence-connected "news media" and "translators" like
teh sinister  MEMRI which controls the Ameircan media's news and
translations from the Middle East and uses disinformation, planted stories,
dis-translations regularly) are bent on destroying the actual existence of
the reporter who does not want to "lose their ego" or "their own writing" to
a bunch of special interest groups, governments, corporations, infotainments
and "think tank consortiums."

The high death toll of reporters and photo journalists, media persons, in
war times and ones engaged in trying to investigate drug cartels,
gangsterism, corporate frauds is for this reason.  The reporter will not let
go of that "minority of one" standpoint which is the necessity  of someone
actually attempting to understand and "report" what is going on, outside of
the Control as much as it is possible, which is very hard when from al sides
one is a target.

The same might be said of using machines which are produced by companies for
the production of "randomness"and "cut-ups."  Why "take them on faith," for
one's "search" to "get outside oneself?"  It might be not so much a "loss of
ego" as a "liberation" but the surrendering of "oneself" to the corporate
machine and becoming another cog in the wheel of the a mass production of
texts "reflecting" the "point of view' of that particular company's
conception of "randomness" and "cut-ups."

If one has an awareness of the "fugitive intentions" of language--for
"one's own survival"--in turn causes one makes this demand, this need for
the examination of all language, for the "fugitive intentions" of Control.
In a society which so "values" such phrases  as "the bottom line," and "the
buck stops here" (yeah right--) and prints "In God We Trust" on its money,
along with the phrase "E Pluribus Unum" which can be interpreted many ways,
not al of them "good," is not the "bottom line" to put "trust" in Trusts?
"trust me, man," says the smiling dope dealer, the used car salesperson, the
voice of the "Con Inside" inserted there from the time of birth.  Trust me
says the smiling politician--and the smiling Opponent, the Opposition.
"Trust me, believe in me, obey me, love me."

The basic idea of much of the thinking of Control is this--to get persons to
live, work and think in ways which are against their  "own best interest"
and as much as possible in the "best interests" of Control.

The mystical aspect of the found which Murat notes i wrote of a few days ago
and this is often involved in my own work.  There is also this Burroughsian
aspect of a writing which wants to live, by the means which necessity gives
it, and not, as much as this is possible, by "taking signs as wonders."

If the intention were to write an N+7, I might agree. But the intention
behind n+7 points more to an observation and critique of process. And here,
again, I'll mention Fagin and Coolidge. On the Pumice of Morons seems to be
the result of that.

I think that we need to go back a bit in order to understand the *why*
of all of these modernist workings with determinations and chance
(people were just starting to realize that they were the same thing).

I take up from Francois' last paragraph which, to my mind, is key.

Francois: "Finally, since you assert that the destruction of ego
destroys the possibility of art (again, which refers to a very
Romantic notion of art and which, by the way, did not exist before a
bunch of crazy Italian painters decided to call them Artists in the
Renaissance), what do you make of collaborative arts, like the ones
made by the Neue Slowenische Kunst, in theater, in comic books or in
cinema?"

 As I understand it after both WWI (the surrealist movement) and WWII
(its return) people felt a need to rethink human subjectivity itself.
One's "natural" innards had proved to be incredibly destructive and it
was thought that this architectural/process based writing would break
people out of their romantic complacencies. One should not look for
Romantic era beauty in examining these pieces of art then, but some
sort of newness and jolt.

It is quite possible that we are no longer jolted anymore--not by the
things that come out of those particular architectures--and given the
way that these techniques have been absorbed by advertising. The
question that is more interesting to me than whether the old art is
the same thing as the new art, is what kind of art now.

And, perhaps, jolting is no longer what we need now--speaking for
myself I get enough in everyday llife, but what about something like
connecting (see Spahr's book Everybody's Autonomy on connective
reading).

In this era of credit/debt and the speculative human it seems to me
that art is useful for appointing, collating and re-synchronizing our
personhoods with our labour. The architectural techniques of the
Ouilipo might be quite useful if we turn them to that synchronizing
purpose. See Duchamp's piece, Dust Breeding but also the more well
known "ready-mades" which were made by setting a date and a time for
the rendez(vous)es

Dear Friends:

I am heading to India to Bollywood and the Kolkata
Book Fair. As most of you know, Rattapallax is one of
the main sponsors of the US Delegation to the 2008
Kolkata Book Fair (Jan. 30 to Feb. 10) -- the largest
book fair in the world with an annual attendance of
2.8 million people.

We have a remarkable group of poets, writers, editors,
translators and publisher going with us. The
delegation is YUSEF KOMUNYAKAA, BHARATI MUKHERJEE,
CAROLYN FORCHE, BOB HOLMAN, JOY HARJO, CHRISTOPHER
MERRILL, NATHALIE HANDAL, ED PAVLIC, GOUTAM DATA, RAM
DEVINENI, CATHERINE FLETCHER,  DANTE MICHEAUX, and
IDRA NOVEY.

With the support of CLMP, we gathered and shipped over
10,000 books to be sold and displayed at the book
fair. They represent the diversity of independent
literary publishing in the USA. Special thanks to the
National Endowment for the Arts and Wyeth, Inc for
funding some of the delegation costs. More information
at http://www.uskle.org


I am also going to Mumbai (Bombay) with Frantisek
Ballerini, a reporter with two of Brazil’s largest
newspapers, “O Estado de S.Paulo” and “Jornal da
Tarde”, (http://www.estado.com.br) which have about
one million readers per day. The newspapers are doing
a special focus on the Indian film industry.  This
will be the first time that a Brazilian newspaper is
dedicating an entire week to Indian entertainment. We
plan to attend the Pune Film Festival, Kishore Namith
Kapoor Acting Studio, Whistling Woods Film School,
Mukta Arts Studios, YashRaj and Adlabs studios. We
will be interviewing leading Indian actors, producers,
directors, music directors, and industry leaders like
Amit Khanna, President of Film & Television Producers
Guild of India and head of Reliance entertainment, and
producer Mahesh Bhatt. The articles will correspond
with the 2nd Annual Bollywood and Indian Film Festival
at Cinemateca (Sao Paulo) in February 2008. More
information at http://www.bollywoodbrasil.com

Cheers
Ram Devineni
Producer & Publisher

Please send future emails to
devineni@rattapallax.com for press

The idea that computers are capable of thought processes at all is mistaken. Computers are capable of changing the states of switches from on to off based on control voltages. because you can pretend that off means zero and on means 1, and because that's enough numerals to represent any number you want to represent, then you can do all kinds of math with them. and because you can pretend that zero means False and 1 means True, you can also construct truth trees and perform logical operations with them.

but it's still just switches turning on and off. To the computer, they don't mean anything.

People on the other hand, live in the world. Parts of our bodies might work in ways that are analagous to the switches in computers, but they aren't the same, and no matter how you push the metaphor it will always remain figurative rather than literal similarity.

Which is not to say that artificial intelligence is impossible, it's just that you're never going to get there by pretending a mind is an algorithm.

I disagree. I can do all sorts of things a computer can't do:

I can get angry
I can appreciate a sunset
I can be afraid of being stung by a wasp
I can sing a song I half remember and make up the rest to suit my mood
I can guess about what you mean if you are saying something that isn't clear
I can translate poetry from French into English
I can choose John Edwards as my favorite candidate for president.
I can pass a turing test
I can fall in love
I can appreciate the value of a dollar
I can day dream
I can hold an opinion
I can have a nightmare
I can get hungry and thirsty
I can be alone in a crowded room
I can confront the universe and be frustrated by its refusal to confront me back
I can take a stand on my own existence

A computer can be made to seem like it is doing any of those things, but it's no more doing them than those programs I used to write in BASIC during computer class in the seventh grade were really calling the kid next to me a Jerkoff. Anything it did, and anything any computer ever does because of an algorithm, will only ever happen because some other kind of being who could do those things that I can also do told it to do that thing. In this way a computer is just a really complicated hammer and unless they can someday do something other than follow rules and heuristics and fake randomness, that's all they'll ever be.

An algorithm can certainly write a poem. I don't think one will ever read one.

Do you have any idea what you are talking about ?

Please don't mix Terminator II with Emily Dickinson.......

and get your facts right. It isn't the largest bookfair in the world
but the most attended and sure it is an event of great cultural and
intellectual dissemination very widely attended by practising poets
and writers of all brands and bends and that is exactly why "Bollywood",
if uttered in the same breath, tarnishes its great literary rhetoric.

Hi Jason,

contemporary computers, it's true, are somewhere around the level of the
insect, or lower, when it comes to intelligence. there are exceptions, of
course. deep blue beat kasparov at chess. and so forth.

but what contemporary computers can't do only because the programming is not
sufficiently advanced is irrelevant to their theoretical capabilities, ie,
what they *could* do, not what they do in this era.

one may note that computers don't currently do x, but that is no proof that
they are incapable of it at some future point. however, there are instances
where it has been shown that computers will *never* do y. not ever. never.
as i mentioned, turing devised the turing machine as a way to show that
there are some tasks which no machine will ever be able to do.

but it has never been convincingly shown that there exist any thought
processes of which humans are capable and computers are not.

they can make decisions. they can rewrite their own programming.

some people--or probably most people--feel that it diminishes humanity to
think that the operations of the brain are those of a machine. even if such
people are not religious, they feel that in comparison with contemporary
machines we are quite obviously vastly different and conclude, from that,
that machines are necessarily as primitive in thought as contemporary
machines are.

however, it's only a measure of how early on we are into the development of
machine intelligence that this perception can be so very widespread.

my own feeling is that we are indeed ultra sophisticated machines. this does
not negate any of our intellectual capabilities. to think that humanity
arose with no designer out of natural process is, for me, a tremendously
exciting thought--it indicates the richness of natural process over 2.5
billion years of evolution (the universe itself is only 15 billion years
old).

it also gives generative art a certain appeal to me. not out of aspiration
to be god. but out of interest in engaging in generative art that can aspire
to interesting things out of simple processes. including random processes,
randomness directed in useful directions.

Requiem


requiem for Boojum, about 13 minutes

If the left and right hands have independent repeated patterns prime to
each other, why then the cycle is right*left by which time, or a fraction
of time indicated by attention span (based on short-term memory and
defuge), right*left/[short-term memory, defuge], I have moved on (to
another register, tonality, movement or moment of sound), listener follow-
ing (if the listener is listening yet), so that the ride is imminent (in a
distant sense related to 1/1 jazz rhythm or tabla additive combinatorics)
or a moment of consciousness (moment in the sense of internal time con-
sciousness mitigated by short-term memory or long-term memory of other
times and other musics by this selfing or other selvings) which at the end
(as if the requiem is in withdrawal or unknowingly bracketed until the
unexpected finality which returns as 'perfect sense') seems natural and
sadly required, as such is required, drawn forth, by any organism, from
small cat to whale, not a rupture or a ripple by a human, or at the least,
this human, playing this guitar, a 1949 di Giorgio, in an act of homage
hardly if ever unheard.     http://www.alansondheim.org/bbj.mp3

2008 KENT LECTURE FEATURING
~MS. ANGELA DAVIS~

FREE EVENT - OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
Date:  Thursday, January 24, 2008
Time:  7:00-9:00pm
Location: Rockefeller Chapel at University of Chicago,
5850 S. Woodlawn Avenue

American social justice activist, community organizer
and professor who was associated with the Black
Panther Party (BPP) and the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Community Party.
 Her story takes America down the path of social
injustice and through the civil rights battles that
enraged America, which victimized those who voiced
opposing opinions. She draws upon her own experiences
in the early 1970s as a person who spent eighteen
months in jail and on trial, after being placed on the
FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List."  Her story is one of
false accusations, incarceration and the ultimate
vindication of justice.

You are cordially invited to hear MS. ANGELA DAVIS
address the question: "How Does Change Happen?" Ms.
Davis will address the issue of unfinished work in the
struggle for equality in America, and how to deal with
the social challenges that remain in American democracy.

Subject:      Hillary-- re: the first amendment to the constitution of the US--
              right of citizens to burn US flag
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Amendment I to the Constitution of the United States of America

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

--
I do not mean to dismiss John Edwards, Barack Obama, or any other
candidates or their candidacies by not including him in this
particular discussion -- a discussion about the first amendment and
freedom of speech as it pertains to the right of American citizens to
set the American flag aflame -- but I will forego remarking on them or
the peripheral participants too much to instead focus on one of the
top three Democrat presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton. Any
Democrat currently running would be infinitely better for the country
than his or her Republican counterpart. I welcome anyone who would
argue that this isn't the case -- that John McCain would be a better
president than Dennis Kucinich, for instance -- to do so now. The
simple reason that the Left-side is more what the country needs now
than the Right-side is that the Right-side, the Grand Old Party, has
been and is currently complicit in the Bush administration's egregious
affronts to the constitution and basic human rights. Unfortunately,
Hillary Clinton has been complicit as well, and I'm not just talking
about her vote for the Iraq war.

I'll cut right to the chase: Hillary Clinton once introduced a bill
that would have made flag burning illegal. Thankfully it didn't pass.
In an article two years ago by Richard Cohen writing for the
Washington Post titled "Star-Spangled Pandering", he noted:

". . . this is not a proposed constitutional amendment, and it is
written in . . . a way that does not explicitly outlaw all flag
burnings -- just those intended to 'intimidate any person or group of
persons '"

And who will make that distinction? I presume law enforcement would
decide whether or not the flag burning was an act intended intimidate
others. That is a scary thought, but it is a scarier thought still
that anyone would even have to make that call. Burning the flag is a
form of public speech and therefore banning the act is tantamount to a
violation of the first ammendment to the constitution. Richard Cohen
closes his article by insisting:

"The First Amendment is where you simply do not go. It is sacred. It
protects our most cherished rights -- religion, speech, press and
assembly -- and while I sometimes turn viscerally angry when I see the
flag despoiled, my emotions are akin to what I feel when neo-Nazis
march. Repugnant or not, popular or not, it is all political speech."

I will certainly take Hillary Clinton's sponsoring of a bill that
would have infringed on Americans' constitutional rights into
consideration when deciding who to support in the forthcoming
election.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention.  I meant to go to this event but then just forgot about it.  Too busy.  I especially like Simic's poetry and would be interested to hear how it worked with jazz.  According to this review there wasn't too much interaction which was too bad, if true.  There are many lesser known poets who read compellingly with jazz musicians all the time.  Steve Dalachinsky and Eve Packer are the two who come to mind immediately who make jazz and poetry integral to each other.  It's too bad that their performances with musicians don't get reviewed or at least haven't to my knowledge.  Steve just published a book of 300 pages or so of his poems written at performances by the wonderful Saxophonist Charles Gayle over a twenty year period.  Jazz and poetry ( and contemporary classical music) occupies similar black holes in the collective American artistic consciousnesses, alas.  But the inmates do find reason and means to collaborate often.  I'm
 working with a prodigy classical composer named Oliver Hagen at the moment but have read with his father, John Hagen, a jazz musician and would be glad to do so again.  Regards, Tom Savage

Dear Buffalo Poetics List:


The University of California Press  is pleased to announce the publication of:

Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers

George Oppen (1908-1984) was born in New York and died in San
Francisco. He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1968 for _Of Being Numerous._
His work is available in _New Collected Poems,_ edited by Michael
Davidson (2002); _Selected Poems,_ edited by Robert Creeley (2003);
and _Selected Letters of George Oppen,_ edited by Rachel Blau
DuPlessis (1990). Stephen Cope received his PhD in 2005 from the
University of California, San Diego, where he was a research fellow
at the Archive for New Poetry, where Oppen's papers are housed. He
has taught at universities in California, Iowa, and Ohio.

http://go.ucpress.edu/OppenProse


"Here is the essential record of George Oppen's indelible voice,
astonishing as it wanders and discovers a new mode 'between the grim
gray lines of the Philistines and the ramshackle emplacements of
Bohemia' in order to recover an open ground that is, in the fact, '
the function of poetry to serve as a test of truth.' Few documents in
our time would better serve to illuminate the hard-won life of being
a poet in the American language than this volume, brilliantly edited
by Stephen Cope. Simply put, what a laboratory is to hard science,
these daybooks are to poetry."-Peter Gizzi, author of _The
Outernationale_



This is the first comprehensive critical edition of the unpublished
writings of Pulitzer Prize-winning objectivist poet George Oppen
(1908-1984). Editor Stephen Cope has made a judicious selection of
Oppen's extant writings outside of poetry, including the essay "The
Mind's Own Place" as well as "Twenty-Six Fragments," which were found
on the wall of Oppen's study after his death. Most notable are
Oppen's "Daybooks," composed in the decade following his return to
poetry in 1958. _Selected Prose, Daybooks, and Papers _is an
inspiring portrait of this essential writer and a testament to the
creative process itself.

Every time we have this conversation, Jim, I thoroughly enjoy myself. But before I respond to the more salient points you make, I do want to point one thing out about Deep Blue that often gets overlooked in the conversations about it. What Deep Blue did was very impressive, certainly. It learned its chess winning chess strategy (which while whether that actually beat kasparov or not is a bit controversial it could no doubt beat the pants off of me) on it's own, and that by itself is something that I think warrants its place in the history books. At the same time, the agreement Kasparov made with IBM, and which I think was a mistake on his part, allowed IBM to make adjustments to Deep Blue during the match but between games. That's important because one of those adjustments allowed the machine to avoid a trap it had fallen into twice previously, which if it hadn't done, Kasparov would have had mate.

That having been said, it being a bit of a pet peeve of mine to make that point whenever Deep Blue comes up, I do want to say that I don't think machine consciousness is impossible and that I agree that humans are largely mechanical (although to date there's no proof of this to come out of neuroscience and statements to the contrary are usually unpackable as a form of metaphysical bias). What I do believe is that whatever eventually allows us to create thinking machines is not going to be a software algorithm running on some sort of turing machine. The Dreyfus book is really good on this point, and I'm a little leery of paraphrasing him, but the basic argument boils down to this:

the concept of a computer as we currently understand it is some sort of logical, rule following machine that operates according to heuristics and algorithms. the analogy AI researchers often make, and have made for decades is between this and the human brain and the human mind. That is, the human brain is the hardware that runs the software algorithms that produce the mind as its output. Dreyfus argues, and I tend to agree with his argument, that while that can simulate what human consciousness is, it's not the same thing as a machine actually being conscious and for that the machine needs to be in the world and of the world and for the world always already the way that humans are. The reason being that the world is not composed of facts the way a computer needs to deal with them, as digital representations, but rather the world is composed of things and that the fundamental act of humanity is to cope with those things, not to make representations of them to ourselves.

I do like a lot of this stuff. I like Jackson Mac Low's poetry and Iannis Xenakis's music. At the same time, it's not something I enjoy reading or listening to so much as i find it interesting to observe. It engages a different part of my brain than does, for example, reading TS Eliot or listening to The Cure.

The Colrain Poetry Manuscript Conference, a unique conference designed for
poets with a book-length manuscript, has been a tremendous success, drawing
accomplished poets from all over the country and overseas. The conference
has been created for poets who are either ready to publish a book-length
manuscript or who feel they need a reality check on their current
manuscript-in-progress.  Since our first conference, in March of 2006, over
15 poets have had their manuscripts accepted for publication. The conference
has generated interest on the part of editors as well as a number of
interested poetry press publishers eager to participate.



On January 18, 2008, the ninth group of poets will meet in Greenfield,
Massachusetts to meet with leading poets and educators and to present their
manuscripts to editors from poetry presses. This conference will last three
days and include senior and founding editors from Graywolf Press and Ausable
Press as well as poets Fred Marchant and Joan Houlihan.   Complete
information and application can be found at:



http://www.colrainpoetry.com/January



*Note: There are two openings left for the January conference. *



Information on our upcoming conferences is available here:



http://www.colrainpoetry.com



The goal of the Colrain conference is to create a venue and network that
will help poets to be published, or at least to be placed on a realistic
path toward book publication.   Please know we wish to work only with
serious poets able to accept productive criticism of their work and/or their
manuscripts from poetry professionals.





Attendees say:



"The Colrain Manuscript Conference managed to pack into a weekend what a lot
of grad school teachers never had time to do in their classes or
individually: offer finishing touches to a manuscript eager to be picked up
by a publisher."

Steve Fellner, Brockport, NY



"...extremely helpful to hear responses to the other manuscripts. I learned
as much or more from the critiques of others' manuscripts as I did from the
critique of mine."

Mary Crow, Fort Collins, CO, Poet Laureate of Colorado



" Attending the Colrain Manuscript Conference was undoubtedly the most
profound poetry experience I've ever had. What I learned in forty-eight
hours will be with me for years to come."   Tracy Kroetsky, Berkley, CA



"...My consultation completely changed the way I view the manuscript. There
is nothing like what you are providing. Kudos!" Dawn Fewkes, Horseheads, NY



"...The Colrain conference was everything I'd hoped it would be and more. I
feel well on my way, now, to a publishable manuscript." Pat Lowry Collins,
MA

This is profoundly silly. It shouldn't be a surprise that the word
"poetry" (and poetic) means more than one thing, as does "prose" (and
prosaic). Hillary wasn't talking about literature or literary theory,
and she wasn't particularly worried about the poetry constituency.

As to the crying (she didn't, by the way--there was maybe a
microsecond catch in her voice), Hillary went into New Hampshire with
a considerable edge over Obama among registered Democrats. The
punditry decided that she'd lose all the indepenfdents, based solely
on the arcane Iowa process. Did everyone forget that Hillary's people
assumed months ago that she couldn't win in Iowa and only decided to
campaign there with some reluctance?

success at last, just for a moment

it has been a difficult few days in the virtual environments laboratory.
we moved most of the motion capture equipment to 109 to use, but couldn't
locate the bvh computer (which receives signals from an old 486 used with
proprietary hardware). the explanations written by the interns were miss-
ing as well. we knew the bvh machine had to be around. we found an old
dell and gary put windows 2000 on that, getting the key from another mach-
ine. we put bvh software on the old dell, but the signals from the 486,
which, it turned out, had to go through a router since we had no crossover
connectors, were crashing it. so we were back to square one. i figured if
i could locate a photo of the old bvh computer we'd used years ago, we
might be able to use it to match with one of the bunches of similar units
in 302c. i looked through archive after archive, until i located it; the
image was slightly blurred, but the layout of the masking tape label (un-
readable in the image) on top of the machine allowed us to narrow poss- ,
ible candidates to two. we found we couldn't get into either without pass-
words. i discovered a scrap of paper in a corner of the room, 302c, with a
password on it; it worked. so now we set them both up and one of them,
which had been used as a projector connection to a virtual wall, was it.
we brought the machine down to 109 and it almost ran; at least the soft-
ware didn't crash. i found changing the antenna parameters for the motion
capture and moving from ascii to binary and from tcp to udp did the trick.
gary set up the 5100 port and addresses and we produced slomo.bvh as he
moved the sensors slowly around; i wanted to duplicate the speed of the
5-7 frames per second output of the 486, instead of working high-speed as
i usually do. we brought the bvh file to poser on a compaq laptop which
for some reason is now permanently misconfigured but usable; the result is
http://www.alansondheim.org/slowmo.mov which i quite quite like; if you
ignore the hand fluttering, the movement is closer to what we need to work
with at the moment. as far as the hand-fluttering is concerned, we're
going to internally turn off the hand sensors by modifying the capture
program, written in c, but with clear documentation; even a non-programmer
like myself can get into it a bit. now to slow things down further so the
inconceivable happens at the speed of amoeba-learning; in addition, to
transform avatar into deity-emanent, following, introjecting yamantaka or
one or another manifestation, moving mind and sheave-body into other
realms far beyond 486, 2000, 109, 302c, 5-7, until what ever may appear in
the future brought quickly back to earth.

Dear Eric:

I appreciate your concern regrading the First Amendment, though criticizing
Hillary Clinton for sponsoring a bill re Flag Burning that didn't pass is a
rather narrow frame for examining what the US Senate and Congress have been
rubber stamping for the last 7 years, much of it far far worse than a failed
consideration of torching Old Glory.

And the ugliness and suppression already very active, alive and well in a
continual barrage of attacks on the First Amendment is about to get much
uglier.

 Free Speech has been under harassment and attack by private individuals,
corporations and interest lobbies for a very long time, and in recent years
has been evoking memories of the 1950's Black Listings and McCarthyism.
Critics of U.S and especially Israeli policies have been targeted and
lecture and book events cancelled, music and theater events cancelled,
Presses have been threatened with loss of distribution,  persons have lost
jobs or nearly lost them, their reputations smeared and research demeaned.
The American media mainstream is heavily censored as are a lot of the
"alternative" media and events. There is a small library now out of books
dedicated to the censor ships of the Bush era, of Middle East reporting,
and  harassment of "average" citizens, including children,  who have written
anti-Bush email or drawn pictures in school considered in some way offensive
to the Dear Leader.

 The First Amendment actually is a form of double standard as it is applied
in practice.  To paraphrase Orwell's Animal Farm, "All Speech is Free, but
some is more Free than others."  (See for example the two volume "Paper of
Record" hefty tomes devoted solely to the NY Times' more than dubious
practices.)

Congress and almost all the candidates for President are beholden to
corporate and special interest lobbies, which means that with regards to
Free Speech criticism of these, they have implicitly pledged to minimize any
form of open discussion, presentation of ideas, research, or dissidence.
All the Democrats running for President except for Kucinich and Gravel
signed documents with AIPAC which places the protection of Israel and its
interests at the highest level, almost beyond those of the US itself.
Kucinich and Gravel have fared badly at finding media coverage, even being
ignored during the televised debates. (Due not only to AIPAC, but other
reasons as well.  After all, if they are "minimized" in the media--this
makes them into "candidates too minimal to cover much."  A form of
self-fulfilling prophecy disguised as a "fair and balanced" "reportage.")

Pharmaceuticals, Big Oil, a host of others effect Free Speech every day.
Obama has said he would invade Pakistan, Hillary, Edwards, Obama have all
kept the nuke option open for Iran.  None of them has done anything much in
office regarding the War in Iraq, health care, insurance and mortgage
frauds on massive-beyond-belief scales going out of control and dragging the
economy down with them , , , and so far of over 2500 questions addressed to
the candidates during the debates, only 3 have concerned the environment.
Far, far ore media time has been spent listening to the candidates discuss
just how badly they would torture "terrorist"  "detainees" than has been
devoted to the catastrophic evidences that the environment is in Blowback
mode.

There are far worse things coming though.  The House last fall passed H.R.
1955 (an almost entirely Democrat-sponsored Bill)--and Senate will be voting
on this soon.  So far, it appears to be a lock to pass, with perhaps a few
revisions or extras attached.

Below are links for the text of the Bill and  another with more information
about it.

Whoever does become President will be very dangerous, as the current
Presidency has systemically chopped away as many as possible of the "checks
and balances' on an Imperial Presidency.  The dismantling of the
Constitution, the tearing up and reconstruction of the bureaucracy and civil
service, the appointment of a huge number of judges who find the
Constitution and current laws and Amendments in need of over turning--all
these have been putting into place the structure for an ever more open form
of fascism than the one already merrily moving along.  H.R. 1955 will speed
up this process immeasurably.

Even with the laws currently in place, it is possible the next election
could be suspended for "reasons of national crisis and security" if an
attack on Iran and perhaps Pakistan is under way.  "Too dangerous to change
governments during a time of global crisis, you know."  It's hard to imagine
the current Congress and Senate doing much about it--or even having the
means to do so, having rubber stamped their own powers out of existence.
Hitler, after all, came to power under the laws of the time, democratically
and legally.  The he turned around used the laws to install himself in
absolute power and get rid of the laws which had put him there.

Having failed with a remake of the Iraq 'WMD"  reasons for War with Iran,
now the US is "testing the waters" of a potential remake of the Gulf of
Tonkin incident that was "lift off time" for the Vietnam escalation.

As a "Writing Experiment"  "compare and contrast" the following:

Amendment I to the Constitution of the United States of America

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.GovTrack:

"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"--

Mao was a poet

Pol Pot loved poetry.  His favorite poet was that musician of the French
language, Paul Verlaine.

Perhaps Hillary remembers all too well that her husband, when President,
gave a "volume" of Walt Whitman's  poetry as a gift to Monica Lewinsky for
her aiding him in staining her dress with a "sample" of his DNA.

Poetry and prose both have long been the accomplices of Power.

And both have been Power's opponents.

And Big Bill Clinton--how often did he not let trickle the hint of a tear,
get a sob in his voice, give that "humble and uplifted Look?"

Dear David,

The example of the flag burning bill that Hillary sponsored is
important specifically because she is running for president now. It is
by no means the only instance of affronts to personal liberties by
certain American politicians (therefore more broadly the US gov't) but
it is worth focusing on because she went out of her way to draw up the
thing and present it for consideration to her fellow senators. We
could cherry pick different examples all day, but it is mainly -- but
not solely -- the Bush administration who is to blame for the sorry
standing our nation finds itself in. In order to prevent another
Republican from being president, we must elect someone who is not of
that ilk, presumably a Democrat. Hillary is a politician and I am not
surprised that she would stoop to such levels, and so it should be
weighed that she explicitly doesn't believe in freedom of speech. It
points to a greater attitude in this perceived time of national terror
that in order to "protect the citizens", certain 'liberties' can be
eroded or simply bypassed. There are of course very specific reasons
why it would be in politicians' interests to promote such causes.
Orwell wrote in 1984, "The object of persecution is persecution. The
object of torture is torture. The object of power is power." As we
unwittingly put another head into power, let's air out all the dirty
laundry.

Dear Eric:

I am not sure if you understood what I wrote.

The entirety of the piece is how Free Speech has been well on its way out
for a long time, there is already censorship on a grand scale, and--in many
cases, censorship does  not to become law to be practised. And the situation
is about to get far worse.

For seven years now, the entire government, House and Senate both, have been
passing laws which have created all kinds of inroads on Free Speech.  Over
and over again our elected officials have sold the citizens done the river.
Probably persons have become so used to this it has become invisible.

I know very well what Hillary--and al the other candidates stand for and it
is NOT Freedom of Speech. None of them. For example, signing a doucment from
AIPAC means one is going to be against criticism of Israeli policies as much
as possible.  Getting support from a big corporation means looking out for
their interests.  That means suppressing Free Speech when it interferes with
the functioning of that corporation.  Censorship by omission is just as
effective as censorship by commission and use of a law.


Did you read the H.R. 1955 texts--?


Basically the terms in it are vague enough that almost anyone could be,
without its taking too much "poetic license,"  accused of some truly
terrible things or even very small things-- and--well--who knows?  Years of
detention without being charged?  A rendition trip to a "holiday overseas,"
a "tour of the world's secret American prisons?"  A chance to test
waterboarding for oneself?

NONE of the major candidates is for "Free Speech"--

Jewish Voice for Peace has an excellent newsletter called "Muzzlewatch"
whose latest report I received today.  It concerns the absence of anything
being asked or said about Israel-Palestine by any of the major candidates,
and gives examples of the very few times this has been addressed, in which
the candidates, including Obama and Edwards, ignored the questions.

"Sins of omission" are a way of signalling things which are "not to be
talked about."  In other words, NOT Free Speech. Censorship does not need
laws for its existence.  There are a myriad ways in which it operates.

I used to write for newspapers.  Newspapers are controlled by boards, who
are controlled by the investors--advertisers, big corporations, interest
groups--all of these influence what can and cannot be written and read, what
can be written not now, but later (if ever), what may be written about in a
piece while also what needs to be omitted, and a host of other methods for
"controlling" the "sharing" of "information" with the public.  (Think how
many times you may have read about stories being held until permission was
granted for their release.)

 All the major news outlets in the USA use MEMRI for their coverage of the
Middle East.  MEMRI is known to be manufacturer of deliberate
mis-translations and dis-translations, planted, deliberately fake stories,
as well as a censorship machine.  There isn't any  law that says American
media have to use this organization, yet they do.  They choose to knowingly
use an organization known for disinformation and censorship.  And no one is
the wiser--no one cares, until it is far too late.  It takes a while before
people begin to wonder if their lives are being radically affected by things
untrue and manipulated, because one is always being assured that everything
one hears and knows takes place "in a Free society."

None of the candidates has brought up any of these issues in which Free
Speech is involved every minute of every hour.  It would be biting the hand
that feeds them in terms of "covering their campaigns."  And, behind the
pages of the newspapers and the screens of the tv, the studios of the
radio--biting the hands of the very ones who are funding both the the media
and the campaigns.

That right there is an immense and isolating censorship.

You write that Hillary is a "politician" and "will stoop to anything."


Dear friend--are not the Senators Obama and Edwards also politicians, also
running for President,  who have also most likely already done some pretty
low stooping themselves?

 In fact, the whole government has stooped extremely low for years and years
now--so low one refrains from saying the obvious--in too explicit
terms----kowtowing and rubber stamping the Bush Administration's demands,
the Administration's truly horrifying series of Attorney Generals,
Ambassadors, Supreme Court Justices, Secretaries of the various departments
of everything from Transportation, Education, Health to the wonders of the
STate and Defense Departments and the immense new bureaucracy of Homeland
Security.   Bush and Cheney are not alone, Hillary isn't alone--they are a
great great many and they were al elected to represent you and I.  And
elected by if not you and I a great many of our compatriots!

I am not "cherry picking examples" but writing of a huge censorship  already
in existence and with the passage of H.R. 1955 the abyss yawns vastly much
wider.
  The Senators and Congress persons have obediently and fearfully--who wants
to look "weak" on terrorism, on Homeland Security?--just voted for every
obscneity that came along.   Everyone of the Bush appointees that persons
love to hate, had to be approved of by our elected Representatives.  The
media for years has gone along for the ride. Censorship has been part and
parcel of our everyday lives for so long now that is "second nature."

The issue of torture is a corollary to that of Free Speech perils.

Censorship is to "silence."  Torture is TO FORCE ONE TO SPEAK.

The Bills that al the Democrats, the majors ones, have voted FOR are already
far WORSE than the flag burning one.  I agree with you that flag burning is
a Right that should not be taken away. And yes it is terrible Hillary put
her mind to this issue with such dedication. Look at all the huge number of
sinister  Bills that have passed, however.  Look how many others have been
and continue to be and will be with these new laws, will be taken away on a
far greater scale with a far greater and more terrifying bunch of procedures
and punishments

Notice also one of the main stated intentions of this Bill--the creation of
a huge academic center for the study of Homegrown Terrorism and "Violent
Radicalism."  This further involves the academic world in its creations of
new methods, new categories, new statistics, new information on citizens
than it already is.  The House has already passed it and given the record of
the Senate, it will be law before very long.

Will a Democrat be al the much "better" i the White House?  Of course one
hopes so!!  But given the record of al of them one doesn't see much real
chance of a change.  The Democrats introduced H R 1955 and  Pelosi made it
an immediate statement of hers on becoming Speaker than there would be no
options open for Impeachment.  On the other hand, all options are open for
nuking countries on the slightest of pretexts, or simply on invented ones.

The Bush Administration never could have accomplished what it has if it had
not been for the continual approval and votes of the House and Senate.
Pelosi was among those who knew from the start about the torture and other
horrors going on.  Other governmental officials on various committees and
boards did also.  No one objected that the Constitution might be in great
danger with the steps that were being taken.  They all went along.

Any time in which a Government says that it is at War and that Homeland
Security is at risk--it is time of grave danger for civil
liberties,especially  freedom of expression.  Persons who are critical of
the events and decisions being made immediately find their lives and work in
jeopardy--or  are on the verge of risking this.  Look how incredibly passive
the United States has been during the last twenty five years.  Aggressive
abroad, passive at home.  It takes an entire culture to contribute to this.


And that is one of the most nightmarish aspects of al of this.  By steady
degrees so many things that once would have been thought impossible are now
laws--and an entire culture has been wlaking steadily into a nightmare which
it has already been undergoing such a long acclimatization to that it barely
is aware of what is happening to it.

What I am trying to say is--don't limit what you are being critical of to
Hillary and Bush.  It took an entire government, a whole nation to create
this situation.  And those not involved in creating it for the most part
passively accepting it. Let alone the Senators and Congress actively giving
approval and untold billions of funding for the nightmare.  And by passively
I don't mean "violent radicalization."  I mean quite often simply speaking
out about what is happening in a way which goes beyond the very narrow
limits that one is "supposed to stay inside of."

Two books I'd recommend  are Naomi Wolf's The End of America and Naomi
Klein's The Shock Doctrine.

Especially the latter, one of the finest books of last year.

heuristics are algorithms, Jason. a heuristic is an algorithm that may not
do the task the best way (if there is a best way) but hopefully copes with
the situation. but it is an algorithm.

an algorithm is simply a list of well-defined instructions for executing a
task. Could be for baking a cake or consciousness souffle.

we have sensory input. sight sound smell touch taste proprioception.
possibly others we haven't put a finger on. computers can have sensory input
and bodies also. no doubt they would be different sensory inputs and
different bodies. with different needs, weaknesses, strengths, abilities,
and so on. any machine intelligence would be very very different from ours
thereby.

but they could still be conscious, sentient, moral agents.

they could learn. and change their behavior thereby. as we do (sometimes).
they could learn to be very discerning, as we do. they could learn to
disobey the rules under certain circumstances, as we do. all of this is
possible while still being programmed.

we are bio machines. nobody programmed us. nobody designed us. we have
evolved for 2.5 billion years, like every other living thing on this planet,
apparently. we are coded. not in a language. in bio code. for instance, our
memories are coded. our dna is coded. not in a language, because we think of
language as requiring conscious creators/designers, but in code. algorithms
can operate at that level too. algorithms can be staggeringly flexible. if
if if if if if if if if if if if if... but regardless of our propensity to
talk about algorithms in language--which gives the impression that language
is required to code an algorithm--they do not require language, only code.
if we see a little black box  that has behavior, and when we do x it always
does y, then regardless of whether its behavior is written in language, it
is using an algorithm.

 Dear David,




Mark your calendar. This January 11th is the 6th anniversary of the
first transfer of detainees to Guant=E1namo Bay. To mark the occasion we
are taking part in a worldwide protest denouncing torture and unlawful
detentions.  The largest protest will be in Washington but nation-wide
Peace Action affiliates will mark this day with their own actions.
Find out about the local events happening that day near you, here.






Orange jumpsuits provided...

 An AI protester stands outside the US Supreme Court to mark the 5th
anniversary of Guantanamo Bay detentions. Join us January 11th on the
National Mall. At U.S. embassies and other prominent locations in
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Greece and right here
in Washington DC, activists will rise up against the failed
interrogation regime at Guant=E1namo.










 Join us on the National Mall in Washington, DC on January 11th.

WHEN: Friday, January 11th at 11am
 WHERE: National Mall at 12 St NW (Smithsonian Metro)
 WHAT: Protest. Arrive early so you can suit up in an orange jumpsuit
and join the visual count of current detainees.

Join peace and justice activists all over the world and across our
nation to call for the closure of Guant=E1namo Bay, we cannot relent
until justice prevails. Counter terror with justice at home and
abroad.
 Sincerely,

Anybody know of any easily excerpted long or short fiction pieces that were written as responses to / "translations" of works of non-literary art? I feel certain that they're out there, but I'm drawing a blank and I need to find something asap for the workshop I'm teaching.

Thanks,

Perhaps this will help you--

1) go to my ekphrasis (poetry) blog--
poetryaboutart.wordpress.com

2) in right sidebar, under lower category "Ekphrasis
Links," click on "David Wright's class"

3) under his category "Examples of Ekphrasis," first
three listings are for fiction

Also, Susan Vreeland's historical fiction about major
artists might help you. See her website--
www.svreeland.com

Some recent work by Dan Waber:

At the Light & Dust Anthology of Poetry I've got some new work up of
two sorts--there's a bit of prose on the work of bpNichol, and there's
a digital reworking of bpNichol's TTA29 (done with Jason Pimble).

 It's true that Pelosi & company went along with much of the Bush administrations infringement of our civil liberties. But it's hard for me to believe that they would have initiated the same or similiar policies.  The democratic congress is known for being spineless. Isn't it better to regard the current crop of candidtates in terms of who would be most likely to cause the least amount of harm? Other wise, our vote is meaningless since all parties are equally at fault.

David Chirot <david.chirot@GMAIL.COM> wrote: Dear Eric:

I am not sure if you understood what I wrote.

The entirety of the piece is how Free Speech has been well on its way out
for a long time, there is already censorship on a grand scale, and--in many
cases, censorship does  not to become law to be practised. And the situation
is about to get far worse.

For seven years now, the entire government, House and Senate both, have been
passing laws which have created all kinds of inroads on Free Speech.  Over
and over again our elected officials have sold the citizens done the river.
Probably persons have become so used to this it has become invisible.

I know very well what Hillary--and al the other candidates stand for and it
is NOT Freedom of Speech. None of them. For example, signing a doucment from
AIPAC means one is going to be against criticism of Israeli policies as much
as possible.  Getting support from a big corporation means looking out for
their interests.  That means suppressing Free Speech when it interferes with
the functioning of that corporation.  Censorship by omission is just as
effective as censorship by commission and use of a law.


Did you read the H.R. 1955 texts--?


Basically the terms in it are vague enough that almost anyone could be,
without its taking too much "poetic license,"  accused of some truly
terrible things or even very small things-- and--well--who knows?  Years of
detention without being charged?  A rendition trip to a "holiday overseas,"
a "tour of the world's secret American prisons?"  A chance to test
waterboarding for oneself?

NONE of the major candidates is for "Free Speech"--

Jewish Voice for Peace has an excellent newsletter called "Muzzlewatch"
whose latest report I received today.  It concerns the absence of anything
being asked or said about Israel-Palestine by any of the major candidates,
and gives examples of the very few times this has been addressed, in which
the candidates, including Obama and Edwards, ignored the questions.

"Sins of omission" are a way of signalling things which are "not to be
talked about."  In other words, NOT Free Speech. Censorship does not need
laws for its existence.  There are a myriad ways in which it operates.

I used to write for newspapers.  Newspapers are controlled by boards, who
are controlled by the investors--advertisers, big corporations, interest
groups--all of these influence what can and cannot be written and read, what
can be written not now, but later (if ever), what may be written about in a
piece while also what needs to be omitted, and a host of other methods for
"controlling" the "sharing" of "information" with the public.  (Think how
many times you may have read about stories being held until permission was
granted for their release.)

 All the major news outlets in the USA use MEMRI for their coverage of the
Middle East.  MEMRI is known to be manufacturer of deliberate
mis-translations and dis-translations, planted, deliberately fake stories,
as well as a censorship machine.  There isn't any  law that says American
media have to use this organization, yet they do.  They choose to knowingly
use an organization known for disinformation and censorship.  And no one is
the wiser--no one cares, until it is far too late.  It takes a while before
people begin to wonder if their lives are being radically affected by things
untrue and manipulated, because one is always being assured that everything
one hears and knows takes place "in a Free society."

None of the candidates has brought up any of these issues in which Free
Speech is involved every minute of every hour.  It would be biting the hand
that feeds them in terms of "covering their campaigns."  And, behind the
pages of the newspapers and the screens of the tv, the studios of the
radio--biting the hands of the very ones who are funding both the the media
and the campaigns.

That right there is an immense and isolating censorship.

You write that Hillary is a "politician" and "will stoop to anything."


Dear friend--are not the Senators Obama and Edwards also politicians, also
running for President,  who have also most likely already done some pretty
low stooping themselves?

 In fact, the whole government has stooped extremely low for years and years
now--so low one refrains from saying the obvious--in too explicit
terms----kowtowing and rubber stamping the Bush Administration's demands,
the Administration's truly horrifying series of Attorney Generals,
Ambassadors, Supreme Court Justices, Secretaries of the various departments
of everything from Transportation, Education, Health to the wonders of the
STate and Defense Departments and the immense new bureaucracy of Homeland
Security.   Bush and Cheney are not alone, Hillary isn't alone--they are a
great great many and they were al elected to represent you and I.  And
elected by if not you and I a great many of our compatriots!

I am not "cherry picking examples" but writing of a huge censorship  already
in existence and with the passage of H.R. 1955 the abyss yawns vastly much
wider.
  The Senators and Congress persons have obediently and fearfully--who wants
to look "weak" on terrorism, on Homeland Security?--just voted for every
obscneity that came along.   Everyone of the Bush appointees that persons
love to hate, had to be approved of by our elected Representatives.  The
media for years has gone along for the ride. Censorship has been part and
parcel of our everyday lives for so long now that is "second nature."

The issue of torture is a corollary to that of Free Speech perils.

Censorship is to "silence."  Torture is TO FORCE ONE TO SPEAK.

The Bills that al the Democrats, the majors ones, have voted FOR are already
far WORSE than the flag burning one.  I agree with you that flag burning is
a Right that should not be taken away. And yes it is terrible Hillary put
her mind to this issue with such dedication. Look at all the huge number of
sinister  Bills that have passed, however.  Look how many others have been
and continue to be and will be with these new laws, will be taken away on a
far greater scale with a far greater and more terrifying bunch of procedures
and punishments

Notice also one of the main stated intentions of this Bill--the creation of
a huge academic center for the study of Homegrown Terrorism and "Violent
Radicalism."  This further involves the academic world in its creations of
new methods, new categories, new statistics, new information on citizens
than it already is.  The House has already passed it and given the record of
the Senate, it will be law before very long.

Will a Democrat be al the much "better" i the White House?  Of course one
hopes so!!  But given the record of al of them one doesn't see much real
chance of a change.  The Democrats introduced H R 1955 and  Pelosi made it
an immediate statement of hers on becoming Speaker than there would be no
options open for Impeachment.  On the other hand, all options are open for
nuking countries on the slightest of pretexts, or simply on invented ones.

The Bush Administration never could have accomplished what it has if it had
not been for the continual approval and votes of the House and Senate.
Pelosi was among those who knew from the start about the torture and other
horrors going on.  Other governmental officials on various committees and
boards did also.  No one objected that the Constitution might be in great
danger with the steps that were being taken.  They all went along.

Any time in which a Government says that it is at War and that Homeland
Security is at risk--it is time of grave danger for civil
liberties,especially  freedom of expression.  Persons who are critical of
the events and decisions being made immediately find their lives and work in
jeopardy--or  are on the verge of risking this.  Look how incredibly passive
the United States has been during the last twenty five years.  Aggressive
abroad, passive at home.  It takes an entire culture to contribute to this.


And that is one of the most nightmarish aspects of al of this.  By steady
degrees so many things that once would have been thought impossible are now
laws--and an entire culture has been wlaking steadily into a nightmare which
it has already been undergoing such a long acclimatization to that it barely
is aware of what is happening to it.

What I am trying to say is--don't limit what you are being critical of to
Hillary and Bush.  It took an entire government, a whole nation to create
this situation.  And those not involved in creating it for the most part
passively accepting it. Let alone the Senators and Congress actively giving
approval and untold billions of funding for the nightmare.  And by passively
I don't mean "violent radicalization."  I mean quite often simply speaking
out about what is happening in a way which goes beyond the very narrow
limits that one is "supposed to stay inside of."

Two books I'd recommend  are Naomi Wolf's The End of America and Naomi
Klein's The Shock Doctrine.

Especially the latter, one of the finest books of last year.

THINKING OF MICHAEL DAVIDSON’S BOOK ON MASCULINITY WHILE LISTENING TO
DAVID SHAPIRO ON PENNSOUND


I said to Jasper Johns
I was walking with Allen Ginsberg
I wrote a book with Jacques Derrida
When I was at Columbia
It was one of those wonderful days
I commute a lot but I write while I’m commuting
Joe writes a lot when he commutes too
I dedicate this to the painter Jeremy Rahl
I hardly knew Kenneth then
I had memorized everything in the New York Public Library
I met Kenneth and I loved him
I met Joe Ceravalo and Frank Lima
We won the avant garde book award
We met almost all the time that we could
It was one of the first times that I had an essay in a dream
After that dream essay came this poem by Joe which is of course
Not by Joe but by me
That was a poem given to me by Joe
Kenneth said he did he did win a national award
This is a poem for Joe
I’ll read another poem for Joe
I said when I was off the air
This is a poem I wrote thinking about how often we’d meet
He said, “I want to åfound a school, David.”
I said, “Oh that sounds great, Joe.”
And he said, “Yes, you know.”
I also met Allen Ginsberg a lot and we would walk
I am referring mostly to Charles Ives
Allen Ginsberg walked beside me
That is influenced by Samuel Beckett’s radio play Oh Joe
I was writing a book with Jacques Derrida
I heard a dog crying the day I had to give one seminar on prayer
Rabbi Heschel, the great protestor, his wife is now my cousin by 			marriage
I wrote this work for Joe Ceravalo, my friend
At Bard College where I taught
I’ve always wanted to do an opera, it wd be very Kochian
I want to read something less lugubrious
I do have a lot of elegies
I’m getting to this age where people want me to write my memoirs
I said to Jasper Johns a year or two ago
When I was at Columbia I once threatened self-destruction to Kenneth Koch
This is a poem I wrote walking around the George Washington Bridge
Frank Lima writes in the subway every morning at six o’clock
My welsh terrier walked around this park a lot
I dedicate this to the painter Jeremy Rall
This was pre-Giuliani
Paul Georges once said
It’s like one of those moments in Wallace Stevens
I want to read something for Rudy Burkhart
Of the great friends that I’ve lost, Kenneth Koch, Joe Ceravalo, Meyer
Schapiro
Jacob and I, Jacob his son, has worked with me at Cooper Union
I said to Rudy I said your the best photographer in America
He left me, he left my son, really, a hundred photographs
He drowned himself like his friend Edmund Denby
He said You’re always giving me gifts, and he said Yes no more gifts
So I wrote this song for Rudy
He loved New York, he also loved nature
I said to him you’re the best nature photographer
Antininio said I love Monica Vita but I also love a while line on a street
Rudy really knew how to make a white line on a street as beautiful as a
women, it’s very hard to do
The architect John Hejduk makes a great drawing every day
He’s another great friend and I’ll read a poem for him later
Here’s another poem for Rudy and it’s really a 9-11 poem
I wrote a lot
I was a violinist
I was like a trained monkey and my family was all trained monkeys
My grandfather was one of the great singers of the world
He’s a composer also
He was very important
You can still go to Judaica stores and buy them
Mozart is a standard
Where Glenn Gould is playing
My father was not only a violist but a sculptor
He studied with a student of Rodin
I remember when Kenneth said congratulations on yr dual career
I married an architect
She introduced me to Meyer Schapiro
He defended Jackson Pollock

This was published in South Africa when I was 12
Every poem of mine is an act of resistance
The old surrealists have grown up and have good jobs
A lot of us used to dream whether our names wd be next to Thucydides

david,

chiming in here.

i don't know the history of arguments surrounding free speech.  in the case
you cited, H.R. 1955, at least part of the problem seems to be with
statements by independent civilians that would be used to incite violence.
it seems to me that this at least in part raises an issue of interpretation,
and that interpretation depends, in part, on one's religion, one's
background.  so you can have a group of people who are pacifist, militant,
monotheist, polytheist, what have you, all reading the same text and all
seeing echoes of their own faith system.  i think this is a good thing.
because the text not only echoes the militant reverence for god, it also
echoes pacifist wishes for nonviolence.  if someone is killed it is hard to
argue about what happened, no matter what one's faith system, in so far as
there is a corpse and that is the bottom line.  same thing with other forms
of violence.  and i think that desire to assert one's own view may be part
of the impetus for inscripting things violently, you get a literal signature
and interpretative positioning that is indelible.  i can not tell you how
heartbreaking that is to me.  we don't need violent signatures on things to
sort out religious conflict.  it's useful, but it's the easy way out, i
think it's the cowards way out, to say i can kill so you'd better believe me
because my views are not going to persuade people who don't share my
assumptions.  vote democratic or i'll break your arms, as they say in one of
my favorite cities.  i can see that, but it's the easy way out.

but for the purpose of discussion, in philosophical terms, you can have
texts that contain both worlds, that swallow the militance, suicide bombing
and service to god, in all of its honor, in a different system of reverence,
say pacifism, or sermon on the mount, or zen.  you can give the killing a
different theatre that doesn't require bloodshed  is that ok?  is it
respectful of other faiths?  is it too much cheek?  i don't know.  is it
fair?  i don't know.  but i think it is possible to build dialogic
containers for violent feelings and thoughts, and in so doing to expand the
capacity of different peoples to sit down and chat, in spirit of respect,
perhaps even friendship.  the measure of interpretation is what is in one's
own soul.  go there.  what's there.  no one else can say.  as pound wrote,
something like, there are so many things in the heart, and there is no end
of talking.  we have all been harmed by this war, i mean the peoples of
so many different countries and faiths.  i think we have enough shared pain
by now to be able to come together and see what might work in terms of
sorting some things out, collectively, for the planet.  if there were an
innate limit to human pain, there would not be as much death.  i think we
are responsible to limit the pain we go ahead and inflict, and stop.

in the balance of freedom, or peace, which is more important, and how is
that decided.  or what kinds of things are freedom worth, if there are
prices other than killing.

I've looked on the net at several resources and the term ekphrasitc seems to refer to cross-medium responses, as in poems on visual art or visual art on music, etc. But does it/could it also include responses to the work in the same medium (Dan Beachy-Quick's Spell, a book of poems that enters into and engages Moby-Dick (and even features autoekphrasis - the commenting on the commenting, as it were, with poems in the form of correspondence to the editor))?  Or is there another word for this?

Subject:      Two Iranian Literature-related Announcements
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="US-ASCII"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have two things I'd like to announce to the list:

1. PUBLICATION: "A Bird in the Garden of Angels," by John Moyne with Richard
Jeffrey Newman, a new Rumi reader published by Mazda Publishers
(www.mazdapublisher.com/BookDetails.aspx?BookID=231), is now available. The
books contains selections from all of the genres in which Rumi wrote, some
of which have never been translated before. John Moyne, the primary
translator--I collaborated with him on the poetry sections--has also
published new versions of poems on which he originally worked with Coleman
Barks. The book, which is intended as an introduction to Rumi for a general
readership, contains as well two essays, one on Rumi's life and one on
Sufism.

2. READING AND OPEN MIC: Persian Arts Festival, www.persianartsfestival.org,
the organization for which I serve as Literary Arts Director, has
reestablished the monthly Shab-e She'r (Night Of Persian Poetry) that used
to be held at The Bowery Poetry Club, though we are broadening the scope of
the event to include not only classical Iranian poetry (Rumi, Sa'di, Hafez,
in Persian and in translation), but also contemporary Iranian,
Iranian-American or Iranian-connected literature, both prose and poetry.
There is a featured reader and then an open mic. The open mic is for anyone
who would like to read in Persian and/or English; all we ask is that the
material you read have some connection to Iran, Iranian culture, the
Iranian-American experience, etc.

PAF's Shab-e She'r will take place on the third Wednesday of every month
through May, from 6-8 PM at the Bowery Poetry Club. Admission is $12, which
buys you one drink. The next Shab-e She'r is Wednesday, January 16 and out
featured reader is Roger Sedarat (http://sedarat.com), whose first book of
poems, Dear Regime: Letters to the Islamic Republic, just won Ohio
University's Hollis Summers Poetry Prize. Here is the title poem:

Dear Regime,

After you've ground him into powder,
you can burn this to a fine ash. His family feels
it would be better off with nothing.

My father returned from Iran wit everything but his bones.
He said customs claimed them as government property.
We laid him on a Persian carpet in front of the television.
When I'd hold his wrist to his face
because he wanted to know the time,
we could see the holes made by the swords in his elbow.
His arms reminded of kebab kubideh.
It was hard for him to look outside;
he said the cumulus clouds
were too much like marrow
and he couldn't stand watching the dog
sniff the backyard, searching
for the rest of him. My sister and I put him to bed
thinking that beside our mother
he'd turn into himself,
but through the door we only heard him crying,
telling his wife he could never again make love,
and through the keyhole we saw her shivering with him
wrapped around her like an old blanket
until he died one morning.
She folded him into a rectangle,
mailing him in a white shoebox
back to his country.

Images from open house, Morgantown model railroad club, embodying cuts
from one scale to another, from human to true world, from mind to emanent.
Who would call this the postmodern? One might locate something else here:
not the cut but the suture, not disparity but deep memory; the locales
represented, real and imaginary, conjure the West Virginia landscape of
the 1950s, in the memory of many of the club members. What better than a
photograph than a reconstruction in which everything is punctum, intended?

The photographs are of the text, of this text; they're weaker without it,
they go elsewhere, I'm pulling them back in. I'm pulling them back in to
indicate multiculturalisms and emphases on locale and habitus tend both
suture and division (these people, these others) in favor of _listening_
and its phenomenology.

But listening is skew-orthogonal, again, to the _style_ of the images,
based on any number of photographers and trajectories.

Now what do I see when I do not know what I see? Certainly aspects and
entities are present within the true world filtered through the history of
photography and photographers who have no responsibility for me.

Where are the passengers in this life? Where are the passengers in the
life of the other?

You can already feel the economy of the land, extractive industries, pov-
erty, environmental pollution, mountain-topping, strip-mining, deep-min-
ing, feed stores, small towns in the hollows, grey dust, what's worn is
worn, what's not is brought into play through deep memory's suture which
even bends, transfigures the landscape, someday we'll all rise to the
surface.

I will live forever
I will live forever
I will live forever
As a hungry ghost
As a hungry ghost
I will live forever

I don't remember the exact name of the railroad club or the members. Some-
one named Mike, I believe, made the larger mine model. I came in as a
tourist finding nameless things. the models were both outstanding, depres-
sing to an outsider. The images appeared as images, imaginary, with what-
ever context I might bring from the outside; the social depth was absent.
I turned to the jump-cut.

The jump-cut was of the visual, that disparity of mind and scale. Railroad
switching systems were fundamental to the development of the Internet.
Evidence of electronic skein was everywhere. Jump-cut sutured into dream-
scape, dream-screen, displacement/condensation semiotics. What is of truth
or tending towards the indexical in the images applies as well to the vis-
ual in general, compounding of memory, suture, cut, surface. Whatever one
sees is surface, surface-only; x-rays report on deeper surfaces,
translucent or transparent to invisible light.

The photographs bother me, as if theory needed image-propping beyond the
diagrammatic. But what can the image hold, if not an arrangement that
might be constituted as evidence? If a diagram is indexical or symbolic,
the photograph resides elsewhere; evidence stands for nothing and hardly
represents itself, nor is it pointing towards something across ontological
or epistemological lines. On this level the photograph simply reports as
Bazin might have it, on what-is, or rather the what-is and thetic con-
strues within the dialog of image production. In any case, the postmodern
is left behind, or rather, is relegated to analyses of socio-economic
phenomena where the theory works wonders; think of postmodern geography,
Harvey or Roja for example.

What would postmodern geography make of mountain-topping? And then its
representation which makes the wrecked landscape somehow graspable,
something to walk around, replant with meadow or pasture?

I think of tantra, mandala, Jefferey Hopkins' introduction to the Kala-
chakra Tantra (Kalachakra Tantra, Rite of Initiation, Dali Lama, 1999).
Hopkins walks/writes the body of the reader through the mandala ("Notice
the entryway at the eastern door, wider than the doorway, with a three
storied portico above the entranceway. Each of the stories of the portico
above the entryway has four pillars across the front, thereby creating
three room-like alcoves on each story. In each of these eight alcoves are
goddesses of offering; the middle alcove in the first story on the eastern
side has a black wheel of doctrine with a buck and doe to the right and
left." And so forth.) Now think of the Morgantown railroad club images in
the same or different shimmer, think not of the imminent/immanent identi-
fication of entities within them, but of paths through or around or by
virtue of these entities, which themselves are processes (one doesn't live
forever, the tracks are constantly changing). Is there a meditation here,
emission or spew that is sourceless except for (in spite of) the corners
or frame of the image? Can one imagine a habitus, inhabitation? Is there a
seeing that moves through memory near and far without the supplication of
the signifier? This is what literally remains to be seen, and brings the
essay to its clothes.

he was in the group; it doesnt exist anymore; bpNichol died in 1988, for
example; this is a very recent 4piece dance work based upon the original
work of The Four Horsemen (actually, predominantly based on the work of
Nichol himself);

the four horsemen were bp Nichol, Steve McCaffery, Paul Dutton, and Rafael
Barreto-Rivera; a Toronto-based group.

http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/4-Horsemen.html

a 1970s sound poetry group that came out of their influence was Owen Sound
(appropriately enough, from Owen Sound, Ontario);

The term "ekphrasis" can be used strictly or loosely,
in a conventional sense or in an outside-the-box
sense--just like the term "poetry." Definitions
evolve.

I've never seen the term "ekphrasis" applied to poetry
which is inspired by, triggered by, derivative of, or
translating other works of literature.  When a poem
assumes the conventions of some other form of
literature (for example, a poem as correspondence to
the editor), I think that a more precise term for that
relationship might be "analogue."

I've seen "ekphrasis" applied to poems which are
inspired by paintings which were inspired by myths,
fables, Biblical stories, historical accounts, etc. In
these cases, the work of visual art is a bridge
between two works of verbal art.

I've also seen "ekphrasis" applied to poems inspired
by visual art but which also reproduce lines written
by other writers. The phrase "with lines by" may
appear in the poem's epigraph.

I know of one instance in which the term  "ekphrasis"
was applied to the relationship between two similar
mediums: film and painting.  An online video presented
a sequence of famous painted portraits, each face of
which flowed seamlessly into the next face. (In my
opinion, though, this is not ekphrasis.)

For the purposes of my blog, I use a rather
traditional, strict defintion--not so much because I'm
a conservative purist on principle, but more because I
need to set limits for the practical management of the
blog and for my own writing.  However, I can be
persuaded to change.

Fascinating and beautiful Alan. I belonged to that world as a kid, with a
subscription to Model Railroader magazine. First learned trompe l'oeil and
how to dream worlds that didn't exist, put my head on the tracks and the
smoke pellets filled the room till they faded into the white painted clouds.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"

Texts commenting on and integrating other texts are decidely not =
involved in ekphrasis.  The examples cited below are interested in =
(among other things) questions of intertextuality, revisitation, and =
reflexivity.  These are not the concerns of ekphrasis, which is all =
about cross-over, specifically the cross-over from arts of rest to those =
of movement (the critical discourse around the mode is rooted in =
Aristotelian distinctions).
=20
Ekphrasis has a very clear and well documented history, with the first =
major example generally identified as Homer's description of Achilles' =
shield in Book 18 of the Iliad (though there are other ekphrastic =
moments earlier in the Iliad and throughout early Greek literature); the =
second important example is Virgil's depiction of the shield of Aeneis =
in the Aeneid.  The mode crops up consistently in the English =
Renaissance and is important to Romanticism (especially Wordsworth's =
"Peele Castle" and Shelley's "On Looking at the Medusa of Leonardo da =
Vinci in the Florentine Gallery").  The first serious theoretical =
consideration is Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's Laokoon, in which he =
ruminates many examples of ekphrasis -- the book taking its title from =
the marble sculpture group representing the events from Book II of the =
Aeneid (Laokoon and his sons being eaten by the serpent).  The =
relationship between the visual arts is often subsequently referred to =
as "the Laokoon problem," maybe most recently by Daniel Albright in =
Untwisting the Serpent.  Williams' series, Pictures from Breughel, is =
important, as are Auden's "The Shield of Achilles" and "Mus=E9e des =
Beaux Arts" (which treats a painting also treated by Williams).  The =
next biggie is Ashbery's "Self-Portrait," and I think the most important =
recent example is Cole Swensen's Try (though Mary Jo Bang's The Eye Like =
a Strange Balloon is a terrific read and teaches very well).
=20
As far as defining the mode, it has been a bit slippery -- with =
significant efforts made in the last half-century by Murray Krieger (in =
his landmark essay, "Ekphrasis and the Still Movement of Poetry: or, =
Laokoon Revisited") and more recently by W. J. T. Mitchell in "Ekphrasis =
and the Other" (from his book, Picture Theory).  James Heffernan's book =
A Museum Made of Words: The Poetics of Ekrphasis from Homer to Ashbery =
is a terrific addition to the conversation, defining ekphrasis as the =
verbal representation of a visual representation (I'm paraphrasing b/c I =
don't have the book in front of me).  I would take issue with his use of =
"representation," but the book is generally very, very good.  There is =
an excellent article on Swensen's Try by Lynn Keller in Contemporary =
Literature, though I don't remember off-hand the date of publication.
=20
All of this is simply to say that there is a large and lively =
conversation surrounding ekphrasis and that both the term and the mode =
it defines are of consistent critical interest -- for reasons suggested =
by both Mitchell's essay and by Carol Jacobs in an essay on the Shelley =
poem.  The discussion always comes back to the same crux -- the =
irresolvable (often productively so) tension between temporal and =
spatial arts.  Temporal arts commenting on one another simply don't =
raise these same questions.  The definition can certainly be altered =
(especially since it has yet to be decided on) -- I think particularly =
with respect to poetry that responds to film, for example.  But if we =
are going to use the term in any meaningful way, we need to be aware of =
its specific history.

Subject: Ekphrastic Defined?



I've looked on the net at several resources and the term ekphrasitc =
seems to refer to cross-medium responses, as in poems on visual art or =
visual art on music, etc. But does it/could it also include responses to =
the work in the same medium (Dan Beachy-Quick's Spell, a book of poems =
that enters into and engages Moby-Dick (and even features autoekphrasis =
- the commenting on the commenting, as it were, with poems in the form =
of correspondence to the editor))?  Or is there another word for this?

yes, all that's right.

i would add it's not solely dance. sound poetry. music. and some very good
visual and animated poetry. the gear they're using for projection is
impressive. i hear the main guy involved in that part of the show has some
dough. the whole stage, both the floor and the back wall, is covered with
animation, at times, quite a large area. and the performers in the midst of
it. quite the writing space.

also there's use of archival footage. of the four horsemen. of richard
kostelanetz talking about intermedia. of bpNichol by himself talking about
poetry.

this piece goes well beyond homage to the four horsemen. though the material
is faithful to the sound poetry and music and visual poetry of the horsemen
and bpNichol.

three of the performers are female. this changes the sound poetry in a
refreshing way. oompa! also, the synthesis of the sound poetry with dance,
theatricality, and sophisticated visuals is well beyond the time and scope
of the horsemen. the performance is, justly, being raved about by theatre
critics as refreshing in contemporary theatre.

i met ellie nichol yesterday. she's moved to victoria. she showed me the
library she has of barrie's work. very large. j.w. curry, who apparently
keeps an up-to-date bibliography of bpNichol's work, has catalogued over
10,000 items and periodically adds more as previously uncatalogued work
comes to light.

Hi all, thought I'd let you know about a new blog I have set up called
that-unsound
http://that-unsound.blogspot.com/ It's a portal for info, writings and
research for the 'sounded' and 'soundings' in language, experimental writing
and new media. I'm interested in correlations between sounded oralities and
the perverse as a possible point of departure for new work/ideas,
particularly in 'women's' experimental/ innovative/ ecriture/ language
frames (that 'allow' just that bit extra).but all work fits under the skirt.
Please feel free to visit.and put the word out. Thank you

Anti-Crystal

Crystal radio apparatus set up in Morgantown, with main inductor coil of
the honeycomb type. A diode and air-capacitor were used; these three
elements constituted the original radio, with the exception of the diode.
The antenna was coupled with a variometer and second air-capacitor, both
old. The antenna was 90 feet long-wire wrapped around two sides of a house
in a hollow. Reception on 1300 from a local station was so dominant that I
attempted at all costs to avoid it, bringing hum and background into play,
with mixed results. The whole was fed into a sound editing program for
further modification. I attempted a democratization of the airwaves,
allowing the power grid and other interferences their say. The result is
at http://www.alansondheim.org/mg1.mov which is a nice sound in a way,
sculpted to be of sufficient interest in itself. This sculpting, like
other aesthetic decisions, interfered with the original intent, but I do
believe such interference constitutes the history of much recent art, if
not certain schools of somewhat machinic poetics. For what is present must
be presence, if presented, there must be a force behind it driving the
efflorescence, there must be intention behind that force or a reading of
that intention, there must be a consciousness behind that reading, there
must be mind behind that consciousness, there must be confluence beyond
that. What is here is confluence, for your listening and your listening
pleasure.

I like these synopses of recent stuff on people's blogs. A good way to find
new blogs that might interest me.

I guess if everyone did it every week, it'd get sort of tedious. But the
occasional catch-up list is nice.

Check out Cole Swensen's "To Writewithiyze" expansive and interesting discussion of writing's ekphrastic interaction with the other arts in American Letters & Commentary 13.

in a conventional sense or in an outside-the-box
sense--just like the term "poetry." Definitions

I've never seen the term "ekphrasis" applied to poetry
which is inspired by, triggered by, derivative of, or
translating other works of literature.  When a poem
assumes the conventions of some other form of
literature (for example, a poem as correspondence to
the editor), I think that a more precise term for that
relationship might be "analogue."

I've seen "ekphrasis" applied to poems which are
inspired by paintings which were inspired by myths,
fables, Biblical stories, historical accounts, etc. In
these cases, the work of visual art is a bridge
between two works of verbal art.

I've also seen "ekphrasis" applied to poems inspired
by visual art but which also reproduce lines written
by other writers. The phrase "with lines by" may
appear in the poem's epigraph.

I know of one instance in which the term  "ekphrasis"
was applied to the relationship between two similar
mediums: film and painting.  An online video presented
a sequence of famous painted portraits, each face of
which flowed seamlessly into the next face. (In my
opinion, though, this is not ekphrasis.)

For the purposes of my blog, I use a rather
traditional, strict defintion--not so much because I'm
a conservative purist on principle, but more because I
need to set limits for the practical management of the
blog and for my own writing.  However, I can be
persuaded to change.

Alan,

In all these images images open to other images in disorienting
perspectives, the frame disappearing. None of these images have frames. That
is what is to me so wonderful about then. One sees the railroad and the
table or the kids surrounding the railroad, etc.

One thing you do not mention -and to me is of the essence of these images-
is that the place itself is the creation of a group of (or a single)
fetichist afficionados, regardless of how much the lungs of the same people
may have been scarred by the historical realities these images capture
(suture?) in its peripheries -on the mind of the onlooker. I think (maybe!)
I understand why you felt as an outsider there, not quite sharing the
fetishistic impulse which paradoxically may have created the place.

Ciao,

Murat

Keat's "Ode on a Grecian Urn" is Ekphrasis in the same way.

A great portion of my own work also tries to use language in a spatial way,
very much interested in this transformation. My essay/poem *The Peripheral
Space of Photography* is a good example. Also, my poem "Steps" tries to fus=
e
multiple verbal fragments using movie aesthetics.

Blogland is a curious land. In one way (for me) it's an incubator from which to throw things up - i.e., in the way of essays- or, as more and more in my case, a way to  explore the relationship between pictures and text (which may be a totally fictional relationship!)   In terms of response, I think there is a world of blog entries that become popular islands unto themselves. Last summer I wrote a piece on "Becoming an Eraser" for Ann Hamilton's Indigo Blue installation at the San Francisco Musuem of Art.(Where I erased a book for 4 hours in a row!) It's constantly visited by 20 to 40 people a week, and often commented on on other 'art sites.'  Ironically I have had no luck placing it with either Art and/or Literary publications where this kind of personal/critical essay does not seem to make a contemporary categorical or  editorial fit. (Where it does 'fit' in the context of blog world).  A photo/comment series on Philip Guston's visual echos in the local street world also
 constantly gets hits.  (Maybe there are just a lot of folks magnetized by both Hamilton and Guston??).

 The most popular entry - that is even "linked" to the History channel - is a quip joke I made about George and Laura Bush getting divorced. It was just a small add on to something I was saying about going to the Zukofsky Conference at Columbia U a (now!) few years back. (Last time I ever saw Creeley - sigh!)
 Normally I would have deleted the joke, but introducing a few thousand people to the name and work of Zukofsky still seems not a bad thing to do.  (A little bait and switch, some may say).

 Now there is Facebook. Many friends/associates invite me to a friend on Facebook. I agree. I even have a Facebook page. I have yet to use any of it, yet. You Tube seems even more tempting.  Take a look at "Hands" on Tom Raworth's site today -  WCW on speed.

thanks for writing
ON THE DEATH OF ROBERT LOWELL
that goes
O, I don't give a shit
He was an old white haired man
Insensate beyond belief and
Filled with much anxiety about his imagined
Pain. Not that I'd know.
I hate fucking wasps.
The guy was a loon.
Signed up for the spring semester at MacLeans
A really lush retreat among pines and
Hippy attendants. Ray Charles also
Once rested there.
So did James Taylor...
The famous, as we know, are nuts.
Take Robert Lowell.
The old white haired coot.
Fucking dead. I found
this one in
Gary Lenhart's THE STAMP OF CLASS:
REFLECTIONS ON POETRY AND SOCIAL CLASS
which he fears is an "undertheorized poem"
a new book page 118

"Randomness has something to do, it seems to me, with the disintegration,
destruction of the ego, which is an essential concept both in Sufism and
perhaps Buddhism. In Sufism, this loss of ego (which , specifically in poe=

leads to Eda, a transformation in the concept of the lyric "I") opens up t=
he
spirit to divine consciousness."

First, I assert that there is no such thing as `divine consciousness=B4. T=

that is described as, for example, `divine consciousness=B4 or `afflatus=B4=

others, is merely a psychological state. It has no connection  to any sort=
 of
divinity because there is no such thing as any kind of divinity.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:
"=B4Divine consciousness=B4 exists because it exists as a concept in

only that the concept itself is an illusion?"

If "=B4divine consciousness=B4 exists ... as a concept in Sufism" then `a =
perpetual
motion machine=B4 exists as a concept in western materialism - but neither=
 one
exists in the real world. To hold that something exists because someone ha=
s
invented a name seems as if it is too postmodern even for a postmodernist.=


If you assert that there is `divine consciousness=B4 in your poems, does t=
hat
make it true, irrespective of any contrary opinion? Is all that is require=
d for an
assertion to be true in your view is that someone asserts it? What do you =
do,
then, with assertions that your opinion is wrong? Aren=B4t those assertion=
s true,
too, for you, simply because they=B4re assertions? But if your assertion i=
s true by
definition, and any contrary assertion is also true by definition, by what=
 means
do you distinguish between them? Or do you? Do you simply choose randomly
among all possible choices? Do you privilege your own assertions over othe=
rs
because they=B4re your own, or Sufi assertions over others because they=B4=
re
Sufi? The notion that any assertion is true is self-refuting since it mean=
s that
assertions contrary to any assertion are also true.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:
"... is `a psychological state=B4 then not merely a concept but something =
more?
How is `a psychological state=B4 more real than `divine consciousness=B4? =
By your
argument there is `a psychological state=B4 but no `divinity=B4? How are t=
hey
different? Pray explain."

If all you=B4re asserting by `divine consciousness=B4 is a `psychological =
state=B4, then
we=B4re merely arguing about terminology, and we have no disagreement that=
 I
can see. But you seem to be using the notion of `more real=B4 here to
distinguish, if I understand it, between `divine consciousness=B4 and
`psychological state=B4 by asserting that the former is in fact `more real=
=B4 than, or
at least `as real=B4 as, the latter. By that I understand you to be claimi=
ng that
there is such a thing in the real world as `divine consciousness=B4, somet=
hing
that is perhaps not as identifiable as `igneous rock=B4 but certainly as
recognizable when one sees it as `pornography=B4.

(On reflection, considering Amy King=B4s propensity to leap to unwarranted=

conclusions about name-calling and insult, I hope no one will take that to=
 be a
disparaging comparison: in the US the Supreme Court has famously ruled
that, while they cannot define `pornography=B4, they are confident that lo=
cal
authorities will `know it when they see it=B4. It is in the category of `k=
now it when
they see it=B4 that I mean to put `divine consciousness=B4 as you use it, =
and
emphatically NOT in the category of `pornography=B4.

(Certainly, though, I intend the comparison to be dismissive of your argum=
ent
(though, once again, Amy King, not of Murat as a person), since I hold tha=
t in
important matters such as pornography and divine consciousness we MUST
be willing to articulate definitions and stand by them at least provisiona=
lly until
better definitions come along. If you cannot define `divine consciouness=B4=
 better
than the Supreme Court defines `pornography=B4 then I hold that your argum=
ent
ought to be dismissed on the same grounds as the Supreme Court=B4s: that i=
t is
inadequate to the seriousness of the discussion. In the case of the Suprem=
e
Court, they have on their side the reason that it is the job of the politi=
cal
process and the lower courts to parse through the definitions, and the SC=B4=
s
job is to choose among those offered. You, however, having brought the
notion of `divine consciousness=B4 to bear on this discussion, have the
responsibility of actually defining your term.)

My understanding of the claims about `divinity=B4 or `divine consciousness=
=B4 is that
they are claims about the supernatural, or at least about the external-to-=
the-
human. As such, they would be different from `psychological states=B4, whi=
ch are
about the internal-to-the-human, and certainly not about the supernatural.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:
"How did you come out with the definition "it is human striving which crea=
tes
art"? To expand on one of your metaphors, human striving might also be a
solution to constipation, but is it art under the circumstances?"

Human striving is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for art. One =
can
have human striving without art, but not art without human striving. No do=
ubt
someone can and will make (or perhaps has made) a piece of art about
constipation - but what makes it art is the artist=B4s striving (even if i=
t is the
relatively facile use of habits and tools, of his or her sensibilities, a =
striving that
succeeds without encountering difficulties the existing set of habits, too=
ls, and
sensibilities cannot deal with), not the striving of the constipated perso=
n. I use
`striving=B4 here as a species of intention. I hold that we cannot get art=
 by
accident. I don=B4t hold that there are no accidents in art, however. It i=
s the
human striving, the intention to make art, that creates art, when it does =
(and
the striving, the intention, is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition=
 for art),
and not the many accidents possible in the process of making art. The
accidents don=B4t make art; the artist does. That the artist may take adva=
ntage
of accidents (there is the famous story of Apelles, Alexander's court pain=
ter,
who got frustrated by his experiments with painting the froth on a horse's=

mouth and in exasperation threw a sponge at his painting, accidentally
producing the effect he wanted, for example), doesn=B4t mean that the acci=
dent
is the art.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:
"Does it mean that if a poem is written easily, it is not an artistic poem=
? Or do
you mean that the subject of art should be about aspiring to something
superior or out of ordinary, provided that abject is not divine; but it ca=
n be
about a psychological state?"

I don=B4t say that art must be about any particular thing; I think art can=
 be made
of anything, but it is made by human beings, not a matter of chance or ran=
dom
occurrences. I also say that chance or random occurrences can be used by a=

human being to make art. Some pieces of art come easy, some come hard, to
individual artists. As JM Whistler said when asked how long it took him to=

paint one of his nocturnes, "A lifetime." Of course no one imagines that t=
he
elapsed time to accomplish the painting was from his birth to the moment h=
e
finished; he was pointing out that the accomplishment of the painting was =
the
result of a lifetime of human engagement with the world.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:
"How come you equate `living entirely in the moment=B4 with being unconsci=
ous
or being like an animal?"

I distinguish the animal=B4s unconscious mind from the human=B4s conscious=

mind. I think that animals have only very limited notions of time, space, =
and
their own existence, and what I know about meditation in the various tradi=
tions
with which I am even a little familiar suggests to me that the goal of suc=
h
meditations is to abandon the human consciousness and its immersion a
world of short- and long-term consequences in favor of the animal
unconsciousness and its lack of understanding of any but short-term
consequences, if there is an understanding of any consequences at all.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:
"Come to think of it, do animals live in the moment? Does one need languag=
e
to say that? When we say an animal does not think of  or know its death, d=
o
we not mean it has no language in relation to us? Doesn't being "conscious=
 of
one's death" by necessity imply the consciousness of deathlessness  - in
other words divinity -- whether such a thing exists or not?"

Yes, I think animals live in the moment and have no understanding of the i=
dea
of their own individual death. It may be that being conscious of one=B4s o=
wn
death implies a consciousness of deathlessness. I=B4m not sure it does, fr=
ankly.
I think it=B4s entirely possible for organisms to struggle to survive with=
out striving
to make art; to have a determination to escape danger, even to recognize t=
he
differences between, say, the dangers of challenging another bull too big =
to be
beaten, and the dangers of challenging the lion at all, and still not have=
 any
awareness of `deathlessness=B4.

But more significantly, it seems to me that the notion of divinity is not =
merely
the notion of the consciousness of deathlessness. The notion of divinity
implies the supernatural. One may imagine deathlessness without requiring
the hypothesis of the supernatural, though I don=B4t imagine that animals =
with
little or no conception of their own deaths can manage either one.

The notion of destruction of ego seems to me to absolutely eliminate the
possibility of any art whatever because it is the human ego, the human
striving, that creates art. It=B4s a necessary but not sufficient conditio=
n. To
eliminate one's humanity in favor of becoming unaware, unconscious, in fav=
or
of living so  entirely in the moment that one has become merely an animal,=

and not an animal who is also human, must of necessity eliminate any human=

capacity for making art.

Subject:      call for work:  sound poetry

<> a s l o n g a s i t t a k e s, a sound poetry magazine published by
the Atlanta Poets Group, is seeking submissions for its inaugural issue.
We are looking for sound poetry, scores for sound poetry and essays on
sound poetry. “What is ‘sound poetry’?” you ask. Good question. It’s one
of those know it when you see (hear) it kind of things. It’s probably
not music (thanks Dick Higgins). It might be noise. If you think about a
spectrum of possible noise made by the human body (or simulations
thereof or substitutions therefor), and at one end of the spectrum is a
person reading her poem and at the other end is abstract noise, we’re
looking for works that incline towards the latter end. We are looking
for works in/of/against the tradition(s) of Ball, Schwitters, Dûfrène,
Henri Chopin, Jandl, Cobbing, The Four Horsemen . . . hopefully by now
you get the idea. We’re looking for stuff that will push/redefine the
limits. The magazine will be Web-based.

Please send sound submissions to aslongasittakes@comcast.net
<mailto:aslongasittakes@comcast.net> in one of the following formats:
.mp3, .wav, .wma, or .flac. Scores or essays as Word documents or .pdfs.
Please query before sending in other formats. If you can’t get us the
work via email, just send an email and let us know, and we can find
another way. We don’t know how long it will take to get back to you on
your submissions, just be cool. We can’t pay you anything for your work.
All work that appears in the magazine will be available for download
from the magazine’s site under the Creative Commons’ /Attribution
Non-commercial Share Alike/ license
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). If you are not
comfortable with making your work available in that way, let us know and
we can probably work something out.

Hi Murat - Actually, I'm not sure of the backgrounds of the people in the
club, but it's in Morgantown, which is a university town, and I think a
fair number may be connected to the university one way or another. They're
also envisioning, both backwards in time of course, but also elsewhere
into a landscape that is somewhat topographically accurate and somewhat
imaginary.

I didn't see the participants as fetishistic in any way; instead it seemed
more of a communality, even community - lots of children and wives (the
builders seemed men) talking about all sorts of things. I thought there
might have been some of the model railroad obsession with the engines
themselves, but people seemed most excited about projects to complete and
where the rails went! Because there were different levels to the models, a
train might disappear into a tunnel and emerge somewhere unexpected. All
of this reminds me of Levy's Hackers, with the description of the MIT
model railroad club...

I could be wrong.  But, from my limited encounters with this word ekphrastic, it means poetry about visual art.  If there are wider meanings to this word, it is new to me.  Because I worked in the Metropolitan Museum for four years, I've written many poems that could be called "ekphrastic", although they were written before I was aware of the word.  Artists whose work has inspired poems by me include but are not limited to Gericault, Barye, Rothko, Rosenquist, and a great tryptich  from the early Renaissance by a Dutch artist whose name escapes me at the moment but which also inspired a poem by Rilke.  I do wish "ekphrastic" weren't such an ugly word for what it represents, however.  Regards, Tom Savage

A great portion of my own work also tries to use language in a spatial way,
very much interested in this transformation. My essay/poem *The Peripheral
Space of Photography* is a good example. Also, my poem "Steps" tries to fuse
multiple verbal fragments using movie aesthetics.

Robert Budde presents a Transparency Machine Event titled "Headwaters:
Ecosophy & Ecopoetics," in Katzman Lounge, University of Windsor, Monday
21 January, 2:30-4:00 PM. That night he will be giving a reading at the
Phog Lounge, 157 University W., 7:00 PM. All welcome to these two free
public events.

Budde's selection of texts and images for his Transparency Machine Event
are available for download from News & Events at
<http://web4.uwindsor.ca/english>.

Robert Budde has published two books of poetry - Catch as Catch (Turnstone
Press, 1994) and traffick (Turnstone, 1999); two novels - Misshapen
(NeWest, 1997) and The Dying Poem (Coach House, 2003); a collection of
poets' interviews - In Muddy Water (J. Gordon Shillingford, 1995); and a
book of short fiction - Flicker (Signature Editions, 2005). Most recently
he edited and introduced a collection of poetry by the late Al Purdy
called The More Easily Kept Illusions (Wilfred Laurier UP, 2006).
Forthcoming are a third novel, Finding Ft. George (Nightwood
Editons/Harbour) and a fourth collection of poetry, declining america
(Book Thug).

The Transparency Machine Event Series invites a poet to talk about his or
her work in the context of other texts selected by the poet. The series
provides a forum (with overhead projector) for discussing the practice and
theory of writing and reading poetry - including practices and theories of
prefixing poetry ("anti-"; "non-"), adjectivizing poetry ("poetic"), and
capitalizing poetry (first letter; letters at random). Poetry
prismatically refracts social, political, scientific, aesthetic languages,
transforming them into something exciting and strange. How does poetic
form do that? This series explores questions about the language of poetry,
offering readers and writers a multi-dimensional experience of the shapes
and sounds of the contemporary moment by inviting leading and emerging
innovative practitioners of the poetry art. Further info,
<lcabri@uwindsor.ca>.

Budde's events are co-sponsored by The Canada Council and the Department
of English Language, Literature, and Creative Writing, University of
Windsor.

'It is time some of you vain babies, who have a 'body beautiful' complex
about your dancing, realize that an expressive body is more beautiful than
an unexpressive one. But no, you fight distorting your body - even the
least bit. If you won't, you won't, but your dancing will be shallow, and
as empty as the baby stare some of you are cultivating.' (Horst)

'I'm not asking you to tie yourself up like a pretzel or grovel on the
floor, but there must be some distortion if you are portraying even a
slight case of mental malajudstment - a little inferiority or martyr
complex.' (Horst)

'You can't drag an analyst's couch out on the stage and tell us about it.
You have to express the mental with your body, so you distort the move-
ment somewhat to externalize.' (Horst)

'All of them died on my red lips
In my hands
In my sexlessness
Which possesses all sexes
I am as pale as moonsilver.' (Anita Berber trans. Gordon)

'In every experience of every objective 'This' by every experiencer the
female differentiating function is necessary, but so too is the male seed
of unity, which supplies 'Being' from the side of the subject, the unitary
consciousness of self from the side of the experiencer.' (Rawson)

'Why are so many boys and girls not erect? Look in almost any school and
you see that many of the pupils, whether sitting or standing, are never
straight. Heads are forward; shoulders double over a little, sometimes a
good deal; chests incline to droop, and grow flat. Fine, full chests, and
an easy, graceful carriage, are rare.

As the pupils get older, these faults, instead of going away, grow worse.

Can this be helped? Is there any way to make a crooked boy or girl
straight? Take a slim, angular boy, for instance, whose father is round-
shoulded and flat-chested--and perhaps his mother, too: can he become
straight, like a soldier?' (Blaikie)

'The same [entity] does not arise from [itself], and how can it arise from
another? Neither does it arise from both [itself and another], and what

'The singularity of specular reflections is demonstrated by the fact that
if one tries to apply to them the schema of a communicational process mamy
puzzling conclusions arise: source and addressee coincide (at least in
cases where a human being looks at him or herself in the mirror), receiver
and transmitter coincide; expression and content coincide since the
content of the reflected image is just the image of a body, not the body
itself; as a matter of fact the referent of a mirror image is pure visual
matter.' (Eco)

The great Dutch landscape painter I was referring to in my earlier post in this discussion of "ekphrastic" is named Patinir.  It's pronounced "pahtineer".  Is anyone else familiar with this painter's works?  I've returned many times to his great tryptich in the Metropolitan but, other than that work, I don't really know what else he painted.  He's considered one of the first great landscape painters in the West although this tryptich is of episodes in the life of a saint.  Saint Jerome, if I remember correctly.Regards, Tom Savage

Therese Broderick wrote: The term "ekphrasis" can be used strictly or loosely,
in a conventional sense or in an outside-the-box
sense--just like the term "poetry." Definitions
evolve.

I've never seen the term "ekphrasis" applied to poetry
which is inspired by, triggered by, derivative of, or
translating other works of literature. When a poem
assumes the conventions of some other form of
literature (for example, a poem as correspondence to
the editor), I think that a more precise term for that
relationship might be "analogue."

I've seen "ekphrasis" applied to poems which are
inspired by paintings which were inspired by myths,
fables, Biblical stories, historical accounts, etc. In
these cases, the work of visual art is a bridge
between two works of verbal art.

I've also seen "ekphrasis" applied to poems inspired
by visual art but which also reproduce lines written
by other writers. The phrase "with lines by" may
appear in the poem's epigraph.

I know of one instance in which the term "ekphrasis"
was applied to the relationship between two similar
mediums: film and painting. An online video presented
a sequence of famous painted portraits, each face of
which flowed seamlessly into the next face. (In my
opinion, though, this is not ekphrasis.)

For the purposes of my blog, I use a rather
traditional, strict defintion--not so much because I'm
a conservative purist on principle, but more because I
need to set limits for the practical management of the
blog and for my own writing. However, I can be
persuaded to change.

Marcus,

I have tried to see where our essential disagreement lies. It seems it does
in our concepts of divinity. For you divinity must be supernatural,
something "outside" the natural. For me, the divine has to do with
consciousness, something intimately related to language. You drastically
distinguish between real and unreal, basically in terms of its human
applicability, its specific technological prowess. The perpetual motion
machine is unreal because it can not be produced and put to economic use.
For me, one the other hand, the idea underlying the perpetual motion engine=
,
something which rejuvenates itself through activity, is real, going beyond
economic application, and is in some way the very definition of spiritual
essence. For me the connection between idea, what is imagined or conceived,
and what is real is much more fluid and cuts across narrowly economic or
practical considerations. This does not mean -as you seem to think- that on=
e
can call anything what one wants or, as you cutely analogize, one knows
pornography when one sees it. Ideas -whether you (Marcus) believe in them o=
r
not- when powerful enough, speaking to a specific group of people, in your
word, to their "aspirations, weave their intricate verbal and ideological
pattern. In that way, they are very real. Post modernism -your slightly
silly hobby horse in these discussions- involves a confrontation with the
realness of the other. It has absolutely nothing to do, as the garden
variety neo conservative seems to think, with the decline of intellectual
standards or deterioration of moral values.

Ciao,

Murat

Alan,

What you say is very interesting. What kind of place is this, a museum or an
arcade? It seems to have elements of both. Also, was the place the creation
of a person or a club (for instance, train schedules or locomotive engine
aficionados) or historians? I could not tell. Obviously, you are reacting to
the political, historical, topographical, etc., associations the images,
perhaps the very place has for you. I also wrote in another place how
photography elicits thoughts in the viewer thoughts which dissolve the
frame, going far beyond the specific "subject matter." In so many of these
photos railroads appear in one frame and disappear in another.

You do mention "the railroad obsession with the engines." And also perhaps
the very specifity of the buildings, the trucks, a specific moment which
they seem to capture as an evanescent tableau, do suggest an aura, a
fetishistic longing. That's why I assumed the original place was the
creation of one person, though I am aware of the kids playing around.

The continuous shifts of perspective is one of the most stunning things
about the images you sent. One always seeing the "railroad" or the hill or
the station, etc., surrounded by something else, for instance, the shelf on
which the mock-up stands or kids playing on the corner, etc., etc. To me one
of the most memorable is the one in which a courtyard and the trucks there
are being looked up from an elevated point. The levation itself suggests a
perspection in which the observed objects are supposed to be seen smaller,
miniaturized. But these objects, one realizes, are already miniatures. This
effect of this double whammy, a visual illusion turning on itself and
spelling it out by referring the conventions of a second illusion, is
breathtaking.

Alan, I am not clear about one thing. The images you yourself posted, are
they replicas of images which were there or are they -with their spaces
cutting against each other- your own photographs of the place? To add
another twist: if they are yours, did you tweak them in any way?

Ciao,

Murat

Subject: eyedrum call for work: 'crop circles, cosmogams, psychogeographies=
'


            Call for material for a visual arts show at
       Eyedrum Art and Music Gallery,  Atlanta,  Georgia.

                    The show will run from
       October 18 through November 29; it will also constitute
          a featured issue similarly titled in
            the online journal PERFORATIONS.

                Deadline: August 1, 2008



         Crop Circles, Cosmograms, Psychogeographies

If nothing else, perhaps it can be said that modernity is about diagrams, s=
chematics, blueprints, Rorschalk cards, flow charts, maps, floorplans and a=
ll the other graphic devices designed to simplify and link the real, materi=
al world with the abstract world of thought and feeling. The same thing mig=
ht be said of the visual arts in general.

The infamous crop circles started mysteriously appearing in the fields of E=
ngland in the mid-Seventies.  Over the past thirty plus years, they have be=
come the source of much speculation, wonderment, hoaxing: were they made by=
 artists? By aliens? By intelligent plasmas? Unknown terrestrial forces? Co=
vert military operations?  As with everything, your answers depended on you=
r proclivities and stations in life.  At the very least, they were beautifu=
l and 'artistic' and SEEMED to be some form of cosmograms, in the same leag=
ue with mandalas, Mayan city constructions, Egyptian mega-constructions, ar=
chaic native American pictographs and other nativistic schematics which see=
med to link an astronomical world above with the terrestrial world below =
=E2=80=A6 and to imbue those diagrams with a purported spiritual power.

All these types of 'ground-based' diagrams also have in common implicit psy=
chological connections with the land even to the point of creating those co=
nnections ex nihilio. The term 'psychogeography' was coined some years ago =
to account for the feeling that the 'beach under the pavement' somehow make=
s itself felt in ideas, feelings, and 'spirits'.

The visual arts show at eyedrum art and music gallery will explore these co=
nnections and forms: What are these forms? Do they have effects and affects=
 or is 'aesthetic' sufficient? Can they be created anew? Does technology fa=
cilitate these 'cosmic figures' and give them new voice or does it kill the=
m off in paving them over and leave us with a dead schematic ... which neve=
rtheless still tries to speak?

There is not much space so please contact the curator if you are interested=
 in participating in the show.

Hi Murat - I'm on a terrible connection. I started to reply at length but
briefly, before it goes off - the place is in the basement of a popular
restaurant here in Morgantown. There are about 26 members of the club,
most of whom I gather are active. We found this out when visiting. The
model is in several sections, and each seems to have 'modules' made by
various members. I was fascinated by the wornout imagery; this definitely
reflects aura, but not fetishization. Instead, the club emphasizes, as
these usually do I think, community, social/charitable events, etc. The
images (they're mine) were completely unmodified, except of course for
size reduction. The model railroad club meets, I think, Thursday evenings,
but I'm not sure whether or not this is every Thursday. I wish I could
tell you more! We may end up going to a meeting to see what it's like.

I think you're right re: the frame; the frame in a sense is arbitrary and
what's of interest is almost off-handedly captured by the exigencies of
taking _this_ image and not another.

The perspective-shifting was amazing, and what held us there for a long
time. And it's a shift not only in space, but of course scale and time;
it's complex, beautiful.

I wonder if the doubling of illusions might not also be related to Eco's
notion of double coding?

Thanks for this! - Alan

i've been thinking a bit about 'code poetry' recently; a piece of mine is
going to be in an issue of wordforword.info including some 'code poetry'.

i think it's good that the term is still wide open. it can apply to the sort
of work mark marino talks about in
http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/codology or to
other types. no one group can really colonize and hold the territory to
themselves, because "code" operates at too many levels and has too many
different relevant meanings in today's world. those who don't know
programming have lots of scope since "code" isn't necessarily executable
programming language or even plain old programming language. "code" doesn't
have to have anything to do with computers at all, for that matter.

perhaps there are some things, though, that most if not all code poetries
are dealing with. the article by søren pold on christophe bruno's work at
http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/textualized is
quite articulate about the big picture:

"...while books are not becoming insignificant or superfluous anytime soon,
we still have a new dominant medium for the organization of knowledge,
culture, and society. Digital literature consequently has a role to play as
a form of media-art that makes us aware of what is happening to text as a
material and concept, to reading and writing, and to the material basis of
text in the ongoing process of digitization, networking, and mediation, and
how these material and formal changes correspond to social and cultural
changes. The concept of text is currently undergoing dramatic changes, and
most text is now produced and read at the networked interface. Text in
contemporary society has become increasingly kinetic, electrified, spatial,
and more or less cybernetically controlled by, for instance,
commercialization in our postmodern urban environment and on the web."

the term "code poetry" is a good one partly because it is open. it isn't a
'school of poetry' made up of a central group. it's poetry that has some
sort of intense engagement with code.

and it opens poetry to types of language and, well, codes, that haven't been
so prominently associated with poetry before.

also, it avoids limiting its focus to computation. it refers as prominently
to matters of language and culture as to computation.

and that's a healthy inclusive broadness.

much as i would like to see a more intense engagement within the art and
poetry worlds with issues concerning the role of programming in art (not
simply programming as a technician's job), it's important to keep the juice
flowing from many areas through poetry, and the term 'code poetry' does that
quite nicely.

the first time i heard the term discussed was by ted warnell on the
webartery list back around 1999 or 2000.

another advantage of the term "code" will emerge in the coming years as we
come to understand more about the way the brain codes and processes
information, i suspect. however it is done, probably it isn't done in what
we think of as 'language'. there is no conscious creator of those codings,
no designer, no consciousness below consciousness in a 'language' of memory,
most likely, but something that is probably better described as 'code'. and
the same probably goes for information and information processing such as
dna: it isn't so well described as 'language' as 'code'.

we are in an intense engagement with 'code', these days, and it deeply
affects language. and we wonder what and if there is a definitive difference
between code and language or whether they bleed into one another as we
ourselves are also part cyber.

so the notion of 'code poetry' is aware of the current and future growing
interface between code and language and this is also the interface between
humanity and machine.

Well, then, we've got merely a quibble about terminology between us, and n=
o
real misunderstanding at all. You are NOT saying that there is any real th=
ing
outside human psychology that is "divine" -- you're merely renaming the
frisson of art "the divine" or "divinity". Your use of "the divine" or "di=
vinity" is,
since you use it casually without a disclaimer, a trifle disingenuous, don=
't you
think? After all, "the divine" and "divinity" have been used traditionally=
 in both
Christianity and Islam to denote the supernatural.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

No, I distinguish between the natural and the supernatural when people sta=
rt
talking about "the divine" or "divinity".

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

No, the perpetual motion machine is unreal because it is, so far as we kno=
w
now, impossible to build in the real world. It has nothing to do with its
economic uses -- it can't be made whether it has economic uses or not: so =
far
as we know now the way reality is made up there can be no perpetual motion=

machine -- not even the whole of the universe is seen as such a thing.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

I don't dispute that we can think of the idea, and that by thinking of the=
 idea we
make the idea "real" in the sense that we can talk about it. But the notio=
n that
by talking about something one has actually done something is what I call
"intellectual's disease". Talking about the plumbing doesn't stop the leak=
;
talking about a perpetual motion machine doesn't create one.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

If the _idea underlying_ the perpetual motion engine, and not that engine
itself, is what you hold is the definition of spiritual essence, then it s=
ounds as if
our disagreement is between The Romantic, you, and The Skeptic, me. You
very much wish that there were a supernatural, but you know there isn't, s=
o
you content yourself with posing on the cliff's edge with your cape blowin=
g
behind you in the approaching storm, fists on hips, one foot thrust forwar=
d,
hair askew (but not too askew to be sexually attractive) in the wind, and =
your

and
hoping that your return, sopping wet and shivering, to your lover will res=

Why doesn't it mean that. It seems that the notion that if the connection
between idea and real is really as fluid as you claim, then the act of cal=
ling one
thing by another thing's name ought to make the one thing into the other t=
hing.
Just how fluid, in other words, do you claim the connection is? If it is n=
ot fluid
enough to make changes simply by renaming, but fluid enough that we cannot=

really name anything without disingenuous mis-uses of terminology to make
specious arguments being seen as valid objections, as in the case of "the
divine" or "divinity" in your hands, then just how fluid IS that connectio=
n, eh?

Just how powerful is "powerful enough", though? That's the crux. In fact,
people can be swayed to genocide by powerful emotional appeals based on
lies. Real lies. Real emotions. Real genocide. We don't disagree that idea=
s
can be powerful enough to change how people view the world culturally -- b=

you seem to be saying, or implying, anyway, that if we just believed hard

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

er.<

No, it doesn't. Postmodernism involves denying that 'Reason', as used in t=
he
Platonic and Kantian traditions, means truth as correspondence, knowledge
as discovery of essence, and morality as obedience to principle, notions t=
he
postmodern wants to deconstruct and deny. There can be no "realness of the=

other" where there can be no truth, no knowledge, no morality, because wha=
t
is "real" about the "other", or even "other" about the "other" if we deny =
reason?

Liberality of mind and critical thought are not, in the postmodern view, m=
atters
of abstractness, but rather of relativity, of alternative perspectives, an=
d all
perspectives are held to be equally valid. The postmodern can privilege no=

perspective over another. Critical thinking become playing off alternative=
s
against one another, rather than playing them off against the criteria of
rationality or reasonableness.

Murat Nemet-Nejat wrote:

It is the postmodern practice to deconstruct "intellectual standards" or "=
moral
values" so that anything anyone calls "intellectual standards" or "moral v=
alues"
are, by the mere naming of them, so. One can only hope that postmodernists=

have the courage of their convictions, and when they contract diseases, th=
ey
will redefine or deconstruct them as a tummy-ache, confident that the mere=

re-naming will mean the problem is solved. Not that there's any chance we
may yet get rid of the postmodernists by holding them to their own, um, er=
,
well, 'standards'. In spite of their purported beliefs that deconstructing=
 "reality"
by talking about it powerfully will 'weave their intricate verbal and ideo=
logical
pattern', postmodernists with access insist on going to hospitals and doct=
ors.
They don't even see the irony, much less the hypocrisy.

Postmodernists are merely the contemporary version of fundamentalist
Christian Scientists, but with advanced degrees and no street smarts. Good=

luck with that.

     "Savinio said he was certain that the the ruins Schliemann excavated
must be those of ancient Troy, because during the First World War the
British destroyer Agamemnon had bombarded them.  If the British sailors had
not been inspired by the unspent fury of Agamemnon, why should they have
fired at ruins in the wilderness?  Names are more than a definition of
things, they are the thing itself."

--Leonardo Sciascia, The Moro Affair  (Alberto Savinio aka Andrea De Chiric=
o
was the brother of the painter Giorgio)

One of the great anxieties of the Pentagon with allowing a few poems to be
translated for inclusion in the published book of Guantanamo Poems was that
poetry by its  very nature is a form of code.  A poetic image even in
translation may still have meaning to a reader from another culture
indicating a meaning concealed to the reader limited to the culture of the
translation only.   The use of non-literary translators was made to
hopefully further distance the original poetic images from their sources, t=
o
further "muddy" and "confuse" their "signals." By making the poems as
"unpoetical" as possible in English, it was hoped that they will also be as
far from their "poetic" origins as possible, in order not to convey any
information of a "secret" or "dangerous" nature to those addressed across
the linguistic divide in the original language.
       "Code poetry," "code writing," and "code speech" have been used from
"time immemorial" to conceal meanings, for reasons of survival, economics,
politics, romance, entertainment, narcotics, any kind of "illicit" activity
one may think of. Graffiti written in plain sight on walls, mail boxes,
subways, buses, telephone poles, that appear to say one thing to the public
say something completely different to those who know how to read their
codes.

        Jim--on the one hand you are saying that computers don't have to do
with the codes and code poetries and aren't colonizing, and then you are
turning to the example quoted below in which the  computers and digital
literature are "the dominant" method of "organization" and
"commercialization."

        With the telegraph there were immediately codes developed--Morse
Code for the transmission of information to do with transportation, stocks,
the news, followed by the stock market ticker.

The development of codes tends to be for purposes of efficiency of
communication, control of communication and secrecy of communication.

       In the digital era these are predicated on the electricity being on.
More than ever in recent genocides and wars the cut off of electricity grid=
s
has become of the utmost importance.   The digital cutoff has meant that
persons have "ceased to exist" within this "inclusive code."  The bombings
of Iraq, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Lebanon were all targeting the electric
grids.    The genocide of Rwanda was preceded by the severing of all
electric, cable, phone lines, in Burma, the protests initiated the digital
cutoff and in Gaza the electric shut down accompanies ever more drastic
measures.  Without electricity, no digital codes, no hospitals functioning,
no water pumps working, no tv etc. Via these means huge areas of the world
are not permitted to enter as it were the 21 st century.

      The interrelationship of poetry with codes was beautifully
demonstrated by Edgar Allan Poe.  Poe ran a newspaper column in which he
challenged all comers to send to him codes which he claimed he would procee=
d
to crack.  And he did.  No one was able to send in one which he he did not
succeed in cracking.  (Though, being Poe, he may have supplied a few of the
codes to be cracked himself!  After all, did he not create the code to
cracked in his story the "The Goldbug" and conceal "the Purloined Letter"
for his detective Dupin to find?)

      Poetry itself is an already  coded language, and language itself is
already the carrier of a myriad linguistic codes and cultural codes and is
inscribed with a myriad myriad human codes, biological, chemical and
neurological codes.  Already with these codes one is aware of the abilities
of humans to create controls, subterfuges, manipulations, camouflages,
forgeries, doublings, all manner of rhetorical devices in the employ of all
manner of purposes.  The idea that new forms of codes will be some how more
open than any previous seems disingenuous.  The first persons to really mak=
e
use of new codes are usually the military, the corporations and the
hackers.

        In Junkie, Burroughs' notes at the end of his Introduction re the
little group of definitions he has given at the back of the book:  "A final
glossary, therefore, cannot be provided for words whose intentions are
fugitive."
       The writer's "Job" for Burroughs is a DIY "fugitive" activity which
is "hidden in plain sight."

       The very language one has used for concealment one now has to learn
to use in order to reveal the things one hopes to convey through the
impenetrability one has become habituated to use as to a cloak worn in a
enshrouding darkness, as "El Hombre Invisible."

     The interface of humanity and the machine one might say has existed
since the very earliest tools, writing implements, fire.  Archimedes
calculator of the grains of sand in the known universe, creator of war
machines for  "Homeland Security;" physics applied to giant catapults.  The
oldest poetry recounts mighty machines used in great battles, arms and
armors of Gilgamesh, Arjuna, the secret code of the Trojan Horse, thousands
of "undeciphered writings" the world over, "objects we know not the use of.=
"

'In all things . . . there is a 'rational' mystery of essences and
correspondences, a tight, uninterrupted network of almost imperceptible,
almost inexpressible significances linking one point to another, one thing
to another, one being to another."
--Sciascia, The Moro Affair

Marcus Bales Wrote:
"You very much wish that there were a supernatural, but you know there
isn't, so
you content yourself with posing on the cliff's edge with your cape blowing
behind you in the approaching storm, fists on hips, one foot thrust forward,
hair askew (but not too askew to be sexually attractive) in the wind, and
your
face molded with determination not to let any real storm spoil your walk,
and
hoping that your return, sopping wet and shivering, to your lover will
result in
your welcome with hot chocolate and open arms."

While i can't accept the terms of what one writer may "wish" as a direct
consequence of a dispute over the terms "natural" and "supernatural"--as I
am very much engaged with the linguistic philosophy that's being worked out
here, though in a limping antagonistic way--I'm certainly in favor of one's
gaining a very practical result of chocolate and some good loving for an
entirely irrational act of standing out on a cliff during a rainstorm.  So,
if I could go on the record for wishing anything, it would be more of these
boundary-walking lovers & hot chocolate chefs.  I'll leave the finer points
of metaphysics and metalinguisitics to the encyclopedia writers and enraged
microscope lens grinders.  Standing in a rainstorm feels good.  Everyone
should try it, cape or no cape.  Take your PDA with you, if you have to.  My
personal wish is for this discussion to take up "sensate" and "insensate" as
possibly mutually opposed terms.

All these angry metaphors are very telling even if they only indicate a
capacity to generate them--whereas I find a good deal of historical, social,
and political information, too. Play on, you clashing civilizations!

If anyone knows of any online classes, correspondence
courses, or conferences on the theory or history of
ekphrasis (yes, it's an ugly word), please post. I'm
already registered for some practical training in the
teaching of "writing from art," so I don't now need
more of that kind of workshop. I'm looking instead for
coursework of deeper substance (short of a PhD
program, that is). I can travel. I'll be at AWP, too.

Sincere thanks.

Hey Marcus, I don't want to butt in over much in this fascinating discussion, but your conception of reason here is overly narrow and it's leading you into a trap in your criticism of the post modern.

Let's take these in order:

"Truth as Correspondence" This is hardly uncontroversial and is denied by deflationary theories of truth (held by ultra non-postmodern thinkers like Frege, Ramsey, Quine, Tarski, and many many others), Coherence Theories of truth (notably held to be the case by a number of positivists, and the thoroughly in the modern camp Leibniz and Spinoza), Pragmatic Theories of truth (Peirce, James, Davidson et al), Semantic theories of truth (Russell, Wittgenstein [sort of], Kripke, Strawson (sort of)). I'm not going to explain all of these theories. Most of them are given pretty good treatments on Wikipedia if you're curious. The point here is that they all deny that "A proposition is true iff. it corresponds to the real," without being in the least bit postmodern.

"Knowledge as discovery of essence" sounds a bit like Ayn Rand and/or her incoherent rendering of Aristotelian biological models as a form of psychological theory, bit I don't really know because I can't ever make sense of the woman. But almost everyone else in the history of western thought, including Plato and Kant, thinks differently on this subject in some way shape or form. Essence is not something that is generally discovered, it is what makes a thing that thing and not something else. As such, it's a metaphysical view, not an epistemological view. Epistemology, from Socrates on down, has been a process not of knowing things, but of explaing how we're justified in thinking that we know something. There are a wide range of views on this point, some of them mirroring theories of truth (there are correspondence, coherence, and pragmatic theories of justification, which, incidentally, don't
necessarily require their truth theoretic correlates. one can be a disquotationalist as regards truth and a coherence theorist as regards justification (as I am.)). But there isn't, that I'm aware of, a distinctly postmodern view of justification. It's a question that has been by and large disregarded as shown to be unimportant by heidegger by most postmodern theorists, which is why most of them say so very little about the issue of knowlege. There is of course the default position of epistemological skepticism, which is largely a bogeyman and not a genuine position defended by anyone, but rather seen as a sort of trap that a viable theory of knowledge has to avoid falling into.

"Morality as obedience to principle" is certainly one view, but it is far from the dominant one outside postmodern theory. For most of history, a Morality as Display of Virtues model was argued for. There have been a number of interesting developments in modern ethics in the 20th century, beginning with GE Moore and stemming through all sorts of different views of what morality means. There are definitely views that Morality is Obedience to Principle, and my own take is a version of that, but there are other ways of looking at things like Agency, Virtue, Right and Wrong, and The Good that are certainly tenable that don't take principles to be primitive. Even if one accepts that adherence to principles is what it means to be moral, there is still the vexed question of how one rationally grounds those principles and what justifies using one principle and not another. Again, lots of thought and
disagreement here on the nonpostmodern theorist side of the fence, while the post-phenomenology crowd largely leave the issue of personal morality alone and focus more on the rightness and wrongness of institutions using a different set of intellectual tools.

This is a strawman and I believe I've called you on it before. I double dog dare you to point me to five postmodern theorists stating that rationality is merely one possible perspective in an infinite field of equally valid alternate perspectives. You can't do it because nobody actually believes this. You're ascribing a weaker position to your opponent than the one that "they" actually hold, attacking it, defeating it (sort of), and claiming victory over them. This is a common bit of sophistry that's codified in all the lists of logical fallacies: your logic is fallacious aka irrational (under one view of rationality at least, and the one that you seem to be espousing) and therefore you aren't measuring up to your own standards. Meaning your argument renders itself moot. Is it possible you're a secret postmodernist merely pretending to be a follower of Alan Sokal?

One hopes if there are such classes, courses, or conferences, that at least
one of them is titled "The Pulchritude of Ekphrasis", just for fun.

Bill Loehfelm is one of the club, or of the gang if you prefer. The story is
well written, the several beginning pages Amazon offers, which sort of makes
you think that it will continue till the end. Why not then? I am pasting the
original message:


Hey y'all,

I have exciting news. My novel Fresh Kills has advanced to the semi-final
round of the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award, meaning I finished in the top
twenty percent  out of over 5,000 entries. The grand prize is a publishing
contract with Penguin, one of the world's leading publishers. Out of the
semi-finalists 100 writers will be selected for the finals.

Here's the critical part: Advancement to the finals will be determined by
reader downloads and reviews for the novel excerpt currently available at a
link I'll post at the end of this message. If the link doesn't work, you can
access the contest page through Amazon's home page. Just scroll down on the
left and you'll find the name of the contest. My novel is entered under
mystery, suspense and thriller. Click that link and I'm on page 6. The
excerpt is available for download and comment until March 2. Throughout the
process, representatives from Penguin and from industry publication
Publishers Weekly will be watching for entrants that get a lot of attention.


This contest is the best opportunity I've had in a while to get my work
significant attention. I beg you to take a few minutes to download the
excerpt (it's free and it's printable), read it, and write a review. I
really need everyone's help on this. I will be forever grateful.

http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00121WDJM

Thanks and wish me luck,

Bill

The Beautiful Throbbed Emanentation


The following is a culmination of certain directions associated with mo-
tion capture - in particular, operating too near and too far from the
receiving antenna, with mixed sensors. In both positions, the configur-
ation generates furious behavior as clusters of sensors shoot to ragged
infinities and back again. Heads may detach and the cartoon integrity
returns as such. The reading, however, is different, as is the jectivity;
the reading is external, jectivity internal. The reading searches for
coherency: which body belongs with which organ? Jectivity follows organ,
head, and limb paths, identification with approaching, consummating,
withdrawing, churning. This is Brownian motion, but radically integral.

So what is being modeled? For one thing, slow-simple movement, carefully
seducing, caressing, antenna and sensor alike. For another, electronic
jitters which threaten to break apart the world.

In all of these instances there are two or three figures; at times, they
duplicate or fall behind or beyond one another; at times they ingest one
another; at times flail uselessly apart; at times, entangle. They cohere
and the video/project/ion is one of cohering, hysteric communality at the
catastrophic limit. Sheave-skins, which are usually reserved for too-close
caress or voyeurism in Second Life, split constantly here; wounds heal,
reopen, the body channels the body. Mind-only emptiness, no mind running
these emanents into the ground.

Violence, abjection, arousal, caress, tumescence, thickening, cutting of
the sheaves. Sheave-figures which I am sure will soon be independent of
our desire or construct.

(This is some of the most advanced video/mocap work I've done; I'm always
amazed that both beauty and wonder can come out of such poverty. It's the
machines which are talking, which are rubbing against one another, which parlay
communication into visionary ekstasis. I must learn, I continue to learn, how
to listen, how to see, what is proffered, what is not within my powers of
conjuration. Magic is magic because it always come from the Other. I have lost
expectation.)

Abjection is the most difficult. How to dis/comfort and fetishize, hold
and release simultaneously. These emanants do this naturally, as Azure
Carter, original model, follows suit.

http://www.alansondheim.org/throbbed.mp4

Abjection is the most difficult, less so as the camera moves in, cuts through
sheaves. For the viewer there is the level of the subterranean bvh code in
dialog with the exigencies of Poser models, but there are also levels of organs
and affect, and it is the breasts and hands, high-speed maternal display, that
provide tremulous scaffolding:

Well, then, we've got merely a quibble about terminology between us, and no
real misunderstanding at all. You are NOT saying that there is any real
thing
outside human psychology that is "divine" -- you're merely renaming the
frisson of art "the divine" or "divinity". Your use of "the divine" or
"divinity" is,
since you use it casually without a disclaimer, a trifle disingenuous, don't
you
think? After all, "the divine" and "divinity" have been used traditionally
in both
Christianity and Islam to denote the supernatural.

In Spinoza, divinity is separated from any connection to providence. That is
to say, the idea of divinity the way I use the term is very much part of the
matrix of Western thought, though in direct opposition, through a critique
to Cartesian dualism with which you, I suspect innocently and completely
unconsciously, are entangled with.

Given your inability to see much beyond your own nose, added to an
irrepressible bad manners to which you seem to be a addicted, this
discussion ends here as far as I am concerned.

David,

Thank you again for making the distinction between codes being a means by
the suppressed of avoiding the eyes of power and the code as a means of
control clear. Of course, in literature, codes are means of escaping
authority. For instance, from what I understand, in Korean literature
surrealist devices were used means of communication avoiding the notice of
the Japanese occupying authorities. The Turkish poet Ece Ayhan used street
slang as a means to reveal (while still hiding) an "invisible" gay and
Armenian and Jewish, etc., culture. In his case, as in his book *Orthodoxie=
s
*, the slang meaning of a word was the very reverse of its official meaning=
.
For instance, "orthodox" officially means Eastern orthodox Christian, holy;
in street slang, it means a hustler. A "drum player" is a gay person.
Ayhan's poetry, on the surface, is full of elusive, disjunctive reference o=
r
images, creating basically a very suggestive puzzle. The poem itself both
hides and reveals the puzzle, embodying the ambivalent struggle of
consciousness to reveal itself in a repressive environment.

Jim, in the idea of code you present, does the code not emphasize the
controlling dimension of code against which, as David points, "the cutting
of electricity" is both a means of escape (eluding the matrix of the code's
panopticon eyes) and painful invisibility?

well here we are, david, talking about it via email.

"code" doesn't necessarily refer to anything to do with computers.

the term "code poetry" could be construed as not necessarily having anything
to do with computers by someone who hadn't read about "code poetry" just as
"modernism" could be construed to be about something contemporary.

i have never heard the poems from guantanomo referred to as "code poetry"
before. but of course you're right that the notion of code is crucial there.
i totally agree.

the term "code poetry" is used to refer to different types of poetry and the
poetry of particular people--it means different things to different people
in the same sort of way that "modernism" is used in all sorts of different
ways.

http://revcom2.portcom.intercom.org.br/index.php/galaxia/article/viewFile/12
52/1023 is a pdf version of a printed mag called galaxia from brazil. this
pdf is from galaxia in 2001. it consists of emails from 2000 from the
webartery list. the emails discuss different notions of "code poetry". this
is the first pub i know of in which "code poetry" was discussed.

it starts out with a post by ted warnell (of http://warnell.com ), part of
which i quote:

"The term ‘code poetry’ goes back a ways. From what I am able to find on the
Web, at AltaVista and the snappy new, totally useful and beautiful (and
FAST) Google.com search engines, the term has long time but limited
definition as:

1) literal, as in poetry realized in Morse Code.
2) literal, as used to convey covert messages in time of war — (there are
several
examples of this — interesting use of poetry).
3) some refer to the ‘art of (digital) programming’, and the resulting
computer
code as ‘poetry’.
4) there are a couple of references, titles of vizpo works, I think, as CODE
POEMS, dating to about 1968.

Found also a single reference by Margie L., at ELO chat archives, which
reference, judging by the context of the conversation, is as we here at webA
are most familiar: a genre of poem/poetics. Also, there are numerous
references here in the webA archives that go to this idea of a genre of
poem/poetics, and in the Glazier Defib. Beyond these, there is little else
on the subject of code poetry. When I think of code poetry, I immediately
think of some of the lively, often spontaneous exchanges that happen
frequently here at webA"

ted mentions the notion of "code poetry" "as used to convey covert messages
in time of war".

but the main thrust of discussion of the term "code poetry", david, i think
it's fair to say it concerns digital poetry.

notice how ted uses the word "literal" in 1, 2, and sort of 3, above.
whereas what he has in mind is not so much a literal notion of "code poetry"
as poetry in which code itself is a concern. possibly a subject. not simply
a communications strategy out of necessity to hide or conceal or simply to
encode, as in morse code.

I think those are all great examples of the continuing relevance of the
notion of "code".

Look at it this way. Other people did things similar to the cutup. But
Burroughs didn't use it as an occassional subterfuge or novelty. He
developed a whole poetics and philosophy in which cutup was crucial. His
concern with cutup and disjunction was very deep and insightful, not simply
occassional. Similarly, the notion of "code poetry", as formulated by some
digital poets, is involved with code at a deeper level, artistic level,
social level.

Alan,

Did you see the movie The Station Master? In that movie also there is a club
where all meet and watch films of trains moving in rapt attention, just
moving? The main character, who is a dwarf, loves trains, their schedules,
takes walks on the rail lines. I wander if on some level the miniaturization
in the mock ups in the Morganton figures -and your photos of them- the
importance of that miniaturization in all sorts of way and the main
character in the movie being a dwarf connect in an important way? What is
real?

Trains of an earlier generation -which both Morganton images and the trains
in The Station Master reflect- contained an element of duration which
contemporary/bullet trains do not. Things happened in those trains. Murders
were committed, people met, spies intrigued against each other, at their
departures lovers got separated, wives left behind during the war waited for
their soldier husbands, often of the defeated army, to return. Stations were
built as contamporaneous palaces. Can you imagine the same mythical aura
-what Walter Benjamin assigns to the "new" technologies of our childhood
("wornout images?") as a dialectic, analytic dream of history- existing
around a bullet train? The images of your Morgantown photos have a similar
duration. The function of the place is problematic, not exactly a symbol or
a fetish; but simply there, basically at least to us, a found object a la
David. This ambiguous use creates duration, thickens, substantiates the
empty areas.problematizes perspective.

When you write, "the images (they're mine) were completely unmodified,
except of course for
size reduction," what do you mean? I assume you took the photographs? How
did the "size reduction" occur? I am not clear.

"I think you're right re: the frame; the frame in a sense is arbitrary and
what's of interest is almost off-handedly captured by the exigencies of
taking _this_ image and not another."

Do you mean the "facts," the object in front of the lens dictates the
photograph? Do you understand what I mean by the independence of "gesture"
-of what is before the lens- creates the photograph, despite all the
manipulative impulses of the photographer? This democratic/chaotic impulse
inherent in photography as a medium?

"The perspective-shifting was amazing, and what held us there for a long
time. And it's a shift not only in space, but of course scale and time;
it's complex, beautiful."

Exactly. That's what I mean by duration anjd the unsettling substatiation
the space of the photograph undergoes.

"I wonder if the doubling of illusions might not also be related to Eco's
notion of double coding?"

I had not heard of Eco's phrase, but truly a double encoding creating a
mental pun occurs: the code of the miniature object encounters the code of
the perspective. Therefore, those images taken from above are doubly small
which, ironically, make them more "real," gaining for an instant in the mind
the dimensions of their non-photographic size.

Come to think of it, there is a third encoding, that of photography itself,
which seemingly (only seemingly) miniaturizes the subject into a smaller
frame, a frame which itself dissolves.

Ciao,

Murat

It is the postmodernist conception of reason (and truth, knowledge, and
morality) that is overly narrow, I think -- the postmodern reaction to a narrow
view of what postmodernists consider the dominant mode is why
postmodernism seems so silly, I think. I am not asserting that the kind of
reason (and truth, knowledge, and morality) postmodernism is reacting
against is my preferred sort; I'm saying that that is what postmodernism is
reacting against in its silly way.

Thanks for your review of types of truth, knowledge, and morality, though.

Well, there's Rorty, of course, and Foucault. And let's see ... Derrida no doubt,
and Stanley Fish along with Merleau-Ponty. Is that five? Well, maybe with
postmodern counting it's seven or three, since anything is what anyone
asserts it is within this strange world view. And of course there can be no
straw men in postmodernism because everything is whatever one asserts it is.

But of course you're right that none of them would test gravity by leaping out a
20 story window -- they may be academic postmodernists but they're not
complete fools. They also go to doctors when they're ill, obey the traffic laws,
and pay their taxes. But that is the point, isn't it -- that they stake out an
extreme position in intellectual terms, if one wants laughingly to call it that,
that they do not care to test in the real world.

The postmodern view of the world seems to be largely composed of trying to
see every individual thing, person, culture, what have you, as a series of black
boxes, all equal, all mysterious in their self-sufficiency, and with nothing to
choose among them except the accident of birth, and even that questionable.
It's not so much that postmodernists have any theories about truth, justice,
beauty, or proportion, or knowledge or morality either, so much as that they
accept all theories indiscriminately. It's all relative, and it's all uncertain -- and
they know that because they've heard that Einstein and Heisenberg said so.

I don't advocate that such folks must hold to this or that theory of truth,
knowledge, morality, justice, beauty, or proportion -- but I think it would do
them a world of good to have to do their own home and auto repairs so they
have to learn at least some practical science, instead of imagining that how to
operate the lock to a house or car is all you have to know about the thing
itself.

Andrei Codrescu is the author of New Orleans, Mon Amour: Twenty Years of Wri=
ting from the City, a collection in response to the catastrophe that devasta=
ted his adopted city in 2005. In 1989 he returned to his native Romania to c=
over the collapse of a catastrophic history and wrote The Hole in the Flag:=20=
An Exile's Tale of Return and Revolution. History is explored playfully in a=
 book-length interview called Miracle and Catastrophe: an interview with And=
rei Codrescu by Robert Lazu, published in Romania by Hartmann publishers in=20=
2005. Otherwise, he has no interest in catastrophe, which is why he comes to=
 New York only twice a year.=20

Codrescu's other books are more about miracles, really. They include: Wakefi=
eld, a novel; It Was Today: New Poems; Casanova in Bohemia; Alien Candor: Se=
lected Poems 1970-1997; The Blood Countess; Messiah; Ay, Cuba: a Socio-Eroti=
c Journey and Hail, Babylon: Looking at American Cities. For more info, visi=

Sharon Mesmer (aka Annoying Diabetic Bitch) has been active in the New York=20=

on=E2=80=99t tell you when.) Known as a poet and performance artist, she=E2=
=80=99s performed internationally, especially as a founding member of the Me=
llow Freakin' Woodies band. Among her poetry collections are Half Angel/ Hal=
f Lunch and Lonely Tylenol, an art-poetry collaboration with David Humphrey.=

There are scenic overlooks in my county, if not cliffs qua cliffs. I'm
just sayin' that if some poet did this at me in order to be sopping,
romantic, and poetic, I would not only fix hot chocolate, I would also
bake cookies.

Dear Jim and Murat--

(I added on after this part of a Burroughs note i sent last week as i think
it got lost in the shuffle and it relates with some of this)


I looked up "code poetry" and there are 443,000 listings so it is  literally
a "going concern" complete with ads for t-shirts and logos and lesson books,
programs, web sites und so weider--

When we were 12 my friend Sergio and i, to make school more interesting,
invented a "secret society" called SHAM--"Secret Horrible And
Mysterious"--we made up codes and planted all over the school messages and
signs in them, some elaborately hidden, some in plain sight--no one ever
caught on--we never were sure if this meant we had succeeded or in some way
had failed--on the one hand we were indeed secret and mysterious--but if
unknown to such a degree--were we at all able to be horrible?

      I find it still a fascinating, time traveling  code that Savinio sees
in the "proof" of Schliemann's Troy being revealed by its shelling by a
First World War British ship named Agamemnon.  (This is the kind of incident
that Burroughs worked to find with his cut-ups among his notebooks, his
creations of time travel.)  That the majority of persons will miss this code
and instead read the scene simply as a British warship shelling a bunch of
ruins in Turkey has a parallel in the reception of Savinio's own work.  As
Leonardo Sciascia writes:  "But who in Italy has read his works, despite the
optimistic reissue of some them in recent years?  Savinino himself, speaking
of foolish and mediocre readers would say:  "But are there among Savinio's
readers fools and mediocrities?"  Not a question, but an assertion; he was
sure there were none."

     Sciascia uses this example as an aside to demonstrate an event that
occurs in his search for a possible solution to an enigma, the disappearance
in 1938 of the Italian nuclear physicist Ettore Majorana.  (Rememeber this
is an Italian story--): A person who gives information to a person who
supplies a corraboration for Sciascia that Majorana, who it is supposed knew
before anyone else the secret of the A-Bomb, and may have sought refuge in a
monastery, supplies also the information that it is rumored that one of the
members of the crew of the bomber that dropped the A-Bomb on Hiroshima had
also gone to the same monastery for a while.

        I wrote a while ago here re the baseball player, spy and radio star
Moe Berg and  the Hiroshima Bomb, Jack Spicer and Yasusada.  Organized a
bit, the writing is now called "Before Curveball."  "Curveball" himself now
features in a piece leading up to and including   the Guantanamo Poems, as
"Curveball" is  the code name for the Iraqi informer whose fake information
was used as "solid evidence" which was presented complete with models to the
UN by Colin Powell for the War in Iraq.  "Curveball" threw a "curveball" all
right, with as disastrous effects as the spying of Moe Berg.  These bizarre
baseball connections thus link two American wars and the poetries connected
with them by their own strange routes.

         These create a code which one finds as one goes along--
         I think this finding of codes is different from the programming of
them--


                 In the Guantanamo Poems what i think makes them a very
important event is that they are the first book of a new form of what i for
now call the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry.  The breakdown of the
ego, the personality, of the detainee through prolonged periods of sleep
deprivation, alternations of extreme heat and extreme cold, beatings,
electro-shocks, waterboardings, light deprivations, prolonged light
exposures, solitary confinements, prolonged exposures to extremely loud
music and white noise--all of these techniques to destroy as much as
possible the person and their memories, erase them as much as possible as
any kind of human with any kind of culture and at the same time force them
to speak, all of this creates a new kind of "poet." and "poetics."  This
"poet's" work is for the most part censored out of fear it may contain
"coded messages," and what is allowed to be presented must be passed through
a form of "non-literary" translation which greatly resembles some of the
techniques advocated in the "List of Writing Experiments" of Charles
Bernstein.   We now have an "electrified" and "recoded" and "experimentally
translated" as it were "body of work" produced under the watchful eyes of
the ultimate American Panopticon, the extra-legal Guantanamo.
         The Guantanamo Poems weren't very well received of course.  "A
product of the Pentagon, " "bad poetry in non-literary translations," "I
won't read it," all the bad reviews plus Robert Pinsky's noting "no
Mandelstams here."  What a relief!! God forbid there had been a Mandelstam
there!  But the beauty of the New Extreme Experimental Poetry is that it
ensures the production of the poetry of "The Shock Doctrine" as Naomi Klein
calls it. This electro-schock poetry is the opposite of the "Projections" of
Jenny Holzer, which go hand in hand with the writings and figure and
institutions and receptions of Power.  The electro-shock poetry is to prove
how incredibly impoverished and pathetic culturally the "terrorist,"
"Islamo-Fascist" "enemy-combatant" really is. The "Projections" prove how
incredibly "free" and "good" and "critical" and "appreciative of good
poetry" "we" are.
      This battle of the electricities --the Electricity of Illumination and
"Projections" and the Electricity of Shock and Prisons--is an "update" of
the "electric code" war between Westinghouse and Edison in the latter part
of the 19th Century.  Though he was  neither pro nor con the death penalty
nor the use of electricity for it, Edison became an (elaborately
underhanded) advocate of the use of A/C current over hanging and the
guillotine as a method of dispatching those judged deserving.  A/C was the
product of his rival Westinghouse--Edison supported this in order to further
the public image of his D/C current as the "Safe" one.  Westinghouse would
be the Bringer of Death, the Shock Doctrine, the Prison coded  Electric
Chair Provider, the  Power Behind Old Sparky's Throne,  and Edison the
benevolent "Projections," and electric light bulb provider.  "Let there be
light" as opposed to "let there be be the dark hood."  So the "battle of the
codes" as a "Light" and "Death" matter is inscribed in the history of
electricity itself.


(actually i remember in the early 1970's my father mentioning something
about computers that were writing poetry--
i remember asking him if computer poems followed the linguistics of human
languages or a "linguistics" of binaries--or might even somehow involve more
complex formulae--
or weren't many formulae in themselves poetry in their condensed
"perfection"--
moe berg, the A-Bomb-Heisenberg-Mickey Mantle--Ezra Pound--all play a part
in this area of things)


Murat I thoroughly enjoy and know this of language you write of.  It's in
the Burroughs quote I used re a glossary of a language whose intentions are
fugitive and in a lot of poetry in cultures the world round.  Chaucer and
Villon spring to mind, for example.  Often, where i live, we have
conversations using words which sound like "normal everyday words" to an
outsider" but to us have a completely different meaning.  I'ts the art of
speaking night thoughts in broad daylight. The language of the "world within
the world."  A friend was visiting one day and listened to us having a
conversation for about ten minutes.  Later he remarked what a pleasant event
it seemed we had been talking about and what a nice time we must have had.
Actually we were discussing a body found laid out neatly as a sign beside a
dumpster kitty corner to here, shot execution style, to differentiate it
from a guy shot the other day in the street not as an execution.  I saw that
event when going to buy cigarettes, about forty feet away from me.  And only
from the back.  And only in code, so to speak.  We had also been discussing
the rise in price of cigarettes and bus tickets.  All of it impenetrable to
my friend, and just as well.

        Actually one could say that "code is the subject" of itself in such
works as Illuminated Manuscripts and examples such as the Alhambra.  The
calligraphies and images which are within the lettering and borders of
illuminated Manuscripts contain further meanings which are forms of codes
both "a part of" and "apart from" in a supplementary sense.  In the
Alhambra, the caligraphies are both written texts and mathematical formulae,
there is a doubling carrying of codes.  Reading some of the examples in the
journal noted, what one finds is not that he ideas are new, but simply that
the medium being used is different.  Long before Morse code poems for
example, there were semaphore poems, made by the international codes using
flags from ship to ship or hill to hill--I imagine many smoke signal poems
and also mirror flashing poems among messages transmitted at a distance by
these, let alone carrier pigeon poems, the first Air Mail Art being borne
aloft in this manner also.

      "A poem can be made of anything" as WC Williams wrote.  One could take
the junk on this table and arrange it a myriad ways as poems, or take a
bunch of identical plates or cups out of a cupboard and arrange them in
various patterns as "lines", with spacings suggestive of "pauses" and
"accents" and "volumes."

      Murat and I are interested in the ways in which language camouflages
an identity  so that it may appear to "assimilate" for reasons of survival,
as well as means of resistance.  Codes at one level have to do with "value"
in terms of the "status" of the "object"--for example bar codes and ISBN
numbers.  In the computer information world, codes such as these are shifted
on to persons in as many ways as there are codes for determining angles of
value determination.  New forms of camouflaging and resisting will be
developed just as quickly as new methods of "identifying" and "profiling"
are.
     As the then Soviets and now Americans are discovering in Afghanistan,
their seeming complete superiority in technology and communications over the
Afghans was and is routinely  undermined by a communications system based on
the delivery of messages by runners, the most ancient of methods.

       For over a decade now my visual poetry, mail art etc has been made
with found materials and at one point I had the ironic and hilarious
experience of receiving a Mail Art journal with an essay I had written on my
Street sources while I was  as it were removed from the streets for a
period, and learning how to find materials in the most limited situations.
Making do for long periods without email or even a phone, tv and ignoring
the radio.

  I think what one learns from this experience is that the world is as yet
unread and unwritten in so many ways because in a sense persons have been
losing an ability to read and write independently in many ways due to the
dependence on the codes via being plugged into machines ultimately
controlled by others.

    The kind of skepticism Murat and I have towards this embrace of codes is
that all too often codes are applied to persons, and persons have to in turn
decode and recode the codes in order to both survive and resist.  Poetry is
a gathering together of many strange elements which peculiarly enough  are
named among the living, as actualites, as Savino demonstrated, and in turn,
using his example, is not Troy located in Turkey and Murat from Turkey?  And
I am writing from Milwaukee, which is where I met Murat?

Are we "secret agents" of "another code"--"double agents"--"foreign
agents"--

           In the immediate world are already the codes spoken which are at
once both "obvious words" and "secret," the "proof of Troy," the "New
Extreme Experimental American Poetry" in which Curveball and Moe Berg play a
part, along with Thomas Edison and Westinghouse, Naomi Klein and Savinio,
Sciasia, the Italian Letter, forgeries, Emily Dickinson and car bombings,
Roberto Bolano and 9/11 and much much else.


here's part of the Burroughs--

       Burroughs' cut-ups, unlike the productions of the machines online
that one can use to do cut-ups as though "not by oneself," are methods of
making a "minority of one" which via camouflages, masks, "being obvious,"
essays survival as an intact writer. "The Death of the Author" so beloved of
Authors, for this kind of writer has already been experienced near-literally
and figuratively; what remains is the desire to live, go on living as a
writer--and so the camouflages, disguises, masks, "role playing" and
heteronyms, "alter egos."

In Burrogghs' cut-ups--the cut-up uses texts to reveal  the synchronicities
and correspondences which exist among them, which in turn give evidences of
the "plot," the "conspiracy" going on and conducted by Language As Control.
The cutting up is to reveal the inner anatomy so to speak of the bodies of
the Monsters, the Mobsters of the Nova Mob and their spreading
virus-word-conspiracy.

The "consciousness"  "outside oneself," which one "lets in" via "destruction
of the ego" through randomness--on the one hand may be "cosmic, the
universe,"--"a power greater than ourselves"--or it may be Control--the Nova
Mob, Big Brother, "His Master's Voice" as was the old the RCA Victor record
label's image of the dog listening to the giant flower of the Victrola's
"speaker."

Burroughs as he noted in the Introduction to Queer--thought of himself as
being of the Middle Ages in his thinking regarding "psychology."  (He had
after all studied for a year in Vienna after graduating from Harvard.)  It
is NOT the "ego" which one wants to get away from but the forces outside one
which try to destroy one's being, take control of it and use it for their
purposes.  The writer's activity is a guerrilla one against being turned
into a passive, consenting, or unwitting accomplice in the vast complicities
with the conspiracies of  Control.

In the Introduction to the first edition of Junkie, which is reprinted in
later printings, Burroughs notes of the little glossary of street/drug terms
at the back of the book:  "Therefore a final glossary cannot be made of
words whose intentions are fugitive."

The writer is at once the detective and the outlaw--an agent "posing" inside
the imposed "seemingly random" cover of Control.  The secret agent/intrepid
reporter/private investigator/"Inspector Lee" is ceaselessly at work to
dismantle and discover, uncover, recover "evidence" to be used  not simply
for "cutting up" but--as Burroughs makes clear--arranging, editing, creating
the "Files" which make use of the juxtapositions of words, images,
memories,dreams, fictions and facts, so  as to be making an ongoing
"fugitive" language which at once perceives and deceives Control.

the writer is not attempting to become "ego-less"--but a series of
"identities" which are 'disguises" and "camouflages" such that the writer
becomes "El Hombre Invisible" as one of Burroughs' own sobriquets "pictured"
him.  The writer participates in a series of anonymous, heteronymous,
pseudonymous and invented personas" parts," "roles," "charcters."   This is
not to destroy the "identity" of the writer at the core, but to preserve the
writer in order to continue writing for writing is the means of survival in
a world in which both the "seemingly random" and the "obvious' are bent on
maintaining their control over one.

The great Jazz musician Don Cherry used to very often say--"Free Jazz can
only be played by superbly disciplined musicians."  Burroughs' years of work
with the cut ups in texts, images, sound recordings, film--this has
affinities with Rimbaud's "long reasoned derangement of the senses" in order
to arrive at the Unknown," which for Burroughs is the being always a step
ahead of the Control, of Language.  For Burroughs this to make possible not
only travel in space, but travel in time for the writer.

Burroughs was always precise on the point that no work was done when he was
using drugs.  Drugs are Control which wipes out the writer. Tabula rasa.
Having been a long term addict like Burroughs, it was only after one gets
away from that Control, that one enters writing--and why writing is very
different from  becoming "outside" to oneself--it is the means to find a way
to exist as oneself--to survive--what one knows of the Forces of Control.
It is that necessity of survival  the necessity that is the motherfucker of
invention that is involved with the fugitive, "outlaw," "outsider" aspect of
writing, the need for the "undercover" aspects, and the reason why so much
that one finds around does not appear to one as it does to others. It is too
see what is hidden in plain site/sight/cite and at the same time see how
many things that "seem" to be  "liberating" are disguised traps, or inside
out reflections of what they purport to be the opposite of, in opposition
to.  Often the concept of "opposition" itself can be used as a diversion
from what is the overall issue of Control and an essay at understanding and
recognising as much as possible its manifestations.

An aspect of this is the breaking down seemingly of voices in which Jim
notes  "all characters seem to be one."    The key is that they "seem" to be
"one."  From the point of view of the writer, they are not one, but many,
and constitute a swarm.  The swarm is camouflaged by this "seeming" to be
one--if it is simply "one" then it can be easily crushed.  The multiple
"identities" of the writer creates such a swarm, a way of continually being
"a minority of one" "on the move"  whose "intentions are fugitive"--a
"minority of one" whose intentions are to appear now as "one," now as
"another," and in turn as a swarm which may appear to the eyes of Control as
"one."

Kurt Schwitters is one of the truly profound "cut-up" artists--and his
collage "method" was to use what he found in the street.  Again, Picasso's
"I do not seek, I find."  This is Burroughs' method in the cut-ups--he used
the found texts of newspapers, things found in the street, passages found in
his favorite writers, in turn collaging these edited cut-ups, which he put
through many transumuttations of his own cutting and pasting by hand--and
the n arranging--along side the passages from his dream journals, and others
from the memories which were stimulated in turn by the collaged cut-ups and
dreams and fictions, poetry of other writers.  This for
Burroughsconstitutes the writer's method of time travel--to be able to
travel among
memory, dream, imagined places and persons, factually recorded ones known
and unknown to the writers and so create extensions of fugitive

As Burroughs writes in the Intro to Queer--writing is for him a matter of
life and death.  On the day that he shot his wife, he feels that the forces
"outside" were in Control, and the use of drugs was the allowing of Control
to reduce him to zombie sitting on the edge of his bed staring at his foot
for what was a period in which time is "junk time" only measured by the
drops from the syringe, the injected transfusions of Control.

The Carny world, the hustlers, the small time dope peddlers, snitches,
thieves, punks and assorted "low life" and "criminal" doctors, scientists
etc that populate Burroughs' universe are his verison in a sense of the
Medieval Carnival, in which the masks fall away and the Emperor really has
no clothes, Death walks nonchalantly in broad daylight, the Sins come out to
play, and the monstrous buffoons that are the forces of Order are for a day
or a few truly Buffoons.  That is the meaning of "Naked Lunch"--the title
from Kerouac's saying that it was the moment when indeed what was on the
forks was seen for what it is--not unlike the scene of The Last Supper in
Bunuel's Viridiana, the Feast of the the deformed, the degenerate, the
diseased and their having their "picture taken" by a woman facing them who
lifts her dress up to bare her "camera eye" as the "recorder" of
"posterity"  that "degrades"not only the Last Supper, but particularly its
representations.  In a sense, this method destroys not what is the Last
Supper itself but the use of its representations as methods of Control  The
woman's "camera" image "exposes" the degeneration and diseased ("Word
Virus") "state of the image" and "image of the state" as a "rotting
edifice".  (A leper--literally a "rotting one,"  plays prominent part in all
of this, including the violating of Viridiana, the former Nun now a secular
"doer of good."  Among the "rotting edifices" of the film is Franco's
Spain--this is 1961--where "miraculously Bunuel made this, one of his finest
works.)

"Look at it this way," so to speak.  A reporter does not necessarily become
"more objective" and "less present"  via self-censorship and editing, but
more representative of the point of view of the "editorial board" which in
turn is accountable to the "board of directors" and they are accountable to
the ultimate holders of the accounts--the advertisers whose payments for
Space enable the "reporting" to exist as an extension of their "ideology, "
their efforts at Control.  (Burroughs' grandfather was Ivy Lee, one of the
first great "Image Makers," who created John D. Rockefller's image and whom
Hitler was intersted in hiring.)

 This is why really good reporters are so often running afoul of the papers
who employ them, let alone governments, state espionage agencies,
authorities of al sorts whom they are "investigating" and "reporting on."
The rise of infotainment and the increasing employment of huge
corporate-state-intlligence-connected "news media" and "translators" like
teh sinister  MEMRI which controls the Ameircan media's news and
translations from the Middle East and uses disinformation, planted stories,
dis-translations regularly) are bent on destroying the actual existence of
the reporter who does not want to "lose their ego" or "their own writing" to
a bunch of special interest groups, governments, corporations, infotainments
and "think tank consortiums."

The high death toll of reporters and photo journalists, media persons, in
war times and ones engaged in trying to investigate drug cartels,
gangsterism, corporate frauds is for this reason.  The reporter will not let
go of that "minority of one" standpoint which is the necessity  of someone
actually attempting to understand and "report" what is going on, outside of
the Control as much as it is possible, which is very hard when from al sides
one is a target.

The same might be said of using machines which are produced by companies for
the production of "randomness"and "cut-ups."  Why "take them on faith," for
one's "search" to "get outside oneself?"  It might be not so much a "loss of
ego" as a "liberation" but the surrendering of "oneself" to the corporate
machine and becoming another cog in the wheel of the a mass production of
texts "reflecting" the "point of view' of that particular company's
conception of "randomness" and "cut-ups."

If one has an awareness of the "fugitive intentions" of language--for
"one's own survival"--in turn causes one makes this demand, this need for
the examination of all language, for the "fugitive intentions" of Control.
In a society which so "values" such phrases  as "the bottom line," and "the
buck stops here" (yeah right--) and prints "In God We Trust" on its money,
along with the phrase "E Pluribus Unum" which can be interpreted many ways,
not al of them "good," is not the "bottom line" to put "trust" in Trusts?
"trust me, man," says the smiling dope dealer, the used car salesperson, the
voice of the "Con Inside" inserted there from the time of birth.  Trust me
says the smiling politician--and the smiling Opponent, the Opposition.
"Trust me, believe in me, obey me, love me."

The basic idea of much of the thinking of Control is this--to get persons to
live, work and think in ways which are against their  "own best interest"
and as much as possible in the "best interests" of Control.

The mystical aspect of the found which Murat notes i wrote of a few days ago
and this is often involved in my own work.  There is also this Burroughsian
aspect of a writing which wants to live, by the means which necessity gives
it, and not, as much as this is possible, by "taking signs as wonders."

Introductory Poetry Workshop=8B Frank Lima
Tuesdays At 7pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 13

This workshop will engage you with poems of the New York School, in additio=
n
to some South American poets such as Neruda and Vallejo. You=B9ll receive
weekly writing assignments that aim to expand your range and encourage you
to take chances, from writing sestinas to more contemporary approaches.
Vigorous attention will be placed on editing your poems. Guest poets will
visit the workshop from time to time to discuss their work.

Frank Lima was born in New York and studied with both Kenneth Koch and Fran=
k
O=B9Hara. He is the author of Inventory, among other titles, and has written
two opera librettos.


Poetry And The Visual Arts =AD Vincent Katz
Thursdays At 7pm: 5 Sessions Begin February 14

Poetry has had a long and fruitful symbiosis with the visual arts; this
workshop will examine some of the relationships and ways that a deeper
understanding of the visual arts can enhance one's writing and understandin=
g
of poetry. We will look at collaborations between visual artists and poets,
the effect of the visual on modern and contemporary poets, and Pound's
division of logopoeia/melopoeia/phanopoeia and phanopoeia's possible
meanings. Poets who have worked as art critics and poets who have been aliv=
e
to visual art's stimulations whose work we will discuss include Baudelaire,
Apollinaire, Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Robert Creeley, Ron Padgett, Anne
Waldman, Bill Berkson, Ted Berrigan, Joe Brainard, Eileen Myles, John Yau,
and Carter Ratcliff.

Vincent Katz is a poet, translator, art critic, editor, and curator. He is
the author of nine books of poetry, including Understanding Objects.

Know Your Place: Experiments In The Eco-Sphere =AD Lisa Jarnot
Fridays At 7pm: 10 Sessions Begin February 15th
What is or what can be a writer's relation to space and place? In what ways
are ecology and environment intrinsic to creative awareness beyond the
stereotypes of mytho-poetic tree worship? How does one transform the
particular flora, fauna, and detritus of the domestic into vibrant art?
These are the questions we'll ask as we plot a course deep into our own
"environments". Weekly readings will be complemented with exercises,
experiments, and on-site writing. We'll move through Zukofsky's New York,
Olson's Gloucester, Allen Ginsberg's apartment, Hannah Weiner's sink,
Berrigan's Cranston Near the City Line, Juliana Spahr's Dole Street, and
C.S. Giscombe's Giscome Road.

Lisa Jarnot's fourth book of poems, Night Scenes, is forthcoming from Flood
Editions in early 2008. She has taught at Naropa, Bard College, Wesleyan
University, and Brooklyn College.


The Poet In The Library: Research And Imaginative Writing =AD Jill Magi
Saturdays At Noon: 10 Sessions Begin February 16th
Is there a role for research in imaginative or creative writing projects?
Sure! In this workshop we=B9ll combine prior knowledge with curiosity,
creating opportunities to =B3stumble upon=B2 interesting language and images.
We=B9ll develop research questions to accompany our intuitive and imaginative
writings; search for materials in books, historical documents, articles,
newspapers; take field trips to public archives, libraries, and historical
sites; experiment with using found text; explore ways to structure a long
poem, including the possibility of creating a hybrid text, and a text that
includes visuals. All along, we=B9ll take a look at works by Susan Howe, Gale
Jackson, Claudia Rankine, Juliana Spahr, and others, and the visual/text
work of Mary Kelly, Lorna Simpson, The Atlas Group, and others.

Jill Magi is the author of Threads and Torchwood. She runs Sona Books.


The workshop fee is $350, which includes a one year Sustaining Poetry
Project membership and tuition for any and all spring and fall classes.

2. As many of you in the Bay Area have no doubt heard, our sister institution 21Grand, home to the important New Yipes reading series as well as wonderful music, art, film & performance programming, has recently been dealing with some "code compliance issues" as defined (& "enforced") by the City of Oakland. As a result, 21Grand has had to jump through numerous bureaucratic hoops in order to retain its licenses for the kinds of programming that tends to challenge the kinds of code categories that city authorities wish to impose. Sadly, although 21G is on the way to getting things squared away with the city, SPT has had to postpone our scheduled Feb.3 Poets Theater Cabaret until this summer. Keep an eye on our blog and/or website for updated information...

Subject:      Alfred Corn on Ekphrasis
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

Notes on Ekphrasis
by Alfred Corn


Ekphrasis (also spelled "ecphrasis") is a direct transcription from the Greek ek, "out of," and phrasis, "speech" or "expression." It's often been translated simply as "description," and seems originally to have been used as a rhetorical term designating a passage in prose or poetry that describes something. More narrowly, it could designate a passage providing a short speech attributed to a mute work of visual art. In recent decades, the use of the term has been limited, first, to visual description and then even more specifically to the description of a real or imagined work of visual art.
The use of visual description in poetry is a huge subject, and a good treatment of the topic is found in Carol T. Christ's study The Finer Optic. Descriptions, in poems, of works of music, cinema, or choreography might also qualify as instances of ekphrasis. But these notes will be concerned only with descriptions of works of visual art in a poem, not with description in general, or with description of other kinds of art.
Horace, in his Epistles, writes a verse letter to his friend Pisos, the opening lines of which develop the metaphor of painting as a means of criticizing arbitrary combinations of incompatible components in a poem. (This is the third letter of Book II of the Epistles.) Beginning at line 361, in a passage that includes the phrase ut pictura poesis ("like a picture, poetry," or "poetry is like a painting") Horace makes a comparison between the two arts. These lines are often cited as the foundational text establishing a connection between visual and verbal art. But note that Horace describes no particular painting; he refers abstractly to various aspects of the art of painting purely as a metaphor to get at the good or bad qualities a poem may exhibit.
The earliest and best known example of ekphrasis is the long description of the shield made by Hephaistos and given to Achilles by his mother Thetis. (The passage is found in Book 18 of the Iliad.) Low-relief sculpture embossed in metal on the surface of the shield is described in elaborate detail. Hephaistos's subjects include constellations, pastures, dancing, and great cities. In fact, visual notation is so extensive that critics have commented that no actual shield in the real world would be able to contain the disparate elements mentioned.
So then Homer has imagined a work of art that could not, materially, exist. The immaterial nature of verbal art allows him to do this. The effect on the reader of his description is multi-faceted. On one hand, it tends to move the narrative farther away from ordinary plausibility. On the other, it provides a dreamlike expansion of the subject at hand and allows the poet to make oblique comments on the Iliad's main narrative.
Similar to Homer's description of Achilles's shield, though briefer, is the description in Book I of Virgil's Aeneid, beginning at line 450, of the carvings on the wall of the temple Aeneas visits when he first comes to Carthage. Depicted are scenes from the Trojan War, which alert the exiled hero to the fact that the story of the Trojan War and his part in it are already legendary.
Another notable instance of ekphrasis occurs in Canto X of Dante's Purgatorio, where the pilgrim poet describes low relief sculptures in white marble carved on the side of the mountain of Purgatory, next to its upward track. These carvings depict Biblical and classical examples of the virtue of humility: the Annunciation, David dancing before the Ark of the Covenant, and the Roman Emperor Trajan addressing the mother of a soldier who has been killed.
Purgatorio in Dante consists of an upwardly spiraling climb around a mountain, and it may well be Trajan's column in Rome that provided him with the visual form for it. That monument is covered with low relief sculptures of scenes from the Dacian War, and, scene by scene, like frames in a comic strip, they rise upward in helical fashion from bottom to top. In Canto X, Dante not only describes the encounter between Trajan and the bereaved mother, he gives us their dialogue and then refers to it as esto visibleparlare, "this visible speaking." In other words, something magical has occurred: a work of visual art has somehow managed to convey an exchange of speech.
Another classic instance of ekphrasis occurs in Book III of Spenser's The Faerie Queene, which is concerned with the virtue of chastity. Britomart comes to the house of sorcerer Busyrane, where she sees tapestries depicting Jove's amorous exploits, a contrary example of the virtue being dealt with.
After Milton, when epic-length poems become rarer in English-language poetry, the use of ekphrasis is limited to shorter poems, for example, Marvell's "The Picture of Little T.C. in a Prospect of Flowers"; or Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn," "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles" and "To Haydon with a Sonnet Written on Seeing the Elgin Marbles"; Shelley's "On the Medusa of Leonardo Da Vinci in the Florentine Gallery"; and Browning's "My Last Duchess." But some long poems as well include them, for example, Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.
In the two English-language cases where a poet was also a painter, ekphrastic poems were actually conceived as accompaniments to an actual painting (or vice versa). Blake's "The Tyger," "The Clod and the Pebble," and "Holy Thursday," for example, were first printed underneath or alongside Blake's graphic rendering of the poem's subject. What have been called Blake's "composite works" also influenced Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who provided verse equivalents to several of his paintings, the texts often inscribed below the picture or within it. Usually, but not always, the execution of the painting came first, as in "The Girlhood of Mary Virgin." With "The Blessed Damozel," the poem preceded the painting.
In the twentieth century many poets produced ekphrastic poems, and the vast majority of these concern actual, not imaginary works of art. Consider, for example, Rilke's "Archaic Torso of Apollo" ; Marianne Moore's "No Swan so Fine" and "Nine Peaches"; Wallace Stevens's "Angel Between Two Paysans"; William Carlos Williams's Pictures from Breughel ; John Berryman's "Hunters in the Snow"; Randall Jarrell's "Knight, Death and the Devil"; W. H. Auden's "The Shield of Achilles," and Elizabeth Bishop's "Large Bad Picture" and "Poem." In recent times there have been a large number of examples, in fact, several anthologies of ekphrastic poems have been assembled, sometimes commissioned by museums whose collections are featured.
Some ekphrastic poems describe photographs, and these may be art photographs or else ordinary snapshots, the latter often depicting members of the poet's family. A disadvantage of using family snapshots is that the original image may not embody sufficient artistry to provide the stuff of interesting commentary; nor is that image available to the reader for comparison with the text. Enormous skill is needed in order to convey visual information of this kind, along with the passions and emotional nuances that pictures from childhood arouse in the author. So there is a risk that only a small part of the authors' feelings will actually be accessible to the reader through the intermediary of words alone. Still, some poets have had success writing this kind of poem, for example, Adrienne Rich in "Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law" and Greg Williamson's "Double Exposures."
Actually, a poem about an obscure painting is also at a disadvantage. Where the original image is well known, we can compare it to the poet's version of what it contains; and the poet's departures from the original, or inaccurate interpretations of it, are sometimes revealing. Without the original image, though, we are forced to trust the poet's description as being accurate, and we are unable to know where it is not. Meanwhile, the compositional task is much more difficult in such cases since the text of the poem has to convey all the relevant visual information, while still qualifying as poetry. On the other hand, if the subject is, say, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, or any other very famous work of art, there's no need to give a detailed description; the audience already knows what's in the painting.
A disadvantage, though, of using very great works of visual art as a subject for ekphrasis is that the comparison between the original and the poem about it may prove too unfavorable. Readers may wonder why they should bother reading a moderately effective poem when they could instead look at the great painting it was based on. If the poem doesn't contain something more than was already available to the audience, it will strike the reader as superfluous, the secondary product of someone too dependent on the earlier, greater work.
The reader may also wonder why the description wasn't done in prose rather than in lines of poetry. All art historians and critics agree that complete and accurate verbal descriptions of visual art are very hard to achieve, even in prose. When the expectations associated with good poetry are part of the goal as well, we see that writing a good ekphrastic poem is a formidable task indeed. The aim of drafting a text entirely adequate to its source, giving a verbal equivalent to every detail in the subject work, is probably too lofty. A more realistic goal is to give a partial account of the work.
Once the ambition of producing a complete and accurate description is put aside, a poem can provide new aspects for a work of visual art. It can provide a special angle of approach not usually brought to bear on the original. For example, in a banqueting scene, the poem might, instead of describing the revelers, focus on the dogs, cats, and pet birds given free rein in the scene.
More generally, a poem can add the overall resources of verbality, with descriptions developed through surprising metaphors, apt commentary cast in lines with unusual diction and crisp rhythm—perhaps even calling on the techniques of traditional prosody. And then, the poet may devise conversations between figures in the painting or group sculpture and give these the quality of poetry. Finally, the poem may actually treat more than one painting at a time, in a kind of verbal collage or double-exposure.
Perhaps the most effective contemporary poems dealing with visual art are those where the authors include themselves in the poem, recounting the background circumstances that led to a viewing of the painting or sculpture in question; or what memories or associations or emotions it stirs in them; or how they might wish the work to be different from what it is. The center of attention in this kind of poem isn't solely the pre-existing work but instead is dual, sharing the autobiographical focus found in the majority of contemporary lyric poems written in English.
Poems like these unite ekphrasis with the autobiographical tradition, which is equally ancient and probably more important than ekphrasis alone. After all, the autobiographical tradition can cite figures such as Ovid, Dante, Ben Jonson, Donne, George Herbert, Pope, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Whitman, Dickinson, Eliot, Akhmatova, Williams, Crane, Lowell, Roethke, Bishop, Berryman, Larkin, Walcott, Merrill, Adrienne Rich, and Seamus Heaney. Of course you can argue that an ekphrastic poem providing no information at all about the author may still convey autobiographical content indirectly, in the form of "voice," tone, level of diction, and the kind and frequency of judgments made in the course of presentation. In "Archaic Torso of Apollo," Rilke gives us no precise autobiographical facts about himself; nevertheless, we get a strong sense of the author's character and prospects from his presentation of the subject, in particular, when he imagines the torso saying to hi
m, "Yo
u must change your life."
Meanwhile, more directly autobiographical ekphrastic poems, like Lowell's "For the Union Dead," Bishop's "Poem," John Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror," Charles Wright's "Homage to Claude Lorraine," or the present author's "Seeing All the Vermeers," locate the act of viewing visual art in a particular place and time, giving it a personal and perhaps even an historical context. The result is then not merely a verbal "photocopy" of the original painting, sculpture, or photograph, but instead a grounded instance of seeing, shaped by forces outside the artwork. In such poems, description of the original work remains partial, but authors add to it aspects drawn from their own experience—the facts, reflections, and feelings that arise at the confluence of a work of visual art and the life of the poet.

Hi Murat,

I like your observation about power and control concerning code.

Concerning code poetry, perhaps both are involved.

In its engagement with the digital literary and other relatively new and/or
unusual forms of the literary, like other avant garde art, in part it may
sometimes seek escape from the usual literary authorities and modes of
production and distribution.

But it's also an attempt to gain understanding of and control of or within
the contemporary language scapes where code and language are conflated,
transmitted, received, interpreted, and misunderstood billions of times per
second.

Also, engagement with code *and* language seems like a particularly apt way
into both engagement with questions of who and what we are.

Dear Friends
Below is a call for papers for an exciting conference taking place at=20
Sussex University in May.

With best wishes,
Gareth Farmer

                      CALL FOR PAPERS

The University of Sussex=92s School of Humanities, in conjunction with the=20
Centre for Modernist Studies, invites submissions for papers to be given at =

the following conference, scheduled for Friday the 16th and Saturday the=20
17th of May 2008:

                    Long Poems ::: Major Forms

The =91long poem=92 has been traditionally conceived of as the principal =
means=20
by which poets confront political and aesthetic problems through sustained=20
investigations. Beyond this general outline, or indeed perhaps because of=20
it, there is little consensus as to either what the long poem
is, or what it might be uniquely capable of. In =91The Poetic Principle,=92 =

Edgar Allen Poe went so far as to assert that =93a long poem does not =
exist=94=20
since =93the ultimate, aggregate, or absolute effect of even the best epic=20
under the sun, is a nullity.=94 Years later, and seeking to resolve the
technical and affective dilemmas that Poe identified, Charles Olson=20
prescribed a =91projective verse=92 that he purported might carry =93much =
larger=20
material than it has carried in our language since the Elizabethans.=94 He=20
thought Pound=92s Cantos exemplified the beginnings of such poetry,
displaying a methodology capable of solving =93problems of larger content =
and=20
of larger forms.=94

This conference seeks to address the contemporary relevance of the long=20
poem: how has it evolved, what standing does it currently hold, and who are =

now its readers? As both a poetic and a critical concept, the =91long =
poem=92=20
presents poets with the difficulty of articulating what Pound called =93a=20
compound of freedom and order=94 that =93hangs between chaos on the one =
side
and mechanics on the other.=94 We hope this conference will provide a forum =

for the consideration of ways in which comprehensive, often formally=20
complex and expansive poems may respond, or fail to respond, to certain=20
=93obligations toward the difficult whole,=94 and to explore what these=20
obligations might now entail for both poets and their readers. We therefore =

welcome proposals for presentations addressing aesthetic, formal, generic,=20
compositional and literary-historical questions the =91long poem=92 brings =
into=20
particular focus.

*

Papers should be no more than 20 minutes in length, and calibrated towards=20
generating wider discussion. Please send a 250-word abstract, along with a=20
brief biographical note by 1st March 2008 to=20
thelongpoemconference@sussex.ac.uk. We will send out notifications shortly=20
thereafter.

Dear Tom,

I don't know off-hand what ambient water temperature is required as a mediu=
m
for the optimal recombination of amino acid cells, but it should be borne i=
n
mind that our concept of warm in terms of water temperature may well have
been cool in the context of the Pre-Cambrian seas, indeed it is an
established fact that the cooler regions of our present-day oceans that are
richest in microbial nutrients and therefore support the greatest diversity
and profusion of marine life. Bearing in mind the conscious (and, of course
sub-conscious) basis for the propagation of 'word strings' I feel that it i=
s
a rather dubious comparison you have made here, and I am glad that you
qualified your comparison with the all important phrase, 'we are told'. I
understand your need to elaborate upon  your protean reference but just as
Selby is so adroit at knowing where to draw a particular work to a
conclusion I think it might have been wiser should you have stopped short a=
t
protean. I hope that the contemporary debate on the ekphrastic will run and
run, it already has several decades behind it so there's no reason why not.
Maybe an ekphrastic exegesis of Alexis Rockman's early paintings of
prehistoric tropical seas would offer an appropriate addendum here. Alexis
Rockman devotees please textually step forward here.

Roy Exley.

If I remember correctly, the original publication of Ashbery's Self-Portrait In A Convex Mirror included a reproduction of the painting upon which it was based, at least in the book form of the poem.  I'm not sure whether it was the whole painting or just part of it.  Anyway, the poem has been reprinted in anthologies without the painting and without losing much, if anything, thereby.  Thank you, however, for your careful, scholarly consideration of the word "ekphrasis".  Regards, Tom Savage

blacksox@ATT.NET wrote:  Notes on Ekphrasis
by Alfred Corn


Ekphrasis (also spelled "ecphrasis") is a direct transcription from the Greek ek, "out of," and phrasis, "speech" or "expression." It's often been translated simply as "description," and seems originally to have been used as a rhetorical term designating a passage in prose or poetry that describes something. More narrowly, it could designate a passage providing a short speech attributed to a mute work of visual art. In recent decades, the use of the term has been limited, first, to visual description and then even more specifically to the description of a real or imagined work of visual art.
The use of visual description in poetry is a huge subject, and a good treatment of the topic is found in Carol T. Christ's study The Finer Optic. Descriptions, in poems, of works of music, cinema, or choreography might also qualify as instances of ekphrasis. But these notes will be concerned only with descriptions of works of visual art in a poem, not with description in general, or with description of other kinds of art.
Horace, in his Epistles, writes a verse letter to his friend Pisos, the opening lines of which develop the metaphor of painting as a means of criticizing arbitrary combinations of incompatible components in a poem. (This is the third letter of Book II of the Epistles.) Beginning at line 361, in a passage that includes the phrase ut pictura poesis ("like a picture, poetry," or "poetry is like a painting") Horace makes a comparison between the two arts. These lines are often cited as the foundational text establishing a connection between visual and verbal art. But note that Horace describes no particular painting; he refers abstractly to various aspects of the art of painting purely as a metaphor to get at the good or bad qualities a poem may exhibit.
The earliest and best known example of ekphrasis is the long description of the shield made by Hephaistos and given to Achilles by his mother Thetis. (The passage is found in Book 18 of the Iliad.) Low-relief sculpture embossed in metal on the surface of the shield is described in elaborate detail. Hephaistos's subjects include constellations, pastures, dancing, and great cities. In fact, visual notation is so extensive that critics have commented that no actual shield in the real world would be able to contain the disparate elements mentioned.
So then Homer has imagined a work of art that could not, materially, exist. The immaterial nature of verbal art allows him to do this. The effect on the reader of his description is multi-faceted. On one hand, it tends to move the narrative farther away from ordinary plausibility. On the other, it provides a dreamlike expansion of the subject at hand and allows the poet to make oblique comments on the Iliad's main narrative.
Similar to Homer's description of Achilles's shield, though briefer, is the description in Book I of Virgil's Aeneid, beginning at line 450, of the carvings on the wall of the temple Aeneas visits when he first comes to Carthage. Depicted are scenes from the Trojan War, which alert the exiled hero to the fact that the story of the Trojan War and his part in it are already legendary.
Another notable instance of ekphrasis occurs in Canto X of Dante's Purgatorio, where the pilgrim poet describes low relief sculptures in white marble carved on the side of the mountain of Purgatory, next to its upward track. These carvings depict Biblical and classical examples of the virtue of humility: the Annunciation, David dancing before the Ark of the Covenant, and the Roman Emperor Trajan addressing the mother of a soldier who has been killed.
Purgatorio in Dante consists of an upwardly spiraling climb around a mountain, and it may well be Trajan's column in Rome that provided him with the visual form for it. That monument is covered with low relief sculptures of scenes from the Dacian War, and, scene by scene, like frames in a comic strip, they rise upward in helical fashion from bottom to top. In Canto X, Dante not only describes the encounter between Trajan and the bereaved mother, he gives us their dialogue and then refers to it as esto visibleparlare, "this visible speaking." In other words, something magical has occurred: a work of visual art has somehow managed to convey an exchange of speech.
Another classic instance of ekphrasis occurs in Book III of Spenser's The Faerie Queene, which is concerned with the virtue of chastity. Britomart comes to the house of sorcerer Busyrane, where she sees tapestries depicting Jove's amorous exploits, a contrary example of the virtue being dealt with.
After Milton, when epic-length poems become rarer in English-language poetry, the use of ekphrasis is limited to shorter poems, for example, Marvell's "The Picture of Little T.C. in a Prospect of Flowers"; or Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn," "On Seeing the Elgin Marbles" and "To Haydon with a Sonnet Written on Seeing the Elgin Marbles"; Shelley's "On the Medusa of Leonardo Da Vinci in the Florentine Gallery"; and Browning's "My Last Duchess." But some long poems as well include them, for example, Byron's Childe Harold's Pilgrimage.
In the two English-language cases where a poet was also a painter, ekphrastic poems were actually conceived as accompaniments to an actual painting (or vice versa). Blake's "The Tyger," "The Clod and the Pebble," and "Holy Thursday," for example, were first printed underneath or alongside Blake's graphic rendering of the poem's subject. What have been called Blake's "composite works" also influenced Dante Gabriel Rossetti, who provided verse equivalents to several of his paintings, the texts often inscribed below the picture or within it. Usually, but not always, the execution of the painting came first, as in "The Girlhood of Mary Virgin." With "The Blessed Damozel," the poem preceded the painting.
In the twentieth century many poets produced ekphrastic poems, and the vast majority of these concern actual, not imaginary works of art. Consider, for example, Rilke's "Archaic Torso of Apollo" ; Marianne Moore's "No Swan so Fine" and "Nine Peaches"; Wallace Stevens's "Angel Between Two Paysans"; William Carlos Williams's Pictures from Breughel ; John Berryman's "Hunters in the Snow"; Randall Jarrell's "Knight, Death and the Devil"; W. H. Auden's "The Shield of Achilles," and Elizabeth Bishop's "Large Bad Picture" and "Poem." In recent times there have been a large number of examples, in fact, several anthologies of ekphrastic poems have been assembled, sometimes commissioned by museums whose collections are featured.
Some ekphrastic poems describe photographs, and these may be art photographs or else ordinary snapshots, the latter often depicting members of the poet's family. A disadvantage of using family snapshots is that the original image may not embody sufficient artistry to provide the stuff of interesting commentary; nor is that image available to the reader for comparison with the text. Enormous skill is needed in order to convey visual information of this kind, along with the passions and emotional nuances that pictures from childhood arouse in the author. So there is a risk that only a small part of the authors' feelings will actually be accessible to the reader through the intermediary of words alone. Still, some poets have had success writing this kind of poem, for example, Adrienne Rich in "Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law" and Greg Williamson's "Double Exposures."
Actually, a poem about an obscure painting is also at a disadvantage. Where the original image is well known, we can compare it to the poet's version of what it contains; and the poet's departures from the original, or inaccurate interpretations of it, are sometimes revealing. Without the original image, though, we are forced to trust the poet's description as being accurate, and we are unable to know where it is not. Meanwhile, the compositional task is much more difficult in such cases since the text of the poem has to convey all the relevant visual information, while still qualifying as poetry. On the other hand, if the subject is, say, Leonardo's Mona Lisa, or any other very famous work of art, there's no need to give a detailed description; the audience already knows what's in the painting.
A disadvantage, though, of using very great works of visual art as a subject for ekphrasis is that the comparison between the original and the poem about it may prove too unfavorable. Readers may wonder why they should bother reading a moderately effective poem when they could instead look at the great painting it was based on. If the poem doesn't contain something more than was already available to the audience, it will strike the reader as superfluous, the secondary product of someone too dependent on the earlier, greater work.
The reader may also wonder why the description wasn't done in prose rather than in lines of poetry. All art historians and critics agree that complete and accurate verbal descriptions of visual art are very hard to achieve, even in prose. When the expectations associated with good poetry are part of the goal as well, we see that writing a good ekphrastic poem is a formidable task indeed. The aim of drafting a text entirely adequate to its source, giving a verbal equivalent to every detail in the subject work, is probably too lofty. A more realistic goal is to give a partial account of the work.
Once the ambition of producing a complete and accurate description is put aside, a poem can provide new aspects for a work of visual art. It can provide a special angle of approach not usually brought to bear on the original. For example, in a banqueting scene, the poem might, instead of describing the revelers, focus on the dogs, cats, and pet birds given free rein in the scene.
More generally, a poem can add the overall resources of verbality, with descriptions developed through surprising metaphors, apt commentary cast in lines with unusual diction and crisp rhythm—perhaps even calling on the techniques of traditional prosody. And then, the poet may devise conversations between figures in the painting or group sculpture and give these the quality of poetry. Finally, the poem may actually treat more than one painting at a time, in a kind of verbal collage or double-exposure.
Perhaps the most effective contemporary poems dealing with visual art are those where the authors include themselves in the poem, recounting the background circumstances that led to a viewing of the painting or sculpture in question; or what memories or associations or emotions it stirs in them; or how they might wish the work to be different from what it is. The center of attention in this kind of poem isn't solely the pre-existing work but instead is dual, sharing the autobiographical focus found in the majority of contemporary lyric poems written in English.
Poems like these unite ekphrasis with the autobiographical tradition, which is equally ancient and probably more important than ekphrasis alone. After all, the autobiographical tradition can cite figures such as Ovid, Dante, Ben Jonson, Donne, George Herbert, Pope, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Keats, Whitman, Dickinson, Eliot, Akhmatova, Williams, Crane, Lowell, Roethke, Bishop, Berryman, Larkin, Walcott, Merrill, Adrienne Rich, and Seamus Heaney. Of course you can argue that an ekphrastic poem providing no information at all about the author may still convey autobiographical content indirectly, in the form of "voice," tone, level of diction, and the kind and frequency of judgments made in the course of presentation. In "Archaic Torso of Apollo," Rilke gives us no precise autobiographical facts about himself; nevertheless, we get a strong sense of the author's character and prospects from his presentation of the subject, in particular, when he imagines the torso saying to
 hi
m, "Yo
u must change your life."
Meanwhile, more directly autobiographical ekphrastic poems, like Lowell's "For the Union Dead," Bishop's "Poem," John Ashbery's "Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror," Charles Wright's "Homage to Claude Lorraine," or the present author's "Seeing All the Vermeers," locate the act of viewing visual art in a particular place and time, giving it a personal and perhaps even an historical context. The result is then not merely a verbal "photocopy" of the original painting, sculpture, or photograph, but instead a grounded instance of seeing, shaped by forces outside the artwork. In such poems, description of the original work remains partial, but authors add to it aspects drawn from their own experience—the facts, reflections, and feelings that arise at the confluence of a work of visual art and the life of the poet.

Dear Jim--

actually Murat thanked me twice for making this observation, distinction,
about power and  control you mention,  as just about all my letters are
about this issue of power and control-In the last letter re
electricity,electricity itself is a "splitting" of two aspects of control
and power  within its own history:  on the one hand the "good" D/C current
of Edison is associated with the "safe" uses of Holzer's "Projections" and
the "Death," hooded Electric Chair uses are "plugged into"  A/C.

You note that "an engagement with code 'and' language seems like a
particularly apt way into both an engagement with questions of who and what
we are"

A fundamental of the engagement with code is when the bill for the cable
arrives, as well as the electricity bill, without which there is no cable.
Even when using a public access or job-provided hook-up you have invested in
it somewhere along the line.  The forms of access or the non-access of codes
already begin to define who and what we are.  And, within access, the types
of programs available, the types of machines, the types of and ranges of
codes one is allowed to use--these further determine who and what we are
within this digital code determination of who and what we are.
      A person with access to a lot of highly developed state of the art
equipment and programs and machines may appear in code as a much more
complex and "refined" and "avant-garde" being than a person restricted to an
hour at  an old and slow computer in a public library in a run down central
city neighborhood.  The latter person may do great street art, but is always
running the risk of jail for doing so.  As an artist, they may be afr better
than than the code being--but--"no access."
        Another aspect of code is the ways in which it plays on persons
being impressed by it, believing in it, taking it as "real" and "true."
         For example, at one point in the arguments over the use of the
materials provided by "Curveball," one agent finally screams--"we have
evidence that backs him up!."  Her opponent demands--"yeah, from where?"
"From the web," triumphantly replies the first agent.  "Where do you think
HE got them!" shrieks her opponent.
         Interestingly, Jenny Holzer got her images of Rumsfeld's memos for
the "Projections" show from the web.
         Does this mean she's also just peddling public domain images as
"top secret" "avant-garde" Curveballs for the benefit of an appreciatively
wowed audience?


 One of the things to think about with the digital is that the electricity
is supplied by powerful corporations and the grids are subject to the
approval of political powers.  The "avant-garde" in its military sense is to
be in advance--and in this case, in order to create the new web libraries,
texts, code collections, there has been a great deal of attendant
destruction of actual libraries, archives, archeologies, artifacts.
architectures. (As the Electronic Poetry Center and Ubu Web grow, the Iraq
Libraries, Museums and sites almost completely vanish; the USA and Britain
never signed the 1955 International treaty having to do with respecting the
treatment of these in occupied countries.)  The digital and code are not so
much the avant-garde at all as already the dominant--(the 443, 000 listings
for "code poetry" for example) --already the controlling interests so to
speak of free market globalization and disaster capitalism.  Digitalization
and codes still participate in the 19th century myth of "Progress" which
Rimbaud was bitterly attacking.  It creates new forms of colonization and
destructions of cultures, replacing them with new codes designed by
engineers and code artists from around the world in the employ of
corporations, academic institutions, the military, etc.  Code poetry will
exist and be widely disseminated as long as it remains within acceptable
areas, which seems most likely that it will, since the purveyors are
embracers of code itself, code as "progress" itself, towards the "mystery of
being" and "conquest of the world."

         In Melanie Klein's The Shock Doctrine, the CIA sponsored 1950's
shock therapy treatments are linked with Milton Friedman's Economic Shock
Theories, first realized in the CIA engineered coup in Chile on 9/11 1973.
The idea is that these Shock economics will bring with time Democracy--but
in every case, they have been so unpopular that they have had to be
enforced--not only brute force, but by the electric shocks of torture.  The
"electric current" so to speak runs through the world and now "back" to the
USA, via Katrina and today one of the biggest transfers of wealth in the
history of the USA.  The number of people who can afford electricity or
access to the web shrinks, the number of people controlling the electric
power shrinks, and the amount of military and economic power involved in the
control of the electric grows, becomes more concentrated in a few, and ever
more fewer number of persons.
        At the same time, of course, the idea that the web, the digital, the
electronic, the code is where it is happening is ever more encouraged, as
this becomes the place more restricted to the more easily observed and
obedient trained persons of the society.
        By far one of the boomingest businesses in the world is that of of
security and surveillance, led by the Israelis, who use Gaza literally as a
showroom.  Others are trying hard to catch up.  The construction of Walls in
Iraq, Green Zones, the world's largest US embassy in Baghdad, the Border
Fence with Mexico, gated communities the world over, the enclaves for
corporate headquarters and embassies, for Sheik and Kings, General,s Movie
Stars, Pop Idols, Billionaires--privatized security forces of all kinds--
equipped with the latest in electronically controlled weaponry and
surveillance equipment, this is an immese business growing at an immense
pace, and reuqiring plenty of good code workers.

         Due to wars and the polices of the Shock Doctrine and
globalization, ever more people daily are not on the digital and electric
grids.  A child dies every five minutes in Iraq.  In Milwaukee now over a
third of the children live in poverty and go to school without breakfast.
The loss of homes is sky rocketing, loss of electrictyand heat, the code
access vanishing.  Already in many areas of the world private armies and
walls, electronic grids, are constructed in order to keep out the immense
masses of  what Mike Davis calls the "Planet of Slums." Gaza the world's
largest prison, is but a crude model for the lockups of the coming codes,
complete with "avant-garde" installations of Light Projections doubling as
Surveillance Lights sweeping the slums and alleys and giant code poems by
"poet laureates" dominating the landscapes on huge billboards and code
poetry figue largely at the new academic conventions.  .

   In the annals of the New Extreme Experimental American Poetry it will be
realized that one of the first truly great poems of an electrical merging of
the D'/C current of Whitman's "I sing the body electric" and the "A'/C"
current of the hooded figure in the eletcric chair is that of the hooded
figure in Abu Ghraib, wired and standing on a crate, arms outstretched, as
though crucified, hooded--awaiting the moment of shock which will force him
to speak the new poetry--
those raw sounds to be translated by radical experimental innovative poetry
means into american digital codes
and become the further dehumanization of the masked "enemy combatant"
"non-poet"
for the triumphant glorification and triumph of the "Projections" of "our
codes"--

yes, codes do indeed have the capabality of being an engagement with
questions of who and what we are--
of what we may or may not be allowed to be--be restricted to be--can pay to
be--

David,

"Was that the face that launched a thousand ships
And toppled the topless towers of Ilium?" Christopher Marlowe (poet and
government agent/spy, and the only true rival of William Shakespeare, maybe
Shakespeare himself)

In the poem "The Nigger in the Photograph" Ece Ayhan refers to *The Jew of
Malta*. In the same book where "The Nigger" appears, *A Blind Cat Black *(Sun
and Moon), there is a poem "The Secret Jew."

Ships and trains (the latter the subject of a parallel thread going on
between Alan Sondheim and me in which Alan's photographs of a train museum
in Morganstown has the qualities of cuts-ups): in Eric Ambler's spy noir *The
Coffin for Dr. Demetrius, *a meeting between two agents occurs in the train
going to Istanbul. Istanbul, "neutral" during Second World War, was the very
den of spies, longing and lost causes, another * Casablanca*. In the movie
version of *The Coffin*, Orson Wells (the parallel to Claude Rains) plays
the benevolent/threatening Turkish police chief inspector Hakim Bey. Hakim
Bey is the pseudonym/heteronym to Peter Lamborn Wilson whose anarchist
manifestos fight the codes of mediated language and whose ground breaking
essays on Sufism gave me first the hint of the possibilities of using Sufism
as a reservoir of language (of counter-codes) for political thought and
poetry. In my essay "Eleven Septembers Later," written around Benjamin
Hollander's poem *Vigilance* (Beyond Baroque) and Orson Wells's *A Touch of
Evil*, I propose the concept of a new poetic form, "Film Lumiere," a
prophetic genre in which every story is told twice (e,g. Agamemnon's ship
and the British ship), superimposed on each other, creating a collision in a
confrontation with the other. Of course, the collision and collapse of the
twin towers (the ur-event occurring twice, maybe an ironic, contra binary
code) is the generative event where time/space travel occurs
instantaneously,in one single act. Was that the event/act/political gesture
that launched a thousand bombs and the utter insanity of the American
psyche? (Wasn't *The Iliad* also a confrontation between two cultures, East
and West?)

For Marcus (another parallel, correspondent thread occurring in this list),
the physical event is the only thing which is "real"; everything else is
terrorism (post-modern). For me the physical event and its psychic,
political, mythical, historical resonances exist in a fluid continuum;
thoughts, which Marcus dismisses as arbitrary, etc., have "real," actual
consequences. They act as causes, as in another context I think David you
said, "words have real consequences." Ilium is not only a mental state but
also a place (though in ruins, fragments, recently added to by a gigantic
wooden horse for tourist attraction, mention the mongrel accumulation of
codes). Marcus's is a binary (Western, technological) code of control,
everything not fitting it being non-existent or illegitimate (or romantic,
terroristic or merely frustrated or having a period). Mine is a contra code
of a-symmetrical dialectic.

The essay, "Eleven Septembers Later," ends with a discussion of *The
Talmud*as an early example of "film lumiere" embodied in words (there
are examples
of it in other media, particularly in films which strive towards the state
of photography). Basically, film lumniere is the superimposition (as
conflict or expansion) of different dynamic media, film, T.V., computer or
language itself, on the contemplative, stasis essence of photographic image.
In *The Talmud*, a basic enigmatic text (code) is surrounded by codes
(commentaries) elaborating on, expanding or subverting (musically riffing
from) this basic text. Text and commentary together, they create a matrix of
prophetic Jewish life, film lumniere, in your words, "an illumination":

"Actually one could say that "code is the subject" of itself in such
works as Illuminated Manuscripts and examples such as the Alhambra.  The
calligraphies and images which are *within* [italics my own] the lettering
and borders of
illuminated Manuscripts contain further meanings which are forms of codes
both "a part of" and "apart from" in a supplementary sense.  In the
Alhambra, the caligraphies are both written texts and mathematical formulae,
there is a doubling carrying of codes."

The essay, "The Peripheral Space of Photography" is another example of "film
lumiere" where the conglomeration of responses to photographic images not
only "illuminate" those images, but are themselves "illuminations": "light"
(mysticism?) as the tongue of a subversive code.

David, I am honored that you see me as an ally in a cause of artistic,
philosophic and maybe political liberation. Indeed we are:

"        Love of Words

A part of,
apart from my lover.

As words separate, I draw close
as words draw near, I fall apart."    *(The Structure of Escape)*


"Granada is an ugly city containing the Alhambra,
the Alhambra Hotel with its stupendous baked alaska.... " *(The Structure of
Escape)
*

"A trillion plus one is smaller than a trillion plus two

a nod towards the sky light window in the roof
the illusionary preparatory crack of escape

the real escape occurs twice, being born and dying

dying the other shoe of freedom
drops...."       *(The Structure of Escape)


*David, puns are I think a crucial, telegraphic code of time/space travel
-pigeon communications. One among many examples: why, for example, the
eerie, mysterious, reversed correspondence between "a part" and "apart"? Is
it a mere coincidence or does a hidden-in-plain-sight correspondence between
the two exist? Marcus will say it's all coincidence, fancy/arbitrary
dancing. But doesn't "apart" as a single word contain the longing for
reunion separation (spiritual separation) involve (a version of space
travel)? This way language is not something "there" but becomes something
shaped, altered by our being. It has essence essence, part of that being; it
has light.

"Coincidence" (and its underbelly "paranoia/code) is the underlying theme of
many of the interesting threads in The Poetics and in the Imitapoetics Lists
during the last few months. Is coincidence merely itself (something
code-ally there, and pure, devoid of human thought), which I think is the
impulse behind both the process generated art and Marcus's positivist
"skepticism" and his seeming attack on post Modernism in the name of a
"human" art?

Or does coincidence have a "plot"? Of course, seeing plots, codes is the
true, ambiguous essence of paranoia. Even paranoids have enemies and stopped
clocks twice a day tell the time, in a more precise, supreme way because
they do not move, like an Einsteinian time keeper of absolute time. Was
Cassandra a paranoic or a reader of the codes of disaster (here to Agamemnon
again)? That's why film lumiere -an art of seeing and detecting codes- must
finally be -necessity being the mother fucking mother of invention-
prophetic.

I think this thread started -or hooked up with- the seemingly unrelated
thread of inaugural poems. I wonder if, paranoically/prophetically, we are
searching for ("[creating] a code which one finds as one goes along") a new
poetic/artistic code for the coming new presidency.

Ciao,

Murat

Hi Jim,

I understand what you are seeing. But In *most* code poetry I have come
across (I must admit I know a small part of it) I see very little skepticism
towards the digital media. Most of the time,it seems to me, the act involves
an enthusiastic and non-critical embrace of a technological opening to
create new "art." This sounds delusional, and honestly very depressing to
me. Alan Sondheim's is, despite his own possible protestations, the only
work I see imbued with this spirit of skepticism, though in his work this
skepticism involves paradoxically a radical and obsessive absorption in the
medium itself. His images and atavar films -as well as some of his word
poems- seem to derive from a bottomless space of the mind.

Are there other works of that caliber? For instance, Peter's
letter-landscapes (is that a fair term?) are very impressive when one sees
them first. But, to me at least, after a certain point, they become
repetitious, the churning out of a discovered -though in the memory of that
first seeing impressive- method? Am I missing something? Doesn't the lack of
friction in the method (I am assuming it is a method, though I may be wrong)
creates "too many" of the same thing? Mustn't art, to some extent, always
involve a reinvention of the wheel? The original impulse, which started the
process (a process at the threshold of method) must also contain the seeds
of its ending. That ending frees the code of that process from entering (or
becoming) a system, letting it escape.

Ciao,

Murat

I wish I had a romantic cape.

I'm actually deeply interested in post-modern defences of reason (Gillian
Rose, Lyn Hejinian). They are about discriminating between Reason and
Authority. I would think in contemporary America that would be a most
profitable line of thought.

Just wanted to let Buffpo fellows know that I've just this week posted some previously unpublished photos of Ed Dorn reading in Buffalo in 1974; here's the link: http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=27143&l=35b06&id=552184387

I also featured the reading at which I took the photos last Sunday on Wordplay, the show about poets and poetry that Sebastian Matthews and I produce at Asheville's WPVM. The show's available for streaming or download through this Sunday from the Archive page at wpvm.org; eventually we'll find a permanent home for it. It was a treat to listen to Dorn reading Recollections of Gran Apacheria again as I was putting the show together; it's still riveting.

You'll find frequent mentions of Ed at my blog (http://www.naturespoetry.blogspot.com/), including the production notes for the Wordplay show, which gives a few new details about the 1974 reading and the recording.

Enjoy,

Jeff

Subject:      outline of emanent research (current work at wvu)
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII; format=flowed

outline of emanent research


(note while the notions of 'code,' 'coding,' 'decoding,' codework,
underlie almost everything below, they're not explicit - nor are the
actions of reading and writing. the actions can be considered emergent
phenomena, and the notions as primitives in the sense of members of a set,
etc. again, the analog and digital phenomenologies are implicit as well,
as are the (related) concepts of abjection and purification. the analyses
of these comes out through praxis, attention to detail, thinking through
mandalic structuring until the scaffolding leads, not to silence, but to
tending. this should be clearer as the work progresses.

i should note that the following is both a constitution of my usual/cur-
rent directions and most likely too ambitious. the trajectories circulate
around formal systems and their psychoanalytic/psychological receptivi-
ties, around emanents and 'true worlds,' around edge phenomena which turn
towards the uncanny and abject, around languages, bodies, sexualities,
communalities, and inhabitations. i have increasingly worked through
buddhist philosophies, the analogic and digital at the limits, notions of
'dis/eased' philosophies, deathing and uneasy worlds. now that i have a
clear time to think through these things, the outline below is useful as a
guide; for that matter, it's a guide to the past few years of the 'inter-
net text' as well.)

I. motion capture: this conjures up external behavioral characteristics
translated into internal processes (penetration, scale, displacement,
torsion, according to various geometries). think of mocap behaviors
operating within a constrained field with strange attractors / catas-
trophic jumps. continue to develop mocap with new multi-valent sensors
and software rewrites:

1. turning nodes on and off
2. combining nodes
3. mathesis such that node1 = f(node{n not = 1}), or such that
    node1 = recursively f(node1)
4. multivalent sensors such that sensor(x) = sensor[{n}]

what are the emergent images here?

what is the possibility of constructing bvh files with additional nodes
determined mathematically from the hardware set? or mathematically from
extraneous data?

what is the possibility of other organic models (i.e. than human or
animal forms)?

IA. data remappings

entry of bvh files into blender:
1. modeled onto abstracted forms
2. modeled onto parent/child forms
3. modeled onto metaball forms

blender file outputs:

1. entry into cave environment: static or dynamic
2. video output
3. what is the possibility of gaming output here? (moving around emanent
    environment)
3. second life output: static or dynamic/interactive

IB. interiors

1. standardized interiors: sheave-skin, sheave-organism
2. constructed 'model' interiors: solid, transparent, penetrable,
    impenetrable
3. abject fluxed interiors: how should these be constructed?

IC. interior narratologies

1. abject/purified narratologies and emanent interactions
2. abjected/purified contents of dis/ease, dis/order, ecstasy, ekstasis,
    catatonia, defuge, death/immobility, sexuality, speech/murmured/
    whispered/cried/screamed, body formed/deformed
3. tantric/middleway theoretics

ID. choreographic mocap (see above)

1. additional issues of jump/leap, exhaustion, tether
2. video/photographic output as well as bvh

II. scan

phenomenology of scanning, causality across scanned lines

IIA. small scanner

1. head/speech phenomena dissected
2. schizophrenias and beam-splitters
3. reflections from coils, air condensers
4. static tantric buddha image: sutured, stitched-displaced, node
    combinations and splits
5. wounds, scars, lips, genitals, ears

output into .obj files into blender/cave
output into video/still image files

within blender: solve the issue of disappearance/transparency

IIIB. large scanner

1. interior scans: rooms with bodies, reflections, dance-studio,
    scan-choreographies
2. exterior scans at bretz coke ovens, persona rapid transit (in motion),
    soccer fields
3. mobilized body scans in inert environments: reading 2d -> 3d, nature of
    the inference.
3. environmental scans with mobilized and peripheral bodies
5. narratologies of such bodies: violence, chase, jump/fall, etc.
6. choreographic narratologies

III. access grid (open source internet 2 group messaging/environment)

1. distant interaction with emanents
2. readings of the corporate / corporate bodies: photographs/video
3. theory and discussion, levinas, leder, lingis, etc. at the distance
    of telecommunications

IV. cave and second life

1. performance and documentation
2. working/running within emanent interiors
3. and so forth

V. goals of the above:

1. what does it mean to be in-carnated within the real/virtual/
    true world?
2. what are the edge-phenomena/plastic and static limits of the body?
3. of the geopolitical body? of the political-economic body?
    performance: abu-gharayb modeling in sl
    performance: abu-gharayb modeling in choreography
4. what are the signifiers of bodily arousal/violence/meditation?
    how are these constituted within the real/virtual?
5. readings: what does it mean to read the real body? the virtual body?
6. what are the ontologies and epistemologies involved here?
    ontological status of the so-called virtual -
    schrodinger's cat paradox and collapse of the wave function as model
    for simultaneous analogic/digital readings -
    seeing through microscopy (tunnel, scanning, optical, etc.):
    are ontology and epistemology equivalent at the limit?
    (are analogic and digital equivalent at a parallel limit?)

VI. medical model

1. internals and externals, static/dynamic. remnants of the visible
    human project, gendering of the visual/internal
2. comfort, dis/comfort, ease, dis/ease, hysteria and abjection/fluid-
    ity (laycock's 1840 essay on hysteria, kristeva, chasseguet-smirgel)
3. dis/ease, hysteria, and so forth of emanents
    distorted emanent behavior and body image (gaz)
    distorted surface textures and behavior-collisions (sondheim)
    distorted worlding, 'bringing one out of the true world' (etc.)
4. medical model and technology
5. psychoanalytics and technology, psychoanalytics of emanents

VII. radio

1. vlf - very low frequency - body interferences with antenna
    reception, phenomenology of body coupling with antenna
2. scanner - social, continuous socio-political landscape description.
3. sw - anomalous signals
4. long-wave - anomalous signals
5. crystal - the receptivity of inert materials, primordial radio and
    primordial radio culture
6. phenomenology of the antenna/field: materiality of the world as
    electromagnetic channeling

VIII. emanents within fieldings, choreographies, edge/boundary phenomena

VIIIA. praxis of edge/boundary phenomena

1. analogic and worn emanent boundaries
2. edge / boundary phenomena - physics and psychophysics of the game-
    world edge in second life
3. phenomena of the sheave-skin and sheave-skin internals
4. phenomena of medical models in relation to edge/boundaries

VIIIB. praxis of edge/boundary phenomena with hardware/software

1. edge phenomena in literature, codework, mathesis of the text
    (cramer's and reith's programs)
2. edge phenomena within the motion capture software, poser, blender,
    calculations for example of sin(tan x) as tan x nears the
    asymptote
3. generalization of edge phenomena into the dialectic between tacit
    knowledge (polyani) and error (winograd/flores)

VIIIC. live choreographies:

1. foofwa and soccer (edge phenomena, dancesport, etc.)
2. foofwa with crystal radio, vlf radio, etc. in large field
3. sexuality of ballet (nude ballet, classical or genre figures),
    gendering of roles, ballet as emanation
4. anita berber narratologies ('annihilation: to the limit!')
5. foofwa dancework at coke ovens
6. 'body-contouring' of dance/geography
    the geography of dance, dance of geography, dance geography
7. 'body-contouring' of dance/technology: dance at the limits
    of the machine

IX. world-constructions

1. what constitutes worlds? constructing?
    world of the text, inhabitation/dwelling/building (heidegger,
    dufrenne)
2. what constitutes the true world? worlding?
    'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),
    'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which
    virtual, real, and ikonic are blurred and interpenetrating, somewhat
    equivalent, and within which traditional epistemologies of symbol/
    sign/signifier/signified/index/ikon etc. break down (kalachakra
    tantra, jeffrey hopkins)
3. 'reading' underlying (substructural, configuration files, guides)
    organization of mocap/scan through surface phenomena
    (and the relationship of this reading to waddington's epigenetic
    landscapes)
4. who is world? communality, consensuality?
    the problem of other minds and the problem of consensual other minds
    (group hallucinations, vijnanavada, dwarf sitings, ufos, etc.)

X. outputs:

4. series of performances (individual and collaborative)
    morgantown and elsewhere across real geographies
    anywhere across virtual geographies
5. formal presentations at wvu (spring and perhaps fall)

Description:

In Not so Fast Robespierre, Buffalo's Johnny Appleseed of publishing lays
out a public and private map of Buffalo's (and his personal) community. Wit=
h
his selected Western New York School and personal support system in place,
he moves onto "The Book of Life", which, as always, proceeds disaster as
Gatza battles through=8Brightly or wrongly=8Bthe "Cataclysm 535".

Kevin Thurston, Performance Artist & Poet; author of I=B9am


By placing equal stress on the pleasures and duties of friendship and the
threat of natural catastrophe, Not So Fast, Robespierre rescues intimacy
from self-involvement and affection from affectation, reinvigorating the
confessional poem.  Frank O'Hara once created convivial letters out of a
collaged New York City life; today, in his labyrinth of lyric, email
exchanges, notes, memoir, conspiracy and history, Geoffrey Gatza has
achieved the poetry of the search engine and I.M.

Evan Willner, author of homemade traps for new world Brians, nominated for =
a
Pushcart Prize


How can Geoffrey Gatza fit so much love between two cardboard covers?  Not
So Fast Robespierre snakes us through a world of poets, neighbors, teachers
and muses, all with a raw devotion we would do well to wear on our own coat
sleeves.  This series of remembrances does not discriminate in spreading ou=
t
for us equal measures of admiration and lessons learned because, in the end=
,
"Everyone gets a gold star and cake in the friendly garden."

Hi Murat,

If you are interested, here are a couple of pages of links:

Well, Murat, different people have very different ideas about what's
interesting in art, not just in the abstract, but when it comes to
evaluating particular works or artists. Or types of art. Or... or or and
backspace tilda tilda and or or shift esc ctrl alt.

Like it or not, there is a growing body of work out there on the net--and in
performance, and in galleries, etc--where the literary is either central or
at least involved strongly. In hybrid work that involves various arts and
media. And technologies.

As to the attitudes of the artists and the works to the technologies that
they use, of course it varies also. I'm on several lists where digital
artists, whether they're programmers or video-oriented, or more typically
visual-art-oriented (or whatever) post. And generally the attitudes toward
technology are quite varied, no more or less varied than you'd find in any
other fairly heterogeneous group. What with the proliferation of blogs and
video on the net, there's a whole new wave of people being involved in art
and the net who are mainly concerned with, say, video or print, and the net
is simply a distribution environment or a discussion/communications channel
for work that isn't so much oriented towards the net as other media.

And that's fine. The more the merrier. And, in poetry, there's also a kind
of heterogeneous ecology. Print poets, net poets, performance poets, visual
poets, programmer-poets, etc, and all cross-products of these.

It's almost as if it isn't so much whether there is unanimity about a work
or artist or type of work so much as opposing strong feelings on various
topics concerning the work that is the more telling phenomenon about the
work or artist or whatever. 'Code poetry' raises some hackles, puts some
peoples' noses out of joint, and thrills others. It's an attempt to do
something other than use the computer to produce the known types of poetry,
sometimes. I like that spirit of exploration and discovery. It's often an
attempt to take poetry in unusual directions. And to get this machine doing
something other than spreadsheets, email, and 9-5 work. Among other things.

your posts amaze me, David. i always enjoy them very much. you seem to put
so much time and thought into them. and they're so well-written. if i don't
respond quickly or, sometimes, at all, apologies. sometimes you raise very
good issues that demand more time to respond to than i can manage. and
sometimes, even if i had the time, i just don't know how to respond.

i see you have developed further your provocative notion of the New Extreme
Experimental American Poetry. compelling. amusing. serious, though, not
simply satiric. burroughs would nod. yes, burroughs nods.

but i don't think Charles Bernstein deserves the satire he gets in it.
Bernstein seems to me an interesting writer who has also given much back to
writers and poetry, with the intellectual capital his fame has brought him.
rather than simply being in it for his own art, which is often how it goes.

you also extend the notion of 'code poetry' into domains where it belongs.
eloquently.

code poetry t-shirts? i musta missed that. but classes. yes, it's true. many
of them. not only on 'code poetry' but more broadly in 'digital poetry',
'new media poetry', 'hypermedia', 'cyberpoetry', 'cybertext', 'digital
literature', 'digital literacy', 'digital media', 'digital poetics',
'electronic literature', 'hypertext literature', 'intermedia', 'multimedia
literature', 'textual media', and so on...these are the names of some of the
courses i've run across in which digital poetry is taught. and this reflects
not only the work itself being done but also, of course, the current media
landscape.

i think there should be a David Chirot book of Poetics posts. Enjoyed your
elucidation of Burroughs, also, thought it was right on.

my own feeling about people losing an ability to read and write
independently is that it's a mixture of things. as you say, critical
thinking is not something energetically supported by much big money. and
education, in the current mediascape, is difficult.

but this is surely part of the challenge of poetry in the digital. to
provide thoughtful, critical, moving, human, innovative work in media where
the norm is less progressive.

Yes, that's true also.

I met a scholar this summer, Claudia Kozak from Buenos Aires, who has
written a book on grafitti in Buenos Aires. She only included illegal
material. If it wasn't illegal, it didn't get in the book. Though of course
there was undoubtedly a lot that was illegal that also wasn't in the book.
She has turned her attention now to writing about digital writing.

Which made me think about the similarities. For the most part, people who do
code poetry do not appear to be particularly well-off. Like most artists and
poets. They want to be poets, not financiers. They're not on the street,
usually, but they are way not fancy, for the most part. They do what they
need to do to keep it together to do their art and live an artistically
active life exploring the work of others, also--and the rest of the world,
as they may.

What I do is not illegal, for the most part. But it does share some
similarities with the grafitti artists. I do it because it's what I love
doing. No one pays me to do it. I'm broke. My work is not winning any
awards. No jobs. No press. No local interest. No interest from business or
big media. It is for an electronic interzone. I always wanted to be a poet.
And I always liked things like math and music and visual art. Lately
programming. Now I try to combine them all with programming for the net.

The grafitti is here today gone tomorrow. So too will be my stuff, probably.
I don't know. I don't do it to be immortal. I do it for people now for them
to think about people of tomorrow. Poetry of tomorrow. And today, and
previously. I try to make interesting things happen on a computer screen.

I don't spend huge sums on it. The cable. The hosting for my site. The
computer. Usually my software is hot. Though I do buy some of it, like
Director, which isn't cheap. But well worth it.

I am lucky to have had beautiful parents who let me go to university and
study many things. Including computer science. So I don't need much help
with anything to do with computers. I know how to learn on my own what I
don't know. Though I'm slow at it and getting slower. Technical stuff still
comes hard, but I can do it.

Well, if you google
code poetry
you get stuff for code poetry, stuff for code, and stuff for poetry. if you
google
+"code poetry"
then you get 116,000 and although all those supposedly have "code poetry"
somewhere in the page, you get a lot of extraneous matter.

if you google flarf, you get 34,000.

Yes there are lots of default values. Designed by corps and so on, as you
say. I think part of the idea of being serious about digital media is trying
to question the assumptions, not accept the default values, as it were, as
you say, and try to make of this media something less claw-like.

Well, David, you get many types. The Internet is pretty widespread these
days.

Traditional publishing just wasn't working for me. Never did. I can respect
the little magazines and the print publishers, but publishing in the mags
and publishing books of poetry was just not what i wanted to do, though i
wanted to be a poet.

So when the Web came around, it was like Gawd's little toenail had dropped
in my lap. Poet. Programmer. Audio guy. Tries hard at visual art. You can
try to put it all together and publish it for the world to see, if they can
find it and give a rat's behind about it.

Progress? Conquest of the world? Well.

I think it's more about trying to grow artistically and personally as an
artist and, if it helps people acquire a sense of progressive possibility
for doing stuff with the Internet and with computers, that is hopefully
beneficial. Computers aren't going away. Unless we destroy the environment
and civilization collapses and we run with the dogs once again. Which of
course is a possibility. And nuclear war. Or a worsening of the rich/poor
gap. Now is bad enough. And it's even worse in many countries.

It's true the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer.

But in places like China, the net is quite restricted. Open communications
and information gathering is important to any possib of anything worth
calling freedom. And the Internet has an important place in that.

Yes, lots of good code workers, as you say. But it's not all for the corps,
David. You're on the net too. And writing well to make some contribution to
a different type of net. And you're not the only one.

I visited Brazil last year and saw some of the poverty in Sao Paulo and Rio.
Brazil is amazing. But the gatedness of it, the divide between not only rich
and poor but even middle class and poor. My friend's apartment building had
an electric fence and a guard. And he's certainly not rich.

You spend a lot of time composing these thoughtful, moving pieces, David. I
am very grateful for that. I wish my response was as good.

Hopefully digital poetry is not a repeat of Italian Futurism. Perhaps we
have progressed beyond it. Or perhaps time is skewed. The past and the
present and the future intermingled in an odd way. So that Italian Futurists
are still alive. Darwinism heretical, here and there. Right is might here
and there. Corporate feudal medievalism growing.

Yet you try to do what you can in a more progressive direction.

I try to sing the songs that are in me to sing, such as they are, strange
code pieces. It isn't enough but it's what I do.

 Though it seems curiously truncated at the end, there is a favorable, enthusiastic review of Mark Scroggin's biography of Louis Zukofksy in the Sunday New York Times Book Review.

 Would also suggest taking a look John Latta's recent blog posts on the Scroggins bio.
 http://isola-di-rifiuti.blogspot.com/
  Latta goes after it (enthusiastically) a bit more like a humming bird in a flower farm - but, as usual, I find Latta much better on the works that he loves, rather than when he is all tangled up with love-hate resentments of Lang-Po - or so it seems to me -  in his readings of the Grand Piano series. But credit due, it is good to see somebody with such visceral responses to the act of reading -

Very very sorry about the delay; we're still working on moving in down
here (West Virginia) and I've had a lot of writing to do.

I haven't seen it, but there _is_ something about miniaturization that's
important here. I'm currently writing on avatars in Second Life, and the
fact is they're small, and one generally sets the camera above and behind
one's avatar - this plays into a psychoanalytics of framing (something
that Bachelard might write about) and 'corners,' I think. It's not so much
control as maternal projection that's involved - the miniaturization
creates a matrix that's safe; there are hiding-places but no enemies, and
the trains have the promise of continuous running. To the extent that the
sets are placed in the past, there's both a safer period (safer because
encapsulated) presencing itself, and often a tie to one's own childhood;
many of us had toy trains as children.

Duration, yes, but not palaces. The stations were often, once outside NY
and other larger cities, fairly simple in structure; I have a lot of
images from West Virginia past for example.

Oddly, steam engines weren't built for duration; they were more like
living creatures. Once fired up, they were never turned off, not even in
the roundhouse - not unless something needed replacing (boiler, tubes,
etc.). If they needed to be turned off, it took a day to cool and another
to refire, and both cooling and refiring strained the metal tremendously.

But in our mythic past, of course, they did last forever... As far as
shinkansen go - to me, even having ridden one, they _are_ mythic - just
look at the landscape wheeling around, their unearthly quality, the
airplane-smoothed outer skin, the silence...

Oh just that the originals were 6 megabytes and too large for the Web.

I'm not sure, but it sounds something like Bataille's surplus economy. I
think photography doesn't _have_ an inhering, inherency, except for an act
of translation from 3- to somewhat still or silent 2- dimensions; other-
wise one gets involved in thinking about ontologies or epistemologies that
are quickly outmoded - the way silver photographers sometimes feel caught
behind the digital locomotive...

You might want to look at Eco's almost impenetrable A Theory of Semiotics,
which is still, I think, the best work I've read on sign systems. And yes,
I agree with you re: above.

Of course one could argue the opposite, that the frame is all that
remains.

Murat, my simple response to you is to simply ask you to produce any
poem devoid of technology.  Even if we get to an oral tradition, we're
still a species deeply immersed in tool use.  And that sort of thing
isn't even limited to the human species.  And memory seems to be
powerfully virtual and we know memory seems not only to be a property of
many species it seems to be a property wholly inseparable from the body.
  This body remembers to the point where differentiating between the
virtual and the real becomes absurd.

That is to say, there's a triviality about technology in poetry as with
perhaps anything involving human language. While it's true that a lot of
new media crit does not involve overt rejections of the stances of
others, it's also true that (a) there's not really a lot of it, and (b)
it's not exactly established as part of common critical discourse.  Now
while quite a bit of new media criticism focusing on poetics seems to
focus on form and, worse, affirmation of one's theory at the expense of
actually testing one's theory, it's a new area begging for intelligent
voices to actually construct what is "new media criticism" and that
might even involve the removal of the "new" and maybe even "media" as
well.  Criticism has plenty of room for people to re-observe the
triviality of technology (or to do anything really).  reobserve it,
dance it, sing it, throw it, etc.

Maybe I'm biased because of the classes I've been lucky enough to be
able to teach.  Maybe I'm biased because I was engaged in this sort of
artistic production before I ever heard of the term "code poetry."  Or
because I have been writing code for over 25 years.  Maybe I'm biased
because I like mez's work and found myself engaged in a personal
dialogue with Alan's work at the earliest stages of my artistic
production.  But this practice is embodiment enough, evidence enough, of
its rightful place in art.  And any further efforts to separate the
technological from the artistic only insist that we as artists show how
these things really aren't different (while of course doing other things
with our art as well).  And while I've also been skeptical, parodic,
etc., of such code work, or rather, Lester has been parodic, skeptical,
etc., it's also been parody that I hope has been infused with a sense of
both fatality and love.

Code poetry is a reflection of continued change of the human species.
We inscribe ourselves with everything that we are or encounter.
Neuroscience teaches us that what we fire is what we wire and what we
wire is nothing less than what we embody, what we sprout, what we grow,
we vine-like creatures, even if we are to reduce materialism to a
near-zero role.  We experience the Bosporus and that experience writes
itself into us by virtue of smelling it, seeing it, hearing it, or even
experiencing a poem about it.  That the code is to be preferred over the
Bosporus is subject to some extent to how much we are wired into code.
I have been inscribed deeply by both code and the beauty of turquoise
waters serving as some apparent global nexus and so I see poetic
potential in both things as I do perhaps in everywhere.  In fact I think
that the less likely something is to be perceived as poetic, the better
that thing is to be engaged with in a poetic way.  But ultimately what
we are plainly talking about underneath all of this is whether one's
experience of the world has been through code or *is code.*  Everything
else I wrote up to that last sentence has been to help make sense of
that last sentence.

Your friend
Patrick

DISCRETENESS: A SURVEY
A Supplement to
Sound & Event: Special Issue on Poetry

Hark! Poets, Readers:

We are looking for brief discursive engagements with any of the poets'
audio files available at online archives such as PennSound, ubuweb.com,
kswnet.org, slought.org, or with any other poets' recordings. We are open
to serious and also to playful treatments of sound and event -- the
temporal dimension -- in poetry, for a Supplement to our international
Sound & Event issue of ESC: English Studies in Canada.
ings!
Length: 250 to 1,250 words
Audio clip to accompany text is encouraged!
Timeline: before 29 Feb.

Please send texts as RTF file attachments to all three editors: Louis
Cabri (lcabri@uwindsor.ca), Aaron Levy (alevy@slought.org), Peter
Quartermain (quarterm@interchange.ubc.ca).

*  *  *  *

Sound. What is it? In writing, reading, listening. Do you sound out what
you write and read? and what you listen to? What does that mean, to sound
out? A gesture? What sort? Where is that sound on the page? How is that
sound on the page?

Is sound a figure of speech? an -emic trend? a social material in words?
divisible into words? Does sound exist prior to, or through, or even
despite words' formation, or exist only in letters, syllables, morphemes,
syntactic categories? Is sound part of the ambience of writing (Pound's
wordless rhythmical humming)? What ambience?

What is sound as an aesthetic dimension of writing that links to past
rhythmical and rhyming traditions? What is the musicality of poetry's
"real thing"?

What is poetic sound as a subjective state? or as a descriptive, empirical
dimension of language as language in poetry?

Is sound the oratorical aspect of the reading performance, and the open
window? Which reading performance? When? The motor and acoustics of the
body? Which body? Where? When?

Is there influence of specific songs?

Is the sound not gendered? How?

Speech and speech alone? Noise alone? Noise inside speech alone?

The mimological, the Cratylian of language, onomatopoeic and phonosemantic
mimicry by sound itself embodying meaning? Sound as system in poetry?

What is or has been an important sound for you as a poet in any of your
work? Does the internet medium in itself impressionistically suggest today
a particular quality of sound or of soundlessness?

A mix of the above? Some other mix? An other?

Audio demonstrations welcome; a cd will accompany this special issue.

I met my Baby, out behind the Gaz-Works


You don't often think of your body unless you're thinking of your body.
It's there and even when you think of it, you're incarnated, presenced.
You're presenced all the time. Sign off Second Life and you're gone.
That's the ground state, disappearance. In SL your bodies intended,
there's nothing given but the slate. Whatever is added parallels cinema
and the mise en scene - nothing is left to chance unless chance is
determined, built-in. But it's the projections that fundamentally
characterize it - introjections from SL body to organism, projections from
organism to SL body. Think of this as jectivity, an uncanny relationship
which escapes determination, which flirts with abjection. The SL body is a
body that is witnessed, except for the somewhat clumsy 'mouselook' which
places you within it; the mouselook eerily bends the landscape while the
framework monitor remains static. There's always background going on in or
within/without SL; jectivity operates through a normalization that behaves
as dream-screen - for jectivity to occur, the SL/organism interface must
appear coherent, cohering - an inhabitation or dwelling beyond building.
Gaz breaks through this in a way that would be illicit in the world of
organism, of course; pulled or distended limbs in the latter would be a
form of torture or death. One might still speak of self-image and perhaps
drugs which alter it, even the appearance of the physical scaffolding of
the organic body, but Gaz does this with what one postulates, again as a
kind of background radiation, as a normal state which is a state of
absence.

All of this is too neat and I'd argue further a few things - first, that
body and mind are always already both 'real' and 'virtual,' the computer
monitor appearing within this almost as afterthought - and second, that
culture, which is interlaced with intentionality, occurs all the way down
and across - not only from amoeba to, say, bird (with destructive humans
halfway across this continuum), but also from carbon- to silicon- based
lifeform which would include both amoeba and computer, if not the internal
combustion engine. I speak of spew and emissions - of signifiers which
ride across and above the surfaces of what's really going on - the true
world - and it's these signifiers that are subtextual operatives within
Second Life and art- or culture- working in Second Life, which is coding,
coded, recoding, writing, rewriting, and wryting itself constantly -
wryting being the implicit inhering relationship of inscriptive to the
body, bodily inscription and inscriptive body coalescing and coalesced
from the very beginning.

Think of edges of worlds and bodies; Second Life adds two new constants:
height (evidenced in flying) and gameworld boundaries, for example at the
bottom of the ocean where everything is transformed, and moving forward
out of the gamespace results in asymptotic returns to the interior. Camera
movement can distance you from the avatar; one can move within, beneath,
above, within her. There are at least two positions of inherent interest.
In the first, the camera leaves the avatar altogether, in order to peer
beneath the gamespace or elsewhere across forbidden zones, and in the
second, the camera appears within the avatar body - a view that brings the
sheaves/prims to the foreground, not goreground, as the avatar dissolves
into empty space. Gaz' reach extends, appears to extend, of course it
doesn't and can't, outside the gamespace altogether (a point in an expand-
ing universe is still within an expanding universe) - this is an inversion
of a caveworld, transformed into private plateau. Again the physics are
odd, exposing the Second Life universe as non-isotropic whatsoever - as a
construct within which worlding occurs and within/without which the true
world operates as it does, ontologically and epistemologically, everywhere
we are, can think of, within and without jectivity.

Now there are issues of entrapment, reminiscent of current RIAA stuff; Gaz
insists that one's body in Second Life is not one's own, and that jectiv-
ity in the same is only artifact, in fact mitigated by Linden Labs, at
best. S/he's a gadfly or parasitic (in Serres' sense of cultural producer)
about the game (as one is a man or woman 'about the town'). So one's
behavior in the vicinity of a Gazwork, gasworks (think of Bhopal) is not
one's own, either; the distortions and entrapments, the weighings-down,
are not of one's making, but of one's wandering into a work such that the
wandering becomes the catalyst or primordial state of the work.

Not always, but almost always, avatars are smaller than one's physical
body, or appear so. And one's viewpoint is not always, but almost always,
above and behind the avatar, slightly raised - as if one's watching a
soccer game, which for a spectator can be senseless from a ground-based
camera. I think this kind of miniaturization tends towards a maternal
reading of the world, a reading within which the image on the screen forms
a safe matrix; after all, the computer goes on and off, games and software
are replaced or updated, and both the world and you go on. So here's this
safe world, and jectivity or what one might call the 'jectivity-braid' -
the braid of psychoanalytic renderings, readings and writings, introjec-
tions and projections, dreamings and hallucinatings, all before or within
and without the screen - this braid is taken for granted; it's the safe-
house of the world, transforming the world and the true world into a
habitus. As a result of peering and miniaturization among other things.
And the ability to chat and keep or erase chat. And the ability to fly or
teletransport, playing into Freud's condensation/displacement in the
dreamwork. Second Life is a _pun_ in this regard - one place quickly sub-
stituted for another, and such substitutions revolutionary or disrupting
as one landscape disappears, another appears - perhaps throwing everything
off but just for a (very safe) moment. It's the safety in punning that
makes them revolutionary, and the same safety occurs in relation and
through the braid. So again, when Gaz takes a meta-position in relation to
this relation, when Gaz appears apparently half-in and half-out of the
gamespace, the disruptive becomes difficult to absorb, becomes something
that doesn't happen in the real (except perhaps with sado-masochism and
the use of safewords which break out of one theater into another). It's a
contradiction which can't be absorbed. And to return to one's "own" avatar
body after Gaz' distortion, one logs out of Second Life - in other words
out of the fundamental world, what is _being_ the fundamental world - into
another world with its real dangers, etc. - the world of the inert or
'idiotic' real (Rosset).

So that the space-time slice within which your body is distorted must be
abandoned. So that one returns and in this return, like the prodigal
daughter or sun, the body is made w/hole again, just like in the MOOs and
MUDs and various adventure games which are the history of all these spaces
and WOW and whatnot. (I want to mention briefly my own work here, which is
concerned with inconceivable positionings of one's own avatar, position-
ings within which behaviors pile on behaviors, creating 'behavior colli-
sions' that create, for the viewer (distinct from the performer), a
disturbing and/or dis/eased representation of the body, an abject body
that indicates something else other the normative is occurring, something
that can't be absorbed. With Gaz, this occurs first-person - the change is
to _me_ and my image/imaginary; with my work, it's third-person and in a
sense stains or transforms the mise en scene into something abject and
unexpected.)

To conclude on a mundane note - There are two things that distinguish Gaz'
works as well as Second Life, and are critical for contemporary theory, to
the extent that contemporary theory is critical. First, the latter: When-
ever people talk about an experience in Second Life, they talk as if
they're _in the world_: "I just wandered around and didn't see much." "I
talked to some people and a bird flew overhead and grabbed me." "I was
teleported to the Odyssey Gallery and saw an amazing work there, well, not
actually _saw,_ but experienced." "I kept looking for someone but all I
found were empty spaces." And so forth. So the _experience_ of SL melds
with experience otherwise (or the same), and this doesn't happen with
other online experiences, except of course games and other social spaces.
We adapt quickly to the screen, we're braided to the screen, and this
permits the creation of artworks and environments that simply have no
parallel elsewhere: "I entered this house and it flew away." "I turned
myself from a forty-year-old man into a sexy twenty-year-old." "I couldn't
get lose from the bird until I logged out and in again." "I was buried in
paintings." "Records played by themselves." "I flew." We say these things
as if they're everyday, as if they were always possible. "Question-marks
were falling everywhere." Sometimes the servers are hacked or slowed up,
but even this can be absorbed until everything grinds to a halt, and then
one just logs out, waits, logs in again. This logging-out/logging-in has
become an integral part of SL, in fact, just as online/offline otherwise
is integral to being in a post-industrial world. (I do want to point out
that this isn't, naturally, the only world - the world outside the matrix
or braid is characterized by intense poverty, local wars, starvations, and
so forth, and SL is powerless in relation to these; one might argue in
fact that SL is too much of a safe haven, that it detracts from real
praxis and real difference in the true world. And there's truth to this.)

The second, related, thing in conclusion, is Gaz' works themselves; as I
pointed out above, the behaviors they trigger couldn't occur outside
gamespace without bodily destruction - and some of the behaviors couldn't
occur at all. So these behaviors, these works, are absolutely unique in
this respect; they depend on both a reading of the SL environment as
'natural,' and a scripting within and of that environment to produce the
'unnatural' which is still read as natural. These works, on this level,
question the authority of the real, of the idiotic real; they're a kind of
critique that couldn't exist anywhere else. The viewer/participant isn't
prepared for them. (UPS trucks falling on one!) So one engages both crit-
ically and psychologically/psychoanalytically - the works create both
contemplation and affect, in ways we're not used to. And that, at least
for me, is one of the highest goals of art - to create that sense of
dis/comfort that gives us a place to question everything, and to return
from that questioning hopefully wiser. On a personal note, I can't say
I've found anything as intriguing as Gaz' works, anywhere, and for a long
time, and I'm still fathoming out the implications, still feeling the
limbs extended almost to the breaking-point. Gaz is a pioneer in the body
and space of the Other - and perhaps nothing more need have been said than
that.

Dear Poetics List Folks: =20


I will be teaching a poetry workshop in NYC/Queens this spring and I have r=
oom in it for three or four more students. I'd appreciate it if you could f=
orward this description to interested parties.


Thanks,
Lisa Jarnot


A Winter Workshop in Sunnyside, Queens. From the Archives. 10 weeks. $300. =
Saturdays 12-3, beginning February 9th. A workshop making use of a variety =
of archival material (Sound recordings such as lectures by Robert Duncan, V=
ancouver Conference seminars, Readings by the Lang crowd at the Ear Inn, ra=
re Spicer tapes, Creeley recordings, Ted Berrigan and Clark Coolidge chatti=
ng while high, Helen Adam singing ballads, Films by Kenneth Anger and Stan =
Brakhage, NET Educational TV poetry series from the 60s with O'Hara and so =
on, copies of rare publications and books, cross-genre forms: recordings of=
 Lenny Bruce alongside recordings of Allen Ginsberg, etc., the audio-tape o=
f RDuncan's Faust Foutu Play, 1954 SF, etc., Cornell films). The show-and-t=
ell aspect of the workshop would be accompanied by writing/project exercise=
s related to what we're doing: e.g.=E2=80=94 write a comedy sketch poem, co=
nsider the line breaks and punctuation in your poems as notation for the pe=
rformance of the work, write a Scottish border ballad, collaborate on a poe=
t's theater play, etc. There would also be time to focus in on works-in-pro=
gress by each of the students. To register for this class, contact Lisa Jar=
not at ljarnot@gmail.com

Hi Murat,

here is part of the 'larger story' of poetry and computers. to me, anyway.

mcluhan and others have observed that the tools we use (language itself is a
technology if we consider technologies to be tools made by people) become
part of us more deeply than we realize, sometimes. it's been said of
language that language draws a magic circle round the realm of thinkable
thought. whether this is true or not, that it is by no means probability=0
tells us something about the profound influence of language on thought.

mcluhan and others have written about technologies as extensions of the
body. or the memory. or our cognitive capacities. the microscope and
telescope as extensions of the ability of the eye. the book as an extension
of memory.

the tools we use change what we see of the world. change how we see the
world. change what we make of it.

it takes some time to make these extensions of ourselves part of our
humanity. as opposed to them being metal claws with no feeling. no subtlety.
no full human articulation.

we are using computers. we will use computers. in many more ways than we are
now. computers are universal machines; they can simulate any conceivable
machine whatsoever. they or their descendant devices will be with us until
there is no more civilization. and they will continue to be used in an ever
expanding number of ways.

we have to get a feel for them. we have to make these extensions of
ourselves part of our humanity in the same way we make language part of our
humanity. because they are going to--already are--playing the same sort of
role as language, are involved in our sense of language, also. and who we
are. what we are.

there is no more human an art than poetry, with its intense engagement with
language. i remember an old teacher of mine speaking about a student of his,
saying that the student had not yet learned to feel with the language. that
is an important part of poetry.

i try to create language machines in which you can feel for yourself what it
means for software to be literary and fully human in the way that poems can
be fully human.

we need to be able to tell the difference between a metal claw and the human
hand. how can we feel through these things if we don't know such
differences?

and if we can't tell the difference, how are we to be fully human in our use
of these things?

 is the opposite of the "Projections" of=0AJenny Holzer, which go hand in h=

f the electricities --the Electricity of Illumination and=0A"Projections" a=
nd the Electricity of Shock and Prisons--is an "update" of=0Athe "electric =
code" war between Westinghouse and Edison in the latter part=0Aof the 19th =
Century.  Though he was  neither pro nor con the death penalty=0Anor the us=
e of electricity for it, Edison became an (elaborately=0Aunderhanded) advoc=
ate of the use of A/C current over hanging and the=0Aguillotine as a method=
 of dispatching those judged deserving.  A/C was the=0Aproduct of his rival=
 Westinghouse--Edison supported this in order to further=0Athe public image=
 of his D/C current as the "Safe" one.  Westinghouse would=0Abe the Bringer=
 of Death, the Shock Doctrine, the Prison coded  Electric=0AChair Provider,=
 the  Power Behind Old Sparky's Throne,  and Edison the=0Abenevolent "Proje=
ctions," and electric light bulb provider.  "Let there be=0Alight" as oppos=

nd--all play a part=0Ain this area of things)=0A=0A=0AMurat I thoroughly en=
joy and know this of language you write of.  It's in=0Athe Burroughs quote =
I used re a glossary of a language whose intentions are=0Afugitive and in a=
 lot of poetry in cultures the world round.  Chaucer and=0AVillon spring to=
 mind, for example.  Often, where i live, we have=0Aconversations using wor=
ds which sound like "normal everyday words" to an=0Aoutsider" but to us hav=
e a completely different meaning.  I'ts the art of=0Aspeaking night thought=
s in broad daylight. The language of the "world within=0Athe world."  A fri=
end was visiting one day and listened to us having a=0Aconversation for abo=
ut ten minutes.  Later he remarked what a pleasant event=0Ait seemed we had=
 been talking about and what a nice time we must have had.=0AActually we we=
re discussing a body found laid out neatly as a sign beside a=0Adumpster ki=
tty corner to here, shot execution style, to differentiate it=0Afrom a guy =
shot the other day in the street not as an execution.  I saw that=0Aevent w=
hen going to buy cigarettes, about forty feet away from me.  And only=0Afro=
m the back.  And only in code, so to speak.  We had also been discussing=0A=
the rise in price of cigarettes and bus tickets.  All of it impenetrable to=
=0Amy friend, and just as well.=0A=0A        Actually one could say that "c=
ode is the subject" of itself in such=0Aworks as Illuminated Manuscripts an=
d examples such as the Alhambra.   The=0Acalligraphies and images which are=
 within the lettering and borders of=0Ailluminated Manuscripts contain furt=
her meanings which are forms of codes=0Aboth "a part of" and "apart from" i=
n a supplementary sense.  In the=0AAlhambra, the caligraphies are both writ=
ten texts and mathematical formulae,=0Athere is a doubling carrying of code=
s.  Reading some of the examples in the=0Ajournal noted, what one finds is =
not that he ideas are new, but simply that=0Athe medium being used is diffe=
rent.  Long before Morse code poems for=0Aexample, there were semaphore poe=
ms, made by the international codes using=0Aflags from ship to ship or hill=
 to hill--I imagine many smoke signal poems=0Aand also mirror flashing poem=
s among messages transmitted at a distance by=0Athese, let alone carrier pi=
geon poems, the first Air Mail Art being borne=0Aaloft in this manner also.=
=0A=0A      "A poem can be made of anything" as WC Williams wrote.  One cou=
ld take=0Athe junk on this table and arrange it a myriad ways as poems, or =
take a=0Abunch of identical plates or cups out of a cupboard and arrange th=
em in=0Avarious patterns as "lines", with spacings suggestive of "pauses" a=
nd=0A"accents" and "volumes."=0A=0A      Murat and I are interested in the =
ways in which language camouflages=0Aan identity  so that it may appear to =
"assimilate" for reasons of survival,=0Aas well as means of resistance.  Co=
des at one level have to do with "value"=0Ain terms of the "status" of the =
"object"--for example bar codes and ISBN=0Anumbers.  In the computer inform=
ation world, codes such as these are shifted=0Aon to persons in as many way=
s as there are codes for determining angles of=0Avalue determination.  New =
forms of camouflaging and resisting will be=0Adeveloped just as quickly as =
new methods of "identifying" and "profiling"=0Aare.=0A    As the then Sovie=
ts and now Americans are discovering in Afghanistan,=0Atheir seeming comple=
te superiority in technology and communications over the=0AAfghans was and =
is routinely  undermined by a communications system based on=0Athe delivery=
 of messages by runners, the most ancient of methods.=0A=0A      For over a=
 decade now my visual poetry, mail art etc has been made=0Awith found mater=
ials and at one point I had the ironic and hilarious=0Aexperience of receiv=
ing a Mail Art journal with an essay I had written on my=0AStreet sources w=
hile I was  as it were removed from the streets for a=0Aperiod, and learnin=
g how to find materials in the most limited situations.=0AMaking do for lon=
g periods without email or even a phone, tv and ignoring=0Athe radio.=0A=0A=
  I think what one learns from this experience is that the world is as yet=
=0Aunread and unwritten in so many ways because in a sense persons have bee=
n=0Alosing an ability to read and write independently in many ways due to t=
he=0Adependence on the codes via being plugged into machines ultimately=0Ac=
ontrolled by others.=0A=0A    The kind of skepticism Murat and I have towar=
ds this embrace of codes is=0Athat all too often codes are applied to perso=
ns, and persons have to in turn=0Adecode and recode the codes in order to b=
oth survive and resist.   Poetry is=0Aa gathering together of many strange =
elements which peculiarly enough   are=0Anamed among the living, as actuali=
tes, as Savino demonstrated, and in turn,=0Ausing his example, is not Troy =
located in Turkey and Murat from Turkey?   And=0AI am writing from Milwauke=

nd "secret," the "proof of Troy," the "New=0AExtreme Experimental American =
Poetry" in which Curveball and Moe Berg play a=0Apart, along with Thomas Ed=
ison and Westinghouse, Naomi Klein and Savinio,=0ASciasia, the Italian Lett=
er, forgeries, Emily Dickinson and car bombings,=0ARoberto Bolano and 9/11 =
and much much else.=0A=0A=0Ahere's part of the Burroughs--=0A=0A      Burro=
ughs' cut-ups, unlike the productions of the machines online=0Athat one can=
 use to do cut-ups as though "not by oneself," are methods of=0Amaking a "m=
inority of one" which via camouflages, masks, "being obvious,"=0Aessays sur=
vival as an intact writer. "The Death of the Author" so beloved of=0AAuthor=
s, for this kind of writer has already been experienced near-literally=0Aan=

ter--and so the camouflages, disguises, masks, "role playing" and=0Aheteron=
yms, "alter egos."=0A=0AIn Burrogghs' cut-ups--the cut-up uses texts to rev=

outside oneself," which one "lets in" via "destruction=0Aof the ego" throug=

=0Abeing of the Middle Ages in his thinking regarding "psychology."  (He ha=
d=0Aafter all studied for a year in Vienna after graduating from Harvard.) =
  It=0Ais NOT the "ego" which one wants to get away from but the forces out=
side one=0Awhich try to destroy one's being, take control of it and use it =
for their=0Apurposes.  The writer's activity is a guerrilla one against bei=

 complicities=0Awith the conspiracies of  Control.=0A=0AIn the Introduction=
 to the first edition of Junkie, which is reprinted in=0Alater printings, B=

 the book:  "Therefore a final glossary cannot be made of=0Awords whose int=

law--an agent "posing" inside=0Athe imposed "seemingly random" cover of Con=
trol.  The secret agent/intrepid=0Areporter/private investigator/"Inspector=

"evidence" to be used  not simply=0Afor "cutting up" but--as Burroughs make=
s clear--arranging, editing, creating=0Athe "Files" which make use of the j=

as to be making an ongoing=0A"fugitive" language which at once perceives an=

-but a series of=0A"identities" which are 'disguises" and "camouflages" suc=

sobriquets "pictured"=0Ahim.  The writer participates in a series of anonym=
ous, heteronymous,=0Apseudonymous and invented personas" parts," "roles," "=
charcters."  This is=0Anot to destroy the "identity" of the writer at the c=
ore, but to preserve the=0Awriter in order to continue writing for writing =
is the means of survival in=0Aa world in which both the "seemingly random" =
and the "obvious' are bent on=0Amaintaining their control over one.=0A=0ATh=
e great Jazz musician Don Cherry used to very often say--"Free Jazz can=0Ao=
nly be played by superbly disciplined musicians."  Burroughs' years of work=
=0Awith the cut ups in texts, images, sound recordings, film--this has=0Aaf=
finities with Rimbaud's "long reasoned derangement of the senses" in order=
=0Ato arrive at the Unknown," which for Burroughs is the being always a ste=
p=0Aahead of the Control, of Language.  For Burroughs this to make possible=
 not=0Aonly travel in space, but travel in time for the writer.=0A=0ABurrou=
ghs was always precise on the point that no work was done when he was=0Ausi=
ng drugs.  Drugs are Control which wipes out the writer. Tabula rasa.=0AHav=
ing been a long term addict like Burroughs, it was only after one gets=0Aaw=
ay from that Control, that one enters writing--and why writing is very=0Adi=
fferent from  becoming "outside" to oneself--it is the means to find a way=
=0Ato exist as oneself--to survive--what one knows of the Forces of Control=
.=0AIt is that necessity of survival  the necessity that is the motherfucke=
r of=0Ainvention that is involved with the fugitive, "outlaw," "outsider" a=
spect of=0Awriting, the need for the "undercover" aspects, and the reason w=
hy so much=0Athat one finds around does not appear to one as it does to oth=
ers. It is too=0Asee what is hidden in plain site/sight/cite and at the sam=
e time see how=0Amany things that "seem" to be  "liberating" are disguised =
traps, or inside=0Aout reflections of what they purport to be the opposite =
of, in opposition=0Ato.  Often the concept of "opposition" itself can be us=
ed as a diversion=0Afrom what is the overall issue of Control and an essay =
at understanding and=0Arecognising as much as possible its manifestations.=
=0A=0AAn aspect of this is the breaking down seemingly of voices in which J=
im=0Anotes  "all characters seem to be one."    The key is that they "seem"=
 to be=0A"one."  From the point of view of the writer, they are not one, bu=
t many,=0Aand constitute a swarm.  The swarm is camouflaged by this "seemin=
g" to be=0Aone--if it is simply "one" then it can be easily crushed.  The m=
ultiple=0A"identities" of the writer creates such a swarm, a way of continu=
ally being=0A"a minority of one" "on the move"  whose "intentions are fugit=
ive"--a=0A"minority of one" whose intentions are to appear now as "one," no=
w as=0A"another," and in turn as a swarm which may appear to the eyes of Co=
ntrol as=0A"one."=0A=0AKurt Schwitters is one of the truly profound "cut-up=
" artists--and his=0Acollage "method" was to use what he found in the stree=
t.  Again, Picasso's=0A"I do not seek, I find."  This is Burroughs' method =
in the cut-ups--he used=0Athe found texts of newspapers, things found in th=

 edited cut-ups, which he put=0Athrough many transumuttations of his own cu=
tting and pasting by hand--and=0Athe n arranging--along side the passages f=
rom his dream journals, and others=0Afrom the memories which were stimulate=
d in turn by the collaged cut-ups and=0Adreams and fictions, poetry of othe=
r writers.  This for=0ABurroughsconstitutes the writer's method of time tra=
vel--to be able to=0Atravel among=0Amemory, dream, imagined places and pers=
ons, factually recorded ones known=0Aand unknown to the writers and so crea=
te extensions of fugitive=0A=0AAs Burroughs writes in the Intro to Queer--w=
riting is for him a matter of=0Alife and death.  On the day that he shot hi=
s wife, he feels that the forces=0A"outside" were in Control, and the use o=
f drugs was the allowing of Control=0Ato reduce him to zombie sitting on th=
e edge of his bed staring at his foot=0Afor what was a period in which time=
 is "junk time" only measured by the=0Adrops from the syringe, the injected=

e dope peddlers, snitches,=0Athieves, punks and assorted "low life" and "cr=

 verison in a sense of the=0AMedieval Carnival, in which the masks fall awa=
y and the Emperor really has=0Ano clothes, Death walks nonchalantly in broa=
d daylight, the Sins come out to=0Aplay, and the monstrous buffoons that ar=
e the forces of Order are for a day=0Aor a few truly Buffoons.  That is the=
 meaning of "Naked Lunch"--the title=0Afrom Kerouac's saying that it was th=
e moment when indeed what was on the=0Aforks was seen for what it is--not u=
nlike the scene of The Last Supper in=0ABunuel's Viridiana, the Feast of th=

era eye" as the "recorder" of=0A"posterity"  that "degrades"not only the La=
st Supper, but particularly its=0Arepresentations.  In a sense, this method=
 destroys not what is the Last=0ASupper itself but the use of its represent=
ations as methods of Control   The=0Awoman's "camera" image "exposes" the d=
egeneration and diseased ("Word=0AVirus") "state of the image" and "image o=
f the state" as a "rotting=0Aedifice".  (A leper--literally a "rotting one,=
"  plays prominent part in all=0Aof this, including the violating of Viridi=
ana, the former Nun now a secular=0A"doer of good."  Among the "rotting edi=

 to speak.  A reporter does not necessarily become=0A"more objective" and "=

Subject:      Thumb-typed cellphone novels dominate Japanse bestsellers--re
              codes & technologies & criticism--
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Thank you Jim Murat and Patrick for your letters

speaking of codes and access--i was put off the cable access for the last
two-three days
it's been below zero here in Milwaukee so you can slice notations in the
ground for rubBEings--which are very neat, no spillage,  the earth is so
hard--
growing up in Vermont, walking in the country side in the deep freezes in
January, clap your hands, one clap--and the sound waves  carrying through
space snap the frozen and ice covered branches off trees--

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/world/index.html?th&emc=th ---

this article on cellphone novels is very fraught with possibilities and
novel ideas,  some bordering on novelty--
the new cell phone text message vocabulary with its very limited, very short
sentences, and the use of emoticons--hard to read for those over 25 years
old--("don't trust anyone over 25")-and for purists has to be written only
on the cell phone--practitioners who move on to composing on the computer
noticeably gain in vocabulary--

the small vocabulary is a bit like that in Orwell's 1984, though the use of
emoticons keeps if from being as limited emotionally--gives it a touch a
"visual poetry"--
also one writes with only the thumb--

minimization of the "digits" of the hand--no "digits"!

the paradox that this paring down to the thumbed-only text message smattered
with emoticons should be producing not haiku-like poems but block buster
novels, chockfull of the most over-coded, overladen emotions is an
interesting reflection on the media involved.  The telephone, the the typed
message, the grafik novels that influence these cellphone novels, all meet
in these torrents of small, simple sentences, turning units of brevity into
an extended narrative drama by the continual addition of events without the
interruption of replies.   The "interactivity of the media is transformed
into a separate sphere.

what's interested me in the history of technologies and of codes and the
codes in discussion here--is how quick "human nature" is to recognize in
every technology and code the aspects to be used "to advantage," the
"criminal " aspects--which in turn affect the developments of further
"security" aspects--

there's also the inexplicable drive to make things which finds codes as it
goes along, and finds beauty, poetry, subversion, humor in the puns,
paradoxes, hypocrisies or obdurate existences of what may appear to anyone
but the artist as a "blank" code--as in a lot of Art Brut--

t
as Paul Virilio has written numerous times, each technology produces a new
form of the Accident--so each new form of code produces its new forms of
security, surveillance, secrecy, espionage--new possibilities for propaganda
and the mass media  dissemination of the "transparent" and "obvious" which
actually are "loaded" images and words--

what interests me are the ways that across the uses made of codes one finds
very strange bed fellows as it were--

i agree with Patrick that there as yet doesn't really exist much writing on
code poetry,. code literature--and that is shoulnd't have words like "new"
and "media" in it--(it would be like those old textbooks on "new media"
post-McLuhan)--
i personally don't posses the knowledge to undertake his--

so what i have been working with which is related with codes are the ways in
which one finds codes already existing around one yet in a peculiar way like
rubBEings, and as rubBEings and paintings,  which are nearly hidden until
one begins working with them and they  begin to appear--as though from
nowhere and yet from the very ground itself--

the codes are symptoms of a language which for some time is telling one of
itself--
the most coded and hidden language is especially that in plain sight, the
most obvious--

the code aspect of the emoticon and short sentence transmitted as text over
a cell phone-- a visual/written SILENT message transmitted over a machine
designed for the transmission of the VOICE--specifically within a
demographic which doesn't read books but comic books--

brings one back to Burroughs' numerous arguments and examples for the
development of a silent form of visual writing--that is, a language which
would be apprehended without vocalization in reading--and so bring a silence
in to the mind--

yet at the same time the reader is most likely not interested in silence but
in the ipod strapped and plugged into the ears

the text message becomes a further development in the history of the
"epistolary novel" blurring into the more Picaresque forms of the Grafik
novels--
or religious propaganda booklets like those series already found on buses in
comic book styles that could be easily transposed into cell phone books--

another use of technology which becomes almost immediately made use of with
each new kind that appears is propaganda, which has become almost
"invisible"--the obvious as symptom of propaganda in code that one is so
habituated to that one does not recognize it as code--

code has a great ability to generate belief--confidence--"truth"--which
makes it ideal for "cons"--the "hustle"--"disinformation
campaigns"--stockmarket manipulations--(Baudelaire saw this immediately with
the telegraph--)

there;'s also with belief itself the necessity for some things never to be
forgotten and many others to be completely forgotten--so codes need to be
found for indicating and manipulating events and signs to be received in the
proper form of memory--as the never to be forgotten or as the instantly
forgotten--


Writing about the tentatively named "New Extreme Experimental American
Poetry," one can can ask about the significance of the use of the web by
"Curveball," Jenny Holzer and The CIA, all basically for a very similar
purpose.  Because images from the web are believed to be real, in all three
cases, and in the selling to the world by Colin Powell of "Curveball's
story," all are given an unquestioning reception at the time.

(btw i just learned the "chapter" on Waterboarding and Poetry" will be at
Wordforword site--)

    The common denominator seems to be the name of an authority plus the
network equals truth.  And as though an applause button has been generated
in the public, there's an instantaneous "high approval rating."  If the
"approval" can be turned on so easily for war, and later on for work
purporting to be "opposed" to at least war memos-- based on the use of some
internet images--it makes one wonder how coded persons have become in their
thinking, or unthinking responses.  A form of "authoritarianism" is
established unquestioningly, in plain view, and as though "nothing is
happening."

One wonders if Holzer's exhibit, exactly the same, had instead a different
artist's name on it.  Someone unknown, or someone who was purprosrted to
have "conservative" political views.  Would this show, exactly the same in
every other way, then be taken to be a celebration of Rumsfeld's memos?
         One possibility of doing some pieces of the annals of New Extreme
Experimental American poetry is to use video clips, net images, scanned type
written and hand written passages, al manner of different forms and
media--including parodies of theses--there is also the element in which they
are literature in themselves, when fiction enters in and is able create
actions which ignite the strange incendiary meetings of codes that "just
happened to be lying around at the moment."
       The tendency to restrict poetry, code poetry, any poetry, exclusively
to questions of form and formal-related issues, allows poets to convince
themselves this is a "resistance" rather than a "head in the sand" response
to the "transparent" "obvious" codes which none the less are controlling
their thoughts and world more than they will allow themselves to know.  This
is one of the great messages of of code--to make one think one is too smart
to be fooled by it, when one is actually being its puppet. By essaying to
broaden the areas in which code is seen to be interrelated and operative, is
to expand the awareness and possibilites of art work or criticism.

in the rasping of these many worlds

{ on a foreign planet a great claw moves

dark masses echo safety's incarnate form

{ serrated edges hold things in its grasp

imaginary in our sad faltering

{ thud echoes through the mantle up and down

safety in the curling inward home

{ knowing neither home nor sea nor sky

follow down beneath our fulling surface

{ dimly lit and friction takes its course

hiding from the universe and death

{ othering murmurs everywhere abroad

cuddling quietly in endless sleep

{ alive and everywhere and endless claws

always deep below beyond the deep

{ on every planet murmuring and maws

Fascinating and disturbing work, Alan. I found it impossible not to think of
Hans Bellmer ... similar expressions of the dislocations and brutalities of
eroticism - a kind of visual expression of touch, which is always partial,
as opposed to sight, which comprehends. Thanks -

Saturday February 2nd, 7:00 pm
Railyard Performance Center
1611 B Paseo de Peralta, 505-982-8309

Author/Editor/Spoken-Word Performer Harvey Arden along with guest
performers.

Mark Holtzman [aka Silent Bear] will honor the gathering with his music
on the Jan 31 venue only.

These and other dedicated and talented people will offer their personal
thoughts of Leonard Peltier.

Harvey Arden with the passion and spirit in the words of Leonard Peltier
will make the event something not to be missed.

This passionate spoken word performance is based on the Leonard Peltier
book-Prison Writings: My Life Is My Sun Dance.

Prison Writings was written in 1999 by the Native American political
prisoner, Leonard Peltier, whose words were adapted into a powerful
stage-play by his editor, Harvey Arden.

Leonard's words are just as poignant today as when the book first appeared
and deserves the attention of the entire nation.

Leonard's parole hearing is scheduled for December, 2008. Prison Writings
is a collection of Peltier's essays and poems, reflecting his life and his
work from within the prison walls.


Defending his People and being Indian is his only crime.

The cultural traditions of his people connect Leonard and each of us to the
Wakan Tanka--The Great Mystery

This spiritual connection and his personal sacrifice to the Creator keeps
him strong and unbroken. His life is connected to each of us.

Each day this innocent man suffers for his people; in fact,now that you
know his truth, he also suffers for you.

What will you do now?

During the horrific early 1970's Reign of Terror on the Lakota (Sioux)
reservation at Pine Ridge South Dakota, an infamous time of violence and
corruption existed. Complicit tribal officials hired local thugs known as
GOONS --'Guardians of the Oglala Nation', who--with the blessing of the U.S.
Government--carried out an unprovoked series of assaults on the traditional
people on the Pine Ridge reservation. SD.

Behind these attacks was Big Energy's desire for uranium under Sioux lands,
then being secretly negotiated between the U.S. government and compliant
Tribal officials.

Two FBI agents were killed on June 26, 1975 during a gun battle on The
Jumping Bull Property. Leonard Peltier was falsely framed for the murder of
the two FBI agents. The other defendants charged with the same crime had
been acquitted by a jury. They were defending their people from an
unprovoked attack. Self defense--a basic human right--was denied Leonard
Peltier and his legal team.

Following the discovery of new evidence obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act lawsuit. Mr. Peltier demanded a new trial. The Eighth
Circuit court ruled, "There is a possibility that the jury would have
acquitted Leonard Peltier had the records and data improperly withheld from
the defense been made available to him." Yet, the court denied Mr.
Peltier a new trial. The jury sentenced Mr. Peltier to two consecutive life
terms.


Judge Heaney, who authored the decision denying a new trial, has since
voiced firm support for Mr. Peltier's release, stating that:

"The FBI used improper tactics to convict Mr. Peltier".

Judge Heaney also stated that:

"The FBI was equally responsible for the shoot-out, and that Mr.
Peltier's release would promote healing with Native Americans".

So why is this story of Judicial Racism hidden from the public eye?

The late Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama, Amnesty International,
International Indian Treaty Council, the UN High Commissioner on Human
Rights, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Coretta Scott King, Mikhail Gorbachev,
Gloria Steinem, Wilma Mankiller, Robert Redford, the European Parliament,
and a host of other notables all have worked, petitioned, and pleaded for
Leonard Peltier's release.

For the American Indian Nations as well as the world at large, the continued
imprisonment of Leonard Peltier is Americas Judicial embarrassment.

The spirit of the Sun-dancer who is Leonard Peltier confronted with the
treachery and ugliness of life has transcended and has become the message,of
hope, courage, and integrity for his People for his family and each of us.

Peltier has been behind prison bars for more than half of his life (he
turned 63 this past September). He remains a model prisoner, establishing
numerous humanitarian projects within the prison system as well as back on
the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Petitions will be available at both performances appealing for Leonard's
release in his upcoming December 2008 parole hearing (scheduled the last
month of the Bush presidency). If Mr. Peltier is denied release at this
hearing or not granted Presidential clemency-he will not receive another
opportunity for freedom until the 2017 parole hearing. His official release
date is 2041.


Leonard's voice from inside the cage asks you, "What will you do now?"

Be the change, question everything, it's your duty as a citizen.

Be one voice if in your heart you can stand in support.
Join your voice with ours and together we can create change.

I'm very pleased to announce the publication of my first full-length =
poetry collection, Codes of Public Sleep, by Toronto's BookThug. The =
book should win an award for the clever design alone, which features a =
"Yukaghir love letter" on the front and back covers.

=20

Highlights - two longish poems: "call me i" (written on the train The =
City of New Orleans between New Orleans and Chicago) and the title poem, =
"Codes of Public Sleep" (public space and private acts in pre-Katrina =
New Orleans); and several series of shorter poems, many written in =
Toronto, including "at limnic realm," "fabled hue," and "hollow bowl," a =
series of haibun.

Codes of Public Sleep can be purchased from Small Press Distribution:

From the back cover:

Codes of Public Sleep breaks open the code of private thought to modes =
of knowing catastrophe that defy insufficient isolating sagas. Camille =
Martin's poetry is the shattering signal from a laudably wild tongue =
that will not keep still for our death-drive culture. This is a =
remarkable collection - Carla Harryman

Camille

yes, well, thankfully the cell-phone is not the entire range of computing
for young people.

what would it be like if it did voice recognition rather than typing? the
phone messages have to be short and sweet, don't they. the technology
mandates a sort of compression.

but there are interesting things going on with cell phones. there's a type
of art called 'locative media' (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_media ). generally the ones i've heard
about involve gps and cell phones. for instance, one might register to
participate in a local history project. once registered, one's cell phone
beeps when one is close to a site involved in the project; at that point,
one's cell phone shows text and images concerning the site.

a similar sort of gps/cellphone thang is where you register for a local
dating service and your cell beeps when you're within 50 feet of a match.
and then there are hide and seek team games.

to quote from the wikipedia site:

"Locative media is many things: A new site for old discussions about the
relationship of consciousness to place and other people. A framework within
which to actively engage with, critique, and shape a rapid set of
technological developments. A context within which to explore new and old
models of communication, community and exchange. A name for the ambiguous
shape of a rapidly deploying surveillance and control infrastructure."

net art is changing via cell phone networks. with a local emphasis. and a
mobile, location oriented aspect that situates it both virtually and down
home.

CAConrad's ANNUAL SEXIEST POEM OF THE YEAR AWARD FOR 2007 GOES TO...
THE BIG MELT, by President of the United Hearts (Factory School, 2007)
DETAILS HERE:  http://sexiestPOEMaward.blogspot.com<http://sexiestpoemaward.blogspot.com/>

The Sexiest Poem of the Year Award is given annually to a finely crafted
poem demonstrating a fearlessness which confronts injustice.  The panel of
judges is CAConrad sitting in five different chairs manifesting five
different facial expressions.  The judges must have a unanimous decision in
order for the award to be granted.  In the case where a unanimous decision
is not decided upon, no award will be granted that year.

at this point, forgive me for quoting myself. this is from my original post
on 'code poetry':

--

the term "code poetry" is a good one partly because it is open. it isn't a
'school of poetry' made up of a central group. it's poetry that has some
sort of intense engagement with code.

and it opens poetry to types of language and, well, codes, that haven't been
so prominently associated with poetry before.

also, it avoids limiting its focus to computation. it refers as prominently
to matters of language and culture as to computation.

and that's a healthy inclusive broadness.

much as i would like to see a more intense engagement within the art and
poetry worlds with issues concerning the role of programming in art (not
simply programming as a technician's job), it's important to keep the juice
flowing from many areas through poetry, and the term 'code poetry' does that
quite nicely.

--

glad to hear you have something in the wordforword.info issue that includes
some 'code poetry', david--and i agree it's important "to broaden the areas
in which code is seen to be interrelated and operative" to "expand the
awareness and possibilites of art work or criticism". and you have done that
in this thread quite admirably! even though something may be, in principle,
open, sometimes force is required to add to the 'open'.

just got the 'oulipo compendium' in the mail today, the book edited by harry
mathews mentioned recently in the discussion of the random. very juicy to
me, and certainly about time i had a good look at it.

Backwoods Lowery


The Lowery organ was a fixture for decades; in Morgantown, there's a music
shop that specializes in them, but they're expensive. Nonetheless, I found
an old Lowery Mini-Genie, which looks like a Casio plastic keyboard (61
keys), but was apparently made by JVC for Lowery fans in the early-80s who
wanted something portable. Although early digital, it sounds like nothing
else and I recorded extended lounging which will surely find its way into
avatar videos. So here for your listening enjoyment,

http://www.alansondheim.org/lowery8.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/lowery10.mp3
http://www.alansondheim.org/lowery11.mp3

which are all based on one or another closely-watched rhythm or timbre,
somewhat similar, modulated for the most part in overly-strict time
signatures developed for easy early-80s listening.

Am currently putting together a list of poets, organizers, people
wishing to donate books. I have received lots of support from people
like Pen Creeley, Catherine Daly, Deborah Poe, David Baptiste-Chirot,
Paul Nelson, Tyrone Williams and others. Any "short cuts" and
advisories, talent, is appreciated. About making a difference, isn't it.
(?) As many of you know, My wife and I, with the assistance of others,
including many local artists (and all of India), we are organizing, as
people who have lived in many countries and traveled, who have and
currently
reside within a sometimes constraining state-controlled system, a center
and
outreach program that is designed to enable greater access, so ideas can
compete. And 2008 seems as good a time as ever. For the few years, we
have traveled and lived in the area of McLeod Ganj, India and elsewhere.
The center is slated to open in Feb 2008.

You can contact me with any questions or information. Please, NO money
(especially NOT dollars).

Yes, I remember his lovely George Oppen lecture for the SF State Poetry Center.He focused on Oppen's poem, "We have begun to say good-bye..."

 Ominous, in retrospect. Invevitably, ominous for us all!

got 'oulipo compendium' the other day. terrific book.

there's one passage though that is quite wrong. and i've heard perhaps
echoes of this passage elsewhere. not sure if this book is the source of the
error. somehow i doubt it.

the passage:

"One of Bourbaki's essential traits was its attempting to give axiomatic
theories a systematic, coherent and hierarchic organization; to build the
house of mathematics according to an architecture of "structures". This
trait brought it not only greatness but failure; for its choice of a
"foundation"--set theory--became obsolete at the very moment when the
undertaking was reaching its maturity. The Bourbakian concept proved
incapable of assimilating either the explosive new developments in logic or
the theory of categories." (p 42)

set theory is by no means obsolete. it is still foundational to mathematics
and is relied on heavily by contemporary mathematics/mathematicians.

Bourbaki was by no means the first to attempt an axiomatic development of
mathematics. If I understand Bourbaki aright, what distinguished their
attempt was their 'constructivism'. For instance, I'm under the impression
they did not accept existence proofs that proceeded by contradiction
(reductio ad absurdum); instead, they demanded that existence proofs
construct the entity (whose existence was to be proved).

another (related) characteristic was their attitude toward the potential
versus the actually infinite, which is an ongoing issue in the development
of mathematics. since the time of the greeks, we have known that unless one
is very careful, proofs that assume the existence of the actually infinite
can lead to contradictions. this is partly why the work of georg cantor was
so poorly received during his lifetime. some of his contemporaries, such as
the influential Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré were deeply resistant
to Cantor's ideas.

Henri Poincaré has been very influential on French mathematics. Bourbaki's
constructivism surely is related to  Poincaré's constructivist inclinations.

The problem with Bourbaki's constructivism is that it's difficult or
impossible to construct contemporary mathematics without assuming the
existence of the actually infinite and having recourse to things like
existence proofs by reductio ad absurdum.

I'm under the impression that Bourbaki flounders via these sorts of issues.
Not anything to do with the failure of set theory. Or perhaps it is the
failure of their limited, constructivist form of set theory.

I am by no means an expert on these issues, however, so I might be all wet.
But that's what I have got from my reading on these sorts of issues over the
years.

Publishing The Unpublishable
Edited by Kenneth Goldsmith
2008

http://www.ubu.com/ubu/unpub.html

What constitutes an unpublishable work? It could be many things: too long, too
experimental, too dull; too exciting; it could be a work of juvenilia or a style you've
long since discarded; it could be a work that falls far outside the range of what you're
best known for; it could be a guilty pleasure or it could simply be that the world judges
it to be awful, but you think it's quite good. We've all got a folder full of things that
would otherwise never see the light of day.

Invited authors were invited to ponder to that question. The works found here are their
responses, ranging from an 1018-page manuscript (unpublishable due to its length) to a
volume of romantic high school poems written by a now-respected innovative poet. You get
the idea.

The web is a perfect place to test the limits of unpublishability. With no printing,
design or distribution costs, we are free to explore that which would never have been
feasible, economically and aesthetically. While this exercise began as an exploration and
provocation, the resultant texts are unusually rich; what we once considered to be our
trash may, after all, turn out to be our greatest treasure.

The series will conclude when the 100th manuscript is published.

Please note that the series is by invitation only.

hi jim
an old family friend who is a mathematician (as my mom was, in set theory)
says wikipedia has a great article on Bourbaki. hope it solves something.

Probably someone misunderstands what Russell's Paradox actually did to Hilb=
erts program or got confused by a popular account of the incompleteness the=
orems and came away with the idea that mathematics is irrational. it happen=
s all the time.

Modern Axiomatic Set Theory is alive and well the last time i checked.

Also, while i'm not mathematics historian myself and i stop understanding f=
oundational issues somewhere around where the lambda calculus begins, and a=
ny way I gave up on the whole idea as unimportant after uncle ludwig wins h=
is battle with turing in the lectures on the foundations of mathematics, bu=
t your description of constructivism sounds more like what i understood Bro=
uwer's intuitionism to be, that is, only accepting positive proofs and reje=
cting ideas like proof by contradiction (and not just reductio) and consequ=
ently the law of the excluded middle as well as the the law of non-contradi=
ction. without recourse to wikipedia, are they the same thing, or might one=
 be constructivist without being an intuitionist. Or an intuitionist withou=
t being a constructivist, like Wittgenstein and Turing, although they disag=
reed on so much else. or is the one a subset of the other, and if so, which=
 one?=20
is a constructivist always an intuitionist or an intuitionist always a cons=
tructivist? or do they merely converge in a fruitful area of overlap.

i always wished i could see the romance of numbers beyond figures on paper =
and real things, and I think i maybe got close a couple of times with trig =
and mathematical logic. but in the end i just couldn't get it all to hang t=
ogether in my head.

I'm very sorry to hear of Burt Hatlen's passing.  I was really happy to
met him in Orono in 2004--I was very surprised & delighted to see a
Patrick Kavanagh commemorative mug for sale on a table there.  I didn't
know Burt but he seemed to be "in charge."  I approached & asked him
about the mug & he told me lots about Kavanagh visiting Orono, which
seems just as unlikely to me now as it did then.  It was a wonderful
connection though, & made me feel at home in Orono (kind of)!  Thank you
Burt!

it's fantastic that there's such a link between bourbaki and oulipo.

interesting that bourbaki proceeds, in a sense, via constraint, at various
levels. as does oulipo. the broadest sort of constraint is via axiom, formal
system. but, within that schema, there's another sort of constraint bourbaki
defined itself by, if i understand correctly, and that was the constraint of
its constructivism. it is constrained in not admitting certain types of
proofs in its enterprise of constructing all of mathematics axiomatically.
constructivism constrained itself to no assumption of the existence of the
actually infinite and also did not admit things like existence proofs that
proceeded by reductio. these are serious constraints that, i gather,
ultimately limited the ability of bourbaki to carry through on parts of its
mission.

yet surely that was important to do, especially if it ended up helping
settle the question of just exactly where such 'high abstraction' methods
are necessary.

Andy Campbell is one of the more interesting digital writers. He's giving a
lecture at De Montfort University, Leicester, on Jan 31.

He started creating digital fiction in the 90's for the Amiga computer (some
of that early work is also on his site). He's been at it quite a while. Is
now using Flash, mainly for the Net.

Help! I'm trying to locate a passage from Oppen's "daybooks" or "papers" where he quotes Blake's Jerusalem: "I must create a system, or be enslav'd by another man's."

Is this in the new Cope book or in one of DuPlessis', Anderson's, Young's, Davidson's, or Cope's selections in Sulfur, Conjunctions, Iowa Review, Ironwood, Germ or Jubilat respectively?
Thanks in advance, Eric

Amalgamated Writing Programs Announce
Morally Repugnant Poets-and-Theorists Exhibit

by Mike Freakman

New York, Dec. 22, 2007 – Darien Credenza, the Executive Muckamuck of
Amalgamated Writing Programs announced that a Morally Repugnant
Poets-and-Theorists Exhibit will be held at the organization’s annual
congress in New York. The exhibit is the first of what is planned as a
series of didactic displays at Amalgamated’s popular annual gatherings.

Credenza told AHP2 News that the exhibit would emphasize that
Amalgamated was a nonpartisan service organization. “Yes we have no
ideology. We only have craft. That is why we need not only to repudiate
literary theorists and cultural critics but also the poets who have been
brainwashed by them into spouting their Un-Amalgamated dogma.”

Dear EmailNation Subscriber,

The Society of Illustrators<http://lyra.thenation.com/t/16323/866263/420/0/>in
New York City is currently presenting a powerful show sponsored by
*The Nation*. Artists Against The War is the expression of over sixty
leading graphic artists and illustrators working in the United States and
abroad whose anguish has compelled them to produce works that challenge the
self-destructive ignorance, indifference, incompetence and corruption that
is the result of US Middle East foreign policy.

The works of art give a voice to those whose views are not represented by
the mainstream media. Check out the online version of the show
here<http://lyra.thenation.com/t/16323/866263/420/0/>.


A related panel discussion will take place *tonight, Wednesday, January 23*,
at the Society of Illustrators in Manhattan. And thanks to the Society, the
full proceedings will be available for viewing at the Society's
website<http://lyra.thenation.com/t/16323/866263/420/0/>.
So tune in tonight at 7:00pm--and see the action in person if you're in or
around the New York City area.

Media: The First Casualty in
Iraq<http://lyra.thenation.com/t/16323/866263/421/0/>
*The Nation* is sponsoring a panel discussion tonight, January 23, on the
nature of communications in wartime. How do words and images get stymied in
the run-up and roll-out of war? Panelists include *Steven Heller*, designer,
essayist and historian; *Christian Parenti*, author and *Nation* writer; *David
Wallis*, author and *Nation* illustrator *Steve Brodner* as moderator. The
panel is part of the Artists Against the War exhibition. At the Society of
Illustrators, 128 E. 63 St. $10 admission. Free of charge for students.

Finally, please visit The Nation
online<http://lyra.thenation.com/t/16323/866263/19/0/>to read new
*Nation* blogs, to view newsfeed links updated each day, to see when *Nation
* writers are appearing on TV and
radio<http://lyra.thenation.com/t/16323/866263/21/0/>,

reports and special weekly selections from *The Nation* magazine!

Dear list,

Burt was a mentor to me, though separated always by vast geography, but
he was also a very generous person.  His work on Oppen was seminal to
mine, and he graciously wrote a letter for me.  During the 1950s
conference in Orono, he gave up his seat at the VIP table so that my
wife could site next to her idol, Stephen King.  Quite the mensch, that
Burt.

He will be missed.

Following Monk Institute

The Following Monk Institute, scheduled for June 2008, at the Center for
Documentary Studies at Duke University, will investigate and celebrate the
North Carolina roots of Thelonious Monk's family and music. Highlights of
the institute will include guided tours of Monk's birthplace in Rocky Mount,
North Carolina, and the Newton Grove plantation where his ancestors were
slaves and where relatives still live today.

The Following Monk Institute is a rare opportunity to tour sites of Monk's
early life and heritage and the geography of eastern North Carolina. Led by
Sam Stephenson, director of the Jazz Loft Project at the Center for
Documentary Studies, participants will have the unique experience of hearing
from some of Monk's family members—Duke neurobiologist Erich Jarvis,
educator Pam Monk Kelley of New Haven, Connecticut, and Gaston Monk, an
educator from Pitt County, North Carolina—about their extensive research on
the family tree, and from Monk's son, T.S. Monk, about the relationship
between the family and Monk's music. Participants will also hear from
historians and musicians who will discuss the cultural and musical
significance of Monk's North Carolina heritage. Speakers will include Monk's
last saxophonist and family friend, Paul Jeffrey, and Georgetown
University's Maurice Jackson, who will explore the links between Monk's
music and spirituals and rural church music. Renowned pianist Henry Butler
will also present an exclusive concert based on the same topic. Guggenheim
Award-winning poet Betty Adcock will read a poem, commissioned for this
event as a tribute to the role of Monk's mother and the other female pillars
in his life.

The institute will include an exclusive presentation of sounds and images of
Monk's 1959 Town Hall rehearsals that took place in the New York loft of
Hall Overton and photographer W. Eugene Smith, whose obsessive photo and
audio documentation provides profound new glimpses of the complexities of
Monk and his music. This is a first-time preview of a major project at the
Center for Documentary Studies, involving the exploration and documentation
of rich untold stories of the after-hours New York jazz scene in the late
1950s to mid-1960s as seen through encounters in Smith's loft.

Jim--sorry about the incomplete address for the Japanese Ceil phone novels;
the correct one is included below--also some separate articles re aspects of
the digital & writing by my brother Paul Andre Harris and the Oulipo section
of his web site, with further links to other sites in French and
English--quite a wide and interesting variety including public works
projects done by oulipo members with tramway systems, etc etc--his own
essays on oulipo, ways of teaching oulipo, using it for teaching, papers by
students using it, etc--

he also has at his web site a section on the codes of the Watts Towers,
which he's been studying and involved with for some years now--inspired by
family friend the jazz musician Don Cherry--

also links with the journal SubStance which he co-edits and the
International Society for Study of Time of which he's the president--so
there may be lot of use there--

there is also this year the forthcoming Oulipo A Primer of Potential
Literature  an anthology of the leading oulipo writers edited by Warren F
Motte Jr.

re codes--i think there's a tendency towards a fetishization and
mystification of the aura of the digital and its codes--as though these
create a separate realm outside of the "old" ways and rules of the "dirty
old town" of the Pogues song--a virtuality of virtue, of purified, discrete
elements manipulated for the benefit and pleasure of an elite--an intriguing
branch of Formalism to be "explored" and "played with"--

Codes have consequences, however, in a very real world, and codes can also
be "fixed." The wonders of "random, chance programs can just as easily be
found in the roulette wheel which just so happens, "by chance, " to always
come out on the side of the house.   In the pizza place which was the news
hub for this sort of information in the mafia neighborhood I used to live in
in Somerville, MA, there was a saying--Mr. V-- " is going to have an
accident."

Sure enough, a day or so later, it's in the news--"Mr V HAS had  an
accident"  Crossing the street, hit by a bread truck he didn't see coming
out of nowhere from around the corner.  Well, people had been telling him
for a while he better make a new eye appointment, hadn't they.  Poor old
guy.  But that's life.  "Accidents WILL happen."

 Burroughs wrote of these sorts of things which one could create via cut ups
of images and sounds, the "accidents" which are inserted into the seemingly
innocuous daily round. Using a cheap old 8 mm camera, a crummy old tape
recorder--or nowadays a video cam--create your own "framing" "evidence" of
the "crimes" committed" by your "enemies"--those annoying neighbors--your
ex, the local congressperson whose views are getting you in dutch, set them
up, "catch them in the act", (created in the editing room), print it, lick
the envelope, stamp and address it,  and off it goes!

Besides the "fixing" of codes, mightn't one begin to investigate the forging
of them?  After all this is whathappened in the leadup to the invasion of
Iraq--the use of forged documents, of faked information, verified by
information found on the Internet--which itself had been a source of the
information fed as part of the top secret information in the first place.

Barry Schwabsky and I have been exchanging letters about art forgeries, and
it struck me that Benjamin's essay on "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction" might be thought of from a different point of view,
if one considers how awash with forgeries the art world actually is.  What
becomes of the "aura" of the original when it is actually a "forgery"--and
what then becomes of the "reproduction"?

Does the forgery subvert not only the "original" but the "reproduction"
also?

There is also the question of the "signature" and the "caption" attached to
the code.  For example--you see a poem and at the bottom it says it is by so
and so, a recognized and famous person and you think ah!! Wow!  That's
deep!  That's innovative!!  You see a name you don't know at all, and your
response is a bit muted, a bit unsure, even if you liked the poem, you might
think--well,hmm.   I better look that up and see what so and so says about
it.

 A photo in the paper of a person that looks like anyone--except the caption
reads, so and so is  charged with murder.  "My God! look at these terrifying
and ominous eyebrows!"  The same photo, this time captioned, "Avant-Garde
Poet."  "Ah!  What sensitive and radical energy shines in the eyes!"  Again,
the caption reads "Banker dead at 63."  "Fat capitalist swine!"

One of the aspects of codes you are discussing in relation with writing is
sets and constraints.  For Godel, sets are consistent but incomplete, just
as constraints are.  For myself, it is the areas of incompleteness and
inbetweenness that are of interest--the "hidden in plain site/sight/cite"
which is the code that goes unnoticed while the attention is drawn to the
"correct" codes.  By "reading between the lines" and "across the lines,"
"against the grain" as well as "with it,"  across the sets rather than being
restricted within them--one is essaying to "connect the dots" of the things
visible and invisible as it were, of the codes "meant to be seen" and those
not.  Lines begin in cracks, strati, faults, breakages in the earth and
continue into forms that become writing, codes--"lines of flight"--

Language is a symptom of a society's "code" of behaviours and beliefs.  It
is in the "obvious" aspects of codes that things speak a hidden language,
while in a more obviously coded language they obviously speak one begging to
be recognized as a code.

It is not only new ways of writing but new ways of reading that are
necessary, as without learning to be an ever more aware and alive reader,
one is ever dependent on "authorities" to tell one who and what to read. And
how to read what it is one is to read.  And that is precisely the problem
with the codes as they are being constructed ever more rigorously by the
authorities, for the authorities and for authoritarianism.

"Question authority" --seems to be reversed more often than not to
--"Authorities question"--
or --"how dare you question so and so's authority?"--

Is "Obey" then one of the first words written into the code?  "Without
question"?
"Thou shalt not kill"--"Collective punishment is a war crime"--one of the
interesting aspects of the study of codes is how they can used to justify
the employment of their exact opposites in the spheres of action.

Are codes themselves true, or only true depending upon who has employed
them?

"Mr V, who was to have had an accident today, was himself saved by an
accident.  The truck that was scheduled to hit him at the intersection of
Belmont and Somerville Ave at 3: 05, driven by A. di Salvo of 735 W
Evergreen, collided with a school bus  . . . "

MIME-Version: 1.0

A remarkable video and an interesting collaging of insights about what
art is.  Take a look at Ralph Lichtensteiger's blog Time 4 Time:
http://time4time.blogspot.com/2008/01/angel-one-for-jesse-glass.html

Blake saw angels in a tree. Lichtensteiger proves that the archetypal
form can ride accidents of chance to reveal itself in the 21st century;
but it's the intention behind the camera work--the framing that is
really remarkable here.

Jim,

When Foucault asserts that every word (or code) darkens, suppresses other
meanings around it, creating a negative space of charged silence, isn't he
asserting the reality of this space by applying the reductive method, by
contradiction, to language?

ted his adopted city in 2005. In 1989 he returned to his native Romania to c=

Coincidentally, I sent Burt Hatlen an email message yesterday to tell =
him how much I was loving reading a certain essay of his on George =
Oppen, and asking him if there were any plans to publish a collection of =
his essays.

=20

Burt was a gentle and generous man, and he was brilliant. I am one of a =
lot of people who were helped in so many ways by him, and who greatly =
admire, I dare say, his prodigious achievement as a scholar (and I =
greatly enjoyed his poetry too). His critical writing was unique and =
uniquely important. He deeply understood what he was writing about, and =
his language was precise always, his insights breathtaking, as was his =
breadth. I do hope a volume of his essays can see the light of day.

=20

I will miss corresponding with him. He would sign his communiqu=E9s to =
me, modestly, as "Burt (the Other)" How awful that he is gone, and so =
soon after Sylvester Pollet.

          The 1.5 million Palestinian inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are
facing a tremendous humanitarian and medical crisis. Israel's sharp
restrictions on fuel and electricity have severely damaged the provision of
safe drinking water, forcing people to make do with extremely poor quality
water which is dangerous to their health.

A group of Israeli organizations is planning a major action for Saturday,
January 26th, to bring a relief
convoy<http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&c=JJbgru3Hi1cPyC2ZkBOgAX3WznvEuLLm>of
desperately needed water filters to be distributed in Gaza by their
Palestinian partner there, The End the Siege Campaign.

Call on Congress to speak up! The United States must call for an immediate
end to the siege on Gaza, urging Israel to open its border crossings to
people and goods. Rep. Barbara Lee has called on Secretary of State
Condolezza Rice to request that the Administration "do all it can to secure
the delivery of these vital humanitarian goods and services to Gaza." (For

(I knew and loved David Askevold, and for years felt close to him. He was
a major influence on my life, the lives of his students and friends, al-
most everyone who knew him. His work was unique and in a very deep sense,
unfathomable and veering, nothing else is like it, it ventured into terri-
tories I didn't know existed. The doors he opened were unique. More than
anyone else, he exemplified the spirit of the Nova Scotia College of Art
and Design in Halifax, during the period it was considered the finest art
school in North America.

And David was the finest teacher of art I knew; he didn't teach so much as
opened space for his students to learn. His classes were sessions among
equals, intense, serious, playful, world. He had a soft voice and an
uncanny laugh. He was beautiful. He believed in the deep value of art and
lived that way. He was indescribable, and I'm at a loss for further words
here, these are poor enough.)

       DAVID ASKEVOLD
       1940 - 2008


        It is with deep personal regret that we inform you of
       the passing of the artist and educator David Askevold.

       David died peacefully, in a Halifax hospital, on
       Wednesday January 23, 2008.

       One of Canada's most influential artists and an important
       figure in many international art movements of the last 40
       years, Askevold's work as an arts educator has also had
       great importance on an international level. David was a
       long-time colleague and contributor to Art Metropole, and
       one of our first Artist Life Members. He will be greatly
       missed.

       The funeral will be family only. A memorial and
       exhibition will be organized for later in the year.

       Personal sympathies may be forwarded to David's wife and
       daughter:

       Norma Ready and Kyla Ready-Askevold

yes, you're right that what i was thinking of is Brouwer's approach. i'm
wrong. apologies. i'm spreading misinformation. just spent the last couple
of hours reading about bourbaki. for instance,
http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/logic/jrh0105.htm . nowhere are they
classified as constructivists in the sense i said they were.

i can't find any characterization of their philosophy concerning matters of
the potential versus the actually infinite. nor on matters concerning
existence proofs by reductio. which probably means they were OK with
assuming the existence of the actually infinite if needed and with existence
proofs by reductio, when needed.

i just think it's so cool, the strong relation between oulipo and bourbaki.
i know, many poets would be horrified at the thought of such an alignment of
mathematics and poetry.

but both can profit from the influence of each other. as apparently was the
case with bourbaki and oulipo.

math culture can be boring, rigid, narrow, trivial. without relation to or
participation in art, and with only a practical sense of beauty and
aspiration. without calling. without a sense of social responsibility and
vision. ultra 9-5. pocket calculators. white shirt. corporate dull. fussy.
regimented. task-masterish. neurotic. the energy of slaves. it needs the
strengths of art culture to give it a different sense of itself and the
world, and its place in the world. not simply as the brains and theorists
behind the engineering, but as artists toward a better world, toward a sense
of appreciation of the cosmos and the explanatory power of mathematics in
this world. mathematics as the poetry of science. in its intense engagement
with language. which, i gather, was a deep concern of bourbaki.

and poetry needs engagement with other fields also. particularly with
science. such a pathetic cultural gulf between the arts and sciences. poets
without a sense of the intensity of engagement with language present in
mathematics. poets afraid of mathematics. or angry at it or what it
represents to them.

and here is oulipo and bourbaki doing something profoundly different in that
regard. inspiring, really. truly.

(David Askevold would have liked this; in a way the translucency of the digital

I remember the two of us scuttling down a barren coastal cliff, jagged rocks
all the way, in the middle of a pitch-dark and stormy Nova Scotia winter night.
We were recording a foghorn and its echoes, holding on for dear life. I can see
the scanner images through an uncanny the memory of these soundings, which are

Will be Stateside in March and am currently in the midst of organizing
some readings, the most notable, perhaps, at Xavier University. Any open
slots and information related to locales btw Midwest and East Coast
would be appreciated. My work has appeared in journals both online and
in print, with new work to appear in upcoming Big Bridge, Otoliths (and
this is gonna be an IMPORTANT one for those interested in VISPO), and
Vibrant Gray. Is gonna be old-style, I guess, that hop into the back of
an old honda civic, thumbing it if need be, all in two weeks, and drive
from there to there, taking a pit-stop in Indiana to visit James Dean --
then back to China.

Yes, the context, the frame, is part of the code, isn't it.

Rather depressing, in a sense. Work never 'stands on its own'. It does and
doesn't, if it does at all. The frame, the context, is active in determining
what the piece means to anybody. Even if a work creates 'a world of its
own', the frame enters the world of the work as inevitably as water flowing
downhill. Meaning is always constructed not simply from what is read but we
must bring our world view into the construction, including our view of the
work itself. and the author. and so on.

we can find this depressing or respond to it as best we can and not attempt
to resist the inevitable but go with it. that the frame is so active in the
shaping of how people respond also means that there's a dynamic going on
that's a source of energy. it's interactive. it's interactive in ways we
have no control over. yet it is possible to open the work to allowing people
to make of it what they will in a more engaging way than if we assume the
poem can live in its own imagined world that people can decipher as we
intend them to do.

Yes. Most of the work I've done the last several years is explicitly
interactive. Inevitably in the above senses, but also in various other ways.
Sometimes there's a compositional interactivity; people are invited to
compose, in some sense. put the sound icons together. or create and
configure brushes or pens. or 'complete' the poem via writing. or type the
concept and the piece does something with the concept. and so on. sometimes
there's a game dimension. sometimes one is invited to play the piece like an
instrument of some sort, either sonic or visual or both.

if there is a 'whole' to this sort of work, then it is a combinatorium, a
space of possibilities. one is invited to imagine the whole space while
probably not ever experiencing the whole thing.

i think that part of what comes out of our experience of apparently new
forms of interactivity is a deeper understanding of how interactivity is not
new and a deeper understanding of how it is present in other
things/media/art/situations.

when i was writing my first dhtml (dynamic html) interactive pieces in the
90's, i was interested in the notion that texts could now have behavior. the
wreader does something and the text responds. i did a bit of resarch on what
had been written previously on text having behavior. i didn't find much, but
mcgann had written about the matter a bit in relation to language poetry.
which was cool, i thought.

but we know more now about the notion of text having behavior as a result of
the apparently new type of textual behaviors via programmed codes. texts do
not 'stand on their own' but have a 'life' independent of the writer
nonetheless, and a life dependent on the author and the
context/frame/environment they are received in. also, writers do anticipate
certain ranges of responses and sort of write combinatoria via anticipation
of multiple responses, at any juncture in the poem. ambiguity is a kind of
branching, an opening up to multiple possibilities and wreadings.

also, however new a form of interactivity is, it has to engage our old means
of making meaning. and expand those into new territory. sometimes the
adjustment is figuring out how it is doing the former before we can work it
into the latter.

The interesting thing is that in nearly every case the people who try to i=
ntuit or
infer a postmodern worldview from math and science get it wrong. They
conclude the world is irrational because of Cantor or morals are relative
because of Einstein or that we can't know anything because of Heisenberg.
They've heard a little, understood less, and they get it wrong. They go on=
 from
misunderstanding to error. That's the essence of why the postmodern
worldview is so messed up: it started with misunderstandings and went on t=
o
wrong conclusions from there. And then they, like the creationists, insist=
 that
any subsequent attempt at clarifying explanation is "only a theory", as if=
 a
theory is something excreted during a bout with the flu. They know what th=
ey
believe, and they are fundamentalist about it -- even while, ironically, r=
ejecting
"foundationalism". Nothing, in short, is true except what the postmodernis=
t
happens to believe -- but that is _really_ true: so true that no account o=
f where
he or she has misunderstood the basic ideas is possible.

Postmodern Bard

What asks the new postmodern bard
	Whose anti-reality ways
Have made her chopped-up prose so hard
	To praise?

She asks we say that all we know
	Is language and habit and fear:
That all is fake as her own faux
	Career.

She keeps her hatreds clear and bright,
Detecting the patriarch=B4s stench
On every guy who doesn=B4t write
	In French.

All principles are infra dig,
	Self-interest is all she infers -
Except your heart is not as big
	As hers.

No, not for her the outward sweep
	Of science=B4s infinite shore -
She feels her creed within her deep
	Heart=B4s core

She=B4s sure she=B4s sure, and sure her claim
	It=B4s not her intent to be right
Is right, as if there were no shame
	In sight.

Sincerely sure that nothing=B4s true,
	Unladen by theory or thought,
She knows it=B4s true she=B4s right, while you
	Are not.

Has anyone out there seen, read or just heard how Mei Mei Berssenbrugge's first 'pamphlet' of poetry "Fish Souls" ( Greenwood) was written. Or better yet does anyone own one who is willing to send me some or all of the poems pdf or copies??? Apparently it is really rare. I've been unable to find it anywhere for less than 285.00 and libraries in my area ( including inter-library options) just don't have it, including UB's special collections. Please back channel if anyone can help! Thanks !!

Cuneiform is pleased to announce the publication of:

THE CLOCK MAKER'S MEMOIR
by Dan Featherston=20

Advanced praise for The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir:

Through a series of poised, meditative stanzas, The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir
takes on the formidable topics of time and memory. What=B9s evident throughou=
t
this book is a careful craftsmanship leading to novel perspectives all
around the clock.=20
=8B Lisa Jarnot=20

The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir registers the world=B9s variety in small catalogs of
storms, shadows, dreams, memories, and rituals of childhood. In such forms,
time returns each time with a difference. Likewise, the supple measure of
these poems returns us to a rhythm or tone each time with a difference,
sounding a subtle echo of slipped in sleep. As William Blake declares,
=B3There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find / Nor can his Watch
Fiends find it.=B2 Yet Dan Featherston finds it =8B through alert and
resourceful art.=20
=8B Devin Johnston=20

With its precise music, The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir navigates the immeasurable
distance between the clock=B9s face and the face worn by lived experiences. I=
n
these poems, memoir is not some static repository: it is a poesis of the
present tense. Featherston=B9s craft and his unblinking commitment to
particulars fashion a lyric search that one can trust to ask the questions,
the necessary questions of time, space, and how we find one another amidst
all this memory.=20
=8BRichard Deming=20

Dan Featherston is the author of two booklength collections of poetry, Into
the Earth (Quarry Press) and United States (Factory School), as well as fiv=
e
shorter collections. He lives in Philadelphia with Rachel McCrystal and
their dog Fredo.

For those of you in New York City, Featherston will read from this book at

t
8pm. BYOB $5 recommended donation.

Dear Catherine Daly,

Below is information for you regarding two recent schedule changes.

SCHEDULE CHANGES

...

Due to a recently broken wrist, Louise Gl=FCck has cancelled her appearance=
 at
the conference. AWP wishes her a swift recovery to stay, as Stephen Colbert
would say, 'wrist-strong.'

Rae Armantrout will read with Mark Strand on Friday night at 8:30 in the
Grand Ballroom of the Hilton New York.  The reading is sponsored by the
Academy of American Poets.

Rae Armantrout is a native Californian whose poems are masterful
contradictions; according to Robert Creeley, her poems have 'a quiet and
enabling signature.' He adds, 'I don=B9t think there=B9s another poet writi=
ng
who is so consummate in authority and yet so generous to her readers and
company alike.' Her poems are telegenically 'regional,' filled with
bungalows, newscasters and swimming pools yet they ring with an immaterial
clarity that quietly subsumes her readers and listeners in a radical and
eerily funny vision. She was at the center of the first generation of
Language Poets, the group in the US most often credited with introducing
poetry to postmodernity. Since then Rae Armantrout has forged a growing
international reputation--publishing eight remarkable books of poems, most
recently Up to Speed (Wesleyan, 2004) and Veil: New and Selected Poems
(Wesleyan, 2001), as well as countless poems anthologized (Best American
Poetry 2002, and Postmodern American Poetry, a Norton Anthology, 1994) and
gathered in diverse journals such as Conjunctions, Partisan Review, and the
LA Times. In 2000, A Wild Salience, a collection of critical writings on th=
e
work of Rae Armantrout, was published (Burning Deck). She has directed the
New Writing Series at University of California, San Diego, (UCSD) since
1989, and co-organized the Page Mother=B9s Conference in 1999. She has taug=
ht
writing at UCSD for almost two decades.


--=20
All best,
Catherine Daly

Interesting comments Marcus, but I again renew my challenge to you to prese=
nt me with examples of five postmodern thinkers who actually believe that n=
othing is true but what they believe.

In the past I've given you plenty of examples of non-postmodernists who rej=
ect some of the positions that you hold to be essential for a "correct" wor=
ld view. Taking just the example in this email of foundationalism. One of t=
he leading critics of foundationalism whose work is still held to be fundam=
ental to the coherence theory of epistemological justification is Laurence =
Bonjour at the University of Washington. I can say with 100% certainty from=
 my personal acquaintance with the man that you're never going to find a LE=
SS postmodern worldview. Politically, he's aligned more or less with Nozick=
 as opposed to Rawls at the other end of the spectrum, and metaphilosophica=
lly he's dedicated to the traditional analytic method that descends from th=
e modern era in philosophy. He's the only professional philosopher I've eve=
r met who thinks that Quine is unimpressive due to a lack of rigour, and wh=
en=20
someone brings up someone like Heidegger or Foucault, he tends to say "cont=
inental philosophy?" and shrug his shoulders because he doesn't consider hi=
s unfamiliarity with them to be any sort of impediment to his work.

That having been said, he's probably more aware than anyone of the problems=
 with foundationalism and although he has at this point recanted his earlie=
r coherentism and his thought currently runs towards a modified version of =
foundationalism, he's intellectually honest enough to admit that as a theor=
y of knowledge it has real problems that no one has overcome as of yet.

I'm offering you this description of my former professor as an example of t=
he kind of intellectual honesty you're going to have to display in order fo=
r anyone to take your "postmodern theorist" bogeyman seriously. Show me whe=
re you are finding these people who are absolute relativists and believe in=
 nothing but the subjectivity of the self. Find me Five well known and resp=
ected thinkers in the field you're criticizing who hold the beliefs you're =
attributing to the group of "postmodernists" as a whole.

Because if you can't do that, then you're just making straw men of opposing=
 viewpoints and as a result I have developed the suspicion that you're an o=
bjectivist since that sort of sophistry was an important part of ayn rand's=
 "philosophy."

If that's the case then there's no point in having a conversation with you =
about this and your position is just as anti-rational as the position you h=
ave repeatedly attributed to "postmodernists." The first requirement of int=
ellectual honesty is to admit to oneself the possibility of one's position =
being wrong. If you can't do that, then I wish you'd stop riding this parti=
cular hobby-horse, because it could be an interesting discussion but only i=
f freed from argument by appeal to dogma.

Thanks,
Jason

The darkness surrounds us here at The Poetry Project but we will not
succumb.

Here are next week=B9s readings:


Monday, January 28, 8 PM
Jee Leong Koh & Ada Lim=F3n


Born in Singapore, Jee Leong Koh read English at Oxford University and
completed his Creative Writing MFA at Sarah Lawrence College. His poems hav=
e
appeared in Singaporean anthologies, and in American and British journals
such as Crab Orchard Review, Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, The Ledge
Magazine, and Mimesis. His poem =B3Brother=B2 has been selected by Natasha
Trethewey for the Best New Poets Anthology 2007, to be published by the
University of Virginia Press. He published his chapbook Payday Loans in
April 2007. Of the chapbook, Marie Howe says, =B3Smart, irreverent, often
unnerving, these sonnets smirk, smile, argue and bless.=B2 In 2006 the
Singaporean government banned the reading of one of these sonnets, because
=B3it promotes the homosexual lifestyle.=B2 The ban makes Jee Leong Koh out to
be more dangerous than he really is. Ada Lim=F3n, a graduate of the Creative
Writing Program at NYU, has received fellowships from the Provincetown Fine
Arts Work Center and NYFA. She is the author of two books of poetry, lucky
wreck and This Big Fake World.

Once again, start with Rorty. I think I can find five postmodern thinkers =
who
say, or at least imply, that nothing is true but what they believe, even t=
hough I
agree with you that not a single one of them routinely acts on that belief=
 in
their day to day lives. To my mind, it is that chasm between what they're
willing to say and how they actually lead their lives that makes me think =
they're
more interested in building a coterie of cross-supporting social, politica=
l,
financial, and professional people who will refer to, defer to, hire, and =
promote
one another, than in worrying about truth, beauty, justice, or proportion.=
 I urge
them to have the courage of their convictions. If they're going to SAY tha=
t
nothing is true but what they believe, then I want to see them believe
themselves to, say, health. Or even better, into bad health and then into =
good
health again. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

I don't know what a "correct" world view would be. I'm pretty sure, though=
, that
people who say there's nothing out there, but still get regular medical
checkups and pay their health insurance premiums are frauds. Why aren't
such people successfully living on love and pale moonlight if there's real=
ly
nothing out there?

Wow -- 100% certainty but no foundationalism, eh? Fundamental to the
coherence theory, but no foundationalism, eh? Words are tricky things, and=
 so
is grammar. It's hard to be a real postmodernist, particularly if one has =
the
view that there are people who are good, smart people who are working hard=

to try to get ideas and language to coincide, to get things right, insofar=
 as any
human being can get things right. You seem to be making my points for me,
here. A fellow who is working hard to get something right is not a
postmodernist? Well, duh.

Well, I remain over on the Rawls side, but still, so what -- this fellow s=
ounds as
if he's someone I could easily admire. Again, though, what is your point? =
He's
anti-foundationalist and non-postmodern -- but so what? So was Socrates.

Oh, so he's not an anti-foundationalist, per se, after all -- and yet he's=
 also not
a post-modernist. Hmm. But it seems to me that the traits you're describin=
g in
this man are not the traits of postmodernists, and yet your use of him in =
this
context prompts me to think that you think of him as a postmodernist who
demonstrates none of the traits or beliefs of the postmodernists. He sound=
s
like an admirable guy. So do you. From what I've read of your writing here=
 and
there online, and from what you say about Bonjour, it doesn't seem to me a=
s if
either of you are people who hold the views I'm criticizing.

Sorry, my opinion of Rand, and the sociopaths who tend to believe her nove=
ls
are philosophy, is even lower than my opinion of postmodernists.

Perhaps, if you're willing to engage in the endeavor, we could try, first,=
 to
define what we can agree to mean when we say "postmodern"?

Marcus --

Just to get a word in edgewise:  Jason asked you to name five postmodernists
who claim that nothing is true but what they believe.  You named Rorty.  So you
still have four to go.

just about all of my work is available for free on the net. also, no one
pays me to do this work. i don't spend a lot on the equipment. anything you
need to view the work, such as the shockwave and flash plugins, is free.
some of the work is available in portuguese, french, spanish, italian,
finnish, and chinese. the work does not require a high-end computer to run
properly on. my own machine is four years old. which is fine because i have
to know if the work will run on average machines ok. the download times
range from dial-up speeds to broadband, depending on the work. most of the
work is ok for dialup.

i had a job for a while working as a programmer for an academic
musician/digital artist. he had a $500,000 grant from a gov agency seeking
to encourage dev for super highspeed networks. the developed work was seen
by a remarkably small audience in performances. and much of the new media
scene art is for performance or gallery. remarkably small audiences,
remarkably expensive work.

but i am very net oriented. partly because i'm a writer and the main
paradigm is publish. not perform or show. but beyond that, i like the net
because it is not justly described as for an elite, these days, david. yes
it costs some money. but not an arm and a leg. i know people on welfare here
in canada who have an internet connection and a decent computer.

the paperback used to be cheap and there was an explosion of literacy. books
aren't so cheap anymore. the internet, as a whole, is.

"elite"? i don't think so.

some characteristics of organic and emanent life


homeostasis - boundary maintenance + (coherency of avatar body)
elaboration: coherency references a body that remains topologically
  connected, no matter what external and internal motions occur.
consideration: of course the body may be split by wounding, division,
  and other processes; in these cases, the body homeostatically
  repositions itself. external motions: the organism or emanent changing
  position in relation to the external world (space time coordinates);
  internal motion: processes, motions, within the body of the organism.


immunity - identity maintenance + (database accountancy)
elaboration: immunological processes based on body identification
  (organism) and database stability and stable addressing of whole and
  parts (emanent).
consideration: relationship of dis/ease and disease/hacking. identity
  maintenance occurs within absolute fluidity; with organism, motility
  and bodily changes (disease/death/exhaustion/dissolution/decay/
  extinction/mutation etc.), and with emanent, 'remakes' (new textures,
  bodies, accouterments, etc.), corporate transformations (economy,
  merger, dissolution, etc.), and interest/disinterest/defuge in
  relation to maintenance.


culture - remembrance and communality + (history of interactivity)
elaboration: organism - culture occurring 'all the way down,' with
  internal/external memories/storage/data-processing/quantum and
  molecular, etc. memory and communality inhere. emanent - relation-
  ship of external (organic) or internal (digital) mind to avatar
  _steerage_ (which is intentional).
consideration: mind inhabits organism inhabits mind; inherence is
  primordial, backgrounding. there is a complex relationship between
  this inhabitation and issues of health, disease, death, etc. - issues
  that simultaneously reify and parcel the body, and a turn towards
  moments or places/spaces of body (pain for example) that call for
  tending. there are qualitatively different tendings for organism and
  emanent; it is a matter of time before they coalesce.


negation - circumscription of an other + (avatar interactions,
  game physics)
elaboration: circumscription sends the other to the pale; structures
  gesture and language, transforms ikonic into indexical.
consideration: semantics of avatar boundaries on a subtextual level;
  semantics of organic boundaries on the supra-textual. the latter is
  ikonic, the former, indexical. (perhaps there is no place for the
  symbolic in the midst of emanents and organisms.)


consumption and excretion tropisms (energy flow)
elaboration: evanescent organic life as abject spew, continuous
  breathing. a stationary emanent requires no energy; a stationary
  organism continues its tropic behavior.
consideration: nature of the tropism, energy-seeking, pollution-
  fleeing. direction of emanent irrelevant; energy comes from external
  steerage.


variegated metabolic processes (chemical, quantum, atomic)
elaboration: striations and differentiations within organism.
  epistemologically, organism transforms internally and externally
  from horizon to horizon; emanent possesses epistemological
  equivalence (substance) and differentiation occurs in syntactics.
consideration: herbert simon's nearly decomposable hierarchies;
  differentiation in organism occurs on the level of the phoneme.
  emanent and organism meet on the plane of semantics, sememe.

-- absorption and excretion
elaboration: or circulation, necessary for organism, and only for
  emanent in the sense that mind requires circulation (as do
  computers in terms of cycles, energy-flow, etc.).
consideration: note in all of these instances we're considering life
  in terms of the _metabolic,_ flux-processes, remembering, identity,
  recognitions, tropisms, negations, perceptions.

-- reproduction
elaboration: organisms most often self-reproduce through one or
  multiple generations; emanents do not. organic emanent minds do
  but not electronic emanent minds, do not.
consideration: reproduction is not necessarily a constituent of
  life - dreams of the loch ness monster point in another direction.
  and there is always the exhaustion, punctum, of the 'last of a
  species' or reproductive pool, which is becoming more and more
  common. say that reproduction temporally smears the organic while
  identity spatially restricts the organic.

----- carrier image (reproductive plan, layout) + (template)
elaboration: reproduction is haunted by the organism to be, whether
  template or internal processes.
consideration: with organism, reproduction is always already uncanny;
  with emanent, reproduction is canny. with organism, internal and
  with emanent external, steered. the emanent is always already
  hallucinatory, which is not to say inexact or 'unreal'; its model
  and modeling are elsewhere. let us say that the emanent is freed
  from reproduction but an emanent class is bound to steering mind for
  continued existence.


maintenance of interiority
elaboration: what goes on inside, stays inside, is maintained inside.
  for organism this includes temperature control (or adjustments to
  non-control); for emanents, this again is a matter of contiguity at
  best.
consideration: wounds close, bruises heal, diseases disperse; there
  is an ideal at the back of organism, backgrounding organism, as if
  primordial (and when i use 'primordial' here, i mean nothing meta-
  physical, only primitives, backgroundings, against or within which
  everything else occurs). nothing immediately with emanents, but a long
  time ago, in irc (internet relay chat), netsplit would occur, and
  members of coherent communities would be cut off from each other -
  there would for example be two, not one *love channels. it would be
  of interest to think through the metabolism and political economy
  of irc channels and channel communities as organisms.


biome and niche maintenance (immediate vicinity cleanup)
elaboration: what happens outside the body of the organism, more or
  less in the immediate vicinity (think of potential exceptions such
  as albatross or plankton, bring them into the model by including
  mobile niches, evanescent biomes). emanents also tend to control
  their immediate vicinity; sl avatars will have a 'home' teleport
  site, will fly to a certain height, will be admitted or not to
  restricted territories (and may create restricted territories of
  their own).
consideration: mobile niches within evanescent biomes are of great
  interest; they reflect the potential of taz (temporary autonomous
  zones) and extend the concepts of home and territory - the latter
  might be considered a personal niche, and the former, that biome
  which provides a necessary degree of comfort for its species and
  occupants. different species may connote different biome
  definitions which overlap and are displaced from 'human geography'
  and its defining characteristics.


contiguity of body or bodies + (substructure of sheave-skin)
elaboration: organic body held together by skeletal (internal and
  external) structures, skin and muscle, etc.; the sheave-skin held
  together by parent-child relationships and restrictions on size
  and angle. contiguity is complex with sheave-skins; importing a
  bvh file into blender requires hand-setting the parent-child
  relationships, and motion capture models permit extensions and
  topological remodelings of these. generally organic bodies are
  topographically defined; there are physical restraints to size, etc.
  while emanent bodies are topological, once 'set' into structure by
  node assignments. again, the latter reference external steerage.
consideration: this external steerage of emanents is mapped in
  various ways - through mind and gui or other interfaces, through
  virtual reality interaction software, through software itself which
  may operate emanents autonomously, so that the emanent becomes
  nothing more than an output display of a program epistemologically
  other. of course this may change in the future; there is no reason
  why emanents should not be autonomous and locally-so, so that
  steerage, communication, etc., is part and parcel of the emanent
  software, integral to it, inhering.


regulated, homeostatic communication
elaboration: organisms and emanents are nodes, channels, transmitters,
  receptors, codes, encodings, decodings, part-objects and their per-
  ception, skins and sheave-skins and their perception. to the extent
  that regulation occurs, cohering semantics emerges; to the extent
  that noise or parasitism enters the systems, transformations and
  possible mutations occur, beneficial or destructive, possibly inher-
  ited or not (and the latter, with emanent mind-steering, becomes to
  some extent an issue of conscious choice).
consideration: one begins to approach a _plasma model_ within which
  forms flux, and flux forms, stases are imminent and always in the
  process of forming and dissolving; memory is primordial (in the
  above sense).

-- internal and external + (between mind and emanent)
elaboration: internal processes are homeostatically regulated in
  organism; it is moot whether such occur in emanents except to the
  extent that _emanents are inherently part of the gamespace, do not
  ontologically exist other than as gamespace._
consideration: external communication - one might bring issues of
  data-bases with both organism and emanent, steerage, community and
  individual memory, community and individual hallucination, etc. it's
  here that language comes forth as the mutual orienting of cognitive
  domains (maturana); while one might speak of the cosmos as languaging
  and only languaging (epistemologically and ontologically), one might
  also conceive of languaging as ikonic in terms of the primordial,
  the thinging of language, or language grounded (as in electronic
  grounding) in things. in this sense, language is literally an after-
  thought, shape-riding.

-- emitters and receptors (within and without organisms)
elaboration: sm (sado-masochist/abject) maws/fits/misfits,
  the contradictory transformed into the contrary or wayward.
consideration: emitters and receptors are in-line, online, bought
  into line vis-a-vis codings. without emitter and receptor interfaces,
  languaging doesn't happen; one might think then of emitters and
  receptors _themselves_ as ikonic languages, so that sign-flows are
  fundamental (but not symbols or indices).

---- emitter and receptor codings (entranceways and exits)
elaboration: entrances and exits but also molecular or protocol
  structures, sm touch/scent/contact. information must obey etiquette,
  otherwise it's noise. etiquette touches on the aesthetics and
  efficiency of coding. _coded emanents have no code_; their code is
  external steerage, subtextual beneath the surface, in the dis/splay
  of sheave-skin.
consideration: it's important to think through analog/ikonic and
  digital/indexical here. organism code is ikonic to the extent that,
  for example, dna coding _is_ molecular, while emanent code is
  indexical since to some extent programming languages are interchange-
  able, they're teleologically drawn-out to steerage goals, and they
  form/construct a performative layer which runs the emanent directly.

---- domain orientations (tropic turns towards energy, communication
  potentials)
elaboration: organisms are tropic, turning towards, away, or skew-
  orthogonally; emanents are tropic through camera positioning (without
  the camera, emanents are invisible, non-existent, which are not equiv-
  alent) within the aegis of mind.
consideration: cameras move emanents as residue, dejecta, abject stain
  on occasion blocking the field of view.


pollutions and abjections (body disposal, chemical slough)

-- purifications and expulsions
elaboration: this operates on the epistemological if not ontological
  dichotomy described re: kristeva, douglas, etc. organisms are channels
  and flows; the flows channel, and the channels flow. the abject is
  integral to organism, just as purification and expulsion may be
  integral to emanent.
consideration: this may be far too simplistic, but it's a step at
  least. when the true world is considered, emanent and organism are
  interpenetrated, intermingled, formed and in/formed together at the
  limit.


emanents and avatars inhere, cohere, mishmash, spew, emit, slur, slough,
intermingle, interpenetrate, within the true world, they are true-world-
ing, in a sense mind-only, but only in the sense that steerage is always
present, from language through metabolic process through retinal process-
ing, immunological defense systems, heartbeat, hormonal maintenance, soft-
ware updating and replacement, membrane filtering, and so forth. this is
_not_ life force, but inherited and inhering organization in relation to
reproduction, within which the carrier image is but a dream, our dream,
our presentification of the future anterior.

(elements marked + pertain in particular to emanent/avatar process. note
that in the above, 'emanent' and 'avatar' are to some extent equivalent,
although the latter is mostly reserved for entities within second life
and other online/offline 'virtual' worlds.)

enjoyed the collages very much, camille. especially "enjoy the sights and
sounds of nature" at http://www.camillemartin.ca/index.php?pr=Collages_2 .
was this a post-katrina piece?

ja

ps: the two graphic links on

Of course it's "elite" -- half the world's population, some three billion people,
have never even made a phone call, much less logged on to the internet.

Quite apart from that, though, art is itself necessarily an "elite" occupation --
even if it's merely an avocation. You have to have the education, the time, and
the energy to pursue art after you've achieved your subsistence needs. The
pyramid flattens out dramatically at the top: the number of people who can
afford the time and energy to pursue art after having invested in an education
that gave them an appreciation of other peoples' art, and the inclination to
pursue their own, is very very small -- it's an elite. The numbers are
inescapable.

Marcus,

First, you're talking about several things at once, each more "dire" than
the former. To wit,

This, taken on its own, doesn't seem to make much sense. It's intellectual
rigor that we're talking about, and believing in nothing but what one says
would seem to discourage any type of "coterie" or community.
Next,

 This is mere supposition, and I doubt that you have examples of well-known
theorists who behave like this. If so, now would be a good time to give us
names.

And lastly,

So, even if I don't 'believe' in my field of research --primarily because
I'm *unsure* of my research as being "true" ( do you mean, universal?) -- I
should still declare my allegiance far and wide? To declare a theory as my
own belief would be intellectually lazy and arrogant at best, not to mentio=
n
prime time for someone to come along and disprove me.

So, let me get this straight: early man and woman, marking on cave walls,
were elitist?

I cannot agree that half of the population, having access, could ever be
truly called elitist. The only thing "necessarily" elite about art --as in,
nothing one *needs* to do could be considered "elite," inasmuch as food and
shelter aren't "elite" wants-- is that not everyone can pull it off. But
hell, not everyone can pull off quiche.

Dear friends,

We are very very very very very excited about these upcoming events at 456
Bergen Street.  The first upcoming, upcoming THIS WEEKEND, SUNDAY AT 5 PM,
is very exciting: The St. Petersburg Review, an excellent new journal which
publishes contemporary Russian literature in translation, has flown in a
genuine Russian poet from Russia, one Aleksander Skidan, whose book is being
published this week (tr. Genya Turovskaya) by our favorite neighbors Ugly
Duckling Presse, and we have arranged for Unnameable Books to be the
Brooklyn stop on his American tour.  He will be accompanied by Matvei
Yankelevich, an Ugly Duckling editor, whose recent book of translations of
the great Russian absurdist Daniil Kharms, TODAY I WROTE NOTHING, may be the
only book in the history of the world which both made the Unnameable Books
TOP 10 BOOKS OF THE YEAR List AND received a fawning, thoughtful essay by
George Saunders in the New York Times Book Review.

The next event at Unnameable, coming NEXT WEEKEND, Saturday at 3 pm, is
organized by the Ohio-based Essay Press, whose representatives are in town
for the big AWP shindig over in Manhattan.  They are bringing together three
(count 'em, three!) terrific poets you've probably heard of, if you pay
attention to such things: CARLA HARRYMAN, KRISTIN PREVALLET and JENNY
BOULLY.  Essay Press has recently reprinted Boully's THE BODY: AN ESSAY,
whose first edition, from Slope Editions a few years back, became an instant
classic and went quickly out of print.  They also published Prevallet's
latest book: I, AFTERLIFE: AN ESSAY IN MOURNING TIME, which was one of my
favorite books of 2007 and could easily have made my Top 10 List if I hadn't
been so intent on including so many dead white males.  I gather that they
are soon to publish a book of Carla Harryman's, entitled ADORNO'S NOISE,
which seems a likely contender to make my best-of-2008 list.

Scroll to the bottom of this email for some relevant poems, blurbs and
links.

***
Advance Praise for Aleksander Skidan's forthcoming book, RED SHIFTING:

"To read a book this fierce, this honest, to disappear into these beautiful,
wrecked
songs-and to disappear 'more fully' precisely because they question 'the
idea of the
wrecked song'-is a singular, moving experience. The poems in Red Shifting,
translated beautifully by Genya Turovskaya, display a near-physical,
wounding
intelligence, an intelligence unflinchingly aware of what it means to think
history's
recklessness." -- CHRISTIAN HAWKEY

"Anyone interested in the vital pulse of contemporary Russian poetry will be
richly
rewarded by this expertly translated selection of Aleksandr Skidan's work.
It is
visionary and transgressive, erotic and Corybantic, ancient and immediate,
and 'it
strikes suddenly/like a crooked needle in the heart.'" -- MICHAEL PALMER

***

And here, the first paragraph of a six-paragraph poem by Carla Harryman
(from her City Lights book THERE NEVER WAS A ROSE WITHOUT A THORN):

FISH SPEECH
In the beginning, there was nothing. No cattails, no wigs, no paws. There
was no doom. No lavendar or shirt sleeves. No burn no yellow or rest.
Neither was there beginning. No light went out. No one held her own against
an army of misshapen events. There were no chains. There was no writing or
speech. There was nothing to shave, nothing to swim, and nothing to cut.
Clouds were not clouds. Silence was neither dominant nor peaceful but
silent. There was no salt or smell. No twisted seaweed. Or any buoyant
flowering possibility of an ambiguous growth. There were no killers and
fleeting lives. There were neither chains of events nor metaphor. There were
no stories or bones. No mulch or cocoons. No lizard, pelicans, or fish.

Thanks for reading,
Adam

I can agree with you that Rorty's version of pragmatism ultimately leads to nihilism, although that's because I think Rorty is mistaken about his concept of truth as intersubjective agreement. However, I don't think it's fair to him to say that he believes that nothing is out there. Rorty stated on a number of occasions that he admires and more or less agrees with Arthur Fine's philosophy of science, which has at it's heart a desire to do away with both anti-realism and realism and instead to accept what Fine calls our Natural Ontological Attitude that stuff exists as it appears to exist. Fine believes that the hardcore metaphysical arguments of scientific realism amount to a stamp of the foot and the insistence about scientific facts "NO REALLY!" I'm grossly oversimplifying another former professor of mine here, but perhaps more to the point is an essay in Rorty's collection Objectivity,
Relativism, and Truth (the name of the particular essay escapes me now) where he makes the distinction between "lumps" and "objects." In Rorty's view, lumps are the things that definitely exist and happen and behave independent of our perception of them, and we make objects of them "by our own lights" intersubjectively agreeing about how to speak about them. Which is to say, I don't think he ever believed that there was nothing but what he thought was the case, but rather that Nagel's "View from Nowhere" version of objectivity had real problems. I don't think Rorty ever got his epistemology as well worked out on this subject as did Fine, and I think that he was led into error as a result, but again, I'm not sure it's fair to say he believed there was nothing but his subjective perspective of the world. Rather, his subjective perspective of the world was all he had to go on, and argument with
people who disagree with him on important points had to be done "by his own lights." Or to put it another way, Rorty didn't believe that nothing was true but what he believed, but rather believed that truth and falsity is a statement about a fact that is ultimately based on intersubjective agreement. Again, I think this particular view leads to nihilism at least, if not relativism, but Rorty vehemently denied that it did and spent a lot of time arguing against his critics that that was an inevitable result of his thinking.

I'd absolutely agree with you. THe world is what it is. but i'm really not sure that anybody doesn't think that.

Epistemological theory as currently understood by the analytic tradition in philosophy: the five minute version.

One knows something when one has a belief that is true and that one is justified in believing to be true. Foundationalism in epistemology being the view that justification comes from inference from foundational belief, and coherence theory being that justification comes from the way a belief hangs together in a coherent picture of the world.

I disagree with both and with the idea of knowledge as justified true belief because they're theories expounded upon by treating everyday common words as jargon and because they're attempts to answer a question (How do we know that we know something?) that given a correct understanding isn't a sensible question.

that you know somehting is shown through the way you live. to take over your example, that I know I'm a person living in the world with a body is shown by my moving around, that I go to the doctor, that I eat when I'm hungry, etc.

What's interesting here I think is that this is a view that was held by the very non-postmodern Ludwig Wittgenstein (which is how I came to it) and also by the father of all the postmodern thinkers Martin Heidegger.

My point is that you characterized postmodernism as an opposition to foundationalism. I was just pointing out that opposition to foundationalism doesn't equal postmodernism. If you accept that they aren't coextensive, then there's no problem.

Oh good. That's a real relief. I always worry when I have conversations like this that I've gotten myself involved in a conversation with a crypto-objectivist.

I think that may be a good place to start. Particularly given that there is a postmodern "poetics" that is ultimately something relevant to the list.

To my mind, postmodernism is a general set of trends in the world of intellectuals that begin roughly at the close of the second world war and last until about the turn of the last century. it's characterized primarily by those who can be described as "postmodern" taking seriously the phenomenological methods of Martin Heidegger and the semiotics of Ferdinand Saussure. In combination you get a rejection of a couple of ideas that originated during the protestant reformation and enlightenment that play rather largely in western thought prior to about the mid twentieth century. Those are first and foremost the idea that there is a progress to history in the sense that it occurs in recognizable epochs that are engaged in dialectic with eachother. The second is that the sign and the signified have to bear some formal, intrinsic relationship to one another. I think the rejection of both of these
ideas has particularly far reaching consequences, and the folks who spent the last sixty or so years exploring those consequences and their work are what I mean when I use the word "postmodern."

I have a suspicion that Marcus's response to this would be that that's exactly what someone should do and risk disproof.

that having been said i know of all sorts of theories that are also my own beliefes (the theory of evolution, the theory of relativity, the theory of contractualist ethics, the law of the excluded middle, the copernican theory that the sun is in the center of the solar system (although the theory of relativity does allow that to say something is at the physical center of a system is a choice of reference frame and therefore fairly inconsequential as it turns out), and there are others...).

I'm guessing, and this may be a bit of a non-sequitur, but of the groups that made cave paintings, the guys who did the paintings on the walls probably weren't the low men on the totem pole in the various tribes that neolithic cultures were organized in. The only group I can think of who were engaged in creative pursuits that were not an elite were the craftsmen of the various feudal governments which allocated power by heredity and where tradesmen were more or less on a par with the peasant farmers as far as social standing goes.

*The Writers in Prison Committee of International PEN is shocked by the
death sentence handed down to journalist Sayed Parwez Kambakhsh on 22
January 2008 for blasphemy. International PEN calls upon President Hamid
Karzai to personally intervene in this case as a matter of urgency, and
calls for the immediate and unconditional release of journalist Sayed Parwez
Kambakhsh in accordance with Article 19 of the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights. *

* *

According to PEN's information, twenty-three year-old Sayed Parwez
Kambakhsh, journalism student at Balkh university and reporter for the local
daily *Jahan-e-Naw* (*The New World*), was arrested on 27 October 2007 in
Mazar-i-Sharif, Balkh province, northern Afghanistan for distributing
allegedly anti-Islamic literature. He was detained by National Directorate
of Security (NDS) forces on blasphemy charges after downloading and giving
to friends an article that allegedly said the Prophet Mohammed ignored
women's rights. He was not the author of the article. He was also reportedly
accused of possessing allegedly anti-Islamic books and starting un-Islamic
debates in his classes. Whilst Kambakhsh admits to circulating the article,
he denies the accusations of blasphemy.



Sayed Parwez Kambakhsh was tried by an Islamic court in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, Balkh Province, on 22 January 2008, and sentenced to death.
The trial was reportedly held behind closed doors, and he had no legal
representation. Sayed Parwez Kambakhsh is feared to be targeted for
association with his brother, prominent journalist Sayed Yaqub Ibrahimi, who
works for the Institute of War and Peace Reporting and has been under
escalating pressure for his critical reporting on local officials and
warlords. **

I am writing to express my shock regarding the death sentence passed down to

I understand that on January 22, 2008, Mr. Kambakhsh, a journalism student
at Balkh University and reporter for the local daily *Jahan-e-Naw* (*The New
World*), was tried by an Islamic court in the northern city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, Balkh Province, convicted of blasphemy, and sentenced to
death. The trial was reportedly held behind closed doors, and he had no
legal representation.



I am seriously concerned about the circumstances surrounding the charges and
sentencing of Mr. Kambakhsh. I therefore urge you to intervene to secure his
immediate and unconditional release in accordance with Afghan law and
Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.



Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Yep, the ones who had the time and energy left over from subsistence were
elites. You don't imagine that cave paintings were done by every man-jack,
woman, and child in neolithic times, do you? Of course not -- the paintings
were done by an elite.

Most people spend most of their time on satisfying their needs and wants in
pretty conventional ways. They don't make art for any number of reasons, but
mostly because they have neither the inclination nor the time. The people who
make art in any society are a small elite, compared to the size of the
population. Even if you count every student enrolled in creative writing in this
country as "artists", you're going to have a very small percentage of 300
million. Add up everyone you want to call "an artist" in the country and you're
not going to come to 150 million people, your "half the population" nonsense!

Artists are a small, elite minority. They have the time, education, and energy to
pursue an endeavor that is not what they do for their principal means of
subsistence. And where it is their principal means of subsistence, only a tiny
fraction of artists makes enough of a living from it so that it is their vocation as
well as their avocation -- not counting the teachers, of course, who, after all,
are being paid to teach, not pursue their own art, by educational institutions.

But even if you count all the art teachers, all the artists, and all the students, in
the US, for example, a rich country where there are MORE teachers, artists,
and art students than in poorer countries, even counting all of them together,
they are still an elite minority out of the whole population of the US.

That artists are a small elite in any population seems a non-controversial
claim, and it's astonishing to hear anyone dispute it. It takes determination,
inclination, education, time, and energy taken away from earning a living to be
an artist. People who can afford the education, time, and energy taken away
from earning a living are always a small elite within a larger population.
They're part of a marginally larger small elite in rich countries than in poor
countries, of course, but no matter how you slice it, they're an elite.

I've recently read a John Yardley essay (old)  in the Washington Post (also old) concerning the amount of space the Modern American Library has given to Roth. I like Roth. He's a major American noveliest, but he ain't no Faulkner. Not that close. & MAL has given him more pages, space, etc,  than  W  F.  That's not right.  What if something called  the  Modern Russian  Library  gave  Joan  Didion (her Russian equivalent) more space than Tolstoy?  & I also like Didion. But she's no Tolstoy. We need perspective: important minor writers, or even major writers such as Roth are not the same as a unique world kick ass influences such as Faulkner.

Dear Marcus,

Please retrieve your straw man. You'll find it burning with bright dancing
flames on pp. 333ff. in Rorty's _Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature_.
When the smoke clears, you may find the text of interest.

To wit, Derrida & Rorty, outside of the caricatures of neo-con
lickspittles like Roger Kimball and the half-assed musings of drunken grad
parties, do not deny the existence of truth. Period. End of story.

Not in the least -- the coterie is social, financial, professional. What they say in
the "intellectual" way is just fashionable nonsense, calculated to obfuscate and
obscure, so that no one has to work too hard at anything resembling
intellectual rigor. It's a coterie to promote and hire one another, to publish and
admire one another, not one intent on doing any actual work. The coterie must
only agree that they like one another and will help one another -- they don't
have to agree on any actual intellectual program beyond jargonizing their
fashionable nonsense together.

I'm asserting that this is what nearly all the chattering classes do just this, not

Sturgeon's Law applies to philosophy, too: 90% of everything is crap. I don't
have to "give names". We are all, I suppose, the same about our philosophers
and poets as we are about our Congressmen: everyone's a crook except
ours.

Of course a becoming modesty about one's research is a good thing. By the
time one is doing real resarch, however, one imagines that the researcher has
had to make some choices about field and dream, and has some idea what
he or she does in fact believe about how the world works or doesn't work. One
may hold one's beliefs contingent on better data or evidence, of course, but
one must have _some_ beliefs, true or not, in order to do any research at all, it
seems to me.

And of course, making a claim and having it disproved, if it has not a matter of
having had such beliefs routinely disproved before, is a good thing in and of
itself. The goal is, of course, to get it right, but if you get it wrong in an
interesting way, that can be as significant and important as getting it right. So
being "disproved" is not, prima facie, a bad thing.

I can't see how a postmodernist would go about proving or disproving
anything, though. On what grounds would a postmodernist say anything is
better or worse than anything else?

As for your "artists are not an elite" claim, I just looked up the figures from the
US Census from 2000 online (http://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/c2kbr-
25.pdf), and it turns out that self-identified artists, designers,  sports, and
media people, all in one lump in the census, are 2.5 million people out of 280
million people -- not even 1%, even giving you sports and media people as
"artists".. Add in all the Architecture, draftsmen, cartographers, engineers,
surveyors, etc, which are also all lumped together in one group, and you have
about 4.4 million more. Add them to the Artists category and you get about 7
million out of 280 million, or about 2. 5% Of course, that requires that you
agree that surveyors and engineers, for example, are "artists", which I'd say is
a debatable proposition at best.  But even granting that everyone who has
even a remote claim to be an artist in the US _is_ an artist, including
architects, engineers, surveyors, draftsmen -- hell, add in a million of the 7.5
million teachers as an estimate of the arts teachers of all kinds, and call it 8
million artists out of 280 million people, and round upwards and say it's the
magnificent total of 3% -- all in all, I'd say that 3% is a small elite -- what would
you say?

Feudal governments, during what era? Feudal implies a larger society of
castes, marked by religious and monetary (or landed) elites, using this
status to govern others. Feudal doesn't apply to group hierarchies of
hunters having more clout than gatherers, etc. Now, if you mean rank in a
hierarchical group (hunter, gatherer), I might suggest that there might have
been, in some larger groups, an individual nominated or agreed upon as being
the "artist," the most capable of rendering images of group activities and
triumphs/defeats.

But hunters and gatherers in an elite?

I would agree that the idea of elite art stems from a moment when art no
longer represented the result, or depiction of, "the hunt" (i.e., as
representative of group efforts, situations, fate and futures). Once the
communal aspect of art leaves that environment, the potential for elite art
becomes possible. But not until that point, because depiction doesn't detach
from experience until the artists seeks to -- a la Red Badge of Courage --
depict an event she/he doesn't witness. But I think we're past that. Now, is
there really any point in pointing out what art is elitist and what's not?

this ungainly one.

over a half hour at top speed, I wanted to see what happens with extended
improvisation bound to permanent rhythm. with a rhythm of steel ferrules.
hot notes beckoning. what happened that I saw was severe carpal tunnel in
my right wrist and elbow. it was close to impossible for me to play this
fast for any length of time. so i thought; now my hand and arm shake with
jabs of pain. you can hear this occasioned at
http://www.alansondheim.org/hotsmall.mp3 .

the other Lowery have been removed to make room for this ungainly one.

The example was meant -- misunderstood due to the unfortunate omission of
the word "all" before "theory" -- to be somewhat meta: it seems somewhat
self-defeating, especially in one's own field or area of interest, to adhere
to the theories of others as personal gospel.

Exercise for Beginning



Today I got on the stationary
Bike that you sit down on. I thought riding
Recumbent would be easier on the joints
Boy does that require some extra
Work. I mean, it's nothing like real cycling
The fresh air, the sights and sounds
The whizzing cars,
But when I turn the fan on high
And I'm watching candidates appear
In front of an audience just like me
=96They seem smaller when I go faster =97
I wonder how we'll vote
It's nothing like being on the road
But somehow, my reward is in the cold squirt bottle.

I think it's safer to say Rorty denies the object-existence of truth,
which I think amounted to an outright denial of truth's 'truthiness'
for many people. Here's how Rorty put it in 1989's Contingency, irony
and solidarity.:

" We need to make a distinction between the claim that the world is
out there and the claim that truth is out there. To say that the
world is out there, that it is not our creation, is to say, with
common sense, that most in things in space and time are the effects
of causes which do not include human mental states. To say that truth
is not out there is to say that where there are no sentences there is
no truth, that sentences are elements of human language, and that
human languages are human creations."

Rorty regards this, I think rightly, as a statement which should not
be controversial, which is not to trivialize the debate, just to
point out how nice and cogent his position is. To find a 20th cent.
phil who argues with the first statement, about worlds being 'out
there', you've got to go to Nelson Goodman or Cassirer. To find a
20th cent. phil who thinks 'truth is whatever you believe', you've
got to go to Dondald Davidson- except he recanted that position
completely (and it was probably an over-simplification to begin
with). Part of the book quoted above is dedicated to a funny debate
where Rorty tries to convince Davidson to maintain his old position,
while Davidson maintains he has to abandon it. Can I say again how
much I liked Rorty- what a shame I never crashed one of his lectures
at Stanford while he was still alive.

arts.  The Handbook is ready to go public ? thanks to the sterling
work of its editors Aymeric Mansoux and Marloes De Valk of GOTO10. In
the collaborative spirit of the handbook, we would really love your
help in promoting it.

"In the next week, it would be great if you could blog it, link to
it, sell it (only figuratively speaking of course!), and promote it
far and wide. Tell your friends, your colleagues, and the people you
come into contact with that there's a new book for digital artists
that could potentially change their life, or at least their practice.
As part of a collaborative effort to promote the handbook, we?d love
you to link to us from your website and we?ve even created a handy
little button that you can use. Just visit http://
www.digitalartistshandbook.org/?q=node/32 to view the code and the
Digital Artists Handbook button. We hope your website or blog will
wear the badge with pride, and of course in return we?d be delighted
to host a reciprocal link to your site or blog on the Digital Artists
Handbook site. Because the handbook hasn?t been launched so far
we?re not top of the search ratings for ?digital artists
handbook? yet, so anything you can do to link to and promote the
site would be highly appreciated. Do write to our Communications
Coordinator Matt Wootton at matt.wootton@folly.co.uk and let us know
what page of your own site you would like us to reciprocally link to."

Hello listafarians,
I'm asking this question for a friend who is an art historian. She
inquires:

> I'm looking for American writers (pre-1960) who were also visual
> artists.  I can think of lots of artists who were writers, but I'm
> looking for folks who were primarily novelists, poets, etc. who also
> made visual art on occasion.

I'm afraid I wasn't much help, so I offered to pass her question
along to this list. If you can help, drop her a note at
katy.floyd@gmail.com.

Barry,

You don't need to be part of the elite to be elitist.


Well, that's somewhat convenient to the discussion. Sure...I'll bite. But
why not?

If you're not using your elitism as an elite would, and you're certainly not
using your elitism to show to others less elite than you that you're
elitist, are you elite? Not likely, because you fail to use your elitism on
grounds that both define the term and differentiate those "accused" of it.

I also think that Johns might have it closer than Bourdieu, that the artist
is closer to proletarian than worker.

On a more personal level, I think what bothers me most about calling artists
elitists is boorish and cliche. Other than that, I think sometimes the term
is warranted, sometimes not, like most labels.

Hi - We're looking for someone, responsible, to sublet our small loft in
Brooklyn for $700/month, from mid-March to the middle or end of August.
The price includes water, heat, and gas; you'd have to pay electricity and
Net (both of which are inexpensive). We're leaving our books, plants, and
some equipment in the loft, but there's plenty of room. We're looking for
non-smokers. The loft will hold two people (one bed), one extremely
comfortably. We're located near BAM, the Atlantic-Pacific subway stop,
Long Island Railroad, Atlantic Center, and both Flatbush and Atlantic
Avenues. Please write to Alan Sondheim, sondheim@panix.com, or call
718-813-3285 if you're interested. (Please pass this on, and thanks!)

- Alan Sondheim and Azure Carter

Off the top of my head, I can think of:

Henry Miller
William S. Burroughs
James Purdy
Jack Kerouac
Elizabeth Bishop
e.e cummings
Sylvia Plath
Kenward Elmslie
Joe Brainard (a writer who painted? or a painter who wrote?...hmmm...)

Many more I'm sure.  Hope this helps.

Best,
Brian Cassidy

I was thinking of the feudal period in China prior to the reforms in
the late shou that led to promotion by merit instead of by heredity.
Of the similar period in Japan leading up to the Edo period, and of
the similar period Europe from the fall of the roman empire to
roughly the beginning of the reformation. During those particular
feudalisms we don't know the names of most of the artists because
nobody thought they were important enough to keep a record of. They
were of the same social status as coopers, cobblers, smiths, masons,
and weavers. Even more interesting is the fact that performing
artists, the professionals at least, were largely on the same strata
as thieves, beggars, and prostitutes in the same period in europe,
although I don't think the same is true of feudal china and feudal
japan.

I think there are some serious problems with Rorty's conception of
truth as intersubjective agreement. Take for example this thought
experiment: Imagine a post apocalyptic world where gunpowder and
bullets are no longer produced and haven't been seen in a half dozen
generations. In this world, everyone knows how guns used to work and
understands the principle, but the also know that there are no more
bullets and so no gun will fire. A loaded gun is sitting on a table.
It contains the last unfired bullet ever manufactured. Now by rorty's
conception of truth, the fact that anyone in this culture would agree
that this gun isn't loaded, we'd have to say that the proposition
"this is an unloaded gun" is true for them. It's only untrue for us
because I've given us the God's Eye View in the thought experiment.
So in the end, what we have is the truth that you can fire a bullet
from an unloaded gun. Which is nonsensical.

Better to go with a disquotational view of truth whereby the truth of
propositions is just that they say what is the case and accept that
we don't always know what is the case. What is the case is not
something that is determined by my own lights, but how I put it into
words is, and that's a critical distinction that rortian neo-
pragmatism doesn't make. It annoys me though, because Rorty tends to
apply his misunderstanding of Wittgenstein as a justification at this
point, talking about Language-games as though they were real parts
oflanguage and not a form of model.

Didn't Rorty speak of a "community of values?" He struck me as a good, secular progressive.

i remember you moved from new orleans to toronto during katrina. so this
startling picture of nature, i wondered if it was a post-katrina piece for
you.

it's great to see you are doing your own web site. it has a good feel to it.
like it is home made and explorative. and could still be around in several
years because it is undertaken seriously. best wishes with it, camille.

hoping your move to toronto has been good,
ja

He was a good secular progressive, but he didn't manage to veer away
from a stance of cultural relativism in ethics and politics as well
as he thought he had. Given his view of the nature of values, he
believed that the best (his) values would win out in a free market of
ideas where everyone comes to the table and advocates for their own
beliefs by their own lights. The problem is that everyone coming to
the table and advocating for their own beliefs by their own lights is
itself a value and and if you try to justify it you get a vicious
regression. He tried very hard to get out of this trap and I think he
thought he was successful, but he never got there for me. I much
prefer the more rationalistic and stolid traditional social contract
type progressives like Rawls and Scanlon. One of my biggest problems
with Rorty is that if you take his neo-pragmatic view on epistemology
as workable and accurate, the arguments of Rawls and Scanlon--who in
my opinion are the most persuasive exponents of progressive values in
20th Century american philosophy--don't amount to much. It's a big
problem for a system to undermine those it agrees with when it's goal
is to let everyone have a seat at the table.

I think you have a problem here if and only if the party in question
continues to believe the gun is unloaded after it goes off. Most
pragmatisms, I think Rorty's included, allow for adjustment of belief
based on circumstance. Rorty's only radical in the sense that he
thinks adjustment of language is equally significant. Otherwise, all
these people are committed to is a material conditional: "If there
are no bullets, then no gun will fire". Again, he's not an irrealist
about the world, nor is he an idealist about thought. A genuine
problem may be the world in which we DON'T remember what guns or
bullets are, a loaded gun appears on a table, and everyone agrees its
harmless, even after someone died from it going off (they attribute
the death to a heart attack or witchcraft or something). That might
seem, to those of us who understand guns, to be very problematic. The
neo-pragmatist response here would probably have to rely on some
robust notion of evolution and casual reasoning, hoping the whole
thing would get sorted out in a generation or so.

I really can't say whether Rorty misunderstands Wittgenstein. Which
Wittgenstein are we talking about? Do you have a text in mind?
Certainly Rorty takes up the investigations over the tractatus, so
all talk of 'what is the case' is less important to Rorty, just as it
seems less important to the late Wittgenstein, no.

(fun discussion though)

And Walcott was talking about this this morning as I was listening
(still more or less asleep) to a BBC program ("The Word" I think it is
called, a weekly lit discussion) that also had on someone who just
published a book of paintings & drawings by writers (including
Faulkner and Conrad among others).

Some of Poe's art work--primarily sketches--are extant, and they show a
skilled hand.

Seems like quite a hatchet piece on Pound by the reviewer. I wonder
if the book is also out to make Pound seem like an idiot. Definitely
does not make me want to read the book. Also seems like the reviewer
is more interested in getting across the fact that he thinks Eliot
the greatest thing since sliced bread.

Yes, I'm sorry,  I withdraw Walcott.  But what about all you dudes sending =

I think the problem is essential to any conception of truth that
talks about it as being intersubjective agreement. The point being
that, specifics of the thought experiment aside, it is conceivable
that there is a world where people would intersubjectively agree that
something is true in fact, when it isn't in fact true. There's a
problem here that Rorty can't get around because his recasting of
what it means for something to be true loses a critical and crucial
way in which we use the word true and as such, is philosophers nonsense.

which is to say that he misunderstands the late and the early
wittgenstein, who weren't as different as most folks would have
people believe, and to that end, I highly recommend Ray Monk's "How
to Read Wittgenstein" which is the only ntroduction to Uncle L I've
read that gets it close to what I think is right.

Rorty goes awry all over the place with Wittgenstein, and the ways in
which he goes awry are particularly strange I think for someone who
appreciates Heidegger. That is, he fails to understand the importance
of the "form of life" to Wittgenstein's conception of the dissolving
of philosophical problems and instead cherry picks the idea of a
language game, recasts it as a sort of peircean building block of
language, and leaves out the more crucial elements of Wittgenstein's
program, which is to get philosophers to stop talking so much garbage
about the world. Which is to say that I think the late Wittgenstein
is still as concerned with the early wittgenstein's program of
outlining what the world is, but he's much more cautious about it.

Which is strange I think, taking Heidegger into account, there's a
certain sense where Dasein and wittgensteins "Our Form of LIfe" have
a great deal of overlap and agreement. But that's an aside.

My beef with Rortgenstein is that he's still the analytic philosopher
trying to work out what language is rather than the continental
mystic who knows what language is and is trying to show the fly the
way out of the fly bottle. I think that the latter is a much better
picture of Wittgenstein, both early and late, than is a more
traditional "Ordinary Language" reading.

If we're now worldwide let us not forget August Strindberg, and oh yes, with
regard to Stephen Vincent's reference to Michaux, he also wrote several
books including 'Miserable Miracle' (a must read for substance surfers!)and
a book of his poetry 'Spaced, Displaced' is published by Bloodaxe Books.

              Purgatory Pie Press; feature at Back Fence February 10; next CLWN
              WR event at SAFE-T-GALLERY on March 20; Alex Caldiero in town in

Hi folks - this is just to let you know that i'm a last minute addition to this Wednesday's "Friends of Tuesday Shorts" reading at the Boxcar Lounge at 168 Avenue B (between e. 10th and e. 11th streets in the east village)  - for those of you who don't know Tuesday Shorts you can find them at www.myspace.com/tuesdayshorts
they're an interesting little blogzine that only publishes stories of 100 words or less - they have a weekly reading period between noon saturday and noon sunday and if you're accepted you'll appear in the following week's issue - they won't answer personally but you'll know in a couple of days if your work was accepted (it will either be up on the site or it won't be) - i'll be reading with Mike Young, Donald Capone and Shelly Rae Rich - the reading starts at 8 PM and should be a lot of fun

* * *

yesterday i was at the Purgatory Pie Press studio in lower manhattan signing copies of my first totally new cutout in over a quarter of a century - it's issued as part of their 2007 PurgaSquare2 [that 2 should be a superscript] Card Series (a subscription series of art and poetry postcards handprinted (letterpress) by Dikko Faust) - each card is 5-1/2 inches square and is limited to an edition of 144 copies (each is signed and numbered by Dikko and also signed by the respective poet/artist) - mine is a fairy tale with a twist (which is why it became a cutout that folds through the third dimension) - for those of you who don't know my cutouts they are "participatory cut-out multiples on paper" in the tradition of inexpensive artists' books - they have been shown in a small two-man show (with Alex Caldiero) at the Brooklyn Museum - in a retrospective at the BACA's Downtown Cultural Center - and in group shows in Toronto, Los Angeles and Brooklyn - as well as being included in a
 text book on writing poetry, in an anthology of performance scenarios and in the upcoming PLAY BOOK to be published by Proteus Gowanus - the new cutout (which is titled "Once Upon") is available for $9 from Purgatory Pie Press (postage included - they can be reached through their website: www.purgatorypiepress.com ) and in another week should be available at Proteus Gowanus in Brooklyn where two of my other cutouts are currently on display as part of their 2007/2008 interdisciplinary themed "Play" show (for more details see: www.proteusgowanus.com )

* * *

and for those of you who are interested i'll be featuring at Robert Dunn's Asbestos series at the Back Fence on Sunday, February 10 at 3 PM - this well known Village venue is located at 155 Bleecker St. at the corner of Thompson and can be reached by the A, C, E, B, D, F and V to West 4th St. - admission is $5 plus a $3 minimum at the bar - there's also an an open mic.

* * *

plus mark your calendar.  The next big CLWN WR event is scheduled for March 20 at the SAFE-T-GALLERY in DUMBO.  Pencilled in so far are feature Liza Wolsky and special guests R. Nemo Hill, Sheila Lanham, Richard Loranger, Jane Ormerod, Moira T. Smith, Joanne Pagano Weber and Francine Witte, with another feature and a couple of more guests still to be added.

* * *

and for those of you who were enthralled by Utah poet Alex Caldiero's October 2006 performances at CLWN WR events at ABC No Rio and SAFE-T-GALLERY and his feature at the Nightingale Lounge in the east village, he'll be back again in early May to perform at the Mad Hatter's Review extravaganza benefit on May 4 at the Bowery Poetry Club and will once again feature at Nightingale on Monday May 5, as well as at the Brownstone Poets series in Brooklyn on saturday May 3 - more details will follow - if you've never heard him you're in for a treat

Looks as if the list includes folks who were around pre-1960 but may still
be around

were these mentioned

bukowski
Ginsberg (photography)
Diane DiPrima I hear has been in some art shows
Ted Kooser paints well

If you're want some names of living writers doing art, you might want to
get a list of contributors to the show "Crossing Boundaries: Visual Art by
Writers" co-sponsored by The Poetry Center at Passaic Co. community
College and the Paterson Museum in Apr/May 2006

Jason,

Is Wittgenstein really trying to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle
or just that the bottle does not exist?

In the statement, "what the world is," is there not the assumption that the
world must be embodied in predicates (the world *is*), which to me is not
necessarily (clearly) so.

Ciao,

Murat

 DIGITAL ARTIFACT MAGAZINE  **Call for submissions**

ISSUE 2: TRANSNATIONALISM

Deadline: May 15, 2008

Digital Artifact Magazine interrogates narrative in contemporary culture
through fiction, criticism, experimental prose, and web-based audio-visual
work. We're specifically interested in the impact of digital culture and
globalization on contemporary narrative(s). How do these phenomena create
new forms of story, text, language, and literature? What kinds of narratives
have emerged from specific elements such as web sites, chatrooms, video
games, Myspace, internet porn, digital photography, web cams, blogs,
internet media and cell phones, as well as broad trends such as the
breakdown of national boundaries, the increased speed of communication, and
the globalization of culture, capitalism, and war?

The second issue of Digital Artifact will examine the idea of
transnationalism. What is the transnational space in literature and art? How
do we describe the textual and digital interactions between countries,
classes, cultures, languages, and identities? How do we write/track border
crossings, migrations, translations, trans-cultural identities and
conversations? In particular, we are interested in narratives that cross
boundaries between the countries of the so-called first, second, and third
worlds, narratives of migration, war, global society, cosmopolitanism and
refugee culture. What does nationalism mean in our time? What is your
(trans)nationality? We invite creative responses that explore these question
through fiction, criticism, experimental prose, or web-based audio-visual
work. Our aesthetic tendencies are always on display at
digitalartifactmagazine.com.

Submission Guidelines

Lil' Norton is pleased to announce the publication of its first ever book,
"Comment is Free: Participatory Politics for a New Age," an essay on
democracy compiled by Lawrence Giffin, with an afterword, "F the Prez," a
diatribe compiled by Steven Zultanski. The book is available from
print-on-demand service, lulu.com. It is sold at cost ($6.41), no profit
will be made. THIS IS NOT A COMMODITY. Desperate times call for desperate
measures, so we have foregone the frills. The essay presents a generous
sampling not of expertise but of American democratic fervor and home-grown
competitive spirit. In a democracy, there is no wrong answer! With the
democratization of knowledge and dissemination provided by the internet,
Steven Zultanski's afterword combines all the nomadic anti-authoritarian
zeal of anonymous bloggers and rhizomatic messageboard scriptors. The proof
of the pudding is in the taste-test. Order your copy today.

But that's just what makes it so appealing! I think it was Ben Franklin who
said: "... another beautiful theory beaten to death by a gang of brutal facts."
The people who base their notion of how the world works on intersubjective
truth as truth are people who really want the brutal facts to leave their beautiful
theories alone. Implicit in any merely coherence theory of truth, such as
intersubjective truth is, is the possibility that people will agree that something
is true when in fact it isn't true. The human consequences of holding
intersubjective truth to be truth is, in my view, the never-ending temptation to
ghettoize the facts, and pretend that the theory is all one needs. All kinds of
groups, from social cliques through advertisers and political ideologies to
world religions,  attempt to insist on intersubjective truth to sell and bolster the
well-beings of their members and leaders. There is, of course, a continuum of
means of insistence and amounts of compulsion -- please don't deliberately
misunderstand and accuse me of suggesting that junior high school social
cliques are actually murderous cults, or that murderous cults are really merely
junior high school social cliques.

Intersubjectivity of truth, or what I've been calling "postmodernism", seems to
me to be nothing more than that old time religion, fundamentalism by another
name, an insistence that if we just clap our hands loud enough, Tinkerbell will
live.

Further, though, the notion that people would preach intersubjectivity of truth
and then pay their medical insurance premiums and go to the hospital when
they feel sick seems to me to be hypocritical. Have, I urge the intersubjectivity-
of-truth folks, the courage of your convictions: get together and talk that
cancer away! Frankly, I can't see how Richard Rorty even died -- and perhaps
he didn't. Surely if he and the intersubjectivity-of-truth folks talk loud enough
.... Maybe pretty soon someone will roll the stone away and the tomb will be
empty, eh?

For me, it seems clear that those kinds of views flow directly out of the notion
of intersubjectivity of truth, or postmodernism, as I call it, and the problem is
that it's not the case that if everyone really believes that the Messiah will come
on June 23rd at 3 o'clock in the afternoon at the top of Salisbury Hill, that he'll
come. Really believing in something is not enough. But Rorty, and much of the
rest of the contemporary world, seems determined to try to make it so by
saying so.

It is the "flow directly out of", the consequences, of holding an intersubjectivity-
is-truth view of truth that seems to me to be so objectionable. It's quite a ways
down the road to double-think and to that brave new dystopia so clearly seen
at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries as being at the end
of the intersubjectivity-as-truth slope.

We needn't postulate post-apocalyptic societies and last bullets to test
intersubjectivity-as-truth. Not one philosopher, however rarefied his or her
views, experiments with intersubjectivity as truth by persuading the riders in
the car that the philosopher has had the steering apparatus modified so it's
more helm than steering wheel, and that by turning it left one goes right, but
without having done the actual mechanical work, and then jerks the wheel left
into oncoming traffic to see whether confident belief will trump mechanical
facts. So, for philosophers, isn't all this "intersubjectivity-as-truth" stuff not
much more than playing parlor games during office hours -- if it's not
deliberate hypocrisy?

Whatever happened to the idea that philosophy is supposed to get us from
disguised nonsense to obvious nonsense?

Doesn't truth have to have a certain coherence AND a certain connection to a
real world out there? There are any number of millions of examples of
misunderstandings arising from clear facts because of the differing contexts in
which various observers got those facts. It used to be that the point of
intellectually honest inquiry was to fight against the all-too-human tendency to
believe that the strongman was right because he was the strongman, or the
priest because he was the priest.

Now, it appears, that the wielders of the tools of intellectual inquiry are
throwing in with the king and the priest, in light of the fact that the necks of the
former seem to be somewhat more resistant to being strangled by the
intestines of the latter than hoped. It just seems to me very much as if the
postmodern notion that everything is pretty much the same as everything else,
one belief as good as another, so long as we all agree, is an abject surrender
to the kings and the priests. What more could a king or priest hope for than
that the intellectuals say "Yeah, whatever -- it's all good. We'll believe in
whatever you say we ought to believe in because what difference does it
make what we believe in so long as we all believe in it."?

I think I'll throw in the towel defending Rorty out here after this.
But the notion that those who think truth is a property of sentences
and not worlds are more susceptible to being hoodwinked or becoming
themsleves hoodwinkers is bogus. I'll find you plenty of
correspondence theory proponents, the good-old-fashioned "truth is
the way the world is folks", who have horrific political beliefs and
an apparatus of "objective fact" to support them. Wasn't Boaz being
'objective' when he drew up his first phrenology charts? Do you think
we have any pomos in the White House, or the Baptist convention?
You're likely to find correspondence theorists all the way down the
line. In fact, just about every correspondence theorist worth his
salt, until the 20th century, cashed in his theory by claiming true
thoughts are those that correspond with the way the world is IN GOD'S
HEAD- and most of them needed that little bit to make a satisfactory
theory (Descartes being the guiltiest of all). You can tie up and
burn someone with any cross you like, and get the timbers from any
forest, which I take it you also agree with.

Personally, however, I would be much more scared of the prophet who
subscribes to a correspondence theory of truth, because he might also
believe in his infallibility. You won't find Rorty anywhere asserting
his infallibility- always quite the opposite. He doesn't anywhere
deny the existence of an objective world, so I don't think he would
have any trouble countenancing the cancer that killed him. His only
suggestion is that, whenever the way we talk about the world stops
being useful for the purpose of doing whatever the hell it is we want
to do, nefarious or benign, we will, and historically have, switch
our way of talking. Occasionally, those shifts are so great that
statements in our old way of talking that seemed solidly true would
register now as either false or non-sensical. You know, wrath of
Greek gods, flat earth, all the usual stuff we pomos talk about. My
challenge to any and every correspondence theorist is: what do you do
about our track record of forming true beliefs, as evaluated in
hindsight from our current set? Do you really think the history of
human ideas is one of coming closer and closer to the actual facts,
and that the current generation holds more true beliefs than the
last? If not, and we are only as good as every other historical
society has been, than we really haven't got any idea how the world
is put together at all, based on all the 'facts', or seemingly
verified beliefs and opinions, we've had to toss out to get to where
we are. I for one don't think we know a thing more about how the
world works than, say, Lao Tzu (who believed in dragons and humors
and a whole happy host of deities running the show) did, we just have
different ways of talking.

I think your worry, and perhaps Jason's also, contains it's own
defeater. if there are real world consequences that obtain regardless
of our beliefs, that are as important and 'dangerous' as you're
holding them to be, then isn't it inevitable that we feel them? In
that case, who cares what your epistemology is. A coherence theorist
and a correspondence theorist are in exactly the same shoes when the
hammer drops- both will have to adjust their beliefs or perish. Why
should we believe that either epistemic position lends itself to
individual false beliefs more or less than the other? I'm yet to see
an argument to that effect in this discussion.

Neither epistemology is going to tell you what the true and false
statements are, only what it is for a statement to be true. You want
to say 'a statement is true when it corresponds to the facts (and do
stop me here if I'm getting you wrong)', Rorty wants to say, and I
like his position on this that 'a statement is true when it plays a
helpful role in a discussion we're having at a given moment in a
particular language'.

I guess it depends on how you read old uncle L. I take the metaphor to be saying that misunderstanding and philosophers nonsense were the bottle, and I think he definitely thought those existed. To be sure, I he didn't believe that there were such things as philosophical problems. At the same time, he very much understood the reasons that people act as though there are and wanted to save himself from the traps of language as much as anyone else.

embodied in predicates is an interesting way of putting it. i don't think that's how Wittgenstein would put it. I am currently working on a sort of manifesto that begins with the statement that "the World is everything that is and is not anything that it isn't." we maybe get in trouble in english sometimes because the existential verb and the copular are the same word. I've often wanted to be a native french speaker with their lovely distinctions between to have and to be. But alas, is is all i got. which is to say predicates are important to talking about the world. And also that talking about the world is maybe part of our form of life, or as heidegger would have it, is the with which that Dasein takes a stand on its always already being-in-the-world. but you're right, the world is not the stuff it is. the world is everything that is and is not anything that it isn't, and if you slice that
sentence up into first order predicate calculus you'll get a surprise about the domains in which there are free variables, and what exactly is the predicate of what. deep down I think "is the world" is a true predicate of "everything" and that "is not the world" is a true predicate of "anything else than everything."

which is possibly just a result of reading crazy german phenomenologists and the lasting damage that it can do to one's brain, but I actually think there's an important distinction to be shown there.

Eros/ion is a self-eroding, unstable cenotaph indexing love lost by =20

Blake, like lots of the dudes mentioned, was an artist first, trained at =
Henry Pars' drawing school, & then the Royal Academy, & that's how he =
earned his bread (as an engraver).  Cummings earned whatever bread he =

An essay to date (rough draft with numerous slots to be filled in) culled
from outlining: "The Mess of the True World"



The Mess of the True World


  what does it mean to be in-carnated within the real/virtual/
    true world?

Carnated/carnal/knowledge - We could begin by introducing the true world,
the world of mind in relation to ontological/epistemological shifting. The
true world is primordial, in other words backgrounding.

..."however, we use the word [_materialism_] in its dictionary definition
of _embodiment,_ in contract to _mind._ Thus, virtual reality, as dis-
cussed within the art literature [...] is materialist, regardless of
whether this experience is _real_ or _illusory._ Mental constructs, on the
other hand, are nonsensory and so have no material existence." Paul Fish=
wick, An Introduction to Aesthetic Computing, in Fishwick, ed., Aesthetic
Computing, MIT, 2006. In this sense, the true world is materialist; how-
ever I would argue that mental constructs cohere with the sensory, that a
fundamental entanglement exists. For example, love or hate create sensed
bodily transformations, mathematical thought creates the sensation of per-
ceived 'symbol-clouds,' and so forth.


  what are the edge-phenomena/plastic and static limits of the body?

The limits of my body within the true world are the limits of my world;
here I include ontological shifts such as mathesis, semiosis, emotions and
the like. Given the limited bandwidth of receptors of all sorts, and the
limitations of mind (for example, in thinking through the appearance of
the eighth dimension, calculating, speaking non-native languages, etc.),
thought and the true world are based on extrapolation - the _gestural_ -
as fundamental being. (See Tran Duc Thao on the origins of language.) The
gestural follows quantum non-distributive logics (see the early experi-
ments by Land on color vision), not Aristotelian distributive logics; this
being-in-the-world is partial reception of part-objects transformed into
inherency through gesture. All organisms have this in common.

The _plastic_ limits of the body are the limits of body-inherency, whether
'real' or 'virtual' or other category - the limits of the image carried by
the jectivity (introjection and projection) braid. The _static_ limits may
be considered formal-measureable limits, whether in one or another space.


  of the geopolitical body? of the political-economic body?

As soon as one brings domain-extrapolation of the body into play (i.e.
sexual body, material body, imaginary body, natural body, and so forth),
cultural nexus is paramount, and the body itself moves within theory as
phenomenological token or punctum.

And as soon as one brings variegated ontologies and epistemologies into
play, analysis becomes a mush/mess/mass or miss. Terms slide against
terms, carrying enormous overdetermined histories with them - but these
are the only histories there are.


  what are the signifiers of bodily arousal/violence/meditation?
  how are these constituted within the true world?

Herewith bee a liste of signes, or some such. But where is the arousal,
violence, meditation, if not brainward, wearing the exposure, softening,
hardening, quiescence of the body which simultaneously is foregrounded and
absenting. In terms of emanents, the signs are symbolic; one calculates,
applies them. In term of organism, the signs are ikonik, upwelling. The
brain manages none of this; the brain manages, is managed - everything
becomes a mess as inquiry tangles uselessly. It's this uselessness, this
nexus, that is of interest - an analytical failure in the close-rubbed maw
of the world.


  readings: what does it mean to read the real body? the virtual body?

One might begin by considering language as fundamentally ikonic, that
within the preconscious ('repository' of syntactics, short-term memory -
another metaphor) language is clothed, associated with the true world.
Language then is structured like the unconscious, and the unconscious does
not necessarily splay the real. Bodies, organic and emanent (and 'organic'
references the machinic phylum as well), inhere to mind, minding, tending,
a posteriori interpretation and hermeneutics. Reading the body is embody-
ing, is against the background of incarnation. Sheave-skins need not react
or appear to sense as organic skins; the feedback is often visual or
aural, not proprioceptive. Within the jectivity braid, this is an epistem-
ological issue, not one of fundamental locus. On the other hand (real or
virtual), one can abandon the emanent; abandoning the organic is deadly.
Proceed backwards from this, from the irretrievable, intolerable, finality
of death, and reading bodies, and bodily risk, become wildly disparate.
Nevertheless both inhabit the true world, mind inhabits both, albeit often
in qualitatively different manners, depending on ontology.


  what are the ontologies and epistemologies involved here?
  ontological status of the so-called virtual -
  schrodinger's cat paradox and collapse of the wave function as model
   for simultaneous analogic/digital readings -
  seeing through microscopy (tunnel, scanning, optical, etc.):
  are ontology and epistemology equivalent at the limit?
  (are analogic and digital equivalent at a parallel limit?)

What difference does it make? Begin with the mess, with the corrupted
reading of whatever consciousness has placed there, on the page, the rock,
the emanent body, the organic body. The last carries ikonic signs,
simultaneously indexical, pointing out the mute history of the being. If
there were only readers of everything! If only the book of nature existed!
The Ladder! Great Chain of Being!

Ontologies occur in local domains, rub raw against each other, problema-
tize each other. Who decided this one or that one as primordial? What's
fundamental is the mixed mess, the braid. At least as far as we're con-
cerned, the braid.


  internals and externals, static/dynamic. remnants of the visible
  human project, gendering of the visual/internal

Human skin under the microtome, sheave-skin burrowed into by camera
position. Here is the necessity of Madhyamika, co-dependent origination,
depend co-origination, braided mind, image, imaginary, entity, real and
virtual within, inhering to the true world. Striated, variegated trans-
formations characterize life; the Visible Human Project transforms
organism into emanent, habitus into data-basae.


  comfort, dis/comfort, ease, dis/ease, hysteria and abjection/fluid-
  ity (laycock's 1840 essay on hysteria, kristeva, chasseguet-smirgel)

Clearly the abject lies within the primordial, the braid is braid of
dissolution, corruption, decay; definitions flux in relation to the
contricted passing of time. Organisms flood themselves, emanents decay
with their corporations, software updating, diminishing dreamtimes as
elders die off. Hysteria is convulsion, but also spew, contrary and
wayward, the refusal of the body, just as death is such a refusal and
catatonia. Do others refuse the body? Use it? Reuse it? Are sheave-skins
exchanged? Does political economy depend on aegis?


  dis/ease, hysteria, and so forth of emanents

Dis/ease, etc. may be modeled; turning the emanent towards abjection is
necessarily a conscious decision. The hysteria of emanents is the hys-
teria of the steering mind. Proliferation of emanents, duplications and
other hacks, may be considered a form of hysteria. But hysteria is on
the surface; emanents which are autonomous or semi-autonomous agents may
exist the full range of symptoms, generated from within, without exter-
nal steering.


  medical model and technology

A medical model implies internal flows, striations, identities, vulner-
abilties, immunological defenses, maintenance and so forth. Emphasis is
on the cohering of parts, membranes and molecular channels. Organism
runs from within; emanent runs from without. An emanent may be defined
as _an image or apparition whose body and mind are elsewhere,_ an
entity that exists in relation to the jectivity braid, and has apparent,
but not genidentical, identity. Of course the organic body itself is
genidentical only to a limited extent.

One might say then that both ontologically and epistemologically, _an
emanent exists within data-bases or other entities spatio-temporally
distant from the visual or other residue._ What we see is surface, but
surface from both within and without. _The dissection of an emanent
image is the result of camera angle._


  psychoanalytics and technology, psychoanalytics of emanents

The psychoanalytics of emanents are two-fold: the psychoanalytics of
mind steering, and the internal psychoanalytics of the machinic phylum.


  analogic and worn emanent boundaries

  edge / boundary phenomena - physics and psychophysics of the game-
   world edge in second life


  phenomena of the sheave-skin and sheave-skin internals

Sheave-skin externals read as internals: anatomical mappings within Poser.


  phenomena of medical models in relation to edge/boundaries

The medical model is for learning, for analogy of surface to surface. The
medical model requires a (human) viewer. Any dissection into the substance
of an organic body results in exposed and constructed surfaces; interiors
always lie elsewhere, revealed by X-ray, MRI, and so forth.


  edge phenomena in literature, codework, mathesis of the text
    (cramer's and reith's programs)


  generalization of edge phenomena into the dialectic between tacit
  knowledge (polyani) and error (winograd/flores)


  what constitutes worlds? constructing?
  world of the text, inhabitation/dwelling/building (heidegger,
  dufrenne)


  what constitutes the true world? worlding?
  'true world' in which lines/angles are 'trued' (affine geometry),
  'true world' in the sense of 'trued' phenomenologies within which
  virtual, real, and ikonic are blurred and interpenetrating, somewhat
  equivalent, and within which traditional epistemologies of symbol/
  sign/signifier/signified/index/ikon etc. break down (kalachakra
    tantra, jeffrey hopkins)

  'reading' underlying (substructural, configuration files, guides)
  organization of mocap/scan through surface phenomena
  (and the relationship of this reading to waddington's epigenetic
  landscapes)


  who is world? communality, consensuality?
  the problem of other minds and the problem of consensual other minds
  (group hallucinations, vijnanavada, dwarf sitings, ufos, etc.)

--------------------------------------------

Above the world-weary horizons
New obstacles for exchange arise
Or unfold,
O ye postmasters!


1. About the Poetics List

With the preceding epigraph, the Poetics Listserv was founded by
Charles Bernstein in late 1993. Now in its fourth incarnation, the
list has over 1300 subscribers worldwide. We also have a substantial
number of nonsubscribing readers, who access the list through our web
site (see archive URL above).

The Poetics List is not a forum for a general discussion of poetry or
for the exchange of poems. Our aim is to support, inform, and extend
those directions in poetry that are committed to innovations,
renovations, and investigations of form and/or/as content, to the
questioning of received forms and styles, and to the creation of the
otherwise unimagined, untried, unexpected, improbable, and impossible.
While we recognize that other lists may sponsor other possibilities
for exchange, we request that those participating in this forum keep
in mind the specialized and focused nature of this project and respect
our decision to operate a moderated list. The Poetics List exists to
support and encourage divergent points of view on innovative forms of
modern and contemporary poetry and poetics, and we are committed to do
what is necessary to preserve this space for such dialog.

Due to the high number of subscribers, we no longer maintain the open
format with which the list began (at under 100 subscribers). The
specific form of moderation that we employ is a relatively fluid one:
in most cases, messages are reviewed after having been posted to the
list, and difficulties resolved on that basis; however, the listserv
editorial board may shift between this and a pre-review mode which
calls for all messages to be read and approved before being forwarded
to the list. We prefer to avoid this option as it hampers the
spontaneity of discussion that we hope to promote. In addition to
these options, the editorial board will unsubscribe individuals if
they are not, in our opinion, productively contributing to the list or
following our guidelines. We remain committed to this editorial
function as a defining element of the Poetics List.

Please also note that this is a not a general interest poetry list and
information about this list should not be posted to directories of
poetry lists. The idea is to keep the list membership to those with
specific engagement related to the list's stated orientation. The
current limits of the list are 75 messages per day, and a maximum of
four messages per subscriber per day; but these limits are subject to
change withouth notice.

In addition to being archived at through the EPC
(http://epc.buffalo.edu) and at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html, some posts to
Poetics (especially reviews, obituary notices, announcements, etc.)
may also become part of specific EPC subject areas.

Note also that Roof Books published Joel Kuszai's edited collection of
the Poetics List; this is available from ROOF and also on line at the
EPC.


2. Posting to the List

The Poetics List is a moderated list. All messages are reviewed by the
editors in keeping with the goals of the list as articulated in this
Welcome Message (see section 1).

Please note that while this list is primarily concerned with
discussions of poetry and poetics, messages relating to politics and
political activism, film, art, media, and so forth are also welcome.
We strongly encourage subscribers to post information, including web
links, relating to publications (print and internet), reading series,
and blogs that they have coordinated, edited, published, or in which
they appear. Such announcements constitute a core function of this
list. Brief reviews of poetry events and publications (print or
digital) are always welcome.

We generally do not accept postings of creative work not directed
toward a discussion of poetics issues on the list. The Poetics List is
not a venue for the posting of free-standing, personal poems or
journal entries. However, the Poetics List editor may occasionally
solicit or approve poems for posting on the list.

Also, please note that the Poetics List is not a "chat" list and we
discourage the posting of very short messages intended for only a few
subscribers.

All posts go out not only to list subscribers but also become a public
part of the list archive on the web. Note that posting to the list is
a form of publication and that by sending your message to the list you
formally consent to such web publication. Posts are currently being
indexed by search engines such as Google. It is not possible for us to
remove posts from the list archive or to control search engine
indexing of these posts.

Subscribers only may post to the Poetics List. Send messages directly
to the list address: poetics@listserv.buffalo.edu.


3. Subscriptions

*For all subscription requests go to
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html.

*To subscribe for the first time click on "Subscribe (join) a List."
Immediately following your subscription to the poetics listserv we ask
that you email poetics@buffalo.edu, subject-line "registration," with
your full name, street address, email address, and telephone number.
Failure to register at the time of subscription will result in
automatic deletion from the subscription roll.

*To manage your subscription (for descriptions of the different
subscription options please see section 3), click on "Subscriber's
Corner."

Subscriptions to the Poetics List are free of charge, but formal
registration is required. All other questions about subscriptions,
whether about an individual subscription or subscription policy,
should be addressed to this same administrative address.

PLEASE NOTE: All subscription-related information and correspondence
remains absolutely confidential.

All posts to the list must provide your full real name, as registered.
If there is any discrepancy between your full name as it appears in
the "from" line of the message header, please sign your post at the
bottom. Subscribers who do not include their full name with each post
will be unsubscribed form the list.

The most frequent problem with subscriptions is bounced messages. If
your system is often down or if you have a low disk quota, Poetics
messages may get bounced, which will result in your subscription being
automatically terminated by the Listserv program and the automatically
generated message telling you that this has occurred will also likely
bounce. If this happens, you may re-subscribe to the list by the same
process described above. One remedy to avoid this happening in the
future: set your list options to "no-mail" and read the list on the
web.

4. Subscription Options

We encourage you to alter your subscription options via the link on
the right side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html. If you would
prefer not to use the web-interface, you may also email
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> the following commands:

*to subscribe to the Poetics listserv send
listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu this one-line message with no "subject":
sub poetics [your Firstname and Lastname]

*RECOMMENDED: if you wish to read the list on our web interface and
not receive any messages sent directly, while remaining subscribed to
the list and so eligible to send us posts, send this one-line message
to <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": set poetics
nomail. Note: this option is also useful for temporary suspension of
email service.

*to reactivate Poetics e-mail send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu>
this one-line message with no "subject": set poetics mail

* to receive the list in digest form (you will receive the day's
individual posts in one email sent just after midnight EST), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics digest

*to receive posts in the default option (you will receive individual
postings immediately), send <listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-
line message with no "subject": set poetics nodigest

* to receive the list in index form (you will receive a list, without
the text of the posts, of the subjects discussed each day along with
the author's name and address and the number of lines it comprises;
you can also choose to have the index sent to you in either plain text
or in HTML format with hyperlinks), send
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> this one-line message with no
"subject": set poetics nohtml index --or-- set poetics html index

PLEASE NOTE: do not leave your Poetics subscription in default or
digest mode if you are going to be away for any extended period of
time. Your account may become flooded and you may lose Poetics
messages as well as other important mail. In such cases, switch your
subscription to "nomail" as recommended above.

5. To Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe (or change any of your subscription options), again, we
strongly encourage you to go to the right-hand side of the screen at
http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/poetics.html You may also
may unsubscribe by sending a one-line email to
<listserv@listserv.buffalo.edu> with no "subject": unsub poetics

If you are having difficulty unsubscribing, please note: sometimes
your e-mail address may be changed slightly by your system
administrator. If this happens you will not be able to send messages
to Poetics or to unsubscribe, although you will continue to receive
mail from the Poetics List. To avoid this problem, unsub using your
old address, then resubscribe with your new email address.


6. Cautions

"Flame" messages will not be tolerated on the Poetics List. We define
'flaming' as any post that resembles a personal attack or personal
insult to anyone--subscriber or not. This of course includes racist,
sexist, or other slurs as well as ad hominem arguments in which the
person rather than their work is attacked; in other words while
critique of a person's work is welcome (critical inquiry is one of the
main functions of the list), this critique cannot extend to a critique
or criticism of the person.

The listserv is intended to be a productive communal space for
discussion and announcements; as such, subscribers who do not follow
listserv policy will be removed from the subscription roll.

In enforcing this policy, the editors must consider sometimes
competing interests. The basis for our decisions, however, rests with
our collective judgment about the kind of space we want for the list.

For reasons of basic security, we do not allow pseudonymous
subscriptions. All messages intended for the Poetics List should be
sent in Text-Only format, without attachments. We do not accept
HTML-formatted messages or attached files. As a general rule, keep
individual posts to 1,000 words or less.

Please do not publish list postings without the express permission of
the author. Posting on the list is a form of publication. Copyright
for all material posted on Poetics remains with the author; material
from this list and its archive may not be reproduced without the
author's permission, beyond the standard rights accorded by "fair use"
of published materials.

All material on the Poetics List remains the property of the authors;
before you reproduce this material, in whole or in part, we ask that
you get permission (by email is fine) from the authors. If they give
permission, then we ask only that you say that the post or posts
appeared originally on the Poetics List
(http://epc.buffalo.edu/poetics/welcome.html) on [give date and say:]
Used by permission of the author.

As an outside maximum, we will accept no more than 4 messages per day
from any one subscriber. Also, given that our goal is a manageable
list (manageable both for moderators and subscribers), the list
accepts 75 or fewer messages per day, though these paramenters may be
changed at the discretion of the list moderator.

Like all systems, the listserv will sometimes be down: if you feel
your message has been delayed or lost, *please wait at least one day
to see if it shows up*, then check the archive to be sure the message
is not posted there; if you still feel there is a problem, you may
wish to contact the editors at <poetics.list@gmail.com>.

Dear listservers,

I am teaching a Creative Writing class to an  Adult and Continuing Ed  group  this semester and would like your suggestions (if you choose to comment) about  how to deal with  publication advice.  I am mainly a poet writer so I already know what to tell them about sending out the various forms of poetry. But this group of 8 people come from all walks, two of them have Master degrees in Engineering and Medical Education, some are housewives only interested in memoir writing, others just seem to be exploring this side of themselves,  and  there is a young man  who  is very good at describing landscapes.  I have read each ones first pass using an exercise I learned from one of the Creative Writing classes I've taken so I've just begun to assess their writing. For the most part, they all seem to be very imaginative, above average in their writing skills, and serious about writing.  I  know what to say about that.  But I am not a fiction writer-----prose poems--oh yes!   And I
 am introducing them to flash fiction  or sudden fiction but I do not know where  that genre  is received  as it is so new to me.  Also, I am familiar with the recent discussion of Japanese cellphone fiction (although this group is older and probably not interested in writing like that). If anyone has suggestions about  e-zine fiction writing /submitting, I would appreciate it.

I believe it is safe to tell them to start small --perhaps short story writing, but there is one lady who has written a book of journaling.   I have only begun to look at an entry into the volumes she is producing.   Finally this is a four week class for beginners that only meets two hours per week.  I am talking to them about being able to critique their own work, finding a writers group to support them after this class, and writing as a discipline every day, plus the importance of sending out their work.

If any of you  have suggestion for me about publication for this group, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you. Sheila Black

One thing I would say is that you don't seem to be making any kind of
distinction between any small group and an elite. Surely the
distinguishing characteristic of an elite is NOT the number of people in a
specific group.

There are comparatively few electrical engineers in the United States, are
they an elite? There's a comparatively small number of checkout clerks at
grocery stores; does this constitute an elite?

Yves Klein intrigued me for years, but I had a rather sketchy perspective, =
never having owned and read the best printed material by and about him (eve=
n lucky to have scouted one early French catalogue).  My hope was that Fran=
cois Levy-Kuentz's documentary on Yves Klein ("La revolution bleue", 2006, =
52 minutes). might include some archival footage--unaware that Klein had ar=
ranged for filmic documentation of the major moves in his life/career.  Wha=
t a dazzling figure!  And that career trajectory!  As I was leaving the Nat=
ional Gallery of Art, a stunned spectator asked me whether the film documen=
ted an actual person or whether an imaginary being had been concocted by Le=
vy-Kuentz=20
=20
In addition, this doc necessarily presents otherwise unavailable footage of=
 Pierre Restany and the Nouveaux Realistes (Klein, Jean Tinguely, Arman, Da=
niel Spoerri, Cesar, and Francois Dufrene [performing sound poetry]).  Othe=
rs involved with the Nouveaux Realistes (but not imaged in the film) includ=
ed Martial Raysse, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle, and last but n=
ot least, Christo joined the group in 1963.  I'm tempted to offer compariso=
ns to literary manifestations which also emerged in 1960, but . . . "La Rev=
olution Bleue" is available on DVD if you don't want to wait until it's scr=
eened within a visual art context in your geographic range.  I think this f=
ilm will get somewhat overlooked, and therefore want to alert you to the gr=
eat archival film footage directed by the auteur Yves Klein which it makes =
accessible.  Forget whatever images remain with you from the film which met=
aphorically killed him, "Mondo Cane".http://www.artfifa.com/index.php?optio=

work in the context of other texts selected and made available in advance
by the poet. The event provides a forum for discussing the practice and
theory of writing and reading poetry -- including practices and theories
of prefixing poetry ("anti-"; "non-"), adjectivizing poetry ("poetic"),
and capitalizing poetry (first letter; letters at random). Poetry
prismatically refracts social, political, scientific, aesthetic languages,
transforming them into something exciting and strange. How does poetic
form do that? This series explores questions about the language of poetry,
offering readers and writers a multi-dimensional experience of the shapes
and sounds of contemporary poetry by inviting leading and emerging
innovative practitioners of the art. Next event in the series: Carla
Harryman, 24 March, 4-5:30 pm, Katzman Lounge. Further info,
lcabri@uwindsor.ca

Rita Wong's events are funded by The Canada Council, Artcite, University
of Windsor Department of English Language, Literature and Creative
Writing, and with support from Dr. Stephen Pender, Research Leadership
Chair, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.

Both the talk and reading are free - as in all welcome.

Although best known as a sculptor, Carl Andre is an outstanding poet.=0A=0A=
In case anyone is interested, here is the text of a review I wrote of a 199=
4 exhibition of his poetry:=0A=0A=0A=0ACARL ANDRE=0APAULA COOPER GALLERY=0A=
 =0ACan visual art and poetry be one and the same?  Displaying 600 pages of=
 writing in vitrines on gallery walls as though they were drawings certainl=
y frustrates some of the usual desiderata for reading poetry.  Carl Andre's=
 exhibition Words consisted of some 600 sheets typed by the artist between =
1957 and 1980.  Normally,  the poet's hand is nothing to his poem, and no t=
ypeface used to reproduce it is likely to effect the poem's existence.  Yet=
 the display of Andre's poems as holograph sheets, while making it difficul=
t to read them, does put us in the frame of mind to see them.  That they we=
re produced on a manual typewriter doesn't hurt either; a medium's obsolesc=
ence cues us to see it aesthetically.  The physical weight of the type bar'=
s imprint, the density of ink conveyed, and of course the distinction betwe=
en black and red ribbons--such factors begin to take on quasi-sculptural or=
 pictorial weight when the poems are presented in this manner.  But all
 these qualities would not count for much if the typed texts were not apt t=
o receive or "absorb" them.  At its most interesting, Andre's poetry eschew=
s standard phrasing and syntax to subject language to a "systematic derange=
ment," whether by turning words into abstract visual patterns through the r=
epetition of component letters, using the alphabetical order of initial let=
ters as an ordering structure, or using the length of words in the same way=
, as in "preface to the work itself," 1963, which proceeds from two-letter =
words like "in" and "is" through three-letter words, four-letters words, an=
d on to "clastic, stacked, identical, interchangeable."=0A     But the effe=
ct of Andre's repetitions and systems is not abstract or merely methodical.=
  Since the entire effort of his poetry involves the disengagement of words=
 from syntax, their isolation and analysis as (in Andre's words) "palpable =
tactile qualities" in their own right, the presentation's emphasis on the p=
oems' physical realization merely elicits a quality already inherent in the=
m as texts.  The poems irresistibly conjure character, narrative, and setti=
ng (many sequences are called "novels" or "operas"), though leaving these u=
ncannily distant and unknowable.  Their repetitions are more mythic or fata=
listic than formal or musical.  Particularly as it emerges from this ambien=
t presentation, Andre's poetry evokes a stark, elemental landscape in which=
 figures and objects (that is, words) stand out in the intense relief of an=
 immobile noon or dissolve in its unforgiving glare.  While it may be tempt=
ing to see his poetry in relation to a new
 generation of artists who work with language but are not "conceptual"--art=
ists as different as Kenneth Goldsmith and Sean Landers--it is important to=
 keep in mind that its approximation to the condition of visual art is actu=
ally contingent on a project that is irreducibly poetic, though (like the c=
ontemporaneous work of John Cage or Jackson Mac Low) transgressive of the c=
onventions of poetry.=0A=0A=0A----- Original Message ----=0AFrom: steve d. =

 While we are on this subject, another interesting angle is poets who are partnered  with visual artists or curators and what may or may not be the impact of the partner's eye and use of the medium on the making of the poet's work.
 Additionally, one could also include, poets who write on the visual arts, when the art has formed a kind of 'marriage'  with  poetry making.
 I think this question is greater than keeping the focus on 'quality switch-hitters.'   The dance of various kinds of partners (poets and the world of viz) - the way they inform each other can be equally rich. Thinking at the moment of Mei-Mei B and R. Tuttle - for example.
 Nor should anyone think that these partnerships magically lead to great painterly poems or, conversely rich literary art works.  Hey doodle-do! Yeah, that, too!

A big topic (or pair of topics). My wife is an artist and we have certainly influenced each other profoundly over the years through our work. Over the past three years, she has been working on an ongoing artwork that takes the form of e-mail, several days a week, usually encompassing both a photographic image and text. What's curious is that while she undertook this work under the aegis of art, many people who have been following the work (including some pretty fine poets) have received it as poetry, rather than as art. And she has been willing to take that on board.

THE CLOCK MAKER'S MEMOIR
by Dan Featherston=20

Advanced praise for The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir:

Through a series of poised, meditative stanzas, The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir
takes on the formidable topics of time and memory. What=B9s evident throughou=
t
this book is a careful craftsmanship leading to novel perspectives all
around the clock.=20
=8B Lisa Jarnot=20

The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir registers the world=B9s variety in small catalogs of
storms, shadows, dreams, memories, and rituals of childhood. In such forms,
time returns each time with a difference. Likewise, the supple measure of
these poems returns us to a rhythm or tone each time with a difference,
sounding a subtle echo of slipped in sleep. As William Blake declares,
=B3There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find / Nor can his Watch
Fiends find it.=B2 Yet Dan Featherston finds it =8B through alert and
resourceful art.=20
=8B Devin Johnston=20

With its precise music, The Clock Maker=B9s Memoir navigates the immeasurable
distance between the clock=B9s face and the face worn by lived experiences. I=
n
these poems, memoir is not some static repository: it is a poesis of the
present tense. Featherston=B9s craft and his unblinking commitment to
particulars fashion a lyric search that one can trust to ask the questions,
the necessary questions of time, space, and how we find one another amidst
all this memory.=20

Some years ago, there was a show of visual art by poets at a gallery on Rivington St. called ABC No Rio.  This show was organized by Bruce Weber, a poet who is also an art curator or who was at that time.  I saw many wonderful things in it.  I remember Steve Dalachinsky being in it.  He has a great deal of experience with making visual art, usually collages.  I, on the other hand, can't draw to save my life.  I exhibited a poem from my next book, coming out this spring, with a beautiful abstract made to go with the poem by an accomplished artist named Brian Gormley.  I admire and respect poets who have the gift of visual art as well, whether I have that gift or not, which it appears I do not.  My extra-literary gifts appear to be musical rather than visual arts oriented.  Anyway,  someone with access to the list of works shown in that show would have a pretty good list of current poets in downtown NYC who are also visual artists.  Regards, Tom Savage

Eileen Callahan has sent on the news that her husband, Bob Callahan, passed away last night. A San Francisco Bay Area presence since the seventies, during which he and Eileen were publishers of Turtle Island Books, initially he was deeply involved in literature and history of western, indigenous cultures. He and Eileen brought Jaime d'Angulo's work back into print including Indians in Coveralls, a beautiful letter press edition of 5 or 6 books. They were both involved in exploring Charles Olson's curriculum and its relationship to the geography and bio-regional cultures of the west. He also had a strong admiration and friendship with Ed Dorn in this context.

 Eventually, Bob, a native of Boston, turned much of his attention to the history of the Irish -  writing and music - in America. In the last couple of decades he became absorbed in the publishing of graphic novels.

 The history is much larger, and my account here is probably meager in proportion. A terrifically intelligent, articulate and politically aware man, if he had not moved west and turned his ear to the practice of literature and publishing, he would have been a great local politician, a pro at working the Boston precincts for votes. In fact, he was a friend of the late, Senator Tip O'Neil. If the muses had not got his tail, he would have been great working at O'Neil's side.  But what he added to the community in books, conversation, story and, probably, no little amount of blarney was plenty important and generous to many of us.

 Hearts out to Eileen and their son, David.

He gave me the gift of Jaime de Angulo, for which I'm eternally
grateful. And from Turtle Island's books it was a short hop to de
Angulo's Indian Tales, one of the great American books.

At the risk of appearing entirely self-serving (!), for  folks going  to the AWP Book Fair, my book, WALKING THEORY can be found at Junction Press, Americas Hall 2, table 495. Joined by a number of other fine titles, as well. 20% discount, too.

 Chax Press will be sharing the same table. For a total knock out Jeff Clark design job, and a great Chax book, check out Hilton Obenzinger's brand new BUSY DYING  - a novel that I had the pleasure of editing. What's it about? And why is it timely? Columbia 1968! Hilton, along with Paul Auster, David Schapiro and other still familiar folks took over and occupied the President's Office (Now already 40 years ago). (Yes, a reunion is going to happen on campus on the weekend of April 23rd.) Or as Bill Berkson lays it out the backcover blurb:
 No one tells the story of the Columbia University variation of Apocalypse 1968 -- its prelude and its up-to-date fallout (e.g., This Is Your Life) -- better than Poet-and-Communard-in-Residence of that and other histories, Hilton Obenzinger. When Politics meant something other than Brute Force, Obenzinger was there, observing and making it happen, like one breath in, another out. In deft, benign, deep and often hilarious prose, he has kept the faith.

 Enjoy the Fair.

the chest and groin


among sites hidden nightly from one another
are chest and groin, no matter what bother
one sticks to, male or female blend,
and chest and groin come to untimely end

a hand moves, fingers, thrust and throb, then silence
death hangs tattered on the scanner's fence
gender falters in ungainly weather
somewhere worlds collapse, one's metal mother

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Three blocks from my apartment, Flor Crisostomo has
taken refuge in the same Chicago store-front church
where Elvira Arellano lived in protest for more than
one year.  Like Elvira, Flor Crisostomo is actively
disobeying an order by the Department of Homeland
Security to turn herself in for deportation.

CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE:
Refusal to obey governmental demands or commands
especially as a nonviolent and usually collective
means of forcing concessions from the government

The U.S. immigration system is broken (and health care
and education and social security). And this is no
surprise. Our government has never handed out change.
People have had to demand change again and again: the
right to vote, to unionize, to have an abortion. In
all of these cases, individuals have stepped forward
to test the system and create a historical record for
change.

IF YOU HAVE RESOURCES TO SHARE
OR WANT TO GET INVOLVED, CONTACT THE CHURCH:
Adalberto United Methodist Church
2716 W Division St, Chicago, IL
(773) 523-8261

Illegal immigrant vows to stand ground
HUMBOLDT PARK (Chicago, IL)
Holed up in same church where Arellano held out

BY KARA SPAK Staff Reporter, Chicago Sun Times

Saying she hoped the fear of God would keep federal
agents away, undocumented immigrant Flor Crisostomo on
Monday vowed to stay in a Humboldt Park church
indefinitely to keep Congress focused on immigration
reform.

Tears streaming down her cheeks, a defiant Crisostomo
said she did not believe she was breaking U.S. law,
nor did she see herself as hiding.

Arrested in an immigration raid in April 2006, she was
ordered to leave the country voluntarily by Jan. 28.
Crisostomo sought "sanctuary" in the Adalberto United
Methodist Church, the same church that housed
undocumented immigrant Elvira Arellano and Arellano's
U.S.-born son Saul, for more than a year.

"I am taking a stand of civil disobedience to make
America see what they are doing," Crisostomo said in a
statement that was translated into English. Speaking
in broken English, she said immigrants are not
terrorists but hard-working people contributing to the
economy.

"The real problem is the color and the language," she
said.

U.S. immigration officials saw the issue differently,
releasing a statement that said Crisostomo was given a
voluntary departure order Oct. 12, 2006. After an
appeal failed in December 2007, she was given 60 more
days to leave the country on her own.

"Ms. Crisostomo will be taken into custody at an
appropriate time and place with consideration given to
the safety of all involved," read the statement
released by Gail Montenegro, spokesperson for U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Children back in Mexico
Montenegro said that it is also illegal to "knowingly
harbor an illegal alien," and those who do so can be
subject to criminal prosecution.

Unlike Arellano, who was living with her son, Saul, at
the church, Crisostomo's three children, ages 14, 11
and 9, live with their grandmother in Mexico.

Crisostomo, 28, left her children in Guerrero, Mexico,
seven years ago to work illegally in the United
States. She was arrested April 19, 2006, during an
immigration raid at a pallet factory where she earned
$300 a week.

Arellano lived in the church for more than a year. She
left in August 2007 to attend an immigration rally in
California, where federal authorities arrested and
deported her.

Numerous portraits of Arellano hang inside the church,
and she called the press conference from her Mexican
home to wish Crisostomo luck.

LIFT OFF! REMEMBERING
THOMAS CHAPIN

– CONCERTS MARK DECADE SINCE THE PASSING OF AVANT JAZZ MASTER –



New York, NY - Rarely in a musical movement has a player left an
indelible mark on those with whom he collaborated and those listeners
with whom he enthralled more than the late NYC avant jazz saxist, Thomas
Chapin. To commemorate this gifted, multi-instrumentalist-composer and to
mark the decade since his passing, two NYC concerts are planned by his
widow, Terri Castillo-Chapin, with the help of Thomas' many friends and
musical colleagues.  Entitled LIFT OFF! REMEMBERING THOMAS CHAPIN, the
concerts will take place in NYC on Wednesday, February 13 at St. Peter's
Church at 6:30 pm (619 Lexigington Ave. at East 54th St. – admission
free), and on Friday, February 15, 2008 at the Bowery Poetry Club at 8:00
pm (308 Bowery at Bleecker St. – admission $15).

Since his untimely death from leukemia in 1998 at the otherwise emerging
age of 40, the music and playing of Thomas Chapin continues to be a
highly influential and inspirational force to those who knew him and to
those who continue to know him through his music and example. Even a
decade after his death, a newly awakened school of disciples and a
newfound generation of jazz enthusiasts of his unique and emancipated
musical expression grow. Renowned downtown-saxophonist John Zorn, who
performed and recorded with Chapin in the 90's, recalls Chapin as "The
real deal. A complete musician in every sense, he created work that was
honest, imaginative, well crafted and cathartic. Putting himself into
each and every note, he played with a rare and intense passion. His
energy was absolutely astounding. He is sorely missed."

The series title, LIFT OFF! REMEMBERING THOMAS CHAPIN, refers to what
peers and critics said after Chapin passed all too quickly: that his
brilliant career was taking off and he was just gaining altitude when he
was "cut down." These concerts return to that moment and many of Chapin's
core devotees will offer a musical salute.

The February 13th concert, "THOMAS CHAPIN: HIGHER AND HIGHER" will
feature Chapin's musical collaborators, including the original Thomas
Chapin Trio members, bassist Mario Pavone and drummer Michael Sarin,
performing with Frank Kimbrough, piano and Steven Bernstein, trumpet and
slide trumpet.   Soundpainter Walter Thompson traveling from Sweden,
along with Paul Jeffrey, legendary tenor saxophonist and teacher-mentor
of Chapin at Rutgers, will debut and direct The New Thomas Chapin
Orchestra, a 15-piece big band featuring former members of the
innovative, experimental ensemble The Walter Thompson Orchestra, of which
Chapin was a member in the '90's. Performing on February 13th will be:
Alan Chase, Michael Blake, Michael Attias and David CasT on saxophones,
Frank London, Steven Bernstein, Herb Robertson, Ron Horton, Steve Swell
and Bob Hovey on brass, Rolf Sturm, Tomas Ulrich, Joe Fonda and Pablo
Aslan on strings, and Hollis Hedrich on percussion.

Also on the program are Paul Jeffrey Ensemble with Mike Rabinowitz,
bassoon, and John Colanni, piano; pianist Armen Donelian with Marc
Mommaas, tenor sax; bassist Pablo Aslan's Avantango with Oscar Feldman,
sax, and Emilio Solla, piano; and Spirits Rebellious Quartet with Arthur
Kell, bass, Saul Rubin, guitar, and Art Baron, trombone, representing
Chapin's Brazilian explorations; Dutch artists Ineke van Doorn, voice,
and Marc Van Vugt, guitar; poet Steve Dalachinsky; and additional guests,
plus films of Chapin.

The February 15th concert,  "THOMAS CHAPIN: HIGHER STILL" continues to
celebrate Chapin's legacy with an interdisciplinary mix of poets, music
ensembles, guest speakers and film clips of Thomas Chapin performances.
Scheduled to appear is the Quartet of Mario Pavone and Michael Sarin,
along with celebrated reedist Marty Ehrlich and trombonist Pete
McEachern, playing some of Thomas Chapin's most acclaimed Trio pieces.
The evening showcases another legend, James Spaulding, offering an
original tune for solo flute, "Time to Go".  Written for fallen heroes
Dr. King and Malcolm X, Spaulding says, "Somehow the words remind me of
Tom's leaving us at such a young and vibrant age. I believe, were Tom
here, still amongst us, his musical achievements would parallel those of
the most recognized of our peers."

Others in the February 15th lineup include Paul Jeffrey, Walter Thompson
and a reprise of the premiering New Thomas Chapin Orchestra; a poet-group
with John Richey, Steve Dalachinsky, guitarist Robert Musso, Jair-Rohm
Parker Wells and Josh Harris (former members with Chapin of Machine Gun);
guiatrist Michael Musillami Trio with bassist Joe Fonda and drummer
George Schuller; multi-reed tone scientist Elliot Levin; and
next-generation saxophonist Brett Ryan, who never met Thomas but has been
deeply influenced by him.  Ryan will perform the concert's "Lift Off!"
theme, a rocket-fueled 1991 original Chapin piece by the same name,
fitting the events' celebratory, upward-trajectory spirit.

Alto saxophonist and flautist, Thomas Chapin forged his name in music as
a free expressionist.  A versatile multi-instrumentalist, bandleader and
composer in the 80s and 90s, Chapin led a trio performing his own music
playing in New York City's downtown scene and at festivals and clubs
around the world.  He was also an outstanding composer for larger groups,
and sometimes augmented the trio with strings and horn ensembles. Thomas
Chapin left behind a legacy of recognized albums and performances. The
New York Times called him "one of the more exuberant saxophonists and
bandleaders in jazz" and "one of the few musicians to exist in both the
worlds of the downtown, experimentalist scene and mainstream jazz."

Proceeds from the events will benefit Akasha, Inc., a non-profit whose
mission is to preserve the musical legacy of Thomas Chapin (donate at
thomaschapin.com/akasha.php), and the Jazz Foundation of America, a
national non-profit whose Musician's Emergency Fund provides financial
assistance and support services for musicians facing illness or in crisis
(jazzfoundation.org).  These events are made possible in part by the
generous support of Playscape Recordings, Downtown Music Gallery,
AllAboutJazz.com and LiveWired NYC.
