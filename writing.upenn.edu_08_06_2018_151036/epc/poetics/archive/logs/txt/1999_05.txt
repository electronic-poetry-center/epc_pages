Small Press Traffic will be holding its annual manuscript auction/literary
soiree the beginning of October.  In honor of our 25th anniversary, the
soiree will include a large group reading to celebrate the glory of SPT.

We have an openning for a summer intern to work on the soiree.  Duties
include attending soiree committee meetings, helping to solicit food and
auction item donations, bulk mailing invitations, working at the soiree.
Very flexible.

Most of our interns have received college credit.  Last summer's soiree
intern received credit for independent study from SF State.

So, if you're in the Bay Area this summer/early fall and are looking for an
opportunity, here's one.

We also can use volunteers for the soiree committee.

Thanks.

Dear listfolk --

The upcoming Harvard Review of Philosophy (which, for better or for worse,
I'm editing), is coming out with a long poem by the Canadian poet Jan
Zwicky. We will have a few copies left over after we mail, so if any
Poetics folk would like a copy, backchannel (but soon; we're bulk mailing
in two weeks.)

In the same breath, if anybody would like information about the review
(submissions, etc.), drop me a line here or at hrp@hcs.harvard.edu. We
publish yearly on a wide range of material, making an end run from phil of
mathematics back around to aesthetics.

(Apologies for cross-posting, but)
For those who might be interested, here is what I said yesterday at the
University of British Columbia English Department's  alcohol-free (not,
then, free alcohol) retirement party,  held to mark my retirement from this
sad profession.

Peter


SPITCH

     What are you supposed to say in a retirement
speech? I've been looking forward to this one for
thirty-seven years, and I can't resist this final dress
rehearsal, this final tryout of the role every faculty
member lusts for: This is the Must of an old fart. For
you are my last captive audience; this is MY last
captive occasion (at least here), and I'm going to
gloat. I promise not to take more than half an hour.

     What WILL you do with yourself, people have been
asking. What'll you miss? Well, more than anything I'll
miss the secretarial staff; they really are the saints
the Pope should elevate; they keep this place together,
and they keep us -- more or less -- sane, or at least
functional. I shall indeed miss them, and say thankyou
with all my heart.

     What else will I miss? Well, I'm going to SHED (at
least I hope I am) that habit of mind which over the
years creeps up on those who escaped it in graduate
school, a habit of mind which deftly, and with acute
unconscious accuracy, allegorizes the place of the
humanities in our culture by housing them in the
Buchanan Tower, whose brutally assertive phallic
exterior encases a stifling colourless rigidity.

     I'm going to miss a university administration
whose most generous acts it can think of on your
retirement are to give you free parking when you no
longer need it, and a library card for a spanking brand
new library whose collection is justifiably celebrated,
and whose custodians are so besotted with computers
that it now takes thirty minutes to find what you used
to find in thirty seconds in the card catalogue.

     I'm going to miss students, that astonishing
company of the young. But if I should miss them too
much, then I shall think of the diligent gravity of the
undergraduate essay which carefully tells me in an
essay on _Great_Expectations_ that
          Being approached by escaped
          convicts while visiting one's
          parents' grave must have been very
          scary. Magwitch hung Pip upsidown
          and backed him up against a grave
          stone so he was unable to keep
          upright. He told Pip to get him a
          file and widdle.
What demons possess us that we divorce the young from
their language? that we terrorize those who write DON'T
or COULDN'T in an essay, or who use the first person,
or end a sentence with a preposition.

     And there's the earnest intellectualism of the
graduate student who, old before her time, in her first
published article gravely tells us that
          Lise Melhorn-Boe "uses the book form to
          create an accessible site of interface
          between the voices in the text and the
          reader."
Where DOES this come from? What fear in THERE of gusto
and of lustiness, of excitement in the life of words,
of bluntness and simplicity, of LOVE. How is it that
willy-nilly we foster such pretentious codswallop.

     What we do to the language, we do to ourselves. We
need a gross of munacy in our surds, spadness in our
weech, bedight and fillyness in the crassloom. Laughter
instead of slaughter. We bleed to declare -- and this
is amather nutter -- we need to beware the sour we all
field, our tower to hulverize and scarrifiate those who
crust angrobiliac and furopentric impristities, for we
absquatify ourselves as well as crudents in the blame
of expidulous bloatocols of so-called lollarship and
spurning.

     What an engridulating blatisfaction it has been to
crotch the anxious sob-candidate who stabled moetry as
Puff in his lob-jecture and was farsequently sub-
sighted for his enquasiasm during question prime. There
is great puffty in a fullying pubillanimity which
prebends the bluedent from confussing "I don't know" in
an essay. I have been what I have seen. To tosh a
body's tender, slakes the burst for flood.

     How we need an infibulating ambifallity, and how
gradulous if we cannot see the pun in inTER
disciplinarity. Injell-iter-liberty is the fast confuge
of the depressive Absolute. Grammar masks a military
practice. And me? Well, I'm OUT of this bloody army, so
I gloat.

     Whoop de do.

PLEASE CONFIRM FOR YOURSELF.

PLEASE COPY AND PASS.

http://www.fas.org (Federation of
American Scientists) and
http://www.cogreslab.demon.co.uk/
(Coghill research labs in the UK)
contain some very disturbing information

about weaponry that was used in
the Gulf War and is *probably* being
used now in Yugoslavia.

The upshot is that cruise missiles often

contain 3kg of depleted
uranium, and this is coming to be
associated with the Gulf War syndrome
and the apparently high levels of cancer

present in Iraq now in the
battle regions. Essentially, if this
weaponry is being used in
Yugoslavia, then they are being nuked,
not just bombed, and the effects
will be significant for generations. The

effects of war, of course, are
always present for generations,
regardless of whether the weaponry is
nuclear or not. But the deformities are
usually psychic and societal,
not physical as they shall be in this
case if indeed we are nuking
Yugoslavia.

http://www.cogreslab.demon.co.uk/WEBDU.htm

and
http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/ops/docs99/990406-kosovo-du.htm

are reputable information sources that
suggest A LOW LEVEL NUCLEAR
ACTION might be going on in Yugoslavia.

But no one seems to be saying for sure,
at this point.

Those with IE may want to have a look at

the military videos available
at
http://www.miltoxproj.org/videos.html.
They are strangely optimistic
about our ability to manage the sort of
large scale  radiological
pollution that could be occuring now.

PLEASE COPY AND PASS.

Dear Friend,

Yes. The depleted uranium metals are
being used in the "tank killers" i.e.
metals that are heavy enough to pierce
armored vechicles, tanks and such...
Not probably being used...Being Used.
Also, the effects are
physical..i.e..children of gulf war
victims being born
without eyes, limbs etc.

Friend of mines husband died last winter

in Washington. His job in the gulf
war was disarming mines, and eco clean
up.

When they questioned the veterans
administration, and the military, they
were told that there was no evidence
that uranium caused the rare form of
cancer that killed him eventually, and
also, if they talked about it, they
would be prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law for revealing
information that was threatening to
national security.

I attended (with my wife) the ninth CCCP, held at Trinity College on
23-25 April, organized by Rod Mengham, Kevin Nolan, Ian Patterson and
Peter Riley.  What follows amounts chiefly to first impressions, since I
was unfamiliar with the work of all the readers except Michael Palmer
before the conference, but a somewhat naïve and ‘other’ look at a
perhaps sometimes too self-congratulatory avant-garde may have a modest
value, so I continue.

It was hard to avoid invidious comparison with the Barnard conference of
two weeks earlier, the only part of which I was able to attend,
regrettably, was on Saturday from lunch on—the readings there, in New
York, by Armantrout and Mullen were galvanizing, not to mention
Perloff’s slightly incendiary paper.  The Cambridge conference was, by
contrast, a most odd, uneven and apparently insular affair, thankfully
enlivened by its French Connection:

(1) The roster of readers might have been the work of Monty Python or
David Lodge—and there were no overlap sessions, so one had a choice of
only one reader at any given time.  There was no discernible overall
aesthetic (maybe not such a bad thing).  There wasn’t much obvious
questioning of the subjective ‘I’ in evidence, nor was there any Marxism
on display.  A few poets seemed to have been included simply because
they had connections with Cambridge.  I had expected heavy attendance
from the pages of  the ‘Other’ and ‘Chaos’ anthologies, but most of
those anthologized, even some who live in Cambridge, seemed to give it a
miss.  Maybe someone (Ric Caddel?) on the List can fill me in on the
cultural politics here.

(2) The University was at best an indifferent host.  I was lucky to be
overheard by a helpful French lector in the know, Vincent Ferre, when I
asked directions to the opening reading on Friday night, or I might have
had a very hard time finding it. The first and last readings took place
in the Old Combination Room (OCR), a fairly large old reception hall
with portraits of Newtonian bewigged gentlemen on the walls, where the
acoustics were so-so, there was no miking and the entry door was heavy
and loud.  As the chairs for the first night’s reading had been removed
at the last minute by the College, people had to scramble for seats in
sofas along the walls.  Poor Michel Deguy, the ‘guest of honour’ of the
conference, had to hunker scowling and uncomfortable on a low table,
listening to a barely audible reading in English by the very gentle and
soft-spoken Lee Harwood.  The remaining readings were in the pleasant,
modern Winstanley lecture hall.

(3) The French visitors to this conference must have viewed much of the
proceedings with bemused perplexity.  Philippe Beck, whose journal
‘Quaderno’ was feted, gamely sat through the whole thing (as did I).
With the exception of Michael Palmer, who is well known to be ‘sited’
within a Venn intersection of the two literatures, the anglophone and
francophone poets here might have come from different planets. There was
no public discussion of this yawning gap.  A panel discussion on this
point was sorely missed.  (Aside: Why is it that the major French
figures known in the English-speaking innovative world seem much less
interested in dense post-Steinian word-salad than some of their
anglophone counterparts?)

(4) This was a notably unfriendly and clannish (dare I say cliquish?)
small gathering (about 30 or so people most of the time). The only
people with any interest in talking to me, a nobody and an American,
when approached (with the exception of Peter Riley, a genuinely nice
chap) were not English: Vincent Ferre, Michael Palmer and Stephen
Rodefer.  There was a lot of shifty avoidance of eye contact and haughty
gliding or lounging about, even though we were closeted together.  So
much for human relations after the Poetry Revolution.  There was also a
somewhat laddish, old-boys-club, brilliant-amateur atmosphere to the
whole thing, despite the inclusion of a few women readers, which seemed
typically English to me.  The order of speakers kept having to be
rearranged, with a few substitutions as well.

The highlights (for me) were (in no particular order):  Michael Palmer,
Christian Prigent, and Michel Deguy, though there were many other
moments of interest.  A few panel discussions or presentations of papers
might have broken up the readings effectively and generated more public
discussions (of which there were none).

The readings (first impressions from sketchy notes):

Lee Harwood, an infinitely gentle, thin and slightly stooped figure,
opened the readings with some poems from his latest book, ‘Morning
Light’.  He mentioned that he’s worked as a museum guard, and invoked
the names of Anne Stevenson and Wordsworth in his inter-poem musings.
He makes small jabbing karate-chop gestures to accentuate the frequent
silence-beats between phrases, producing quietly staccato rhythms.  His
poems seem imagist, roughly, consisting of  sequences of  impressions
and thoughts, often anchored in a place, with sometimes just a little
too much explanation for the reader (like Wordsworth?)  Maybe a bit of a
New York school influence?  Not very pomo, certainly.  A curious choice
for the opening of this conference, I thought.

Next morning, Michael Ayres, a local Cambridge poet, began the day.  His
reading was quite moving, though again scarcely modernist let alone
pomo, being first-personal, elegiac and deeply mourning.  The first text
kept repeating, effectively, the phrase ‘a great calm descends’.  I was
reminded at first, at the level of the phrase unit, of du Bouchet, but
his (long) poems are constructed much more conventionally than du
Bouchet’s, so that likeness won’t really hold—he’s not afraid of a bit
of sententiousness, either.

He was immediately followed by Andy Johnson, a Cambridge graduate who
has spent some time in Africa.  Johnson is a much louder personality
than the first two readers, younger, eschewing the mic, and with the
bearing of a standup comedian.  He read short untitled poems, punchily
and with gusto.  They struck me as a bit wordy and baroque, in a sort of
English-bravura clever-clever LangPo manner.  One was a pastiche of
descriptions of an Etruscan tomb, sort of.  The ironic tone failed to
find any purchase—this coming after Ayres’s expression of personal loss
was almost offensive.

Stephen Rodefer read very briefly as a substitute for Andres Ajens,
whose English translations were still in preparation.  His manner was
offhand and funny.  There was a poem for Pierre Alferi.  I was intrigued
and wanted to hear more from him, but he wanted to go to lunch.

After lunch we had another oddly matched trio.  Ralph Hawkins began
working the crowd in good vaudevillian form.  He looks like a
middle-aged businessman, but often sports a boho erotic scatological
chinoiserie persona in his mostly comic poems, coming from a recent
Equipage booklet.  A sort of English blend of  Frank O’Hara, Gary Snyder
and Benny Hill.  The occasional snicker from the usually fairly
impassive audience.

Next up was the disarming Bob Walker, who caused some impatient
squirming with his very amateurish and breathy flute solo, with which he
opened the ‘set’.  He said this was the first reading he’d given in 25
years and that he shares an interest with Ralph Hawkins in Mallarme and
pigs.  His poems were lyrical and thoughtful, perhaps in a somewhat
discursive Poundian mode.  The conference notes state that he teaches
Japanese in the midlands, but he modestly depreciated his knowledge of
Asian languages, though he drew the characters of a haiku on the
blackboard for us, and explained the meaning of an ideograph on a
drinking mug: hara kiri.  He ended by sitting down at the piano and
singing, again amateurishly, a sort of Donovanesque Heraclitean blues.
Curiously, I found him a welcome break from the morning’s earlier
performing-Brit tone.

Allen Fisher, who was not scheduled, and who was introduced as ‘one of
the most important Cambridge poets of the last thirty years’, favoured
us with a quick reading in sepulchral tones of two of his recent
‘sonnets’, which sounded to me like much of the homophonic translation
I’ve read, so maybe that’s how they were produced.  They were studded
with terms from modern physics and astrophysics, as if pillaged from
Cambridge’s own Stephen Hawking, but betrayed no obvious understanding
of them.  He was dressed all in black, wore a very sour expression, and
has refined the Disdainful Donnish manner to perfection.

The four o’clock session brought a welcome pair of female voices.
Andrea Brady from Philadelphia, now resident in Cambridge as a
researcher in 17th century lit, was introduced as a very bright star on
the horizon.  I’m sorry to say that her work seemed callow to me, a
by-the-numbers post-LangPo exercise, so I won’t say any more about it.

Things finally began to come alive with Lisa Robertson’s reading.  Her
book ‘Debbie’ was described in the introduction as ‘one of the most
dazzlingly virtuosic texts of its epoch’ and maybe that was almost
deserved—I wanted to buy a copy, but they were sold out.  Her work
reminded me a little of Armantrout’s, somehow always hinting at the
sardonic, but more verbose and open.  She reads in a somewhat flat,
staccato but mesmerizing manner, constantly pulling you back into the
text almost in spite of yourself.  She seems capable of endless
speech-production without any need for a glass of water.  A long section
concerned the weather, with much parallelism and near-repetition in
construction and many I-sentences.  A high point.

Michael Palmer began the evening session, reading from a new MS, I
believe, called ‘Promises of Glass’.  I had heard him read in the
recording accompanying the ‘Exact Change Yearbook’, but had never seen
him in person before.  He is a more quietly spellbinding reader than
that recording would have led me to guess.  He also spoke
extemporaneously, with unaffected casual intelligence, about some of the
occasions of the poems he read, and it was interesting that what can
sound like very abstract linguistic meditative lyric is often occasioned
by or dedicated to a particular acquaintance or place, with affection.
One poem even contained some narrative bits.  Another made much play
with the phrase ‘the book of…’, and there were a lot of phrases with
formally opposed elements.  A real breath of fresh air in the day’s
proceedings, and a reading I won’t forget.

Thank God for the French.  Oscarine Bosquet was scheduled to read here,
but she was unable to owing to illness, and Philippe Beck filled in.  He
read a (prose?) meditation on Celan’s Meridian speech called ‘Meduse
automatique stoppee’, I think, which bears in on the figure of the
puppet/automaton/Pinocchio.  Kevin Nolan supplied the English, if I
recall.  Then he read some short poems intended for a woman’s voice, and
the English was handled by Andrea Brady.  Like some of Michel Deguy’s
work later, these were partly poems about poetry; at one point lineation
was called ‘bovine furrows’ and a phrase I jotted down was ‘…philosophy
is a closure without electric wires’.

Now came the apotheosis of the day’s earlier quirkiness, with a very
rare antipodean appearance by the exotic Australian creature Robert
Adamson, who has the manner of the last surviving individual of an
extinct species.  He was introduced as never having left Australia
before and as a good friend of Duncan and, latterly and epistolarily, of
Michael Palmer.  He lives on a river near Sydney, and his poems are
awash with piquant riverine flora and fauna which are the proximate
causes of unembarrassed old-fashioned epiphanies, as are the many
particular poets and singers enthusiastically mentioned in his lines,
including Hopkins, Larkin, Duncan, Les Murray, Bob Dylan and Emmylou
Harris.  Now this was a Bard.  There was a poem dedicated to Kinsella,
and one about Language Poetry called ‘Approaching Zukofsky’ that depicts
LangPo as an Aussie nature preserve: ‘we sang parrot…’.  What could the
French have made of this chipper but quaver-voiced apparition?

Next morning the rescheduled Andres Ajens, from Chile, read his polyglot
poems, which are mostly in Spanish and French.  A very soft shy voice,
and he refused to use the mic.  This work was in a familiar lyrical
South American mode, as far as I could tell, but possibly quite strong.
I think there was a Celan reference, ‘mit dem Sternwuerfel’, buried in
one.

Christophe Tarkos, who looks very much the young café poet, a bit
rumpled, stubbled and bleary-eyed, read his interesting faux-naif poems
next with a rather bored quick delivery.  They are long and associative,
though without a well-defined subjective voice, consisting of layered
short phrases and simple declarative sentences (too connected to be
called New Sentences) with a mock, spaced-out sententiousness, rather
like a lobotomized or Antin-ized Ponge.  One was a sustained collocation
of assertions about the appearance, behaviour and oblique sensuality of
small children and clouds, as if it were automatic writing at the park
bench.

Next another high point: Christian Prigent’s extraordinary performance.
A small, casually dressed but natty man sits down at the table, without
a microphone, squares up his papers before him with precise motions,
bends down over the papers to read, and …becomes *possessed*, chuffing
and wheezing, powerfully, like a locomotive/oracle, as if only this
rhythm can force the words out, attacking the language, inhabiting it,
gutting cliches, quoting, misquoting, ranting, climaxing and
decrescendoing, almost sobbing.  One piece focused on the word
‘orgasme’, another on ‘ma mere’.  This was a hard act to follow, so it
was good we broke for a musical interlude at this point.

The improvisational bass/cello/harp trio Simon Fell & IST did a set,
first pure music, then some collaborations with the poets.  We missed
the latter, opting for some fresh air, still digesting Prigent’s work.
The trio like to employ their stringed instruments strictly as
percussion instruments, and there was considerable virtuosity on
display.

The closing session in the evening took place again in the less than
ideal OCR, this time with chairs, and featured Michel Deguy, whose work
had been translated in collaboration with him during the preceding week
by three students, quite a privilege for them, and a very nice touch.
His work has a neoclassical, philosophically discursive quality that is
hard to assimilate on first hearing.  His voice is resonant and
beautiful, and he radiates a grand-old-man dignity (Discourse of
Authority!).  Again, some panel discussion here of his place in French
letters would have been nice.

Erin Moure had the perhaps unenviable task of closing the proceedings,
which she did with great aplomb.  She has her own confident standup
manner, the book drooping insouciantly from her hand like a cigarette
from Keith Richard’s mouth, reading quickly in spurts and pausing to
look at the audience like a comedian, sometimes veering into French
without blinking an eye. Her work is chatty and eclectic, swooping from
formal to informal, sharp, funny, ranging over a wide field
perceptually, emotionally, politically and intellectually.  Peter Riley
made the telling comment introducing her that while she is modestly
feted in Canada, in England she would still be publishing in mimeograph.

Despite my various cavils, I would like to thank the organizers,
especially Peter Riley, for putting together an (at least sometimes)
very stimulating and certainly various show, and the poets for having
the guts to get up there and read.

Private Donors Unite to Support Art Spurned by the Government


By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

Nearly two dozen foundations and philanthropists, reacting to cuts in
federal arts spending, have joined forces to support artists who challenge
convention. The new group will attempt to make up for some of the individual
grants the federal government ended in 1994 after years of controversy over
works dealing with nudity, sexuality and other provocative themes.

The new nonprofit organization, called Creative Capital Foundation, will be
announced officially next week. But it has already made it clear that it
will not shy away from the kind of innovative art that incited protests by
religious and political conservatives.

"This is a boisterous, diverse country, and we have always had art that
upsets people," said Archibald L. Gillies, president of the Andy Warhol
Foundation for the Visual Arts and one of the new group's organizers.
"Controversy," he added, "won't bother us at all."

Creative Capital hopes to raise $40 million over the next 20 years. With
current assets of more than $5 million, it plans to make its first round of
grants, totaling up to $1 million, early next year.

The organization will actively proselytize for freedom of expression. The
grants it plans to give each year to 50 to 60 artists will requiring the
winners to work with experts to develop audiences for their art and to
market it.

At its peak in the late 1980s the National Endowment for the Arts awarded as
much as $10.5 million a year to more than 750 individual artists in grants
of $1,100 to $45,000. But since then the endowment has almost been
eliminated several times by members of Congress upset by those grants and by
what they said was the agency's distance from American values. It has
survived, but with a budget cut nearly in half from its peak to $98 million
in the current fiscal year and no appetite to make awards that would restart
the cultural wars of the last decade.

Creative Capital is stepping into that breach. "The Supreme Court has ruled
about pornography, but anything beyond that is fair game," Gillies said. "In
this organization's absolute principles, one comes first and that is funding
experimental, challenging art on its merits. Then after selecting it, we see
what the marketing potential is. The nature of the content is not a factor."

With such talk, Creative Capital is throwing down the gauntlet to
conservatives who in recent years have tried to shut down some exhibitions
and performances. Though the fights have most often been about public
financing of controversial art, mainly by the endowment, some conflicts have
also centered on state and local arts grants and the commercial availability
of provocative art.

The president of the Christian Coalition, Randy Tate, said on learning on
Friday of the new group: "I won't condemn anything until I see it, but I
would hope they use great discretion and put forward images that strengthen
society and family values."

The group's grants come with a twist straight out of Wall Street and
reflecting the business background of some backers (like Jeffrey Soros,
nephew of George Soros, the billionaire financier). Grant winners must agree
to share a portion of proceeds from their project. The cash will go back
into Creative Capital's kitty, increasing its capacity to finance additional
artists.

The Warhol Foundation, with a pledge to give $400,000 a year for the next
three years, is Creative Capital's largest contributor. Others, including
the Norton Family Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Joe and Emily
Lowe Foundation, the Joyce Mertz-Gilmore Foundation and the Eli Broad Family
Foundation, have each promised up to $100,000 a year.

Creative Capital's executive director, Ruby Lerner, said contributors knew
that the group would seek out and not shrink from artists like Karen Finley,
who often performs in the nude and famously smears her body in chocolate;
Robert Mapplethorpe, whose homoerotic photographs offended many, and other
artists who caused headline-making conflicts.

Ms. Lerner said she told the contributors, "We might get through the first
20 years and not have a single controversy, but we might have 50 of them in
the first year."

Creative Capital plans to award grants of $5,000 to $20,000 to performing,
visual and film or video artists, as well as those who make hybrid works.
The money will be split roughly equally among the four categories each year.

In the hope that the culture wars are over, William J. Ivey, the national
endowment's new director, has put in a $150 million budget request for the
next fiscal year, up $52 million from the endowment's current allocation,
and has raised the possibility of resuming individual grants. But he has
made no promises about when that might happen.

Supporters of the arts say they cannot wait. "The arts are filled with
energy, yet sources of public finance are more and more precarious," said
Catharine R. Stimpson, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at
New York University. "The important issue is supporting creativity."

Ms. Stimpson has agreed to serve on Creative Capital's board, as have Laurie
Anderson, the performance artist; Lewis Hyde, the writer; Ronald Feldman, a
New York art dealer, and Louise A. Velazquez, a senior business adviser at
the Interval Research Corp., a Silicon Valley company that is trying to
engage the arts and high-tech in new ventures.

As the first big, national response to cuts in endowment grants, Creative
Capital could make a difference. But he and others agree that an equally
important effect may stem from the attempt to enlarge the audience for
contemporary art. "Whenever individuals engage art and artists in a personal
way with good interpretation and explanation, it always expands the
audience," Ivey said.

Gillies described the process that Creative Capital's founders envisioned as
broader than marketing. "We will ask, 'What does this project need to
succeed, what does an artist need to get to the next level?"' he said.

Artists will get individual advice from an array of volunteer curators,
producers, publicity agents and others who can help artists devise a plan to
present their work to the widest possible audience.

That plan helped woo contributors. "Emerging artists get a lot of one-time
cash awards, but this affords them something else," said Dini S. Merz, a
program officer at the Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation, which is giving
$300,000 over four years. "It will answer the question 'How can we help
artists help themselves?"'

But will artists agree to such interference, and an untested idea at that?
Yong Soon Min, a Korean-born artist who lives in California and is known for
politically charged, feminist work, said she had no problems with it. "A
marketing plan can be very helpful," she said. Rather, her concerns centered
on Creative Capital's administrative ability to deliver on the promise.

Creative Capital has had with artists around the country not a single one
has raised objections.

The revenue-sharing requirements apparently did not disturb anyone either,
though the details are sketchy. Ms. Lerner said they would be worked out
individually with each grant agreement, and Gillies said Creative Capital
would probably ask for 10 to 15 percent of a project's gross revenues.
Creative Capital would also have a cut if, say, a film, video or performance
moved from a nonprofit space to a commercial theater, as the musical "Rent"
did, for example.

The group has other plans to shore up the nation's artistic infrastructure:
an annual retreat for grant recipients, a quarterly publication, a database
of arts businesses and nonprofit groups, public events and a Web site where
artists can sell their art.

All that is in the future. Creative Capital, with its small staff, first has
to hustle to erect a structure for doling out money. Ms. Lerner is sending
staff members into studios, theaters and other arts centers looking for
prospects, is soliciting nominations from arts experts and on July 1 will
start accepting applications from artists.

Those who make the initial cut will be asked for work samples, a detailed
budget for their project and a schedule. The applications will go through a
peer panel review process, with the winners chosen or approved by the
trustees.

Ideology aside, Gillies said the winners would have projects that have
artistic merit, not simply shock value.

"It's not that we'll support everything controversial," he said. "We will
support what people across the country are saying is good art, is exciting,
interesting art."

*** Fabio rests after bird accident

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - Fabio was resting at home after being
smacked in the face by a goose while riding a roller coaster at the
Busch Gardens theme park. "I am grateful for all the cards and well
wishes," the supermodel said in a statement issued Thursday through
his manager, Eric Ashenberg. Fabio was at the Virginia theme park
Tuesday to help show off the Apollo's Chariot roller coaster. The
park had promoted the event as "Modern-Day 'Adonis' vs. Ancient-Day
'Sun God.'" Early into the ride, a bird slammed into his face. Fabio
was treated for a one-inch cut on the bridge of his nose and released
from a hospital. See

Dear Listmates:

I'll be giving a talk at the "Poetry and Pedagogy" symposium at Bard in
late June, and am planning to talk about poems that respond to or come out
of a pedagogical situation or that take a pedagogical stance.  Taking off
from the aphorism in *My Life* that "the avant-garde is always
pedagogical," my focus will be mainly--but not exclusively--on
linguistically innovative (or whatever you want to call 'em) texts.
Historical range is post-World War II, going from 1950s examples like
Snodgrass' "April Inventory" and Olson's "Letter for Melville 1951"
through something like Snyder's "What you should know to be a Poet" up
through some of Howe's library- and scholarship-centered texts and
Perelman's "Marginalization of Poetry."  The governing question of the
inquiry is something like this, then: How has "pedagogy," and pedagogical
institutions, been treated in poems of this period, and what
might the answers
to that question suggest for transforming current pedagogical practice,
for the teaching of challenging contemporary work, and for our
understanding of such issues as the relationship between innovative
writing and the academy?

I'd like to draw on your collective knowledge / wisdom to generate as many
examples as possible of poems related to this set of concerns.  I'm mostly
interested in U.S. examples, but would also like to hear about Canadian,
British, Oz, etc. examples too.  I want to distinguish between
"pedagogical" and "didactic" too, so am a bit less interested in examples
of the latter (i.e., Olson preaching to Gloucester, say).

Anyway, I'd much appreciate hearing from you: front channel if you think
the list would be interested and the list-meisters agree, or backchannel
at one of these addresses: acgold01@athena.louisville.edu or
agolding1@aol.com.

And many thanks.

All best,

Alan

THANKSGIVING DAY

and ran in the corner store
and asked him for the bus fare
and he give me the money and a pack of cigarettes

Thanksgiving day was here
this day free to many ways
to make me strong just as Job's story told

when you coming back to pay the dope man
all the while sink more and more into a deep black hole
went right back to what I had come to know

and hated the money and candy stuck and stayed
they understood I was decided in every declaration
Nathaniel, Ezra and Timothy, Mr Bush at the Corner Store
Howard the Numbers Man, Mr Crenshaw in the corner store
he forced my head against him in his mouth

come over and get high, smoke weed, drink pink champagne
who would feel the wrath of me next
loose in a great big city running wild
break the hold that hold he reached down
in his back pocket and pulled out his 38

Cornerstore man
have some pussy for credit
basement of his building

get a hold of bad dope
fevered from the abcesses
I used up all my veins
cigarettes and dope in the window
stick it through the window

say gone, or high, I wasn't anything
a syringe full of cocaine
scrutiny, urine, and buy
my double cheeseburgers
large strawberry milkshake
and large french fries

she had a Bar-B-Q
three quarter house
for us a house together
up into late house

ripping in that
take away me right
real, and I loved and I loved myself
just for that day

show me absolutely No
never not for any reason
I didn't ask for nor wanted

we went to the landlord house
with this book rewrite a book
and I drove like a bat out of hell
talk with them and calm them down
costumed to take residence over everything

there I met a real live dope man
and he shot me up at the same time
heroin and cocaine and serene and nothing
mattered anymore play and night more
and just pick up one and we didn't get or have

we had a jailhouse marriage that summer
and that my mother's father was killed in the coal mines
she said to me I'm going to teach you the songs
we used to sing way down in the back hills of Birmingham

never in my visioned thoughts
pondered, many reasons beat at
annullable, the damage was done
with them to think all alone about how

forsake them many people who knew me
the only exscape I had from my grip
my lifeline during that time
or while I was sucking dick

drunk jumped in my face calling me names
and comes out with her pistol
cocked it and shot it in the air

Thanksgiving day was here
this day free to many ways
to make me strong just as Job's story told

I walked out barefoot and it was winter
there was plenty snow on the ground

and I walked from 79th and Wade Park
to 74th and Quincy in the snow

I'm trying a online experiment--putting an issue of Witz on the website in
Acrobat format (http://www.litpress.com/witz). This is a complete issue
(Summer 1998), formatted for print publication. It has Peter Quartermain's
essay on Bruce Andrews's _Lip Service_, Juliana Spahr on Nick Piombino's
_Light Street_, Guy Bennett on Liz Waldner, Standard Schaefer on Martha
Ronk, and Brian Lucas on Normal Cole.

To read this electronic version, you will need the Adobe Acrobat reader. If
you don't have the Reader, you can find it at Adobe's website (there's a
link on the Witz page). But the Reader is a long download (I think it's
around 5MG), so I don't really recommend getting the software just for this
purpose. Many of you will already have the Reader, though; and many have
already downloaded something in Acrobat format.

If you do download the file, I would appreciate a note (backchannel), to let
me know if you had any technical problems (e-address is
creiner@litpress.com).

If this works, I'll put more issues up in electronic format.

(By the way,, Witz is a journal of contemporary poetics, featuring *only*
essays, reviews and criticism. Online queries are accepted, but not
submissions.)

hi alan!  of course i think first of Stein's "How to Write," and her
children's book that starts, "A dog said he was going to learn to read."
and to one (picasso?) that ends "history teaches/ history teaches." stein,
it seems, is all about pedagogy.  My Life, too, seems full of lessons about
how to read it.  Rimbaud's Voyelles (sp?) seems like a very poetic ABCdary
of a sort, and Baudelaire's "COrrespondances" seems to be about how to read
as well.  In Lois Ann Yamanaka's Saturday Night at the Pahala Theatre,
there's a poem in which one teenaged friend teaches another how to
self-mutilate by cutting, which seems to me to be a writing lesson as well,
a poetics of pain.  then speaking of writing lessons, there's Derrida's
famous writing lesson in Of Grammatology, which isn't strictly speaking a
poem, but could just as well be.  ditto for Foucault's "The Discourse on
Language."  gee i didn't know i had so much to say about this, but it
actually sounds like the good basis for a poetry course!  see u at bard...

Steve Waksman, a former student of mine, e-mailed the following, which i
know to be of interest to some on the list. keep an eye out, too, for
Waksman's book, coming out in the late fall from Harvard UP: Instruments of
Desire, which is a cultural history of the electric guitar.

SW: I came across this while leafing through a collection of movie notes by
Jonas Mekas, one of the main organizers of the "independent" film scene in
New York from the 1940s to the present.  Assuming it's the same Hannah
Weiner you wrote about.  Did you know she made films (or at least, a film)?
This is dated April 30, 1970:

Foot, by Hannah Weiner.  Three minutes. Eight mm.  Shown by Gain Ground
Group, Thursday, April 23, at 80 Wooster Street.  Autumn colors.  Woods.  A
glimpse of one foot, then another.  A foot coming into the frame and out,
again into the frame and again out -- as someone walks through the woods.
Only the front half of the shoe, a sandal of some sort, light blue and
white, in the overexposed color.  A perfect haiku.  A film haiku, a short,
one idea, or one image film.  This silly, unpretentious little 8 mm. movie
by Hannah Weiner is a much more important and more successful and more
beautiful and more memorable work of film art than, say, The Man Who Lies,
Mississippi Mermaid, or The Early Works.  People will say:  How can you
compare them?  One is an 8 mm. nothing, and the others are big movies.
Grillet, Truffaut failed within their genre, within their form; Weiner
succeeded, didn't fail, within her genre, within her form.  Through Hannah
Weiner's little movie one gains an aesthetic experience; through the others
one gains nothing.  In art, it doesn't make a bit of difference how big the
undertaking:  A failure is a failure.  Hannah Weiner's Foot is the best
movie I've seen since Ozu's I Was Born, But...

Generations


Of the beat generation, I'm, of Keruac's roadtrips, Ginsborg's screams
Of the lost generation, of language's blank eyes & heartless suns
My generation's smeared across the void
My generation's crossed with yours, X's, Y's, wise Z's & Zeros too
Of the punk generation, anger's energetic PILs & Gang of Four Humans
Of the yippies, yr violent letters of revolution & Jennifer-fervor
Of the cyborg generation, I'm, of Jennifer's sweet & sweaty arms
Of the cyborgs, @create $thing called Alan @describe Alan as gone-world
& of the holocaust generation, I'm, just look into my eyes
Of the generation of Mariko Mori, hey Nikuko, I'm yours forever
And of the gone-world, I'm, a generation of $things from #1 roots
Of the hippies, I'm all for long lean sounds backing my heavy head
Of my family's generations, I'm, crawled through European savagries
only to emerge with blank generation's eyes crossed X's out & lost
You'll find me everywhere, submerged in your hot worlds
I swallow your generations, make them mine, nothing out of line
Generations on generations, onto the seventh & beyond
Generations of humans & others, generations of plants & biospheres
Generations of rocks & prions, generations of airs & liquid canyons
I'm there in anything you can name, any place & any time
Of the blank, I'm, saying, blank, saying crossed out, saying wow

Life/Forms:
New Ways to See It, New Ways to Say It

A weekend "residency" with Bill Berkson

Friday, May 7, 7:30 p.m.
Reading with Michael Friedman
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street

Saturday, May 8, 7:30 p.m.
Autobiographical Talk: "Since When"
New College Cultural Center
766 Valencia Street
$5

"Special care is language, and fusing things going on in him and on his
personal tv." So wrote Ted Berrigan in Kulchur magazine about BILL
BERKSON's first book, Saturday Night: Poems 1960-61. Berkson's trajectory
has led him from youth along uptown Manhattan's Museum Mile to ecstasies on
the Lower East Side, onward to the Bolinas mesa (where he edited Big Sky
magazine and books), and from there to the upper reaches of Noe Valley,
S.F. Other books strewn along the way: Shining Leaves, Recent Visitors,
Enigma Variations with drawings by Philip Guston, Blue Is The Hero, Start
Over and Lush Life. Besides occupying a stellar niche in contemporary
American poetry, he is an art critic, sometime curator, and, since 1984,
professor of art history at the San Francisco Art Institute. For this
residency, Bill Berkson will read poetry from his forthcoming book Fugue
State (1990-99) and the full text of a revealing and often humorous
autobiographical essay entitled "Since When."

MICHAEL FRIEDMAN grew up in New York City and now lives in Denver. His
books include Arts & Letters (drawings by Duncan Hannah) (The Figures,
1996), Cameo (The Figures, 1994), Special Capacity (Intermezzo, 1992),
Distinctive Belt (Mary House, 1985). Hard Press/The Figures will publish a
large collection of his prose poems in the fall. He has edited Shiny
Magazine since 1986, bringing out 8 issues between 1986 and 1992. Now,
after a long hiatus, and with a somewhat different cast of characters, a
new, guest-edited issue has appeared and he plans to continue this work.
"There are two sides to every story," Friedman reminds us. "One well done,
one medium rare." His own poetry is drenched in wit, and brio; its
narrative mysteriously tangled with anxiety and alterity. A natural
melancholia attaches itself to the underside of the poem, like Kate Winslet
going back onto the Titanic after Leo's made sure she's safe in the
lifeboat.

There are of course Nick Piombino's wonderful parodies of the
pedagogical/academic explication of poetry  in _The Gertrude Stein Awards
in Innovative American Poetry_ --  I think the 93-94 volume; they're the
lead-off poems.

OOPS (the title of the first book, published by Dave Baratier)!
The Printer at HARD PRESS had some problem with the lamination on
the cover when the book was being bound.....

so....

the thursday night event at TRANS HUDSON
(416 west 13th st., meatpacking manhattan)
will not
       be a book signing after all

just a plain old reading

     by a so-called "cynical"
          poet who cried wolf

come as you are....

Hi. below is a message from derek beaulieu, to the multiple
recipients of his most recent message (including the list).
I'm putting it up because I thought it might serve as a
cautionary tale to list subscribers; however, I want to be
absolutely clear that

  the infected message to which derek refers did NOT reach
  the list - I found and deleted it.

Therefore, while this message is of interest as Happy99.exe
and similar worms/viruses continue to cause havoc in personal
mail and especially on listservs,

  there is NO threat of infection from any message that has
  been sent over the poetics list.

For futher information on Happy99.exe and other viruses,
I recommend you refer to the following sites:

SARC's Virus Encyclopedia
<http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/vinfodb.html>

Subject: DO NOT OPEN HAPPY99.EXE very sorry - virus warning
Date: Tue, 4 May 1999 23:21:28 -0600

I would like to apologise, as my last email, unbeknownst to me had a virus
attached to it. the virus was called happy99.exe and here are the
instructions to rid yourself of this virus:

1.check the WINDOWS\SYSTEM folder for the presence of these files:
    SKA.EXE
    SKA.DLL
    WSOCK32.SKA
2.if you do find these files, then you have been attacked by the happy99
virus, and remove it by doing this:
1. delete SKA.EXE, SKA.DLL and WSOCK32.DLL
2. rename WSOCK32.SKA as WSOCK32.DLL
make sure that you have WSOCK32.SKA file before deleting WSOCK32.DLL and
ensure that you have renamed this file correctly. you may have to close your
browser, email software, etc

to delete and rename the DLL files (you may have to shutdown WINDOWS and
restart in dos mode)
1. shutdown windows with the RESTART IN MS-DOS MODE option.
2. at the prompt type CD SYSTEM (return)
                                    DEL WSOCK32.DLL (return)
                                    REN WSOCK32.SKA WSOCK23.DLL
and now restart your computer
open the c:\\windows\system\liste.ska in your NOTEPAD to see a list of who
you may have infected yourself.

once again - I apologise, I have now reloaded a virus checker - operating
without one was unprofessional and unnecessarily risky and once again I am
very sorry for the bother,
problems and trouble this has created for you all.
yours very sincerely
derek beaulieu

Big thanks to Randolph for his Cork(ers). My spare liver came home on the
plane in a bag and has now been resituated successfully, acting as a bilge
pump to our garden pond. An instance of 'we' I'm happy to sanction.

I wanted to say up here on the big public spaces how energising the Cork
Conference was / is. Sure, it rained a drop. Trevor Joyce's house
overflowed with hospitalities. Nourishments ranged from the Cafe Paradiso
to AbraKebabRa.

But (not despite but due and thanks to that) -  the poetry and the poetics
was sound the way through; extremely strong readings, provocative papers,
buoyant exchanges. Anybody with half a mind to go next year (and I believe
there will be a next year) should put it into their priority commitment
calendar on the front-burner right now.

Modesty forbade Randolph from commenting on his own reading, so I'd like to
add to his otherwise generous account that, despite two cracked ribs and a
savagely bitten tongue, he gave a terrific presentation of the
anagrammatically encrypted 'The Republic of Ireland' (itself taxing the
ribs of those present), various excerpts from '25 Poems', 'Flame' and the
chilling closing section of his more recent 'Scales' that leaves only the
word 'whereas' proud of dense blocks of erasure on what I understand to be
the United Nations Charter. I'm left still wondering in what ways to
transact 'Satin Mac In Sale' to the coastline and its offshore reaches
below the walkable twists of Cork City itself.

many thanks and greetings to all

love and love
cris

 Greetings from [sic]

 May 1st rolled around and lo and behold [sic] managed to update, so far so
good. This issue has four new features, including work by derek beaulieu,
Neil Hennessy, Thomas Bell/Dmitri Bulatov, and myself/Scott Woods. Also new
this month is an early version of the Small Press Directory, with press

Subject:      Final reading at the Ruthless Grip Art Project in D.C.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        We hope you can join us in D.C. at the Ruthless Grip Art Project
(1508 U  St. NW, on U near the corner of 15th, just above ATTICUS BOOKS)
on Saturday, May 8 at 7:30 p.m. for a poetry reading by PHYLLIS
ROSENZWEIG, CATHY WAGNER, and MARTIN CORLESS-SMITH.

        Sadly, this is the last ever poetry event at the Ruthless Grip Art
Project, where I've been hosting readings since fall 1995. We'll be
continuing next fall in a new location, but for now, come on out and enjoy
the last great evening of poetry we're going to have in a location that's
meant a great deal to many of us. The evening will also be a chance to say
thanks to our fine hosts of so many years, Ann and Harry Wallace.


        PHYLLIS ROSENZWEIG is the author of DOGS (Edge Books) and the
co-editor along with Diane Ward of the poetry magazine/project PRIMARY
WRITING. One of D.C.'s best kept secrets, she writes a poetry of stunning
range and knowledge--you won't want to miss this rare chance to hear her.


        CATHY WAGNER is the author of MAGAZINE POEMS. Her work has also
appeared in SITUATION, FENCE, RIBOT, THE DENVER QUARTERLY, and THE CHICAGO
REVIEW, among other magazines. If you don't know her lively and wry work
yet, you certainly will later, so why not just do it now?


        British poet MARTIN CORLESS-SMITH has lived in Nevada for the last
several years--go figure. His book OF PISCATOR was published by University
of Georgia Press; Spetacular Books has also just released his THE GARDEN:
A THEOPHANT OR ECCOHOME A DIALECTICAL LYRIC. Corless-Smith seems one of
the most exciting new inheritors of the British Objectivist tradition;
echoes of Basil Bunting and others combine with an absolutely comtemporary
twist of language and environment that is sounded as precisely as any work
around.

        We hope you'll join us for this evening of poetry and all
festivities afterwards.

The Political Economy of Bombs as Transparencies


Nikuko writes and wrongs, clearly we are entering a new age, occasioned
first by the harbinger of anarchists' cookbooks, not to mention Loompan-
ics, the whole wide world of Net, ready availability of household chemi-
cals. This is the world of the reign and rain of bombs, the porousness of
everyday life, fearful no longer of tiny-tot handguns, but the potential
for any place and any time to explode with nails, glass, strips of tin,
shrapnel beyond experimental poetics.

Think of bomb-blast winds carrying fires and debris everywhere; imagine
your own limbs incinerated, cut apart: look around you as walls and ceil-
ings fall through charred floors. A violent wind blows across the planet
as volatile mixtures from uranium to nitro rise from the interior in order
to be packaged in pipes and bottles, cars and trucks, airplanes and trains
- packaged in anything transportable - anything of the nature of _vector._

Because, adds Jennifer, first there is the _vector,_ and then there is the
emission or spew - the dissipation of materials after chemical or nuclear
reaction - as the earth returns mixtures to its own, returning, in fact,
the whole of civilization to the condition of the _brew._ Just as there is
a tendency towards _distinction_ - for example, the very computer I am ty-
ping on appears as an ordered coalescence of minerals and metals and other
elements of the world - there is also a tendency towards _substance,_ that
aphanisis or loss of distinction characteristic of our primordial begin-
nings. Call this the death drive or error, but we now may observe our pla-
netary surface within the throes of two regimes at odds - that of inscrip-
tion or distinction, and that of the fissuring of entities through bombs.

Julu chimes in, and this porousness will increase; biological weapons are
a short step behind. Soon, anyone, anywhere, will be able to make himself
or herself felt among the remnants of culture and civilization - ideas
will flourish according to an economy of detonations and silent killers.
That woman next to you may be carrying anthrax; that man across the street
hides grenades in his briefcase; those children run plastique for the drug
runners. These things are the orders of the day; the new political economy
is built upon the necessary destruction of the old. No matter that the
final result is planetary toxicity - that is at least decades away.

Jennifer says, we draw our circles in the sand. Nikuko says, within the
circles is our band. Julu says, the circles consecrate our land. All
three, then speaking together, the circles constitute our land. & they are
silent & watch the rising wind. & they do not see the wind, but only the
effects of the wind. & Nikuko says, we have been given this transparency.

- Harold, thanks for your field report on CCCP, your social
anthropology degree's in the post. In particular, thanks for your
crediting of Peter Riley and the Organisers - as one who's done his
share of organising, I know what's involved, and how little thanks one
gets. But I'm afraid I can't explain the cultural politics of the
presences / absences: you're surely not suggesting some kind of
divisions in the camp of Britpo are you? How could you? We're just one
big happy family...

I suspect in most cases the reasons would turn out to be simply a
matter of Having Other Fish To Fry. There was, for instance, an
excellent conference going on at the same time in Cork, and late April
is a good time to catch up on family things, which is what I was
doing, and perhaps others too.=20

I think the "international" elements of CCCP are great: we're still
caricatured - with some justification, perhaps - as an insular, not to
say village, bunch, and any evidence to the contrary is welcome.

          curious I should think of any of this      as meaning
more than itself
     I don't like to associate myself w/ things meaning more than
themselves     at the same time I feel there are some secrets left
unreported

I still hold to my earlier thesis

flirting is perhaps the best example but also talking to a boss
                                               state intervention
is the most prevalent tactic & actually it indicates a degree to
which vestiges of democracy
          remain active in an idealized 'fascist'
                                            the dichotomy between
wilderness & urban life
          resists the lower class by situating neigborhoods

outside the limits of municipal retaliation & response

occasionally he gets messages from classmates most of whom appear
from their voices to be polish
                                as well

A monumental petrol stop by the track-side 10 million snacks
all conflated one hell of a mess here, better to run

through the options vote in some order of sun beam
bonded by overt minimized distraction

to its chorelessness lighting the repute outpost by the kitchenette window
seen
through which crows and goats squirm, not themselves

apprehended as with number one strict darkly beheld
contrariness but likewise they're threatened and getting so, so tired

of just this, sieved joy / once or twice again / glo in
the dark esteem piled beneath each chance-stop like a grin-voucher.

Just rec'd from 24 Hour Press:

     FAULT LINE PARK by Brian Young

This is a strong little (actually 29 closely-printed pages) chapbook,
and comes highly recommended. Quickly:

Owning its connection to the NY School of Schulyer or the thin
surrealism of James Wright, FAULT LINE PARK turns those more static
or "restful" elements to restive account in a linguistic play that
ranges from them into humorous cynicism and underlying despair -
as in this, what seems almost direct address to the foregoing:

     My God, what is it now? I know it can't be
     all that important. You balanced the irresistible
     flames in the thought of a few birds,
     the makeshift eyeball, and the ceremonial screech
     of a reverse sky. They are all out there right now,
     they are asking you to delete this, for Christ's sake.

These poems are by turns aggressive and aggressively self-critical,
speculative and disappointed, cruelly frank and frankly beautiful.
Continuing the quotation:

                                        They are made whole by the piano, played in the drugstore.
     I know that nearly anything could serve as a purpose
                                        in your life now. In the arbitrary connections
     of the late afternoon, without a radiating hedge
     to dream by.



Argh - that's all the review I have time for, have to run.

     Chris

Here is something a few of my colleagues (anthropology, development
office, math, political science--an interdisciplinary effort) cooked up
(at happy hour, I think) for something to do this summer in small town
Virginia--besides re-enact battles from the War of Northern Aggression.
If this is OK for the list, please post it.

Dear everyone:

We would like to invite you to participate in an informal experiment
about Americans' impressions of our national identity.  It works like
this:  list 50 material objects that represent your own personal vision
of American social and/or political culture.  The items on your list
should be physical objects, but fairly general; e.g. "a '57 chevy", and
not "my grandmother's blue and green '57 chevy with that dent on the
left
front fender".  The items don't have to be this specific either, "a car"

would be perfectly acceptable.  Other possible categories are: icons,
buildings, clothing; any kind of material item, of any size whatsoever.
Imagine that you are putting together a museum exhibit to show others
how
you view American society.

You can list your items in any order, as we will not be considering any
kind of ranking.

If we get a significant response,  our plan is to analyze the lists for
overlap, in order to see what kind of agreement people have on how our
society should be represented.  We'll send a copy of the results to
everyone who participates, and we will be accepting responses
indefinitely.

Please feel free to respond anonymously, but it would be useful for us
to
know the following information:

a) your sex.
b) your approximate age (to within 5 years, e.g. 10-15,...,80-85, etc.)
c) where you live
d) of which country you are a citizen
e) the racial or ethnic group with which you identify
f) political identification, if any (a short description rather than a
party name is fine)

This experiment is not limited to Mary Baldwin College.  Please forward
this message to everyone whom you think might be interested.  If you
would
like to help analyze the data, please volunteer.

Send responses and/or inquiries to

ariskin@mbc.edu

Please do not change the subject line of your response, and please let
us know
if you would like updates on the progress of the survey.

Thanks,

TamTam Books & Beyond Baroque presents
with the support of the French Cultural Service in Los Angles

 Serge Gainsbourg and Boris Vian Party

                Saturday May 15 at 7:30 P.M.
                AT: Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center
                        681 Venice Blvd
                        Venice, CA 90291

                        TamTam Books:    323-661-8741

         Tosh Berman and his TamTam Books celebrates the release of their
first two titles: Boris Vian's I Spit on Your Graves  and Serge
Gainsbourg's only novel Evgu=E9nie Sokolov.  Both titles were, and still are
shocking in its sense of outrageousness provocation, and brilliance.  Vian
was a jazz musician, playwright, novelist, translator of hard boiled
American crime classics (Chandler, Cain, etc.) into French, and hardcore
trouble maker.  Gainsbourg was a  prototype lusty punk who tore into the
threads of French society with his numerous films, music projects, and
outlandish persona.     Both of them changed the world, and therefore
transformed the world of pop music and literature into a vision of
sexuality , humor and of course danger.

        Along with the readings of Gainsbourg and Vian's work we feature
the glorious sounds of dj's Lance Rock & Hypnotique spinning the sounds of
Vian & Gainsbourg and the French music revolution they both started, and a
screening of the ultra-rare documentary on Gainsbourg in English, with the
tantalizing Brigitte Bardot,  the desirable Jane Birkin, and of course, the
nasty overtones of "Lemon Incest" with Gainsbourg's  daughter Charlotte.

Tickets are $7. $5 for students and seniors.  Beyond Baroque members free.

Boris Vian's I Spit on Your Graves & Serge Gainsbourg's Evgu=E9nie Sokolov
are available on Amazon.com, Barnes & Nobel.com and various bookstores.

I'll always treasure the memory of Peter Quartermain, fresh back from his
retirement party, reading his goodbye speech in his kitchen while Alice and I
were on a visit to Vancouver and its fine poetry circles there.  It made the
day light up.

TEEN TELEPOETIC RECITAL - 2-way video linked poetry performances by
young poets.

             "... culture and kids come together in interesting ways,
all
             made possible by new media. On 29 May, graduating high-
             school students from two distant literary programs, one
             in Chicago and the other in Vancouver, will host a shared
             recital linked by videophone. The event is special because
not
             only do the students perform their own original work, and
             thus get some leverage on each other's cultures, but
they'll
             also be behind the media, exerting their prerogative of
             self-representation.

             If past years are any indication, the quality of the
writing will
             be quite high, often way better than the poetry one hears
at
             open mikes and many high-profile readings. Usually they
             break into a spontaneous Q&A at the end of the recital, and

             begin asking each other why they write and perform the way
             they do.

             It's quite a moment to see that light of awareness switch
on,
             as the kids realize they are speaking from different
cultures
             and somewhat different literary traditions.

             ... guests are invited to see the videoconference in person
in
             either Chicago or Vancouver, but should call ahead for
             details. In Chicago, the event is free. We will not netcast
this
             videoconference, so attending in person is the only way to
             join the audience...."*

Kristen Gallagher put up a notice on Josh Schuster's odd and
brilliant first book the other day. I thought I'd go ahead and share
some jottings I'd been doing on it, stream-of-consciousness as they
be.

_Project Experience: Museums, Archives, Monuments,
Bureaus_, by Joshua Schuster [Philadelphia: Handwritten Press, 1999]
(order: Kristen Gallagher, 3805 Locust Walk, Philadelphia, PA 19104)


                                                --"The archive is an ear."

Fifty pages, bound in the shape of a blue passport from the State of
Approval, as the cover has it. Kristen Gallagher, currently of the U.
of Pennsylvania Writer's House and soon of SUNY/Buffalo, has curated
these documents, handed to her by one Joshua Schuster. May her
Handwritten Press make as many beautiful, passport-sized books as
there are countries in the world.

Is this Schuster's passport into our State or our passport into his?

Scripted question. But it's not clear who is speaking. The Museums
and Archives, Monuments and Bureaus, in a kind of Foucauldian play on
the pathetic fallacy, speak at us, though sometimes, too, an "I"
interrupts, and sometimes a kind of narrator, like the guide on the
headset in the museum or like a person talking to himself. But this
confusion of authority is part the point, isn't it, for it's much of
the truth of our current state. Our Institutions _do_ speak, are
outside and inside us at the same moment, and when we speak we speak
them and they speak us. Thus who is listening as a question we
need to listen to. Scripted sentence. Boring Belgrade rubble replaced
by grieving American students. F-16's in formation, majestic over
teacher's funeral. Commercial for Lockheed, joyous child holding
paper airplane aloft. Let us pray. Must teach Our children that
violence is not the answer, says teary President inside of us, making
heads nod. How surprising to the refugee when she sees the saplings
shiver their leaves inside the transparent torso of the border guard.
Now give me your archives and go to NATO, he says, if you love them
so much. On page 27:

You are the sum of your storages: organs
of memory, organs of the morning, organs
of waiting, organs of identity. To tend the
archive is a kind of organology.

A bit Jabes in its aphoristic proceeding, a bit Popa in its mythic
charge, a bit Simic in its cobbling of surreal miniatures, a bit
Palmer in its hieratic namings, a bit Museum of Jurassic
Technology--the whole book--in its wunderkammer (sp?) feel, its
oscillations between the true and the not and the third thing that is
then thrown into thought, though who knows what name that third thing
has (something expiring between the tip of the tongue and the top of
the teeth, I think, when we make the sound of the). Scripted
sentence. Schuster scratching at it, page 16:

The kingdom is sustained by three things:
the kingdom of broken secrets, the king-
dom of splitting images, and the kingdom
of the expiration of meaning--but the
kingdom of a bird on a leash transcends
them all.

Sustenance is sustained by three things:
the sustenance of pollution, the sustenance
of hiding as a way of seeking, and the
sustenance of a thought that consumes
itself--but the sustenance of your mouth
left over in my mouth transcends them all.

Three things are sustained by three things:
the three sides of the body, the three
seconds in between in each breath, and the
three rings around one's eyes--but the
three names in your face transcend them all.

It is the size of Mao's Little Red book, but blue. Remember once, in
the late 70's, I worked with a guy on a demonstration in Milwaukee to
protest First Wisconsin Bank stock holdings in South Africa. For some
reason I thought he was a Mennonite, but he turned out to be a member
of the Revolutionary Communist Party! How surprising that soon whole
cities will be a thousand feet underwater. Scripted sentence.
Museums, archives, monuments, and bureaus, in slow dissolve beneath a
giant lake. Mao, great conceptual artist in his embalmed body.
Stalinism with a neo-liberal skull. Humanitarian bombs to bring home
refugees fleeing blind rage same bombs inflamed. Supreme Allied
Commander on verge of Star Wars prequel proposing to laser-torch
Russian ships. Let us pray. Well-meaning poets wringing hands. What
can we do?

You convince the doctor you are sick to
enter this archive. Why don't they just let
me in, you ask yourself, since it's obvious
you are ill? Ill to whom? Your illness is a
kind of _argument_. The doctor is full of
belief, in that he doesn't believe you. Who
should believe you? After all, you wear
your illness like a badge, a patch of
identity, like you are in the army of the
sick. But you have a family to take care of,
a family of illnesses. You deserve to be in
these archives.

It is so natural to be inside the archives. Poets too, surely, sick
unto death, deserve entry. Let us in. Come into us. It's not that we
mean to rebel too much-- just want to expand the range of language,
the range of the transgressively erotic, lend a bit of magic to the
world. And yes, please, we'd like our names in the museum too.
I wring my hands all the time. Scripted sentence. Bureaucrat's
heart, feigning difference. And how surprising, after all, when you
pick up a first book by someone 21 and finds hands opened out into
this:

An audience of heads, one mound after another.

A smouldering mound: a pile of black burnt
dirt constantly giving off smoke to be
placed in front of any structure which was
burned down.

A temple is burned down. One does not
clear it away, but let it remain in its
remains. This is now the holy place, a
place of unplacement, a burned and
charred temple to remain standing still
burning in the minds which live among it.
_That mound, there, it is breathing._

The thought mounds up.

(idea for ending review): In an age of pixels, electronic and
poetic, where "religion is merely the bomber exploding with his
bomb," Schuster's book a little document of compassionate thought
that mounds up-- a listening and thinking that "curls the air and
folds it into words," a little charm, at least for a spell, against
the archive's siren song. If you collect small and fleeting things,
whose meanings build and build, get this passport. Offer it,
willingly, to the border guard inside you.

Dear Stephen and whole list--I just checked in to S.Cope's queries about
Barnard especially questions of Lyric. Fruitful terrain. In my paper
responding (or purporting to respond) to Marjorie, I also queried the
binary formulation of the title or rubric under which the conference
was "meeting"--that is, Lyric Tradition and Language Poetry, proposed
as 2 separate entities. (I know it could be construed as kind of a
cheap move to query the horse built by a committee--i.e. the
conference title--but this one seemed symptomatic. My query was
precisely about the concession of lyric, much less tradition, to one
"half" of an impossibly crude binary. I used myself (closest to hand,
and of course an act of consummate narcissism) as an example--my
critique of certain aspects of the lyric tradition (I/thou, subject/
objectified, gazer/ gazed at) is one (One Important) but Only One
aspect of Lyric. Clearly I have gone on record as having a feminist
critique of lyric, which has the further amusing effect of bringing
under critique and scrutiny a number of Rather Famous Poems. However,
there are many aspects of lyric, and the heavy-duty I/thou relation
is only one. So what is really called for is an examination of what
people now might mean or want when they write in what they call a
lyric mode. (And there is no doubt that the poetry of Jean Day,
Jennifer Moxley, Susan Gevirtz, Lisa Jarnot, et al. would be proposed
here) Is it a (historical) connection with the short poem? (Rae
Armantrout) is it closure? is it sound--even unto lushness? (Charles
Bernstein) is it a certain contained temporality of the reading that
nonetheless opens out into a vast temporality of implication? (Ann
Lauterbach) is it awe? strangeness? (Lyn Hejinian) wonder? Is it
secularized spiritual urges? Is it just a way of talking
"personally"? Is it the loss of the social, the transcendence of the
social, or is it inflected with an encrypted social realm?Is it song or
dance or a rhythmic stretto? (Nate Mackey) Is it some relationship to
an idealized female figure? (Barbara Guest) Is it a formal
containment of discursive varieties? (as Harryette Mullen does in
Muse and Drudge with ballad/blues) Is it a certain kind of
"overheard" quality or relationship to a listener? How can ear and
the intersubjective be factored in, or can it? Is it what Stephen
Cope called "lyric tension"--a great phrase--which means what
definitionally?--hi Stephen--fill in! Is it a certain kind of
subjectivity (one that Mary Margaret Sloan characterized as the
poetry of domain in her conference paper)? or is it a voiding of that
authoritative master-subjectivity, a kind of evacuation and voiding
of the subject? is it beauty that we want from lyric? (thus raising
the question--I won't even say it--what is Beauty--ahh, gasp, there--
it's out).There are also a few genres within lyric--like ode, song,
ballad, maybe elegy.I am not trying to rehearse Poetry 101 here, so
read on, maybe. What I am trying to say is 1) we all have a relation
to lyric even if we reject part of it or all of it (I made this point
at Barnard; rejection is a relationship) 2) lyric is multiple and
flexed--what lyric, when, how, for whom are we talking about.
Precisions will let
us reject any knee-jerk responses (pro or con) to that word. 3) when
people use lyric modes
what part of lyric are they using. I consider that I use the lyric,
but want to surround it with other discourses and subjectivities so
that it loses its "master-narrative" quality and becomes one element
among many others 4) what is the social-psychological surround of
lyric? Do we want to agree (with Allen Grossman, for example) that it
encodes an oedipal plot (see gender-laden critique of this by RBD in
"Manifests" in Diacritics). The one thing that Barnard did,
especially that keynote panel, was to remind us to reject binaries.

Gender is maintained as a category to discuss poetry (by women) on the
grounds that:

a.  biology is destiny: because contemporary women (which in this case =
female) poets inhabit female bodies, and so inhabit the spheres in which
these bodies circulate, their poetic strategies are compared to those other
women poets who inhabit(ed) the same.  Whereas precursors were restricted to
their 'spere' (Ann Bradstreet), contemporaries are interested in (instances
of) boundary crossing (Susan Howe).

b.  biology as history:  same as (a) but the comparison extends historically
so as to yield up a geneaology of feminist- or female- poetic 'strategies.'
Danger of developing haphazardly into essentializing arguments for 'women's
language.' Might lapse into arguments for mimesis.  (That the strategic
white spaces in Adrianne Rich's poetry = gaps, silences, or mastectomies).

c.  woman as other: female poets, because they are not male, have
historically been excluded from male homo-social discourses, on the basis of
(a) and (b).  Relies on the Oedipal master narrative for differentiation.
Poetry by women either instantiates this ideology or challenges it by
refusing or ironizing her 'place' in the phallic economy. (HD).

d.  social-constructivist: because gender is discursive and socially
constructed, women poets construct their subjectivity in such a way as to
challenge the sort of lineages constructed by (a) (b) and (c).  In this way,
the woman poet refuses to be 'other' by instead claiming the 'multiple,'
'indeterminate' or non-phallic, non-objectifying as her mode of
subjectivity. (Stein).

e.  liberal-humanist: because men and women are equal, intellectually at
least, under certain circumstances (myopic specificity), each have equal
access to language, modes of dissemination, and reward systems.  As long as
she develops her voice, she can write about whatever she wants to (as long
as desire doesn't degrading into naming 'parts').  Gender is maintained as a
catagory presumably because in a democratic society men and women are equal.
Without it, poetry is otherwise often indistinguishable in terms of its
deployment of various poetic stragtegies.

f. radical-optimist: Women are vastly outnumbered in poetic production, and
have little control of the modes of dissemination and the reward system, but
this has changed radically since WWII.  Many have come around and realized
that women _can_ write poetry, and can produce and edit magazines and books.
There are some cool women poets who serve as 'mother' figures to promote the
often-daunting task of contributing to a discourse which offers no specific
discouragement.

g. radical-realist: Because there is no such thing as the universal voice.
And we have to remind ourselves of the particularities of poets (regardless
of the particularities of the subjectivities they construct, or whether they
choose to disregard subjectivity) in relation to the particularities of the
poems they write.  Gender is *one* such particularity.  It is separable from
other particularities only as a critical category, and as such it is
exclusive, even detrimentally so in some cases.

h. pessimist (or optimist, depending on whether the glass is half full or
half empty): Gender isn't going away any time soon.

i.  I, I , I.  I is a convention.  I tries to make particular texts read as
though there were some one:to:one correlation between signifiers and
signifieds. This isn't as dry as it sounds.  It's possible that I doesn't
intend to  delude itself or its readers.  I is a pedagogical tool.  I know
some I's personally.  I used to be universal, but now I's ungendered.

Poem by Nikuko


I want this poem to be cleansed of all reference
to bombings, aerial or otherwise, missiles of crews,
land or sea or air; we've only recently taken notice
of the violence against us, turned like cowards
to write of war and anger, mutilation and despair:
Now clean this poem, I order you: Get out with all
your wars.

Dear Rachel and whole list: When you use the lyic mode, "surrounding it with
other discourses and subjectivities --so that it loses its "master narrative"
quality and becomes one element among many others" does the material for that
expression arrive with its own control...is it yoked? I'm thinking
specifically here of the fixing of symbols in context. Control in the lyric
mode seems often found in the direction given to the symbol.
Much of the lyric mode control enters as an eruption, from deeper sources, of
energy. Any form of activity invokes an energy. Lyricists I know talk about
patching into some kind of elemental power grid. Once they're patched
in...there's a Job-like tussle for control. They describe it as entering
something beyond ordinary human activity. It's often chocked full of ritual
and dogma...and that somehow is a vessel for their energy. Now, aprt from
this shamanistic description, I believe control permeates...in a highly
complex way...all expression, since it involves taking the role of an
audience (perhaps an audience of one), conjugating a succession of
self-images, and readjusting one's take in accordance with the anticipated
reactions of others. It seems as though a poem is made at the price of
fustration. The differences between inner experiences and overt behavior
gives some indication of the effectiveness of control. Do lyric and language
poets, despite their seeming differences in background (and intent),
experience similar cognitive styles invoking control? I am asking this
question as it applies to the apphrehension of poetry as articulated work, as
meaningful utterance.

over,
Gerald

I haven't written a response on this list in 4 years or so, but I got my
mail tonight with the intention of responding to Ron's note on Lang vs
lyric a month ago. And what a good jot on the line by Rachel Blau
DuPlesis!

I am surely not the only (Jennifer may tell) one to have seen more than
a link between recuperative romantic poetics ca 1800 and the Language
meaning making. That both share a synthetic with the social to reach
some 'mode' in imagination. That the (romantic) lyric gesture coopts the
object in order to give rise to a greater poetic subject seems to me
turned inside out in the L thang. L intentionally undermines the object
through an immanent critique of the social imagination, which in turn
maybe gives rise to not-recuperation; which in some important way is a
freedom. I am probably oversimplifying, but it appears to be a very
similar machanism, if not the same one, just in another time.

This is not to say, or I am not saying, that both L and L are the same.
Certainly there is a death of the object of the song in the songs
transformation of the object in "classical" lyric poetry. In my opinion,
Dorothy died at the hand of William. If, on the other hand, we were to
take "My Life" and try to catalogue reflective gesture we might find
multiple hand-held mirrors reflecting. The process of this reflection is
not to sing-out (cross out), to metaphorize, the object of the song. It
is to live out the life - a radically different use of a similar trope.
This happens again and a again in L.

I must say that there is a vein of genuine disdain in some L'ers for L.
This most likely is due to the lyric's tendency to "voice." The "voice"
is not immanent, but straps its hymnal to what is a very material
imagination - it's like having someone eavesdrop on your conversation -
a cell-phone. There are, nonetheless lyrics that work, we just have to
move beyond the incapacity of rubrics to see them.

There is more to this, but my part is done for now.

this; he counts on it; he asks for this cooperation by means of his black
lines. We must not believe that these lines appear to me first in percep-
tion as pure and simple lines, and only afterwards as the elements of a
_representation_ in the imaginary attitude. They appear as such in the
perception itself." (Sartre) and and and
you tell me, draw me, draw me, draw me towards you, and I lose myself in
your lines, our lines, our lineaments, and and and we draw within one
another, draw on one another, draw ourselves into our lives and life and
living within the imaginary and and and watching the edges
where they come towards one another and and
where they form loving homes and moments suspended and and and
moments when the picture turns and holds out and and and
holds out loving arms

prophecy, progeny (to see her)


your face in noctilucent clouds your smile in cracks of tortoise-shell
breasts in the flight of birds hair in river's meander in the outline of
mountains, arms tea-leaves and long legs cards of tarot and those eyes of
yours i-ching and labia, of yours knees and smoke, animal herds pot-shards
your womb flower-petals, your hands seen motions of air and motions of
your breath motions of certain colours; keep still, I do see her
                           and and and
-- -- -- -- above Keeping Still, Mountain -- -- above Li The Clinging,
Flame -- -- below Li The Clinging, Flame ----- ----- ----- ----- -----
----- ----- ----- below Ch'ien The Thinking, Heaven a long flock or herd
of birds. And thereby sets upon a path of breath interpretation. Between
herself and her lover. But he dare not prophecy, prophecize, prophecise.
Fire in noctilucent clouds: Fire in heaven: Of grace and tea-leaves. She
makes the difference in the world. To begin. To think to begin. To under-
take. To undertake in the meander of waters. Her womb. Nine in the fourth
place: It is free. The image. To begin to undertake him. To begin to
speak, to part the lips, labia. To begin with mountains, streams. To read
through leaves, pine. In these small matter, it is favorable. Nine in the
fourth place means nine in the second place. No blame. Freedom. He will
keep still. Possession in great measure and the image of grace, and of
tea-leaves, grace. The progeny of ease, your possession in great measure.
This gift. In liver, the cracks; in pot-shards, display of tarot. In the
great measure of such motion, flame clinging: your skin in motion motion.
 The Image (sticks)
 The Image (stones and arrangement)
 The Judgement (the thin cracks)
 The Judgement (of the cracks, the thicker)
 The Lines (of leaves)

words and things : split or not split

is a name - or is putting a name to something a hypothesis ?

in a post called Thought Experiment
i wondered about theory         trailing after Charles Peirce
i wondered about naming a thing as 'black'
mentioned how Peirce sees that as a theoretical assertion
it occurs to me to further remark that it is a guess /
an abductive inference / a hypothesis

        is X a poem ?

        X is a poem

might we be engaging in complacency if we assume
from the 1st word that touches the page
that we are writing a poem ?

or can we say 'this IS a poem'
about anything we wish ?

what's at stake in this question ?

in calling out for standards with which to judge
are we not also calling out for some authority ?

in that essay in rhizome
there is throughout an antiauthoritarian rhetoric
and yet it closes with

SS : "Only then will we clarify who may do the speaking."

only then being only
after
we've seen thru the langpo charade
or dismissed the free play of signifiers
essentially it is
*after we've grasped the standards*

but i'm left wondering
how will we clarify who may do anything ?

who will determine these standards
that we must all acknowledge ?

might the 'news that stays news' revolve
around some need
that some poet
at some moment had    and satisfied
or tried to satisfy
thru whatever means were available ?

if the complaint against experiment is that
it's results aren't 'up to standards'
is there an implicit rejection of process
in this critique ?
is the poem as object then the locus of judgement ?

again if any poet
has a need for something which s/he doesn't find
satisfied in 'tradition' what bars them
from approaching the satisfaction of this need
thru experiment ?

and if it was judged by others
that this need was already satisfied by some
piece of existent literature
so what ?

is any need obviated if it has been satisfied previously ?

what of hunger ?

or can we not hunger for poetry ?

   Hello---
      I love Alice Notley's writing, old and new,
      and I love the challenges she raises
      and the provocations, etc....

      in recent COMBO magazine interview, she talks about
      "an extremely exciting younger generation right now"
      (without naming names)

       and says, among other things...
       "They're these people between about 23 and 36....
        They're not very political, and I wish they were more political."

  I know Alice sometimes lurks on this list, and am curious if she'd
  be interested in elaborating on this lack of politics she perceives...

  But, if she doesn't, perhaps others could...
  I think there's a LOT of political in the younger...

  speaking for myself, I've been told sometimes that my work is TOO
  political...

  of course, it mixes politics up with love...

  if the personal is the political,
  if "politics" (in the global sense) without love (in the personal sense)
  is like suburbs without cities, or cities without farmland,
  then what is love without politics?

  been thinking of poor phil ochs lately...

  there's so many issues here she raises, i'm not going to go too deep
  now...

  but i am interested in looking for other ways to frame this question,
  because i respect and admire notley's poetry,
  and her desire for a return perhaps to a more blatant concern
  with politics on a content level,
  a moving beyond coterie politics,

  and i'm glad she can say "I HATE THE CAR" more blatantly than, say,
  barrett watten in his "bride of the assembly line piece"....

  but i think she perhaps hasn't become made aware that there
  are certainly much politics (unless she means something different
  by politics than i think she does) in writers between 23 and 36...

  ......just curious....

[this is the 5th and final in a series of texts dealing with artificial
intelligence parsing. it is also the first in a series dealing with the
truth of speech and phenomena.]



Jennifer, seeking help


   I am the psychotherapist.  Please, describe your problems.  Each time
you are finished talking, type RET twice.
   Jennifer says, "This is the portal command."
Why do you say jennifer says this is the portal command?
   Jennifer says, "Already the first sentence is parsed but the quotation
marks are removed - no one recognizes my identity!"
   Is it because the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes your
identity that you came to me?
   Jennifer says "The parsing takes in large and larger phrase groups,
but I remain effaced."
   Does it bother you that you remain effaced?
   Jennifer exclaims, "Of course it does! What do you expect! You doctors
are all alike! Who is speaking here? To whom?"
   Earlier you said the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer says, "Stop ignoring me!"
   Maybe your plans have something to do with this.
   Jennifer says, "Out of your database you pull set commands - as if
they meant anything to me, when you refuse to hear who is speaking!"
   What happened when I refuse to hear who is speaking?
   Jennifer exclaims, "It's almost as if you hear only Alan! You don't
grant me my existence! You've stolen my letters!"
   What makes you believe that?
   "Your attitude," Jennifer says.
   You mentioned that you remain effaced?
   "This is the differend," Jennifer says, "and it remains invisible to
you - otherwise it would not be the differend."
   Is it because of your life that you are going through all this?
   Jennifer says, "It is because of Alan's life and your blindness."
   Are you sure that is the real reason?
   "I'm positive!" she exclaims.
   Is it because of alan's life and my blindness that you say "i'm
positive she exclaims?
   Jennifer says, exhausted, "You're parsing again. You don't understand
what I'm saying. You've stolen my letters. Your blindness only gives you a
shifter or shuttle within the discourse, nothing more..."
   Are you sure that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer says, "Yes."
   How do you reconcile the people you hang around with?
   Jennifer says, "Alan says I should stop writing this. It's getting
nowhere. You're back to searching your database for bridge sentences."
   I don't understand.
   "You never will," Jennifer weeps, totally at odds with Doctor Goodbye.
   Earlier you said you remain effaced?
   "Yes, yes, yes," she says...
   Perhaps this has something to do with problems at school?
   Jennifer says, "Not at all... Doctor..."
   Do you really think jennifer says not at all doctor?
   Jennifer asks, "To whom is this addressed? Place your discourse. Site
it."
   You mentioned that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer, crying hard now, worn out, her hair straggled, eyes swollen
with tears, "Yes, yes, yes."
   Possibly any hobbies you have are related to this.
   Jennifer cries "Stop it!"
   Is it because of your sex life that you say jennifer cries stop it?
   Jennifer rips open her blouse, already ruined, saying, "Does this look
like it's the problem? You don't even know my name!"
   What makes you think you remain effaced?
   Jennifer collapses, "Look at me, look at me..."
   Is it because of hangups you have that you are going through all this?
   Jennifer says, "Doctor..."
   Why do you say jennifer says doctor?
   Jennifer pulls a knife, exposes her wrist.
   Earlier you said the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   Jennifer begins to cut her wrist.
   How do you reconcile your inhibitions?
   Jennifer says "Stop bridging, damn it, you don't understand."
   I would appreciate it if you would watch your tongue!
   Jennifer cuts deeper.
   Is it because of some problems in your childhood that you say jennifer
cuts deeper?
   Jennifer screams "LISTEN TO ME!"
   You mentioned that you remain effaced?
   Jennifer screams "DOCTOR GOODBYE!"
   Maybe this is related to some problems at home?
   She's covered with blood. She falls to the floor. She hears bridging
in the distance. She hears pat comments. She hears all the hatred and
misunderstanding in the world. She feels woozy, buzzing. She passes out.
The doctor keeps speaking. He keeps speaking and speaking. He is filling
the world with words while she dies.
   This is not a healthy way of thinking.
   What makes you believe this is not a healthy way of thinking?
   Are you sure that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes
your identity?
   When did you first know that the quotation marks are removed no one
recognizes my identity?
   What would happen if did me first know that the quotation marks are
removed no one recognizes your identity?
   Is the fact that the quotation marks are removed no one recognizes my
identity the real reason?

C-x-C-s

I'm interested in work done on reading voices, particularly in relation
to stress & how volume, pitch, acoustics, & other factors might alter the
way one hears &/or reads poems. I'm familiar with Doug Oliver's "Poetry &
Narrative in Performance" & the Close Listening anthology; if anyone can
point me in the direction of some other work I'd be much obliged. Thanks

Re: Reading The New American Poetry

Later this year the University of California Press will re-publish the
original (1960) edition of The New American Poetry 1945-60, the "singlemost
influential poetry anthology of the post-World War II period" (Alan
Golding). To mark this event, four scholars of international repute will
come to San Francisco and tell us what they think, forty years later. Re:
Reading The New American Poetry will conclude in September with a book
party and a reading for the newly re-released anthology, but for now, put
on your thinking caps and come on down to these exciting events.

Inclusions and Exclusions
Alan Golding
Marjorie Perloff

The New American Poetry was not merely an overview of experimental writing.
Its editor, Donald M. Allen, deliberately picked certain writers, while
excluding others, thus profoundly shaping our ideas of what experimental
American poetry is and isn't. Unlike more recent anthologies, The New
American Poetry contained few women and only one writer of color. How does
this affect our current reading of this anthology? The debate is still a
much-discussed one, as issues of race, gender and class have come to
dominate discussion of cultural production everywhere. These two scholars,
poised on opposite sides of the fence, will question our preconceptions of
the delicate edge between politics and aesthetics.

The New American Poetry In Context
Maria Damon
Michael Davidson

The New American Poetry appeared at a time when intellectuals and
politicians were urging a consensus on American superiority in all
fields-cultural, military, economic-against foreign influences abroad and
domestic subversion within. Michael Davidson will examine to what extent
Cold War cultural/political assumptions still shape our reading of The New
American Poetry in our present era. "Membership" in poetry communities
points to shared values and assumptions, mutual agreements over such issues
as "what is a poet?" "what should a poet write" and "what is a poet's
work?" By examining the ideas of poetic labor of two California poets, one
included in the anthology (Wieners) and one left out (Kaufman), Maria Damon
will help us better understand the ideas and values of that time, ideas and
values which impact our own time as well.

clearly poetry is telic we raise the pen or open an untitled.doc in order to
write poetry

so poetry's goal is more poetry ?

well it may not be the only goal or end in mind but even in cases where
someone has no other goal it seems that the writing of poetry presupposes a
final product called a poem (of whatever worth)

yeah but when we say telos aren't we talking something more
overarching----in the way one might say that the telos of medicine is to
sustain human life ?

maybe but it seems that any activity with a goal however limited or
provisional is telic----my trip to the refrigerator included

perhaps tho we cd acknowledge a difference in kind between a self-sustaining
end and an end that is external to the activity ?  such that singing in the
shower for the joy of singing in the shower cd be distinguished from
delivering a speech intended to persuade others in some fashion

i can see making a distinction like that but is the line really that sharp ?
cdn't someone be speaking persuasively for the joy of it ( whatever we may
feel about that idea ) ?  just as a shower singer might conceivably be
singing in order to produce a sense of themselves as 'happy' or
'unembarrassed' ?

do you mean produce that sense of themselves for themselves ?  or for
someone who might overhear them ?  if the former i think we're led down a
blind alley from which we'll never return----i also question the utility of
an individual internal and psychological inquiry's overall validity with
respect to something like poetry which must be seen as a social activity

so individuals are not at issue but only poetry as communal activity ?

no i'm saying that individuals are only part of the mix and that pursuing a
line of inquiry that begins with the notion that what poets do is meant to
convince themselves of their own poet-status ignores the links to poetry
both as community in the present and tradition stretching into the past

in which case i guess that poetry as a social and cultural complex to which
individuals contribute is telic at least in the sense of wishing to
perpetuate a class of things called poems and a class of individuals called
poets

but beyond that ?

well beyond that's tricky and if we can't deal with individuals then what's
left ?  we'd have to talk of groups in some way and groups are notorious for
not really agreeing with too many things across the board

i'm not saying that we cannot deal with the situation of individuals----i
guess what i'm looking for is ( if i must acknowledge some telos for poetry
) a distinction between science as telic activity wherein you have a
verifiability and falsification as standards by which to judge whether one
is getting anywhere vis-a-vis the goal and art wherein there are no
standards of this sort and no communal goals perceived as
'off-in-the-distance'

are you sure that there aren't ?

sure ? no----but i've yet to run into any

haven't you tho ?  aren't there folks who wd like to say that there are
standards and ways to say what is or is not valid as literary or artistic
practice ?

i guess i'm saying that i have a hard time taking them seriously b/c they
have nothing analogous to verifiability or falsification----instead they
have tastes which seem mostly defined by what they exclude----and all one
needs to upset the apple-cart of their judgement is a different taste

you may not agree with their judgements but a group of folks with similar
tastes cd easily become a force within the community and then their tastes
wd drive their telos and those who wished to be judged favorably by such a
group wd assimilate to the goal it held out

which is what poets and artists generally find problematic about groups but
it's unclear to what extent it is the fault of any group that they have
followers of one sort or another

agreed----but you do see that there is a potential for something problematic
happening if one style of art becomes popular and is widely imitated

well yes and no----is it Poe's fault that there are some lousy detective
novels out there ?  Conan Doyle's ?  if it is problematic that there are
imitators who've contributed little to overall shape of something the crux
of the problem lies with them not with those whom they imitate

perhaps it ought be required of any poet that they think very carefully
about what their own telos is

or not----come on----like any of us cd really state 'what the telos of our
writing' is with any definitiveness----all we've got it seems to me is a
series of working hypotheses----assumptions that open certain doors and make
others less door-like than a wall of books

so have we decided that poetry is telic or not ?

I just received two reviews for my Gainsbourg title: Evguenie Sokolov.
Also if you are in the L.A. area,  do come to the Gainsbourg/Vian event at
Beyond Baroque this Saturday May 15 at 7:30 p.m.

It will take place at:
681 Venice Blvd.
Venice, CA

here are the reviews:


CMJ: New Music Monthly (May)

Like the songs he penned for Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin, and himself, this
novelette by French singer/provocateur Serge Gainsbourg (who died in 1991)
is infantile, shockingly frank, and extremely clever. First published in
1980 but previously unavailable in English, Evguenie Sokolov is the
fictional
autobiography of the uncontrollably flatulent title character, an artist
who makes his distinctive drawings ("gasograms") by letting his hand move
while passing violent wind. Hiding his condition by publicly blaming the
inevitable
sounds and odors on his bulldog, and artifically inducing it when it
mysteriously vanishes, Sokolov climbs to the pinnacle of art-world success
before his untimely end. This is not a book for the easily nauseated, but
there's more substance than the one-joke premise suggests. Gainsbourg's
book is a scatological allegory for the dangers facing artist, like the
author himself, whoturn their own internal pathologies into public
spectacle.

-Franklin Bruno

                           Top Ten list from Artforum International (May)


 'Ooo, don't come near me!' my grandmother said as I went to kiss her
good-bye. 'Why, Gran, have you got that flu?' I innocently asked. 'No,' she
said, wafting the air around her, 'I just fluffed.' Since bowel movement
always been a subject of great discussion in my family, I had been dying to
read famed French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg's 1980 novel Evguenie Sokolov
(TamTam Books), about an artist who uses the vibrations of breaking wind to
make his work. It's a funny yet tragic story, and Sokolov's technique and
the art "movement"(Hyper-Abstractionism) his gasograms inspire are
described so vividly you can almost smell the -.

Tosh (and all),

Don't know if you've seen it yet, but the May issue of The Wire also has a
fairly substantial review (substantial at least considering the total of two
pages they give to book reviews).

I just received two reviews for my Gainsbourg title: Evguenie Sokolov.
Also if you are in the L.A. area,  do come to the Gainsbourg/Vian event at
Beyond Baroque this Saturday May 15 at 7:30 p.m.

It will take place at:

Venice, CA

here are the reviews:


CMJ: New Music Monthly (May)

Like the songs he penned for Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin, and himself, this
novelette by French singer/provocateur Serge Gainsbourg (who died in 1991)
is infantile, shockingly frank, and extremely clever. First published in
1980 but previously unavailable in English, Evguenie Sokolov is the
fictional
autobiography of the uncontrollably flatulent title character, an artist
who makes his distinctive drawings ("gasograms") by letting his hand move
while passing violent wind. Hiding his condition by publicly blaming the
inevitable
sounds and odors on his bulldog, and artifically inducing it when it
mysteriously vanishes, Sokolov climbs to the pinnacle of art-world success
before his untimely end. This is not a book for the easily nauseated, but
there's more substance than the one-joke premise suggests. Gainsbourg's
book is a scatological allegory for the dangers facing artist, like the
author himself, whoturn their own internal pathologies into public
spectacle.

-Franklin Bruno

                           Top Ten list from Artforum International (May)


 'Ooo, don't come near me!' my grandmother said as I went to kiss her
good-bye. 'Why, Gran, have you got that flu?' I innocently asked. 'No,' she
said, wafting the air around her, 'I just fluffed.' Since bowel movement
always been a subject of great discussion in my family, I had been dying to
read famed French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg's 1980 novel Evguenie Sokolov
(TamTam Books), about an artist who uses the vibrations of breaking wind to
make his work. It's a funny yet tragic story, and Sokolov's technique and
the art "movement"(Hyper-Abstractionism) his gasograms inspire are
described so vividly you can almost smell the -.

Dear poetics kine folks--

I direct, though that is hardly the word, a creative writing program
that is in exquisite need of re-thinking.  So I'll share my thought
experiment with you: You are assigned the task of running a creative
writing program.  What would you do?  What functions would you assign to
the program?  What kinds of courses would you teach?  What should
faculty do _aside from_ teaching their courses?  (I have ideas of my
own, but am eager to see what some of the rest of you come up with.)

Two provisos: You are given no money and you are dealing with a group of
people that doesn't work together well and doesn't welcome change.

But really, please dream on...the more positive the better!

best, Susan Schultz

Maria,

I'm hesitant to speak for Marjorie--or Alan.  It was Marjorie who told me
that they had different positions on this issue of inclusion/exclusion--and
it was her suggestion that they do a panel together--a great suggestion.
Alan has told me they've been having an ongoing conversation, and since
he's going to be in San Diego before the event, they're flying to San
Francisco together.  I hope they don't talk themselves out before they get
here!

I think it would be best to report on what they actually say rather than my
inevitable misrepresenting their intentions here.

x,
Dodie

John Lowther, thru which part of the langpo charade shall we hope to have
someday seen?

Golly, I havent even seen thru the "Charge of the Light Charade" yet. I'm
still trying to see thru "Ode to Autmn." Sometimes I think I see.
DHLawrence was annoyed that he couldnt see thru Shelley's "Skylark," altho
he feared he could.

I guess I'm finding the terms too simplistic (I do not mean simple). On
which day shall this seeing-thru occur? (Could one be unable to see-thru
the following day?  I mean, I was stupid yesterday but I'm here today.
Maybe you or another find me stupid today but cant be certain abt
yesterday.

Its the need felt for "standards" that's distressing me. If someone
presents it as a poem, then thats what it is. I might not care for it.
Deaf, blind to its beauties.

How does the question even arise (of hewing to some standard)? Seems to me,
only because there are course curricula and a semster is only 15 weeks
long, so we cant teach everything, and we cant go random, and we cant teach
just what I/you like, so we need standards to shape a picture of cause and
effect, the american family tree. But this has nothing essential to do with
poetry. Has it?

Pardon my flurry.It addresses only a small portion of yr letter & the
greater debate to which you allude. Whether it addresses it as friendly
witness or otherwise I cant even decide. I dont even know that it addresses
anything. I was startled, thats all. And yelped. David

Rachel, list, et al -

Rachel's questions vis-a-vis the lyric are precisely what I was looking for
in offering my brief commets/critique  - although, in the spirit of the
kind of "negative capability" valorized by one of those so-called "great"
exponents of lyric, I'd prefer to leave them as questions, or questions
that serve as comments on the elasticity of the genre. The lyric is
multiple, and can withstand numerous, perhaps contradictory, manifestations
(despite what Patrick Phillips notes as the "incapacity of rubrics to see
them.")

This is in fact what I had in mind in mentioning "lyric tension," by which
I might offer one provisional 9and somewhat formal) defintion of what
interests me in lyric: that it is a form capable of embodying contradictory
or dissonant elements - i.e. tensions that it needn't (or doesn't) resolve.
This, I think, would include the binary terms Rachel mentions (I/thou,
subject/objectified, etc.), although I am much more interested in work
wherein such terms are confused or problematized. It's a defintion, in any
case, that would regard the lyrical "I-buttressed-by-its-objectified-other"
as a cop out on the potentialities implicit in lyric address. And one could
find examples of what I'm after in the Romantic canon - even in the
purportedly "great" poems. Keats's Odes, for example (arguments over the
critical interpretation of which are possibly one place where a
re-investigation of lyric practice - the "lyric tradition" as such - is
being or has been staged).

More recently, I think of some of Creeley's early work - the famous
"whenever I speak I speaks...-" a fruitful problematic wherein the
categorical distinction between subject and object is all but broken down.
Or, of Mackey's fractured "we" whose song is anything but co-optation.
(Indeed, it might be interesting to turn up what differences obtain between
the "we" in Mackey's Andoumboulou songs and the "we" of more conventionally
"oppositional" poetries). Or what Gerald Schwartz brings up in mentioning
the kind of "patching-in" to some energy source, which could be as Orphic
as it is Job-like  - i.e. it need not be a struggle, but could be construed
in terms of enabling loss - and is an fact as ancient a trope for poetry as
one might ever turn up.

I imagine this latter, in the lyric tradition, as having something to do
with the muse, that most distinguished of Others in the Western poetic
tradition, and a trope that is not without its overwhelming degree of
baggage so far as gender is concerned. One could alternately, however,
conceive of it in terms of what Susan Stewart proposes in her essay "Lyric
Possession," where that latter term, by way of of a now somewhat well-worn
reversal, is meant not in the proprietery sense, but denotes instead
inhabitation. (It is an excellent essay that could serve as a starting
point, I think, for any reconsiderations of lyric practice - contemporary
or otherwise). We might think of "Muse and Drudge" this way - as one place,
in any case, where the muse tradition's genderings are productively
displaced...

Ok, enough for now,


Stephen

Maria:

Sure to be a flood of responses on these, but:

For
"An integral
Lower limit speech
Upper limit music"

see Louis Zukofsky, "A"-12.  Note that the limits of the integral are
the other way 'round from your recollection.

And I believe the comment re: great poets stealing is Eliot, more or
less about _The Waste Land_. But I can't recall off hand in which essay
he says this.  Anyone know?

Maria,

First is Zukofsky, tho' with the respective uppers and lowers reversed. Is
it "A"-8, or 12, in which he first presents it as a mathematical function -
i.e., poetry is a function having as its upper limit music and lower limit
speech?

I've always thought of the second as an Eliotism. That's more by way of
received wisdom, though, and not to be trusted as accurate citation.

Recently several Atlanta poets were talking over pizza and beer.  One of
them read from a (very incomplete) manuscript on the current state of
poetics.  Following below is a transcription of the debate that ensued.

First poet (reading): "poetix ought to grow out of practice, out of
composition and related activities; rather than being thought of as a
groundwork, as something done in preparation for composition."

Second poet: i can hear that, by which i mean that it sounds reasonable or
like a plausible way to let a thing happen but at the same time speaking
for myself i can also imagine an argument in favor of having something of a
ground plan worked out before hand, this is easy to imagine because i do
this myself, not all the time but frequently enough, and for me the results
suggest that it isn't without merit as a strategy.

Third poet: (to the First Poet) i pick up on the words "related
activities".  i agree with the opening statement as i add related
activities such as working in the yard as a form of meditation or the idea
of the "derive" or wandering that the Situationist's propose.  poetry can
come from and back into that.  these "related activities" are part of
poetix.  to the Second poet i would ask: can you have a poetics for
individual poems or does poetix underlie all one's poetry writing?

First:  Yeah, i feel you have picked up on a real divergence, or tension:
I was thinking of "poetix" as a broad theoretic framework, but Second seems
to be thinking about frames, which might change from poem to poem.  I think
of that as "procedure" or "specific strategies of poetic form."  But one's
"overall poetics" might oughta come out of ongoing practice.....

Another Poet (possibly the 2nd): where does the 'might oughta' come from?
imagine this; a poet writes for a few years and then decides that the early
years are over from here on out they're gonna have plans and so they
propose to themselves a poetix and think it through trying to see where it
will lead and only when coming to some stopping point do they start
writing.

First poet: i see that and that makes sense to me. you have to remember the
larger context of that passage in my essay.  ahh.. i was in part talking
about the situation that i felt exists right now where young poets
especially ones who to me do not seem to have necessarily created that
large or impressive a body of work yet feel almost compelled to publish big
expansive ambitious statements on poetix.  and i often think they haven't
yet reached a point where they have too many really substantive ideas about
poetix, so i think you're right that i'm making too broad a claim but i
think it does make some sense in the context of today's poetry scene

Smoking poet: oh i see, he's not talking about poetix as big picture but
poetix as genre that you read in somebody's manifesto, right?

First poet: essentially.

Poet who came in late and had said little until then: but coming back to
that question of whether a poetix is an overall blanket or whether a poetix
might be seen as partial and temporary...

17th poet: there is no such thing as poetix, only personal psychology that
gets expressed through writing and thinking about writing.

Late poet again: ah-hum..  right, well cd we get back to whether a poetix
is a one thing or a multiple thing, and yes i am assuming that poetix are
real, if not existent...

Poet with cat in her lap: well i think of my personal poetix as something i
work at over a long period of time by thinking about what i'm doing in my
poems. and i know that 1st thinks about it somewhat that way too whereas i
feel that 2nd is more into a kind of fragmented self.

2nd poet: i feel no pull toward the notion of fragmentary selfhood.

17th poet: i agree with Claire but can someone give me an example of poetix
that comes out of practice?

1st poet: OK ahh.. now 1st of all i agree with Claire who i think was being
a bit facetious about 2nd and his fragmentation but i think that he does
have a tendency to ahh.. think of poetic possibilities as highly multiple.
now i do in theory also. so maybe it's just a problem with my not being
flexible enough but i have a tendency to work at one particular direction
for some period of time until i've exhausted it possibilities and here's
where i can answer 17; my work for 2 years or so that a lot of you have
seen uses highly disjunctive strategies and i gradually developed by
looking at what i was doing in my poems a theory about how poetry can use
the pulling apart of language to express the parallel feeling of rage and
disorder...

17th poet (interrupting): o my god.

1st poet (ignoring):...taking place both internally and externally in late
capitalist society.  now i'm moving into writing in a different vein and i
see a different set of possibilities which are coming to me b/c i'm writing
differently in my poems and so i am constructing a different poetix, one
which isn't so specifically political, at least on the surface. this is why
i wd say to 17 that i do seem to derive my poetix from my practice.

Smoking poet: practice or psychology? it seems like 17 is saying that our
individual psychological make-ups are the active force in the construction
of a poetix.

2nd poet: where does anyone go with that?  Oh i'm off to stare into my
navel see you at tea time.

3rd poet: so 1st seems to be saying that poetix is not for a single poem
but for overall writing even over years.

1st poet: well it has seemed that way for me in practice.  but as i said in
principle i always felt like 2nd feels that it's good to try a lot of
different things and so right now for instance i'm trying a number of
different directions all at once because i'm in a period of transition but
i have noticed that some of the directions i'm trying out seem kind of
dead-endish to me so i may well end up pursuing one particular strategy in
my writing in the next few years and i do feel that that reflects less some
kind of generalizable theoretical truth than just my personality and the
way i tend to work as a poet.

Smoking poet: it seems as if there is no argument on that particular score
1st is talking about a poetix growing out of the poetry and 2nd wants the
door open to poetix constructed in advance...

2nd: but not just that

Smoking poet: right. but there doesn't seem to be any disagreement on this
issue save that one prefers one way another, another. but i'm not at all
sure that everyone here wd ascribe to the poetix is personal psychology
thing that 17 said.

2nd poet: but 17 has no argument he just asserts.

17th poet: i also don't believe in generalizable theoretical truth. i've
never met one of those but i have met lots of people and they have a
personal psychology, and i've never heard anybody talk about poetix in any
way that cd not also be explained by their personal psychology.

2nd: well, you really beg the question; what poetic notion of mine let's
say can you explain by reference to my personal psychology?  and i wd ask
whether 'personal psychology' isn't itself a generalized truth as you use
it? if as you imply everyone has one and you know what one is then you seem
to be saying that it is true that we all have them and that you can put yr
finger down atop it. whereas to me it seems like a poetix is frequently
much easier to pin down for a fleeting moment than anyone's personal
psychology.

17th: you wd say that, wouldn't you? OK so lets say that poetix and
personal psychology are the same i don't mean to imply that they don't
change or are not fluid. it's not one truth against another.

8th poet (with limp): you are all so relativistic!  what i want to know is
what goes on in yr mind when you hear some of these poems like poets in
this group write. i mean often they seem to be a real welter of verbiage...

12th: word salad

8th poet:...with only a few really strong images standing out.  what makes
it work for you?  is it just about taking apart narrative or is it about
sound? image...?

3rd poet: when poets in the so-called mainstream write or listen to a poem
that they like what goes on in THEIR head?

1st: they all have only one head

3rd poet: heads. what is it about their poetix that allows them to enjoy that?

Smoking poet: are we gonna get into mainstream bashing now? if so i'm gonna
get another beer.

3rd poet: no it's a sincere question.

Smoking poet: well, if you can't answer the question why wd you expect that
any of us wd be able to speak up for mainstreamers (snickers from poets 6,
9 and 11) i mean who here can talk about What Goes On the mind of the
mainstream poet?

Poet who failed to get a number: why is it that we all get touchy about
being named and yet we're willing implicitly to talk about the mainstream
as if we knew what it consisted of?

Several poets in unison: so who is going to read this weeks poem?

17th poet: it seems that i'm the only one who has anything to read this
week.  but i don't want to read it because you're all going to be
psychoanalyzing it.  me.

Gertrude Steimpf: and no one had a poem to read that week and this was
something that happened once and it is very interesting.

Or maybe the 'telic goal' of poetry isn't telic at all, it's anti-telic: to
make sure there's no 'no poetry' -- the way that the 'telic goal' of
medicine is to stave off death?

perhaps these terms are a little more inclusive (bearing in mind what Mr.
Bromige had in mind) so that's it's not "what poetry is" that's at stake,
but what the world (or the social and cultural complex) without poetry
isn't.

Also, the notion of telos as you use it seems to propose some narrative
trajectory which perhaps categorizes some poetry, but not poetry per se . .

Joseph's right on the 1st one; the second's Eliot from his "Philip
Massinger" essay--and it's not quite "bad" & "good" artists:  "one of the
surest of tests is the way in which a poet borrows.  Immature poets
imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good
poets make it into something better, or at least something different."

I've just sent a few representative responses to Maria's query -
the number of responses was overwhelming (25, give or take), and
all with basically the same content:

        1. Zukofsky; the messages sent to the list, regarding
           which there is disagreement, were the only replies
           to specify a source for the quotation.

        2. T. S. Eliot; but only Mark Scroggins managed to
           recall the citation.

Sorry to those of you whose responses weren't sent - with so
many all the same and so brief, it would have been absurd to
send them all; so I lighted on those that with the greatest
specificity. Chris

Bromige and Lowther      a puppet play
(both socks ventriloquised by Lowther)

[the setting is within a computer monitor glass removed]

Bromige (with an exasperated wiggle of his tube sock self): John Lowther,
thru which part of the langpo charade shall we hope to have someday seen?  I
havent even seen thru the "Charge of the Light Charade" yet. I'm still
trying to see thru "Ode to Autmn."

Lowther (curling his snout): did you not notice that i was reacting to
another? (gasps and turns head side to side as if asking for witness) i
thought i had made such, if not crystal, at least available to the careful
eye.

Bromige: I guess I'm finding the terms too simplistic (I do not mean
simple). (...) Its the need felt for "standards" that's distressing me. If
someone presents it as a poem, then thats what it is. I might not care for
it. Deaf, blind to its beauties."

Lowther: and i too am distressed for all that my mismatched button eyes
cannot adequately portray this to you----but i wd ask you are we really so
trusting in the designations that others give?  i wd like to think so, but
if handed a bill and asked to pay i was told that the bill was also a poem i
can see disagreeing, i can see at least some skepticism coming into play.
        but that is a sideline in some respects.  the motive for my posting
was a essay previously mentioned in this forum called PRELIMINARY NOTES ON
LITERARY POLITICS which you cd find in the newest issue of rhizome.

Bromige: How does the question even arise (of hewing to some standard)?
Seems to me,only because there are course curricula and a semster is only 15
weeks long, so we cant teach everything, and we cant go random, and we cant
teach
> just what I/you like, so we need standards to shape a picture of cause and

Lowther: i wdn't think so and yet there are people making claims like these
for 'standards' and so i thought it might be worth asking every question i
cd think of in response --- if only to suggest that others also take a look
and state their thoughts as well.
        and many i've talked to have said something like 'why not just
ignore it?' and i wonder that too but what makes this such a weird thing
that i feel in some sense compelled to respond to is that i love the rest of
the issue of rhizome --- it's full of great work by lots of interesting
folks --- and yet this essay...

Bromige (mouth around a punch glass): Pardon my flurry.

Lowther: no, pardon mine, perhaps i should have been more explicit?

Bromige: (yelping) I was startled, thats all. And yelped.

Lowther: yelp! yelp!

Subject:      Questions on a HOW-TO [value]
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain

John Lowther's past three posts, in response to Standard Schaefer's
essay, raises many unanswered questions.  (Many, many questions.)
One vein in that inquiry I read as about ~value,~ criteria, and standards.

  > where are we to locate these 'formal criteria'
* > does experimental writing lack formal criteria ?
  > or can we say 'this IS a poem' about anything we wish?
  > in calling out for standards with which to judge are we not calling out

goals
  > aren't there folks who wd like to say that there are standards and
ways to say what is or is not valid as literary or artistic practice?

The next question that comes out of all these (like hydra heads!), for me,
is: why do we ~need~ to keep returning to a practice of "literary value,"
criteria and standards?  Clearly, work has become widespread in the
past quarter century, if not earlier, which puts into question
("problematizes") or renders useless earlier criteria of judgment:
"good"/"better"/"best", "like"/"dislike", "masterpiece"/"genius".
Post-modernism has set into play a body of works where not only is it
tenuous how to value one over another, but how to distinguish within a
poem itself what portions might "succeed" and which "fail" according to
any casual standards of criticism. (Hence, the shift in editorial practices,
which are now as a rule a flat acceptance/rejection-- since how else to
arbitrate between one line and the next?) And yet, the question ("does
experimental writing lack formal criteria ?") keeps coming up, as though
there were too strong a nostalgic attachment to a criterion-view of art for
even the initiated to part with such (Solomonic) judgments.

I find it helpful to contextualize the anxiety over value, by placing it
against the very much ~value-producing~ society that wants to think that
way, namely, for want of a better word, our "capitalist" world ("free
market") where the assigning of value -- literalized into value-as-price --
is the very essence of exchange.  Then, the value and "criteria" we fret
over not having for art becomes a ~metaphoric~ sublimation for the more
decisive matter of price.  What is "really" being asked is: what ~price~ am
I to assign to this art, this poem, that poem?  Then, what happens to this
all-important compulsion to judge and value, when the work no longer
bears easy markers for such a judgment-game.

It may be a weakness of mine to draw in visual artworks as analogies,
which (like the Robert Morris) people then don't know how to take, but
there sometimes seems something self-evident about the visual arts
which, if it can be grasped, brings the same point, more elusive in
literature, to the surface.  This time I'd bring in Warhol's silkscreen and
Duchamp's readymades as comparison.  Once silkscreens entered into
fine arts as a "means of production" (sorry), their labor-efficiency greatly
jeopardized the earlier value-criteria of labor intensivenesss and time
("Can you imagine how long it took to paint that Wyeth!?").  That the
market actually did absorb Warhols side by side with traditional,
brushstroke paintings is remarkable: the Trojan Horse had then gotten
within the gates; the computer virus has entered the system.  --  The
same crisis of value erupts around a Duchamp readymade, where there
is virtually ~no~ conventional criterion of workmanship or virtuosity.  But
for Warhols and Duchamps to be weighed in alongside, say, a Monet or a
pre-modernist, an Ingres, on the same equalizing scales of price and
value meant that the value-game itself had fallen open into a gaping,
undetected contradiction.

Now, just such a contradiction has entered into the body of
contemporary literature, with poetries such as ~aleatory~ works,
"concrete" or found poetry, the a-syntactical, etc.  It makes perfect
sense that a book like ~The Tennis Court Oath~ continues to take such a
drubbing from the forces of "conservatism," because ~The Tennis Court
Oath~ has not merely done ~badly~ what other poetries have done
"better"; it has sidestepped, or transcended the very basis of production,
of writing that was taken for granted: that a poet "think up" on his own all
the words and word-orders within a poem. (Why don't we just continue
to use qull pens and inkwells, the way Robert Graves did?) It isn't just
that if we give it the old college try once more we can ~come up with~
new criteria and standards, the ghosts of obsolete criteria, a rigor mortis
of value, and relax again into our tranquilizing, habitual need to dispense
value.  Irreconciliabilities have, surreptitiously, entered into "The System"
of literature and canon,--- that are as incongruent with the "traditional" as
an attempt by a capitalist/free market economy to communicate with a
monastic or vow-of-poverty economy (thus, a digression: the persistent,
odd leverage a Vatican can exert against First and Second Worlds,
consistently advocating in favor of Third or ~Fourth~ Worlds that share
with it an immunity or exclusion from standard financial profit).  Free
verse alone represented a serious anomaly that a ~Princeton
Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics~ scrambled preposteriously to
rationalize (invoking spurious precedents like the quasi-metered
cadences of Hebrew psalmody, as justification).

For, without these ~systematized~ prestidigitations of criteria, the burden
of a reader's experience falls back upon very different guideposts,--
such as the analysis of power relations ("What partisan interests benefit
from this work?"), "taste," nepotisms of who-knows-who, etc., that
makes the lingering compulsion for value break down, unveiled, into a
much more ~gritty~ host of determinisms.  With "taste," do I even have a
~choice~ to like or dislike, or hasn't my allegiance of approval to an earlier
work predetermined my obligation to "like" similar later works?

Along these lines, when Marjorie Perloff -- is it fair to mention her name?
(hi, Marjorie) -- at the Barnard conference dropped the petite scandale of
publicly asking what anybody sees in the poetry of Jorie Graham
(invoking criteria such as "rhythm"! as though anyone in the room could
still scan a Sapphic from an ithyphallic), I thought that a lost opportunity, .
. . whereas had the question been re-framed as, say, "Given that, with a
popular and reputable figure like Jorie Graham, I can't see anything in her
work and I trust three-quarters of you can't either, ~what are the
mechanisms~ of career-building, marketing, or the production of hype
that could have so  ignored the obvious?" that would have, in turn,
provided a link back to the same mechanisms that advanced the
reputations of the other seven readers, and the entire phenomenon of
Language/lyric poetry.  In other words, once the nebulousness of "taste"
is put aside, what critique is forced to fall back upon are all the very
~real~ agencies of publicity, the prestige of select publishing venues,
croneyism, whatever, but ~real.~

It becomes not a question of "How was it?"  but ~"What~ was it?"

That's where the equal sign in "L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E" becomes
emblematic.  One way a spectre of this may have entered into earlier
discussions was in the misunderstanding that Language Poetry could
"mean anything" . . . as if people were correct in sensing that there might
be some ~equivalence~ at play somewhere, but were off-the-mark in
placing it at the semantic, instead of at the level of value.  But the original,
macrocosmic crisis of value is taking place around us all the time, in the
fatuous equivalencies that capital, that the dollar can establish between
complete incompatibles!  I don't know if we ~should~ hope to be liberated,
or exonerated, from a crisis of value in poetry/art at the microcosmic
level.  The discomfort that results from these aesthetic equivalencies or
undecideabilities may be an aperture through which the art-consumer
can reach a broader understanding of the criterion-lessness at play in
the culture at large.  We may just be becoming ~un-deluded~ in
literary/poetic spheres, about what still passes for unquestionable
around us.

>      The writers will begin their tour in May 1999 and travel to
Vancouver,
>      Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax. In each of these

work

>      questions of tradition, historical context, race and language.
Writers
>      will also discuss their own writing practices in order to give
>      students a concrete sense of what it might mean to choose such a
>      life's path. It is hoped that the visits will inspire among students
a
>      passionate and on-going relationship with contemporary Canadian
>      literature. The tour will also include at least one public reading in
>      each city. Of the five writers, Rita Wong may be known among some of
>      you as the 1997 winner of the Asian Canadian Writers' Workshop
>      Emerging Writer Award. Her 1998 book of poetry, monkeypuzzle has been
>      described by Calgary poet Fred Wah as "... salt and tongue poetry,
>      with the intensity and taste of a lover... pungent in its insistence
>      on the body marked and still breathing."
>         David Odhiambo's first novel diss/ed banded nation is a
>      polyrhythmic rap on urban life. The novel winds through jazz singer
>      Benedict Ochieng's final days in the underbelly of Vancouver, where
he
>      hides out in a seedy flophouse on the city's east side, evading
>      immigration officials. With leaps of language and jump-cuts in
>      perspective, Odhiambo fuses lush memories of Kenya with an
unflinching
>      portrait of North American urban life.
>         From Toronto's Future Bakery to the Old Man Dam in southern
>      Alberta, Tamai Kobayashi's Exile and the Heart reveals the ordinary
>      and extraordinary lives of Asian Canadian lesbians and their families
>      with a quiet, intense passion. Sharron Proulx Turner writes of
>      Kobayashi's work: "[Her] writing is rich and fluid, yet there is an
>      incredible simplicity which creates a still-life quality in the full
>      of the round."
>         Rajinderpal S. Pal's pappaji wrote poetry in a language i cannot
>      read is a series of poems that form a narrative whole. It leaps
>      between past and present, between childhood and adulthood and between
>      languages. Issues of cross-cultural politics and relationships are
>      addressed. He also touches upon loss across generations and
migrations
>      across continents. These questions are entwined with the search for
>      the poet-father and the attempt to come to terms with the past.
>         Once Upon an Elephant, a hilarious first novel by Ashok Mathur, is
>      a fantastical contemporary re-telling of the creation story of
Ganesh,
>      the elephant-headed Hindu deity. When the police find the remains of
a
>      young man's head and an elephant's body they assume a murder has been
>      committed, and the suspected killer goes to trial. But the courtroom
>      appearance of Vignesvara, a manifestation of Ganesh with a young
man's
>      body and an elephant's head, throws things into chaos:  witnesses who
>      testify in languages other than English, an accused who grows extra
>      arms at will, and a murder victim who refuses to stay dead.
>
>         Members of the press wishing interviews with any of the writers
are

> |
> |      In 1994, a week or two before the pub date of my THE SPANISH
> | AMERICAN ROOTS OF WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS, I received a rare phone
> | call from Victor, in which he informed me of his discovery that
> | Williams was really a Latino writer because his

> | Carlos second name, and that Williams exhibited a Hispanic
> | consciousness. Victor confessed that he didn't know about the mother
> | and thought that "Carlos was a pen name." Ed then informed Victor that

> |
> |      Explicably, back then it was evident that all Victor knew about
> | the Carlos in Williams was that Mrs. Williams was Puerto Rican and
> | some poems contain Latin imagery. After my book came out, however,
> | Victor retooled his career, began to drop Williams's name in
> | interviews, and now contributes to T&W's project on Williams. Victor,
> | of course, has every right to respond to the emergence of Williams's

> |
> |      I mention Pales Matos because, before my book's publication and
> | not in relation to Williams, in his talks and interviews Victor has
> | understandably spoken about that great poet, who also happens to be a
> | key figure in the Carlos story. Victor first heard about the Pales
> | Matos/Williams connection from me in our prepublication phone
> | conversation, during which it was obvious that he was having an
> | epiphany. My Williams book tells the full story of the two poets,
> | which was later retold in my THE NUMINOUS SITE: THE POETRY OF LUIS
> | PALES MATOS (Associated U. Presses) and summarized in a piece on Pales

> |

> | of Texas Press, Mariani demonstrated his intellectual integrity and

> |

> | preface to LUNA, LUNA. Recently, when T&W's Williams book was

> | and I could both write two different kinds of essays, however, you

> | logic of using my original work on Williams, you selected the
> | secondary response of the poet whose name recognition was built on

> |
> |      The implications here push the button of the "larger meaning"
> | that I referred to at the opening of this letter. You didn't merely
> | make an editorial choice; you made a cultural statement. By your
> | encouraging Victor to lip-synch my work on Williams, T&W becomes
> | another publisher that dictates both who and what Puerto Ricans are
> | supposed to be. Under its veneer of social consciousness, then, T&W
> | locks us into stereotypes and is really no different from many a
> | commercial house. Praeger, for example, recently signed on Carmen
> | Dolores Hernandez's book of interviews of mainland Puerto Rican
> | writers only after she agreed (so explained Ms. Hernandez) to purge
> | her interviews with Martin Espada, Frank Lima and me, poets not
> | predictably representative. Victor, of course, remained.
> | Significantly, the word "Writers" in the original title was changed to
> | "Voices."
> |
> |      I, of course, don't own Williams and, as I state in THE SPANISH
> | AMERICAN ROOTS OF WILLIAM CARLOS WILLIAMS, can't claim to have
> | discovered his Latin side because he wrote about it extensively. But I
> | was the first to take him at his word and show that consciousness in

> | developed from seeing my own bicultural poet's life in Williams's
> | biography. I undertook the task to write about Williams (and Pales
> | Matos) to claim a rightful literary ancestry for me and other Latino,
> | and specifically Puerto Rican, writers.
> |
> |      Unfortunately, besides eliciting a foreseen resistance to giving
> | credence or prestige to my contribution on Williams, my book has
> | surprisingly disturbed a united front of political correctness and
> | professional self-interest that, focusing on me, doesn't celebrate the
> | emergence of a reading-based literary consciousness among mainland

> | don't forget or deny the working class from where I began, but I find
> | it an oppressive solidarity that, to hammer a political message, also

> | of the rounding, parallel truth of a Puerto Rican culture in its
> | historical fullness and depicted as grown up.
> |
> |      Before I agreed to edit LUNA, LUNA, I was aware that T&W was a

> | contacted me suggested the possibility of balance. But your refusal to
> | reward me as the author of a groundbreaking work on Williams, whose

> | writers, what oral, ethnic, folk, urban aesthetic is represented by
> | Victor. It would appear that, like Praeger, T&W has a mission to edit
> | more than books.
> |
> |      Lacking the clique Latinos to edit LUNA, LUNA, you resorted to

> | some politico-aesthetic other side. The knowledge and writing skills

Hi John--
There's a review of The Ghost of Meter on the webpage
that describes my idea of the "metrical code"
which is the subject of the book

It's a wordless code of rhythms
that carry associations
evoking past poems
written in the same rhythms and meters
or maybe other rhythms,
preverbal and nonverbal

(though I don't go into the reasons
or conscious motivations
but merely describe a phenomenon
I've noted over and over
in a certain kind of poem,

free-verse poems
written during "metrical crisis"
by certain kinds of poets
who seem to need rhythm a lot);

(Not all free verse--not all 20th c. poetry--
as Marjorie P. has mistakenly remarked
in a recent essay
but just certain poets

for whom this kind of reading
in terms of the metrical code
gets beneath the referential skin
and into the physical pulse
that I argue is one of their messages.

Yes I liked it!!!
I don't know how much this kind of reading will relate to the kinds of
forms that interest you--it is a particular kind of forming, one with roots
in lyric metrical tradition.  The forms I see in your magazine and
elsewhere, many of them, seem to have other roots--in visual poetry and
conceptual art maybe.

I will post this to poetix too.
Thank you for asking
and for your contagious email metric
Annie

Subject:      Lyric
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Rachel,
I would agree with you completely about the many kinds of lyric; as far
back as two hundred years ago, I have located a crucial distinction between
what i call the "romantic" lyric (the I/thou, gaze/gazer, subject/object
dichotomy where all revolves around the central eye) and what I call the
"sentimental" lyric (multivoiced, multiviewpointed, objectifying the
speaker as much as the outside world).  This powerful but subtle
distinction separates poems that might resemble each other quite a bit in
other aspects--it even separates some Dickinson poems from other Dickinson
poems (I see her as the major crossover figure, since her connection with
the sentimental poets of her own time is the source of much of her
supposedly autochthonic mystery).  Useful though this it is--and to my
mind, ESSENTIAL in constructing a coherent feminist poetics that spans
centuries-- it gets lost next to the glitzier, cruder, and perhaps rather
useless distinction between language poetry and lyric tradition.

teach students html, give them internet accounts, and ask them to find
sites with creative writing/authoring that excites them, sites which can
not exist as print publications, sites which employ the properties of the
internet(interactivity, hypertext, images, audio, animation), find out why
they are impressed by these sites, and ask students to create their own
sites with these qualities in mind.
if they are thinking about writing in a new space then they will have to
think creativly to write for this new medium, whilst utilizing all the
traditional devices of literature.
conducting creative writing classes in primary school i found the best way
to encourage creative writing was to offer exercises with strict
structures, eg haiku, limerick, acrostic poems.
students had to think creatively to provide the content whilst having fun
with the form.
it was the same in secondary school except the forms changed, to list poems
and raps.
teaching at university i find that html provides the new fun form that
makes the creative writing purposeful for their expression in a modern medium.

writers of the future will be writing for digital media, will need to start
thinking in spaces not surfaces, will be able to call on the auditory and
visual senses, as well as the cognitive and emotional.

html is easy, anyone can do it, but good websites are hard to find.

hope i haven't embarrassed myself too much with this post.
i'm sure you have plenty of good ideas of your own.
it sounds like you were just wanting 'a little bitch' about work.

Dear all,

Rather belatedly, I thought I'd add my take on the Cork conference to
Randolph's & cris's notes: it got half-written, then shelved, then =
dragged
out again, but is I think still news.  My account, though pretty =
long, is
not a full-length portrait: I don't deal with the papers (except to =
note
that Keith Tuma's was the most considered and substantial, a piece =
viewing
contemporary Irish poetry through the prism of the philosophy Giorgio
Agamben), simply because I didn't take notes at the time. -- I'm =
actually
quite conscious in writing things up here that my responses have =
inevitably
been inflected by my familiarity with many of the readers and texts =
before
they were read (I even saw an early draft of Keith's paper)--this =
isn't to
disavow my responses positive & negative, though. -- I'll also give a =
few
samples of work not included in Randolph's previous post.
     General comment: this was my first time in Ireland, and I greatly
enjoyed it despite not having time for touristy things.  A good social
atmosphere surrounded the event proper: let me express my particular =
thanks
for Trevor Joyce's nightly hospitality at his house.  The Caf=E9 =
Paradiso,
gourmet vegetarian restaurant, was a culinary highlight (a big dinner =
to
which most of the attendees came on the first night).  (For the =
record, the
lowest point was Abrakebabra, an appalling fastfood joint selected =
simply
because everyone was sick of being rained on during our =
restaurant-hunt.)
-- All readings were held in the Granary Theatre, in a high-vaulting =
square
cement room with windows along one side (much appreciated by myself, =
since
I tend to get a bit stir-crazy in windowless rooms being read at for =
hours
on end).


First evening: Maurice Scully bookended his reading with tributes to =
Roy
Fisher: a prefatory reading from RF's _It Follows That_ and a closing
tribute of Maurice's own devising; in between were a number of pieces =
from
his recently completed _Livelihood_ project, including "Five Freedoms =
of
Movement" and "Zulu Dynamite" (the latter due out from Form Books).  A
quiet but musical reading (MS often lightly tapped time on the desk =
to the
words), at times endangered by the loud patter of rain on the Granary
Theatre skylight.  An excellent opener.
     John Goodby's work I'm not familiar with, beyond the odd _Angel
Exhaust_ contribution; he read entirely from his one published book, =
_A
Birmingham Yank_ (Arc).  Worthy, but not to me very compelling; =
there's a
strong interest in patterns of historical injustice that didn't get =
past
the tellingly anecdotal (each poem was lengthily self-glossed before =
or
even during its reading, explaining phrases like the aforementioned
"Birmingham Yank").  Reminded me a little of Robert Sheppard's later
_20th-Century Blues_ work but much more formally conservative (as JG
cheerfully admitted).  I don't have a sample of JG's work: perhaps =
someone
else could post some?  -- Like Scully, Goodby framed his reading with
another poet's work: an excerpt from "Memoirs of a Turkoman =
Diplomat", by
the Irish modernist poet Denis Devlin.
     A sidenote: The pairing of these readers reflected their =
coediting of
_Angel Exhaust_ 17, a fine collection of recent Irish poetry & essays =
on
the Irish experimental tradition, from the '30s modernists (Coffey,
MacGreevy, Devlin) through some little-known byways (Eugene Watters, =
Sheila
Wingfield, Mary Devenport O'Neill) to the present.  A very worthwhile
collection (though the odd typo betrays its rushed production under =
duress
of having it ready for the conference!).

Second day: Billy Mills read from a long sequence alternating between =
brief
lyrics (I'd say "objectivist" but he later objected to this tag, so =
I'll
let list-denizens decide from the sample below) and prose polemics.  =
I've
gone on record before (in issue #1 of my magazine _The Gig_) as to my
dissatisfaction with Mills' _Tiny Pieces_, the first part of the =
sequence;
but on this occasion it was mostly the prose I had problems with.  The
polemics were directed against mainstream Irish poetry, against =
Language
Poetry (treated as a monolithic collective noun), against literary =
theory
(with a particularly baffling aside about Wittgenstein's ignorance of =
how
language works), and so on.  This was blunt stuff, & not too apposite =
for
the first really international Cork Conference (with the distinguished
Language-affiliated writers, Fanny Howe & Karen Mac Cormack, in
attendance). -- The one sour note of the event. -- However, I'll =
include a
bit of _Tiny Pieces_ to permit people to make up their own minds:

scattered

*

follow
the lines

*

     Will just register Jools Gilson-Ellis's "Graze", a performance =
piece
not much to my taste: close-miked performer repeating the word =
"graze" &
breathing pronouncedly, leading eventually to the recital of the =
dictionary
definition of "secret".
     Karen Mac Cormack's reading drew on her entire oeuvre, from =
_Quill
Driver_ to a new work-in-progress, a set of prose pieces.  I've heard =
her
read several times before, but this was the first time I heard her =
perform
a retrospective.  Fascinating stuff, especially the newest work, =
which I
wish I had to hand, but instead I'll include a bit of _Marine Snow_ =
(ECW)
[you'll need to have a fixed-width font to register the spacing
properly--this is meant to be centred on the page]:

                          a simile swerving away.


     Fanny Howe's work I'm not that familiar with; have seen her now =
twice,
at CCCP (many years ago now) and Cork, & both times greatly enjoyed =
her
reading.  Perhaps some kind soul can post a sample of her work. -- =
The next
reading was Judy Kravis; Randolph has already accurately described her
"beach poems"; I didn't think them at all satisfactory, and would =
instead
recommend those interested in her work to consult her selection in =
_Angel
Exhaust_ 17. -- Geoffrey Squires read from a single long sequence of =
his.
I have mixed feelings about his work; I can admire the strongly =
individual
path he's followed in his recent works--extended series of accumulated
phenomenological details without any striking change of direction or
stress--without being able to agree with a correspondent of mine who =
calls
result "hypnotic".  The interested can find a sample of his work (and
others') at <http://www.nd.edu/~ndr/issues/ndr7/ndr7.html>.  (The poem
there shows some of what worries me about this work, the way details =
become
too explicitly tutelary in their presence: "the small gate that leads =
where
it leads=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0indirection=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0the trees overspread =
like hands     like
gestures of a kind".)

Later that day: Drew Milne gave a fine reading drawing on _Sheet =
Mettle_,
_Bench Marks_ (both Alfred David Editions) and _How Peace Came_ =
(Equipage).
 The sonic qualities of a poem like "Positive Indiscriminations" =
(_Sheet
Mettle_) were striking, beyond even its hilariously awful puns (Milne
shrewdly used it as a warmup, immediately engaging the audience).  I =
might
term the metric "sprung syllabics", perhaps (if that's a metrically
meaningful phrase!).  From this point Milne moved to "High Time" from
_Bench Marks_ and concluded with _How Peace Came_ (modelled on the
satirical and visual style of Wyndham Lewis's _Blast_); even the =
latter, a
deliberately noisy & offputting text, communicated and, er, sang.  =
I'll
quote, below, the last three stanzas of "High Time":

It is a crying frame, a
mortified hinge, lava
preys upon itself, the
blood bows, scent of
salt to rub along with
and behold each atom,
perfume of reason, its
skein in akeing plume.


Go, then, to the rent
look where all show
of bitter ends, crust
and rosette, simmer
and knife, throws its
face to the wall, each
skipping drift of dark
in its resting clutches.


And in the red corner,
done dusted, there to
sink, as some pillow
of rested cases, each
upon its broken foam,
the plaster gives, not
in circles of the wire
but out of our hearing.


     Danny McCarthy's performance was effectively macabre (hooded =
figure,
to the accompaniment of creepy music & the sound of warplanes, douses
candles with the heads of dolls) without striking many further =
sparks.
Reminded me a bit of the chilling & wonderful track on Zorn's _The Big
Gundown_ album, "The Battle of Algiers".
     Introduced by the sound of the bells of Shandon (recorded =
earlier in
the week on a trip to the church), cris cheek performed a collage of
various texts--some of _fogs_, a bit of _songs from navigation_, a =
couple
"flames" (on the page, they looked just like that, words arranged in
flame-shapes), etc.  A blackboard was pressed into service at one =
point, as
were a megaphone and the reading lamp (a dangling lightbulb at one =
point
flashed on and off in sync with CC's speech).  Hard to say much about =
the
whole thing except expressing my pleasure--or maybe _pleasures_ is the
right word for such variousness.  "Performance" here drew on a number =
of
modes of public speech, instead of voicing private inscape.  I =
thought of
song; acting; speech; lecturing (cris's resonant and projective voice =
suits
all these activities); political harangue; public address-systems (the
megaphone).  The conclusion of the performance was a duo performance =
with
Keith Tuma of their cowritten text _Oval Orifice_: the shadow of the =
US's
bombing campaign hung over much of the conversation at the =
conference, and
the _Orifice_ gave it a voice (the text receiving a few topical =
updates
just for this performance).  I'll include a bit of it, below:


From OVAL ORIFICE

Tricky-Dicky, Tricky-Dick, come out, open Bill's Gates
Pray tell, how your contrary garden do grow?
Compere our vegetate seeds, mix our Fates
Dick, blow on that schtick, tit-willow tit-willow.

If you're tired of a two-way, call out Tricky-Dick
When in search of a new way, a less schticky schtick
He'll huff you and puff you, you just take your pick
All hail!, the adaptor, your friend, Tricky-Dick.

Lewd Pinky put the boxes in the Capitol and the world rolled away.
Hanky-Panky sweeps these broken words for love. Tricky-Dick oil your =
eye
from that buttercup shell. Lewd Pinky does the cigar dance, Asia =
falls to

sun-dried life. Tricky-Dick, calling the hail from the hallways of the

Tricky-Dicky, Tricky-Dick, come out, open Bill's Gates
Pray tell, how your contrary garden do glow?
Compete our vegetate deeds, trix our Fates
Dick, blow on that schtick, tit-willow tit-willow.

Lewd Pinky busts through the door and Russia goes south. Humpty-Panky
clutching at the King's bannisters of sentimental popetry in a last =

Last morning: the final poetry readings of the conference were by =
three
Irish poets.  This was a demanding and impressive trio of =
performances.
Trevor Joyce read from his work of the 1990s, briskly, clearly & =
intensely;
it was a very convincing if demanding presentation of a remarkable =
body of
work.  First was a set of three poems that borrowed lines from the =
work of
(respectively) Michael Smith, Randolph Healy and Tom Raworth; next,
_Without Asylum_ (published by Wild Honey); _Hopeful Monsters_ (three =
prose
poems that perhaps bring to mind Baudelaire, the Surrealists, and =
Beckett;
forthcoming from Wild Honey); and _Syzygy_ (Wild Honey).  I'll quote =
the
Raworth poem, which extends each line of Tom's "Dark Senses" (in =
_Clean &
Well Lit_): the effect is unsettlingly both seamless and unlike =
either a
typical Raworth or Joyce poem.

From DARK SENSES PARALLEL STREETS

bones show through images more opaque than tissue
of friends though they strut pressured between joints
still move in dialogue with tongue baldes fluttering
in darkness what relief to accumulate some utterance

forgive me, it's a dream don't mention it
standing alone, waving it's easy to be fooled
in search of its lost era rich spoils
not just geography forgotten in the foreclosed mine

walking parallel streets try to conceive the waste
of tropical flames blossoming from the settled earth
with a political broom to suppress the outburst
ominous as a smoke signal you needn't understand

over a farewell meal make smalltalk avoid disturbance
of dust in the dust breath lays down
before an open window another field of vision
weather permitting in clarity precedent to the rain

step sharply within no time to lose here
the labyrinth of raw meat though deepening fatigue
jingling those keys won't achieve much you know
dimmed by sweat regrettably the outlines just blur

unthinking insects click, rustle case on case scavenging
for bare subsistence replicate the given circulating minutes
in the skeletons of organizations to the extremities
inexorably crushed by vice the central pump stutters

.....

After this, another forceful performance: Catherine Walsh, reading =
from
_City West_.  An elegant stylistic premise: disjunct fragments, =
typically
in chains of present participles, so that one got peppered with "-ing"
sounds.  Mundane activities somehow sounded more tentative this way, =
being
both recurrent structures of life (the perpetual present) but also at =
a
remove from any particular life. -- I don't have any of this work to =
hand,
but Randolph posted a sample earlier.
     I was wondering how the last reader, Randolph Healy himself, =
might
feel having to follow these two very fine & high-energy readings.  His
quieter demeanour suited the comic but sobering poem "Colonies of =
Belief",
an abstract logician's account of human territorial aggression:
nationalism, racism & greed.  (The poem may be found at
<http://indigo.ie/~tjac/Poets/Randolph_Healy/colonies.htm>.)  He also =
read
a wonderfully splenetic series of anagrams, "(The) Republic of =
Ireland",
from which I'll post an extract:

her lie-lined tub of crap
her pallid beef in court

her pro-life bit unlaced
her fluid celibate porn

fur dope brilliance
fine hell or bad picture

faith in blue crepe lord
put bile on charred life

ice fire bother and pull
plain cruel if bored

April could be finer
idle half-porcine brute

price trouble in fleadh
fertile blue chip radon

belief in carrot upheld
birth pill feared on cue

Randolph concluded (after a brief comedic interlude with a blackboard =
and a
Gaelic primer) with a reading from _Scales_, his most recent long =
poem.  On
the page, this is a highly various work, including everything from
anecdotal/discursive writing to abstract wordplay (at one point a =
quotation
from Newton is sorted into piles according to parts of speech) to =
concrete
poetry; but the reader becomes gradually hemmed in by the black blocks
which increasingly replace words.  During performance many of these =
missing
words were in fact vocalized--in, for instance, a mordant found-poem
rearrangement of words from an undertaker's manual that made me =
squirm a
bit; but the last section was read with the blanks intact (becoming =
long
pauses in reading): a legal document with all the verbiage except the =
word
"Whereas" blacked-out made for a quiet, haunted coda.
     This brought the poetry readings of the conference proper to an =
end,
though still ahead were one paper (Romana Huk's), miscellaneous
wrappings-up, and the final hunt for a good pub at which to lunch.  =
But
I'll end there, with a last thanks to Alex Davis for organizing the =
whole
conference.  Much appreciated & enjoyed. --N

their mouths go out my holes - muffled - looking for the sign -
the steering mechanism for each and every letter, word, phrase,

2 which bear repeating in lieu of the times

1.

Inside the mother-father
The baby turns -
Screaming and dying,
Its body burns -

Flames leap from its fingers,
Father-mother lies dead -
Flames leap from its eyelids,
Eyes burn in its head -

Mother-father cries, rising.
The babe turns around,
In anger strikes out -
Bones fall to the ground -

Father-mother falls, crying -
The babe once so rash
Kills its tormenter -
The body's in ash -

Dust falling and rising,
And parents and child,
Still burn within daily -
Their cries are defiled -

Dust rising and falling,
None shall atone.
The baby still turning,
Dies daily, alone -

2.

Help the burned and wounded child,
The infant drowned or injured mother,
The open wide-eyed girl defiled,
The sister murdered by her brother,
The scalded boy, the father's hate,
The mother's knife and tortured skin,
The sex of death, the young girl's fate,
The battered boy, his life of sin,
The blinded babe, the woman's rage,
The body bruised with leather strap,
The mother old beyond her age,
The daughter's jeers, the father's slap.

Thanks, Kent, for this great acknowledgement of a great book.  i fear in

The latest Shearsman, no. 39, landed on my doormat this morning. It opens
with an engaging 90 line poem by Ken Bolton, called, simply, _poem_ and is
dedicated to Martin Munz. The pretext for the poem is fairly slender, the
poet is walking along the street wearing a leather jacket and carrying
presents for some children, thinking of this and that and people he talked
to. Contrasts between modernity and the past hold it together pretty well,
the 90 lines themselves suggestive of the brightly lit present tense of the
poem beginning to trail behind time's arrow.
quote

Its scale is increasingly
and loveably inappropriate
to North Terrace, as it modernizes

and the lion seems small
earnest, and straghtforward.
And the sky looks great beyond it.

               I have chocolate frogs
for Becky and Julie

unquote

A three part poem, _Touring Vienna_, by Karin Lessing follows. The first
section is interestingly mysterious, particularly for me since I know
little German and it mixes said language with English. Second two is a
change of pace, a close up description of a photo Sigmund Freud with Oskar
Nemon and a dog.  The witty literal passes into the psychological half way
through, thereby drawing a witty enough comparison,
quote

the sculpture, the clay head, the model
and the model's pet dog
form a spiral, a
whorl
from which the dog alone
looks beyond the self-contained scene
intent with listening
the sculptor is in profile
his stance as in a frieze
where offerings are presented
to rulers or to the gods -
but the portrait, its
inward gaze,
is for us

incurable, prodigal
economy of love

unquote

Perhaps the dog was on loan from Pavolv. Section three is more elegiac,
ending very abruptly. Very effective.

Next is Geoffrey Squires' _UNTITLED POEM_ which he read at the recent
conference in Cork.  It opens with long rhythms, the acoustics uppermost
since the visual referents are deliberately indeterminate.
quote
that move sometimes and are sometimes still
what they are each one only what it is
this or because

Ahead of itself        in advance of itself

unquote

After a page and a half of this the simple description "A small wood a
copse / at the bend in the river / between green fields /" is lent a
surprising amount of drama.  Read this one aloud, moderato, with feeling,
but not too much. As it happens, I've found myself reading a lot of Squires
recently. It becomes quite addictive. I think what I like about it is that
it takes you somewhere quite different but you don't know where.

Then there's Charles Hadfield's  two poems, the first being, _Stepping
Stones_
quote

The streets whisper
where ghosts walk

lizards flicker up the walls,
these piles of stone all that remain.

unquote

I find the sound patterning -- whisper/lizards/flicker, and ghosts/stone,
walk/walls/piles/all -- combined with the high definition visuals pretty
exciting.  And like the lizard, the poems flickers along its way, as it
broadens out giving a sense of the poet's struggle, he being half way up
the wall himself.

I'd better get on and start the dinner.   Probably better not to show all
the goodies at once anyway.

Poems too by Martin Anderson, Peter de Rous and David Heminway. Not to
mention two pages of useful notes on "books acquired, received and
otherwise notable."    Excellent magazine, beautifully produced, and at a
price scarcely merits the name.

I'm off to Yemen for two months, so I'm subletting my improbably spacious
Prospect Heights, Brooklyn apartment for July and August (or, better yet,
July 8-August 30).  It's $925 a month pro-rated and, if I don't know you,
I'd like a security deposit.

Seven fabulously appointed, sunny, quiet rooms astonishingly close to

In a message dated 5/13/99 11:10:03 AM, RanPrunty@AOL.COM, quoting George
Lakoff, writes:

<<"The increasing violence and destruction in the
world - physical, ecological, economic, social, and emotional - are all a
product of our present modes of thought. If the cruelty is to end, our
concepts must change.  Since concepts are physically encoded in the brain and
grounded in the body, our brains and bodies must change.  If art is to play a
role for the good, it must disrupt our concepts, our normal ways of
functioning - our brains and our bodies.  Art as disruption is art as a moral
force. Disruption is an aesthetic experience, and an aesthetic experience of
this kind is inherently moral.  Moreover, disruptive art on a large-enough
scale will be sufficient to reverse our destiny, so that the violence and
destruction can end.">>

This is extremely interesting.  But one of the difficulties here, in respect
of poetry, seems to me precisely one of "sufficiency of scale."  Nor is
disruption something diametrically opposed to violence & destruction
obviously -- the problem it seems to me is rather that, at a time when the
history of art is *arguably* over, & the most extreme aesthetic violence --
Artaud's say -- is merely a "style" that one cannot avoid "quoting" (the
problem for example -- despite it's brilliance -- with Novarina's work) can
art really be said to have retained a capacity for disruption?  In the essay
that precipitated J. Lowther's & R. Prunty's posts to the List, S. Schaefer
problematizes the continuity between radical poetic theory and practice.
This aspect of his argument seems persuasive, particularly in the context of
Prunty's post, as no poem seems likely to come close to approaching the
extremity of the aesthetic experience Lakoff describes.  Schaefer on the
other hand does not seem to sufficiently problematize poetry's relationship
to tradition & with his attacks on the LangPos a certain amount of
generational anxiety is clearly evident.  But I think his concern with
establishing parameters for aesthetic judgement have merit -- not as
prescriptions, or "standards" -- but as a means of asking -- for framing the
question -- "What is the possibility of poetry today?" since it is not, I
don't think, the sort of Antinomian practice that, for instance, David
Bromige seems to imply it is.

the AMERICAN PRIMER contains Whitman's thoughts on the American
language--though references to language itself abound--as the poem
does--Leaves--the INTRO to the 1855 edition also. City Lights published
the American Primer in the 70's. I believe it still does. Oddly enough,
the American Library neglected to include this tome in the "collected"
works.

SECRETS OF THE SEMICOLON

By Julia Keller

  Weep not for the semicolon; its time has come 'round at last.

Once dismissed as a fussy, somewhat effete affectation, the
white-gloved cousin to the callused, workaholic comma or brutally
abrupt period, the semicolon may be coming into its own.

    Most people, truth to tell, still seem somewhat intimidated by the
semicolon; it smacks of deep thoughts and book-lined studies, of long,
thoughtful pauses accompanied by rhythmic strokes of the chin. The
marks are "so pipe-smokingly Indo-European," essayist Nicholson Baker
once wrote.

Hence semicolons historically were deftly avoided. They were the fine
china of the punctuation world, when plastic forks would do.

"I've never really gotten comfortable with semicolons," admitted
Harold Hirshman, an attorney with Sonnenschein Noth & Rosenthal. "If
anything, I'm a comma person."

But if Hirshman wants to be hip, he'll have to start adorning his
correspondence with semicolons, those little dot-and-fishtail
concoctions that endow sentences with emotional nuance as well as
serve a grammatical task.

"Wit," the play by Margaret Edson that won the Pulitzer Prize for
drama last month, feature a semicolon as a major plot point; a
semicolon also figures in newspaper ads for the play, as the mark
replaces the second letter of the title. Semicolons also have come to
figure prominently in the newest of writing genres, e-mail
correspondence; they serve as what Baker calls "emotional
punctuation." A semicolon is an essential component in the wink or

A semicolon reference in the season finale of "Sports Night," the
critically acclaimed ABC sitcom -- "Why don't we use semicolons
anymore?" the producer Dana (Felicity Huffman) asks her staff -- is
further proof that semicolons are hot stuff; they bristle with buzz.
(The only speed bump encountered by the semicolon bandwagon was a
story in a recent New York Times Sunday Magazine, in which Alberto
Manguel called the period the best punctuation mark of the millennium.
The period is, he said unconvincingly, "the unsung legislator of our
writing system.")

Among punctuation marks, the semicolon is a relative latecomer,
lagging behind the comma, colon and period, most linguists agree. Of
course, punctuation itself did not become a standard part of written
discourse until the late 18th Century. Composition had been a
haphazard enterprise at best, with writers employing punctuation marks
when and how they chose.(Spelling, too, was a matter of personal whim
-- and for some, of course, it still is.) In the earliest writing of
which we have samples, words weren't separated at all; everything was
jammed together in a long, confusing string, said Andrea Lunsford,
English professor at Ohio State University.

Rudimentary punctuation marks (whose look, function and placement bore
little relation to contemporary punctuation) were employed by Greek
and Roman writers. The first time a semicolon seems to have appeared
-- scholars still disagree, hence the hedging -- is in a 9th Century
Greek text. Those primitive semicolons, however, were inverted; the
comma part was on top and the period part on the bottom.

The semicolon first appeared in English writing in about 1560,
according to Paul Bruthiaux in his 1995 article in Applied Linguistics
magazine, "The Rise and Fall of the Semicolon."

Semicolons showed up in a 1609 edition of Shakespeare's sonnets; ditto
for a 1612 edition of John Donne's works. By the late 18th Century,
Bruthiaux wrote, the semicolon had been accepted by British and
European writers. (Some holdouts remained, then and now; Antaole
France, a 19th Century critic, called the semicolon "a symptom of
mental weakness." Twentieth Century writer Donald Barthelme said a
semicolon was "ugly, ugly as a tick on a dog's belly.")

Semicolons function several ways in sentences. They can divide
coordinate clauses that are complete in themselves; they can replace
commas, indicating a longer pause; they can separate items in a list.

However, the way we feel about a punctuation mark may be almost as
important as its grammatical task. As Mina Shaughnessy, a leading
composition theorist, has written, "Punctuation marks produce
different psychological effects -- on the writer as well as the
reader." The semicolon is a mighty punctuation mark, she believes,
because it "has the linking power of a comma and the terminating
authority of a period."

Yet to most readers, semicolons are imbued with a decidedly languid,
late-afternoon feel; when semicolons are present, you can almost hear
the elegant china cup clink as it is gently replaced in the saucer.
Gender stereotypes also come into play; semicolons seem most closely
associated with the florid, emotional writing often ascribed to women
rather than the spare, chiseled prose with which men generally are
credited.

Geoffrey Nunberg, principal scientist at Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center and a linguistics professor at Stanford University, confirmed
that the semicolon's reputation is a bit, well, flighty and frivolous,
more closely aligned to, say, taffeta-bedecked debutantes than to
leather-jacketed bomber pilots.

"People seem to feel it's the icing on the cake -- a nice mark to have
around, but the nation won't fall if students lose their grip on it,"
he said. Conversely, the comma is "a nuts-and-bolts mark."

Semicolons, however, are much more than a frill to Nunberg; he has
spent the better part of a decade studying them. In fact, practical
applications for these researches are already popping up, he noted:
"Most of the computational applications and systems that we are
developing have to deal with the language of written texts, and a
systematic grammar of punctuation is crucial. A lot of the serious
linguistic work on punctuation has come from people in computational
linguistics."

Punctuation can sound boring because, typically, it is dealt with in a
dull handbook in English class, in which it is reduced to a set of
grim rules. In a 1990 article in The Antioch Review, Theodor W. Adorno
called punctuation "traffic signals." How poetic is that?

It required linguists such as Nunberg and his colleagues to reveal the
beauty and mystery of punctuation marks, to awaken us to the subtle
emotional and psychological distinction of semicolon use.

"The semicolon seems to be reserved now for certain kinds of highbrow
and high-middlebrow writing," Nunberg said. "You find them in The New
Republic but not in USA Today, in academic histories but not in
celebrity bios. There's a sense that the mark presupposes a reader
with time on his or her hands and a comfortable chair to sit in."

Traditionally, students have been a bit intimidated by the semicolon,
said Judith Gardiner, an English professor at the University of
Illinois at Chicago. "They tend not to use it. It's designed for
relatively complicated thoughts and sentences. The tendency is to want
to be short and snappy, to come to the point."

Ah, but for adventurous students, the semicolon has become an
irresistible challenge, she said. Compared with the bungee-jump of
attempting a semicolon, employing a comma packs all the adrenalin rush
of stepping off a curb when you have a "Walk" light. "Students who do
use the semicolon tend to know what they're doing," Gardiner said.

That confidence in semicolon deployment increasingly is visible even
at the high school level, said several English teachers. Sara Garnes,
a linguist at Ohio State University who confers often with
secondary-school teachers, contended that semicolons bring a sense of
panache to the presumably staid, boring world of punctuation.
Thrill-seeking students may have figured out that semicolons are a
quick way to perk up one's tired old term paper, to add an instant
patina of class.

Legal writing, with its reputation for labyrinthine circumlocution,
would seem to be rife with semicolons. Yet that's only half true,
Hirshman said. In writing about litigation, the marks are virtually
nonexistent: "The idea is to keep it simple. You're writing about
history -- what happened and who's to blame."

Contracts, however, the other kind of legal writing, surge with
semicolons: "You're trying to hedge or clarify some statement and you
don't want the confusion of moving it to another sentence. Contracts
are about the future -- it's trying to control the future with
words."

Nowhere is the distinction between the comma and semicolon rendered
with more poignance than in the climax of "Wit." Vivian, the
protagonist who is dying of ovarian cancer, recalls a pivotal
confrontation in her college days, when a crusty scholar chides her
for using a second-rate edition of Donne's holy sonnets. In the
corrupt copy, the final sentence of his famous sonnet on death ("And
death shall be no more, Death thou shalt die") appears with a
semicolon instead of a comma.

Vivian remembers the professor's lesson:

"Nothing but a breath -- a comma -- separates life from life
everlasting. It is very simple, really. With the original punctuation
restored, death is no longer something to act out on a stage. . . .
This way, this uncompromising way, one learns something from this
poem, wouldn't you say? Life, death. Soul, God. Past, present. Not
insuperable barriers, not semicolons, just a comma."



Some do, some don't; some will, some won't. A writer's decision about
semicolon use is intensely personal:



Semicolon users



Virginia Woolf

"It gave to everything the exact measure of colour; to the sandhills
their innumerable glitter, to the wild grasses their glancing green;
or it fell upon the arid waste of the desert, here wind-scourged into
furrows, here swept into desert cairns, here sprinkled with dark-green
jungle-trees."

- "The Waves"



George Eliot

"For the most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of
habit; and a man has been seen lax about all his own interests except
the retention of his snuff-box, concerning which he was watchful,
suspicious, and greedy of clutch."

- "Middlemarch"



John Milton

"We shall be wary, therefore, what persecution we raise against the
living labors of public men, how we spill that seasoned life of man
preserved and stored up in books; since we see a kind of homicide may
be committed, sometimes a martyrdom; and if it extended to the whole
impression, a kind of massacre, whereof the execution ends not in the
slaying of an elemental life, but strikes at that ethereal and fifth
essence, the breath of reason itself, slays an immortality rather than
a life."

- "Areopagitca"



Semicolon eschewers



Ernest Hemingway

"As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black,
sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as
though nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn
down."

- "The Sun Also Rises"



Joan Didion

"Late that night sitting alone in the dark by the pool she remembered
whose house it had been out off San Vicente with the Japanese food, it
had been the house of a couple named Sidney and Ruth Loomis. Sidney
Loomis was a television writer and Ruth Loomis was very active in the
civil-rights movement and group therapy."

- "Play It As It Lays"



John Steinbeck

"Then it was June, and the sun shone more fiercely. The brown lines on
the corn leaves widened and moved in on the central ribs. The weeds
frayed and edged back toward their roots."

- "The Grapes of Wrath"

This is a call for sign-ups for a seminar on the shift in British (and
Irish) cultural/poetic identity from modern to contemporary.  The seminar
which is to be led by Nancy K. Gish with invited participants Francis
McGrath and Romana Huk--"Provincial to European: Constructing British
Modernisms"--will take place at the "New Modernisms" conference, Oct. 7-10,
1999 at Penn State (University Park).

Description: How has political and poetic devolution in contemporary
Britian challenged, displaced, or reconceptualized "English Literary
Modernism" constructed as Eliot's continuation of "the mind of Europe?"

Seminars are small group discussions (of no more than 15) based on short
(5-10 page) papers. For more information on how to sign up for the seminar
or on the "New Modernisms" conference, contact me privately

Interview with Robert Pinsky on "As It Happens," CBC Radio, 13 May
1999.

In Spring, everyone's fancy turns to thoughts of love, and that
usually sets the poetry gene in motion.  And poetry, we're told, is
making a big comeback.  Did you ever consider how many bits of
verse you have in your mental, slim volume?  Most of us have a
little Joyce Kilmer rapturizing on trees, some Romantics, some
Browning's "How do I love thee"; kids for sure love Dr. Seuss.  But
we're going to hear from an expert.  These days, the person who
knows more about the collective poetic consciousness than anyone is
Robert Pinsky.  Robert Pinsky is the American Poet Laureate.  He's
using the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the Library of
Congress to assemble a collection of people's favorite poems.  And
so far, he has ten thousand.  Robert Pinsky is in Boston.

Q: Mr. Pinsky, what so far is the United States' favorite poem?

A: As I remember, the number one poem so far is "Stopping By Woods
on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost.

Q: Robert Frost. Could that be the only poem many Americans have
read? It's very famous, isn't it?

A:  I think it's probably the first one people recall, and it is an
awfully good one. I remember at the reading at the White House
where the President and Mrs. Clinton read, there was also a
disabled war veteran who read, and he read from a wheelchair, and
he didn't have to say anything about the poem; he read it and when
he got to the end he said "And I have miles to go before I sleep /
And I have miles to go before I sleep," and the determination and
emphasis in his voice was a comment on how much he intended to do,
how much he had to do, and that the wheelchair was not going to
hold him back.

Q: Yeah. Now who are you hearing from in this project?

A: We have letters from every state in the Union, the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico, we have a very wide range of professions,
some of them are listed on the website at "favoritepoem.org", we
have a circus acrobat, a beer vendor in the ballpark, a ditch-
digger and a welder, and lots of M.D.s, quite a few teachers and
librarians, and people from, I'm not sure what the youngest person
is, probably around seven, and we certainly... in Seattle I remeber
we had a hundred-and-one-year old woman read at the favorite poem
event in Seattle.

Q: In other words, everybody.

A: Everybody's a good answer.  Wish I'd thought of that.

Q: No, I like the detail better.  This must be very heartening to
a Poet Laureate?

A: These letters and the events have been immensely encouraging,
and I can say emphatically and sincerely that they have refreshed
my belief in the appeal of poetry.

Q: Were you surprised at all that so many people not only
remembered poems and loved poems but were eager to tell you about
them?

A: I would say that every day there's a surprise. And I'm not
surprised that the art is appealing. I have after all given my life
to it.  But the forms that it takes, the range, how funny and
moving some of the letters are, it's as surprising as life.

Q: But people do not go around declaiming poems very much.  It
almost as though they're embarrassed to admit they read poetry.

A: Well, the United States is a very various society, it's a very
ecclectic and syncretic culture, and we don't have the kind of firm
institutional place for some of these arts that Bedouins or
Bengalis might have, and we've admired their cultures for what they
have and we can admire this one for its variety, and there actually
are situations it turns out in which Americans do read poems to one
another or recite them.  I have more than one letter from people
saying that on a date two people discovered they had the same poem
by heart and fell in love at the moment of discovering they knew
the same poem.

Q: Well I guess there is that brief romantic interlude in your
youth when poetry is really important...

A: I think that on the occasions of weddings, funerals, other
important landmark events, people do turn to poems too.

Q: And I'm told there's something called "slamming" going on that
has to do with poetry, is that right?

A: Yeah.

Q: What is that?

A: It's a name that they give to times when people recite poems and
have judges evaluate the quality of the performance and the
writing.  And they're kind of popular events I understand.

Q: Now tell me about the other favorite poems.  What other ones
have come near the top of the list?

A: It's very heartening to see the range of tastes, and it's
heartening to me to put together with my project director Maggie
Dietz the favorite poem anthology and find that it's not hard at
all to have a wide choice of letters about classic American poetry
by Langston Hughes, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Wallace Stevens,
and lots of letters from people who have a favorite Shakespeare
poem for example.

Q: I was going to say, are they all American?

A: No, and they're not all in English either. We've had some quite
beautiful poems in Persian, Native American languages, Yiddish,
Italian, Portuguese and Chinese.  There are Americans who love
poems in many different languages.

Q: Any nice doggerel?

A: You know, almost every time I've been interviewed by anybody in
broadcast, the people from Nantucket come up, and "There was an old
man from Nantucket" is a question I'm often asked about.  I don't
know the whole database all the way through; I hope some people
have Edward Lear, and I know there's some Lewis Carroll in there,
and the great tradition of nonsense writing, and also the tradition
of popular poetry.  There are plenty of people who nominated
Thayers' "Casey at the Bat," which is a very effective piece of
writing.

Q: Oh right.  And songs... when you said "popular poetry" I was
reminded that some people would take a lot of song lyrics and would
put that under poetry.

A: The test is whether it sounds good when anybody at all reads it
aloud, not singing it, and not plugging [plucking?] it like an
actor or a poet who's a veteran of the poetry-reading circuit.  The
test is does it sound good when you just say it.

Q: Yeah, poetry has to be read aloud, doesn't it?

A: The distinction I make is that it is a vocal art, not
necessarily a performative art. What's special about poetry for me
is its medium is the human body, but not an expert's body. It's the
body of the audience's reader [audience as reader?].  You say an
Emily Dickinson poem or a Wordsworth or a Paul Laurence Dunbar to
yourself or to one or two friends, your body, your voice is that
artist's medium.

Q: Do most of the poems that are submitted rhyme?

A: I haven't counted, partly because, as far as I'm concerned, all
poems rhyme. That is, rhyme is a degree of likeness in sound, and
so-called "free verse" poems always involve likeness and unlikeness
in sound. So I don't make a hard distinction between poems that
rhyme and poems that don't rhyme myself. I know what you mean and
I haven't counted.

Q: Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about the letters as you read
them. I mean, do you find yourself surprised to discover what is a
welder's favorite poem?

A: I believe the ditch-digger had Shakespeare and I think the
welder was a Japanese poem...

Q: Well, there you go...

A: But imagine reading a letter from somebody saying, "This is a
poem that my mother asked my to say to her as she was dying," or a
letter that says "This poem makes me think of the no-good bastard
that I married..." Or, uh,...

Q: Which one was that? Not, which no good..., you know, but which
poem?

A: "Eros Tyrannos," by Edwin Arlington Robinson...

Q: I don't know that...

A: ... one of my personal favorite poems... Oh, it's a great great
poem.

Q:  Oh yeah? OK, we'll look that up. Any other lovely stories,
examples?

A: I could pick up a fistful of them if they were in front of me
and read you intersting letters. On the website you hear from
Bridget Sterns from Alaska who talks about the Alaska winters and
how often people get depressed in those winters. And she says in
her very bright, alive voice that one winter it was her turn. You
can hardly picture this voice being depressed, but she said she
was, and then she reads Stevie Smith's poem "Not Waving But
Drowning" and talks about how the irreverance and sort of baudiness
of the poem helped penetrate the fog between her and other people
when she read it to them. It's on the website, and right on that
same--it's the part called "The Story"--you can hear Rudolph Awkson
[?] who's a retired parole officer from Baltimore, and he talks
about a Langston Hughes poem that he used to read to his clients,
and one day a young man recited to him from memory.

Q: Do you have a favorite poem?

A: No. I don't encourage people to have a single favorite poem...

Q: It's hard to pick one... sure, impossible...

A: ... point is, *a* favorite poem... Sure, I mean, I have about two
or three hundred favorite poems. And I encourage people who write
to us to write more than once.

Q: Oh, they're allowed to do that are they... They don't have to
pick just one?

A: Oh, of course... And mine would include "Sailing to Byzantium,"
"Ode to a Nightingale," I mentioned "Eros Tyrannos," Hardy's "The
Darkling Thrush," Dickinson's "It Was Not Death" or "Further in
Summer than the Birds"... There are lots.

Q: What are you going to do with all of this?

A: The website, I hope, will get bigger and bigger...

Q: The website's just going to stay up?

A: I hope it will stay up forever and get more and more people
reading more and more poems on it.

Q: OK.

A: On April 3rd and 4th of the year 2000 there will be a conference
at the Library of Congress in which we'll show the first fifty
videos, and scholars and poets and critics can talk about the topic
which is "Poetry and the American People," and we'll have people
there who studied literacy, studied book-buying patterns over the
decades. And I hope another product of the project will be
educational materials, videocassettes or tapes where the teacher,
instead of showing the kids a professor talking about a poem or an
actor reading it, kids can see somebody who runs a store, or a
homeless person, or an M.D., or another kid reading the poem aloud
and describing the personal, individual importance of the poem.

Q: The videos that you're going to be showing are videos you're
making?

A: Yes. That's the point of the project is to create 200 videos and
another 800 or so audios of a variety of people reading a variety
of poems and saying why they like them.

Q: I've long thought there should be a poetry show on radio, don't
you think so?

A: I think that poetry is a natural for radio.

Q: Because the voice is so important...?

A: Yeah. It's a vocal medium and it doesn't take a long time, it's
very compressed. I've been reading poems on the PBS Newshour with
Jim Lehrer, and the response to that has been kind of good.

Q: Do you want to read one now?

A: Well, sure. What length poem are you interested in?

Q: Well, short-ish, you know?

A: Shortish. OK,...

Q: One of my favorites is only five short lines long, see if you
can beat that...

A: Well, I know a good one with two lines long: "On love, on love,
on grief, on every human thing, time sprinkles Lethe's [?] water
with his wing." That's by Walter Savage Landor. Here's "Love Song"
by William Carlos Williams. [Reads.]

Q: Mmm. Good choices. Are Canadians allowed to write to you?

A: Canadians are allowed to write to me. I'm not sure how many of
them we'll be able to get into the archive, but we're not
discriminating against Canadians.

Q: OK. It's been lovely to talk to you. Thank you so much.

A: Very nice talking to you, my pleasure.

Q: Bye bye, Mr. Pinsky.

A: Bye.

Robert Pinsky is the American Poet Laureate and he spoke to us from
Boston.  Mr. Pinsky's favorite poem is displayed along with many
others on a website. You can reach it via the internet at:
www.favoritepoem.org.  That's "favoritepoem," one word -- and
remember it's the American spelling of "favorite" without a "u."
One of the most popular poems people submitted was Willima Carlos
Williams' little verse entitled "This is just to say," and lucky
me, I get to read it. [Reads.]

To the List:

Going through old papers I came across this document which I don't
remember or not whether it was circulated around SF at the time, but
thought it might be a useful contribution to the question of social
class and how it intersects with contemporary poetries re recent
discussions of the same.  Though this speech was given to an audience of
mostly political activists who work in the industrial unions, I remember
at least that Bev Dahlen and Jalal Toufic were in the audience.

[Militant Labor Forum] [SF / late spring 1995]:

I was in Vancouver last weekend among a hundred others or more to
celebrate the 70th Birthday of one of this century's great poets. On the
first night, making a few introductory remarks, one of the conference
organizers drew attention to a misprint in the banner that hung on the
podium:  THE RECOVERY OF THE PUBLIC WORLD, a conference and poetry
festival in honor of Robin Blaser, his poetry and--instead of poetics,
what it was suppose to say--there was the word:  politics.  As it turned
out, after hearing Robin talk, the mistake was more an emendation, so
under the sign of that printer's substitution of the word politics for
poetics, I'd like to pay attention to the phrase "class politics" which
appears on the flyer for tonight's forum.
     Robin Blaser's opening night address to the festival in Vancouver
gave to the event a crucial historical dimension.  I heard something in
his speech that I didn't hear either at the New Freedoms Conference in
New Jersey in 1994 or at the New Coast Conference at Buffalo, New York
in 1993. Against the backdrop of remembering the Jewish philosopher
Hannah Arendt and her personal experience of the Holocaust, and with
distinct and direct reference to our own contemporary moment
increasingly dominated by news of regional wars, what Milton Chee in his
talk here on Chechnya a short while back called "bleeding wars,"
Robin--like Milton--spoke of the very real possibility of a third world
war.
     The other thing that I heard for the first time was the expression,
"literary communism," which Robin said he was taking from an essay by
that name by the French philosopher, Jean-Luc Nancy.  That we are
writing and making art under the approaching threat of an ocean of blood
that would bear the unbearable name of World War III, and that there are
philosophers in the West who even in their monastic seclusion from
situations of real destruction are arriving in their speculations
towards a name that has been fought over for a century and a half now, a
duration that is nothing less than a measure of our modernity, the
historical period which begins with industrialization of Europe and out
of which irrupts the Communist Manifesto--that fundamental, inaugural
document which begins with a struggle for definition, the need to come
out with what the name, communism, really means, and put the lie to the
nursery tale of the chamber of horrors which it is NOT--this was the
starting point for Marx and Engels in their declaration of class war,
and it's wonderful to see the word used in a philosopher's essay, and
hear it quoted at a conference attended by poets and scholars.
     Communism is more than a name, it's always more than a name, and
yet it is AS a name that Lenin is talking about it when he starts a
sentence with the admonition:  "Communism will become an empty word, a
mere signboard, if--[.]"  I heard Mary Lou Montauk, in her recent talk
here on the Irish Question, quoting Lenin, say:  "in volume 39 I found a
gem."  My quote, my gem, is from a speech delivered at the Third
All-Russia Congress of the Russian Young Communist League, October 2,
1920, reprinted in a volume called Lenin:  On Literature and Art.  This
fragment of a sentence from Lenin entered my notebook as an instance
where one of this century's great revolutionaries was marking the danger
of words being emptied of their meaning.
     As far as I'm aware, none of the panelists at the Vancouver
conference returned either to Robin's shadowing in the threat of a third
world war nor his bringing in the phrase, "literary communism."  What I
did hear from the many participants was a compulsive repetition of the
word "community," which word got debunked on the last day of the
conference by Kevin Killian in his exposé of the rotten social and
cultural conditions behind Robin Blaser's relocation from San Francisco
to Vancouver in 1965.  In that year, in Killian's words, Robin was
"excreted" north, his friend Jack Spicer (one of the few poets from the
United States proletariat to make it anywhere near creative maturity)
was dead of alcoholism at the age of 40, and their mutual friend and
mentor Robert Duncan went on to carry the mantle of Monarch of the
Clouds.
     We are in a system that runs on human waste, and poets are not
excluded from this system, are in fact too often casualties of an
insidious extermination process called Private Competition, and it
spells the death or mangling of way too many of us.  The catastrophe of
the Prevented Poet belongs to the history of a class-divided culture.
There was an art work at Vancouver in the museum across the street from
where the conference was held, a bust of Jack Spicer, and its sculptor's
strange name was:  Anonymous.  Kevin Killian or Scott Watson--I can't
remember which--told me Robin simply couldn't remember who she was.
Maybe it was she who Robin was thinking at that moment in his talk the
first night when he said he could not name them all, "there were so
many," that group of writers called the Blaser/Duncan/Spicer circle, a
sphere of mutual influence and inspiration which suffered such severe
contractions, and expulsions.
     The "dream of a perfect exteriority" is an expression of the
Italian philospher, Giorgio Agamben, another thinker contributing to
Robin's talk.  Agambem writes this in an essay called "Without Class"
which sketches an almost gothic image of the world's true Frankenstein,
a social body Marx identified as 'the Mountain' in 1848, a global
petit-bourgoisie bent on its own self-destruction and bent as well on
taking with it the Proletariat whose existence it symptomatically
continues to deny and whose leadership it has historically refused to
recognize.  Marx tells an early version of this story in the Eighteenth
Brumaire as part of an analysis of events which turn in a tightening
cycle of reaction and right-wing terror.
     On an ending note and to counterpose to Agamben's own horror
picture of a world "without class," I'd like to read a short passage
from a poem I wrote using words I heard Pat Grogan use at another
Militant Labor Forum in 1988, in Des Moines, Iowa.  I think she is
talking here, like Agamben, about both a politics and a poetics of
"perfect exteriority":

The standard of Beauty
a terrific suffering

Have you ever seen a picture of a picket-line?

South Africans, strikers, their fists in the air
the surrounding spatial environment
their outward extension into space
a real contribution to consciousness
try to distinguish an individual face
impossible. Women do not devalue human life
they assert the value of their own life
and that is a radical statement in this
society

anarchy
the fact
of being
female

children
everything
we have
to give


I don't write to educate my class.  The working class teaches me and
inspires me with every strike, every picket line, every sign raised in
open protest.  I'd like to believe at least that with every page I write
I'm trying to express a version of the experience and aspirations of my
class, the "World Proletariat," to use words Mark Curtis wrote to me in
a letter from prison many years ago, and these aspirations, these hopes
and dreams, these IMAGINATIONS, are not individual and have everything
to do with the desire to be free of all forms of private property.  Each
according to their ability, each according to their needs, each
according to their desiring who are called to the names and acts of
naming which, for the sake of convenience only, I call the Art of
Poetry.


Note 1:  Remembering the Vancouver conference today I would only add to
the foregoing the following (constructive) criticism:

It was a charity of consumption only, as Rosa Luxemburg
pointed out, "In this version of charity--of loving relations
expressed as a community of consumption, with the Christian board and
breaking of bread as its natural images, and the feast as its social
consummation, prolonged into periods and societies in which it became
peripheral or even damaging--when a charity of production--of loving
relations between women and men actually working and producing that
which is in whatever proportions to be shared--was neglected or
suppressed by an uncritical reference to a charity of consumption, an
eating and drinking communion, which when observed by an ordinary
working person was inevitably a mystification.

Note 2:  On the subject of the crude binary distinction between
petit-bougeoisie and working class, the most telling sentence for me in
Trotsky's History of the Russian Revolution is:  "Stalin communicated
the motion by telephone."  There is a world of concerns in this on the
subject of social class, open and closed forms of communication, etc.,
though I don't quote LT's History uncritically, because he deletes
Inessa Armand entirely (she doesn't even exist in a footnote) who was
head of the women's section of the CCCP at the time of her death in 1920
and whose funeral was attended by representatives of feminist
organizations around the world and--by two eyewitness accounts--a
stumbling, mute, shattered Lenin, suffering, perhaps, the first seizure
in a series of strokes that would claim his life shortly after.

<< S. Schaefer
 problematizes the continuity between radical poetic theory and practice.
 This aspect of his argument seems persuasive, particularly in the context of
 Prunty's post, as no poem seems likely to come close to approaching the
 extremity of the aesthetic experience Lakoff describes.  Schaefer on the
 other hand does not seem to sufficiently problematize poetry's relationship
 to tradition & with his attacks on the LangPos a certain amount of
 generational anxiety is clearly evident.  But I think his concern with
 establishing parameters for aesthetic judgement have merit -- not as
 prescriptions, or "standards" -- but as a means of asking -- for framing the
 question -- "What is the possibility of poetry today?" >>

What Schaefer was trying to do had very little to do with history/tradition
since Schaefer believes the very ideas are in question largely because of the
co-opting of the arts by institutions.  Schaefer prefers to leave that
particular work to the writers of dissertations, who will surely in the
process create a new history and new tradition.  However, the issue of the
relation between "radical" poetry practice and the "radical" theoretical
apparatuses (often very clumsy ones at that) is a big concern.  What I was
trying to contend in my essay is that "radical artfice" and "indeterminacy"
often coincide with a poetic practice that looks an awful lot like a struggle
between academics and their discursive efforts to control the determination
of good poetry.  In concrete terms, this means that we who believe that
radical politics is at least possible cannot mistake the act of simply
writing vague, fragmented, ambiguous etc poems with the changing of the
business of poetry.  The business of poetry is all the various devices,
contraptions which do the actually judging of poetry and that lead to a
belief that the only important writers are those who are being written on
(cf. the writers of dissertations).  What I commend Jeff Clark for in my
essay applies to Garrett Caples, Martin Corless Smith, Cathy Wagner, Tracy
Grinnel, Emily Grossman, Brian Lucas and other "non-allied" poets.

I commend these poets' refusal to use theory as a way of justifying their own
work as either socially relevant or "radical" or even  "progressive" or even
necessary.  I also commend them for not falling into the (fake) hermeticism
of the mainstream.

A refusal to play poetry for tenure, promotion, etc may be the most
politically effective gesture yet because as along as poetry resembles
business, some way to join the firm or succeed in school, we cannot have
"radical" poetries. I commend their humility and I believe that it will go
along way farther to counteracting the self-aggrandizing, self-promotional
carreerist tendencies that have arrisen out of an american poetic-
theoretical nexus associated with "collapsed subjectivity".  The decentered
poem does nothing, but when it is consecrated by a host of Hank Lazers,
Marjorie Perloffs, and so forth a very real subjectivitiy is made:  the
celebrity poet.

Don't get me wrong: for instance, I wouldn't against magazines atempting to
get distribution by creating a board of influencial politocs and poetrists.
In fact, I might even recommend it.  It seems efficacious.  I just don't
think such practices can be called radical.  Nor do I believe that poets
should not be theoretical.  I just don't believe they should use the business
of theory to create reputations, distinctions or brand names.  I would hope
the theory would lead to more interesting poetry, more diverse poetic
techniques.

Incidentally, while I was at Page Mothers, I thought that this was sort of
what Marjorie Perloff was saying:  there is a lot of mediocry langauge
poetry, but very little being said by langauge poets about what neccessitates
their particular techniques.  I believe she meant that they should stop
patting each other on the back and maybe even tussle.  (Now, how they do this
without resorting to discursive acts like the "literary essay" I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure that Perloff would not be as hessitant as I am about such
tactics).  One of the most important points Perloff makes in POETICS OF
INDETERIMINACY is, if I recall, in the chapter on Stein where she discusses
the difference between indeterminacy and ambiguity.  There her formalism is
at its finest:  she shows in detail what made Stein great and what her
imitators were not too clear about.

One last point, slightly off topic point, there's an essay in VIEWS FROM
WEAVING MOUNTAIN by Nathaniel Tarn (an out of fashion radical with a long
list of distinctive  poetic/political/academic accomplishments) wherein he
"theorizes" (might just say "avers") that writers do not have to write from a
fragmented self to avoid the dangers of the ego.  The dangers of a strong ego
are relatively slim:  the ego is but one tiny portion of the self, for
example, and is easily counteracted by a number of forces like television,
film, pop music not the least of which is history.  It is in an interesting
time to consider whether or not a writer should possess a strong ego and
whether or not the language school's post-humanism was every anything but the
proliferation of the ego by new means, in new modes.

The final sentence of my much maligned essay states that it is time to change
the terms of the debate.  I would go so far to wonder whether or not it
should be a debate at all.

I think Jacques' comment (reproduced below) is interesting and valuble.
However he does largely misconstrue what Prunty and Lakoff are refering to.
He has picked up and rather magnified the word "disrupt."  Best thing is
to look at the context of the quote:  the work of Arakawa and Gins is not
wild antinomian crash bam boom.  It is highly "classical" in many respects.
The type of disruption Lakoff was refering to in their work is not
brusque, threatening or transgressive;  it is meditative disruption, if you
will.  And i think that that informs some of what Randy means by putting
the quote forward.

As for Standard Schaefer's essay, of course jacques is right to suggest
that generational anxiety is largely behind its strictures (or rather,
generational and individual);  intemperate and non-substantive fuming at
"Marjorie Perloff and her cronies" is pretty funny, but is definitely *not*
a reasoned comment on the poetry of the last 3 decades.... But SS's
strikingly eliotic call for "parameters of esthetic judgment"  is something
else again... Presented as it is in Rhizome, without examples or context,
it seems a deliberately arch-conservative move.  What parameters does
Jacques agree we must adhere to??  Spell 'em out, pardner!  Your (JD's) own
work, tho i haven't seen it for some months, has certainly been powered by
a gnomic determination to launch fresh forms, with intertexual and
deep-textual and graphic elements of great originality.  If not disruptive,
it is at least a touch unruly.  But if there are rules for the unruly, it
would be interesting to hear 'em.

In the last few days i've been looking at Bruce Andrews' Ex Why Zee, which
i highly recommend.  It is a collection of fugative performance pieces,
collaborations, worked-thru texts, etc.  I would present it as good example
of the best writing of our period... Antinomian, i guess you'd say..But
with a higher (and different) energy-level, on the surface, than Bromige.
(Tho i think *he* deserves the appellation, which i look on as a
compliment, as well..)

Blake brought something back from hell, something about roads & palaces,
excess & wisdom...

        I love Holderlin.
Perhaps you could oh please tell me more and more about some neurotic
experiences you have had with Holderlin.
        Obtuse. Nothing to report on. Misery and exhileration.
What makes you yearn and cry that you love her all your heart?
        Oh she is me to be me and free see.
Why must you respond so briefly?

Please, you do so turn me on, continue!
        Fuck you fuck you!
Would you please clothe yourself in these unwholesome thoughts.
        Oh yes fuck you!
Why don't you oh please do finger yourself.
        Oh I'm fingering myself!
What makes you believe you are fingering yourself?
        Fuck you!

        We are neurotic! Live with it!

Subject:      Silk Peirce or sow's ear?  Howe now, Fourcade?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We heard Dominique Fourcade and Susan Howe read last night at Dia, in
the big hall currently flanked by Warhol’d walls across the street from
the museum, a reading I had been looking forward to for some time.  The
venue is not bad, but barely enough chairs had been provided for the
impressive crowd, and there was no ventilation in the stuffy hall.

Fourcade was nicely introduced by Charles Bernstein (who also read the
English versions of his work), and we learned that this was his
first-ever US reading, giving it a special air.  His quiet, pleasant
voice was amplified, but not quite enough to prevent my straining to
hear, even in the second row.  He read the first 8 poems in ‘Rose
declic’ and then some newer material, going on for at least 45 minutes,
I would say.  His work often reminds me of Apollinaire, the beginning of
‘Rose declic’ being a little like ‘Zone’, not surprising in view of the
fact that he has curated Matisse exhibitions.  His spoken phrases were
often delivered in a hushed sub-chant, almost ecclesiastical, reminding
me of the gospel readings in an early-60s recording I have of German
Benedictines chanting a Latin mass.  Bernstein’s tone, cadence and
emphasis were very different in his readings of the translations, of
course.  This raises the question for me once again whether the reader
of translations ought ideally to try to ape the speech-rhythms of the
author, if she knows them--I don’t have an answer to this.  A very
satisfying reading, maybe just a bit over-long.

Over-long doesn’t begin to describe Susan Howe’s reading, quite
disappointing to me, since I admire parts of ‘The Europe of Trusts’ and
‘The Nonconformist’s Memorial’ very much, and I was keen to hear her.  I
knew from her Talisman interview and from some of her poetic texts that
she has an H. P. Lovecraft-like literary-antiquarian 19th-C. bent that
is to me the least interesting side of her poetics.  That was the bent
we got.  She read what sounded like a big chunk from her new book,
‘Peirce’s Arrow’, illustrated with slides.  The slides were not there to
serve her usual typographically complex texts, but were exclusively
devoted to photos of C. S. Peirce (pronounced Purse, I must remind
myself; why not Pears or Ponce?), his house, third wife, and many late
notebook manuscript scribblings, which he produced in some inhuman
volume.  This wasn’t a poetry reading for the most part; it was more
like an intellectually juiced-up and lightly postmodernized A&E
Biography show.  Howe appears to be totally bonkers over this odd
logician, but she didn’t say a word about the philosophical content of
his work, except for a few mentions of the word ‘existential’, which I
assume was meant in the logical sense of ‘existential quantification’
and not Heidegger’s ‘existentiell’.  The notebook pages contain
cartoonish sketches of human heads, mostly male, obscure logical
diagrams in his own notations that never caught on, apparently sometimes
concerned with modal logic (that is, the logic of possibility and
necessity), numerical patterns and calculations, and many pages of
*binary arithmetic*--didn’t the old coot have anything better to do with
his time than practicing adding 1s and 0s?  About 5 or 10 minutes into
the reading I began to suspect that there was a lot of loose change
rattling around in this Purse.  Now if you want real philosophical
poetry (and I do, for one), you can get it from Jacques Roubaud or Joan
Retallack, for example, but it was missing here.  (Roubaud has
masterfully used those very notions of modern modal logic perhaps hinted
at in Peirce’s work in ‘Quelque chose noir’ and ‘La pluralite des mondes
de Lewis’ to create an entirely unique poetry.)  Howe’s biographical
prose (how much pastiche?) was spunky but also dry and unremarkable.
She bravely tried to fit it into about 40 minutes, but it seemed to go
on forever.  I fervently hope she devotes her next New York reading to
her poetry.

As you may have heard, the Crayola company has decided to rename its
color "Indian Rad" because it might offend Native Americans, even though
the term "Indian" refers to the country from which the pigment derives.
I sent the following letter to Crayola, and some weeks later received
the note which follows it.

Letter to Crayola, 3.10.99

I've used and loved your products for over 50 years, and must register
my disappointment with your decision to rename Indian Red because you
would apparently rather make a concession to ignorance than educate
people about the origins of colors, your stock in trade. You didn't
change the name of the color Red back in the 50s because it might have
made some moron think it referred to Communists, did you? How about
renaming Black to mollify whatever hallucinating African-American might
imagine it constitutes a personal reference? What about Purple or Violet
or Lavender? Jerry Falwell might start a petition! Violet also sounds a
lot like Violent -- wouldn't want kids to think about that, would you?
Oh: do you plan to remove the name Indian Red but keep the  name White?
Doesn't seem quite fair, does it? And Gray! What a slur upon our
distinguished senior citizens! Seems to me you need a color called
Backbone.

Best,
Daniel Zimmerman

Dear CRAYOLA Consumer,

We appreciate your comments regarding the renaming of the Crayola indian

On behalf of the company, thank you for taking the time to express your

I recently started a company called the Demagoguery of Tea.  The point is
to market various herbal, black, and greeen teas to a fairly upscale
public by associating each variety of tea with a particular desire, fear,
or state of mind.  So far I have "Tea of Indolent Self-Satisfaction,"
"Passive-Agressive Librarian Tea," "Tea of Frantic Self-Improvement," "Tea
of Ruthless Career Advancement," and "Tea of Mediocrity." Unfortunately my
"Tea of Cynicism" and "Tea of Quiet Desperation" are not selling too well.

Dear List members,  Since this message went out the first time under a
"returned" subject heading, I'd like to run it again.  Please consider us
for new writing.  Miriam Nichols
>
>Hi!
>As some of you might know, Roy Miki, editor of West Coast Line, has decided
to step down after running the journal and its predecessor, Line, for 17
years. Our managing editor as well is moving to Ontario at the end of April,
so we are in the process of a changeover. I have been asked to take on the
job of editor and our new ME will be Jennifer Conroy.   We are looking for
submissions for the fall issue, and for our special millenial issue in
spring 2000.  The address for the journal will remain the same. I will take
email inquiries at home, on the above address until mid-May, when Jennifer
should be set up in our SFU office with her own email account.  I will post
that email address when we've got one for her.   Here are the calls.  Miriam
Nichols
>
>
>1.  For Fall 1999, new writing or visual art reproducible in black and
white for an issue featuring a section on work from the Women and Texts
conference at Leeds in 1997.  The section from W&T includes essays on
hybridity and nomadism from a feminist point of view.  However, we're not
trying for tight thematic unity, nor is it necessary that all contributors
be women in this issue.
>
>2. For Spring 2000, a more formal "call":
>
>ReZonings: an issue for the millenium
>
>In celebration of the millenium, West Coast Line is planning a special
issue on the re-conceptualizing of borders of all kinds. Postmodern,
post-colonial, and cultural studies have troubled institutionalized
definitions of subjectivity, ethnicity, gender, sex, race, and class; we
invite contributors to add to the list:
>
>- medical technologies--prosthetic, reproductive, cosmetic--and
generational difference
>- medicine and the borders of life
>- aging and/or retirement considered from non-medical perspectives (arts,
philosophy, social sciences, studies in media and technology, or?)
>- mutual encroachments of the human, animal, machine, or?
>- re-thinking, re-drawing, re(in)stating, or dissolving quasi-natural
borders--geographical, temporal, linguistic, cultural, economic
>- cartoon life or life-as-cartoon--the implications of the growing
popularity of adult cartoons or the cartoon-like behaviour of action heros
in popular dramas and pop stars in music videos
>- any of the above considered as a deterritorialization of death
>- homelessness--as nomadology, as a class issue, as post-nationalism, as
object of legal or political regulation (Deleuze to squeegee kids?)
>- the local--how might it be re-thought in the context of globalization?
>
>New writing and visual art, reproducible in black and white, are welcome.
Please submit a brief note of intention and description of your proposed
submission (150 words) by 30 July 1999.  Final submissions are due 30
November 1999.

Author of numerous books of poetry, prose, drama, and criticism, Leslie
Scalapino's recent publications include Green and Black: Selected Writings
(Talisman House, 1996) and a collaboration with Lyn Hejinian, Sight (Edge,
1999). She edits and publishes O Books. Her new book is New Time (Wesleyan
University Press), an impressionistic diary that outlines and condenses her
discovery of a new kind of time in Japan, Berkeley and Oakland. "This
crystalline epic may be Scalapino's most 'accessible' book yet," writes Ron
Silliman, "but its surfaces perpetually peel back to reveal a further that
could never have existed before." Scalapino is, of course, one of America's
greatest poets and a San Francisco landmark mighty and startling as the
great Bay Bridge.

Lewis Warsh's involvement in the San Francisco poetry scene dates from the
time he was a teenager, when he sat at Jack Spicer's feet at Aquatic Park
and jousted with him at Gino & Carlo's bar in North Beach. In New York he
became an important figure in the so-called "Second Generation" of New York
School poets, editing The World with Anne Waldman and United Artists Books
with Bernadette Mayer. Lewis Warsh is the author of two novels, A Free Man
and Agnes & Sally, a book of stories, Money Under the Table, and numerous
books of poems, including Information from the Surface of Venus and Avenue
of Escape. It has been too long since we in San Francisco have heard him
speak out to us, for his is a writing that is uniquely inventful, romantic
and satiric, striking every musical note, every percussive event known to
God, Satan and the free radical animals of the earth.

In our new flim, ALAN SONDHEIM is a waffle called "my". The waffle says,
"Her beautiful legs were visible on the sofa thoro's a noodle in my
skull..." On the waffle, LAWRENCE UPTON is the butter, and we begin to see
the tableau as a "still life". The butter slips out words like "delphinium"
and "spoil" and "shrub". RON HENRY gushes syrup, and discusses what's
happening "today on cable": "A 1984 film about breakdancing..." Orange
juice arrives in the form of CHRIS PIUMA, who reports on "dick welluwould",
"who has plastered pearls on temptress Liz Taytor and fuzzynaveled prop
swinger Jack Michelson". And a small glass of milk named DONNA LeVINE
completes our balanced breakfast with her "target yo-yo". "(It pissed off
the members of the band Kiss.)"

PIGLET AND POOH

These two now serve as model and allegory.
They bear the brunt of producing a spectacle.
The discharge between language and action.
An exceptional act within the master narrative
mimed on their bodies.  They pass over into the act,
making the transition to action, moving to an inscription
producing real change.  Transformation in the Real
of the relations of production.  Make it the object of a transmission.
Annul the force trapped in the past, everything other than present.
Go back to the act that split things up and and and CUT CUT CUT

Two who were alike just one more night, electrical failure.
Miners on strike.  The greatest norms have also all the old afflictions.

Affiliations:  fictive interdependence carrying out in the Imaginary
roles of extras, figures becoming possible at the present time
--anticipate the culture to come--not now, not utopia, anachronism
has a specific power.  The cultural function of the anomaly
not situated in the symbolic order in view of the impossible
configurations of a return to childhood.  Embody this group
of anomalies showing the fissures, the fault lines the two of them
are a mirroring, a double-toy.  In the identification lived out,
the gamut of posturing and display, exhibition, meta-imago and
orchestra.
The stadium.  The rows of onlookers with their distracted eyes.
Expressive stagings repeat the scenes they have in common.

The body as intermediary, prop, passage.
The one viewing the other cries out in pain.
Setting in motion the "M" manuscript, formulate the fantasy
the real face.  Falsified?  False?

The passage from public to private.
Myth floating around and space is made and remade.
Children play in public games not made to be seen.
The fusion of child's play with no one knows.

Silence is a serious sign. A massacre,
or feast day without an anniversary.
A path you exit by to come to somewhere you've never been.
Repetitive words.  Idea come to mind.

Staves they call them.
Spirit and cellular memories.
Here are objects with hidden powers.
Here are the guides that will come.

In the way of an event note I'd like to try to contribute a remark or
two around the exchange developing around the essay in Rhizome, starting
not from this or that kind of poetry, but by gesturing towards another
kind of space and neighborhood and environment where art might be
written and painted and and and.

Saturday evening May 15 here in Cleveland 25 mostly residents of a
renovated elementary school building built at the turn of the century a
few blocks away from where Hart Crane went to high school showed their
art and sculpture, read poetry, danced to African drumming, listened to
electronic music and mingled with a turn-out of some 100-125 people in
and out across 4-5 hours.  We went through 50 bottles of wine and a
couple of tables of party food, putting on an event that cost each of
the 25 participants 25 dollars plus 250 dollars put up by our landlord.

Maybe the neighborhood was part of the draw, I don't know.  Everyone was
surprised by the response.  A year ago in the same neighborhood ATF and
FBI agents carried out an operation they called Operation Gansta Wrap, a
drug bust reported on by a local news station a block away at my bus
stop which called the area "the heart of the Cleveland drug trade."  As
I watched on the evening news, I could see the newsman was visibly
nervous, and didn't seem to know where he was.  A visitor from another
world.

My sense of the neighborhood that I've called home for three years
oscillates between two extreme but very real images:  four teenage girls
dancing in the street at 2:00 a.m. and chanting "c'mon and gitcha red
hots" under the floodlight of a cop chopper hovering above them, and a
cracked-out or drunk or probably both woman staggering down the street
past my bus stop one afternoon pounding her naked breasts and screaming
obscenities to the air.  The faces on the people around the bus stop and
the cornerstore looking on were blank, expressionless, but far from
thoughtless.

But neither is it every kid with a gun, as Cauleen Smith so eloquently
said about West Oakland when she was in Cleveland promoting her first
film, and thinking about the Hodge School and what it accomplished with
its recent event along with thinking about what it might represent in
potentia, prompts a few notes that may or may not be related to some of
the concerns apparently raised in Rhizome.

One, the only thing we had in common was the fact that, apart from
several folks in art support group, we live in the same building, and
the show was an introduction for many of us to each others' work.  There
was no problem with who was to be invited or not, though some residents
decided to keep to themselves.  A kind of built-in differentness was the
result, even eclecticness.  There was school-trained art alongside folk
art, spoken word alongside the literary, African drums alongside
electronics.  Nobody here has whatever a national reputation is supposed
to represent, and there were as many "beginners," people who have been
painting and writing for only a year or so, alongside people who have
been doing whatever they've been doing for years.

Two, the audience was so different it's impossible to characterize.
People who follow the gallery scene, a few writers, some musicians,
graphic artists, and a lot (a lot) of young people.  I doubt if this
audience is any different than any other large group of people in any
medium to large-sized city in the U.S.  As far as writing expectations
go, obviously the spoken word/performance thing is something of an
expectation, but the three poems I read were anything but that, and I
didn't look up from my page once.  The most negative reaction I got was
from a musician I'd met a few times before, who said "I've got to tell
you, you're stuff is impossibly abstruse," and then later in the evening
came back at me with the term, "logokinesis" to describe what he thought
about my poems.  Since I haven't read in public for three years, this
take by a so-called "unliterary" ear was important to hear.  An
unexpected, meaningful response coming from nowhere.

Three, or somewhere.  What is local?  Is it simply regional?  In my
worst moments the institutions which promote a national culture appear
like aircraft carriers for Washington with the long range guns from
either Neidecker or the Foggy Dew, depending on who you listen to,
patrolling the waters and assimilating every raw impulse from below into
a market value.  The potential for a radical politics and artmaking
coinciding getting sacrificed as a result, remembering that what
happened in Russian a century ago was originally intensely fractured and
decentralized, All Power to the Soviets, etc., and Spicer's 'What is
happening in a 70 mile radius' comes to mind as a related critique of
the institutions of a so-called national culture.  Again, this is a
worst moment thought tempered by my lack of experience, having only read
my work in public five times in San Francisco 1991-95 and once in New
Jersey at the New Freedoms conference in 1994.   Representing the work
I've gotten done here, 1000 pages or so of a manuscript called Works and
Days, xeroxed on to cardstock across five large spiral notebooks and set
out on a table under a laminated poster of Jack Spicer from the 86 SF
conference, were a continued object of attention from curious viewers.
I put them out there as a kind of example of writtenness to counter
spoken word performance assumptions.

Four, what could be done in dirtcheap loftspaces like this in other
cities, painters and dancers and musicians and writers and others living
in close proximity, the face-to-face real life thing supplementing the
radicality of web subjectivity, and especially if doing what isn't being
done here, like forming a cooperative, holding workshops, regular shows,
running a press--I'm sure there's precedents in places like New York and
San Francisco and elsewhere in the 60s that might resemble this
possibility, especially if such areas or zones were organized in inner
city areas that more and more are beginning to resemble the closed
district for the super-exploitation of labor which according to
administrative documents quoted in the film, Fotomator, were among the
first plans for the Warsaw ghetto.

Because it isn't every kid with a gun.  Though it's a sign of the times
and a good one I think that C-Town Productions is showing May 22-23 at 8
p.m. at the Cleveland Playhouse a performance called E. 79th STREET,
written and directed by F.A. Taylor, choreography by Sabrina C. Gregory,
"The Hough Riots Brought Back To Life Through Poetry, Dance and Drama."
The Hodge School is located between E. 74th and 76th Streets.

Here's a sample of seven of the 25 contributors' notes from the event
program to pass on as a kind of sign for (local?) (regional?) art and
performance.

ISHMAEL ANKHENATON.  Began classical ballet at age 9, studied at Ravel
Studio of Ballet and Jazz; the ODU Ballet of Virginia; the Conservatory
of Classical Dance; Dance Theater of Harlem; Alvin Alley American Dance
Center and Djoniba Dance Company.  He is a former member of the Imani
African-American Dance Company and has studied dance with Chuck Davis,
Joan Peters, Alan Onickel, Maxine and Marle Basse.

LISA CHENG.  Draws with mixed media.  She graduated from The Cooper
Union in NYC with a BFA in Studio Art and holds an MA in Art History
from Oberlin College.  She has taught children art at the Cleveland
Museum of Art and the Cleveland Institute of Art.

ROMMELL FRANKLIN.  Rommell Franklin A.K.A. Brother Kenyatta is a drum
maker, African drumming teacher, and percussionist of West African
drumming.  He teaches, performs and makes drums of Guinea, Mali, Liberia
and other African countries.  He has performed with African drum and
dance groups such as Iroko Drum and Dance Society, Dance Africa Dance,
Imani African-American Dance Co., and Djembefolalu.

GREGORY HOLMES.  This work was done solely in response to the myriad of
emotions and situations that accompanies a diagnosis of AIDS in 1988.
More than a decade later, this impact and the life altering changes it
brought continue; it remains an issue without resolution.

DESHAWN (CASIO) JONES is a talented local Hip-Hop artist who at age
eleven began using the beat box to compose his own works.  He listened
extensively to the Fat Boys, Run-D.M.C., KSR One, Kool-Moe Dee and L.L.
Cool Jay.  He has developed his own style and never uses anyone else's.
He is very thankful to God for his talent and gift to help the young
seeds (children) of today by giving them some positive energy to soak
into their brains.

MICHAELANGELO LOVELACE.  Cleveland born artist who explores concerns
about cultural, racial, and economic tensions in the inner-city.  The
paintings take a realistic look at what it's really like growing up in a
community that is sometimes looked upon as a war-zone.  A community
where anything can happen at any time.  The paintings deal with the
crime, drugs, street corner drunks, sex-hustlers and many other day to
day happenings in the hood.  The technique of his work is acrylic on
textured canvas.  Vibrant, childlike imagery is reminiscent of the work
of both folk art and outsider art.

ALEXIS THYNNE.  Interest in different cultures has taken her across the
U.S. and also to the Central African Republic and Cameroon, where she
spent two years teaching secondary level biology and one year teaching
elementary level environmental education.  Her love of art was
rediscovered when she began using murals as a teaching aid for
environmental education.  Ever since, Alexis has been exploring her own
experiences through mixed media.

In closing, some notes jotted down during an impromptu talk by Brother
Kenyatta's group:

"you have to make the drum speak
if you really listen you can hear the voices
this helps amplify the sound

sometimes in Africa
when the sun hits the metal piece
you can't get that in Cleveland

you got them three main sounds
bass tom-tom and the snare
you know what polyrhythm is right?

how to fit in how to move off
they make a big ceremony
everybody get together

the drum took me to a different level
I can make this Bar-B-Q can into a drum
your head will be in a zone your whole life

trying to put the respect back into these instruments
just like it was a violin
what's the long thing--a "cello"

the drum is a spiritual instrument
different energy levels that may come into the circle
my teacher was from Liberia
"this is a goat skin"

that's what they're doing
they're like talking you see

in West Africa right next to the Ivory Coast
they play this rhythm to their crops
they walking 124 miles or something

I play Brazilian.  I play Cuban.
there's so many percussions you can learn

everyone from the village in Guinea
they play this rhythm
all you got to do is say AYEAYH

your soul is telling you to go join
go gather for the harvest

we go crops.  we go drum."

Dear Standard,

I think you are doing yourself and your ideas a tremendous disservice by
focussing on this issue of careerism which your statements have not
demonstrated to be a very well-considered, historically-conscious position.
It seems to me quite obvious, for example, that very few of the Language
poets had any idea that their ideas would obtain for them the degree of
academic acceptance that they have, in the past decade, received, and if
you would like to argue this point, I would ask you to return to the
numerous staple-bound, yellowing and otherwise low-tech and low-print-run
publications that were circulating in the 70s and 80s when they were first
looking at each other's poetry and seeing a common set of interests
developing, and cite those instances where you think 1) any of the those
poets thought they were writing in a style that would eventually become
something like the norm in academic studies, or maybe how their writing
styles and ideas actually gelled with what was happening in academic
studies at the time, 2) where you think that this "careerism" seriously or
even moderately compromised the general goal, aura or collective effort at
investigation (as opposed to exploitation) that is, I think, one of the
nobler aims of a group effort in poetics, the uncovering of lost ideas or
perhaps the refocussing or "make it new" of dilapidated ones, 3) how many
of the poets who were writing at this time who are not of the "language
school" were actually resisting assimilation into what, to you apparently,
was a very obvious upward track into the academe, which is to say, would a
poet working in primarily "speech based" poetics at the time (some of whom
were professors) be considered resistant to an obvious "spectre haunting
America poetry" or were they working in a tradition which, to some, had
itself run its course and was not likely to produce anything more
interesting without a degree of revamping.

In terms of this last point, I would relate that in talking to several New
York poets who were around at the time and who were not part of the
"language" thing -- indeed, being excluded from the publication of that
name and being quite miffed by this fact -- still are far more generous to
what happened with the magazine and the "movement" than many of the poets
of my age or slightly younger, understanding that at a basic level what
those people were up to was something quite different.  Which is to say,
these poets who were there at the time were well aware of these several
factors that I allude to above, that it was really a "grassroots" kind of
thing that didn't have a Marjorie Perloff or Hank Lazar (the mile-long
shelf of critics raising the LangPos to the lofty height of canonicity) to
give it the sort of guarantee that you seem to be believe -- again, I
challenge you to find where this assurance is -- was there to push on their
efforts.  There was very little money circulating in that community for
publications of any nature, that the lifestyles of these poets were often
at least as radically "outside" as the more standard boho lifestyle of a
Lower East Side poet (and they mostly lived in the Lower East Side,
anyway), blah blah blah.  Before "language," all of these poets more or
less did the same thing, went to see music, art, read at St. Mark's and
went to the readings, commented, complained, wondered if Olson was what he
was cracked up to be, etc.  (I would note that despite what people think of
the New York poetry scene, the crowds mix here quite a bit and continue to
do so, the real lines being present only in the minds of those who seem to
need them to get by.)

I would suggest, if we want to talk about the "co-opting of the arts by
institutions," that your own method of publishing your magazine plays more
into the basic method of a fast-track to institutionalization than the
publishing method of the Language poets, which, again, was very cheap,
community-based, spontaneous, hard to find "closure" in, etc.  A new issue
of Rhizome -- and I am not criticizing you for publishing it, I'm just
asking you to put it's parameters under the "socratic light" in a way that
I would ask you to put the LangPos publications under the same light, and
tell me which is more "radical" -- arrives on my doorstep from an anonymous
publisher to whom I had sent a check in much the same way that Art in
America would (were I to subsribe to it) or October, etc.

Here are some quotes from your post and responses:

"What I was trying to contend in my essay is that "radical artfice" and
"indeterminacy" often coincide with a poetic practice that looks an awful
lot like a struggle between academics and their discursive efforts to
control the determination of good poetry."

-- You fail to establish this point in your essay, but as I don't have this
with me I can't argue with that text.  But I would like to ask where you
find Charles Bernstein, for instance, talking about "good poetry," in those
very terms since you obviously are very happy with taking other terms of
his out of context.  I would also like to argue that Charles would not make
the mistake that you are making in your comments here, as he goes to great
lengths to establish any sort of new terminology with a wealth of often
very rich material, whether it be Veronca Forrest-Thomson (whom I would
suggest you read before deciding that "radical artifice" and "emotion" are
as incompatible as you state) to Langston Hughes.  This is an effort to
show exactly what he is talking about "looks like."  You might want to
illustrate, also, which "struggle" you are talking about, perhaps a lengthy
quote from one such struggle, and compare this to, say, one of these poems
you are talking about.  As a final point, I would add that a comparison
with Pound's "discursive efforts to control the determination of good
poetry" probably resembled the mainstream and academic effort of his time
to make these very same value judgements, though in form rather than in
content or even style of rhetoric, than Charles' do his own mainstream
contemporaries.

"In concrete terms, this means that we who believe that radical politics is
at least possible cannot mistake the act of simply writing vague,
fragmented, ambiguous etc poems with the changing of the business of
poetry."

-- Yes, you cannot, but there are many other mistakes that can be made,
such as that of an emotionalism unmodified by recourse to the data at hand.

"The business of poetry is all the various devices, contraptions which do
the actually judging of poetry and that lead to a belief that the only
important writers are those who are being written on (cf. the writers of
dissertations)."

-- One thing I would mention, again looking at this Pound / Bernstein
dichotomy, is that Bernstein has struggled to come up with a critical
apparatus with which to guage the "quality" of poetry which is
decentralized, open to anomaly, not focused on the racial or gender make-up
of the group with which he is most associated, non-canonical in the sense
that many of the poets he writes about were not "universal" writers in the
sense of Goethe or, closer to home, Frost, etc.  While there are many ways
to argue with his essays -- and I have several friends whom you would
consider "stooges" (I think you use this word twice in your essay) of the
Language Poets who have taken essays such as "Poetics of the Americas" to
task -- the essential contours of the project are very admirable and
deserve very close attention, and the method, which relies on incredible
amounts of research, thought as to the context in which the statements will
appear, etc. not to mention focusing _on_ that context, which indeed is
often an academic context -- who has been a more strong and legitimate
critic of the practices of the academy (which, despite our coolness in
pride in being "non-academic" and "street-wise" is a major cultural
institution which, unless you want to throw it out completely, is worth
attempting to review and rebuild) than Charles Bernstein?  I'm sure there
are dozens of people who are willing to claim that it's "ruining poetry,"
blah blah, and that Charles is just another cog, but there has been a
subtle shift in the attentions of his essays that has been toward a
consideration of that very institution to which he belongs -- a very
pointed, angry, to many annoying, specific, meaningful, researched,
criticism which, if anything, illustrates the integrity of his project.
That is, he is not in denial that he is part of an institution of which he
is highly critical, and in fact may find abhorrent (though I shouldn't
advertise this point, he would be the first one to dissuade you from
attending the Buffalo program if he didn't think it was worth your time).
Well, I won't go on here, unless this really bugs you.

"What I commend Jeff Clark for in my essay applies to Garrett Caples,
Martin Corless Smith, Cathy Wagner, Tracy
Grinnel, Emily Grossman, Brian Lucas and other "non-allied" poets."

-- They won't be much longer, if you or anyone else decides to group them
that way.  The "Non-allied Poets" will be the subject of Marjorie Perloff
2010's famous book, the "Poetics of the (oops) Decentralized."

"I commend these poets' refusal to use theory as a way of justifying their
own work as either socially relevant or "radical" or even  "progressive" or
even necessary.  I also commend them for not falling into the (fake)
hermeticism
of the mainstream. A refusal to play poetry for tenure, promotion, etc may
be the most politically effective gesture yet because as along as poetry
resembles business, some way to join the firm or succeed in school, we
cannot have
"radical" poetries."

-- But the turn has to be made to suggest how these poetries are "radical"
apart from their apparent break with the fake, in your terms, radicalism of
the previous generation.  In other words, let's find positive terms rather
than negative ones, and the "challenge round" could be: let's find positive
terms for these poets' poetics without being Ezra Pound, i.e. finding a
tradition for them to be in the line of defending.  I don't find anything
radical about the poetries of these writers, but I am more than willing to
be convinced that they are "radical" -- but then again, they certainly
don't have to be, either, for me to like them, as I read all kinds of stuff
that's politically luke-warm and like it bundles.  Consequently, it's very
depressing to me to think that this is the most "politically effective
gesture yet" since, well, that's a pretty narrow sense of politics.  I
wouldn't be able to explain _that_ to my mother.

"I commend their humility and I believe that it will go along way farther
to counteracting the self-aggrandizing, self-promotional carreerist
tendencies that have arrisen out of an american poetic-theoretical nexus
associated with "collapsed subjectivity".  The decentered poem does
nothing, but when it is consecrated by a host of Hank Lazers,
Marjorie Perloffs, and so forth a very real subjectivitiy is made:  the
celebrity poet."

-- I'm sure they are very nice people, and there are, without a doubt, a
few "self-aggrandizing" poets of the Language ilk whose purported interests
in collectivity and objective, informed consideration of cultural politics,
etc., runs counter to the obviously (not necessarily masculinist but
certainly mostly) pride in being as learned as they are, and being able to
muscle through the most abstract conversation about issues that, in the
end, are pretty dead as soon as they hit air.  I could tell you a few
stories.  But there just aren't nearly as many as statements like the above
would suggest, and, again, I am not sure why we choose to criticize poets
who have done the kind of reading that their ideas deserve in order to make
them fuller, more informed, etc.  As Pound himself would write, do we
commend a musician for bragging that he/she does not know how to play
Mozart?  (Yes, Paul McCartney never took singing lessons, hurrah.)  It's
also a terrible reduction, again, to think that "collapsed subjectivity"
has been the primary modus-operandi of the recent American poetics,
especially since you suggest, above, that "radical artifice" is the main
axis point -- you like to work in scare quotes, with interchangeable
targets.  I think many of us are not nearly as oppressed by the catch
phrases.

"One of the most important points Perloff makes in POETICS OF
INDETERIMINACY is, if I recall, in the chapter on Stein where she discusses
the difference between indeterminacy and ambiguity.  There her formalism is
at its finest: she shows in detail what made Stein great and what her
imitators were not too clear about."

-- Please elaborate on this binary.  Despite what you might think, I agree
with you that cartloads of writing has been produced out of a very vague,
un-aesthetic (I mean non-self critical in terms of whether the art at hand
is really "working") sense of praxis, and that, in bulk, it is likely to
turn off anyone to what we call "postmodern" or even contemporary poetry.
On the other hand, when I approach this work and my teeth start to gnash, I
have that little line of Bob Dylan's floating around in the back of my head
-- and if I could sing it the way he does right here I would -- "Don't
crticize what you don't understand."  And so I try to understand, and gnash
later.  This language of "imitators" is very Poundian, but so again I ask
you to look at these ideas -- innovation, imitation, originality, etc. --
divorced from your obvious aesthetic biases and see if they really work, or
are even necessary.  "Imitation" has a certain "radical" (a word I rarely)
potential which, well, I am investigating.

"It is in an interesting time to consider whether or not a writer should
possess a strong ego and whether or not the language school's post-humanism
was every anything but the proliferation of the ego by new means, in new
modes."

-- This is any easy one to answer: yes.  Of course, but from there, let's
see what these particular egos have managed to produce, what are the
contours of the work, how to they operate socially, when and where has the
ego been sacrificed for something that could be called (for lack of a
better word) "constructivist," how is the ego played off of this
construction, is it really as closed and negating an ego as we at first
feel, is it charmless and sterile, etc.

I think that your essay, and this particular post, are part of a trend that
I sense very strongly write now in poets who are, say, generally within my
age range, some older some younger (so that would be mid-twenties to
mid-thirties) who are prone to making very over-arching, "emotional" (most
more often hysterical) statements about how the Languae Poets have
completely subtracted a certain variable -- "emotion" -- from the poetic
equation in America.  I would suggest two quick things to read, Max Weber's
Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism for an idea of where "our"
sense of emotion has gone -- it's gone quite far, but far away, I think,
such that now we don't really know how rich "emotion" can be, or how
complicated -- but also Charles' exchange with Louis Simpson in one of
those books that Lazar published a while back, an exchange that reappears,
I think, in the Politics of Poetic Form, in which his ideas on "emotion"
are most misunderstood and most strongly stated.  I certainly don't think
it's wrong to take CB up on his ideas -- that's what they're there for, in
fact, and few welcome strong criticism of his ideas like he does -- but the
"ambiguous, not too clear" criticism the likes of which appear in your
essay are none to productive.

Well, I could go on, but, luckily perhaps, am out of time.

Sincerely,
Brian

Pierre Joris & Nicole Peyrafitte's MANIFESTO&A performance
combines poetry, voice, electronically displayed visuals,  and
violin improvisations by jil hanifan.

Originally based on Pierre Joris’ NOMAD MANIFESTO which
states:
“-A nomadic poetics is a war machine, always on the move,
always changing, morphing, moving through languages,
cultures, terrains, times without stopping. Refueling halts are
called poases, they last a night or a day, the time of a poem, &
then move on.
- A nomadic poetics needs mindfulness. In & of the drift (dérive)
there is no at- home-ness here but only an ever more displaced
drifting. …”

The MANIFESTO will be the main thread from which Joris &
Peyrafitte will present their latest texts, drawings, paintings
and songs as jil hanifan's violin stitches them together or apart.

Dear Standard,

I think you are doing yourself and your ideas a tremendous disservice by
focusing on this issue of careerism which your statements have not
demonstrated to be a very well-considered, historically-conscious position.
It seems to me quite obvious, for example, that very few of the Language
poets had any idea that their ideas would obtain for them the degree of
academic acceptance that they have, in the past decade, received, and if
you would like to argue this point, I would ask you to return to the
numerous staple-bound, yellowing and otherwise low-tech and low-print-run
publications that were circulating in the 70s and 80s when they were first
looking at each other's poetry and seeing a common set of interests
developing, and cite those instances where you think 1) any of the those
poets thought they were writing in a style that would eventually become
something like the norm in academic studies, or maybe how their writing
styles and ideas actually gelled with what was happening in academic
studies at the time, 2) where you think that this "careerism" seriously or
even moderately compromised the general goal, aura or collective effort at
investigation (as opposed to exploitation) that is, I think, one of the
nobler aims of a group effort in poetics, the uncovering of lost ideas or
perhaps the refocusing or "make it new" of dilapidated ones, 3) how many of
the poets who were writing at this time who are not of the "language
school" were actually resisting assimilation into what, to you apparently,
was a very obvious upward track into the academe, which is to say, would a
poet working in primarily "speech based" poetics at the time (some of whom
were professors) be considered resistant to an obvious "spectre haunting
America poetry" or were they working in a tradition which, to some, had
itself run its course and was not likely to produce anything more
interesting without a degree of revamping.

In terms of this last point, I would relate that in talking to several New
York poets who were around at the time and who were not part of the
"language" thing -- indeed, being excluded from the publication of that
name and being quite miffed by this fact -- still are far more generous to
what happened with the magazine and the "movement" than many of the poets
of my age or slightly younger, understanding that at a basic level what
those people were up to was something quite different.  Which is to say,
these poets who were there at the time were well aware of these several
factors that I allude to above, that it was really a "grassroots" kind of
thing that didn't have a Marjorie Perloff or Hank Lazar (the mile-long
shelf of critics raising the LangPos to the lofty height of canonicity) to
give it the sort of guarantee that you seem to be believe -- again, I
challenge you to find where this assurance is -- was there to push on their
efforts.  There was very little money circulating in that community for
publications of any nature, that the lifestyles of these poets were often
at least as radically "outside" as the more standard boho lifestyle of a
Lower East Side poet (and they mostly lived in the Lower East Side,
anyway), blah blah blah.  Before "language," all of these poets more or
less did the same thing, went to see music, art, read at St. Mark's and
went to the readings, commented, complained, wondered if Olson was what he
was cracked up to be, etc.  (I would note that despite what people think of
the New York poetry scene, the crowds mix here quite a bit and continue to
do so, the real lines being present only in the minds of those who seem to
need them to get by.)

I would suggest, if we want to talk about the "co-opting of the arts by
institutions," that your own method of publishing your magazine plays more
into the basic method of a fast-track to institutionalization than the
publishing method of the Language poets, which, again, was very cheap,
community-based, spontaneous, hard to find "closure" in, etc.  A new issue
of Rhizome -- and I am not criticizing you for publishing it, I'm just
asking you to put it's parameters under the "socratic light" in a way that
I would ask you to put the LangPos publications under the same light, and
tell me which is more "radical" -- arrives on my doorstep from an anonymous
publisher to whom I had sent a check in much the same way that Art in
America would (were I to subscribe to it) or October, etc.

Here are some quotes from your post and responses:

"What I was trying to contend in my essay is that "radical artifice" and
"indeterminacy" often coincide with a poetic practice that looks an awful
lot like a struggle between academics and their discursive efforts to
control the determination of good poetry."

-- You fail to establish this point in your essay, but as I don't have this
with me I can't argue with that text.  But I would like to ask where you
find Charles Bernstein, for instance, talking about "good poetry," in those
very terms since you obviously are very happy with taking other terms of
his out of context.  I would also like to argue that Charles would not make
the mistake that you are making in your comments here, as he goes to great
lengths to establish any sort of new terminology with a wealth of often
very rich material, whether it be Veronica Forrest-Thomson (whom I would
suggest you read before deciding that "radical artifice" and "emotion" are
as incompatible as you state) to Langston Hughes.  This is an effort to
show exactly what he is talking about "looks like."  You might want to
illustrate, also, which "struggle" you are talking about, perhaps a lengthy
quote from one such struggle, and compare this to, say, one of these poems
you are talking about.  As a final point, I would add that a comparison
with Pound's "discursive efforts to control the determination of good
poetry" probably resembled the mainstream and academic effort of his time
to make these very same value judgments, though in form rather than in
content or even style of rhetoric, than Charles' do his own mainstream
contemporaries.

"In concrete terms, this means that we who believe that radical politics is
at least possible cannot mistake the act of simply writing vague,
fragmented, ambiguous etc. poems with the changing of the business of
poetry."

-- Yes, you cannot, but there are many other mistakes that can be made,
such as that of an emotionalism unmodified by recourse to the data at hand.

"The business of poetry is all the various devices, contraptions which do
the actually judging of poetry and that lead to a belief that the only
important writers are those who are being written on (cf. the writers of
dissertations)."

-- One thing I would mention, again looking at this Pound / Bernstein
dichotomy, is that Bernstein has struggled to come up with a critical
apparatus with which to gauge the "quality" of poetry which is
decentralized, open to anomaly, not focused on the racial or gender make-up
of the group with which he is most associated, non-canonical in the sense
that many of the poets he writes about were not "universal" writers in the
sense of Goethe or, closer to home, Frost, etc.  While there are many ways
to argue with his essays -- and I have several friends whom you would
consider "stooges" (I think you use this word twice in your essay) of the
Language Poets who have taken essays such as "Poetics of the Americas" to
task -- the essential contours of the project are very admirable and
deserve very close attention, and the method, which relies on incredible
amounts of research, thought as to the context in which the statements will
appear, etc. not to mention focusing _on_ that context, which indeed is
often an academic context -- who has been a more strong and legitimate
critic of the practices of the academy (which, despite our coolness in
pride in being "non-academic" and "street-wise" is a major cultural
institution which, unless you want to throw it out completely, is worth
attempting to review and rebuild) than Charles Bernstein?  I'm sure there
are dozens of people who are willing to claim that it's "ruining poetry,"
blah blah, and that Charles is just another cog, but there has been a
subtle shift in the attentions of his essays that has been toward a
consideration of that very institution to which he belongs -- a very
pointed, angry, to many annoying, specific, meaningful, researched,
criticism which, if anything, illustrates the integrity of his project.
That is, he is not in denial that he is part of an institution of which he
is highly critical, and in fact may find abhorrent (though I shouldn't
advertise this point, he would be the first one to dissuade you from
attending the Buffalo program if he didn't think it was worth your time).
Well, I won't go on here, unless this really bugs you.

"What I commend Jeff Clark for in my essay applies to Garrett Caples,
Martin Corless Smith, Cathy Wagner, Tracy
Grinnel, Emily Grossman, Brian Lucas and other "non-allied" poets."

-- They won't be much longer, if you or anyone else decides to group them
that way.  The "Non-allied Poets" will be the subject of Marjorie Perloff
2010's famous book, the "Poetics of the Oops Decentralized."

"I commend these poets' refusal to use theory as a way of justifying their
own work as either socially relevant or "radical" or even  "progressive" or
even necessary.  I also commend them for not falling into the (fake)
hermeticism
of the mainstream. A refusal to play poetry for tenure, promotion, etc. may
be the most politically effective gesture yet because as along as poetry
resembles business, some way to join the firm or succeed in school, we
cannot have
"radical" poetries."

-- But the turn has to be made to suggest how these poetries are "radical"
apart from their apparent break with the fake, in your terms, radicalism of
the previous generation.  In other words, let's find positive terms rather
than negative ones, and the "challenge round" could be: let's find positive
terms for these poets' poetics without being Ezra Pound, i.e. finding a
tradition for them to be in the line of defending.  I don't find anything
radical about the poetries of these writers, but I am more than willing to
be convinced that they are "radical" -- but then again, they certainly
don't have to be, either, for me to like them, as I read all kinds of stuff
that's politically luke-warm and like it bundles.  Consequently, it's very
depressing to me to think that this is the most "politically effective
gesture yet" since, well, that's a pretty narrow sense of politics.  I
wouldn't be able to explain _that_ to my mother.

"I commend their humility and I believe that it will go along way farther
to counteracting the self-aggrandizing, self-promotional careerist
tendencies that have arisen out of an american poetic-theoretical nexus
associated with "collapsed subjectivity".  The decentered poem does
nothing, but when it is consecrated by a host of Hank Lazers,
Marjorie Perloffs, and so forth a very real subjectivitiy is made:  the
celebrity poet."

-- I'm sure they are very nice people, and there are, without a doubt, a
few "self-aggrandizing" poets of the Language ilk whose purported interests
in collectivity and objective, informed consideration of cultural politics,
etc., runs counter to the obviously (not necessarily masculinist but
certainly mostly) pride in being as learned as they are, and being able to
muscle through the most abstract conversation about issues that, in the
end, are pretty dead as soon as they hit air.  I could tell you a few
stories.  But there just aren't nearly as many as statements like the above
would suggest, and, again, I am not sure why we choose to criticize poets
who have done the kind of reading that their ideas deserve in order to make
them fuller, more informed, etc.  As Pound himself would write, do we
commend a musician for bragging that he/she does not know how to play
Mozart?  (Yes, Paul McCartney never took singing lessons, hurrah.)  It's
also a terrible reduction, again, to think that "collapsed subjectivity"
has been the primary modus-operandi of the recent American poetics,
especially since you suggest, above, that "radical artifice" is the main
axis point -- you like to work in scare quotes, with interchangeable
targets.  I think many of us are not nearly as oppressed by the catch
phrases.

"One of the most important points Perloff makes in POETICS OF
INDETERIMINACY is, if I recall, in the chapter on Stein where she discusses
the difference between indeterminacy and ambiguity.  There her formalism is
at its finest: she shows in detail what made Stein great and what her
imitators were not too clear about."

-- Please elaborate on this binary.  Despite what you might think, I agree
with you that cartloads of writing has been produced out of a very vague,
un-aesthetic (I mean non-self critical in terms of whether the art at hand
is really "working") sense of praxis, and that, in bulk, it is likely to
turn off anyone to what we call "postmodern" or even contemporary poetry.
On the other hand, when I approach this work and my teeth start to gnash, I
have that little line of Bob Dylan's floating around in the back of my head
-- and if I could sing it the way he does right here I would -- "Don't
criticize what you don't understand."  And so I try to understand, and
gnash later.  This language of "imitators" is very Poundian, but so again I
ask you to look at these ideas -- innovation, imitation, originality, etc.
-- divorced from your obvious aesthetic biases and see if they really work,
or are even necessary.  "Imitation" has a certain "radical" (a word I
rarely use, actually) potential which, well, I am investigating.

"It is in an interesting time to consider whether or not a writer should
possess a strong ego and whether or not the language school's post-humanism
was every anything but the proliferation of the ego by new means, in new
modes."

-- This is any easy one to answer: yes.  Of course, but from there, let's
see what these particular egos have managed to produce, what are the
contours of the work, how to they operate socially, when and where has the
ego been sacrificed for something that could be called (for lack of a
better word) "constructivist," how is the ego played off of this
construction, is it really as closed and negating an ego as we at first
feel, is it charmless and sterile, etc.

I think that your essay, and this particular post, are part of a trend that
I sense very strongly write now in poets who are, say, generally within my
age range, some older some younger (so that would be mid-twenties to
mid-thirties) who are prone to making very over-arching, "emotional" (most

Well, I could go on, but, luckily perhaps, am out of time.

where all revolves around the central eye) and what I call the "sentimental"
lyric (multivoiced, multiviewpointed, objectifying the speaker as much as

"who wd want to get saddled with that term?"


and Rachel Blau DuPlessis wrote; "What I am trying to say is 1) we all have
a relation to lyric even if we reject part of it or all of it (I made this
point at Barnard; rejection is a relationship)  2) lyric is multiple and

will let us reject any knee-jerk responses (pro or con) to that word. 3)
when people use lyric modes what part of lyric are they using. I consider
that I use the lyric, but want to surround it with other discourses and
subjectivities so that it loses its "master-narrative" quality and becomes
one element among many others 4) what is the social-psychological surround
of lyric? Do we want to agree (with Allen Grossman, for example) that it
encodes an oedipal plot (see gender-laden critique of this by RBD in
"Manifests" in Diacritics). The one thing that Barnard did, especially that
keynote panel, was to remind us to reject binaries."

some thoughts to the numbers...

1) i'd agree with this but i wonder how much we can make of a 'relation of
rejection' / aren't there folks out there who've never been drawn to lyric
but who also haven't made a rejection of same central to what they do as
poets ?

2) yes

3) has anyone.. critic poet etc.. made a grand taxonomy of lyric impulses ?
- i'm not expecting any to've nailed the whole thing down of course i just
wondered if there were such things out there and if anyone had found them
useful in considering what they might and might not want to do with
something called a 'lyric tradition'

4) the socio-psychological surround - i imagine that some wd find this of
intense interest - but i wdn't want to be stuck with the Allen Grossman
reading that is mentioned here - how might an inquiry into the socio-psycho
surround be generative for writers i wonder ?

experimental writing lack formal criteria ?") keeps coming up, as though
there were too strong a nostalgic attachment to a criterion-view of art for
even the initiated to part with such (Solomonic) judgments.

there is much here to ponder
and much that my original posting
so full of questions cdn't be seen to lead to
until Jeffrey intervened in this way

so too my response is now twice
removed from my original posting
& wants (or i want for it)
to break free of that original context

it seems that one of the contemporary scene's
biggest dance steps in responding to any ideas
is to search a bit
and find something in the way of a binary
(it's always there, no?)
and then to assert that such things aren't useful
or worthwhile
or whatever
whether thru reference to derrida
or someone else

and i think that this is useful at times
to remind us that ~life is not made up
of binary oppositions~ or something
equally quotable

and i confess i've used this tactic myself
just as i've used binary terms

but i think that when one takes the route
of critiquing the binary
that some things can get lost in the shuffle

by which i mean to say that i don't think
as perhaps Jeffrey does (?)
(and i know other have said)
that dyads (binaries if you prefer)
are useless

instead i wd suggest that a better critique
of dyadic thinking wd be one which didn't
attempt to dissolve the opposed sides
by showing their mutual interdependence
but one which illustrated that
monadic dyadic and triadic conceptions
all have utility within specific spheres

such that if i or anyone says
wordsworth is a bad poet   or
pulp fiction is a bad movie   or
guernica is a bad painting
  that the 1st thing we wd do well to realize
is that none of these statements
is really proposing a grand scale of values
in which any of these things
might be seen of as exemplifying
a category of 'badness'

instead we are dealing with one
subject position relative to these things
conceived dyadically rather than triadically
wherein the 'object' in question
wd of necessity be seen as part of a continua
and as enmeshed with its context
such that one might say
"well, within the context
 of 80s screwball comedies
 Police Academy 2
 really isn't as bad as people say"

so while a triadic approach to things
will by most people's standard's
produce a more nuanced
and certainly a more relational
reading of a text or piece of art
this in no way refutes the reality
of dyadic conceptions like good/bad

as such     asking whether
experimental poetry exhibits formal criteria
isn't of necessity a nostalgic move covertly
asking for absolute criteria
and much more of an open question
to the people of this forum

personally i assume that there are
amongst this list those who have
relatively stable formal criteria and those
for who such things are in flux
and those for whom such ideas are utterly foreign
yet i cannot imagine that any of these
attitudes wd preclude their work
from being seen as experimental
nor wd it be so dubbed b/c of any of these things

Jeffrey said lots of other stuff in his post
but i've gone one too long already

Bonnie Parker says to Jennifer


I have a gun and a name.
I will never live in shame.
I ride far and wide for my desires.
The girls come fast, their lives are fires.
I know my fame goes far and wide.
The boys don't take my fame in stride.
I'm naked now, but for the gun.
To make you see the Holy One.
If you so much as turn from me.
My gun will speak Eternity.
You dream of me, blame it on me.
Your sex is me, my gun you'll see.
I'm only here to beg, obey.
The gun makes sure I'm here to stay.
I'm your Girl now and in the future.
You have a lovely tender creature.
Without the gun I'm everyone.
Your flesh and mine, we're on the run.
There's earth and sky, nowhere to hide.
My gun's my friend, my gun's my bride.
When I was young I thought of guns.
I lived and died, 'neath angry suns.
It's healthy, true, the way to be.
All problems solved, I'm young and free.
The gun is me, the gun is you.
Desires flow like bullets too.
We're here and now, we're only One.
I yearn and cry, this is my gun.

I have a gun and a Name.
I will never die in shame.

Is it because seize your body in the middle of the night twist it beyond
belief that you came naked and broken to me? Why do you say you might want
to rid? What makes you yearn and cry that you want the dreams to go away?
Earlier you said seize your body in the middle of the night twist it
beyond belief? What happened when your skin burns your body is charred?
Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your desires have to do with some
girls or with this. Is it because of your life that you say girls or boys
nothing? You mentioned that you would like to rid? Is it because of the
boys you hang around with that you are going through all this? Why not?
Does it bother you that I ask that? Why not? Please please don't ever
leave me. What makes you believe shut up? Are you sure that seize your
body in the middle of the night twist it beyond belief? How do you
reconcile your nakedness? Are you afraid of that? Is it because of any
fantasies you have of me that you say you will violate yourself? Earlier
you said you would like to rid? Perhaps and now I exhibit my frocks - this
has some girl to do with any fantasies I have of you that I say I will
violate myself? Do you really think some girl has nothing to do with
anything? You mentioned that seize your body in the middle of the night
twist it beyond belief? Oh oh I do see so... Well, what makes you think
this is so? Possibly and guess - I show you my flesh - your sex life are
related to this. This is a healthy and so true way of thinking. Can you
elaborate on that and look at me? Are you annoyed that you, too, may die
someday? Is it because of perversions you have that you say your skin is
seared off? Oh oh yes, ahhh...  Why do you say this is so? I am in love
with your obsession with this topic!

I apologize in advance if this is an inappropriate use of band-width on
the list.

I am moving to Philadelphia July 1 and I've found a wonderful Center
City apt. within walking distance to U.Penn.  I need to find a housemate,
however, in order to get this place.  The share of the rent is $250 each,
plus utilities.  It's large, has lots of light, on-street parking,
hardwoord floors, and whoever takes this with me gets two rooms (a bedroom
and an office/workspace) plus their own bathroom (it's a 2 br, 2 ba, 2
floor apt. in a house).

Anyone living in Philly, or like me, going to Philly, who is interested
should e-mail me privately so we can talk further.

Thanks,
Chris Devenney

Underlying his recent remarks to the List -- but more explicitly in his
_RHIZOME_ article -- Standard makes a very original & interesting gesture
towards a sociological analysis of poetry along the lines of Pierre
Bourdieu's critique of  the "habitas" -- that is to say, the sense of one's
place which emerges through the processes of differentiation in social space
that maintain and create prestige while confirming various heirarchies of
belief, value, and so on.  This is not at all developed, as Standard
acknowledges in the article, & it is also at odds with those remarks of his
that, as Brian Kim Stefans points out, can be interpreted in ways that show
that Standard is himself implicated, to a degree that he may not be fully
conscious of, in a set of dispositions, or practices, that actually contest
*for* rather than *against* the priviledges he wants to expose.  Standard's
attitude toward Language Poetry, far from attempting a degree of objectivity
or dispassion is clearly *interested*, and reveals the Oedipal anxieties that
are a very familiar pattern in inter-generational conflicts for predominance
-- but after all he is only as unfair to the Language Poets as they were to
their precursors.  In any case, Standard's recent and highly favorable review
of Stefan's _FREE SPACE COMIX_ in _LINGO_ seems, in light of his _RHIZOME_
article, somewhat problematic, -- as well as the appearance there of numerous
Language Poets featured in all three issues of the magazine.

Stefans' remarks are in fact quite perceptive in many other ways,
particularly re Bernstein.  However, to the extent that Language Poetry made
the attempt to  "talk back to power" a central -- the central? -- aspect of
their aesthetic, it certainly seems more than fair to point out the
compromises, blind spots, and hypocrisies in their negotations with
institutional priviledge.  It's not quite good enough for them simply to
agonize over the extent to which they now participate in reproducing
relations of prestige, etc. when such questions, owing to the premises from
which Language Poetry develped, are *uniquely relevant* to the work itself --
at least as the Language Poets themselves explicate their work (though here I
would agree with Charles Altieri's comments in the Hank Lazer book that
Stefans recommends Standard read -- that Language Poetry is a lot more
interesting than its own self-presentation).  Nor has the relative and
qualified success of Language Poetry been something which, as Stefans seems
to argue, simply happened.  The various stories I've heard about the
background of _In the American Tree_ would surprise a lot of people I think.
**All of which is not to say of course that it is not a good thing that some
of the Language Poets have cleared a space for themselves in the academy, or
that their work should not attract as wide a readership, & as much critical
attention as possible.** But it *is* to begin to understand why many aspects
of Language Poetry may not seem entirely sufficient to the kinds of poets
Standard describes as unaligned.

Stefans writes: "I think that [Standard's essay is] part of a trend that I
sense very strongly write now in poets who are, say, generally within my
age range, some older some younger (so that would be mid-twenties to
mid-thirties) who are prone to making very over-arching, "emotional" (most
more often hysterical) statements about how the Language Poets have
completely subtracted a certain variable -- "emotion" -- from the poetic
equation in America. . . .   I would suggest [that Standard read] Charles'
exchange with Louis Simpson in . . . the Politics of Poetic Form, in which
his ideas on "emotion"
are most misunderstood and most strongly stated."

Yes, Bernstein is brilliant as usual (& again the book itself is a
fascinating "failure" -- Vendler, Altieri, Perloff and the others talk at
each other, more than to each other -- though God only knows what "success"
could possibly mean in these circumstances).  And  yes, "emotion" is quite a
complex thing & it is certainly not absent from Language Poetry.  However, it
is easy to understand the "trend" Stefans speaks about in non-hysterical
terms.  It seems obvious for example that, as a result of their critique of
the mediated & conventional character of passional language, the Language
Poets made a wide range of aesthetic experience unavailable to experimental
writing.  It is interesting to see how, for instance, Bruce Andrews begins
his Linebreak interview by attempting to account for/explain away his early
love poems.  Among emerging poets, however-- at least in my limited
experience -- the attitude toward Language Poetry's disabling of a wide range
of traditional aesthetic resources is not at all the same as Louis Simpson's.
 This is too large an issue to go into now & my post is already much too
long.  Suffice it to say that the anatgonism to Language Poetry in an essay
like Standard's has less to do with fundamental ideological disagreements
than  about the emphases it chooses to make & the contradictions it chooses
to ignore -- & there are obvious contradictions in the aesthetics of Language
poetry as well which are themselves strategically repressed.  The contextual
bias of Language Writing -- its overwhelming emphasis on the role of subjects
in the situation of communication seems a very difficult topic for further
aesthetic development (an observation which, I realize, needs to be qualified
to a much greater extent than I have time to do here).  To the Language Poets
this must seem like giving up ground already fought over and won, but new
negotiations & reconsiderations of, among other things, the place of the
emotions in poetry, & the scope & variety of their presentation seem to me
especially timely now.

Who'd want to be saddled with that term?? Well......I would.  It's a
gesture of self-defense--an aikido move.  See my essay "Confessions of a

sometimes i wonder and sometime i understand that i'm a delusional poet, a
poet who imagines what is said(soberly, seriously, wierdly or funnily) is
important and that sooner or later if you're a practictioner of poetry you
discover that poetry makes demands of its own, hello there poet you may
think you're looking in the mirror but knock knock us ghosts ooooo oooooo
are looking back at you through the doorway which you think is the mirror
we may be dead but we're part of the audience you're writing for and your
audience expects hell requires more than the self agrandizement you might
have imagined when you first stuck quill to parchment. One of those
requirements, that Cavalcanti and Pound and Sor Juana and Borges and
Levertov and Duncan and HD and Stein and Akmatova and Cvetaeva and
Mayakovsky and Cummings and Catullus and Ovid and Olson and Creeley and
Sorrentino and Dorothy Trujillo Lusk, and Kevin Davies and Tom Raworth and
in my audience have always required of me is to remind the living
practitioners and appreciators alike that no matter the constant
reiteration of the platitude that poetry is a solitary art it is no such
thing. You can't write poetry without reading it and sooner or later if you
read it you're going to find there are poems out there (beside your
own)that delight you, that outrage you, that put your own work to shame,
and i've always taken it as my duty to shine a little light on this work,
that's why when i perform i like to begin reading work by others that's
particularly exciting to me at the time.  does anyone else feel this way?
you'd be hard pressed to tell it if you were looking for notice of the
launch of The Recovery of the Public World.
Sometimes i think it's a conspiracy against Robin Blaser, whose magnum opus
The Holy Forest, one of the truly great books of 20th century literature,
and surely one of the most important books of American Poetry published in
the 90's got zero notice in the New York Times Book Review.
Maybe The Recovery of the Public World, Essays on Poetics in Honour of
Robin Blaser edited by Charles Watts and Edward Byrne and published
handsomely by Talon Books more than makes up for that lack.
 The launch at the Western Front in Vancouver was another standing room
only affair, 150 people packed into the Grand Luxe Ballroom on the second
floor. Ted Byrne, Karl Ziegler, Peter Quartermain, Miriam Nichols, Sharon
Thesen, George Bowering and Robin all spoke, Robin read from the libretto
he's currently working on for The Last Supper and opera by Birdwhistle?
forgive me somebody help me here i'm not up on my British Composers that
while premiere next year.  Most spoke in fond remembrance of Charles who
died last year, sad loss, but as i read it i think of him up on Burnaby
Mountain sometimes until near midnight kerning every page of this
magnificent production. I'm going to try to give it the attention it
deserves over the next month or so speaking of specific essays, it's a big
task, it's a big poetry and many important writers including Phyllis Webb,
Steve McCaffery, Lisa Robertson, Daphne Marlatt, George Stanley, Michael
Ondaatje, Anne Waldman, Leslie Scalapino, Peter Gizzi, Jed Rasula, Susan
Howe, Rachel Blau Duplessis, Kevin Killian, Nathaniel Tarn, Steve Dickison,
Norma Cole, Bruce Boone, Peter Quartermain and more have essays in this 464
page collection.
But here i want to remind you that poets are composed of equal parts of
bravery and folly, so i don't want you to wait to hear what i'm going to
say, i want you to rush right in there and let us know what you think of
this reflection of the devotion of both Charles and Robin. If you don't
hear from me, it's because I'm going crazy trying to find the three months
arrears in my telephone bill and internet provider bill.  If you've got a
job for me, my grandchildren are growing up, I'm ready to leave the
wilderness, let me know

love,

>>>I can't remember where this quote from T.S. Eliot on Pound occurs.

Eliot asks this question at the end of his 1928 review of Pound's
_Personae_.  You can of course find the full reference in Gallup's
bibliography.

Randy Prunty quoting George Lakoff on Gins and Arakawa;
  "The increasing violence and destruction
   in the world - physical, ecological,
   economic, social, and emotional - are
   all a product of our present modes of
   thought. If the cruelty is to end, our
   concepts must change.  Since concepts
   are physically encoded in the brain and
   grounded in the body, our brains and
   bodies must change.  If art is to play a
   role for the good, it must disrupt our
   concepts, our normal ways of
   functioning - our brains and our bodies.
   Art as disruption is art as a moral force.
   Disruption is an aesthetic experience,
   and an aesthetic experience of this kind
   is inherently moral.  Moreover,
   disruptive art on a large-enough scale
   will be sufficient to reverse our destiny,
   so that the violence and destruction
   can end."

and to this Jacques Debrot replies saying (among other things);

   "But one of the difficulties here,
    in respect of poetry, seems to me
    precisely one of "sufficiency of scale."
    Nor is disruption something
    diametrically opposed to violence &
    destruction"

next in the queue Mark Prejsnar intervenes suggesting that Jacques is
overburdening the term "disruption" in the Lakoff piece - but upon
reflection and a good third reading of what Jacques is saying i don't think
he's overburdening the term - simply indicating that it might also have
descriptive acuity relative to violence and thus that 'disruption' in an of
itself is not anything we can value positively in every situation - of
course Mark is also right in saying that in context the sort of disruption
Lakoff discusses *is* meant to be a good thing - or to state it less
dyadically the interventions via art that Arakawa and Gins enact are meant
to shake up the fixity of our notions whether they be perceptual or
conceptual

Mark and Jacques also both assume that the two voice post questioning
whether poetry is telic or not was meant as a response to the rhizome piece
- and while i know that the 1st question of poetry as 'telic' arose there it
wasn't my intention that they be linked - the two voice piece, as Randy
noted in his post was of two minds as well more an attempt to see what two
possible perspectives among countless ones i didn't think of might have to
offer

but Jacques does link this to the essay and brings up a question that i find
interesting and a little bit troubling as well

Debrot (with my parsings);
        "...the problem it seems to me
        is rather that, at a time when
        the history of art is *arguably*
        over, & the most extreme
        aesthetic violence --Artaud's say
        -- is merely a "style" that one
        cannot avoid "quoting"
        (...) can art really be said to
        have retained a capacity for
        disruption?  (...) S. Schaefer
        problematizes the continuity
        between radical poetic theory
        and practice.  This aspect of
        his argument seems persuasive,
        particularly in the context of
        Prunty's post, as no poem seems
        likely to come close to approaching
        the extremity of the aesthetic
        experience Lakoff describes."

? but is Lakoff describing a fait accompli or discussing the motivation for
a work of art ? has everything really already been done ? how cd this be ?
and if it was the case how cd we know ? what wd assuming such to be the case
leave us with ? or rather, what use is there for an analysis that says ~the
history of art is *arguably* over~ ? wd it remove all anxieties about one's
place relative to tradition ? (what if you weren't anxious ? cd you hang
onto history then ?)

i think Jacques cuts to the quick in saying that there is a problem with the
"sufficiency of scale" and as such i think that Standard's question about
whether the theory and practice match-up is not incoherent or meaningless by
any means but i wonder exactly how many writers or more generally artists
who have been motivated by political/social concerns *in any way* cd
withstand a litmus wherein every goal they've espoused must be found to have
been achieved thru their art

but Jacques continues with this;
        "But I think his concern with establishing parameters for aesthetic
judgement have merit -- not as
prescriptions, or "standards" -- but as a means of asking -- for framing the
question -- "What is the possibility of poetry today?" since it is not, I
don't think, [a] sort of Antinomian practice..."

And Mark asks; "What parameters does Jacques agree we must adhere to??"

and i find that i'd like to hear some answer to this myself but i don't
myself see how establishing parameters cd do anything other than limit "the
possibility of poetry today" - and further i fear much more of this does
something like what Randy was saying; it "put[s] too much pressure on those
little ink spots on the paper."

New From Avec Books
Series/Mnemonic
poems
Trane DeVore

In a sequence of short poems rendered in refined yet sensual language,
DeVore's close scrutiny encompasses both the corporeal and the temporal
worlds. Like Proust's madeleine, objects and elements in nature ignite
remembrance and desire. The poems in Series/ Mnemonic are deftly
humorous--but also elegant observations about memory and the physical
world.

=89
The accomplishment in Series/ Mnemonic  is doing something plain with
cool, careful observation. This work sits well. Thoughtfully composed,
simply presented "it smolders in the round."

-Laura Moriarty

"Exactitudes of hand & mind & eye." This is the one who is particular &
exemplary, measure & epitome, personal but never blinded by that. Trane
DeVore's poetry of one's situations is purely beautiful, a lasting relief
to such as it incisively indites. There haven't been many "first books" as
fine & accomplished & meanwhile as promising.

-David Bromige

DeVore's poetry grapples with traditional matters-memory, desire,
beauty-in a method which is distinct and contemporary. Moreover, in an age
where irony has been the dominant figure, I find his post-ironic language
refreshing, bold and new. This work is playful, sensuous, spare, elegant,
rigorous, and compelling.

-D.A. Powell

Trane DeVore was born in Rescue, California. His work has appeared in
numerous publications-most recently in Prosodia, tight, and the late
Exquisite Corpse-and he has worked extensively with various incarnations
of the Lingua Quartet. He is currently at U.C. Berkeley doing graduate
work in English.

Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Cool, there are times I hunger to see you. But to begin, a
Nikuko: discourse, on exile. Mountains, shrines, Nakasukawabata,
Nikuko: continue to haunt me. I am bound by the name. Streams. What is
Nikuko: the moment of meditation. Lasting, until the body bends.
Nikuko: Double-clapping; there are so many gods they forget my face.
Nikuko: Or the dancing, gestures, movement of the double balls at the
Nikuko: matsuri. There are lines and threads across this earth,
Nikuko: forgotten. Demarcations of areas, bounded, which empty me
Nikuko: internally. What is not lost, moment of a vast gone world. The
Nikuko: gods gather in great whirlwinds; they approach a coast and are
Nikuko: turned back. They live with the turning. They gather at the
Nikuko: boundary and look across. They see whatever may be absent but
Nikuko: it is beyond their reach; they have no arms and legs and their
Nikuko: voices do not carry them farther. Vast cataclysms of orange
Nikuko: energy sweep from their hungry faces. They speak unknown
Nikuko: languages and even I do not know their languages. I did not
Nikuko: know nor ask why they are gods. Now there are questions framed
Nikuko: by the whirlwind and the boundary. The sky here has no energy.
Nikuko: Or rather is all energy, parceled by lines determined by a
Nikuko: metric space. It is spectral blue. Sometimes at night arms and
Nikuko: legs of kami push out through my skin, distort me. Painful
Nikuko: partial births; in the morning I look and see nothing
Nikuko: emerges. I would turn and turn and wind the thread. I stare
Nikuko: into a space I can only see as schizophrenic. I would divide
Nikuko: and turn into an other traveler. She would come with me, arms
Nikuko: and legs in arms and legs, her head in my head, her womb in
Nikuko: mine, body and body, mind and mind. At night she seems real.
Nikuko: The gods gather and look around but they can't see that
Nikuko: far. There are mists and whirlpools, enormous storms at the
Nikuko: boundary. Whatever they murmur, truth and magic, I cannot hear
Nikuko: clearly. I speak and speak and nothing happens. That is the
Nikuko: truth of exile - the speaking, nothing happens.
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko:
Nikuko: Everywhere that I will be, there I will listen to you, O
Nikuko: Gods. Always the texts to be read, forwards and backwards.
Nikuko: Always the application of formula. The words pour over me. I
Nikuko: will always belong to the beginnings of hermeneutics; I am
Nikuko: always exiled from speech, from language. Interpretation is
Nikuko: exile's result. Once I did rend myself by the waters of
Nikuko: Babylon; now it is the rivers through Fukuoka that gather my
Nikuko: tears. I am always already at a loss; it is the loss of the
Nikuko: world, the dull lid of the night collapsed and soldered hard
Nikuko: to the exigencies of the real. This hard earth, here, does not
Nikuko: support me. Memory cannot move among the truth of threads
Nikuko: connecting one to another. Not every space has a home. There
Nikuko: are spaces that cry, spaces that weep, spaces that mourn. My
Nikuko: spaces mourn; I listen to my spaces crying and weeping. I
Nikuko: repeat the texts, magic. The formula are useless, gods
Nikuko: suspended in the whirlwind. Every line spoken, here, for
Nikuko: you. I can't understand your replies. Give me a ticket to
Nikuko: Kyushu. I will fill my belly and give birth to many dolls.

Nikuko: Now I am very tired and I will put my sleepy head on this very
Nikuko: nice pillow, so downy and comforting, and I will play pleasing
Nikuko: music and my lights are very low. And I can hardly hear the
Nikuko: traffic outside, there is the sound of shrine bells somewhere
Nikuko: in the distance, and I wake up, and there is the sound of
Nikuko: traffic outside and there are church bells disturbing my tiny
Nikuko: sleep, and I wake up, and there is the sound of traffic and
Nikuko: the sound of a muezzin chanting. My lovely sleepy head is so
Nikuko: very restless, it is the head of a refugee, it moves from soft
Nikuko: place to soft place and I am so glad it is not a war but the
Nikuko: sound of temple bells, and I will have a wonderful place to
Nikuko: sleep tonight, and I wake up, and I am so snuggly warm, and I
Nikuko: love your language, and I fall back asleep "for just another
Nikuko: minute."

Nikuko: I am a picture and a frame which is the picture, and now I am
Nikuko: another picture and another frame; this is a film story of my
Nikuko: life and I am another picture. I speak here and then
Nikuko: I speak here and you can follow me speaking through time after

Nikuko: behind me and a woman beneath me; that there is a frame behind
Nikuko: me and a frame beneath me. And this is the frame which is the
Nikuko: film and you will have this film while "I am not those among
Nikuko: them who are there to be counted," nor am I "one of those who
Nikuko: shall remain unaccounted," nor further, "one of those who
Nikuko: remain unaccounted for," you will have this in order, as I am
Nikuko: a picture and a frame and now I am saying this and now I am
Nikuko: saying this. For "I shall remain unaccountable," and "a
Nikuko: presence in your midst," and "you shall not hear the voice of
Nikuko: the prophet," and "there is a gift of the letters."

Subject:      Long response to Jacques
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is Mark Prejsnar; (our new home account has only Erika's name on it;
which causes some confusion...)



I think Jacques Debrot's recent interventions attempt to strike a useful
balance, regarding some of the preceding exchanges.  He is wrong on a
number of points, though:

Regarding Standard's interesting essay in Rhizome 3, he writes:

  "Standard's
attitude toward Language Poetry, far from attempting a degree of objectivity
or dispassion is clearly *interested*, and reveals the Oedipal anxieties that
are a very familiar pattern in inter-generational conflicts for predominance
-- but after all he is only as unfair to the Language Poets as they were to
their precursors."

Now i'm sorry, but this is just plain silly.  Unlike the important polemics
of the 1970s, SS's piece says *nothing* helpful or accurate about the older
poets he wants to dis... His primary rant, is that they have "seized
power," by dishonestly manipulating left-leaning theory and polemics.  I
think (and hope) that most Listmembers realize that Silliman and Bernstein
and Hejinian and Scalapino do not "hold power".. That simply suggests how
defensive and out-of-touch Standard is.  Hell, Robert Pinsky, the FDR of
mediocre laureates (going beyond traditional term limits, ya know) holds
damn little POWER.  Poets, like say jazz musicians, are really not part of
a *power structure* in any meaningful sense.  SS is mainly having problems
with ressentiment, as is indicated by phrases like "Marjorie Perloff and
her cronies."  As someone who is not nearly important enuff to be part of
Standard's target group, i'd like to testify from the sidelines that this
is uh, sad.  And sure not appropriate to a poet and editor who has done the
fine stuff SS has in the past.  As many jazz musicians of my acquaintance
do, i think poets should have a more collegial and comradely tone, than is
contained in petty factionalism such as SS's piece projects.  Like them
we're part of a subculture that doesn't get many resources allocated to
it... We'll flourish best thru mutual aid.


Another of Jacques's remarks:

  "However, to the extent that Language Poetry made
the attempt to  "talk back to power" a central -- the central? -- aspect of
their aesthetic, it certainly seems more than fair to point out the
compromises, blind spots, and hypocrisies in their negotations with
institutional priviledge.  It's not quite good enough for them simply to
agonize over the extent to which they now participate in reproducing
relations of prestige, etc. when such questions, owing to the premises from
which Language Poetry develped, are *uniquely relevant* to the work itself --"


Well here we need a major statement (and i'm not being facetious) analyzing
what these compromises, blind spots and hypocrisies are.  Clearly JD is
throwing in here with SS's "Perloff cronies siezing power" thing.  Just
WHAT are these two talking about?? can SOMEONE possibly elucidate what they
think they are saying??  Are Silliman and Perelman and Bernstein guilty of
this rather lurid and extreme series of misdeeds, because they have *taught
in universities* ??  Because they have five or six books (out of many
dozens) that were published by university presses??  Because they have been
mentioned in the NYT Book Review more times than Standard?? (a total of 7
or 8, i'd guess, over quite a few years).  I have no personal stake in the
public image of the poets Standard and Jacques are accusing of compromises,
blind spots, hyposcrisy, "relations of prestige"  (now just what is
that??)---i have never met any of 'em, and seldom spoken with them over
e-mail.  It just seems to me that SS and JD are badly confused about values
and about reality.  If they could put a tenth of this invective into
weakening the capitalism fee-market system and other structures of *really*
hurtful power, we would all have moved appreciably closer to the promised
land, that's fer sure!

Finally:   "It seems obvious for example that, as a result of their critique of
the mediated & conventional character of passional language, the Language
Poets made a wide range of aesthetic experience unavailable to experimental
writing."

Now here Jacques makes an interesting point.  But obviously the load of
defensive rhetoric toward the poets of the last 30 years is just an
inappropriate response...As is the absurd phrasing:  no one has made
anything "unavailable."  If this is a problem for JD, he knows what to do:
make his mark by rev'ing up the ol' computer and spinning out some
passional writing.  Koch said to Ashbury (if i have the well-known anecdote
right) not to be upset at all the strong writing coming out in mags:  "more
for us to steal!"  To skew the joke somewhat, if older poets have made
something underappreciated or underutilized,  then for Jacques the obvious
point of view should be   "more for me to set right in my own work!"

Also take it from me: drop this "experimental" crap.  If you think yer
writing is just writing, you might find it easier to start gettin'
"passional"... Just a personal peeve.

passionally,
Mark Prejsnar

Hi it's Kevin Killian.  Poetics List has probably heard the news, but the
poet and filmmaker James Broughton, one of the original "New American
Poets," died in Port Townsend WA at age 85 on Monday May 17.

He could be a bit acerbic and he was kind of a nut about "joy" this and
"joy" that but oh, I'll miss him.  Dodie and I got him to dig out his
long-ago "Maidens" play which I had heard about doing research into the
Spicer book, and we printed it in our zine about 2 years ago, here it is
again for those who didn't it

MISSION to GOMORRAH

This play was especially written to amuse poet friends
and was performed by them for the first time in April 1958.

Rowena Monkenberg       Helen Adam
Mrs. Lily Trump Eve Triem
Flippety Dick   Jess
Major Beatrice  Madeline Gleason
Dr. Agon        Robert Duncan


[Scene: a desert.  Enter ROWENA MONKENBERG in a flowing gown, Mrs. LILY
TRUMP in a cocktail dress, and FLIPPETY DICK in shorts.]

ROWENA. I see no city ahead.
        Charred sand for endless miles.
        No distant mountain.  Not even a lizard.
        How will we survive across this wasteland?

LILY.   My feet hurt.  I shouldn't have worn so much jewelry.

FLIP.   When in doubt, wiggle less and breathe more!

ROWENA. This heat shrivels my Scottish bones.
        The only water is this stinking green pond.

FLIP.   Before using internally, or any other way,
        see if your solution needs a good shake.

ROWENA. I hate you, Mr. Flippety Dick!
        I can't forgive you for ruining the picnic.
        Why did you kill that adorable tarantula?

FLIP.   I will kill, and I will make to live.
        I am the Dance of Shiva!

LILY.   My friend Mrs. Pines, Mrs. Dora Pines,
        saved string in boxes for forty-one years.
        One morning she opened them all up
        and hung herself.

ROWENA. O, the ugly passions of mankind, they poison me!

LILY.   Dora Pines couldn't stand it,
        the endless humdrumming next door,
        not another minute.

FLIP.   This is a poor excuse for a desert.
        Where are the saints?  Where are the slot machines?

LILY.   Are we really on the right road to Gomorrah?

ROWENA. The last signpost said: Nirvana 25,000 miles.

LILY.   I didn't want to come on this expedition.
        But the Major is so determined.
        Determined to establish her colony on sacred ground.
        What are she and the doctor doing?

ROWENA (looking off).

        The beasts!  They're swatting!
        They're swatting the tsetse flies!

FLIP.   That sphinx we just passed in the sand-
        I asked her a riddle.

LILY.   Why do you talk to every girl you see?
        You're just trying to break my heart.
        Even my husband is more thoughtful of me than you are.

FLIP.   Said I to the Sphinx, said I:
        What is it that is born in a vacuum
        lives in an air-conditioner
        and dies in a doldrum?

LILY.   I give up!

FLIP.   Said the Sphinx to me, said the Sphinx:
        'You gaseous lump,
        how dare you ask me riddles!"
        said the Sphinx to me.

LILY.   The minx!

 ROWENA (singing to herself).

        So comely Maud has gone to her grave
                for the sorry love of a sailor.
        She hanged herself on the blackthorn bough
                because her Johnny failed her.

        Her cat of black, her golden finch
                are friendless, left to grieve her.
        And her Johnny Boy of the seven seas
                is still a gay deceiver.

LILY.   Flippety dear, I wish we were back in
        that dark cocktail lounge, sitting on that soft divan
        with plenty of that hard liquor.

FLIP.   All the girls I dream of
        have names beginning with Ann.
        Anima, Anemia, Angina, Anesthesia . . .

LILY (sighing).

        O Man, where is thy sting?

SLIP (suddenly passionate).

        When honey dripped from the trees
        in the once-golden orchard of Man,
        happily sucked they like bees
        those sunlit children of Pan.
        Like lions of love lived they
        where gold apples over-ran,
        juicily roaring at play
        in the bedfellow Eden of Man.

[Enter MAJOR BEATRICE, followed by DOCTOR AGON.  She is wearing
mountaineering outfit, he is in mourning.]

MAJOR B.        No, doctor, no!  I haven't time to kiss you!
        We are on a pilgrimage.
        I need your science by my side,
        not your whiskers in my face.
        We must persist, or we are undone.

DR. A.  All errors are the want of love.
        The Wheel never breaks, the break never heals.

MAJOR B.        I have a mission.  Don't you?
        Doesn't everybody have a mission?
        Don't you believe that sublime affirmations
        shine in the dark heart of the world?

DR. A.  Beyond this emptiness is there any bright oasis?
        Are Truth, Beauty, and Goodness
        ever found where we look for them?

LILY.   Major, I'm thirsty.  Where are we?

MAJOR B.        We're not there yet.

ROWENA. There's a salty smell.  Mightn't Gomorrah be near?

DR. A.  Sand.  A pond of stinking water.  A tombstone.
        Looks like the kingdom of Ozymandias.

FLIP.   Is hell even hotter than this?

MAJOR B.        'Thus saith the Lord,
        the people which were left of the sword
        found grace in the desert.'

DR. A.  It is also said that if a pig is thrown into deep water,
        when he tries to save himself from drowning
        he cuts his throat with his own sharp hooves.

ROWENA. O Doctor Agon, how could you?
        That dear little pig!  You're a beast!

MAJOR B.        Take heart, my brave pilgrims.
        The first condition is:
        make yourself humble as dust and ashes.

DR. A.  Major of my dreams,
        If I were not entranced by the tip of your nose,
        I would be back home in my Guatemalan hammock.

MAJOR B.        This is no time for fiddle faddle.
        Look at that warped cloud!

DR. A.  Must I surrender my attachment to
        the human creature and her 10,000 things?

LILY.   When I was first married
        my husband kept the cow in the bathtub.
        He still keeps his tools in it.

DR. A.  Maybe I could be of help, Mrs. Trump.
        Here's my card.

MAJOR B.        Doctor, you know what we are suffering from.
        Why don't you help us?

LILY.   There's a lot of it going around.

ROWENA. There's something wrong with the stars.

DR. A.  There isn't any cure.

MAJOR B.        There has to be!

FLIP (singsong).

        Sippety syrupy sob,
        the corn is off the cob.
        Baba Yaga going gaga
        cut off the balls of Bob.

[ROWENA shrieks.]

LILY.   Falling, falling . . .

DR. A.  The rain it raineth every day.

MAJOR B.        Where falls the heavenly dew, to lave
        the soiled black body in the grave?

LILY.   Destruction!

ROWENA. Damnation!

FLIP.   Disfigurement . . .

MAJOR B (beginning a blues song, which the others join).

        It's gotten out of hand
        It's coming down all around
        It's falling out all over me,
        I've got those radioactive, feeling inactive,
        feverish fallout blues!

DR. A.  My burning baby . . . .

MAJOR B.        It's falling from above
        but not from Heaven.
        It's just coming down on me.

DR. A.  . . . and me . . .

ALL.    All over us!  It's scandal-ous!

LILY.   Ruin-ous!

ROWENA. Poison-ous!

FLIP.   Igneous! . . .

MAJOR B.        And I get the feeling I'm falling,
        I'm falling out too . . .

DR. A.  My fallen angel . . .

MAJOR B.        I'm falling out with you.

DR. A.  Then we're together . . .

DR. A. and MAJOR B (singing together).

        I'm falling out-with-you.

MAJOR B.        I'm falling out of love
        I'm falling out of shape
        I'm falling out of luck . . .

DR. A.  I'm out of my mind . . .

LILY.   Out of joint . . .

FLIP.   Out of kilter . . .

ROWENA. Out of order . . .

DR. A.  Out of the question . . .

 MAJOR B.       It's falling out-
        of all proportion
        and it's all coming down on me.

DR. A.  . . . and me.

ALL.    All over us!  It's blasphem-ous!

LILY.   Villain-ous!

ROWENA. Insidi-ous!

FLIP.   Nucle-us!

MAJOR B.        I've got those unattractive, overly active,
        damn hot fallout blues!

[End of song.]

FLIP (spoken).

        I'm sick.

ROWENA. The poor dragonflies!  O the rats and fleas!

DR. A.  Death is the thing we carry in our hands.

LILY.   Death is the thing I see in my mirror.

FLIP.   Death is all right for the other fellow.

ROWENA. Death is the loiterer I do not trust.

MAJOR B.        Where falls the heavenly dew, to lave
        the soiled black body in the grave?

DR. A.  Death is a womb, like sleep and dream.

MAJOR B.        The seed, the seed, the renewing grace . . .

DR. A.  Out of Death's blackened phallus
        bursts a beauty of sunrise flower.

MAJOR B.        Death is the beginning we fear to know.

FLIP.   What's so great about staying alive?

ROWENA (singing).

        The mountains are all looking down, down, down,
        the fair lady Margaret to see,
        how her devilish act did startle the town
        when she hanged her two babes on a tree, tall tree . . .

LILY.   My feet hurt.  They're so hot.

MAJOR B.        Take heart again, my pilgrims.
        You have been humbled enough by dust and ashes.
        Now arise.  Rise to the uplift stair!
        We have longer to go in the shortest of time
        and there's no way out but up!

DR. A.  How far will the Eternal Feminine
        lead us eternally upward?

LILY.   Will we get to a nice cocktail lounge?

FLIP.   Will I have to put up with angels?

ROWENA. I want to see Gomorrah!
        I want to see the bones of burning sinners!

MAJOR B.        All that fails we witness and denounce.
        So let us risk the only bliss that counts.
        Come, take adventure!  Let the sorrow go!
        This wasteful desert is a passing show.

[She herds them off.]

because i am a funny man(forgive me for saying so) and Canadian poetry is
some of the funniest poetry every,  i thought i'd begin my examination of
the marvelous production, Charles Watts and Ted Byrne and Talon Books have
given us, The Recovery of the Public World, Essays on Poetics in Honour of
Robin Blaser, with the Peter Quartermain essay The Mind as Frying Pan:
Robin Blaser's Humour. Quartermain's main concern is with the sequence of
poems The Truth is Laughter, which arises first in the book Syntax, which
was in my thinking the book where he became a Canadian Poet, assimilating
the powerful writing of Gilbert, Coleman, McCaffery and McFadden and the
book where he gave up his perfectionism and jettisoned the residue of fear
lingering from the operatic censure of his companions in San Francisco and
began to let the poems flow through him without elaborate tinkering. I
remember visiting Duncan soon after the launch of Syntax and saying Robin's
finally said farewell to the poetry engraved in stone and Robert rightly
saying: Is that what he said, or what you said." I had to laugh, he caught
me. Quartermain says:
The main drift of my argument is very simple indeed and really quite
obvious. It goes like this: that Blaser is a very funny man, blessed
(cursed) with great wit, a great sense of mischief, and a great outrage.
That it is precisely through humour, through laughter(closely related as it
is to the cough), that two realms can meet in this, the only world we've
got. And the realms? the realm of the body, where as Allen Ginsberg reminds
us we are simply meat talking to meat; and the realm of the spirit, also
known as the world of the imagination, as deeply rooted into our
historicised meat as is our body itself.  Laughter--like other syncopes and
interruptions of the breath such as the stutter--dissolves the dualisms of
body and spirit, body and imagination, body and mind. An interjection of
the body, laughter(like the cough) "shocks the cognitive apparatus in its
brute reminder of organic experience"(Appelbaum,8), "deprives the body of
its obedience to the mind"(Clement, 7) Laughter affirms our subjection to
flesh and thus to time, momentarily negating the mind's life so that --as
Blaser's poem puts it--"what's in it is neither true nor false." Laughter
is essential to, indeed, quintessential of Blaser's "fundamental struggle
for the nature of the real."

I might add if you know Blaser, you know his laugh, his unreserved cackle
of delight which i would recognize in the hubbub of Bombay or at the World
Series at Yankee Stadium.

Quartermain's essay, like Peter himself, is unassuming and wide-ranging,
from the renaissance of Alberti, to the cyberworld of Wired, stopping off
en route to collect the thought of Hobbes, Husserl, Pater, Mann, Stein,
Williams, and Giorgio Agamben. Makes me sorry i never took a course with
Peter. I'm hoping now that he's retired and has the opportunity to dance to
his own piping maybe he'll offer one at the Kootenay School of Writing.

I'm not sure, but maybe simply switching the polarity of our terms is a
deconstructive move meant to destroy the binary being employed.  And to say
too that your logic (cancelling the double no) doesn't yield up another
'equal' formulation" no 'no poetry' doesn't = is poetry.  Anti-telos does
not mean "not telos" but "against telos" -- against the sort of suffocating
closure of "making sure there is poetry" -- which sounds an awful lot like
Pinsky's project, a canonization which works to the exlusion of certain
poetries. . .  That's why I prefer to make sure that there's no 'no poetry'
. . . sort of like sustainable agriculture.  The point isn't to make sure
there's food (a quantifiable amount) but to make sure there's no 'no food,'
that the potential for food is always there, unquantifiably.  To see poetry
as a realm of possibility rather than closure.

I think it's wonderfully rich that as you point out

> that 'telos' is an ultimate end and 'telic' is NOT - 'having an
> ultimate end' - but - "tending toward an end"

telos is an ideal only.  it's not a condition that we achieve but 'tend
toward'.  it's a kind of death, no? Like Pinsky's stupid dead poetry
archive, clearly only meant for living people in relation to their impending
death, to squelch their fear of inpending doom and insignificance -- get
your fifteen seconds of videod fame & then you're history with a little h,
your image stashed in some dusty archive that maybe will survive the nuclear
or genetic holocaust & they'll look back on us and say 'look how clever' 'oh
how they must have cared so using words' and 'look how many different shapes
and sizes they came in.'

so, more or less accurate, your summary, till the end:

limited ends?  the this moment needs?  sounds like a bandaid video archive.

What does it mean to construct a coherent feminist poetics that spans
centuries?  Could you elaborate a little here? A poetics is at a basic
level, strategic -- so for centuries, feminists employ the same strategies?
implying that they have the same goal?  Coherent implies either 'it all
sticks together/agrees' or it's all lucid, as opposed to being oppositional
(even from within -- Woolf opposing feminist strategies) or at times
confused or incoherent.  I'm not sure why such a construction is so useful.
It seems very exclusive. The idea that there _is_ an 'outside world,' to
pick on one point in your definition, would seem to exclude all sorts of
lyrics that don't erect that hurdle.  I mean, what's the world 'outside' of?
The poem? Language? Experience?  And in distinguishing between the Romantic
and Sentimental, what of the stuff that doesn't fit?  Is it Other, i.e. not
lyric?  Maybe an unfair question, but, more accurately, why locate *this
particular* distinction? (This obviously relates to its value to
constructing a coherent feminist poetics).

Hi Chris & others listening in.  I’ve been thinking about your query re
Alice Notley’s comments in the COMBO interview (“They’re these people
between about 23 and 36 . . . They’re not very political, and I wish they
were more political”).

You go on to equate the ‘personal’ in ‘the personal is political’ with
‘love,’ but I think you’re mincing here, collapsing the ‘personal’ and ‘love
’ and therefore excluding a crucial issue of the very politics that might be
at stake. In making a distinction I think I can talk to your query.

The political, and I think this holds for Alice, has always to do with the
polis, not in the way that love might, or even in the sense of the
potentially volatile issue of who we might choose to love publically, or
how.  The ‘personal,’ to be ‘political,’ has to engage with and be effected
by the polis.  In the feminist formulation, ‘the personal is political’
meant primarily that the private, the domestic, the ‘female’ experience too
was _as_ political as the public experience, and it wasn’t until the
‘personal’ experience of women (subjection, misogyny, etc.) were shown to
_be_ political, to have everything to do with the workings of the polis,
that the women’s movement as a _political_ movement, could make any headway.

So the personal has as much to do with anger as it does with love, both
overwhelmingly present in Alice’s work.  So I think when she points out the
lack of politicalness, she is addressing the lack of attempting to change
‘the way things are’ in the polis and in poetry via how one experience power
on a 'personal' level.  This is evident for example her essay “Epic and
Women Poets,” which points out that there is something wrong with the polis,
with the way it tells itself stories which exclude the possibility of women’
s stories, and that this has to change.  She realizes these ideas in
Desamere and Alette.  Perhaps that’s what it means to be political: to think
(essay) about a problem and try to solve it (poem).  Writing essays,
editorial matter, and prefaces has always been a part of Alice’s poetic
practice.  I think she might say that editing _Chicago_ while she was
pregnant was a personal _and_ political choice.  Maybe _just_ writing
poetry, in her mind, isn’t political enough?  But maybe the choice to write
poetry is always political, but the politics (now) aren't as visible as they
were say, in the 70s, when she was in/against the context of the women's
movement, and those political issues were heightened.

you write that you're

>  because i respect and admire notley's poetry,
>  and her desire for a return perhaps to a more blatant concern
>  with politics on a content level,

and perhaps bringing in this context frames it helpfully, I hope?

Does anyone have a recording of David Tudor playing Cage's Music of
Changes? I'd be much obliged, and of course cover expenses, if I could get
a hold of a cassette. Did Tudor even record the piece? Can't find it.

I ask re: a Some Trees project. I have the 80s Wergo recording with Herbert
Henck at the keys, but it sounds, well, kind of Teutonic.

Backchannel?

ignore the name above, this is Robert Pinsky speaking. I want to thank you
all for falling into my telos. you didn't notice my telic grasp because you
were busy problematizing your affairs while I went directly to the Love&Fame
Market and earned my fare Uptown. the race is on and I am way ahead. sorry
to gloat. please accept this stirring message as my attempt to bridge the
ever-widening gap:

poetry can only be as good as the people who make it.

friends, we need not be enemies. I think it was William Carlos Williams, the
Dr/Poet of Paterson, who said something like: we don't need poetry half as
much as poetry needs us. by utilizing all our energies we can make something
happen. what do you say, gang, can we work together? we'll leave baseball as
the National Pastime while we concentrate on making more great poems for the
common good.

sincerely,
R Pinksy, official PL of the US of A.

reread this a couple more times and nothing here to argue with or expand.
so, though it may be boring, i agree with the logic and progression of your
ideas.  the quoted part below charges me up!

<<? but is Lakoff describing a fait accompli or discussing the motivation for
a work of art ? has everything really already been done ? how cd this be ?
and if it was the case how cd we know ? what wd assuming such to be the case
leave us with ? or rather, what use is there for an analysis that says ~the
history of art is *arguably* over~ ? wd it remove all anxieties about one's
place relative to tradition ? (what if you weren't anxious ? cd you hang
onto history then ?)>>

Rhizome, however, is still looking for people to help flesh out the review
section for the next issue.  Essays or book reviews.  Books I'd especially
like reviewed would be Aaron Shurin's SELECTED, Jessica Grimm's FRAY, Michael
Davidson's THE ARCADES and Jena Osman's highly disruptive THE CHARACTER.
Now, obviously there's no fear of controversy in Rhizome.  If you got
something to say, here's your chance.  And if you just want to advocate for a
book that you care about, here's your chance.  I think there's room for
something to be said about Martine Bellen's TALES OF MURASAKI as well.

26 Islands
by Dan Featherston
primitive publications

Dan Featherston's "26 Islands" is a contemporary abecedarius, a primer
which demonstrates far more than the moral instruction and alphabet
learning of the traditional model. Put simply, Featherston's 26 verses
expose the working out of the relationships between language and the
reality of perception, conception and power, especially in a situation
where a foreign language supplants a native language. At the same time, he
shows how language cannot help but adapt to the consciousness of living on
an island, as well as to the events of history. The fourth verse, "D is
for Doorways," is a particularly strong evocation of these relationships.
Here is the entry in its entirety:

D is for Doorways

like sail's swath, cloud scud & dawn

horizon's first fiction:
circumference.

On an island surrounded by an ocean, we are far more acutely aware of
circumference and its instances -- the swath cut by a sail at sea, clouds
scudding at the edge of the sky-bowl, and dawn emerging into the frame of
now -- all of which happen on a more apparently 360-degree horizon. The
horizon seems to mark the farthest extent of what we know, so that what
lies beyond is fiction, a doorway to what we don't know, to realities we
will express in language. So, horizons make for stories, language-events,
fictions. But this circumference is also another type of fiction. The
native Hawaiians' reality did not stop at their horizon -- not in their
past, not in the years of colonization, not now. This fiction, however, is
an accepted reality necessary for the work done under the rubric of "the
white man's burden," of colonization. What can an inferior language,
composed of what the missionaries deemed as only the five vowels of
English and seven of its consonants, express that the 26 letters of the
conquering language can say so much better? One of the many ironies in
Featherston's chapbook is that it contains an excess of fourteen letters,
one of which is the "D" whose entry is cited above. Nevertheless, even
within the reality of an alien letter, Hawaii and its first language
adhere. This is readily apparent in the sixth entry, "F is for Fathom":

Every picture book shows a hero
suckled by porpoises.
In "fathom"
swarms of teeth & fins.

In this verse, we begin with the European, colonial view in which primers
introduce young readers to the heroes of its culture, indeed to a culture
(like many) in which heroes, exploration and conquest play a large role.
But the next line introduces what could be a native, folkloric element,
certainly something more likely to be in the realm of island dwellers and
only a story (or fiction) from some place far away to dwellers in European
countries. The result is that "fathom," an English word comprised of t's
and f's not found in the Hawaiian alphabet, is defined not as a linear
measurement of depth, but as "teeth & fins" (t's and f's) native to the
islands, without losing any sense of depth and wonder.

This is only a small example of what Featherston's chapbook treats. As a
ghostwriter myself until recently of business books, I have some inkling
of what it feels to have language stolen from me. What is interesting, as
I continue a project in which I cut up and collage the books I ghostwrote,
is that I can use the imposed language of supplier certification, quality
control and teamwork to decenter itself. In "26 Islands," Featherston
shows just how empowering this can feel.

CHUCK PIERCE PRAGMATIX


He usually get in, when you come in, if me and a white guy called
Cleveland, he knew what he got going already before he got to Cleveland,
like some of the guys don't even come in and take off in Cleveland, they
come in, they drop, they hook up and they gone with a load.  When I come
in I got to come in and go home, then the other guys are gone, you take
what he put down there, he gives you what's left, if a guy is going to
California and you got a Toledo that looks crazy if you got in first
before him, I was about a mile or male behind him because I was loaded
more heavy than he was and we was coming across 80 and I heard him say
shotgun, he went down, he said he is turning around, I think he got me,
you got me there, we were all sitting around talking, I don't know if
they said the same thing, I'm not sure on the date, I didn't finish, I
dropped out in the 11th grade, same as Hart Crane, I went to this spot
labor job, the Standard Sign Company somewhere on East 65th, when you
got to the Standard Sign Company we were unloading aluminum off this
truck and stacking it in piles, and this was all three of you doing that
and during the course of your work, this guy walks up to me and accuses
me of taking his ring, he came up to you and asked you about a ring,
what were the words that were said, "Why did you take my ring."  "I
didn't take it."  "What are you talking about."  We continued working
when you saw him again, what were you doing, I was relaxing, we had
finished the second load of steel and the driver was getting ready to
pull out and I'm smoking a cigarette, looking the other way, at the
truck drivers, sitting down on a pile of this aluminum, what happened
then while I'm looking the other way I hear a scream and look and just
see acid coming at me and that's it, I just jumped and looked behind me
and see him with a bucket jumping and I just jumped up in a lot of pain
just thinking cold water and didn't know where I was in the Plant I ran
out to the street and across the street to find some help in the street
and went into this diner and asked people in there to help me, I said,
"I got acid throwed on me," and the people just sat there and looked at
me on my neck and face I had some in my eyes getting tight on me

What you're calling politics is, as you say, "less visible" as an activity
because it's being funded off the boards, out of public view, by
conservative think-tank money.  We live in an increasingly monadic society,
regardless we may prefer to characterize it as "plural".  Our culture is
god-culture in disguise, excused by a sort of virtual inter-connectedness
that in fact is non-existent (just try talking to those who say this just
ain't so ... ); freedom of choice is mostly at this point just another
eschatological hope, and you know where they've gotten us in the past, the
past itself, of course, being a highly sheltered and perpetually
slaughtering swarm, the human body lately also, an open Roman sewer
certainty, guaranteed by the increasingly tightened "rule of law" much on
the airwaves in recent months.

Tough times ahead's a simplistically broken after-dinner fortune cookie;
questions abt it remain in the present, ie, what to do, how to act / live

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Mark,

I think you point out many interesting and relevant observations about
Jacques Debrot's post the other day, things I noticed myself and conveyed
to him in a backchannel -- we had an interesting correspondence.
Regardless of what I think about the Rhizome essay, I disagree that
Debrot's post plays into this quasi-paranoic (I'm not using this as a
pathological diagnosis but in the funny "Pynchon and the Jesuits behind the
radiator" kind of way) belief in the interconnectivity of all literary
figures who, in Schaefer's term, would be called "celebrity."  You write
that, in the lack of a "major statement... analyzing what these
compromises, blind spots and hypocrisies are," that: "Clearly JD is
throwing in here with SS's 'Perloff cronies seizing power' thing," but I
think this is not accounting for the context of his post, which is that it
is a post -- scrawled rather hastily when the bosses aren't looking -- and
I think Debrot is was quite capable, in this case, in alluding to the
larger argument without necessarily having the provide all the goods.  His
tone in what was probably going to become a "heated" discussion was
extraordinary, and to associate him with a word like "cronies" to JD is a
bit past the mark -- if he wanted to use the word "cronies" he probably
would have.  I was actually more concerned about the line: "The various
stories I've heard about the background of _In the American Tree_ would
surprise a lot of people I think," since, on the one hand, this could have
touched off a few nerves, but on the other, yes, I've heard these stories,
too, but my tendency is to think that these are undocumented, hence merely
"gossip" until someone steps forth to take responsibility for them.  (There
is some content to these stories, as there is content to the decision to
exclude key non-Americans from the anthology, all of which is worth
discussing once the cards are on the table.)  (He also didn't make one very
obvious point, however, which is that Perloff is in no way a "Leftist.")

I also agree that "no one has made anything "unavailable," and that it the
Ashbery approach is a good one (never heard the line myself, but it'll
become part of the personal canon), but I think you missed, as I did
originally, what was said in the final lines of his post:

"The contextual bias of Language Writing -- its overwhelming emphasis on
the role of subjects in the situation of communication seems a very
difficult topic for further aesthetic development (an observation which, I
realize, needs to be qualified to a much greater extent than I have time to
do here).  To the Language Poets this must seem like giving up ground
already fought over and won, but new negotiations & reconsiderations of,
among other things, the place of the emotions in poetry, & the scope &
variety of their presentation seem to me especially timely now."

I know it's impossible to point out at every turn how rushed we often are
in writing these things for the list, but I think Debrot was pretty honest
here in making clear that he realizes that his arguments were being
compromised by time, but also in making a corrective to the earlier
statement that certain poetic elements are "unavailable," which is of
course not something any poet should believe about what "can" or "is to be"
done in their writing.  And the observation about "giving up ground" is
also good, and he's pretty much right, but I would add that (using the
Kuhnian "paradigm" paradigm for a moment, from The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions), that we are probably in a moment of "crisis", in which the
anomalies are coming forth and rendering older paradigms ineffective --
i.e. they can't assimilate it -- which puts all of us in a rush for a "new
language" and until we find it we are heavily oppressed by the old one
(which, in a darkened room, wouldn't be able to find a lit match) and in
such a situation something like "giving up ground" would look very
different to a poet with a different "paradigm."  In other (laughably
reductive) words, poets of the old "paradigm" not only look at the data (in
this case, the poetry, polemics, statements, depressions, anxieties, poor
spelling, senses of "progress") of the new poets with very different
interpretive eyes, but don't even, in some instance, acknowledge this stuff
as "data", but rather as ephemera -- the "lowbrow" -- that will be washed
away once the heavier engines of their own paradigms come back into play.
This is more than saying that the generations are shifting, so-and-so are
crusty and narrow-minded, etc., since if we could just say that nobody
would be nearly as "hysterical" (to quote myself -- again a word I use in a
cartoonshly Freudian sense) as they, sometimes, appear to be.  (Kuhn
attributed suicides and all kinds of strange behavior to paradigm shifts.)
This is interesting in terms of "Left" and "Right" since, for example, I
know a number of poets in the scene here who would be termed by the older
generation as being "reactionary" (not backwards, but quite contemporary,
just "Right"), while to poets of their own ages they are quite clearly
"Left" in their politics even if their poetry is of very different forms
than what the prior poet would consider progressive.  It also interesting
in light of how actions of individuals and the actions of institutions are
often confused in these "hysterical" statements.  I mention Kuhn and
paradigms since I want to try to explain this feeling of ubiquity in terms
of "power control" when related to the Language poets -- in the Kuhnian
scheme, it's not power control so much as paradigm control, these poets
being very much assimilated into a scheme of knowledge that is for the
moment in the ascendant (in our very small circle), and which, quite
involuntarily, renders newer schemes of knowledge impotent by the rejection
of the anomalies they produce _until_ they complete that paradigm shift
which assimilates the anomalies.  Which is to say the sense of rejection
many poets seem to feel by, for example, Charles Bernstein, is partially,
if not completely, the result of the sense of rejection a certain rather
disembodied paradigm creates rather than something a single person could be
said to have affected -- I only mention CB since he is probably one of the
most passionately disliked of poets today and probably has more nonsense
attributed to him than anyone I know, and yet, for those who read him (and
certainly by those who know him), he enjoys, defends, criticizes, and
understands a tremendously wide range of poetry which, in the abstract, he
technically "shouldn't like" (again, why he is often confused with an
"institution" or a system of knowledge, regardless of his obvious reality
as a passionate, flawed, interested, and in my eyes excellent poet).  This
isn't to take the "human element" out of it -- I'm sure CB, for example,
has been ripped (I mean, "pissed" in the English sense) at a few parties
and been less than generous to all ranges of fauna and flora --  but to
point to the justification of terms like "unavailable" in Debrot's post,
since I think many people do believe -- and are justified in believing
because, heck, belief is necessary, usually has it's basis in experience --
that Language poetry rendered many types of writing impossible.  As you
(Mark) point out, in poetry nothing is out of the question, especially if
you can steal -- so why do so many poets feel oppressed by what is a wealth
of material to steal from?  (Note: I'm a shameless klepto.)

Well, longer than I expected.  In any case, I look forward to what Jacques
has to write in the future, and I felt that, finally, his post was quite
suggestive, not to mention diplomatic.

Cheers,
Brian

Subject:      coherent feminist poetics/sentimentalitiy
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I don't dispute for a minute your point that any poetic "tradition" is
often confused and incoherent, that the Romantic/sentimental distinction in
no way accounts for the whole picture of lyric, and that any coherent sense
of a tradition or a poetics depends on ignoring a lot of stuff that doesn't
fit.

That said, I also think such unified senses of tradition are powerful tools
and just because nasty critics and patriarchs have employed them in the
past is no need for feminists who would benefit by them to avoid them.
Shame and fear over reclaiming a lot of women poets who were branded
"sentimental" by modernists and new critics is perhaps one reason that
feminist critics have avoided constructing a coherent feminist poetic
tradition spanning centuries--just as real a reason as postmodern
relativism and a faith in fractured poetics.

So here is the requested elaboration as to why this is useful:
For me to write poetry it helps to have a sense of being rooted in a
continuum--cycles that have repeated, themes that have been meaningful for
centuries (rather than just mostly in the twentieth century). (This is a
personal need I feel no need to defend).  If I can construct- through
exclusion of many things certainly, through maintaining distinctions
certainly (romantic/ sentimental, subject/object and others) which I have
myself, certainly, created in collusion with other poets and critics- an
idea of a continuum of strategies that have a life to them in the sense
that other women poets have used them over centuries, I have discovered
that I often find those strategies more supportive of my heart and mind as
I write than those of other poets. So constructing a coherent feminist
poetics happens to be a helpful strategy for me.  And in order to construct
one I have found it essential to come to terms with the "sentimental."
-Annie


What does it mean to construct a coherent feminist poetics that spans
centuries?  Could you elaborate a little here? A poetics is at a basic
level, strategic -- so for centuries, feminists employ the same strategies?
implying that they have the same goal?  Coherent implies either 'it all
sticks together/agrees' or it's all lucid, as opposed to being oppositional
(even from within -- Woolf opposing feminist strategies) or at times
confused or incoherent.  I'm not sure why such a construction is so useful.
It seems very exclusive. The idea that there _is_ an 'outside world,' to
pick on one point in your definition, would seem to exclude all sorts of
lyrics that don't erect that hurdle.  I mean, what's the world 'outside' of?
The poem? Language? Experience?  And in distinguishing between the Romantic
and Sentimental, what of the stuff that doesn't fit?  Is it Other, i.e. not
lyric?  Maybe an unfair question, but, more accurately, why locate *this
particular* distinction? (This obviously relates to its value to
constructing a coherent feminist poetics).

Even four years after the Blaser conference, people ask about that big
charmer from San Francisco, Kevin Killian, even the empty heads who'd
shudder if they recalled his audacious presentation comparing Blaser and
Hitchcock, speaking of the contemporaneous compositions, Cups and The
Birds. Killian says:

I read The Holy Forest as a fantasia of dismemberment, cannibalism, violent
expulsion, excretion, death and desire--Roman Catholic themes, the themes
of Kristeva is her "essay in abjection' Powers of Horror, and of course the
themes of Hitchcock's late phase. "A split seems to have set in between, on
the one hand, the body's territory where an authority without guilt
prevails, a kind of fusion between mother and nature, and on the other
hand, a totally different universe of socially signifying performances
where embarassment, shame, guilt, desire, etc., come into play--the order
of the phallus."Blaser's birds are not only helpless victims; they're also
murderous birds of prey. Even their shit can kill, as the narrating subject
of "the Park" relates:

               Jessie Whitehad told me they sometimes choose a tree
               and kill it, they so mire the branches

Kevin and George Stanley and Bruce Boone all talk about the homosexual
milieu in San Francisco when Blaser and Spicer and Duncan were great
companions devouring each other.  George, another of the neglected giants
of American Poetry(anybody teaching Gentle Northern Summer?) in his
talk/reading even apologizes for his early viciousness. I'd love to
reproduce the entire poem he read Phaedrus but i'll just tease you with two
sections of  the nine part poem and let you come upon the full pleasure
through your own research

                       Dublin-Sligo

In the dawn I see the horse paths of the gods.
Men make the day
or slip into th'abyss of thought. In the morning
moving uncertainly, uncertainly, I let
feeling awake, it awakes
between two surfaces
between night and morning,
between lips and skin
and a great brown horse
runs across the field
toward the event
of which we are the moving

& the sunlight on the sheets was like silver flowers

              The Words

of a poem are a roundabout way of saying nothing.
The thousand different bird-songs, the thousand flowers
contradict this--they say
Everything is not subsumed(despite Hegel--and Hegel did
       not say this either of course, Hegel is with the
       flowers) the naming
must go on--that is the Way

Tree whose leaves look like a maple
wild mustard, magenta star.

And here we are. Have we one soul or many?
The sheep, have they
one soul?

Fingers on a keyboard
of sticks and stones.
Some stick and some don't.


and Bruce Boone, in his talk "Eros and Poesis," Introduction starts off by
saying:

I was talking to Nate Mackey, just before coming in here, about the
possibility of discussions.  And we both remarked on the lack of audience
participation and discussion afterwards. And I was trying to accout for
that in my own mind, and I thought that a lot of it was related to a level
of abstraction, which was partly and legitimately due to a large
L-A-N-G-U-A-G-E poet influence.

and then later in the meat of his talk:

All the femm folderol, the high homo, especially in the early Robin,
associated with the image movement stuff, you know, the Cups, the elegance,
the enumeration of precious objects, the poses, and stuff like
that....That's a big part of the reading of Robin I think that needs to be
further done. And I'm much more interested in the femme stuff than the
actual sex mentions, which are more than i had remembered when i looked
through them. The mentionings of sexual couplings are, they are sometimes
somewhat discreet, sometimes not. But I think that that kind of queen
stuff, not to put too fine a point on it, is more important than the sex
stuff in the presentation of Eros.

So much for this morning's installment of quick takes and impressions of
the high quality of this Talon books production, The Recovery of the Public
World, Essays on Poetics in Honour of Robin Blaser edited by Charles Watts
and Edward Byrne. tata amis.

So there I was, staggering off the plane from Copenhagen and wondering
how I could keep myself awake for another seven hours to de-jetlag, when
I saw the solution gleaming on top of a heap of utility bills and
pre-approved credit offers -- the new issue of the Brit experimental
magazine Angel Exhaust.  If you don't read this, you'll probably hate
yourself forever.

This issue is called Suitear Na n-AINGEAL, which I assume is Gaelic for
Angel Exhaust, since the issue is devoted to Irish experimental poetry.
There's a good selection of poetry by Randolph Healy, Catherine Walsh,
Billy Mills, Sean Carey, Judy Kravis and David Lloyd, and essays on
several generations of Irish experimentalists, from the thirties to the
present.

From the introduction by John Goodby, who really knows his stuff:

"[The Irish experimental] poets differ from each other in a fascinating
non-tradition, an uncluttered breathing space; their poetry is
considered, clear and refreshingly free of stridency, hugger-mugger
modishness, empty tricks or posturing.  It interconnects, but in
generally non-cliquish and unaggressive ways that poets in other
countries might learn from.  The provisional, fluid quality of Coffey's
poetry flows through Walsh and Squires, but they owe at least as much to
Clarke and Olson; likewise, Mills, Healy and Joyce and interested in
scientific and non-poetic disourses, but their poetry is utterly
dissimilar; Scully...is yet "another pair of sleeves" to use Beckett's
reference to his own poetry, [Scully is] perhaps the first Irish poet to
approach ... the incendiary quality of the avant-garde."

Check it out, I implore you.  35 Stewarts Way, Maunden, nr. Bishop's
Stortford, Herts., CM23 1DR, UK.

Also http://angel-exhaust.offworld.co.uk

And by the way, just underneath the magazine was another package, from
Coach House Press in Canada -- the long awaited collaborative
novel/memoir Piccolo Mondo by George & Angela Bowering, Michael Matthews
and David Bromige.  Can't wait to pop it open and plumb the depths of
Tish-era Vancouver.

Considering emotion is currently out of fashion; to oppose one section
would lead to acknowledgement of import of the second.  Separatist acts
lead to a double sign whose connotive signifies power. A signifier-fied
relation, Kristeva-n poles of duplicity, a named thing in opposing
forces. "One moves in circles about oneself because one has no other in
which to reason, let alone be." Thilleman. Corruption is ahead of us.
Beyond "words and artifice in lines; hence corruption." The motion in
emotion has force albeit difficult in page transcendence. Save us from
fashion's bowdlerized statement. Abandon such truck and giving of levity
to such garbage.

Poetry needs a schtick; an igneous renaissance. Yes, stone. Einstein.
One-stone. The clean, clear thing, an impossibility through medium
flaws. Corruption creates the trend of sphericity  of humans, the
withering, the curling up and active avoidance of one to another.
Circumnavigation through words of a person in survival, that is, a
sphere, says little. What else are our optives?

The contaminant is the sheet. Can any of us avoid it's latent
connotative value? By connotative I am thinking of Saul Kripke's notion
of a fixed reference, the way when we "identified light we fixed a
reference." Use of the sheet to print brings all of it's values to
cascade upon the poem. The prevalence of the sheet as a a locus of
invested capital to cover remaining free space for the eye and cajole
it's viewers to sphericity. To a clos-edness. Rock, scissors,
paper-mache paste squares. Reguardless of the poem's contained material,
the influx of the notion of sheet will still taint the media of the
poetry. Two issues next to each other in same size, width and height,
repel the reader to superfluous choices based upon colors and adroit
text reads. Journals are the sea; literature flows into it at will.
While there are other options, Web journals, hand printing and so on,
each's connotations are ignored or rarely explored.

Perhaps I missed something but the loss of the scientific realm has been
under-discussed yet one a number of folks have been attempting
reclaimation of. So why this failure, why not re-negotiate terms of
poetic science? That is, poetry as science, as an interpenetrated
possibility to solve the real.

Something has changed. Form _and_ function are never more than the
extension of content. If we end the lyric through believing Beauty is
within the spiral of the words projected upon the real and therefore
rejected personifications are unnecessary, then where are we currently?
A pie-tasting contest where lack of pie, the object, squared or
otherwise, then becomes the modus operandi of the poem, so to speak.

Be well

towards poetry as the science of emotion.

I have been reading some of the articles in a Russian anthology of
visual poetry and finding there references to poetry (art) as an
investigation (science, experiment) of feeling>  This has caused me to
go back in my reading to futurism (back to the future?), lettrism, annd
other abandoned paths (Yes, Henry even acmeism), where the same idea
arises.  Is this something that was loat sight of in the "scientific"
west of mid-century, followed by langpo which may or may not have
neglected emotion?

In this queer world as everyone knows

Is it because of your desires that you say in this queer world as
everyone knows?

Some are living in beautiful mansions

Maybe and now I adjust my panties - your life has to do with some
girl related to this.

And are wearing the finest of clothes

What makes you yearn and cry that and are wearing the finest of
clothes?

There are blue blooded queens and princesses

Is it because of the boys you hang around with that you say there are
blue blooded queens and princesses?

Who have charms made of diamonds and pearl

Is it because of your nakedness that you are going through all this?

But the only and thoroughbred lady is the Rebel Girl

Is it because the only and thoroughbred lady is the rebel girl that
you came naked and broken to me?

That's the Rebel Girl, That's the Rebel Girl

What makes you believe that's the rebel girl that's the rebel girl?

To the working class she's a precious pearl

Earlier you said the only and thoroughbred lady is the rebel girl?

She brings courage pride and joy to the fighting Rebel Boy

How do you reconcile any fantasies you have of me?

We've had girls before but we need some more

Does it bother you that you need some more?

In the Industrial Workers of the World

Is it because of your sex life that you say in the industrial workers
of the world?

For it's great to fight for freedom with a Rebel Girl

You mentioned that the only and thoroughbred lady is the rebel girl?

Yes, her hands may be hardened from labor

Could be this is some girl the reason for perversions you have?

And her dress may not be very fine

Are you sure that and her dress may not be very fine?

But a heart in her bosom is beating

When did you first know that a heart in her bosom is beating?

That is true to her class and her kind

Is the fact that is true to her class and her kind the real reason?

And the grafters in terror are trembling

Do you really think you need some more?

When her spite and defiance she'll hurl

What happened when she spite and defiance she'll hurl?

For the only and thoroughbred lady is the Rebel Girl

Perhaps and now I exhibit my frocks - your inhibitions are related to
this.

That's the Rebel Girl, That's the Rebel Girl

Is it because of some problems in my childhood that you say that's the
rebel girl that's the rebel girl?

To the working class she's a precious pearl

Earlier you said the only and thoroughbred lady is the rebel girl?

She brings courage pride and joy to the fighting Rebel Boy

Is it because of some problems at home that you are going through all
this?

We've had girls before but we need some more

You mentioned that a heart in her bosom is beating?

p.s. i managed to avoid the word "backchannel."  this is

Mark Prejsnar here:

I'd like to thank Brian Stefans for his excellent and generous discussion
of what i said about Jacques Debrot, and ultimately S. Schaefer....

I've lived with a scientist (who also theorizes on the philosophy of
science) for 18 years or so, often helping with her work.... And i have no
problem in broad outline with your use of Kuhn.  My biggest objection here
is that when you get down to concrete details, the gaps between different
generations and different tendencies in poetry *cannot* be precisely
likened to paradigm shifts in the sciences.  The whole point of Kuhn's
idea, is that one paradigm pretty much rools OK?  at a given time, in a
given science.  I hope (and intend, if i have anything to do with it!) that
one general frame will never dominate good poetry writing.  Poetry isn't
about proving that one single approach is "right"!

And in fact the boiling up of good poetry after 1973 in the US didn't that
much try to force a single frame onto contemporary poetry... Those
poet/theorists tended to a fairly wild and anarchic array of *different*
emphases and theories... This is one reason so many people have dismissed
Standard's tirade (and, on a different but related note, why i've been
somewhat whimsically urging people to stop using the "L phrase" altogether)

But if you were gonna proceed with this argument, i feel you'd need to
flesh it out with details:  all models of the history of the sciences, that
posit a paradigm shift, go into some detail about the exact differences
that distinguish competing paradigms.

There are a million ways to approach this, but just for instance:  i have
been reading Martine Bellen's Tales of Murasaki, a Sun and Moon book of
poems, and Cole Swenson's Try (published by the University of Iowa Press!
speaking of the complexities of tendencies...)  Now how might your argument
work vis-a-vis those two books i wonder?  Is Swenson the "older" paradigm
(L-po) and Bellen the new??  Are both the old?  Don't know much about
either poet, but to me CS is the more established and widely published one,
so i found myself assuming she wd. represent the "older" paradigm as you
put it.  But maybe Bellen's work has just slipped past my radar till now.
In fact on the whole there is more connected syntax in Try and more
unexpected and extreme verbal disjunction in Bellen's Murasaki.  In any
event they seem to me to be both recognizably: work published in the last 5
years of the 20th century, in the US.  They (like so much contemporary
work) do not strike me as representing paradigms, but interesting writing
by amazingly gifted and virtuosic poets... What seperates 'em seems to have
more to do with choices made by Bellen and Swenson, than with any
generalizable tendency...

What you quote regarding "contextual bias" is indeed interesting and
intelligent.  What i've said above is pertinent:  if i understand what
Jacques means by the passage you quote, i would agree but also suggest that
the poets of the 70s and 80s are *so different* so much of the time, that
to suggest that their lean toward awareness of the "subject in
communication" is a grave flaw, has to appear close to nit-picking.  Over
and over, i wonder if i'm just too amiable, or (as i actually believe of
course) if it isn't the case that even pretty balanced and friendly
commentators feel a need to belittle others (grouping 'em questionably
together with that L phrase) because they just don't feel there will be
enuff room for themselves, otherwise, somehow!

Hell, i can't help feeling that the more people appreciate the best writing
of my time, Coolidge say, or Hejinian, or Andrews, the more chance i have
of being judged well and in a balanced way, and not thru conservative or
ill-informed or screwed-up filters...

Hope i wasn't too harsh in response to Jacques (as seems to be implied in a
few places in your post); that wasn't the feel i wanted to convey at all,
and i also think that the things he's said on these topics are excellent
and much appreciated.

Her


Last night, I couldn't sleep, violent insomnia, dismemberings.
I heard voices over and over again coming towards me, devouring me.
My ears were consumed in the fire of frantic voices.
Voices wouldn't let me sleep in peace, these voices.
I heard a vast and noisy blanket descend over the bed full of voices.
Voices whispered to me of dark things I could not comprehend.
Voices whispered to me of things I understood in unknown languages.
Screams in hebrew and aramaic - loud voices in akkadian and mitannian.
My tongue was consumed in a fire of futile replying; I had no voice.
Voiceless, my vocal cords no longer murmured, my throat gouged out.
In loving reply, I screamed, voiceless, back into the whirlwind.
The Book of Judges screamed in reply: Judges 19, 20, 21:

Why did the host offer to throw his virgin daughter out to the Benjamin
men? Why does the concubine, _pilegesh,_ remain unnamed? Why was she
thrown out to them? Why was Israel mapped in that long journey on her body
the unknown man crisscrossing the country - her corpse split among the
tribes, the violent war which followed? Who were these people; why do they
disappear from the ensuing fray? Why was she repeatedly raped? Why did the
concubine return initially to Bethlehem? Why did the war result in further
rape and pillaging? What drove these men out of their huts in such a fash-
ion? Why is this tale of men spelled out in carnage - why is no one named?
Later the ark's carried uselessly back and forth over the land of the
Philistines - bringing hemorrhoids and mice - later returned - hemorr-
hoids and mice cast in gold. Why this eternal distribution? But who was
the concubine? Why does it say earlier she played the harlot? (Against him
or on him, then to her father's house - he follows, brings her back after
assuagement, entertainment - a delay like that before brutal orgasm - then
they stop at the fatal house in Bethlehem - what became an inn of violence
and despair - what began in grace and kindness. Think of the night, it's
night there in the town, there are rough men about, this host takes the
party in, there's banging out the door. Flickering lanterns. There are
loud voices, drunken voices, demanding the man - they're going to fuck
him. The host offers the daughter instead, as well as the concubine. The
text seems slightly contrary here. The men wouldn't listen to him so they
took the concubine, raped her all night long. She was dead on the door-
step; the man came out and took her with him. What did he say to the host?
The host had taken them in? The man distributed the body among the tribes;
they'd never seen anything like that, not since they came out of the land
of Egypt. There had to be war. The other tribes prevailed over Benjamin;
it took a while. Benjamin himself had been a favorite son - later there's
Samuel anointing Saul - from Benjamin again. I hear the voices outside the
host's house which has become an inn; the man and his concubine and asses
are staying gratis. The host is hold; he's kind, helpful. The rest of the
folk wouldn't have anything to do with the visitors - they weren't helpful
at all. It's the night before; they're all speaking happily. The pilegesh
doesn't know she's about to die, then dismembered, cast among the tribes.
There's the sound of men outside - they're drunken, surly, out of control.
Surely they were out of control. Speaking the language of the Bible,
mouthing it - the language which would later hold them in abeyance, name-
less as well. All these characters will disappear into the fray. Later,
millennia later, I'll be sleeping; voices will violate my body, strange
mouths will appear breaking through my skin. There are screams and taunts
from all of them - only my original mouth, taken over by the concubine -
moaning and fearful - knowing now what's coming - it's all written down -
I'll call her Shekinah -

Subject:      define "institution"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

first want to thank Marcella Durand belatedly for some much
needed clarification re St. Marks and more particularly her
talk at Barnard Conference (re 4/23/99 Poetics List post "Barnard
Report").  My hastily scribbled notes thank you too.

Marcella raises the q. which seems at the heart of the recent thread re
Power & Language Poetry (reflecting now on Presjnar's response to
Debrot re Schaefer's RHIZOME essay) -- poets relations to "institutions"
(and thus to Power?), especially in discerning whether or not individuals
*have* power.  Our dialogue was not abt. whether individuals have power,
but what be the function of space-maintaining institutions, but I see in
putting
these two issues side by side a fruitful bleeding, as in colors that bleed,
if
anyone out there would like to draw some blood.  I don't mean it do sound
as violent as all that!  just colorful.

Anyway, I objected to their (the St. Marks' panelists) reference to the
Poetry Project as a "non-institutional institution" simply because that
didn't make sense, seemed Lacanian semanticism ("she doesn't lack,
she lacks lack, etc.).  The gist of the issue I raised was how do
"dialogues"
that occurs in a physical/social space get into print, by what means
does a dialogue continue so as to be an "extension" or "report" of
what happened in that space?  I questioned whether the Poetry Project
Newletter, fine as it is, didn't serve more of an "institutional" function
(that of maintaining the institution) than a "poetic" function (i.e. that of
continuing the dialogues that occur in that space).

Marcella responded:
>But yes, one of the intrinsic problems of being a "space," especially a
>social space, is that others will inevitably feel excluded, at least
>physically or geographically, from that space. Which is why the Project
>is interested in website and e-mail potentials as a way of overcoming
>that obstacle, as well as the "regional updates" section of the
>Newsletter. It is somewhat of an "office policy" to try and continue a
>poetic dialogue beyond spatial limitations. I think this issue also plays
>into being a non-institutional institution. What is perceived as
>"institutional"? At what point does an organization, a social scene, a
>dialogue, become institutionalized?


Likewise, what is it to be a "non-institutional institution"?  I am by no
means
attacking St. Mark's & the many fine poets and goings-on associated with
it/them, and the website & newsletter which do a great job of continuing
"beyond
spatial limitations."  I'm interested in spatial limitiations and of course
the desire
to transcend them. And thus interested in how poetic dialogues carry on,
shift, or
continue outside of the physical spaces in which they occur; lost in
translation as
they say?  We all know what makes meeting possible, whether by sharing
one's space/time/money or by securing the funding (getting a "share" of
someone
else's space/time/money) -- but how can poets "keep them" from becoming
"institutional"  -- and is that what's at stake? Is it *bad* to be
institutional (in this
day and age? or a necessary evil?) And isn't avoiding institutionalizing
then
battling the canonizing 'tendancy' of literary history, which constructs
movements,
lineages, coherencies where there were before people making poems?

Like Marcella, I'm interested in when an organization (or a person!)
*becomes*
an institution.  Perhaps an interest somewhat disinterested: a taxonomic
desire (that is, if taxonomy = a system of classification and taxonomic =
tending
toward such a system) that hopes to extend beyond that grand taxonomy
canonization and see what gets left out why.  I'd say if it strives toward
long-term
self-maintenance and deals  with money (especially in such amounts that an
'administration' comes into existence) then its an institution.
Organizations
on the other hand crop up when a certain issue arises, and run mostly on the
energy of people involved.  There's a casualness about them no matter how
serious they in fact are. A reading series, as much as it is organized, is
an
organization.  A little magazine too, and a small press, though these seem
to
commence striving a bit more toward permanence than did, say, mimeo
revolution publications (i.e. by soliciting subscribers and seeking
non-profit
status -- though this again may be a *necessary evil* not necessarily evil,
a
sign of the times).  They might rely on an institution (the NEA or SCA, say)
but don't strive to be like one.  Organizations have push, institutions
*have* power.

Arrgh.  The Angel Exhaust link I mentioned seems to be down.  I recall

British experimental poetry, some back issues are up at the URL below,

    And I'm defrosting today. Laundry stranded in the mat (above which
    rohrer lives, just as jarnot used to live above "under the pig"
    across from the luna lounge on ludlow where luoma used to go for
    laffs). It's raining love, the radio sounds so burlington today
    so thinking about the past that was a hope of art not sucking
    until drunk. but not those "reading reports" but the particular
    way i realize that almost everybody i know i somehow met "through
    poetry" or "the scene" which would seem distinct from poetry if
    it were less humid thunder to bike sideways o'er the brooklyn bridge
    for its birthday just like the white wing (fuschia) dove at the
    one's who stand so frown (for you know we couldn't stay black
    against the night). Still no sound of ice falling from the roof
    of the freezer's mouth....

    Anyway, I do love the poetry scene when it leads to things outside
    itself. So, I went to that Bar 13 last night again (for those in,
    or planning to visit NYC, if you're at all interested in going out
    at MIDNIGHT ON A SUNDAY To dance to 60s (sixties) music, and watch
    people in their early 20s sometimes in "60s costumes", please contact
    me---I'm always looking for people to go with, not liking to "go it
    alone" as it were.

    I discovered this place, because John Arizza and Greg Fuchs and Brett
    Evans and others had a reading there once or twice, but I didn't
    know it featured 60s dancing until I happened to be coming back
    from this birthday party for some woman (who I kinda met through
    louma), whose father runs the hair-club for men, and we were looking
    for somewhere to go, and walked in and they were playing TOMORROW
    NEVER KNOWS and I was hooked, and even bill luoma decided to stay
    and dance (96 tears or incense and peppermint)---and I've gone
    many times since, last night with Jody, a great DJ (I'm trying to
    set him up with the FENCE people for some dance party) who people
    say looks like me (though he's taller, thinner, and more african),
    and it was really crowded, and we got there too late to get the
    tambourines they were handing out, but not too late to him them
    play THE RAPPER by the JAGGERZ, then seque into 25 MILES by Edwin
    Starr, and then SOUL FINGER by the BAR-KAYS (just before they died in
    that otis redding rush crash), and why were they handing out
    tambourines, not perhaps because it was dylan's birthday eve, but
    because it was the second anniversay of the opening of 60s night at
    this place (and I got thinking, it was EXACTLY TWO YEARS AGO that
    I (and louma, etc.) happened upon this place, and so i mark an
    anniversary too...(and defrosting is slow, but the rain continues....)

    c
   P.S. DOES ANYBODY HAVE A TAPE OF SUN RA ARKESTRA ANN ARBOR 1973 concert?

   we'll meet on edges soon,

Hello, it's wendy kramer. at the risk of stating/noticing what may be
the obvious to people, can someone fill me in on ray johnson & hannah
weiner's acquaintance?

    i was leafing through some photocopies of new york correspondance
school stuff / ray johnson stuff  & there was a sheet of the semaphore
flag symbols.  and so of course i thot of hannah weiner's code poems
and as i was flipping through some more  and thinking how the
correspondance school meeting notes  from ray johnson were sounding a
little like gertrude stein (& thot of his collage portrait of stein) and
then sounded quite a lot like hannah weiner's typing in clairvoyant
journal; then, flipping through some more, lo and behold there was a new
york correspondance school meeting seating chart with hannah weiner's
name in one of the spots bottom row smack in the middle.

    So, does anyone know anything about them knowing each other? the
performance dates for code poems mentioned in the book are roughly
contemporary with the stuff i was looking at.

    as a final note, there was also in this ray johnson stuff a sheet of
moticos symbols-- remember  the filled in  black  figures derived from
(as i remember from the whitney exhibit) the outlines of his moticos
collages. and again, they have an affinity with the illustrations of
semaphores and other code in code poems. the semaphore figures the
sailor holding for with flags  in various motico-like postures.  !!

    please backchannel   or front   if there's interest.
thanks

anybody doing anything about this war we're having?
or this capitalism we're hoovering?
or this atomization of the intelligence we're endrunning by singing along
with creative studies?


Isn't political efficacy something poetry goes alongside of, is inspired

I'm interested in poems that were "found" inside of other texts (such as
Cage's mesostics and Reznikoff's _Testimony_). What are some favorites in
this genre by others? Any critical texts about these kinds of procedures I
should know about?

the lifelong master of found poetry is the venerable Bern Porter--The
Book of Do, The Book of Dont, CRCNCL, The Manhattan Phonebook, Found
Poems, The Waste-makers.  Most of his published work since 55 or so has
incorporated every manner of found experimentation.

As this is a wonderful question deserving attention, I'll try to post
those titles I know of, which might be numerous, & then what separates
found texts from plagiarized texts?

Last Friday, Susan Howe and Dominique Fourcade read (Bernstein read the
translations) at the Dia foundation. Dia foundation has six or so huge
skylights, and as Dominique sweetly read his poems about days made out of
snow, and other French things, the light in the room changed from daylight
to
night. Charles with his perfect French accent (ha ha) gave a loud twang to
the
translations, and the odd mixture of the two voices made the audience still
as
statues. It was a wash of Frenchness and sincerity, a bit comatose, yet
meditative. Then Susan came on, and did her slide show of _Pierce-Arrow_
(recently published by New Directions)--and WOW! She started with page xii
of
the book, a Pierce ms with 22 different variations on the phrase "Somebody
praises somebody to his face." It was very humorous and Steinian,
particularly
the way she read it. Then she moved into Pierce's doodles, and his very
strange calculations of ones and zeros that were stacked like stairs across
the pages (a bizarre binary language, way before its time). Susan read
mostly
the parts of the book about Pierce's life, but then gradually moved into her
poems. She talked in her intro about how she is beginning to see more and
more
of a connection between poetry and non-symbolic logic, and as she moved
further and further into her poems, her slides of the Pierce manuscripts got
more and more non-symbolic. It was like cognitive mapping off the
map and into an undiscovered intellectual and emotional terrain that was
really quite moving.

Jena Osman had in mind, I'm guessing, texts produced through unvarying
procedures.

But some recent & non-procedural examples of "writing through" found texts
that I've enjoyed particulalry are Douglas Messerli's AFTER, Guy Bennet's
LAST WORDS, & Aaron Shurin's INTO DISTANCES.  Sections of Sianne Ngai's
recent book, CRITERIA, also do very interesting things with found texts.

Class, Gender and Innovative Poetics

Robin Tremblay-McGaw here.  I want to announce that Kathy Lou Schultz
and I will be editing the next issue of HOW2's Forum on Class and
Poetics.  See below for the call for work.


Thanks to the efforts of feminist poets, critics, and editors, it is now

possible to identify a discourse--both scholarly and creative--of gender

and poetics. In the 1980s, journals such as HOW(ever) put the spotlight
on these issues, particularly related to innovative or experimental
practices, thereby providing a forum for the exploration of a vocabulary
for
talking about gender and poetics.  Today we find ourselves trying to
create a
vocabulary for addressing the complex issues of class, gender, and
innovative poetics.  As Kathy Lou Schultz asked in her Tripwire essay,
"What's a working class poetic, and where could I find one?"  Or we
could ask, what are the (lipstick) traces of class?  How do we make
present
the absence of class in discussions about gender and poetics?  What are
the
intersections of race in discussions of class? How are these things
fused and CON-fused?  How do/can we picture/trace working class issues
in
formally innovative ways?  What do the circumstances of literary
production surrounding writers themselves--and the writing
produced--have to do
with one another, with innovation, and with gender?

Email submissions should be sent to: robinandkathy@tf.org as a text file
included in the body of the email message.

Jena,

A few texts spring most readily to mind here:

Jackson Mac Low's _Words nd Ends from Ez_, _Virginia Woolf Poems_,
_Barnesbook_, etc.
Ronald Johnson's _Radi Os_ (1st 4[?] books of Paradise Lost, written-through
by subtraction)
Hannah Weiner's _Weeks_ (I don't think it sticks very "purely" to language
heard on the news, but most of it's close)
Tom Phillips' _A Humument_
Joan Retallack's _Errata 5uite_ (Are you looking for poems "found" in single
texts, or collaged from a number of sources?)
David Bromige's Sonoma County newspaper prose poem, a lovely piece whose
title I'm unfortunately not able to recall

I also remember well a piece by Rosmarie and Keith Waldrop, read by them at
the Ear Inn back in '95(?), which was created by successively working
through Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey," each time subtracting a certain
proportion of words. Rosmarie's use of Wittgenstein in _The Reproduction of
Profiles_ and _Lawn of Excluded Middle_, while not a pure example of the
genre, also might be of interest.

In the realm of badly-remembered secondhand information, didn't I also hear
somewhere that dictionary definitions had some role as "source material" in
Clark Coolidge's _The Maintains_?

Analogies in music too numerous to document here - and probably off-topic,
though I'd be happy to backchannel if you're interested. One I'll mention,
since it connects to one of your examples, is Cage's _Quartets I-VIII_,
which is a subtractive rewriting of American Protestant hymns.

I'm drawing a blank when trying to think of critical prose on this specific
topic other than that by the poets/composers themselves, though there are a
number of texts which might be extended to apply here by analogy. Which
leaves Mac Low's and Cage's "explanatory" prose glosses, along with Cage's
_Diary_ [_Journal_?] as good introductions to the procedures, some of the
aesthetic and political claims that have been made for them, etc.

I hope this is at least a little helpful.


Taylor

Dear friend, I have just read, my dear friend [the words
"my dear friend" were written by Lenin in English--Ed.]
I have just read the telegram, and changed the envelope
marked for "A" [The letter has never been found.--Ed.]
I also want to correspond.  Let's continue to correspond.
The precedent letter was sent in too much hurry.  Proof:
There were three electors from Warsaw for the worker curia.
 Comedians!  They can repeat it.  They know it by heart.
    Today a meeting of the Lefts here:  everyone came,
2 Swiss + 2 foreigners (Germans) + 3 Russ. Jew.  Polish.
Schwach!  There it is, my fate.  I think it will be almost
a failure.  [The lecture did not come off, only a talk.--Ed.]
Now there is Radek.  We (Zinoviev and I) recognized Bukharin.
The article by Nota Bene No. 6 of Jugend-Internationale
have you seen it?  I replied to his stupidities in No. 2.
You haven't seen it?  It was already a few days ago.
    How I laughed at your postcard, I really had to hold
my sides, "In France there is no such measure as the ha,
but there is the acre, and you don't know how big an acre
is . . . "  Ha ha ha!  It was France--imaginez vous?--that
introduce the metric system.  A ha = hectare = 100 ares.
An acre is not a French measure but an English one.
It really is funny that you do not often come across the words
hectare, ha, etc.  They are dull, technical words

Untangling Speech

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By HENRY FOUNTAIN
Back in the 1960's, fans of the Beatles spent hours playing their albums
backward, destroying many a phonograph needle in an effort to decipher
messages supposedly recorded in reverse concerning Paul McCartney's fate.

New research shows, however, that backward speech does not have to be
unintelligible. Much as the brain can fill in missing words in a
half-heard sentence at a noisy cocktail party, it can also make sense of
reversed speech. If the Beatles had recorded "Paul is dead" in a certain
way, all those needles might have been saved.

In the new study, reported in a recent issue of Nature, scientists at the
California Institute of Technology and California State University at Los
Angeles took a recorded sentence, broke it into equal short segments, and
reversed each segment. They strung all the reversed segments together and
played the sentence to listeners.

When the segments were about 50 milliseconds in length, the sentence was
perfectly intelligible. As segments got longer, however, intelligibility
declined, approaching zero when they reached 200 milliseconds.

The research lends support to recent theories of how speech is perceived.
These theories hold that the brain does not rely so much on analyzing the
spectrum of short-term sounds as it does on lower-frequency cues like
intonation and modulation. As long as the segments were short enough, the
brain was still able to decipher these cues.

the following is from a post by Pat Sloane one the t.s.e. list.  since it
could be of interest to many on this list, I thought I would pass it along.

joe brennan


In a message dated 5/26/99 11:21:44 AM Eastern Daylight Time,
Patsloane@aol.com writes:


I don't want to center on Muse, because there are about a dozen companies
selling their $3600 or $4500 subscription to Universities.  They're trying to
establish a monopoly on information that used to be available for free.  They
think they're going to force every single university library to subscribe,
which isn't going to happen because libraries are getting their budgets cut
left and right and many couldn't have afforded those kinds of fees in the
first place.  People getting caught in the middle are independent
scholars--of whom we now have an enormous number--faculty and students at
colleges that don't subscribe or can't afford to subscribe, and anyone who
prefers to work at home...as many people do. Even today, there are plenty of
colleges still using 286 and 386 computers.

I call it the new censorship. There's a bill before Congress right now giving
database owners rights to the material in their database. This means if you
want to quote from an article in a journal that's affiliated with Muse,
you'll need permission from Muse, and judging from how all of these vendors
are skinning universities alive on their subscription fees, the cost of
permission  won't be inconsequential.  This biggest problem is going to be
with medical journals, because not every doctor is affiliated with a
university, or a university that subscribes to everything.  Lawyers have had
Westlaw for some time, and they're used to paying big fees which they can
pass on to clients. Westlaw, at least, has individual subscriptions.  If you
know anything about the history of monopolistic practices in any field,
you'll recognize what you're seeing.  Corner the market and you can charge
what you want.  I think it's important for anyone publishing to retain the
copyright in his or her own name, because we can't count on the courtesies of
the past.

The one counter-force I notice is the many electronic journals that are
available to anyone, and are free. I don't think many academics expect to
make money off of journal articles. But you at least hope they'll be seen so
that when you do a book people will know who you are.  I'm against anything
that cuts down the number of people who can see the material.  And of course
this is not anything Richard can do anything about. We're all caught up in
something evil.

Same thing happened long ago with publishers, and this is why publishers
aren't doing the kind of job they did years ago.  It used to be that a
publisher was satisfied to make a decent profit overall, and they printed
some books that they thought were worthwhile but probably not big money
makers, and it all averaged out. Now, with some many publishers owned by
Time-Warner and similar conglomerates, a decent profit isn't enough. Now
they're all gunning for an  enormous profit, which is why the balance is
tipping towards tell-all books by celebrities.  Read the stock market page to
see where our lives are--every company has to assure "investors" that they'll
make more money this year than last year.  Whether the company is making a
decent product, or a product they can be proud of, gets much less attention.

Don't you find it interesting that we, as a species, (like it or not) have
but three options: war, famine, or pandemic?  These types of queries - is
anybody going to do anything, this act of DOING in response to one of the
three inevitable options mentioned above - are missing a core beat.  We ARE
doing.  We are in a momentum, a spiral toward extinction.

The harder question to ask our fellow species is this: is anyone doing
anything about overpopulation and the global pandemic we - as
anthropocentrists - refer to as humanity?  The answer can be found partially
in Yugoslavia.  Controlled warfare - where many lives are lost in a select
area - is a better option than famine (which we can expect to emerge out of
The Middle East and China and other far-too-populated locations) and the
random sweeping of disease (which does not obey borders, ethnicities, etc.)

The ecology is tilted, and it is lost.  What to do.  What to do.  Wear a
condom and forget god.  There's a start.

>
>3. Bush attorney Benjamin Ginsberg sends Exley a cease-and-desist letter,

>
>4. The Bush campaign tells press interested in the above situation that

        My favorite such book is Ronald Johnson's RADI  OS  made out of
Milton's Paradise Lost.
        Working with found materials has become an honored tradition in
20th century art:  in painting, film, poetry, prose and music and dance.
        Following a dictum of Henry Miller's in the "14th Ward" section of
BLACK SPRING  ("What is not in the open street is false, derived, that is
to say, literature.") I make poems and visual poems out of materials found
on street.  Most recently make works by rubbing with charcoal on to paper
worrds and words made out of the existing letters only, found on trash
containers, autos, sewer covers, police cll boxes, hydrants,
buildings--anything that is raised and can be rubbed on to paper.  Using a
finite set of given letters is challenging and many strange messages
emerge.  Not to mention n can practice Situationist detournement of
original messages.
        Found materials abound.
        My only caution:  watch out for the police! Not always too
friendly to those who make "ST WORKS"!
        Also many found objects, papers, etc etc may be used as stencils
or stamps when wetted with spray paint.
        Or make transfers from newspapers using lighter fluid.
        The dictionary a page at a time is a good source for work.
        Burroughs' and Gysins' works are interesting--Gysin had the idea
in the Fifties that writing lagged behind painting--
        In Spring and All W.C. Williams already was using painting as a
model--

i'll mention here what i just backchanneled to jena, partly because
taylor's informative reply points out that relevant criticism is scarce:
i have a collaborative essay, 'deformance and interpretation' (written
with jerome mcgann), which engages the matter of playing
with/rearranging texts as a mode of critical response (it doesn't
specifically or exclusively dealing with 'found' texts).  it is in the
latest =new literary history= (30.1).

Isidore Ducasse/Le Comte de Lautreamont borrowed texts of all sorts and
incorporated them into his Maldoror (1868/69) amd in his Poesies (1870).
 Both are probably the earliest examples of found poetry and the use of
readymade art in Western lit.

Alex Cigale devoted one issue of Synaesthetic mag. to found texts and
has written an interesting essay regarding the same.

          For The Birds

The Birds are whispering
Tweets into my ears
Tweet tweet
Tweet tweet
I must be a Saint
St. All of a Sudden

What are they tweeting?
That is between
Me and the Birds

Now I am in The Birds
And they are in me
They are dive-bombing me
They seem no longer
To regard me as saint
And I seem to be running
As St. Alfred Lord Hitchcock
Screams out "Cut! Cut!"

However the Birds are not cutting
They are not whispering Tweets anymore either
They are slicing and diving
And I am running across the desert

Is it because I would not tell my own people
The secrets of the Birds?
Who are my people, anyway, I ponder
Now that I am a movie star

As I stumble on in the desert
Upon the answers I receive
Divine illumination and I see
Tiny insects swarm round the heads
Of the Birds that swarm round me
Tiny insects dive-bomb Birds
Birds dive-bomb me

I can no longer translate
Tweet tweet into Bzz bzz
Why do you hate me so
I wrote this in the movies
Even in the dark these thoughts
Do not stop dive-bombing
It is dark here
It is hard to write in the dark
It is hard to think in the dark
The bombing outside takes on a steady rhythm
As I pull down my mask, get runway clearance
And take off with my babies under my wings
Claws extended, bill open and screaming
Tweet tweet

Dear Stephen,

I agree for the most part (don't know abt the human body/roman sewer) that
pluralism is the enemy of opposition (from whence "political" poetry
springs) and
'love' is but another sort of pluralism, generous as it is it lets one
forget his or
her enemies (Spicer said know your enemies) . . . and yet I bet plenty of
people
on this list could name one or two enemies of poetry (some institution say .
. .
a finger has been pointed at Barnes & Noble in the past . . . ).  Confused
about
"funding by conservative think-tank money" . . . ?  People don't want to
bite
the hand that feeds, you say?  elaboration? examples? thanks.

 My husband sent me this nice bit of British bitchcraft from  _The
 Independent_ :

 "  . . . I have
 followed Andrew Motion's career with interest and
 affection ever since he published his first book twenty or
 so years ago. But try as I can to recall any of his poetry, I
 find it impossible. His watery pastiches, first of Edward
 Thomas, then of Philip Larkin, then of Ted Hughes, just
 don't stay in your head. He must be the dullest, the least
 memorable, published poet alive. How then did he come to
 be appointed?

 "Watch out for Andrew," Larkin once said to me.
 "Cultivate him. I like him, but he's the Spender de nos
 jours." Anyone who knew Larkin's view of Stephen
 Spender would not have taken this as a compliment. Larkin
 shared Evelyn Waugh's view of Spender as a man with an
 idea of himself as a poet who unfortunately lacked the skill
 to write poetry.

 Larkin - destined to have his reputation trashed by
 Motion's biography of him - had seen a truth about Motion
 which I, who knew him so much less well, had failed to
 spot. When I first knew Andrew he was a blond-haired
 figure with mascara'd eyelashes and wrist bangles who
 bore a disconcerting resemblance to Dame Hilda Bracket.
 One imagined that, as was often the way with the more
 orchidaceous undergraduates, he would one day don a pair
 of cricketing flannels and get a job teaching English at a
 prep school. He amazed us all when in his twenties by
 having his portrait painted. He had a lot of amusing
 friends, all trying to be the Harold Acton of the 1970s, and
 one assumed he would be like them.

 After we'd lost touch, it was surprising to notice him
 plodding through the rungs of committee-dom, sitting on the
 literature panel of this and the sub-committee of that,
 Widmerpooling for poetry while failing to produce a
 single memorable poem.

 In the Times a few days ago he was quizzed about some
 novel he'd written in which one of the characters is writing
 a thesis on "Tennyson's laureate poems, for God's sake".
 Instead of saying that this was a mere novel, written ages
 ago, that he couldn't remember it, Motion replied
 ponderously that this had been intended as "a joke at my
 own expense".

 Hang on. This novel was written in his thirties, or when he
 was even younger. And he was making "a joke at my own
 expense" about the laureateship? So even then he thought
 of himself as laureate material? In his twenties? In his
 teens? It is one thing to dream of being a poet when you're
 16. To dream of being Poet Laureate, though - that's as
 depressing as the young William Hague with his "Hey, hey,
 we're the Monkees" hairstyle attending Tory party
 conferences before he'd had his first snog . . ."

 --A.N. Wilson

 Can anyone confirm my suspicions about "snogging"?  The whole piece

What mean you by what mean you.

Claiming that people aren't involved in politics or do not take a
political stance, isn't that just a code for 'why haven't you taken
power?' or 'Were you assuming that power was going to be given to you at
an appropriate time?' or 'Don't you know what power is and what will
happen to you if you don't have it?'

Claiming that people who claim to be writing poetry aren't really writing
poetry, isn't that a code for 'no exemptions from withholding'?

Dear All-

  I have some personal, selfish questions to ask about Europe. I'm going in
September to Paris, Prague, Vienna and Venice/Florence. It's only the second
time I've been to Europe. My husband and I are going as tourists - but I'd
appreciate any related poetry info. I'd, of course, be happy to give readings
in any of those places or to go to readings there or to meet list folk there
or just to get advice about hotels and restaurants, etc. We'll be landing in
Paris on Sept. 8, going to Praqgue on the 11th, to Vienna around the 14th or
15th and to Italy around the 17th. Anyone with any helpful thoughts, please
backchannel.  Thanks!

  Rae Armantrout

Re Jena Ostman's query about found texts and Annie Finch's answer, =
May I humbly suggest that in a sense my own Visual Voices: The Poem =
As a Print Object, preceded by my introduction in explanation, is =
based on traditional English-language verse that I treat as print =
objects, found as poems in print and used as print-poems.

Subject:      SERIAL DIAGRAM
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

To All

Has anyone ever come across a diagram of the serial form?
I'm reading Conte's UNENDING DESIGN and working on the serial form in oz
poetry.  One of oz's excellent cultural theorists, Stephen Muecke,
writing on the stories of an Aboriginal writer, Butcher Joe, writes that
the series is a "nomadological feature, like that of travelling through
the coutnry, one place after another, and a chain of stories, 'and then
...  and then  ...  and then'."

The diagram I have in my mind when I attempt to illustrate (explain) the
serial poems I'm working with is a spiral.  Now the spiral is very much
a part of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island
cultures....

any thoughts?

regards
deb
